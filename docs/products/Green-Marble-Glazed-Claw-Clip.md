      <li>Good hold , once it is on the hair .</li>
      <li>Good quality material</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good looking and is nicely made.</li>
      <li>and I keep these kind of hairclips in the car, or handbag, just in case.</li>
      <li>This pretty greenish hair claw clip arrived promptly, and was beautifully packaged.  </li>
      <li>This is a fabulous hair clip!</li>
      <li>I anticipate using this for many years.</li>
      <li>I really like it, and believe it&#x27;s a good purchase for the price.</li>
      <li>This is a very pretty and high quality clip, and a good size.</li>
      <li>True to the color, and strong spring.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ll see, but so far, love it, it&#x27;s very comfortable.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s better to buy this kind of things with actual pictures on hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very pretty.</li>
      <li>It is a beautiful clip but it does not have any green in it which is why I bought it.  </li>
      <li>The cheap ones just don&#x27;t work.. Getting ready to order from this company again.</li>
      <li>it came super fast as well!</li>
      <li>It holds a fair amount of hair, though my hair is very long, so I can&#x27;t use it for anything other than putting the sides up on top.</li>
      <li>It seems to be made of a good-quality plastic, with a strong spring, and should hold up to regular use.  </li>
      <li>I have fine, thin hair and this clip is engineered to work for my hair -- or for people who have had better luck in the hair growth department.  </li>
      <li>Very well made and worth the couple extra bucks.  </li>
      <li>Sturdy and cute little clip.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s definitely more brown than green,</li>
      <li>Not enough green, mostly tortoise.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lovely smoky grey and amber hairclip, but I wanted green as shown in picture.</li>
      <li>Nice color, but a little smaller than I expected.</li>
      <li>The spring was super tight at first, but has loosened a little with regular use, making it a bit easier to open.  </li>
      <li>so it may be hard to open if you&#x27;re used to cheap clips.</li>
      <li>It IS green and gold, the pattern on mine is much more symmetrical with the gold lines and green background.</li>
      <li>I have very thick hair and this clip is fantastic.</li>

<li> This is a beautiful clip but the spring is very tight and a little difficult for me to wrangle.</li>
<li> It is a harder claw clip to open, but I don&#x27;t mind that.</li>
<li> A well-made clip, larger than the little Goody clips you buy in grocery stores, but not humongous.  </li>
<li> There&#x27;s no green and hardly any of the gold in clip I got.</li>
<li> My only problem with it is its weight: it&#x27;s a bit on the heavy side</li>
<li> It is definitely a khaki green and gold -comparable</li>
<li> Some other reviews say there&#x27;s no green in it, but at least the clip I received is just as green as in the picture (a soft sage sort of green).  </li>
<li> was so disappointed that I had to give it to a friend, because my hair is baby fine.  </li>
<li> Firm grip, but not worth the $9 price.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s tight and holds my hair well.  </li>
<li> The plastic is sturdy and the spring is tight.  </li>
<li> I have lost a few and have no issue with adding another one onto an Amazon order a few times a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It&#x27;s got the prettiest pattern of green and brown kinda layered maybe.</li>
<li> to the lighter green in camo- for those who are unsure of the color.  </li>
<li> Too heavy and hard to grab hair</li>
<li> It stays in place and doesn&#x27;t flip-flop around like some clips I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
<li> I have very thick</li>
<li> It is a bit expensive compared to the hair clips that I can buy at the store, but this doesn&#x27;t break.</li>

    <li> Too heavy and hard to grab hair</li>
    <li> Love this clip!! It&#x27;s got the prettiest pattern of green and brown kinda layered maybe. Good quality material so it may be hard to open if you&#x27;re used to cheap clips. I have no problem opening it and it stays in my hair great!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful clip. It IS green and gold, the pattern on mine is much more symmetrical with the gold lines and green background. It is a harder claw clip to open, but I don&#x27;t mind that. It says &amp;#34;made in France&amp;#34; inside the clip. I hope it holds up years like the Medusa Made in France clips! We&#x27;ll see, but so far, love it, it&#x27;s very comfortable. it came super fast as well! I think I may get another and see if the pattern differs. Can&#x27;t go wring with these for the price...and I keep these kind of hairclips in the car, or handbag, just in case.</li>
    <li> Beautiful hair clip. True to the color, and strong spring. It keeps your hair in place.</li>
    <li> Nice color, but a little smaller than I expected. My fault for not measuring. I gave it to my granddaughter.</li>
    <li> This is not your Goody-style clip.  The plastic is sturdy and the spring is tight.  Very well made and worth the couple extra bucks.  I anticipate using this for many years.</li>
    <li> This pretty greenish hair claw clip arrived promptly, and was beautifully packaged.  Note to consumer:  This clip is for a lady with LOTS of hair!&lt;br /&gt;I was so disappointed that I had to give it to a friend, because my hair is baby fine.  My mistake, I thought the clip was smaller.  It&#x27;s almost 3-inches in length!  Having recently visited the Hair Clip counter at Harrod&#x27;s in London, this clip would have been $100.  So if you have a mane of hair, buy it!  It&#x27;s good looking and is nicely made.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and cute little clip.  It is definitely a khaki green and gold -comparable to the lighter green in camo- for those who are unsure of the color.  It holds a fair amount of hair, though my hair is very long, so I can&#x27;t use it for anything other than putting the sides up on top. It seems to be made of a good-quality plastic, with a strong spring, and should hold up to regular use.  The spring was super tight at first, but has loosened a little with regular use, making it a bit easier to open.  I really like it, and believe it&#x27;s a good purchase for the price.</li>
    <li> Not enough green, mostly tortoise. Firm grip, but not worth the $9 price.</li>
    <li> A well-made clip, larger than the little Goody clips you buy in grocery stores, but not humongous.  Some other reviews say there&#x27;s no green in it, but at least the clip I received is just as green as in the picture (a soft sage sort of green).  It&#x27;s tight and holds my hair well.  I&#x27;d like to get a bunch of others from the same maker!</li>
    <li> it feels solid but looks smaller than I expect. it&#x27;s better to buy this kind of things with actual pictures on hair.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin hair and this clip is engineered to work for my hair -- or for people who have had better luck in the hair growth department.  It&#x27;s also very pretty.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful clip but the spring is very tight and a little difficult for me to wrangle.</li>
    <li> This clip is made of the best quality I have ever owned.  It is a beautiful clip but it does not have any green in it which is why I bought it.  It is all tortoise shell colored.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lovely smoky grey and amber hairclip, but I wanted green as shown in picture. There&#x27;s no green and hardly any of the gold in clip I got.</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty and high quality clip, and a good size. My only problem with it is its weight: it&#x27;s a bit on the heavy side and I find I choose to use my lighter clips over this one.</li>
    <li> Good hold , once it is on the hair . But it takes both my hands to force it open . I have been using for a month now , it still hasn&#x27;t loosened up .</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous hair clip! I always have two in my drawer, one in my car, and one in my bag--and almost always one in my hair. It does have a tight spring, but it is not hard to manage. I have an elbow injury and can easily open and place it around my thick-ish curly hair. It stays in place and doesn&#x27;t flip-flop around like some clips I&#x27;ve had in the past. I have lost a few and have no issue with adding another one onto an Amazon order a few times a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely more brown than green, but I don&#x27;t consider that an issue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought plastic hair clips before, and the teeth of the clip break when trying to put in my hair.  I have very thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good sturdy clip, very attractive.  It is a bit expensive compared to the hair clips that I can buy at the store, but this doesn&#x27;t break.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and this clip is fantastic. The cheap ones just don&#x27;t work.. Getting ready to order from this company again. Great product.</li>
