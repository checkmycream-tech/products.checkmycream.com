      <li>and I love them.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of Exhale.</li>

      <li>They&#x27;re affordable and they smell really lovely.</li>

      <li>Great essentail oil that I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Very good for helping to breath, for deep coughs, or lung issues.</li>
      <li>They do not price gouge like the other guys and the quality of the oil is superior!!</li>
      <li>We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>Better than Vicks, &amp; no questionable ingredients!</li>
      <li>Great therapeutic oils for your diffuser or to use for different ailments.</li>
      <li>I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM.</li>
      <li>It has been very useful in decongesting my sinuses.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed much faster shipping results through Fabulous Frannie.</li>
      <li>So I think it really does help you breath better</li>
      <li>I tried this after using Breathe Easier from the same company and found this vastly superior.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brand.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly, packaged well and as described.</li>
      <li>That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden.</li>
      <li>I received a woodsy oil ( can&#x27;t remember the actual name) , but I liked it so much that I kept it rather than calling customer service. :)</li>
      <li>I use it in a diffuser and it smells quite &amp;#34;herbal&amp;#34; but fresh and not at all overpowering.</li>
      <li>My first time to order from this company.</li>
      <li>I have bought several edens gardens oils and I LOVE their stuff</li>
      <li>I love Edens Garden essential oils.  </li>
      <li>so I am sure this one won&#x27;t be any different.</li>
      <li>I have purchased dozens of their oils and keep coming back for more.</li>
      <li>Love this essential oil scent.</li>
      <li>It really works on a fairly serious chronic nasal blockage problem and greatly aids my sleep.</li>
      <li>This stuff came very quick, and I put a little on the inside of my sweater coat, near the top of the zipper</li>
      <li>and I can smell it all day, has really helped.</li>
      <li>I really like the &amp;#34;Exhale&amp;#34; it has helped me with my seasonal allergies.</li>
      <li>It really worked to help me breathe easier.</li>
      <li>This helps me so much.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this in my  water based air purifier and I really like it.  </li>
      <li>Very relaxing</li>
      <li>This one really helps with my congestion and asthma.  </li>
      <li>and it really helped me sleep through the night.</li>
      <li>Now I still use it just because I like it so much.</li>
      <li>decent quality, fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers.</li>
      <li>I bought this particular one for my asthma</li>
      <li>I was led to thes oils highly recommend them.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s my first time using essential oils</li>
      <li>I used this for the first time last night and when I got up this morning and started my coffee</li>
      <li>A drop just inside the ear will clear the sinuses in moments.</li>
      <li>and so far have not noticed any change but will continue to use</li>
      <li>Seems to work well so far.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t smell anything, sinuses are shot, and my nose has been red and swollen from blowing it so much.</li>
      <li>They are up there wit DoTerra and Young Living</li>
      <li>Use it every other night and use Breathe easy the other nights.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t appreciate having to wait so long for a product to arrive from so cal when I only live in Oregon.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for the past few nights in my diffuser I have noticed that I sleep better.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Arrived in good condition. Product has a nice smell, though not quite as strong as Breathe by doTERRA, it is still a good product for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a must!!!  I suffer from sinus headaches and allergies and this has been a life saver!!!!</li>
    <li> Very potent and therapeutic blend. Perfect for sinus infections, colds, or allergies. Edens Garden rocks!!</li>
    <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
    <li> It works so well to help breathe better.  It clears the sinuses.</li>
    <li> I have a cold right now and have been using this oil. It has been very useful in decongesting my sinuses. I use it in a diffuser and it smells quite &amp;#34;herbal&amp;#34; but fresh and not at all overpowering.</li>
    <li> Very nice. .one of the ones I use more often</li>
    <li> Great product, I use it on massage clients</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time last night and when I got up this morning and started my coffee I noticed I was coughing up mucus from my lungs. Will continue to use and see if it still does it tonight. So I think it really does help you breath better</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this in my  water based air purifier and I really like it.  I&#x27;ve just recently had a terrible bronchial infection and my lungs are so tender.  This soothes them at night and my breathing is easier and less painful.  Will be purchasing more as needed.</li>
    <li> Worked great for my daughters allergies</li>
    <li> This is similar to Young Living&#x27;s &amp;#34;Raven,&amp;#34; without the crazy expense.  Great to diffuse when you&#x27;re congested, or put a drop on your throat or on your hands, rub them together, &amp; smell.  Better than Vicks, &amp; no questionable ingredients!</li>
    <li> I tried this after using Breathe Easier from the same company and found this vastly superior. It really works on a fairly serious chronic nasal blockage problem and greatly aids my sleep.</li>
    <li> Bought when the kids had a cold, seems to work for us.  decent quality, fast shipping.  I would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I only gave this a 4, not because I don&#x27;t like it but because I bought this for my lung problems and have not used it yet. I have bought several edens gardens oils and I LOVE their stuff so I am sure this one won&#x27;t be any different.</li>
    <li> Eden&#x27;s Garden is the best oils they are pure and I love them.  They are up there wit DoTerra and Young Living so thank I was led to thes oils highly recommend them.  Exhale fits at the top as well.</li>
    <li> Husband was having sinus headache so put a few drops in vitamin E oil to diffuse and applied to his neck &amp; temples before bed. In the morning he said it helped him sleep.  I also use this at night for sinus relief.</li>
    <li> I love this blend it works great for my son!  I will continue to order through Edens Garden they ship on time and have a great product!! They do not price gouge like the other guys and the quality of the oil is superior!!</li>
    <li> I really like the &amp;#34;Exhale&amp;#34; it has helped me with my seasonal allergies. I put a couple of drops in my hands, cup them and breathe it in. I also use it in my difuser, which also helps me breathe easier. Great essentail oil that I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great when having chest congestion or asthma. I got this for a couple friends with asthma and they love it!</li>
    <li> Nothing like Doterra Breathe.  Unless I got a defective bottle.... It doesn&#x27;t smell like doterra and it didn&#x27;t help at all with my sinuses.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t experienced in change in sleep patterns as indicated.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Exhale. I have been suffering with my allergies bad so far this year. Can&#x27;t smell anything, sinuses are shot, and my nose has been red and swollen from blowing it so much. This stuff came very quick, and I put a little on the inside of my sweater coat, near the top of the zipper and I can smell it all day, has really helped. I can breathe again!</li>
    <li> Great scent. Eden gardens makes really nice blends. They&#x27;re affordable and they smell really lovely. This one really helps with my congestion and asthma.  I use it in an ion diffuser by my bedside. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone with asthma or allergies.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brand. I have purchased dozens of their oils and keep coming back for more. I bought this particular one for my asthma and I sniff or diffuse it when I am having a flare up.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, packaged well and as described. This is a strong scent, nice for clogged sinuses.</li>
    <li> It works!!!!! Makes the room smell nice, and I can breathe!</li>
    <li> Love this essential oil scent. I place a few drops in my kids&#x27; diffusers at night.</li>
    <li> Great therapeutic oils for your diffuser or to use for different ailments.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my diffuser and used it recently when I had some chest congestion. It really worked to help me breathe easier. Smells and feels like the the Vicks Vapo Steam you use with vaporizers</li>
    <li> Just ordered my second bottle! I love going to sleep to this scent! Very relaxing</li>
    <li> Has helped with breathing at night</li>
    <li> I use this in th evenings to help with nasal congestion! Seems to work well so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for the past few nights in my diffuser I have noticed that I sleep better. I wake up feeling more refreshed and energetic throughout the day. I will def keep purchasing this product in the future. I am now on my second purchase of this item. I am dissapointed that my product left the carrier facility on the 27th and I ordered and paid on the 23rd. I don&#x27;t appreciate having to wait so long for a product to arrive from so cal when I only live in Oregon. Especially since I have to pay for shipping. I enjoyed much faster shipping results through Fabulous Frannie.</li>
    <li> My first time to order from this company. Great quality and fast service. I actually didnt receive the oil I ordered - I received a woodsy oil ( can&#x27;t remember the actual name) , but I liked it so much that I kept it rather than calling customer service. :)</li>
    <li> Use it at night in my difuser.</li>
    <li> We use this so often during cold and flu season. A drop just inside the ear will clear the sinuses in moments.</li>
    <li> Smells great &amp; very strong. Love it!</li>
    <li> I like this. I put it on my Chest before I sleep and I feel my airway open up. My husband says I snore less when I use it, maybe due to open air passages? I also like how it smells. I first used it when I was sick  and it really helped me sleep through the night. Now I still use it just because I like it so much.</li>
    <li> Love to use this in my diffuser.</li>
    <li> These oils are just as they sated and they work as well and smell as good as those three times the price. I was very happy with these. They adjusted the shipping with the amount I bought which made the cost even better!!</li>
    <li> Very good for helping to breath, for deep coughs, or lung issues. Use it every other night and use Breathe easy the other nights. Firm believer in essential oils</li>
    <li> Great oils for great prices.</li>
    <li> This smells great. I actually am using it for my dog who suffers from difficult in breathing, and snores. It helps him stop snoring and me sleep.</li>
    <li> I diffuse this blend in the evenings or put a couple of drops on my pillow or dilute with a carrier oil and rub on my neck.  I have bad congestion issues with allergies and this EO allows me to go medicine free!!  I have loved all of the Eden&#x27;s Garden oils I have purchased.  I have been using them for about 6 months with great success!!</li>
    <li> Love the synergy blend! I have asthma and this helps me to breath better at night. I love it for my girls too.</li>
    <li> Nice oil.I got it to help my breathing and so far have not noticed any change but will continue to use</li>
    <li> I bought this for Burning Man (yeah I&#x27;m someone who reads the crazy excel packing list that floats around every year, and this product and link is on it all over the web).... DAMN it works well. Not only that, but it&#x27;s my first time using essential oils and I think it&#x27;s going to suck me in to use others as well. A few dabs in a respirator during/after a dust storm really do wonders to open up your respiratory system.</li>
    <li> This blend is amazing! Instantly clearing my airways and causing drainage after days of congestion. Great smell as well.</li>
    <li> Love the oils and the price.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.  Helps with my morning stuffiness.  Great company.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love Edens Garden essential oils.  I use them every single day multiple times.  Exhale is especially good in the winter.</li>
    <li> This helps me so much. I have asthma and allergies. It has also helped my husband to snore less.  I&#x27;m allergic to pine trees including the oil. A lot of the blends for cold or to help with breathing contains pine. This is the exception. I love this product and will be buying again when I run out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not duterra Breathe.  But it&#x27;s good if you&#x27;re not picky about that.</li>
