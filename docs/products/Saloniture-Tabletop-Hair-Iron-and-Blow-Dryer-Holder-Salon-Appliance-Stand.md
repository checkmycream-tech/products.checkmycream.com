      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t slide around, it has little rubber feet that keep it from sliding so no need to secure.  </li>
      <li>The wholes should be bigger and deeper but it still works really well for all but one hairdryer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a busy stylist and this keeps everything at my finger tips.  </li>
      <li>Bought it for my 16 yr old granddaughter to keep her curling irons, hair blowers etc.</li>
      <li>stand is very well made and solid, so two stars for that and prompt delivery.</li>
      <li>Well, as a previous reviewer had said, the larger curling iron won&#x27;t fit into any of the openings</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love is a lil heavy so it hold the blower really well.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly like i suspected, got it for my wife who&#x27;s a hairstylist. Usps sucks though</li>
    <li> It is a great product</li>
    <li> This product is great! It fits all of my hair appliances nicely, including my hair crimper which is rather large! I only wish it fit better on my narrow sink as it was a tad bit bigger than I anticipated.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter and she loves it. With a straightener, blow dryer and curling iron, it helps to keep things off of her bureau. It is also great for when the appliances are cooling off.</li>
    <li> I was glad that the size was small enough for a small desk in a small room. Safe for not getting counter tops hot. Was a little small curling irons but was ok for what i needed.</li>
    <li> Perfect for our small bathroom and all of my styling tools.</li>
    <li> Great product. Does exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> Product is much smaller than it appears but perfect for a small work station and very sturdy.  Plus great price!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my new start in cosmetology</li>
    <li> Love this...get so many comments on where did I get it....super great</li>
    <li> The product did not have the mounting brackets as advertised</li>
    <li> I should have looked at the measurements.  It is a bit small.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy and keeps my daughters vanity in order, thinking of purchasing another for my wife!</li>
    <li> Heavy. Useful. Perfect. Love it.</li>
    <li> The hairdryer hole is a bit too small. The product is constructed of great materials.  Don&#x27;t listen other people who don&#x27;t trust the plastic.  Aren&#x27;t most curling irons covered by a curved piece of plastic?  It is made to take the heat.  The wholes should be bigger and deeper but it still works really well for all but one hairdryer.</li>
    <li> Looks and works good. As described, but I wish the hole for the hair dryer was a little bit bigger. One of ours does not fit.</li>
    <li> Although I liked this item, had to return it because it didn&#x27;t fit in the space I had available.  The return was easy &amp; a refund made it back to paypal. Thanks</li>
    <li> This product wasn&#x27;t actually useable! The angel don&#x27;t work with any, pound&#x27;s that I actually use daily! Very disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> This product fits in a small space,holds 2 flat irons 3 curling irons and a hair dryer is not combersom Great product if you can,t nail anything to the wall. Made of metal , not heavy but heavy enough not to slide when u grab tools... Great Product.</li>
    <li> every thing was perfect</li>
    <li> I like the holder but was exspecting it to maybe be a little bigger. it does what i bought it for so its fine. The product its self is nice nothing wrong with it at all.</li>
    <li> Its great! Heavier than I thought it would be perfect on my work station, Great for a small work station!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Quick shipment at a fabulous price</li>
    <li> Just what I was expecting.. love it!!:)</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I needed! I use three different sizes of curling irons and a mini flat iron on my hair, and this stand holds all of these items. I use the spare holder to hold my combs. It keeps everything orgabnized, the cords untangled, and my styling counter very tidy. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my 16 yr old granddaughter to keep her curling irons, hair blowers etc. in a neat and small space. great item.</li>
    <li> Great product keeps your styling area clean &amp; safe!!! No hot tools on the counter, no burning cords... Just organized heat safe bliss!!</li>
    <li> sturdy..top quality product</li>
    <li> This thing is tiny! Way too small for any &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; styling tools! And wanted to return it but the seller says I&#x27;m responsible for the return shipping expenses.... Which makes no sense for me to spend $12 to send back when the damn thing was $18....  Would NOT recommend.... Unless it is used for mini tools.</li>
    <li> I guess this is good for someone who works at the salon but i dont. I purchased this because i thought all my hair tools would fit but they weren&#x27;t. Its a good product though but i decided to return it. It came on time and well packaged.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Only complaint I have is my babyliss straighten won&#x27;t fit in it, but other than that very good. Fits perfect on top of my station, don&#x27;t take much room.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty sturdy and works well for what I needed it for.  I have it setting on a shelf by my shampoo bowl and it doesn&#x27;t slide around, it has little rubber feet that keep it from sliding so no need to secure.  It is well made and sturdy, the only reason I deducted one star is the tubes that your curling iron and combs fit it is too shallow.  You need to watch your curling iron and tools to make sure they don&#x27;t fall out, but overall works great!</li>
    <li> too small its kinda a shoe regular box size and my 1 1/2 ,2&amp;#34; and 3&amp;#34; curlers dnt fit at all too too too small</li>
    <li> I really like this item it fits nicely in my closet it holds 3 curling irons&lt;br /&gt;2 flat irons 1 dryer. Very will made has weight to it does not tip over well worth the money</li>
    <li> I really liked the product, however it did not fit in the space that I had available.  Needed to return product. Was a great &amp; timely transaction. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Good solid device for a salon.</li>
    <li> These work amazing for my salon.</li>
    <li> The wife is loving the shizznit out of it....</li>
    <li> The openings are not the sizes I needed for my hair accessories. I was hoping that my large curling iron would fit in the slot. However it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> It works great! keeps heat off my vanity and I can have all my tools accessible.</li>
    <li> Well, as a previous reviewer had said, the larger curling iron won&#x27;t fit into any of the openings and I don&#x27;t use a flat iron. I knew better, but took the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is very well made and solid, so two stars for that and prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> I love the idea and look of this holder but why would they make the inside parts that are supposed to hold hot appliances out of plastic??  Can&#x27;t this be redesigned by making the outside of the unit out of plastic and the inner holders out of metal?  That would make so much more sense.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Great doesn&#x27;t shift off counter</li>
    <li> Excellent storage for all hair needs</li>
    <li> I like it and it sits sturdy on my desk, but the only thing is that the last curling iron holder is not big enough for a 1.5 inch curler, and I don&#x27;t know what the left two slots are for?</li>
    <li> Way to heavy and bulky for my bathroom countertop.</li>
    <li> Heavy duty,  just what I expected!  love having this for my blowdryer and and curling irons.</li>
    <li> I feel like this is perfect for the cosmetologists on the go.  The ones that do their family and friend&#x27;s hair for free while they take their stuff from their home shop...solid, excellent quality and not priced bad at all.  I would recommend for anyone who wants or needs it.</li>
    <li> Great organizational product --- keeps things neat inside or outside of a cabinet. Bery well made, too.</li>
    <li> Appliances do not stay in holder.  Plastic pieces can melt. Not what I expected.</li>
    <li> This is a sturdy product but the hole where you put the flat iron and blower are made of plastic so be careful not to put it there while it is super hot. Still i like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy and well-made, however I was disappointed that the openings were smaller than I expected and two of my curling irons cannot even fit into the holes.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy.  No complaints.  The next time I will purchase the stand with electrical plugs also.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Very nice and strong well made</li>
    <li> Its an ok product from what i can tell but i am returning it because i really dont like removing the diffuser from my blow dryer and because of that it wont fit. I also would be a little worried about the plastic melting off on my irons</li>
    <li> I am returning this item. The item was not what I expected, I thought this item was made of a more steel frame and it was not.  The inside part where the heated irons and blow dryer would be placed was made of a plastic like material which in my opinion, being a hair stylist would not withstand the heat of heated styling materials. Therefore I will be returning this item.</li>
    <li> Great item. It was exactly what was needed to clear up the clutter on my bathroom counter. Very excited about this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love how organized my station is now.  I&#x27;m a busy stylist and this keeps everything at my finger tips.  It&#x27;s high quality at a great price. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t hold my hairdryer.</li>
    <li> Very well made. Will work perfect.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit any of my irons or hair dryer. Bent in shipping.</li>
    <li> Pretty happy with this unit.  Bought because my teen daughters have multiple irons and I didn&#x27;t want them burning the sink, etc.  Plus, it keeps things organized on the counter.  I&#x27;m leery to have them put the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; iron in the holder because the tubes seem to be plastic, but it&#x27;s good for all the other reasons.</li>
    <li> Perfect space saver. Love it!</li>
    <li> very sturdy product but the storage holes don&#x27;t seem deep enough to completely secure each item.</li>
</ol>
