<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the medicinal smell and it didn&#x27;t do anything for my flakes after a month of use.</li>
    <li> I have a super sensitive scalp and have tried tons of shampoos over the years, from mass-market brands to salon products and natural remedies, too. This is the first one I&#x27;ve gone back to purchase again, despite the fact that it&#x27;s a bit pricey. It&#x27;s done a great job of settling down my reactive skin (no funny chemicals or allergenic issues), and unlike some other natural shampoos, it still has a great lather, a nice herbal smell and actually leaves my hair looking nice (though perhaps not as smooth as I would like...hence the deduction of 1 star). Also, I have color-treated hair and this shampoo doesn&#x27;t make it fade (unlike some others I&#x27;ve tried).&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve had similar trouble finding an all-around good shampoo, I would definitely recommend giving this one a try.</li>
    <li> The first time i used it i was &amp;#34;wowed&amp;#34; after that i didnt see a difference, it did nothing for my dandruff or the itching basically my hair was soft. Im african american and my face does flare up from having eczema and i put a little on the flared up spots and it worked great. So every now n then i just use a little on my face.</li>
    <li> Iam using this shampoo from past 2 weeks. It is giving relief from itchy scalp. And above all its all natural and homeopathic shampoo.  It has a subtle fragrance. It lathers up very well. Unlike other dandruff shampoos it  is not  making the hair brittle.</li>
    <li> Did not really cure the white flakes in my scalp plus it made my hair dry. But it is great to clean products out in hair.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this shampoo for 2 weeks as directed but still has dandruff.</li>
    <li> Good product I have seen a difference since I started using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of different shampoos and this is the first time I&#x27;ve seen and felt instant results. The shampoo felt gentle and soothing on my scalp.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for nearly a year. It is great if you have keratin and cannot use shampoos with sodium chloride, but have issues with your scalp. It soothes irritation after the keratin and color and prevents flaking. It is excellent for dandruff and eczema control . I highly recommend it !</li>
    <li> I have always had issues with my scalp, and am always looking to try new products.  Hands down I noticed a difference when using the Sage Shampoo.  I alternate between this and the Maple Holistics Tea Tree shampoo.  I have a lot of thick hair and the smallest drop of this shampoo goes a long way(quite amazing).  I have only tried the two products mentioned but overall I have been more than satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It removes and controls my dandruff issue. It does leave your hair very dry so it&#x27;s important to condition.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I started experiencing flaking of my scalp.  I tried several products from my grocery store--they actually made matters it worse.  I&#x27;ve always had a very healthy scalp and hair, so this was very upsetting.  After searching on-line--I came upon this product.  It&#x27;s gentle, only takes a really small amount, (so it last a long time), smells wonderful, and relieved the inching.  My scalp is clear but I love the shampoo so I&#x27;ve continued using it.</li>
    <li> Great product....Love it...better than any other brand...I have been using another brands for years and I haven&#x27;t found a product that actually eradicate my dandruff ....Will continue buying this product every month....</li>
    <li> I thought this shampoo will stop hair loss. I was wrong but I will continue using it, as well. That&#x27;s because it does clean your hair better than any shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It definitely helps my dry scalp that I have been experiencing for years. It smells great and not only that, Its ORGANIC!</li>
    <li> Great, natural product!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x60;ve been trying several organic shampoos and I have been disappointed with their quality in the past. This product really leaves my scalp feeling very clean and my hair soft. I will definitely re-order this product! And the price is reasonable as well!</li>
    <li> Works!&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;- love that it&#x27;s natural and free of harsh chemicals&lt;br /&gt;-lathers up w/o sulfates&lt;br /&gt;- smells nice&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t cure the dandruff entirely, but does provides symptomatic relief.&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;- the cost is a bit steep</li>
    <li> I recently started getting dandruff due to our local hard water. My scalp was severely dry, extremely itchy and I really felt like I had flees. I know how toxic the other brands are and was looking for something non-toxic. This shampoo is awesome! I use it every other day and apply it twice as the directions say to and I have been dandruff and more importantly itch free since a week after I bought it. I am extremely happy I came across this on amazon because nothing was working for me, at least holistically. Thank you Maple Holistics!</li>
    <li> too strong for my scalp, the dandruff got worse.</li>
    <li> I have recently started coloring my hair and needed to find a shampoo that helps with dandruff and is safe for color this fits the bill nicely.</li>
    <li> I have a patch of psoriasis on my scalp which acts up sometimes.  I wanted to find something natural to use to help with the itching and flaking. I don&#x27;t want to use the expensive and potent steroid that the dermatologist prescribed. I&#x27;ve tried some OTC shampoo and lotion options, but they don&#x27;t really seem to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo helps to keep things calm and itch free. It&#x27;s not drying like many treatment shampoos can be. I was told by the dermatologist that nothing will cure the psoriasis. It&#x27;s more of a maintenance situation. I prefer not to use a drug that can have negative side effects, when a natural shampoo works just as well.</li>
    <li> It did improve my flaking issue but not as much as I thought it would, and it leaves hair really dry. Smells great though and the packaging is nice</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! My son has been suffering from severe dandruff for about a year and I tried everything. This product cleared up most of his dandruff after a single (!) use. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give this product 4.5 stars. With the Sage shampoo, I mainly got it for my dandruff. After the first use, I had less dandruff, but my hair felt more dry. After the second use, my dandruff reduced drastically. After the third and fourth, I really don&#x27;t see any dandruff! It really helps using cold water the last few seconds of your shower on your scalp.  **UPDATE** This actually made my hair really thin out. I stopped using it and within a month my hair felt thicker.</li>
    <li> After using this product for weeks I have noticed less flakes and irritation. I&#x27;m not 100% flake free but it&#x27;s a big improvement. I was afraid this might dry my hair out to much but it seemed gentle though and my hair is still shiny without being oily. I would recommend using this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter.  It is the best shampoo!  Her hair looks soft, full of body and it has soothed her scalp and doesn&#x27;t dry her skin out  (certain products can cause dry/eczema reactions and this has not caused any reactions - yay!).  This shampoo makes her hair look wonderful.  I just wish that I could buy a value price bottle, since 8 oz. doesn&#x27;t last long.  btw - ordering another bottle today and I am going to try their argan oil shampoo and their Vitamin C serum</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to this shampoo based on the positive reviews...unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work. This shampoo is ok but didn&#x27;t help with my flakes as much as I was hoping. Probably will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Helps with my scalp issues. I spent years using tar shampoo and other shampoo recommended by doctors. However, I find that herbal shampoos help better.</li>
    <li> I finally found a shampoo that really cleans my scalp AND hair without sulfate! Amazing. It works so well with dry scalp.</li>
    <li> I have used quite a bunch of herbal shampoos and so far Sage shampoo has been one of the best. My scalp feels very fresh and clean right after couple of uses. I will continue to use this shampoo and recommend it to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with dandruff for years and managing it with Head and Shoulders and T-Gel.  I wanted a sulfate-free/natural shampoo that could still control my dandruff.  This shampoo lasts a while; however, the shampoo smells strongly of tea tree oil, and I still had flakes after using it every day.  It did decrease my dandruff but didn&#x27;t work as well as Head and Shoulders.  For now, I&#x27;ll be switching between this shampoo and Head and Shoulders.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boys and they LOVE it! They are not fond of the odor but they are boys, what do they know about aromatherapy?</li>
    <li> I think this shampoo might be drying out my hair a little bit  - i feel like it happens because you have to use it twice every time you use wash - and leave it in - but for me it&#x27;s kind of worth it because it did clear up 80% of my dandruff, which was getting so bad I think it might&#x27;ve been something worse than dandruff. I had red patches on my scalp from where big thick patches of skin were coming off. I&#x27;m still getting scalp breakouts so I ordered the blue bottle of maple holistics shampoo to see if that helps with the scalp acne. I&#x27;m worried my dandruff will come back - so there&#x27;s a chance I might have to use both shampoos.</li>
    <li> I wanted this to work so badly! Followed instructions, followed up with Maple Holistics conditioner, my scalp was worse within days, and the drought had spread. Great smell, felt good supporting &amp;#34;holistic&amp;#34; body product, timely shipping. ..... but made my dry scalp worse. Hat days until I switched back to my chemical-ful standby. Sad to report this, truly, I was excited and hopeful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it 3 times thus far and love the results. It&#x27;s early yet, but it&#x27;s helped with my scalp dermatitis and anti fungal properties of this shampoo help make my scalp smell better. Great product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is so great! I love having a more natural alternative to the awful and harsh drugstore shampoos I&#x27;ve used in the past. I&#x27;ve sometimes been unhappy with &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products as they may feel different or not lather well but this shampoo is really great. It lathers really well, smells awesome and the bottle lasts such a long time! My scalp is healthy and my hair isn&#x27;t dry. I would recommend this product to anyone with dandruff! The customer service is also absolutely top notch! I&#x27;m hoping to try some other products from this company too!</li>
    <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t see much of a difference. For the price, I was expecting much more. On the positive note, it smells good.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing, and it&#x27;s sulfate free so it doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp like other dandruff shampoos. Still have dandruff but it&#x27;s only been a week so far. Instructions say to leave it in for a few minutes unlike other shampoos so be ready to spend a little extra time standing around.</li>
    <li> In addition to dermatitis, I suffer from severe allergies to fragrance and most of the ingredients in chemical-ridden retail products - from laundry detergent to dish soap to makeup. So I was pretty much forced to find natural alternatives and homemade solutions. I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of products over the last several years that claimed to be organic or natural - and did a good job of hiding the yucky stuff lurking in their ingredients that ultimately caused yet another allergic reaction for me - not pretty or fun. I&#x27;ve gotten more and more educated about what to look for - but it&#x27;s still a struggle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dermatitis on the my scalp is embarrassing and uncomfortable. No treatment, prescription or natural product can eliminate it ... just keep it in control and at bay. There is no magic cure. But I&#x27;ve been using Sage shampoo for just over 3 months now and I hardly notice my dermatitis anymore. I can wear dark colors again - I&#x27;m not embarrassed to get my hair cut and I&#x27;ll let the stylist massage my scalp - I&amp;#34;m not itching my head all the time - I have a lot more confidence and one less thing to worry about. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it every day ... only about 3 times per week. And I don&#x27;t use shampoo at all the other days, only a conditioner for my hair that I try not to let touch my scalp. I have not had any allergic reaction - it&#x27;s working! Give it at least a couple of weeks of regular use before you decide if it&#x27;s working for you or not. But you should notice a difference after the first few shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drinking a lot of water ( 2 liters or 64 oz. per day) is another tip for dermatitis sufferers. Stay hydrated - don&#x27;t let your body or your skin &#x27;dry out&#x27;.</li>
    <li> My aunt loves this product. It is helpful to anti dandruff.</li>
    <li> After a about a month of use, Sage Shampoo seams to be working well.  Used regularly (daily), my scalp is clear and healthy and my hair is softer than it has been in years.  I recently traveled out of town for a week, but did not take any of the Sage Shampoo with me, my mistake.  By the time I arrived back home, my dandruff and dry scalp was back.  I have been using regularly again with good results. The smell is herbal in nature and as stated, leaves my hair soft and clean.</li>
    <li> Scalp Psoriasis for more than 10 years starting to feel a little better. I purchased this product mostly because I saw another review, isn&#x27;t that why we’re all on Amazon? This lady had heavy dandruff and went on and on about sulfates. I honestly had no idea what sulfates were and that they also were present in cleaning products. YIKES! My scalp is already super sensitive and angry red.  I must have 6 different shampoo bottles in my shower today. Naturally I ran to check products I already had and sure enough, sulfates were present in Aveda and even some form of sulfates present in my Jason products. I still like Jason simple because of the salicylic acid. My psoriasis is about the size of my hand up the back of my head. It’s incredibly frustrating because I&#x27;ve never seen it and it consumes a great deal of time to treat. My husband said that the top of my head is mostly white build up and the base of my neck is more red and inflamed. Since using this Sage Shampoo, I can tell I have less build up on the top portion of my scalp and my husband says the bottom of my head is more pink than red . I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 7 days and I can see and feel improvement. It’s no cure but, defiantly something I will continue to keep in my routine.  I would imagine this product would work wonderfully for someone with dandruff if it’s making a difference in my scalp.</li>
    <li> I have washed my hair about 4 times since receiving the product about 3 weeks ago. What I liked the most about the shampoo is that it doesn&#x27;t dry my haor parched like other shampoos. In fact, after using it my hair is still soft and smooth. I also love the aroma, since it comes from natural oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a decrease in itchiness and flakiness. The product is very viscous, and to be able to put it directly on the scalp one has to invest time into carefully parting the hair so it can get in there. Pricey and I try to use the least amount possible. I will try watering it down to see if it still effective that way.</li>
    <li> So far, I really like this.  I have noticed less hair coming out in the shower and my scalp/dandruff seems much better.  I use it along with the Silk 18 conditioner and love both products.  Hopefully I will continue to love it.  Update 4/20 - I am on my second bottle of this and honestly I have noticed my hair getting fuller, like more hair growing in.  I purchased this not so much because I had a dandruff issue, but because I had an &amp;#34;unhealthy scalp&amp;#34; issue.  My scalp is much better than it was.  Still lovin&#x27; this.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Sage shampoo now for about 4 months, I have psoriasis on my scalp that get pretty bad when the weather gets cold and this product really helps to control it without leaving a horrible smell.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> i tried it and it works wonders it shows me less dandruff on my hair after i used it, At first i thought it wouldnt work well but it does!! very good.</li>
    <li> I started using this after a friend recommended it to me, my scalp gets dry &amp; itchy during the winter months. First few times I used it I noticed my scalp felt soothed &amp; no longer itchy. Having naturally dry &amp; oily hair it hasn&#x27;t felt as oily. I also have highlighted hair, and didn&#x27;t notice it drying it out or making it &amp;#34;frizzy&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m definitely a fan of this shampoo &amp; will continue to use it during these winter months. Another bonus it&#x27;s it&#x27;s considered natural &amp; holistic, versus chemicals that are in other dandruff &amp; itchy scalp shampoos.</li>
    <li> Love this product. My boyfriend and myself both periodically get really bad dandruff. We have tried everything, even clinical strength! Nothing helped. This stuff smells great and really reduces the dandruff</li>
    <li> BEST product!!! In the winter I have incredibly bad dandruff and itchy scalp. To the point where I have to constantly wear my hair in a ponytail so you cannot see the dandruff and Head and Shoulders did not work at all. I have been using this shampoo for a few months now and it has improved 100%. No more flakes and no more itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> I just re-ordered my second bottle of Maple Holistics&#x27; Sage dandruff shampoo after being thrilled that it worked!  I had tried prescription strength Ketaconazole and Selenium Sulfide shampoos from my dermatologist and my head was still itchy and my ears were red.  I suspect the Sodium Lauryl Sulphate in these shampoos was a contributing irritant.  I use the Sage shampoo 1x daily and follow that by spraying my head with apple cider vinegar, let sit for 1-3 mins and rinse that off, then rinse finally with really cold water.  Lastly, I briskly brush my scalp with a brush to losen any flakes maybe every few days.  This seems to control my dandruff and itch, YAY!  And the shampoo does smell nice and spicy as described.  I looked up all the ingredients in the Sage shampoo and they&#x27;re all natural based, and gentle. . . worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Really works for dry scalp issues. Have been using now for almost 2 months. It leaves hair soft and shiny, smells like sage and not horrible perfumes and is amazing for dry scalp! Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great. It takes care of dandruff and doesn&#x27;t contain all the bad stuff like most mainstream hair care products do. I travel for work and there&#x27;s a night and day difference in how my hair and scalp look and feel when I use hotel shampoos versus my Sage shampoo at home. Great product, well worth the money. I&#x27;m sticking with it.</li>
    <li> My son love the smell of this shampoo. It has also gotten rid of the flakiness of the dandruff</li>
    <li> smell is great. really works too</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from dandruff for as long as I could remember. When I used this shampoo I was floored with the results. It literally went from one extreme to another within a few washes. I was completely astonished at how healthy and clear of dandruff my scalp and hair had become. I would recommended this product highly to anyone with a similar story to mine. I tried all the other brands and natural remedies and NONE gave the results that SAGE did. Fantastic product.</li>
    <li> I have problems with oily scalp, dandruff and itchiness. Most shampoo in the market will make the problems worse. This shampoo eliminates the problems and also smell really nice. Finished my first bottle and I&#x27;ll definitely re-order it.</li>
    <li> I have had a dandruff problem for a while, and this shampoo fit my needs! It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, has great ingredients in it and it works well! Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> My daughter has suffered from heavy dandruff for sometime now.  I decided to try the Sage shampoo by a recommendation from a coworker.  We were amazed at the results.  The smell is awesome.  The only shampoo we will ever use.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product from amazin... Used it and I find it very helpfull. I was suffering from extreme dandruff and itchy scalp, but this product have narrowed it down and now i have almost healthy hair... Go for it guys!!!!</li>
    <li> My son has severe dandruff! I have tried Head and Shoulders and other dandruff shampoos,and it makes very little difference. This Sage Shampoo for heavy dandruff has really made a big difference! I am so glad we tried it! I am a perfectionist, and things like flaking dandruff, drive me crazy!Also it has a very pleasant smell as opposed to the awful smelling Neutrogena T/Gel orginal formula he tried! That stuff smelled like tar!!!</li>
    <li> Liked it.  Seemed to sooth the scalp.</li>
    <li> This works. Stops itching, flaking and leaves hair feeling wonderful. This is the only product I have ever found to do what I need. I have even seen dermatologists. Most importantly this product does not dry out hair. It is safe on color treated hair also.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product from last 4 weeks now. My dandruff is reduced and it smells good as well. Its advisable to use atleast once every 3 days. I will show great results.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I saw a difference in my scalp psoriasis in only three uses. I will be using this product from now on!</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo a lot, it has a nice scent to it, and it leaves your hair feeling nice and clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Sage shampoo for a little more than 1.5 months and I am very pleased with it.  The shampoo has greatly reduced any dandruff I&#x27;ve had and completely gotten rid of the occasional flares of scaly, itchy scabs that I&#x27;ve been experiencing on my scalp.  I also enjoy the aroma of the shampoo.  It smells earthy and natural.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently got a Brazilian blowout done and this was one of the only safe products I could use on my hair. It improved my dry scalp immediately.</li>
    <li> So, you know how you use a new shampoo once or twice and get amazing results and then you have to change shampoos to get that pop of a wow from before? Well, I have been using maple holistic&#x27;s shampoo for about three months now and I have only just tried the sage shampoo. I have been using the sage for about two weeks and wow! My hair is so shiny and bouncy, beautiful. The color is brighter and the silver gray in my hair is so vibrant, now that I have decided to stop highlighting my hair. The texture of my gray is not as course where it is growing in at the roots and It is actually quite beautiful. I am a young one to have as much gray as I do but this shampoo (and silk 18 conditioner) has made me feel like my color is superior to anything artificial and I don&#x27;t want want to risk messing up my hair and scalp health by coloring again. How wonderful to experience natural beauty merely by washing my hair!! I can also easily go 4 days without oily build up before the need for another wash. And itchiness is a distant memory!!! You have to try this shampoo...oh! And unlike many companies, there a people behind the brand that care. Customer service and satisfaction are their number one priority. So thankful to have stumbled upon this company!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about 2 and a half weeks now. I think it works really well. At first, I thought it didn&#x27;t lather real good - which I know is no way to determine the effectiveness - but the more I used it, the more it lathered. The lather is so thick now, very, very thick and it&#x27;s wonderful. I think the smell could be better, but many people probably like the sage smell. It doesn&#x27;t smell medicine-ey like a lot of shampoos for dandruff or dry scalp, so that&#x27;s good. And once I dry it, all I smell is my conditioner. I like how thick the formula is, too. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t run out of my hands before I get it to my head. I know it works, my scalp no longer itches all the time and the sore places on the side of my head have all but gone. I must&#x27;ve waited too long to seek treatment, because it did take a few shampooings for me to notice a difference. I&#x27;m sure I wouldn&#x27;t have had that issue had I started using it sooner. Also, I was afraid it would dry my hair out, since as you rinse it out your hair will feel extremely &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; but I have found this to be the opposite! I feel like my hair is much healthier the longer I use this shampoo and my conditioner seems to work better now. My hair feels soft, and is more manageable than it has been in years. I haven&#x27;t had to use my straightener at all!  Bottom line, I really like this shampoo. It&#x27;s not just for dandruff, which I usually don&#x27;t experience. I have itchy scalp, along with those sore, itchy patches that get crusty if you don&#x27;t treat them. I was using Head and Shoulders, but it started making things worse and dried my hair out. This shampoo treats my condition and leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> The only shampoo(aside from t gel) that consistently worked for me was the dark blue bottle of head and shoulders.  This stuff works just as well, if not better than the head and shoulders.  It doesn&#x27;t have that familiar tar or weird shampoo smell either!  Love and plan to buy more of this.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo for dandruff.  Helped me from the first time.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shampoo last winter as the dry air was giving me dandruff. I had wanted to try a sulfate free shampoo for a long time and this shampoo is amazing! It cured my dandruff and it cleaneses the hair thoroughly without stripping all the good oils. It&#x27;s even strong enough to really clean the hair after a good workout, something other sulfate free shampoos aren&#x27;t able to do for me. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This Shampoo eased the constant itch on my scalp and fully conditioned the scaly patches. I will definitely continue to use during the winter months!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t it have the conditioner to this sage shampoo? If not what conditioner can I use? I know tea tree oil is good for dandruff, didn&#x27;t know sage is good for it also, but I have heavy dandruff which I see this shampoo is good for, but the tea tree shampoo is for mild any suggestions? Am looking for a cure am tired of trying so many different products. Please help!!! Black Caribbean Queen.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this shampoo after reading the reviews. Sadly, it did not get even close. I&#x27;ve had dandruff for the past 20 years and this did not make it any better, in fact, it seemed to make it worse. The itching and flaking seemed to worsen after use. I tried using it daily to see if that made a difference, I used it every other day, I used it every other day with another shampoo between, I tried everything. No improvement. Hopefully it works for you.</li>
    <li> I just bought a small bottle of this shampoo because I have moderate dandruff. All other dandruff shampoos have done an alright job at taking care of my dandruff, but this natural shampoo did a great job after just two uses. The more I use it the more I like it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the great reviews, but I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months and it has done nothing for my dandruff. With the product, I there was a card that said if I were to write a positive review, I would receive a free product (which maybe explain so many good reviews). However, the shampoo smelled good.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo as it smells nice, doesn&#x27;t have all the nasty chemicals in it (like my prescription dandruff shampoo that didn&#x27;t work but made my scalp worse), takes away the itch and improves my dandruff.</li>
    <li> The shampoo does well like most scalp dandruff shampoos and has the main ingredient for fighting dryness but the difference between this and other shampoos is the level of hydration and the pleasant smell. I think this shampoo would make a fine alternative to the leading dandruff shampoo brand.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s working better than all the generic anti-dandruff shampoos, including head &amp; shoulders etc.. and even selsun and Nizoral. And without any toxic chemicals.. It&#x27;s a bit expensive but definitely worth it. Will definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> only using this sage shampoo yesterday for first time, I noticed a lot less issues from scalp dryness today, going to use again tonight.. and am expecting good results.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo.  Just a small amount works for my long hair.  Smells like tea tree oil, which is fine because that works good against dandruff.  Works well for me.</li>
    <li> made a real diffrence</li>
    <li> Perfect for my wife&#x27;s fragrance allergy.  Allows her to use dandruff reducing shampoo without harsh ingredients.  She really likes the product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working! My husband has the worst dandruff and we have tried everything to help it abate, except a dermatologist. Every &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34; dandruff shampoo out there smells like tar or medicine, not to mention NONE of them have worked as well as this product. We did not see results on day one, but by day 7, I noticed a definite decrease in shoulder flakes. We are now at the three week mark and his dandruff is just about gone. Nothing else has worked, did I say that? It smells nice, Did I say that? BUY IT! :)</li>
    <li> not sure it really works.  maybe I am not using it enough.  or maybe I need to give it more than a couple months to work.</li>
    <li> I am not satisfied with the result. Although I am using it in proper direction I can see huge amounts of hair loss during application of this product. I am pretty much disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with Dandruff since childhood. You know that scene in Breakfast Club where the chick etches a picture of a house on her black desk and fluffs her hair to sprinkle on &amp;#34;snow&amp;#34;? As a child-young adult, I had enough dandruff issues to do just that. Because of my dandruff issues, my acne never went away. If you aren&#x27;t familiar with this, allow me to explain. There are many ANNOYING factors that cause acne. Bad hygiene, genetics, hormone, stress, and overall health. Although many of these are out of your control, there are things you can do to minimize acne. I&#x27;ve searched everywhere for answers. I&#x27;m taking vitamin supplements, bought tea tree oil, mud masks, scrubs, and moisturizers. However, I started to notice that although my skin was very soft and moist, my acne didn&#x27;t go away. Mainly, the acne on my forehead. Further research and many months of low self esteem later, I came to the conclusion that dandruff was to blame. Clinically speaking, if your acne is more prominent on your forehead, check your shampoo and scalp health.&lt;br /&gt;Well, as it turns out, dandruff does cause acne. It prevents your forehead from sloughing off skin cells. So, I purchased this in the hopes that my final war against acne may take place. Guess what? Dandruff is reduced almost by 70% after the first use. The smell is wonderful. Unlike many guys, I don&#x27;t like smelling like Axe or Old Spice. Sage smells just as good to me. Plus, if you want to attract a potential date, you don&#x27;t want to smell like every other guy. All in all, I&#x27;m happy that I purchased this. It beats Head and Shoulders by a mile. I&#x27;ve used H&amp;S since childhood and my dandruff never stopped.</li>
    <li> This stuff has done some pretty great things for my hair. I have very dry, frizzy hair courtesy of my Jewish heritage and this is the first shampoo that has cut down on both my dandruff and my frizz. I forgo conditioner quite a bit with no ill effects (I do coconut oil masks quite a bit though, which helps A LOT). I was a little put off by the price, but even with thick long hair it has lasted me almost 6 months, that&#x27;s a lot better than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> My son has eczema and his hair flakes terribly especially in the winter.  I have tried the S***** Blue product and it did not work.  It only made his hair flakier.  The shampoo really helped us so much.  I am telling everyone.  After the first use, his flakes were gone.  He still has to wash his hair every other day to keep the flakes away but it is worth every penny.  It works better when you let the shampoo suds sit on your scalp for a few minutes as it is directed on the label.  It has a strong medicine smell, it reminds me of being in a day spa.  Not stinky, just strong (I think it is the tea tree)but it does not linger.  I also bought the conditioner and it has a very pleasant smell.  It suds very well and a little goes a long way.  My son is bi-racial (Classic mixed curly texture) in case any African Americans are looking at this product I think it is safe to say it would work on thicker or coarser hair.  It does make his hair feel a little dry after rinsing but the conditioner takes good care of that.</li>
    <li> I seriously wouldn&#x27;t go back to any other shampoo after trying this one. Although some people might not find the smell very attractive but it washes away. It is very drying though so best if it&#x27;s paired with a rich conditioner.</li>
    <li> This leaves my hair feeling clean without the residue/bulky feeling of other shampoos. I definitely plan to buy more.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo because I&#x27;ve been experiencing a very flaky scalp the past month or two, and I don&#x27;t know whether to attribute it to dryness or dandruff. After five days of using this shampoo daily, I do see a noticeable difference in the condition of my scalp. By the end of the day, I&#x27;m flaky again, but in the morning and during work I don&#x27;t notice any flakes on my shoulders. I think it smells fanstastic. It lathers really well and rinses clean. I bought the Silk 18 conditioner, which seems to work really well with this shampoo and leaves my pixie-length curls soft and not the least bit frizzy.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! After just a week of use my scalp adjusted and was clear! I have been using it for several months now and my scalp seems to have become a little immune because I am getting some flaking once in a while (with 3 days of shampooing in between), but still the best all natural product I have tried.  I will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I felt this one deserved it. I have always had small amounts of dandruff even as a kid. After I had my second child it got a lot worse. Every shampoo I tried, (and I tried over 15 different brands), would either make my hair oily and break me out (I&#x27;m talking massive pimples on my scalp) or would make the dandruff worse. There would be times that I would just get out of the shower and have so many flakes that I couldn&#x27;t even comb them out. My scalp ALWAYS itched no matter how clean I got my hair. Well, after the first use of this shampoo I could already tell a difference. Washing it the first time my hair actually squeaked it was so clean. My scalp didn&#x27;t even itch and I waited 3 days to wash my hair again. Usually after 3 days with other products my hair would be oily and my scalp was beyond itchy. While I can&#x27;t say that this has completely alleviated the dandruff, it HAS greatly reduced it and my scalp no longer itches and I no longer have breakouts. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now and it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works wonderfully! Switched from Head &amp; Shoulders to Sage Shampoo for a sulfate free dandruff shampoo, no complaints!! :)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t make my scalp feel any better, left my hair feeling dry, and generally didn&#x27;t work at all -- even after weeks of use.</li>
    <li> I love that this shampoo is all natural and does not have the awful chemicals used in most other shampoos, yet it still cleans well. Many other “all natural” shampoos do not lather or clean as well. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> I have struggled with dandruff for as long as I can remember. I have found Head and Shoulders use to work the best for me but it seems to have lost its effectiveness lately so I wanted to try something new. I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for about a week now and I can tell a difference in how my hair looks, people have even commented that it looks healthier. I do have to shampoo my hair every day though or I get itchy flaky scalp again, but that is pretty standard for me even with other products that I&#x27;ve tried. I have noticed I am losing less hair in the shower as well which the company says is due to the sage ingredient, so that&#x27;s a plus. It seems to leave my hair a little dry and stiff although even without conditioner, it is pretty detangled. After I blow dry though, my hair goes back to being pretty soft. The dryness could also be due to the colder weather we have been having. I am not completely sold on this product yet but I am going to finish the bottle and see how my dandruff and hair is then. The natural aspect is a plus and I feel pretty fancy when I use it. I&#x27;m not too crazy about the scent but it is not overpowering so I can overlook that. The price is hard for me to swallow but lately I have found the more expensive, natural products actually do work better. Overall, the product does what it says it does which is great! I just wish it eliminated my dandruff for more than 24hrs but maybe there aren&#x27;t any products that do that!</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo for the whole family. My wife loves the scent. I love the invigorating effects and the fact that my dry scalp is getting treated day by day.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this product after reading so many great reviews about it. I recently encountered heavy dandruff issue in my life first time and am glad I chose best product for it. After couple of hair washes, dandruff is completely gone. This is quite early review for this product but I will update after 2-4 weeks.</li>
    <li> Be patient - with longer use, this really works.  Once I started using it twice a day, my dermatitis rapidly subsided.  I&#x27;d much rather use this that the cortisone my doctor recommended!</li>
    <li> Works well on my relaxed African American hair, keeps my dandruff under control with almost no more flaking.  Love how extra soft my hair is now.  Product is rich and lathers very good. Love the scent too.  Yes, will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has virtually eliminated my dandruff problem.  I wear black a great deal, especially in the winter.  It is worth the price to not have dandruff flakes and the itchy scalp that goes with it.  I plan to continue using this shampoo and highly recommend it to anyone who has a heavy dandruff problem.  It works!!!</li>
    <li> I was having a tough time finding a natural, sulfate-free shampoo that actually works for my dry, flaky scalp. This one is IT! It&#x27;s gentle enough on my hair for daily use, smells good, and reduces flakes quickly. It&#x27;s definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> After years and years of trial and error, this seems to be the product for me. My scalp has become very sensitive over the years and now cannot tolerate sulfate shampoos. Most of the OTC shampoos for dandruff contain sulfates. Some of the non-sukfate shampoos worked to reduce irritation but didn&#x27;t treat the dandruff. I stumbled upon this product through google searching and I think it&#x27;s a keeper. Smells delicious, lathers well, treats the dandruff naturally and reduces my scalp irritation. Wish I&#x27;d found this product years ago. Never thought I&#x27;d look forward to a shampoo every day, but now I do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with itchy burning scalp along with the annoying dandruff that goes along it it. I&#x27;ve tried many many different products from head and shoulders to oil treatments this product is my go to shampoo now.  After only a few uses I could tell a difference no itching less flakes.  I was thrilled! Finally something that works.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s been at their wits end and tired of buy expensive products that don&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> As far as effectiveness goes, this shampoo is awesome!  I have uber sensitive skin, and this does not make me itch....so yay!  However, it smells like icy hot mixed with ant poison.  Seriously.  I cringed the first time I opened the bottle.  But, like I said, it works.  Guess you have to pick your battles.</li>
    <li> FINALLY - A SHAMPOO THAT IS ACTUALLY HELPING CLEAR UP MY SCALP PSORIASIS.  LESS ITCHING.</li>
    <li> awesome product if you having lots of issues with dandruff I have one happy family after using this product, delivery was amazingly fast thanks.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff!!!</li>
    <li> OI really like it. It did a good job solving my dry and flaky scalp issues and I can also notice that my hair is now bouncier and shinier than ever. I also like the smell, by the way. It&#x27;s not strong like other anti dandruff shampoos. Instead it&#x27;s sweet and fragrant and the smell last the whole day.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS AMAZING. I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING FOR YEARS, INCLUDING RX PRODUCTS. NOTHING WORKS LIKE THIS. NO STRONG CHEMICALS- PURE NATURE. NO REACTION TO SENSITIVE SKIN. NO MORE ITCHY SCALP. GETS RID OF GROSS DEAD SKIN ON SCALP. I AM HAPPY AGAIN. CAN&#x27;T WAIT TO TRY ALL YOUR PRODUCTS. THANKS SO MUCH. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!! Before this,I&#x27;ve been itching my head for what seems forever. It really does wonders with the stupid dandruff!!</li>
    <li> I suffer from dandruff and thought I would try this new product and it works great. First time I tried it I was sold. Thanks for the great experience.</li>
    <li> My ill sis Carey sent this to my daughter she has thick fine hair i dint know where she glad to know now I have tried everything for kellley and nothing was working head and shoulders dg. Brand oil washing often not washing often still nothing worked this stopped her from itching the most</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for two months now and it still works. I had severe dandruff and itchy scalp. If I skip using it my scalp starts itching again so I use this as my only shampoo now. I&#x27;m not so concerned with the all natural aspect of it. I just wanted something that works and it seems I have found it finally.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo in the world . First wash my all problem is gone</li>
    <li> the girl that cuts my hair says my scalp never looked better and that my hair was very soft and managable</li>
    <li> I enjoy the herbal scent but unfortunately the product doesn&#x27;t work for my issue.</li>
    <li> Every winter I find myself constantly scratching at my scalp which is of course followed by the white flakes on my shoulders (bleh).  I have tried head and shoulders, but I really don&#x27;t like all the chemicals in my hair.  My mom recently told me about this product so I decided to give it a try.  So far its been great!  I haven&#x27;t been itching as much and the flakeyness is starting to subside.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other stuff and nothing really worked. Some felt like it was slightly working but never got rid of my problems. Sage showed improvements after only 2 days and after 1 week i can honestly say that my problem almost completely gone. I had heavy dandruff and itching. I expect it to be all gone in less than a week.</li>
    <li> I really like this product it is the only thing I have found to work.  I&#x27;ve tried many anti-dandruff products and was very grateful to finally find one that works. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I am 43 and never had problems with my scalp until about 2 years ago.  I am contributing it to hormonal changes in my body.  After being told by my dermatologist that I had dandruff I tried the shampoo she recommended which just caused my scalp to become very irritated and itchy.  I tried several different brands over the next few months.  Some were not as irritating as others, but none were really helping with the itch.  Not to mention I was having to wash it everyday just to keep it under control.  My hair is thick and long and the time I was having to spend styling it was just too much.  So I began my research....and to maybe save you some time, I will tell you what worked for me.  I wash my hair in warm (not hot) water, being sure to gently massage it into the scalp and let it sit for a couple of minutes.  Rinse and repeat.  It doesn&#x27;t take much, so the bottle goes a long way....and I have long, thick hair.  Next, I condition with their Silk 18 condiioner.  I am careful to keep the conditioner only on my hair to keep contact with the scalp minimal.  I let it sit for a couple of minutes and rinse...finishing with a cold water rinse to close the cuticles.  Blow dry with cold air only.  If I dont have time to completely blow dry, I at least dry the hair closest to the scalp, so moisture doesnt sit there.  I just recently began using the Silk 18 conditioner because I figured out if I used any conditioner at all it was making the back of my head feel greasy after one day.  So I just wasnt using anything which made drying and styling my hair very difficult, not to mention my stylist said I was stripping all the color right out of my hair. I tried the conditioner and detangler my stylist told me was top of the line and had no chemicals first.  The itching came right back, so I decided to try the MH Silk 18 conditioner.  Now I only have to wash my hair every 2--3 days.  Bottom line, I think all the chemicals in the other products were making my scalp irritated and itchy.  I am so happy I found this product and will probably try some of their other products as well..  I am so happy I found this product and will probably try some of their other products as well.</li>
    <li> Cleans scalp,very good</li>
    <li> THis Product is Awesome! It worked very well and fast too!</li>
    <li> Between my thick, curly, frizzy hair and the fact that I&#x27;m allergic to everything [including the sun], I was so happy that this worked for me. I only have to use it once a week, and it keeps my scalp from becoming itchy.</li>
    <li> He just tried it yesterday &amp; couldn&#x27;t believe it. After one wash, pretty much everything was gone. And his hair wasn&#x27;t dry at all. Clean &amp; soft... Happy!!!</li>
    <li> Love, love this shampoo. My hair feels so soft but most importantly, dandruff free! I wish they had a conditioner that went with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have tried for YEARS to find something to help my seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp - Head n Shoulders, T-gel, Selson Blue, Garnier Dandruff control, several organic brands...  I&#x27;ve even tried prescription stuff.  This works!  It really works!  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, so I will continue looking for an alternative, but I will keep this on hand in case the alternatives don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Good product, it smells delicious and I remove dandruff from my scalp, I really liked this product and I was very satisfied, I recommend, thanks so much.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how well it worked. I have been using regular dandruff shampoos for years with minimal results, but after just a couple of uses, I never saw another flake. Plus it smells great and isn&#x27;t harsh so it&#x27;s usable every day. Would recommend to anyone with stubborn dandruff.</li>
    <li> I have always had trouble with dry scalp.  I&#x27;ve tried prescription ointments even and they didn&#x27;t work as well as this Sage Shampoo!  I would recommend to anyone and everyone!!!</li>
    <li> I have horrible dandruff and the difference since using this shampoo is amazing. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> First shampoo that actually helps with dandruff!! It does dry my hair out though.</li>
    <li> Daughter has such bad dandruff even prescriptions dint help, this stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my boyfriend because he has psoriasis on his scalp. It didn&#x27;t help much and in fact it dried out his scalp more. It might just be for his case but this definitely didn&#x27;t help him.</li>
    <li> Smells like HEAVEN! And it works</li>
    <li> My 19 year old daughter has suffered with itchy scalp and dandruff for years.  We have tried every over the counter dandruff shampoo and even a couple of prescription shampoos to no avail.  Some helped with the dandruff, but not the itchy scalp.  During a web search for remedies, I ran across an add for the Sage Shampoo.  We ordered it and after about 1 week my daughter&#x27;s itchy scalp problem was gone!  After two weeks of use her dandruff problem was also solved.  Love this stuff!  Thanks Maple Holistics!</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo for itchy scalp I&#x27;ve ever tried!!</li>
    <li> this product worked on controlling dandruff, but my hair lacked shine and felt dirty.&lt;br /&gt;wish there was a supporting conditioner.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my husband. He has severe dandruff and skin problems. He started to use it last Thursday and we already can see some improvement and less dandruff. We will see in a few weeks and update our review.</li>
    <li> Use to have very bad dandruff and eczema after a few weeks of using this product both are gone</li>
    <li> I am in my early fifties and have had dry, itchy scalp issues most of my life. I have tried many things over the years with limited success so I was naturally skeptical. After reading many reviews, I decided to give this a try. I&#x27;m grateful I did. The first time I used it I did not use a conditioner as I wanted to know exact results for this product only. I have fairly fine, straight hair with some wave to it, but it is very long. I personally recommend some sort of conditioner as combing out was a challenge. The good news is I went from a &amp;#34;dusting of snow&amp;#34; on my shoulders every time I brushed my hair to less than half a dozen flakes after first use. Since then, nothing. Not only that, my scalp feels better and my hair even looks healthier. Although this product initially struck me as expensive, I now see I have not been saving money by buying cheaper products that don&#x27;t work. I have been throwing money away. In short, a great investment.</li>
    <li> Noticed a difference in dry scalp after the first use! I have tried a lot of the bigger brand equivalents, but none work as well as Maple Holistics. Reduces dry scalp about 90% and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, definitely worth the higher price.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted me to find an all natural shampoo to use to replace the chemical shampoo I usually use. So far, so good! It smells great and seems to be working!</li>
    <li> So far (two uses) it&#x27;s working very much the same as every other anti-dandruff shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried. I wouldn&#x27;t say it smells amazing, but it&#x27;s definitely better than what you get for other high quality powerful shampoos of this type. It smells and feels somewhat minty, which is very refreshing. My expectations have not yet been met, but it is definitely too early to tell. If anything changes I will make sure to update...  UPDATE: After two months of use it began to work. Dandruff is gone, but it is my no means a miracle cure. My head still feels a little itchy at times and it dries out my hair a tiny bit. I complement it with a great conditioner (Deva Curl) and that seems to balance it out. I purchased second bottle, so I believe in it!</li>
    <li> So far i am not too happy with this product. I like the fact that it is paraben free and has a great blend of ingredients but it has not cured my dandruff problem. I will continue to give the product a shot and hopefully it will start to work.</li>
    <li> sage shampoo great stuff</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work but smells nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo for my husband who had severe dandruff. One month later I&#x27;m amazed at its results!! Seriously, I mean it. In the past I tried buying so many products and none has been this satisfying. Thanks Sage.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It worked so well on my hair in just once use! I highly, highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;It did make my hair feel a tad bit dry so it&#x27;s good to use a conditioner that helps to soften hair. I followed it up with Biosilk conditioner. They are a great combo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend everyone to purchase this!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many shampoos! Including rx shampoos from my Dermatologist. None have helped me. I know my issue is from to much fungus as I have a Candida issue. I also have a bad thyroid. Candida and hypo thyroid can cause itchy scalp and dandruff. Which is why most haven&#x27;t helped. This shampoos is so soothing! It really helps with th itch! As I am not itching so much the dandruff is better. I am very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> My hair still have as much dandruff as it did before this shampoo. It did absolutely nothing for my scalp unfortunately.</li>
    <li> The shampoo really helped my dandruff. Not sure on how it will evolve in the long term (have it for two weeks and saw a big improvement for now). But definitely worth a try for every person that has dandruff!</li>
    <li> I have suffered with eczema around my ears and on my scalp for 20+ years.  I used a prescription cream for a long time until I learned that the cream was issued a black box warning stating that it was linked to cancer.  I was then on a mission to treat my eczema with a non-prescription product and I tried many (traditional dandruff shampoos, tea tree oil products, oatmeal products, drug store creams, expensive creams, homeopathic remedies...).  If you can think of it I probably tried it.  None of the treatments worked, and most of them made my issue worse. As a last attempt I saw this product on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  This shampoo has been a miracle for me.  What was once scaly, red, cracking skin is now &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin. As a bonus this shampoo also makes my hair look great. I can not thank Maple Holistics enough.</li>
    <li> I discovered this by accident. I bought it for my husband who gets dandruff. I was out of my shampoo so I used his. I have fine  hair that you basically have to wash everyday because it gets visibly oily at the roots  literally the next day after I wash my hair (a big drag as I&#x27;m sure you fellow oily heads know, lol). I noticed that my hair wasn&#x27;t as oily between washings with this shampoo. I could actually go every other day and it would look pretty good. It also made my hair soft. I try to buy natural shampoo without a lot of the bad stuff in it but unfortunately most of the time they just don&#x27;t work with my hair. This does, so I was really happy about that (also make sure to only condition the ends of your hair. I&#x27;m still searching for a good conditioner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I recently started doing to help stretch the days between washing my hair is get a good dry shampoo.  I have tried a few on Amazon. Again, I want to limit the chemicals I am exposing myself to. Dry shampoos seem to have a lot of them unfortunately.  I really like Giovanni Powder Power Dry Shampoo that I found on Amazon and it seems to have less chemicals than a lot of them (especially the aerosol ones). This one volumizes too. So between those two things I&#x27;m pretty happy with my hair now. Just thought I&#x27;d share this too because it took me a long time to figure out how to effectively handle my oily hair.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me, but I do like the smell a lot.</li>
    <li> My husband has a problem with bad dandruff as well as his face just making scaly dandruff like scales.  He&#x27;s used this product for about a week now and I can already notice the difference.  I can notice less scales on his dark shirts.  He can actually wear Black and dark colors again.  This product has a very strong smell, but it works well.  This product is really awesome.  If you have dandruff, this is a great product for you.</li>
    <li> Since using it, it&#x27;s only made my dandruff WORSE. My entire head is constantly itchy now and there&#x27;s even more build up. Never using again.</li>
    <li> I waited a month to write this review but really love it. I received this as a christmas gift and will be buying again. great product, great smell. overall awesome!</li>
    <li> Hubby didn&#x27;t like this product at all. He says it didn&#x27;t help with the dandruff and he couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
    <li> I have just been using this for 2 months and I already know that I&#x27;m sticking with it. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who has struggled with dandruff for quite some time. I was so sick of seeing flakes everywhere, so I decided to try this product after reading great reviews. To our amazement, after only the second use, the flakes were almost gone! Now, after the fourth use, the flakes are gone completely! Fantastic product! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Very effective! In just one use my itchy dandruff is gone. Smell is pleasant and doesnt really linger so it should be fine. Hair becomes shiny and feels stronger. The only caveat is the price tag of only 8 oz - its small amount for everyday use,  I wish it comes in a big bottle so one can save some bucks than purchasing a small bottle every couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Not working for me :-/</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these product.  They smell amazing. Definately a keeper.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I was skeptical about this product given my long standing dandruff issues and poor experiences with other anti-dandruff hair care products.  So I&#x27;ve learned there are two kinds of dandruff: small, fine flakes from dry scalp and oily larger scaly flakes from fungal dandruff.  I struggle with both issues as most people with dandruff do.  I&#x27;ve read that its a problem of most sulfate based products overdrying your scalp, causing small flakes, then our scalp overcompensates and overproduces oil feeding the fungal dandruff.  I&#x27;ve tried many scalp moisturizing shampoos, leave in treatments for the dry flakes and also many an antifungal sulfide based shampoos to try to combat this issue.  I honestly hate most shampoos marketed as anti-dandruff shampoo because they leave my scalp feeling even more dry and unbearable than before using them.  Be that as it may, I was willing to give the Sage shampoo a shot since I was getting a sample and it is also sulfate/paraben free. The first thing I noticed after applying this product on my hair for the first time was there was none of that unpleasant medicated dandruff shampoo scent that most antidandruff shampoos come with.  It had a nice sage scent that was fragrant but not overpowering.  It also lathered up nicely for a sulfate free product.  After drying, I noticed that it did not leave my scalp feeling as dry other anti-dandruff shampoos do.  I&#x27;ve used this product a few times now and while I have not noticed any scaly fungaly flakes I still have some small flakes from my scalp still being a little dry (it&#x27;s also the dead of winter right now for me).  I  think this shampoo did a nice job considering.  I know the dry flakes will have to be combatted with a more hydrating shampoo and I&#x27;m considering trying out their hydrate shampoo and alternating between the two.  A nice bonus of this shampoo I&#x27;ve also noticed is that it leaves my hair feeling very clean and light which I have quite enjoyed.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with dandruff issues looking for an alternative shampoo without all the usual harsh ingredients. 4.5 stars!</li>
    <li> Love the smell cleans my hair but the itchy flaky is still there.  Disappointing after all the reviews I read</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. I do not have dandruff but I do have curly hair and need a shampoo that will remove styling product residue but is gentle. This is the third different shampoo that I have tried from Maple Holistics and I love them all. I like the smell of this shampoo, it cleans well and does not dry my hair out. Since I first tried this brand I have had no intentions of switching which says a lot for me. It really is that good and not full of the junk you find in almost all other hair care lines. The other lines that do not contain the junk do not hold a candle to Maple Holistics products and their effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Maple Holistics has great customer service. I really feel that they are all about their customers and our satisfaction.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far but I really enjoyed it and intend to continue using it. I have very dry curly hair so I have to be picky about hair products. I also have an itchy scalp and there aren&#x27;t many sulfate-free options out there that help treat itchy scalp/dandruff. I happened to stumble across this item, and I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;It smells wonderful, not medicinal at all like OTC dandruff shampoos do. It also feel really nice on the scalp...tingly without stinging. It didn&#x27;t leave my hair super dry, though I did follow it up with their Silk10 Conditioner. It won&#x27;t be my regular, go-to shampoo, but it will definitely be a once-a-week scalp treatment.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with scalp problems for years and found the Sage shampoo to be perfect for controlling these issues.  As an added bonus, it has seemed to help immensely with shedding which has decreased dramatically.  When I have run out, and used other products, I always come back to purchasing more Sage!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. It is great for relieving itchiness and flaking immediately. To clear up symptoms I had to use for a few weeks. The only downside is the price. It smells great as opposed to other natural dandruff shampoos which contain sulfur.</li>
    <li> This product has already paid for itself in just a week coz I&#x27;ve noticed results in a week and I still have an almost full bottle. A little goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t require you to use a conditioner after. It already leaves your hair smooth and bouncy as is while still fighting dandruf.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!! It is the only product I&#x27;ve found that has improved the health of my scalp without any nasty chemicals. I highly recommend this if you, like me, are trying to rid toxins and chemicals from your beauty routine. I use this with their Silk 18 conditioner and the results have been awesome- healthy scalp and shiny hair.  Planning on repurchasing for sure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week or so and it&#x27;s starting to show improvement. I will keep using it until all dandruff is gone, I hope! Very good nonprescription shampoo that works.</li>
    <li> It is the best shampoo for dandruff and  itchy scalp. Finally after trying so may I got this and I am glad I bought it.I could see the results in my second hair bath.  Love its fragrance and the quantity I use is hardly 1/2 tspn and It does wonders !!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking over the last several years for a shampoo that I&#x27;m not allergic to.  I&#x27;m allergic to preservatives and certain chemicals).  I&#x27;ve tried Wen, &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products, non-sudsing shampoo, and bar soaps for hair.  They all left my hair either greasy, weighed down, or dull; or my scalp was allergic to them (itchy bumps, even cystic acne like bumps on my scalp, which I&#x27;ve never had cystic acne before).  Finally I&#x27;ve found a shampoo that works!  I have long, fine hair and lots of it.  Normally I wash my hair everyday due to greasy scalp, but now I can go every other day if I want.  This shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out when I wash it every day and it makes my scalp feel wonderful.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 months now.  I do have to use conditioner otherwise I get tangles.  I use Maple Holistics Silk 18.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and makes it feel very soft.</li>
    <li> When you have dandruff an don&#x27;t notice it right away, it can seem to get out of hand real quick. But thanks to this shampoo along with my conditioner I&#x27;ve been able to eliminate the problem right at the source. An have kept it that way since, just using it like my original I&#x27;ve been able to keep my hair a lot healthier then usual.</li>
    <li> It works. I&#x27;ve tried many shampoo that seems to work for a little while. Finally, there is one shampoo does the job as it claimed. It takes care of itchy flaky scalps and adds life to my fine hair.&lt;br /&gt; I strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month know. I noticed that my scalp was not flaky anymore but there&#x27;s still a little bit of dandruff. Hopefully  after I get another one it&#x27;ll be all gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my sister started using it too (used my bottle)&lt;br /&gt;makes hair tough&lt;br /&gt;expensive</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for 3months and it works good... If you are looking for a shampoo that has a good ingredients then this one is the right for you.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo worked well against dandruff and didn&#x27;t sting my scalp like other dandruff shampoos. I also have had a problem with my scalp itching after I used non-organic shampoos, but I didn&#x27;t have any problem after using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells nice and really works.</li>
    <li> Best dandruff shampoo that there is.  My scalp has never felt better.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! I&#x27;ve struggled with finding something that clears up the dandruff for years and this stuff took care of it in just 1 wash! I think the key is to let it sit on your scalp for 2-3 minutes each time you wash your hair. My only complaint is that it smells a little bit like Vicks Vaporub.. That being said, I will definitely buy it again when this bottle is gone!</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my scalp. My scalp is still very itchy and flakey. With all the great reviews and the price of the product, I was excited to finally find something great that would work for me....but no... two stars because it does smell good and doesnt tangle up my hair really bad.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does a very good job taking care of my dandruff and leaving my hair smooth and feeling clean all day. I have been using it for 3 months and I definitely have no doubts about it.</li>
    <li> For a while, I&#x27;ve been using natural shampoos my mom bought for me. No matter how hard I lathered and rinsed and how many times I did it, my head itched like crazy even right after the shower. My mom decided to buy this shampoo to try out. After the first wash, I was surprised that my head didn&#x27;t itch like it had before. The shampoo worked - and after only one time! It&#x27;s definitely worth everything it costs and then some. I use more than a quarter amount (about double the amount) but I only wash my hair once. The shampoo&#x27;s effects last about 2 days after which you have to wash your hair again (my hair is short, so longer hair would likely get dirty quicker). Overall, this is even better than was expected of it.</li>
    <li> A little drying on the hair, but use a deep conditioner afterwards. Use with the scalp master and it works to control even the most severe dandruff. Smell is tolerable. I use it weekly and it has helped to control the dandruff and the scalp it. Going to purchase another one.</li>
    <li> I have dealt with having extreme eczema since a young child. In search of something that might help my scalp, which was extremely affected by the eczema, I came across Maple Holistic&#x27;s Sage Shampoo on Amazon. After reading the reviews left by other customers, I decided to try this shampoo and I am really glad I did. This shampoo feels very soothing to my scalp and I have seen significant improvement in my scalp since I began using this product. I have also been using the Maple Holistics Silk Conditioner, which leaves my hair very easy to comb out after shampooing.  I am very pleased with both of these products and will continue to use them.  Additionally, I must mention that before I began using these products, I would see an extreme amount of hair being left in the drain screen of the shower. After using these products for several months now, I have seen this hair loss to decrease dramatically.  I highly recommend these products and am looking forward to trying others in the future. ~Kathryn :-)</li>
    <li> This product has a strange smell and does not work as well as other things I have tried.  Not reccomended, try something else.</li>
    <li> Although I don&#x27;t have a dandruff problem, I like that it&#x27;s sulfate free and contains natural herbs.</li>
    <li> This was not good stuff....Based on the reviews I was really hoping that this would work for my dandruff but all it did was dry out my hair..Even my attempts to just put it on my scalp made my hair very dry.  It might be okay if you have short hair and you cut your hair a lot but this did not alleviate the itch or the flakes</li>
    <li> I have dry, itchy, flaky scalp in the winter months. I love how this shampoo has remedied this. I love that it is all natural and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out. And the scent is pleasant. Great product!</li>
    <li> So far the only thing that worked for my dry scalp.</li>
    <li> I switched from using an effective dandruff shampoo with sulfates to this hoping this sulfate free shampoo would be just as effective in eliminating dandruff. Unfortunately, I went from a clear scalp to a flaky one in a matter of days. Maybe if dry scalp is your problem this will help but for more serious dandruff sufferers don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. My scalp has improved a lot after using it and the irritation level has gone down. The only con is that the dandruff flakes return the moment you stop using it. I&#x27;m ordering my next bottle and would recommend it to others who&#x27;ve tried other products and failed.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo!! It&#x27;s natural and does exactly what it says it will do...stops dandruff!! I never knew that just using a basic shampoo was not treating the problem (scalp fungus); it was just keeping it at bay. Maple Holistics Sage Shampoo is now my go-to shampoo!!</li>
    <li> I used the Sage shampoo on the recommendation of my wife who uses other products of Maple Holistics. She loves these products and asked me to give it a try.I have had severe recurring dandruff,and hair loss due to which hair fall was uncontrollable.Have tried the other on counter dandruff shampoos but the alcohol content in it just damaged and worsened the hair loss.After trying the sage shampoo I felt a great relief from the dandruff after the first use.It had gone to a great extent.After a few more uses my scalp actually felt good.Have been using it for two or three weeks now and the recurrence rate has decreased, so has the inflammation that  I used to have.All in all I feel good about this because it is totally natural. Also the  jojoba oil and the other ingredients in this shampoo don&#x27;t dry my hair which most of the OTC dandruff shampoo&#x27;s with chemical content tend to do.The shampoo used in combination with the silk 18 conditioner leaves my hair feeling smooth,clean, and smelling good.</li>
    <li> this shampoo gave an ok effect really was not that impressed with the quality of it</li>
    <li> Dandruff improved, but it made my hair very dry.</li>
    <li> Not working for me. Still have lots of dandruff :( But I like the smell</li>
    <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a good product. It smells really good, although I can see how some people may not like it, it&#x27;s really herbal and earthy. It lathers great and you only need a little, so a bottle will last a while. It doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of dandruff if I don&#x27;t use it for a while, but it always gets rid of itchiness and flaking. When I use it more often though (ever 2 or 3 days) it works great. I like this better than T-gel and other dandruff shampoos because it&#x27;s sulfate free and is gentler on my hair.</li>
    <li> I joined an outreach program in a very remote area about almost 1.5 years ago and for some reason, I accumulated dandruff from that 3-month event. I was so disgusted with myself. I almost always wear dark colored shirts and sometimes, suits, and my dandruff look so disgusting. I mean, see the color contrast, see the picture, right? I have tried Nizoral and Head &amp; Shoulders and thought they would work because the smell and the feel on the scalp is a bit too strong. I was wrong. I was so worried I might have scalp dermatitis and really asked people I know on how to treat this. A dear friend suggested this shampoo and it worked. It&#x27;s the only thing that worked for me, actually.</li>
    <li> This shampoo didn&#x27;t work! I&#x27;ve been using for 2 months with no results. Still suffering with dandruff.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really great! I have really sensitive skin and real scalp problems. Nice fragrance...nice not to have to smell like tar! Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews after only using something twice but...my dandruff is completely gone. I was pulling a Breakfast Club two days ago and now I&#x27;m flake free. I also only wash my hair every other day and my second day after using this shampoo looked like I had just washed it that morning. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Excellent for psoriasis dandruff. Found a great difference in my son scalp</li>
    <li> loved it. I have a dandruff problem for a long time. This has help me a lot. my dandruff has almost disappeared.</li>
    <li> its smells interesting, but it hasn&#x27;t even  touched my heavy dandruff problem or the itch-----but still have another bottle to use--maybe it will kick in soon.</li>
    <li> Used it twice and all my dry scalp seems to be gone, no more flaking and itching. Will continue to use it also because it is sulfate free. So far so good!</li>
    <li> This really works. I&#x27;ve used every shampoo and nothing seemed to work. After two uses there was no more flakes and itchy scalp! My hair feels silky and looks shiny. Def recommend this to anyone who suffers from dandruff. Five stars!</li>
    <li> My Daughter and husband both have Seborrheic Dermatitis and consequentially one of the symptoms of this condition is severely dry scalp that scales and crusts (on occasion) we purchased hti shopping to alleviate some of the itchiness, Unfortunately (for them) this pros\dcut did NOT work.For other conditions it might work well but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work for Seb Derm.</li>
    <li> So sad - More hairfall...</li>
    <li> Fantastic shampoo for the whole family.</li>
    <li> First dandruff shampoo I have used that works. I needed the scalp brush to help break down chemical and other build up so the shampoo can actually treat the scalp. After a few applications I noticed a big difference. All natural as well which is awesome.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used, leaves my hair soft and healthy. I recommend this product</li>
    <li> Would highly recommend this product for dandruff - all natural and it takes care of my heavy dandruff . I use them 2 times a week and is much better then prescription strength dandruff shampoos</li>
    <li> This shampoo has pretty much gotten my scalp cleared up, which many other dandruff shampoos failed to do.  I felt changes and saw improvement quickly but it has taken about 4 months of regular use to really get it to the point where I can say it&#x27;s no longer an issue.  Love that it&#x27;s a natural solution.</li>
    <li> My hair is incredibly challenging. I have very long, very thick hair, which makes it incredibly difficult to get all of my shampoo/conditioner out of my hair when I wash it. To compound the situation further, my scalp tends to be dry and flakey... so it&#x27;s really easy for my hair to look oily with a bunch of dandruff. Super sexy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried all kinds of shampoos and conditioner combos to remedy this problem. I&#x27;ve even went the baking soda and apple cider vinegar route trying to get my hair balanced again. Nothing worked as well as this shampoo has for me. I can&#x27;t even describe the joy I had after washing my hair the first time with this shampoo. It felt CLEAN and SOFT and my scalp was much less prone to dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product pretty regularly for a few weeks now and it&#x27;s still doing a great job. Would recommend to anyone with a hair type similar to mine.</li>
    <li> works well but ones it&#x27;s done the dandruff comes back so you have to keep using it.</li>
    <li> The product worked as described and left my hair fuller and softer with less flakes. It also soothed my scalp and stopped the uncomfortable itching feeling that I get during the colder months. I am really happy with this product and I will buy it again. I strongly recommend it to those of you who suffer from a dry itch scalp and don&#x27;t want to use other shampoos that have harsh chemicals in them.</li>
    <li> This works for what it is intended for but stinks like moldy plant life. I used the whole bottle but I won&#x27;t buy it again. I just don&#x27;t like the smell. My hair is long and is often swept in my face. I could take it I suppose if it smelled like fresh cut grass or a forest. But that dusky, moldy smell. Yuck</li>
    <li> i didnt care for it. it didnt work for me.</li>
    <li> I had dandruff...and it really didn&#x27;t seem to do much for me.</li>
    <li> i bought this shampoo for my daughter who suffers from severe dandruff and eczema. after trying other dandruff shampoos that either irritated her skin, had way too many chemicals or left her hair heavy and oily. this shampoo has helped get rid of her dandruff, does not irritate her skin as it is washed away and leaves her hair looking soft not oily. i will be buying this shampoo from now on for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps.&lt;br /&gt;her her type is normal, straight and long, almost to her waist (so even using a little amount goes a long way!)</li>
    <li> Not great! Didn&#x27;t help at all, and it dries your hair really bad?</li>
    <li> really helpful product , use it for 3 month already ,and defenetly will by again</li>
    <li> This shampoo works well and smells great!  I am super impressed with Maple Holistics&#x27; customer service.  I purchased an item from them previously and wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied.  They refunded my money, suggested a product they felt I would be happier with and sent a couple samples of the product so I could test it out.  Great product and a great company!</li>
    <li> I liked this product.  It smelled nice:  The sage scent was a welcome change from the floral scents that usually come in women&#x27;s shampoos or the chemical smells from most dandruff shampoos.  It had a nice amount of lather and left my hair clean without feeling stripped. I didn&#x27;t have to use a large amount of the product, which was important because it is more expensive than other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo worked well against dandruff and didn&#x27;t sting my scalp like other dandruff shampoos.  I also have had a problem with my scalp itching after I used non-organic shampoos, but I didn&#x27;t have any problem after using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I have bad dandruff and really seems to help.</li>
    <li> I like the scent. My dandruff is better but still having issues and flakes are not gone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a while and it hasn&#x27;t really helped. I was hoping it would but no such luck. I like the scent though.</li>
    <li> So far, it&#x27;s the most gentle yet most effective anti-dandruff shampoo I have ever used. It&#x27;s at the same price point but surely does the job better at lessening my visible flakes and removing the itchiness completely. The nice smell is a great bonus!!! :)</li>
    <li> I have always had issues with my scalp.(for years) and always looking for shampoos that will help.(few do even make a difference) Just recently I tried a new one. Sage Shampoo for heavy dandruff with Argan. Jojoba and organic Spikenard..100 percent natural.  so far have tried it twice. I really have been pleased with the results. my hair seems fuller and softer. the scent is pleasing. Highly pleased with it I am. Truly appreciate the brand that created it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shampoo because it contains ingredients to stop dandruff and also to stimulate hair growth.  I read a review that says it doesn&#x27;t lather up but that is not my experience.  It was very rich and foamy, with the usual amount of shampoo, about a dime size dollop. I actually love the texture of my hair after using this product.  My hair is usually fine and lacks body but with this shampoo it had more body than I have had with any other shampoo.  My hair felt thicker and much fuller.  I like that it is natural and organic. I didn&#x27;t have a big dandruff problem but now I don&#x27;t have any dandruff problem.  This shampoo works very well for me.  The company has good and friendly customer service.</li>
    <li> This plesant, herb scented shampoo leaves my hair shiny, smooth and beautiful.  It keeps my fly aways and broken split ends in check.</li>
    <li> This product is great! My itchy scalp and occasional dandruff is gone completely. I feel like it has really balanced my scalp back to normal again. It&#x27;s been difficult  finding a product that actually works and this certainly does! I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing! My husband suffered from a very very dry and itchy scalp, we tried so many natural things to help alleviate his discomfort. Finally, after trying so many things I went online to research a non toxic shampoo that would help him. I stumbled upon Maple Holistics Sage shampoo and bought it, after he used it one time his scalp was better! It was amazing, we love this shampoo! We&#x27;ve been using it for 6+ months now and his scalp still feels and looks great!</li>
    <li> I had a serious dandruff problem all over my hair. Every 4 days after i washed my hair, it was back. A friend of mine who uses the product recommended it to my and I bought it to try it. It is very effective. After 4 times washing my hair with it, I started to see the results of the product. This is now my second time buying it and I´ll keep buying it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this shampoo! I have very sensitive skin/scalp. My scalp gets pretty scaly and dandruffy if I use the wrong product, and my scalp will get so itchy that I scratch it raw. I have noticed that while using this shampoo, my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch at all! Also, it lathers very nicely as compared to other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not the greatest, but it isn&#x27;t horrible. I also use their Silk 18 conditioner after and it smells like coco butter and is great!</li>
    <li> I loved the service! Customer service followed up with me as soon as I started using the product.. so nice and thoughtful!</li>
    <li> I emailed Maple Holistics and asked for a free sample of this product. That is a plus in my book when a company will let you try their product before you buy it. I&#x27;ve been using the free sample (which was a generous amount) for a few days now. I have to say I like it a lot. It really does work well on my dandruff, the only thing I don&#x27;t like about this shampoo is that it leaves my hair a little dry and causes some tangles. But I expect the dray part since most dandruff shampoos do dry out your hair. But all in all it works really well and will be buying another bottle once the free sample runs out.</li>
    <li> it did not help my dandruff at all, in fact it made it worse, it was probably all the oils the ingredients has, it has a strong smell and it does not help dandruff it created more</li>
    <li> I love the way It makes my hair feel!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having some awful dandruff for a while, that even gets into my eyelashes, and I was looking for a good shampoo option that could help me control it somehow. I then came to Amazon and found this sulfate free product with natural ingredients and I thought to give it a try. After the first wash I noticed the difference right away and I felt my scalp cleaner and fresh.  I can&#x27;t say that the smell is the best but when combining the shampoo with the Silk18 Conditioner which has a sweet fragrance, it makes it a great combination.</li>
    <li> This little bottle of magic.I waited for satisfying results before I posted this review.I must say am impressed with this product.With every single wash you can actually feel your getting better.It makes it less oily an more fresh.After using this shampoo and after many weeks I felt my hair so fresh and healthy.You can actually feel the freshness on the scalp and your hair looks so shiny and clean.Every since using this shampoo my dandruff has decreased immensely and the hair fall has nearly stopped.I feel so confident about my hair now and I am so happy that I made the right decision by choosing this Sage Shampoo.</li>
    <li> I was like so many others who suffer from really bad dandruff and couldn&#x27;t find anything that worked. From chemical shampoos to organic apple cider vinegar, believe me I have tried it all. I decided to give this a go in August of 2014. It took about a month of using this product consistently and really following the directions. (Washing your hair twice every shower, letting it sit on the scalp for at least 5 minutes and then repeating, as well as a cool water final rinse before being done). The cool water rinse is really important. I have noticed that my head gets itchy and dry when I just wash in hot water. It&#x27;s not that you can&#x27;t have a hot shower just rinse your head in cool/cold right before you get out to close the hair follicle. I started noticing a big difference after just the first few washes however it took about a full month or longer for the dandruff to go away completely.  Its now March 2015 and I&#x27;m on my 4th bottle and flake free. It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I have suffered with seboric dermatitis dice I was16 and I am now 30. I deal with flakes everywhere and severe itchiness. I have tried all types of shampoos and nothing worked for me. I was on Amazon searching for new remedies that would help my condition and I came upon this product. I decided to try it and I am very happy did. It has reduced my flakes tremendously in the 3 times I have used it. I am excited to the progress my hair will see with continued use.i still have a little itching but I can deal with that.</li>
    <li> I suffered from seborrheic dermatitis for years, and it was getting worse and worse. The best two things I did for myself was invest in a shower filter and buy this shampoo. After 6 months, my scalp is beautifully healthy and has STAYED HEALTHY for over a year now! I buy different shampoos in the Maple Holistics line and they all keep my scalp healthy. I can wear black shirts again! I tried almost every over the counter shampoo, prescription shampoo, steroids, anti-fungals--EVERYTHING. This is the only thing that works for my body chemistry. Thanks Maple Holistics!</li>
    <li> My once dull, lifeless and flake-infested hair is no bouncy, alive, clean and free from dandruff, all thanks to this shampoo!I like their conditioner as well! I use it with this.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive/dry skin/scalp problems. I also get keratin treatments for my hair so I needed a shampoo that was sulfate free that could control dandruff (which was difficult to find). Ordered sage shampoo from amazon and it has worked great and kept the problem under control.</li>
    <li> I thoughts it would get rid of my dandruff, yes the itchiness on my scalp somehow were relieve.  I am looking for a kind of shampoo that will totally removed my dandruff is there is one...</li>
    <li> It seems to work slowly, not overnight, give it about a week a so. The biggest selling point is it smells nicer than most natural shampoo on the market.</li>
    <li> My brother gave me this shampoo for a try as I had heavy dandruff and I tried every good and expensive shampoos in the market like T-gel, Nizoral, regenpure dr etc but nothing worked for me. But after using sage shampoo for heavy dandruff for 15 days I am amazed to see the results as this is an unbeatable shampoo. This shampoo is really life saver as my heavy dandruff and itching is almost gone and it makes the hair full of life, shiny and dandruff free. Another best thing is that it is full of natural ingredients nothing to harm for your hair. Maple Holistics is my favourite brand now and I would strongly recommend this shampoo to anyone who has severe dandruff problems. I will definitely order couple of bottles again.</li>
    <li> Good for getting weave glue out of hair.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews, because what other people say about the product rings fairly true. This is not one of those times. I&#x27;ve tried both the &amp;#34;Tea Tree&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Sage&amp;#34; products from Maple Holistics and I&#x27;ve never been so disappointed in a product in my life.&lt;br /&gt;Typically my dandruff is medium, nothing terrible but easily remedied with most anti-dandruff shampoos (usually uses pyrithione zinc).&lt;br /&gt;After close to a month of use and two different products, this is probably one of the worst shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SAGE:&lt;br /&gt;**Used as directed on the bottle**&lt;br /&gt;Pros: sulfate free? I can&#x27;t find a reason why this product should even be used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Has a distinct unmasked odor of a sage bush, not pleasant but tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;Does not alleviate dandruff, actually it made my dandruff and itch significantly worse than when I didn&#x27;t use anti-dandruff shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;Left my hair feeling &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34;, stiff and lacking moisture and natural oils. This is the first time I felt the need to actually use conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tea Tree:&lt;br /&gt;Hair felt significantly better when compared to the SAGE shampoo, but still did not even remotely help alleviate my dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have medium to severe dandruff like I do and many of the other 1-star reviews here, use products with pyrithione zinc, seems to be the only thing that actually works and is proven to work. Sulfur products work, but they smell absolutely horrible.</li>
    <li> I have had trouble with severe dandruff for several years, and the traditional Head &amp; Shoulders-type shampoos just don&#x27;t seem to work well... add to that the fact that I have very irritable skin, and you have a recipe for frustration. I found Maple Holistic&#x27;s Sage shampoo by scouring the internet for something natural but effective, and I wish I&#x27;d found it sooner-- it isn&#x27;t a miracle potion, of course, and you really must use it consistently (it is the only shampoo I use now, and I wash with it every other day) in order for it to be effective. I have found that it works best when followed by a good-quality natural conditioner. Lastly, yes, it is a bit pricier than I&#x27;m used to paying for shampoo, but when contrasted with how I was doing before, it is definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I have heavy dandruff and this seems to be that best dandruff shampoo I&#x27;ve used so far. It keeps my dandruff to a minimum, only when I use it every day though, if I skip a day, my dandruff comes back. I used to use head and shoulders, but it was damaging  my hair. This shampoo doesn&#x27;t and it has natural ingredients. It smells good as well, like vics. Minus one star because the bottle is a little small for the price.</li>
    <li> great product! did a great job, left my hair silky and clean</li>
    <li> Smells good, but didn&#x27;t work as well as hoped.</li>
    <li> Not really good shampoo for a dandruff problems...</li>
    <li> after using it i feel like my hair got more dry and i dont feel nothing special about it.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t really had problems with dandruff and itchy scalp until recently. I&#x27;m not sure what triggered this problem, because I had never had to deal with this issue before. I have been using this shampoo for close to 4 months and it is WONDERFUL! I am very picky about products I use on my hair and I love everything about this shampoo. The strong smell of sage and the tingle it gives my head makes me feel like my hair and scalp are being thoroughly cleaned. But I did notice that if you don&#x27;t leave the shampoo on your head for at least three minutes it is not as effective. With this shampoo my dandruff and itching is now mostly gone, my everyday life is not bothered anymore. I would recommend this product to anyone with problems with dandruff. I plan on using this shampoo for as long as I can!</li>
    <li> This stuff works fantastically- much better than the store-bought name brand I&#x27;ve been using. I have very thick and severe dandruff with terrible buildup on my scalp and nothing seems to work for me. This did. I love the smell, too. My only complaint is that the bottle is pretty tiny and with my thick hair it went pretty fast.</li>
    <li> I love how this product smells!  It worked real well on my hair that is prone to dandruff.  Typically my hair has a buildup feeling in it after using certain products, this one did not at all.  Would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Got this for psoriasis;  looking for a shampoo without Laureth/Lauryl Sulfate, to reduce drying of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Worse. By far. This stuff could turn a grape into a deadly weapon. Could make a jellyfish brittle. My quest for the perfect &#x27;poo continues.&lt;br /&gt;But if you have a profusely lubricating scalp, it smells good.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE it. I started using this shampoo after trying tons of other shampoos for my dandruff. This is the only one that helps and the smell is awesome.</li>
    <li> I received this in a gift basket that I won and I absolutely love it. It has really helped with the dandruff. I love that it is natural and sulfate free. I am a believer and never want to use shampoos with harsh chemicals on my hair ever again. This is a great product and I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dandruff and it works very well. The bottle is a little smaller than thought it would be for the price but still worth it. I will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done some crazy holistic approaches to rid my dandruff... Its embarrassing. Not anymore this stuff is great.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, you need just a little bit and lathers profusely, rinses off easily leaving your hair squeaky clean and is certainly helping with the dandruff around my hair line!</li>
    <li> Finally I have found a shampoo that helped my dry, itchy scalp while  leaving my hair vibrant and full, which is a big issue for me since I have fine hair. I began to see results within a few days, but used the shampoo for over a month to make sure that the results  were steady before writing a review. The rich lather and pleasant aroma were so much better than previous dandruff shampoos, I really was pleasantly surprised while in the shower. Coming from Ohio, where winters lately are very cold and blustery, I have found a shampoo that eliminated my dry flaky scalp and I gave me full healthy  looking hair, something I never had. I&#x27;m so happy I finally found one!</li>
    <li> Works great to protect hairs from Dandruff. The smell is good and the organic ingredient keeps hair healthy and smooth</li>
    <li> Works great and showed improvement.</li>
    <li> Sage shampoo was recommended by my doctor of Chinese medicine for the scalp itch I had been dealing with for months.  The itching was reduced after the first shampoo but by the third wash the itch was gone. I was using it every day - hoping it would keep the itch away but finally decided to try washing every 2 days then evey three days. The itch has stayed away!  Not only did it make my hair soft and bouncy but it also. has kept the color from fading.  I was using it&#x27;s a 10, which I liked because of the way it left my hair soft and full, but sage shampoo has its a 10 beat in that regard.  I also used silk 18 as a conditioner and like the way it leaves my hair shiny and soft.  I  will keep using these  product - ithey are my new favorites!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mild dandruff for a year but that elevated to heavy dandruff with an itchy, red scalp within the past few months. I also used to have greasy and messy hair in the mornings upon waking up. Head &amp; Shoulders and Neutrogena T-Gel didn&#x27;t do anything. This shampoo works! Perhaps because of the natural ingredients. I now wash my hair once at night and my hair still looks good in the morning. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a bit over a week. No more dandruff, no more itching. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
    <li> I absolutely looove this shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;Left me and my daughter&#x27;s scalp clean and no dandruff! I left it on my hair for five minutes before I rinsed it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I used the shampoo I was so surprised to realize we don&#x27;t have to use conditioner any longer because it detangled our hair beautifully, that was never the case with any shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve tried most brands out there.&lt;br /&gt; My daughter does apply a little bit of a leave-in conditioner after because her hair is really thick and coarse and the leave-in gives her curls a nice boost.&lt;br /&gt; Our hair is left feeling softer with this shampoo, and with the last dandruff shampoo I used it left my hair feeling like straw!&lt;br /&gt;I will keep purchasing this shampoo as long as it keeps working and I can keep affording it because it&#x27;s a bit on the expensive side :/&lt;br /&gt;Now, unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for my husband at all, hence the four stars!  Doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not a great shampoo, you just have to try it to see if it&#x27;s the right shampoo for you.&lt;br /&gt;As for me and daughter, we love it, and I will keep recommending it to everyone I know that suffers from a dry and flaky scalp!&lt;br /&gt;Also, quick tip, I like to apply a vinegar rinse once a week, for those that can tolerate the smell it also helps with flakes and leaves your hair shiny! And your hair isn&#x27;t left smelling like vinegar after you rinse it out. Hope it works for you as well as it did for us :)</li>
    <li> This was my first purchase of Sage shampoo and I wanted to wait at least a couple months after receiving it in order to give a true evaluation.  This is hands down the best dandruff shampoo I have ever used for many reasons.  To start, my dandruff was gone in a week and has never returned.  I used it every day the first few days, then went to every other day for the next few weeks.  Now, I can even shampoo twice a week with no problem.  It took just a little longer for the itching to go away, but that is completely gone as well.  A small amount goes a long way, so you will not need to reorder for a good while.  It has a really pleasant scent as well.  Absolutely nothing bad to say about it-don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase.  When you consider how effective it works and how sparingly you need to apply, it&#x27;s clearly a better value than the commercial brands.</li>
    <li> Happy to use this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a couple months now. At first, I hated it because I was not used to sulfate-free shampoos. I would apply a small quarter size like what the label say. Sulfate is meant to create lather for the shampoo. So without it, it was hard to lather it on my thick super long hair. I then started applying double the size and it lathers enough to my satisfaction. I am super happy with the purchase. In addition, it smells really nice. Will definitely continue buying more when I run out.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is so, so, so,  great. It&#x27;s the only one that really helped lessen my dandruff in weeks. No more rip offs for me! I&#x27;ve finally found my product!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of anti-dandruff shampoos without any real relief. I felt a huge difference after the first use, and the fact that it does not contain any sulfates or fragrances makes me feel even better. I would recommend this for anyone who has dandruff issues.</li>
    <li> I have now just about finished the entire bottle of Sage shampoo and I have personally verified that it did not strip my colored hair but tackled my dandruff beautifully. I had not been able to wear any dark solid color tops for years  due to the flakes. I didn&#x27;t dare use a dandruff shampoo because my hair color turned brassy. This shampoo solved my problems and I am about to reorder my 2nd bottle. I use a tiny bit of Redken conditioner after my shampoo but I&#x27;ve found that this shampoo doesn&#x27;t make my hair too dry at all. I lather up twice as my friend who used to be a hairdresser advised. First lather doesn&#x27;t lather up a lot...rinse and lather up again. Now I get a big lather (which I enjoy). Rinse, condition a tiny bit and hair and scalp turn out great. That was my experience.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural anti dandruff shampoo that smelled nice &amp; left my hair feeling clean and fresh and I found it. It may not work for really heavy dry scalp, but it was perfect for me! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Yes, i did not find any issue nor find any positive solution on this one.&lt;br /&gt;but what i heard that, sulfate free products are good for dandroof hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had dandruff for years, but I could never find a product that worked for me. I&#x27;ve tried Head &amp; Shoulders, home remedies, etc. But within a few uses of this shampoo, there was a significant improvement. The bottle is a little smaller than store bought shampoos. It smells very natural and kinda like tea tree, but I personally love the smell. Look no further!! This shampoo is a miracle worker. I can&#x27;t wait to try their other products.</li>
    <li> Love the creamy texture and the smell was great!! I feel like it did help with my dry itchy scalp! I would order this again.</li>
    <li> After using this shampoo for two weeks my dandruff has noticeably improved and my scalp is less itchy. Finally a great shampoo that is sulfate free!</li>
    <li> My husband has dry flakes. He tried several expensive brand name shampoo such as Aveda. I also gave him a scalp massage with argon oil. None of products helped him to remove his dry flakes. Now my husband washes his hair with this shampoo and massages his scalp with a scalp massage brush. Flakes are almost GONE. I am really glad to find this great product and I got out of all the stress from white dirts on my husband&#x27;s shoulder. However, I wish I sometimes get a special promotion. This product is really expensive.</li>
    <li> it smells really good and it worked</li>
    <li> Skin was less itchy but no change in dandruff at all.</li>
    <li> I had tried all of the store brand dandruff shampoos with no luck and not to mention they were damaging my color treated hair. This shampoo has really helped my dandruff and my hair feels great &amp; healthy! Great product... Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo to mix up my normal routine of raw honey, baking soda and ACV. I have used the sage shampoo 3 times in 3 weeks and have been happy with the results each time.  I cannot say whether this has improved my condition but it hasn&#x27;t worsened it by any means. The scent is lovely; a very welcome reprieve from the lingering aroma of vinegar.  After months of the same regimen this shampoo has been a luxury I look forward to each week! I would order this again and plan to check out the other products Maple Holistics has to offer.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it is organic ingredient and sulfate free. My hair had keratin treatment that required to use Sulfate free shampoo. It is the right chose for my hair. I hate my dandruff that boring me while i am in the meeting. i feel itching and the dandruff fall down. I feel ashamed in-front of my boss and co worker. Now, i have no problem at all.</li>
    <li> the only thing that ever helped my dandruff</li>
    <li> Did foam and wash hair. I felt mislead that this was in some way a natural, chemical free product, but read the ingredients.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been used to another product but have been changing over to organic and biodegradable as I become more Earth friendly. This product does just as well with my scalp and dandruff as the previous product I used but is more environmentally friendly. AND IT STILL WORKS GREAT!</li>
    <li> Worked very well! Within one wash I felt a drastic decrease in the amount of dandruff. The smell is quite strong but once you condition you barely smell it.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly. I used Head &amp; Shoulders, but it didn&#x27;t work. Instead, I bought this product, it is functional!</li>
    <li> I love it,It is incredible to leave my hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Recent purchase.  I was looking for an alternative to the heavily medicated (and formerly prescription) shampoos.  So far, I&#x27;m extremely happy.  The shampoo is lightly scented and works into a nice lather.  My scalp is &#x27;flaking less&amp;#34; and is definitely less itchy.  I&#x27;ll continue to use only this shampoo until the psoriasis is under control and then I&#x27;ll alternate it with my &#x27;regular&#x27; shampoo.</li>
    <li> Sage is so much better than any other homeopathic anti-dandruff shampoo that I have used since my search began a couple of years ago. The itch and flakes are under control, not gone, but so far I am very pleased with the results. The lather is rich, it smells clean and fresh, not as heavy on the tea tree scent as I had originally thought because those products are out there and they are strong. It is a bit pricey, but a little goes a long way. I would like to see and feel more luster; however, for now the product meets my need for an anti-dandruff solution.</li>
    <li> The only shampoo thats gets rid of my dandruff!!</li>
    <li> My husband had severe dandruff, so I chose  this Sage Dandruff Shampoo for him. After using 2 monthes, his dandruff reduced much. It also worked for me, I had a itchy scalp, this shampoo made my scalp comfortable. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I recently switched to using shampoo bars, because I heard that conventional shampoos really damages the hair. I love it except I don&#x27;t get the smooth feeling I do after using regular shampoo and conditioner. Searched everywhere for a natural hair conditioner to use after using the shampoo bar and found this wonderful product. It does the job, leaving my hair silky smooth ..</li>
    <li> Review Update: I&#x27;m almost finished with the first bottle that I bought and I still feel the same. I just ordered 2 bottles so I will not run out of it anytime soon. This is a wonderful product and I am very glad that I found it. It still amazes me how effective it is compared to the other products that you buy in the store. If you suffer from dandruff, try this product and see if it works for you.   Original Review: I am excited to write this review because it is very effective for me. For my background, I have had dandruff flare ups on and off over the years since I was a teenager. I have tried over-the-counter products but it just irritated my scalp. I am always on the lookout for the perfect product for me and now I finally found it. On my second wash, my scalp feels AMAZING after drying my hair. No more itchiness and now I can style my hair without worrying about white flakes. I never really expected it to be this effective that I was shocked when it actually worked. Even though it is more expensive than other shampoos, I can never go back to the others. Try it for a week and you will see the difference.</li>
    <li> my hair feels great after using this shampoo</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a lover of products with natural ingredients, and have tried the gamut of natural anti-dandruff shampoos. With that zeal, I purchased this promising product with great customer reviews.  After many uses, I can assuredly say, that for me, this shampoo belongs in the category of underperforming shampoos to clear heavy dandruff.  If anything, I&#x27;d say, the condition, having not been checked as much as it could have been in each wash, has worsened in few weeks of using this.  3-stars for a good try.  But sorry, it fails the claim of being the choice for &amp;#34;Heavy Dandruff&amp;#34;... at least in my case!</li>
    <li> this was a great shampoo.  the texture is very thick and started working on my second wash. the anti-dandruff claim is true.  during our allergy season, this shampoo has helped me alot!</li>
    <li> I have been dealing with dandruff for many years now and I have gone through countless of bottles of every drugstore antidandruff shampoo you could possibly name and they all seemed to work for the first 2 or 3 times; however, they would all stop working way before I was done with the bottle. Last month while I was visiting a friend I washed my hair at her place and noticed how my hair was incredibly shiny and dandruff free after it dried, I was happy but didn&#x27;t get too excited thinking it would be the same as with the other products I&#x27;ve tried. My friend gave me her bottle and I am now finishing it, I am glad to say I may have finally found the answer to my problems!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent dandruff shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and it works a lot better for me than products containing selenium sulfide or pyrithione zinc. It significantly helped my dandruff and itchy scalp. Like everything else I tried, it&#x27;s not a cure, but it&#x27;s a highly effective treatment and the best I&#x27;ve used so far. It also doesn&#x27;t contain sulfates which seems to reduce itchiness and dryness. The only downside is the price. It&#x27;s steep when compared to the standard dandruff shampoo but for me it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> This Sage Shampoo from Maple Holistics gives off a nice scent and it is noticeably effective against scalp inflammation or dermatitis.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like how it dried my hair out. Didn&#x27;t seem to stop itching. Maybe a few less flakes. Don&#x27;t think I will finish using or buy again.</li>
    <li> I have fine, color-treated hair and have had a terribly itchy scalp for months,  No flakes, just itch, and nothing helped.  My daughter recommended this shampoo to me and it works.  I had relief from the first use and by the second use the itch was gone.  I love the way it feels and smells, it&#x27;s very rich and takes just a small amount.  I would highly recomment this product.  I plan on trying other Maple Holistic products in the future.</li>
    <li> I have tried every shampoo I can think of for my dandruff that doesn&#x27;t have sulfates and NONE of them come close to working as well as Sage Shampoo. No more itchy scalp, no more build-up, and no more flakes. Just shiny and clean hair that doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down (unlike the L&#x27;oreal sulfate free line). I have waited for years to find something like this and am SO glad I did! Thank you Maple Holistics!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the BEST shampoos out there.  The Sage cleans your scalp and hair and eliminates dandruff in one use.  It also makes your hair squeaky clean.  It smells wonderful and lathers SO well.  It&#x27;s a VERY good buy and a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This shampoo works very well.  My sensative skin was not affected by it.  It does smell VERY strongly of sage.  If that is a scent you enjoy a lot then you would be very happy with this. If it is not a smell you like, do not buy this.  I have no issues other than the smell.  It is not gross, it smells nice.  It is just not what I want to smell like.</li>
    <li> Finally a dandruff shampoo that works for me. This is great!</li>
    <li> Had dandruff and itchy scalp from allergies and living in the Mohave Desert.&lt;br /&gt;First time I used it I could tell the difference. Second time I was sold!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is real fine, so I use a couple of drops of Natural Valley Naturals, organic, cold-pressed, &amp; kosher Sesame Oil for control.</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectations! Having the peace of mind of washing your head with a shampoo containing nothing but natural ingredients is absolutely essential; no one likes an irritated scalp caused by the various chemicals they use in shampoos nowadays! The products at Maple Holistics are the only way to go to maintain a healthy scalp and hair AND naturally get rid of dandruff, once and for all! A+</li>
    <li> This shampoo has improved my scalp dermatitis in under a week and I am hopeful it will continue to improve. My scalp is much less itchy too.  I love the smell of sage so I love the potent herb scent of this shampoo. A little goes a long way which makes it a better value. I definitely will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Amazing shampoo! After the second use, I can clearly see that there are fewer flakes and my scalp is less itchy. I love the pleasant smell and the fact that there is no chemical in the ingredients. I will keep using it and hope for a healthy scalp with no big flake!</li>
    <li> I always want new products to work right away and they never do. This, however, seems to be and I am thrilled!! I have been dealing with stubborn dry scalp for years with no luck and had decided it must be hormoronal and wouldn&#x27;t be fixed until we were done having babies &amp; nursing. I am so grateful this seems to no longer be the case!!! </li>
    <li> I bought this product for my 10 year old daughter. She has been struggling with dandruff off and on for a couple of years. We&#x27;ve tried the two major name brand dandruff shampoos, all they did was make her hair look greasy and not reduce the dandruff. So I took a chance on this product, and so happy I did! The first time we used it, it seemed to exfoliate her scalp. And every time after that there was less and less dandruff. We have been using this product every other day for the past 2 weeks and her dandruff is gone. I also bought Argan Oil Conditioner - 8 0z - Purest Formula - Natural Treatment for Dry and Damaged Hair -and the Argan Oil Shampoo, Sulfate Free - With Argan, Jojoba, Avocado, Almond, Peach Kernel, Camellia Seed, and Keratin - 100% Safe for Color Treated Hair for myself to try. And I am in love with these products. My daughter and I have  thick hair and these products leave our hair soft and very manageable. So much so that I don&#x27;t need to do much to my hair other than dry it. It&#x27;s nice to enjoy the hair cut my stylist gave me without having to add products or more heat to get my hair to cooperate.</li>
    <li> I t smells really great and feels very nice to the hair. It leaves it soft, shiny and fresh-smelling all day while also working on lessening dandruff flakes. I like it very much. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used it for one month. It works great for me. It solved my dandruff problem. Although the Head &amp; Shoulders also works for me, I find this one also helps my oil hear. I don&#x27;t feel oil or itch anymore and I feel refreshed after using it.</li>
    <li> My head skin is very dry, especially in winter with a lot of dandruff. I kept searching for many types of shampoos (moisturizing shampoos to shampoos for dandruff)  that can help to remove dandruff. I was not satisfied with any of them except Sage. many shampoos for dandruff out there contain Zn and sulfonate that made my hair even drier. Now I&#x27;m pretty happy with Sage after 1 week of using it. Sage did not work very well for me at the first time, but I&#x27;ve realized that dandruff is going away after each wash. I really love smell of this shampoo and love the feeling that my hair is getting softer and healthier. I&#x27;m just wondering if I should stick to this shampoo forever (it&#x27;s pretty expensive) or can I use the Tea Tree Oil Shampoo for Moderate Dandruff with Organic Lavender &amp; Rosemary after my dandruff problem gets better by using Sage....</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for couple of months now. So far it is working and I would order more. Hopefully my search for good shampoo is over.</li>
    <li> Very fragrant and very effective!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for over a year and it works great. I&#x27;ve never had terrible dandruff, but was often told by barbers that my hair was very dry. Since I started using this, my hair has felt much better and I haven&#x27;t had to deal with any disparaging comments! I haven&#x27;t been using conditioner with it, but my girlfriend uses both the shampoo and conditioner and is very happy with both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price jumps around a bit, so you might try waiting to see if you can catch it at a low point. It&#x27;s also not a huge quantity, but for me (male, short hair) it lasts several months.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a shampoo that will remedy my dry and flaky scalp for years. I have tried drug store brands and other natural products. I found Sage Shampoo through Amazon, read the ingredients and details about the product. In addition, I have read the reviews as well to keep me more informed. Since I am a proponent of products made for natural sources, I definitely gave Sage Shampoo a try. I am very pleased with the results, in about three days of consistent use, I noticed a dramatic decrease in flaking and itchiness on my scalp. I will continue to use the product on a daily basis for about a week and use it every other day with my other treatment shampoo and condition. Thanks Maple Holistics for making this product!</li>
    <li> This shampoo works like a charm c:</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not normally one to try &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products, but i am hooked. I bought this shampoo recently hoping to finally find something that would help with my dandruff. I&#x27;ve been to doctors, been on steroid cremes for it, been to dermatologists - nothing has worked until this shampoo!! Thank you Maple Holistics for a great product. It is such a relief to finally have this under control.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo I have struggled for a few years now with very bad dry skin and dandruff it got quite embarrasing even going out in public because my hair is blonde and you could just see the flakes.. if tried so many different products and this one is in my top 2 I would recommend it highly ..lathers very well and smells good  ever since i started using it i see no sign of it recurring. A+</li>
    <li> I really like the effects of using the natural shampoo to combat my itchy scalp. It smelled nice and I could tell after using the product for a month of the effects. The only downfall of this product is that it doesn&#x27;t lather like my other brand and would find myself using more of the product to get the &#x27;shampoo&#x27; effect. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> love the smell and it works!!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo definitely helped my dandruff but was a bit too harsh for me to use more than once a week. You only need a little bit and I would recommend using a deep conditioner after shampooing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a pharmacist and have a deep background in compounding and chemistry.  I have learned to steer clear of any &amp;#34;Holistic&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34; products because they blatantly lie and are run by agents who want to exploit a crazy fringe.  I&#x27;ve had a LIFE LONG problem with eczema on my scalp, do to allergies and compounded by fungus when I wear a hat.  I was AMAZED that after only 2 uses I can see down to my plain skin on my scalp when looking in the mirror and all the escema was gone..  I&#x27;ve been using Pantene for years because it is the best I could find, but this set a WHOLE other standard of clean for my hair.  I&#x27;m not in love with the woodsy smell, but you can&#x27;t argue with the results.  Very Good.  I&#x27;m recommending it anyone who asks....  Ruben Safir</li>
    <li> Still a few pesky flakes here and there but a drastic improvement. It is a bit pricy but a little does go a long way. Just ordered a second bottle.</li>
    <li> Cleared up my itchy scalp after 1 use. Still itchy free 1 week later. Very impressed. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have eczema and have always struggled with dry skin all over my body. Lately my itchy dry flaky scalp was only getting worse and after my mom dropped this off at our house a few weeks ago I looked it up and liked the natural ingredients and tried it right away. In the past three weeks I have stopped itching and my flakes are gone! I&#x27;m so thankful for this product. Maple organics has a bunch of other stuff I want to try.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. It&#x27;s a good dandruff shampoo and he likes the scent. Good product for the price, and it works.</li>
    <li> leathers great&lt;br /&gt;cleans fine&lt;br /&gt;smells delicious&lt;br /&gt;Did not have time to check antidandruff claims but works great for color treated hair, does not strip color&lt;br /&gt;overall great product!</li>
    <li> This works as well or better than other dandruff shampoos I&#x27;ve tried (I&#x27;ve tried them all) but without all the harsh chemicals. Unlike some of the other natural chemical/paraben/sulfate free shampoos, this one creates a nice thick lather so a little goes a long way. It also smells pleasant, like the essential oils it contains.</li>
    <li> My husband has a kind of dander that usually has to be taken care of with a prescription shampoo, but with this and rotating with another couple kind of specialty otc shampoos, his hair and scalp is fine and we don&#x27;t have to buy the prescription stuff.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is a wonderful buy! It is free from sulfates and other harsh chemicals, and only contains all natural, organic ingredients. For this reason, it is super gentle of your hair and leaves your hair feeling clean, healthy and smelling great! While showering, this shampoo permeates throughout the bathroom and gives off a very therapeutic and soothing smell. The smell is super relaxing, and stays in your hair even after you&#x27;ve styled it for the day. While the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather as much as other shampoos I&#x27;ve used, it still gets your hair clean, and free of dandruff super quickly. I used this shampoo since I&#x27;ve had issues with a dry scalp in the past, and even after the first use I saw and felt a difference in my scalp. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone, whether they had heavy dandruff, a dry scalp, or simply just needed a fresh new shampoo for their nightly shower.</li>
    <li> This product is great!! Before using this product I bought an expensive french anti-dandruff shampoo and I used it as the directions said, and nothing really happened. So, I decided to look for something natural to try out and I heard about this shampoo and I&#x27;ve seen improvement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some tough dandruff that was stuck on my scalp. Whenever it got loose it would create big flakes. After using the shampoo once my hair was full of loose small dandruff. That probably doesn&#x27;t sound good, but it was actually good because it loosened up my tough dandruff that was stuck to my scalp. So, far I have used my shampoo for the forth time, and now there is so much less loose flakes and dandruff overall. I&#x27;m glad that each time it&#x27;s getting better, and I still have a lot more of the bottle to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me it wasn&#x27;t an overnight cure, but then again I had some tough dandruff.</li>
    <li> Normally Dandruff Shampoos smell like Medicine but this shampoo doesn&#x27;t. It left my head feeling fresh with a natural smell. My Dandruff was immediately gone and lasts about 2-3 days. So I recommend washing your hair with this shampoo at least 2-3 time a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only two cons with this item is the expensive price and the size of the bottle could be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a heads up don&#x27;t scratch your hair if it gets itchy and apply this shampoo right after. It could slightly burn where you just scratched your hair which is expected to happen with any Dandruff Shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo made my dandruff so much worse! I don&#x27;t know if the reviews for this product are real. It dries up my hair and makes my scalp very itchy. Very disappointed. I have oily type of hair and I need a product that doesn&#x27;t remove natural oils like this one does. Stay away and get shampoo bar with Tea Tree Oil.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS PURE MAGIC! I saw a 90% improvement after one use. I was skeptical going the all natural route but was  getting pretty desparate. I would have to brush off my suit jacket at work several times a day and stick my hair in a pony tail. I tried Head and Shoulders, Selsun Blue, and nothing worked. On day two and I&#x27;m almost completly flake free. I can&#x27;t wait to see how this works long term. Wish it was cheaper but totally worth the price!!</li>
    <li> DID NOT WORK FOR ME..Used this shampoo because my hair got flaky but it made it much worse just after 3-4 uses.I took a break and try using the shampoo.I tried this way atleast 3 times in the past 3 months..Every time I come back to Sage,I saw the same results..Nizoral shampoo controls my flaky hair very well,instead</li>
    <li> This SAGE shampoo worked GREAT on my scalp! It worked after 2 days &amp; cleared up my problem within 1 weeks time. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! I waited a while and was very patient for the results, and voila! My hair is super silky, just as you would see in those ads on tv, and a family friend of mine has been asking me if I straighten my hair everyday. My hair feels softer, bouncy and looks really shiny. I recomend this to all people who suffer from dandruff</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to keep my hair and scalp free from scaly dust. But the price is a bit stiff. I would probably buy the regular dandriff remover at Walmart.</li>
    <li> When the day ends, I like taking another shower. This is great for thoroughly cleansing my hair with its formula and it also has a refreshing and calming scent.</li>
    <li> Just a week of use and I already feel a big difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> This product is definitely helping!</li>
    <li> In the directions of the Shampoo Bottle, it states to pour a quarter-size amount into your fingers, and scrub for a few minutes.    A DIME size amount is sufficient, and this product will foam up your entire scalp, with what appears to be a natural foaming agent based on coconut. In the cleansing aspect, I give this product five stars.    HOWEVER, I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about two weeks. I wash my hair every other day to keep from hair thinning, etc. (i&#x27;m a male with rather delicate hair). I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant improvement dandruff-wise. Perhaps I need to use it for a longer period of time, hopefully by then it will have done its effect.    - Arturo</li>
    <li> I have dermatitis and had been using head and shoulders everyday, it was the only thing that worked. After trying several things to get more natural relief I found this. Very happy!</li>
    <li> I like the company. This product doesn&#x27;t really leave a scent after you use it. Kinda wanted to gnarly after scent but I dig it.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this shampoo!  So far it is working out well.  I&#x27;ve tried several products with no success.  I felt a noticeable difference after using this once.</li>
    <li> I have long dry hair, but also have dandruff problem. I&#x27;m still not sure what is the reason. Sage shampoo works well so far, but hopefully it will last longer.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. For years I have been fighting dandruff and dermatitis. I have tried every over the counter product out there and some prescription and nothing has worked and felt as good as this sage shampoo. It leaves me flake and itch free and smells great. It has a nice and subtle fragrance that is appropriate for men or women. It does not make me smell like a flower shop and the best part is, it actually works!! I am sold! I can&#x27;t wait to find out how this company&#x27;s other products work.</li>
    <li> I should start by saying I use it on my beard and not my hair, but it&#x27;s amazing how well this works.  I use it for one day, maybe two, and my skin stops itching and flaking for weeks.  I suppose if I used it daily I&#x27;d never have any problems, but I&#x27;m willing to let it go for a while.  The only drawback is that it smells like tree bark, mostly eucalyptus, so I smell it on my beard for hours.  I consider that a small price to pay.</li>
    <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of harsh chemicals in it. It helps control itching, but I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week and I haven&#x27;t noticed any real difference in my scalp dryness. I also thought the product was expensive for not getting much.  I would have been happier paying that price if it worked.  Coal tar shampoo works better for me.</li>
    <li> Have only used the shampoo 3 times, but so far so good. I have eczema and the shampoo eliviates the itching and flakes for 3 days. I&#x27;m hoping it will be longer with prolonged use. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo.The smell is not bother me at all, but for some people probably will.I love to use sage a lot in my live so I want to see how shampoo will work,and works good.I have short hair so I don&#x27;t have to use conditioner but some people have to.Just little drop and are big bubbles, :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one to normally leave reviews, in fact, I think this is my first review on Amazon. However, this product has earned it. I think I&#x27;ve bought maybe 5 or 6 bottles of this shampoo and I&#x27;m hooked. I swear by this shampoo. My hair used to be so oily and I would get flakes non-stop with any shampoo that had sulfur/sulfates in it. Not only did this product save my scalp, but my hair looks, feels and smells amazing! I refuse to use other shampoos now and hopefully will be using this product for years to come. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This works great. It&#x27;s so hard to find a dandruff shampoo that&#x27;s sulfate free; this has been a lifesaver for me and my color-treated hair. Only complaint is the smell... a little medicinal.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a wonderful fragrance. I have severe scalp issues and have to wash my hair daily to avoid build-up. This shampoo is gentle yet not heavy, as many moisturizing shampoos can be.  I even use it as a body wash on trouble areas such as knees and elbows.</li>
    <li> The Argan shampoo actually controlled my dandruff better than this Sage version.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong,&lt;br /&gt;this Sage version has reduced my dandruff a lot, by say 60%. But the Argan version virtually eliminated&lt;br /&gt;my dandruff completely.  And this Sage version costs more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the smell of the Sage but for more money, I would expect at least equal results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be going back to the Argan.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my mom. She started using this shampoo and it has relieved her itchy scalp, she says it works well and smells good too!</li>
    <li> Love the smell, but didn&#x27;t really do anything to help my dandruff.</li>
    <li> I just received the shampoo today and I&#x27;ve used it...IMMEDIATELY I felt a difference it felt clean an for once my scalp wasn&#x27;t itchy right after!!! i will definitely be using from now on!!</li>
    <li> For almost a year now, I have had dandruff. It&#x27;s been disgusting, annoying, just itchy. I have been prescribed medicated dandruff shampoos that barely did anything for me. I came across this shampoo a couple weeks ago and decided to buy it. Let me just say, I have used this shampoo only two times so far and it has already reduced my dandruff by at least half. I am so thrilled that something finally works! I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens as I continue to use it. Also, it smells amazing and is a therapeutic experience. My hair finally feels clean and just plain happy!!</li>
    <li> Product didn&#x27;t work for me and I would say it&#x27;s not a good value for the usefulness of the product. I recommend Jason&#x27;s product for scalp treatment over this, it works much better and makes your hair much softer.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo. I dont bother with conditioner anymore... nor flakes, nor itchiness(if I dont go too long without shampooing my head). Cant really stand the smell. reminds me of rosemary bushes. None the less it works.</li>
    <li> Sure, it cleans my hair nicely, but it does not help my sebborheac dermatitis on my scalp.  Tea tree oil doesn&#x27;t work, either.  The only over the counter stuff that has worked for me so far is extra strength coal tar.  As that is a carcinogen, I am really hoping to find something better.  Trying pine tar next...</li>
    <li> Love the Sage, leaves my scalp feeling clean and fresh. Helps with my seborrhea dermatitis as well, keeps it under control&lt;br /&gt;And alleviates the itch. Thank you Maple Holistic&#x27;s for a product that works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other Maple Holistics products, but decided to venture out and try something new. The Sage Shampoo gives a great clean, and leaves my scalp feeling fresh and tingly! On top of that, a noticeable flakiness reduction will make this a repeat purchase without a doubt.</li>
    <li> I have short, bleached and dyed hair, so it&#x27;s important to me to have a color safe, sulfate free product. I have light to moderate itchy dandruff and I&#x27;ve often just suffered because I really disliked the current dandruff products available in stores, but it&#x27;s gotten so badly lately that I was getting desperate. Since this product had such great ratings and sounded promising, I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive since been using it for a couple days and I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in my scalp&#x27;s condition!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It has a peppermint scent straight out of the bottle that fades post-lather, which I prefer, because it can be a little strong for someone who isn&#x27;t a fan of peppermint. However, I will take peppermint over the chemical smell of other drugstore shampoos! It&#x27;s not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;* It doesn&#x27;t sting or feel menthol-y during use, another plus for me. My scalp isn&#x27;t sensitive, however I do not like menthol products, which is another way this product stands apart from drugstore shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;* It leaves my hair soft &amp; clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;* I only need a small dollop of shampoo to wash my scalp &amp; it lathers wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s organic, sulfate free, &amp; cruelty free! (:</li>
    <li> This works very well. My scalp is no longer sore!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife and no more dandruff!  She is amazed at well how well it works for her.</li>
    <li> I have colored hair and was worried about using a dandruff shampoo but this shampoo does not dull color. I have been using it every other day for about 3 weeks and my dandruff has completely gone. I do use a conditioner after as the shampoo leaves my hair almost feeling too clean. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about the smell but after washing and drying my hair, it smells great!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this shampoo for dandruff and even for normal hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works a lot better than previous ones that I&#x27;ve tried, but it still doesn&#x27;t entirely clear my dandruff. I absolutely love the smell, though, and it manages my dandruff enough that I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t stop my dandruff, but reduced it slightly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this purchase. It smells great and effectively controlled my dry scalp. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have not had a chance to use it over a 90 day period , but for right now it seems to work! The only thing so far i do not like is the  strong Sage oder left behind after you wash/rinse - in public this can/could be mistaken as weed,cannabis,etc...which i do not use ! but besides that i like the product.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from dandruff for years. From Head and Shoulders to Selsun Blue, I felt i had tried almost everything. Selsun Blue (working the best) worked for a little while but the problem would still occur. I figured I&#x27;d go in a different direction this time. After seeing videos and reading articles about how bad and harmful the chemicals in some of these products can be over time to both your hair and your scalp, I decided to look for something organic. I stumbled across this products on Google and YouTube. I saw nothing but good reviews. Still...feeling a little skeptical about about the results of this product, I finally decided to get the Sage Shampoo and gamble on their Silk18 Conditioner as well. I have to say I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. After a shower I could feel a difference in my hair and scalp. It wasn&#x27;t till the next morning that i was even more impressed when i noticed that there was hardly any dandruff on my black pillow case. I&#x27;m glad I found something that works!</li>
    <li> Started suffering from dandruff in an area on the back of my head over the past year. Stress and diet were probably to blame. I tried using tea tree oil to treat the area, but it was difficult remembering to use the tea tree oil consistently. I went on the hunt for a shampoo that treated dandruff, but was also sulfate-free and safe to use on color-treated hair. I found this product through Amazon and I love it! I instantly noticed results after the first use. The fragrance is light and not overwhelming like other dandruff shampoos. After using the product for a week, I am happy to report that my dandruff is under control (although the levels of stress and diet has not changed). This shampoo is a keeper!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo. I have struggled with dandruff for years this has helped beyond what I could have expected. Plus their customer service is the BEST. Please note if you have dry scalp which is NOT the same as dandruff, use the Hydrate shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have tried every dandruff shampoo, treatment, medicine known to man and nothing worked.  Some seemed to keep the flakes down to a minimum, but made my hair smell like tar. Others made my hair smell and feel fabulous but did nothing for the flakes! After reading through the many positive reviews I decided to give this shampoo a try.  I must admit, I was skeptical at first.  It was on the pricey side and it&#x27;s not a big container at all.  I used it as soon as I got it in the mail.  I quickly learned that a little bit of the shampoo goes a long way. I have very thick and kind of long hair and I use 2 small dollops and that&#x27;s plenty.  I must also note, that for me, my flakes did not disappear after the first shampoo.  I don&#x27;t know why I thought they might - I think it was wishful thinking! But by the second and third time, they were pretty much non existent.  The shampoo does tend to dry out your hair a bit, so make sure to get a good quality conditioner.  This product works!</li>
    <li> I tried a number of shampoos for a flaky scalp condition, but had to use heavy conditioners or use the shampoos infrequently. This shampoo does not dry my hair out as much. I am able to use it multiple times a week. The 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the smell. The shampoo smells somewhat medicinal, but does the job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used half the bottle and still have dandruff.</li>
    <li> Good if your hair has been treated with keratin.</li>
    <li> I have had flaking scalp for a while and it was so itchy. I&#x27;ve been searching for something for a while and decided to choose this product because of the great reviews. It was wonderful! My scalp has since been clean after a few days of use and the shampoo leaves my hair really soft and healthy. Not only that, but it smells so earthy and I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month, and have seen a significant difference in the amount of flakes and itchiness in my scalp. The dandruff isn&#x27;t totally gone, which is why 4 stars instead of 5, but is better for sure. I love that it&#x27;s natural, and it suds up really well for something that&#x27;s sulfate-free. The smell is a little too &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; for me, but it&#x27;s fine because it goes away or gets covered up by conditioner and other products. Can&#x27;t really see any difference in the appearance of my hair as compared to other shampoos - it&#x27;s not thicker or shinier or anything like that - but it feels fine and I&#x27;ll continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This worked much better for me than the Selsun Blue brand I was using from Walmart.  In one washing, it got rid of most of the itching and dandruff I&#x27;ve been struggling with for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely has a strong smell, but I think it&#x27;s worth it to have something that really works.  Also, I would like this product more if they gave you more than 8oz for $20.  But overall, I am satisfied and will likely buy again.</li>
    <li> Smells great, but doesn&#x27;t do anything for dandruff.</li>
    <li> I love the natural smell and that it is all natural ingredients.  It  feels great on my hair and scalp.  I have medium long hair thats fine but thick.  It takes less the a quarter size which should make it last longer.  Great product would recommend!</li>
    <li> As regular shampoo, this is pretty good. It&#x27;s sls-free but still suds up nice and it smells good. Leaves my hair a little stiff but it&#x27;s okay. As a dandruff shampoo, it fails. I still have the same amount of dandruff and itchiness as I did before I started using it.</li>
    <li> Every winter my daughter and I suffer from dandruff and itchy scalp. The shampoo that does work that I get at walmart smells horrible and does not last as long. This stuff works great, in fact probably better and it smells a hundred times better then the other stuff. I bought this the first time on a whim, and I have decided to continue using this product and have purchased this several times.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic!  I have tried H&amp;S, Aveda’s line and Neutrogena’s line.  No product works as well as this one does.  I had dandruff pretty bad and it was definitely noticeable.  I washed my hair daily with the shampoo as directed (you need to leave it on for 2 minutes at least, rinse, repeat).  I saw results after the first or second washing.  This product is scented, but it does not have a tar or any weird smell to it either.  I need conditioner, so I did use a “regular” conditioner after shampooing.  I couldn’t be happier with the product, and the shipping is very timely.</li>
    <li> This product has fixed my dandruff  really good but the downside is that its smells really bad ... And you have to keep using it in order to fix</li>
    <li> I like it but its a little to strong.</li>
    <li> Main problem is dermatitis. This did not help as some revierers stated. Have been most off the self and some proscriptions shampoos and nothing has helped. I may be the exception. As far as dandruff I don&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
    <li> This product contains DMDM Hydantoin, which is an antimicrobial formaldehyde releaser preservative. This ingredient is classified as a high hazard on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep Database. Such a high-hazard ingredient, in my opinion, has no place in a product that touts its natural and organic ingredients and is made by a company with the word &amp;#34;Holistics&amp;#34; in its name. The product also contains Triethanolamine, which is classified as a medium hazard in the EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Database. I would urge anyone interested in avoiding high-hazard ingredients in their cosmetics to look up each ingredient before buying. There are many companies engaged in &amp;#34;greenwashing,&amp;#34; and Maple Holistics is apparently one of them.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a bottle of this product because I wanted something that is specifically meant to treat dandruff, but without any harsh chemicals or medications. Being that this shampoo is medication free, I was skeptical. However, after just a week there has been noticeable improvement in the health of my dry scalp, and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed fewer flakes. I&#x27;m very happy with this shampoo!</li>
    <li> I so love this shampoo. It leaves my hair super silky smooth and soft. It has also helped with my itchy scalp. I don;t have dandruff but this is a nice way of prevention.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this for my poor head and I am very pleased with the results.  It does work...however, you do need to use the shampoo regularly...I like the smell...it smells very much like herbs!! But, I actually really like that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  My dandruff was getting extremely bad... Using this shampoo at least 2-3 times a week did the trick...it didn&#x27;t improve things instantly but as I kept using it...I now no longer have to worry about &#x27;snow&#x27; on my shoulders.  It leaves my scalp fresh, itch free, and it does seem to sooth the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I do like it very much! It&#x27;s just not a miracle product if you know what I mean.  DONT expect your dandruff to just disappear after a few uses.  The shampoo did work for me...but only over time and with regular use! But I like it because it is effective and it is a more natural product!</li>
    <li> I changed from a known brand dandruff shampoo to a Nature Valley. After a month of weeks of using it my hair began to have some severe dandruff. I bought this overpriced shampoo because it&#x27;s the first one in Amazon hoping it would be the most amazing thing ever; but boy, after a month of using it the only thing that I can say about it is that I&#x27;m disappointed. Although my hair isn&#x27;t as bad as it was a month ago, my clothes and glasses still get dirty with all the flakes that fall from my scalp. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll just return to a good brand like Fructis or Head and Shoulders.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this for her dandruff problem and loves it, so I&#x27;ve been using it too.  I am mostly bald, and it keeps my head really healthy.  No more oily shine, dry patches, or hair follicle bumps.  I&#x27;ve bought expensive treatments to slow hair loss, and I think this works as well or better for a fair price, and I know it is free of chemicals that I don&#x27;t understand.  Also, the smell is great for men and women.</li>
    <li> Very expensive for a tiny bottle of something that smells like dog shampoo and does not work at all. Bought it before I left for vacation and had it shipped to my destination. Tried returning it when I got home (3 days after the 30 day return policy), figured it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem since they had a 100% satisfaction guarantee, but was unable to contact the seller. Overall, it is so not worth it and I&#x27;ve never been so displeased with an Amazon purchase until I bought this.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this shampoo because I wanted to take an all natural approach to treating my problem scalp.I&lt;br /&gt;like the fact that the ingredients (Sage, Rosemary, Tea Tree, and Spikenard, etc) are all natural and pure.&lt;br /&gt;It moisturizes my hair and has a wonderful aroma. Overall this product has been very effective and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Although it&#x27;s on the pricier end of the spectrum, you get a lot of bang for your buck with this shampoo. I&#x27;ve only used this every other day for a week, but just a quarter size of the product gets you a long way. The smell is very pleasant and it makes for a pleasing shower experience. My scalp feels healthy, clean, and itch-free!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, it smells great and foams nicely compare to other natural shampoos. It&#x27;s my husband&#x27;s new favorite too:)&lt;br /&gt;Im not sure if it helps me with my dry scalp and dandruff.. Ill give it another couple of weeks and let you know, but overall its great!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing. I used it once it arrived in the mail (properly packaged too - no leaks!) and can already see it working. The smell is an added bonus too. I only just developed a dandruff problem in the last couple of months - probably due to weather changes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this shampoo fixed it all - i am no longer embarrassed to go out anymore  :)</li>
    <li> I am always wary of Amazon reviews and ratings as most of the times I feel the reviews are either written by bots, complimented by paid reviews or downgraded by competitors. However I decided to take the leap of faith with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I assure you, I am neither a bot nor a paid reviewer. I have used mainstream products for Anti-Dandruff and nothing ever works for more than two hours after a shower. It&#x27;s back to normal. This Shampoo, I could feel the difference after one wash. Still have flakes, but no where as close to as before, and this is a day after shampooing. I think it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also Sulphate free. I don&#x27;t know how much of an effect Sulphate has on my hair, and how much it is a marketing gimmick, but I have seen the detrimental effects of Sulphates when released into water, (Algae Blooms are caused by them), and hey, at least the satisfaction of, if not saving the environment, not harming it works as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Slightly on the higher side, and you can get it cheaper at their parent website. (Which sadly I knew only recently)</li>
    <li> This is a nice fragrance shampoo.  I have dandruff problem but have been using different shampoo to control dandruff.  I can say as of today, this does control dandruff.</li>
    <li> Dries hair and does nothing to the dandruff, waste product</li>
    <li> didnt help with dandruff at all, made my scalp very dry and was harsh on my dyed hair</li>
    <li> The product is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;No greasy feeling residue. Lot of suds. My scalp does feel less itchy.&lt;br /&gt;I am giving it 4 starts because the smell was a little too &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; for me. Very strong sage mint smell that I think I will get used to. Just a little shocking at first.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> As a shampoo, this stuff is amazing.  It shams and poos like a real pro.&lt;br /&gt;But don&#x27;t confuse this for an energy drink.  The taste you&#x27;ll get is called regret.</li>
    <li> I have developed a chemical sensitivity that causes symptoms like asthma, dizzyness, headache, nausea, hives and scalp psoraisis in reaction to exposure, making it pretty hard to navigate everyday life and the aisles of the basic super store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am SO happy to find this all-natural product.  It is great because it has no artifical fragrance or chemical ingredients to trigger or exacerbate the problem, AND it works so well to treat and heal my scalp.  It keeps my hair healthy and looking good, and being able to enjoy the plant-derived scent is an added perk.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t have to deal with dandruff, but come summer, my scalps starts to be all like &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t like you.&amp;#34; However, I fight back with this shampoo and my scalp has no chance to shed a single flake of dandruff.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work at all, don&#x27;t waste money.smells nice though. Back to drawing board. I hope I can find something that works!</li>
    <li> I decided to try this shampoo on the recommendation of a friend.  I really wanted a more natural and sulfate-free shampoo and am very pleased to have found this line.  After just a few days of use, my scalp has never felt so clean and itch free.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of the sage scent, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant.  The only thing I would say that keeps me from giving this a five star is that it leaves my hair feeling a bit course after taking a shower (I use Moroccan Oil to make it silky).  I would definitely recommend this to my friends.  I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the different products in this brand.</li>
    <li> After just a few uses it already made a difference. The smell is a little medicinal and not super pleasant but since it works I can tolerate it. I wash my hair at night and follow with conditioner and by the next day the smell is a little better.</li>
    <li> I have used this product only 2 times and my dandruff is already better than it has been in months using the other &amp;#34;leading brand of dandruff shampoo&amp;#34;.  It is a hard decision to spend the extra money for the natural/organic products, but this product is worth the money.  My itchy scalp is much better, and I hope after the next few washes that my dandruff problem will finally be resolved.  This shampoo has a good lather and a nice, clean, refreshing smell.  Glad I found this product!!</li>
    <li> Not much &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; about this, when you really read the (long, unpronounceable) ingredient list. Perhaps a few oils here and there make it &amp;#34;100% Natural&amp;#34;. Anyway, this harsh shampoo only made my scalp drier, itchier and flakier-WORSE than before I used it. So, I switch to this combo and am so happy as my scalp is almost 100% back to normal after only two washes (and my hair itself is not stripped completely and left &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; after washing). Here it is: Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Tea Tree Liquid Soap, followed by a rinse of water and Apple cider vinegar. That&#x27;s it. My scalp feels happy.</li>
    <li> I had heavy dandruff since middle school. I tried a lot of brand, such as Suave, Head&amp;Shoulders, Selsun, etc. They all did not work for me. I usually felt itchy one hour after washing my hair.  Only prescribed shampoo worked for me, but it cost a lot, about $50 for 4oz. Tried this product this morning, and felt very good till now. Not itchy and no dandruff for 12 hours so far. I&#x27;ll continue with it and come back to leave more comments a week later.</li>
    <li> I really love the smell and overall use of this product, however I did notice that I seemed to have more hair fallout while shampooing than I have with other shampoos.  I don&#x27;t believe it was too bad, but I wonder why this product would cause that to happen.  I have less dandruff problems now though!</li>
    <li> This product has worked really well on my dry scalp. The only other thing I&#x27;ve used that works as well is a prescription product. I really like the herbal smell, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: Use daily for a few days to get the flakes under control and then alternate with your regular shampoo. Also be aware that it acts as a clarifying shampoo as well, so condition well after use.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is just wonderful. I have been using it for almost two months now and it has improved the condition of my hair tremendously. After having a keratin treatement done I experienced hair loss and build up on my scalp. This shampoo was my solution. It has helped my hair grow again aswell as lessen the build up on my scalp. It is not completely cleared, however, it has improved dramatically. I love the smell and my hair is left very shiny and full of volume once i have just used it. The other great thing is that with a coconut oil treatment I do once a week on my hair and this shampoo, I no longer need to use conditioner. My hair is soft and no knots. I really think they use quality ingredients and that makes all the difference. We need more companies like this one, that offer quality products that actually do what the description says. Will be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> This is perfect because I had a bout of dandruff and I wouldn&#x27;t want a repeat of that.</li>
    <li> The best product I have used to date. Pros: Controls my dandruff and its all-natural. Con: MUST BE USED EVERY DAY. I found that if I did not use the product every day that my dandruff would come back with a vengeance. Overall, amazing product that I&#x27;ll recommend and keep using, but don&#x27;t skip a wash!</li>
    <li> Smell kind of Funny (not bad but not food either). It does take care a LITTLE bit of my dandruff but I still got a hitchy scalp and dandruff...</li>
    <li> After using this product ONCE at the suggestion of my brother-in-law who heard me complaining about a scales on my scalp, I noticed a big difference immediately and ordered my own bottle.  I&#x27;ve been using it most of the summer and it does a good job of getting rid of crusty scales, which mainly occur for me at the base of my scalp. I love that it&#x27;s sulfate free and you can feel it working by the scalp tingling.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I feel like it does dry out my hair a little, but not so much that I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. I recently realized my 10 year-old son had thick, sticky, waxy build-up on his scalp (think cradle cap). I was literally scraping it off with a fine-tooth comb and it still wasn&#x27;t coming off entirely. I convinced him to try this shampoo. I scrubbed it into the affected area, waited 2 minutes, rinsed and...IT WAS GONE! Even he was amazed! He gives it 5 stars! I will keep using this vs. store-brand due to the sulfate free option.</li>
    <li> My dandruff ain&#x27;t what they would call heavy, but I do want to get rid of it. Other brands just wont cut it. This is what I use and this is what works for me</li>
    <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t have all the harsh chemicals in it.  It cleans good and has a nice smell.  It wasn&#x27;t so much that I had dandruff, but my scalp would be so dry and I thot that was because of the main stream shampoos(which I stopped using about 3 yrs. ago).  I stopped coloring my hair 4 yrs. ago, so can&#x27;t blame it on that...anyway, I started using extra virgin coconut oil as a scalp conditioner, massaging into hair and scalp and leaving on for a good hr., then I shampoo.  It helps alot.  This shampoo is mild and again sans  sls/parabens/and any other harsh additives.</li>
    <li> My scalp had been flaking for a while and H&amp;S was no help whatsoever. I actually felt it dried out my scalp even worse. Less than a week or two went buy with the Maple Shampoo and almost all flaking is gone. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I have struggled for some time to find shampoos that are gentle enough for my very sensitive skin, but also treat and prevent the scabs and dandruff that form on my scalp (Just for reference, I have never had this skin disorder diagnosed, but psoriasis runs in my family). I have tried normal dandruff shampoos, which made the problem significantly worse and T-gel shampoo, which worked well. This is the third of several natural, sulfate free shampoos that I have used (the first to specify use for dandruff). So far, I love it! My scalp is not too dry or oily, and I have yet to experience scabbing. I would definitely recommend this product, though with its higher price tag, I have chosen to alternate it with a more inexpensive sulfate-free shampoo, with good results.</li>
    <li> This product worked on my dandruff within 2-3 days. Make sure you let it set for at least 2 minutes. Personally, the smell is not what I&#x27;m used to, but it does smell good and &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo once yesterday and it was good and my hair feels very silky . even though it has a strange smell but that is totally fine to me since it&#x27;s a chemical free shampoo</li>
    <li> It is difficult to find really good shampoos that work well in my thin hair, sensitive scalp, let alone has a pleasant smell. This one is one of those rare finds.</li>
    <li> It finally came in the mail (yay amazon prime!) I was eagerly waiting for it to come in the mail. Having suffered from seborrheic dermatitis my whole life, this shampoo managed to clear my scalp in one use! Some people commented on how it is a little drying for the hair, and I found that it is. So, I will take the helpful advice from other reviews and buy a natural conditioner to use with this. I have no complaints though. I&#x27;ve waited for this product practically my entire life!</li>
    <li> Very effective product, works exactly as claimed in treating dandruff problem. The results are observed very quickly in a few days.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has helped with my bad dandruff issues.  I use it as directed; two washes with 2-3 mins in between.  One time I massaged my scalp with it only once and there were still some flakes in my hair.  When I do it twice, dandruff control is much better.  It makes my hair shiny and soft.  I also like that it is not heavy on the chemicals.  Other dandruff shampoos have so many chemicals and make my hair fall out.&lt;br /&gt;So far satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have moderate dandruff and this has totally gotten rid of it. I use this everyday because it&#x27;s so gentle and leaves my hair soft and silky. I&#x27;m amazed that this product is not only natural and gentle, but by far the most effective dandruff shampoo I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s overall wonderful. Will absolutely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo several weeks ago, and have had excellent results. The Maple Holistics Sage Shampoo got rid of my itchy scalp from the very 1st. use. The appearance of my hair (being grey) is a lot shinier with greater fullness. With all of that said, what is really amazing, is that this is a very gentle, soothing product suitable for daily use. The herbal scent is very refreshing and an added delight.  I was fortunate to get exceptional support from one of their Customer Service Reps. Benjamin carefully reviewed all of Maple Holistics product line, and discussed the advantages/applications of each. Having retired from the Insurance Industry after a 34- year career as a Loss Control Ofc. and having evaluated numerous Personal Care product manufacturers, I can attest this is quality company. Furthermore, if you do an Internet Search for shampoos for dandruff and/or thinning hair, Maple Holistics keeps popping up and getting rave reviews by independent entities.  The amount of research that has gone into their Product Line is extrodinary. Even more amazing is how they are able to keep the price relatively low considering the organic and natural ingredients.  Bottom line, I rate the companies greatest strength in their Customer Service. Certainly everyone is different. But I realized early on Benjamin will not quit until a clients issues get resolved.</li>
    <li> I wanted this to work so bad! I tried this for about 2 weeks and it helped for about a week but then the flakes came back worse than before. :( oh well on to the next thing!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about two months now and it is amazing! I have suffered from severe dandruff &amp; caking on my scalp for several years now. So much so that I have had to use clobetasol steroid to keep it from bothering me to much. I wanted to find something natural to use instead and this sage shampoo is it! It controls the dandruff very well and the caking is almost gone!!!! I no longer use the steroid. My only complaint is the bottle leaks when I travel by air so I&#x27;ve started taping the lid shut and putting it a plastic bag. That seems to do the trick. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have severe dandruff for years and I have tried all the commercial shampoos, my dandruff has never stopped. With this product, I feel relieved, and it really works to control dandruff, it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a dandruff shampoo that didn&#x27;t have so many chemicals in it.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo does get the scalp really clean and has really helped my severe case of constant dandruff. Although, it hasn&#x27;t gone away 100% (again I have a severe case) it is definitely a product I will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> So I have not used the product for too long yet. I think I should give it some time.&lt;br /&gt;Hair type: Oily scalp, dry strands, super scanty hair!&lt;br /&gt;Dandruff type: Small flakes only in certain areas of the scalp&lt;br /&gt;- I do not use any styling product to be honest and have been struggling with dandruff since I-can&#x27;t-even-recall when! So I think it&#x27;s probably got something to do with my eating habits&lt;br /&gt;- I use this shampoo every other day since the time I purchased it, not sure if its working though, but will update after a few weeks if anything&lt;br /&gt;- Absolutely LOVE the aroma!</li>
    <li> I have been using this and it has gotten rid of my dandruff. I am just using this now because I got used to the smell.</li>
    <li> I have only use it four times and I have seen a huge improvement with my dandruff. 4 stars because It&#x27;s  a little expensive &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;</li>
    <li> I just using this for about a 2 weeks hair feels and looks great but not yet sure about the hair loss yet to early to tell but so far so good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had dandruff my whole life and have never found something that works as good as this stuff does for both dandruff and sensitive skin T-gel and head and shoulders don&#x27;t hold a candle to the Sage shampoo.</li>
    <li> I like it so far after two uses. I would recommend to those with flaky dry scalp.</li>
    <li> Works great for getting rid of the itch and flakes, and it smells so good.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that my hair seems thicker and less frizzy.</li>
    <li> I love that this is all natural.  It leaves my hair feeling really clean and light while also leaving my scalp feeling moisturized and healthy.  Plus it smells great!  I will definitely keep using this.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of using natural ingredients if they&#x27;re effective and leave my hair looking and feeling good. This product is okay but falls short in my opinion in all three of those aspects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive used both and find Jason Natural Products to be A LOT more effective in fighting dandruff and my scalp stays dandruff free with out  any itching or feeling of it coming back. In the case of the sage by the next morning I could feel the itch and dandruff begin to return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also and probably the biggest deal breaker my scalp felt tight like I had used a dandruff shampoo with Sage and my hair was less soft and manageable. Jason leaves my hair soft and really manageable. Im going back to Jason.</li>
    <li> After two washes my dandruff is almost gone! No other product has worked this well or this fast. I will definitely be re-purchasing! I personally don&#x27;t like the smell of sage, and the shampoo does smell strongly of it, but I&#x27;ll gladly take that over dandruff any day.</li>
    <li> This shampoo helped a little with dandruff, but my husband forbade me to use it ever again. He says he can&#x27;t stand smelling marijauna in my hair. Lol!! I think it was the sage scent. But I agree, it does smell like that, and that is not our life style so I didn&#x27;t want anyone else to smell that on me. I was quite embarrassed when he told me that.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works well, and doesn&#x27;t strip the color from my hair like regular dandruff shampoos do. Love the smell, too!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a little shy of 1 week, i have noticed my scalp less itchy and irritated.  I have also noticed slight improvements in my overall condition of seborrhea dermatitis. I see more flaking but my scalp seems a tad more clear. It seems the flaking is due to the clearing of my scalp. I am hoping with continued use my condition will be come more and more bearable maybe even cleared!&lt;br /&gt;I also love the smell of this shampoo, it&#x27;s not too strong and overwhelming like some in the past. I would highly recommend this to anyone at least to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I have dandruff and was tired of using Head &amp; Shoulders and still having an itchy scalp.  Not to mention that Procter and Gamble products are not made in an environmentally responsible way.  This shampoo smells good and leaves my short (now greying hair) pretty soft with a lot less itching than before.  I use it with a small scalp massage brush and comb it back after a lather and rinse it out several minutes later.  I&#x27;m going to buy again.</li>
    <li> I am using this product last two months and now my dandruff almost gone. It is not hard on your scalp and it won&#x27;t make your scalp dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you can see result from very wash itself. In all Maple Holistics product consistency is very good ,so you need to use very small amount to see the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with product and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot.</li>
    <li> Update 7/16/2014 - Now that I have tried out the Silk18 conditioner I need to rate the product a five star. Using the Shampoo and Conditioner my hair is amazing no dandruff and keeps my hair nice and soft. I love the fact I can leave my hair down and not worry about white flakes on my clothes. The shampoo and conditioner products are amazing. I will be a life time customer. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife shopped around for at least 8 months looking for a shampoo that would work on her dandruff. We went through at least 15 different products before coming across this one and it has made a huge difference. Her hair is finally dandruff free and looks amazing. The great part is it only took one treatment. We would have given it 5 stars but it left her hair a little dry and needs to be combined with a conditioner. The good news is I&#x27;ve heard this company is making a conditioner. I can&#x27;t wait!! If you are tired of looking around for a shampoo that actually works and isn&#x27;t full of chemicals then this is the one for you.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Unlike most shampoos available, this one is loaded with natural ingredients. It aims to treat rather than cover up. I really like the smell. It is earthy and not overbearing. It&#x27;s treated my dandruff and I feel no itching at all! The product comes in a sturdy, well packaged bottle. I am looking forward to purchasing more products from this store.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mother, who needed a shampoo for dandruff. Thanks to it, My mom now has wonderful hairs without problems. I will buy it again and again. She can&#x27;t wash her hairs without it!</li>
    <li> About the Product:&lt;br /&gt;It definitely has that sage and tea tree oil smell to it. I personally think it&#x27;s strong and not the best smelling shampoo, I&#x27;ve owned. My hair is almost down to my waist and I use about a nickle size amount. The bottle lasts around 2 months if you use it once every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I used it:&lt;br /&gt;At first, I would use a small amount and leave it on my hair for 3-5 minutes, as instructed, and rinse off. I follow up with my own conditioner. After two weeks, I noticed that my dandruff are less than what they used to be, but I still have them and my scalp is still itchy. I tried to follow the instructions, which is, leaving it on my hair for 3-5 minutes rinse and repeat. The second time that I applied the shampoo, it was way easier for it to foam and cover all over my hair. Not much lathering was needed. I did not notice a change in the amount of dandruff, however, my scalp is less itchy than before. I could go 2 days without washing before my scalp begins to itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who has dandruff that isn&#x27;t severe. I had dandruff for years, so it did not do much for me. For $17 dollars, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it for me personally. It does relives itching and decreased the amount of dandruff, but not completely get rid of it. It does dry your hair out if you use it twice as instructed.</li>
    <li> I have always suffered with embarrassing dandruff and like most of u tried every shampoo OTC. I have only used this product twice but after each shampoo I noticed a drastic reduction in the flakes ! It smells pleasant too :) will definitely purchase&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update : 2015 : it makes hair very brittle so I use it only once a week or so</li>
    <li> I have been using this product a couple of times. It does have a distinctive smell. So far I am not sure if it&#x27;s controlling my flakiness. I still have itching 48 hours after application. I will finish the bottle and see if I see any change in results. I am not sure if to control my flakiness I need to apply this every day or not.</li>
    <li> Shampoo is nice smelling and makes hair way too soft lol... but I see no improvement  not good for me but maybe for others..</li>
    <li> I have suffered from pretty severe dandruff for over 20 years now and I have tried just about every big name brand the stores have to offer. With little relief or only temporary relief from the big names I decided to do some online searching and ended up stumbling upon this Sage Shampoo from Maple Holistics. Based on the great reviews I had to give it a try. At first it did provide relief from the itching, but now after using it as directed every day for two weeks, my itchy scalp and flakes are back. While not as severe as when I use nothing, it still wasn&#x27;t the relief I&#x27;m looking for. I&#x27;m a little disappointed because of the high cost for this stuff, but who knows maybe it&#x27;s just my scalp. I will continue to use this product until I run out, because it&#x27;s just as good as any other shampoo I have used and I already paid for it, but I don&#x27;t see myself buying it again. It has an interesting herbal smell to it, but I do have to admit it&#x27;s a little nicer than some of the other medicated shampoo&#x27;s I have used.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this product and find the lack of the more aggressive chemical compounds refreshing. It was effective for me after about 4 uses.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally buy expensive hair products, but when I read the reviews and since it is made with only natural ingredients I was on board! Its simple, it cleans your hair so its literally squeaky clean, and the smell is very nice yet not too strong which I like, it isn&#x27;t overpowering, but is just right. The only drawback is the price, but you get what you pay for, if you want to continue to buy cheap products that give a temporary dandruff then go ahead, but you should defiantly try to check this product out!</li>
    <li> This product works really well for my hair. Whenever I wash my hair It lathers up nicely and has a nice fresh scent. It leaves my hair shiny and soft. I do however have to use this product every other day for my scalp to be clear of dandruff. I&#x27;ll continue to use it and hope that soon it solves my dandruff problem completely. All in all this is a good product and I definitely recommend this shampoo to anyone who has a problem with dandruff or itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> This shampoo really helped with my dandruff problem! I tried a few other brands of natural dandruff shampoo and the results were lacking. I noticed an improvement in the itchiness of my scalp and flakes after just a few uses. The shampoo suds up very well and makes my hair feel nice and clean. I enjoy the aroma of the shampoo as well.</li>
    <li> finally, the right combination of ingredients to lather up and eliminate my dreadful scalp condition. Product is amazing. and I am not a paid reviewer. This is the best I have tried.</li>
    <li> a very nice shampoo, indeed.  and a little goes a long way too.</li>
    <li> Not that crazy about this product, nor the smell of it. My daughters hair seems to be really oily the next day as if It wasn&#x27;t washed it at all. I&#x27;m catching her scratch her head just as much as if she didn&#x27;t use the product, but I know she has because I can smell it on her hair. In my opinion, it&#x27;s not the right product for my daughter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the past several months now, as directed, with no positive results.  I continued to give it a shot to no avail, so I decided to finally post this review. Given its positive reviews, it seems to work for some people, but not me.  I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a bad product, but it&#x27;s definitely not for all people with heavy dandruff.</li>
    <li> Background: I spent a lot of time traveling through India and Nepal last year and my hair got pretty gross and I started having dandruff problems that did not go away once I returned to the States. I tried some fancy shampoo that did nothing so I set out to look for something natural and I thought I&#x27;d give the Sage Shampoo a try.&lt;br /&gt;About my hair: I have long blonde hair and a lot of it. I wash about every third day (two to three times a week)&lt;br /&gt;About the product: I read that the Sage Shampoo did not lather well, but I strongly disagree. This shampoo lathers better than any shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used, and I use to buy high-end, fancy shampoo. You really only need a little. I received this bottle the first week of January and still have a third of the bottle left. This shampoo hasn&#x27;t completely cured my scalp but it&#x27;s helped alleviate the problem quite a bit. I think I would have more success if I washed my hair with the Sage Shampoo daily, but I can&#x27;t be bothered. It would be awesome if Maple Holistics could create a dry shampoo that had dandruff curing properties to use in between washings!&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I really love this product and am more than happy to support a company that values customers and makes good quality natural products.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Maple Holistics!</li>
    <li> I have never had that much dandruff before this year.  I have tried almost everything, from Selson blue,etc. and nothing seemed worked.  I am so glad that I researched on Amazon and found this product and decided to give it a try.  It is the best shampoo and it WORKS and all natural.  Now this is the only shampoo that I use.  My husband also has seborrhoeic dermatitis and he is using and loving it as well.  I have recommended to a few of my friends as well.</li>
    <li> I have tried every dandruff solution out there - Kenra, Pureology, Selsun Blue, Head and Shoulders, you name it! While they all worked for a couple of days, my dandruff always came right back the next day. It got to the point where I had to use it every day, and that can&#x27;t be healthy for anyone&#x27;s scalp. My scalp always felt extremely dry after using all of this products, and I was about ready to give up until I saw this stuff. I&#x27;m a huge fan of natural skin and hair care products, but I still do use expensive salon brands on occasion. For shampoo however, this is all I use. I really hope this product never gets discontinued or I will be out of luck, because it&#x27;s literally the ONLY dandruff shampoo that works. My scalp never has that overdry feeling after I shower, and I see virutally no flakes and no itchiness! Thank you so much for making a safe, effective product. My hair is super shiny and happy now. :)</li>
    <li> For a long time I was mostly using Head and Shoulder but wanted to try a sulfate free shampoo.  After reading a lot of reviews on different sulfate free shampoos I decided to give this one a try. I have been using this shampoo for about a month.  So far so good.  The shampoo cleans my hair just as good as other shampoos but it doesn&#x27;t leave my scalp as dry.  I tried a different sulfate-free shampoo but I still had a problem with dandruff.  So far I have not experience any dandruff problems since using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that could be better is the smell of the shampoo. I expected that since it is made from Tea Tree oil.  However it don&#x27;t leave a lingering smell in your hair after you was it out.</li>
    <li> bought this shampoo for my boyfriend to finally get rid of his dandruff...although he wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the smell, we definitely began seeing results within about 3 weeks!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different shampoos, and this is my favorite so far. This shampoo is sulfate free. The price is a little high, however, I think it&#x27;s worth it. Compared to the Soap Nuts shampoo, this one has been less drying for me.  I have seborrheic dermatitis and find that this shampoo mostly resolves the itchy scalp that I sometimes get. The anti-dandruff properties also appear to be as advertised. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it and will continue to purchase more. I noticed that they also sell conditioner through their website that I would like to try, however I don&#x27;t see it offered here at the moment.</li>
    <li> I have struggled since I was young with recurring seborrhic dermatitis on my scalp. For years I bounced between expensive (and harsh) prescriptions, and stinky, or just plain ineffective over the counter shampoos.  A couple of years ago I discovered the magic of tea tree oil and it&#x27;s ability to clear up my scalp.  I now use a locally made tea-tree oil mixture once every two weeks as a deep treatment but then began the search for a shampoo that also contained tea tree.  After trying quite a few, I stumbled upon the great reviews of this sage shampoo (ohmygoodness the amazing smell is an extra added bonus!).  After using it for 2+ months I can attest that it is the best one I&#x27;ve used, and am happy to say I have finally achieved the perfect regimen to keep my scalp itch and flake free.  (I use this every other day, and gently massage it into my scalp with a brush before letting it sit for 5 minutes).  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product, company, and will undoubtedly be a lifelong customer.</li>
    <li> I have always had very dry hair and flaky scalp. I used this shampoo when visiting my sister, was thrilled with how my hair and scalp felt after use and immediately ordered two bottles as soon as I got home. I highly recommend this product to anyone experiencing dryness, dandruff, or other persistent scalp problems.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair and have been looking for a natural solution for dermatitis of the scalp.  So far THIS WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is this is a small bottle and it is extremely pricey.  Long hair &#x3D; using up the product really quick.  :(&lt;br /&gt;I would need two bottles a month &#x3D; $40 supply each month!!  :(  Need to buy in bulk somehow.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST shampoo out there for anyone suffering from dandruff, dry scalp, etc.  I have tried so many other shampoos, recommended by friends, hair dressers, pharmacists, etc.  Not one of these products ever worked as well as this shampoo did in just one use! My scalp is not dry or itchy, my hair is not oily, but feels clean, and it has been three days since I washed my hair! I love the scent, and how rich the suds are with such a small amount of shampoo. Yes, directions ask for two washes per use, but the amount of shampoo used even with a double dose is smaller than one dose fir other shampoos. It is worth the cost!</li>
    <li> This is a great cleanser for hair AND scalp. I purchased it to try to calm down scalp itching and dryness. It works wonderfully. My hair is thick and long and tangles so I do wish Maple Organics had a similar \\&quot;solution\\&quot; for a detangling conditioner. But this product has a great scent, and works really well.  Alhough it may seem pricey, a tiny amount cleans thoroughly. I will be trying other Maple Organics products as the need arises.</li>
    <li> This product works really well for my dry scalp and is non-irritating to my dermatological issues. It does not dry out my hair. The smell is not the best but also not the worst.</li>
    <li> This product makes me satisfied. My hair is quite smooth and has the cosy smell which lasts 6-7 hours. I also love this product which makes me confidence and attractive  because it captures my friends attention, they ask me how beautiful my hair is. I am happy to share their my experience. It&#x27;s so wonderful the feeling of sharing.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. Smells amazing and leaves you hair feeling super clean. Sometimes it feels like other products leave a residue that builds up after each wash; especially some of the more “moisturizing” types. I feel like this product does an amazing job of removing any residue left by other products. It leaves your hair feeling less weighed down/limp without drying the strands out. My favorite shampoo!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have a dandruff problem, but also color my hair.  So I wanted something natural so my color would not turn.  Fortunately, it maintained my color, but did not control my dandruff problem.  Won&#x27;t bother buying this again.</li>
    <li> I like the smell. It was not effective on my scalp. However, the flakes on my scalp are pretty stubborn.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times now, but I love it already! So far, I&#x27;ve had no dandruff issues. It&#x27;s sulfate free, and it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is awesome. After the first two uses I stopped having an itchy scalp completely. It also helped with my dandruff. Before trying this shampoo I&#x27;ve tried so many other products. Even tea tree shampoo and it didn&#x27;t work. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I honestly noticed a difference after just one use. Flakes were never a problem for me until I used a certain shampoo which shall remain nameless, but no matter which shampoo I switched back to, they wouldn&#x27;t go away. So I went on a long search for an SLS-free shampoo and stumbled upon the Sage Shampoo. After the first wash with Maple Holistics though, I had significantly less flakes and my scalp stopped itching immediately. After a week and a half? I have no flakes, my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch and my hair is way softer than it has ever been, and I don&#x27;t even use their conditioner... yet.</li>
    <li> Great product. For some odd reason after a foot surgery I had, my scalp became itchy and I started having dandruff. Perhaps the meds I was on or something. I had a Keratin treatment a month or so before the surgery and did not want to use a shampoo that would strip the Keratin. Keratin treatments are pricey and easily undone without careful selection of shampoo. I found Sage online and was skeptical that it would help with the severe dandruff, worried that it would strip the Keratin and/or color and figured at best it would take many days of shampooing with it to get relief. After only one shampoo my scalp felt better, after two no dandruff or itching. No damage to Keratin treatment or to color treatment. I highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> This product does wonders to my hear. It removes dandruff and it leaves my hear relaxes, smelling clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I have been using it once a week for the last couple of months and I have seen a huge improvement with my dandruff.I gave 4 stars because of price. I am about to order again as soon as I finish write this review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a few weeks and it works as advertised. My dandruff not only disappeared after 3 treatments, but my scalp feels amazing and looks very healthy.&lt;br /&gt;If you’re tired of looking for a shampoo that is not full of chemicals and actually works, then this is the one.</li>
    <li> Does not work as well as Head and Shoulders (I use the generic H&amp;S).&lt;br /&gt;Works a bit to relieve itching,&lt;br /&gt;but I&#x27;m still left with lots of flakes after getting out of the shower.</li>
    <li> Background:  I&#x27;ve been using various dandruff shampoos for over a year now to try and tame my itchy, oily, uncomfortable and (frankly) ugly scalp issues with limited success.  I have chest-length dark wavy hair and the yellowy/white waxy dandruff, bumps and constant itchiness were really doing a number on my self-esteem while the Rx (ketoconazole 2%) and drugstore options (head &amp; shoulders, neutrogena t-sal, selsun blue naturals, nizoral a-d) were doing a number on my hair and helping, but not getting rid of my scalp issues.  Even with huge amounts of conditioning even during shampooing, my ends were getting really dry, split and battered from the very harsh shampoo and I wanted to try something without all the detergents.  I&#x27;d love to be able to dye my hair again without having dandruff shampoos strip the color right back out.    Pros of this product:  I like that they&#x27;re very clear what ingredients are for which purpose and the lack of harsh surfactants (detergents), my hair is left very shiny, soft and bouncy after washing and it doesn&#x27;t seem to mess with my curl pattern or to dry out my ends.  The itching is cut down considerably the day of shampooing and well into the day after, which is a huge win for me since even right after shampooing with the very strong Rx shampoo, my head would still be itchy right after the shower.  I&#x27;ve seen a decrease in my dandruff and I feel like there might be fewer bumps but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks.    Cons:  Price is much higher than I&#x27;m used to spending for shampoo but my options are limited if I want a dandruff shampoo that I can use once I color my hair.  I understand that the ingredients aren&#x27;t cheap, but do look at the Oz size so you&#x27;re not surprised by the size of the bottle when it arrives.  I&#x27;m considering shampooing with another mild, cheap shampoo first and then following with this one to see if I can get the same benefit without using as much product but if that doesn&#x27;t work then I&#x27;ll deal with the price since it helps my itchiness and won&#x27;t strip color.  The smell is strong and isn&#x27;t my taste.  It is very earthy, herbal and almost tea-like and I can put up with it since I&#x27;m pretty sure it comes with the ingredients and isn&#x27;t just an added fragrance.  It&#x27;s very strong when you&#x27;re in the shower and does linger in dry hair more than I&#x27;d like.    Overall:  Worth a shot for those who are tired of the drugstore options and looking for something less harsh but still effective.  Awesome for those who like earthy/spicy scents and workable for those who don&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ll see if it keeps delivering once I dye my hair again but based on my experience so far, I think it&#x27;s gentle enough that it&#x27;ll work well and I plan to repurchase when I run out.    EDITED TO ADDRESS HAIR DYE COLOR ISSUE 1/10/15:  So I bumped this down a star because it is not as color safe as I was hoping it&#x27;d be.  I dye my brown hair a deep red and although reds are known to fade fast, it definitely strips more color from my hair than a regular sulfate-free shampoo does.  Salon color is not cheap and it fading even faster than usual is really not okay with me.  Part of the stripping may be due to the fact that the directions have you leave it on your scalp for a while in the shower, but I think even double washing with a very mild shampoo is probably better for my color than using this shampoo.  I used a full bottle and was partway into my second bottle when my stylist mentioned that my color was way more faded than it should be if I was using a sulfate-free shampoo.  I&#x27;m leaving 4 stars because it&#x27;s a good product otherwise, but proceed with caution or use rarely with dyed hair.</li>
    <li> fresh smell, good large bottle. Not going to spend a fortune on hair-washing, so this is ideal.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an OK product, because the scent and cleansing properties were average and fell short of my expectations. I will not buy buy the product again..</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a big dandruff problem, but I noticed a bit of flaking a couple of weeks ago. I tried head aNd shoulders which helped, but did not resolve the problem. Unfortunately the drug store has a limited dandruff shampoo selection so I turned to AMAZON! I decided to try Maple Holistics Sage Shampoo because of the reviews and I&#x27;m glad I did! my hair already feels and looks healthier after 1 wash! It is a bit pricier than drugstore brands but it&#x27;s natural and it works so this is a keeper for me!</li>
    <li> I try to buy natural and organic products, but it&#x27;s hard to not be disappointed sometimes. I had high hopes for this one. The sage shampoo sure smells nice and it definitely does work against dandruff, but that&#x27;s where the benefits end for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing my hair with this, it feels hard and doesn&#x27;t have the smooth and silky feeling I expect from clean hair. I feel like I need to wash it again at the end of the day, even though with other products washing it a couple of times a week is sufficient for me. I didn&#x27;t notice this at first and was all happy and proud of myself for using organic shampoo until I stayed in a hotel where they only had your generic Head &amp; Shoulders kind of stuff. After using that, my hair felt so amazing all day that it kind of made me sad. I hope this works better for other people.</li>
    <li> I just bought my second bottle of Sage, and have been very happy with the first one. I have extreme dandruff, and have tried several others but nothing worked too well. Sage does not remove my dandruff completely, however, the flakes are much smaller and less in quantity, and it doesn&#x27;t have any harmful ingredients of many other shampoos. Thus, it does not cause hair fall like some other shampoos I tried. The best thing is that I don&#x27;t have to use a conditioner separately, as my hair (mens short) is pretty well conditioned with just this shampoo, and it also has a pleasant smell. I use Nizoral occasionally, which is stronger for dandruff but has more harmful ingredients, when I really need to reduce dandruff totally for a day, but it does not leave the hair feeling smooth. I have found my perfect balance in Sage, after looking for a long time.</li>
    <li> It really works. Use it 2 times a week.</li>
    <li> My hair is super thin, super oily and super dry scalp and it tends to fall out a lot.  I really don&#x27;t like it. I was using another shampoo to prevent hair fall out which it did but wasn&#x27;t doing anything to control the oil and my scalp was so itchy even right after washing it and the next day you can see flakes coming off my scalp. It itches so much that I would break open the skin scratching. I came across this shampoo and brought it. I have using it for about 3 weeks now and here&#x27;s what I see I need to wash my hair every 2 days because of the oil. The tightness and dryness in my scalp are gone and flakes as well. If I decide to be lazy and not wash my hair on the 2nd day and put it up in a ponytail then my scalp starts to itch so every 2 days it is. As far as my hair falling out I noticed by the second week that even though I&#x27;m still losing a few strands it&#x27;s no where near what usually falls out. My hair feels super soft and it looks healthy I put some mousse in it blow dry it and it does have body in it. I love the earthy clean smell of the shampoo it lasts the whole day. I will continue using this it is definitely worth the $$. I&#x27;m only sorry I didn&#x27;t find it sooner would have saved me some embarrassing days.</li>
    <li> The delivery was quick. It was the first time I used an anti-dandruff product, and, honestly, I was impressed. As bad as I imagined the dandruff problem is hard to get rid off, after the second time washing my hair with the shampoo, I had significantly less dandruff, and after the fifth time, it was completely gone! So now I can wear black clothes without worrying too much.</li>
    <li> I actually have oily hair with dry scalp that can flake especially during the winter. With this kind of combination either shampoo can leave my hair to moisturized meaning it gets oily quicker or leaves it to dry causing split ends and drier scalp. This shampoo is a happy in between. I shower once a day and scalp is flake free, not itchy, hair is soft, manageable, but not to moisturized, not to dried out. I personally only need a quarter size amount, I shampoo and let it sit long enough to brush my teeth (yes I know I&#x27;m weird for brushing my teeth in the shower) and rinse. I don&#x27;t feel like I have to repeat wash which with other shampoos I sometimes feel like I have to because of the type hair I have. Also it smells good not like dandruff shampoo at all which is a nice plus. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and it really does work. A lot of reviews said that after one use they could tell a difference. I thought this was too good to be true so I tempered my expectations. But after one use I could tell an immediate and dramatic difference. This shampoo is worth the money!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. I thought it was the frist week or so but I was wrong I started to flake very bad. And the bottle is so small for the price. No good</li>
    <li> My wife and I use alot of different shampoo before.  And we finally found the one that we love.  I had dandruff problem before we use this shampoo.  Specially when I wear black color clothing.  After we use this shampoo, my dandruff problem does improve a lot.  Even my wife is a very picky person.  She love the smell and she feel clean after using this shampoo.  We definite recommend all my friends and family about this item.  And now we are trying other products from this company.  Thank you for putting your product on Amazon.</li>
    <li> First if all this stuff smells awful even when you wash your hair with it and then try to get the smell out by using conditioner it doesn&#x27;t go away! All day I smelled this awful cr@p in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Second if all it did nothing for my hair. It didn&#x27;t make it softer, or smoother or anything it just smelled bad.</li>
    <li> It works. Those two words are simple but for any psoriasis patient all that is necessary. Like all patients I have tried scores of shampoos. Sage doesn&#x27;t cure, HOWEVER, it does a good job of managing symptoms and keeping my scalp under control as it significantly reduces symptoms. I have used it for 2 weeks and it does well cleaning hair and scalp and reducing any psoriasis buildup.Sage doesn&#x27;t have any harsh or overbearing smell as  other medicated scalp shampoos.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing. I noticed a rapid decrease in the amount of dandruff I had. I highly recommend this product! Great seller and quick shipping! Highly trusted!</li>
    <li> Love this product. I&#x27;ve been struggling with severe dandruff for years. I have long color treated hair and I&#x27;ve tried everything from vinegar to tea tree oil to head and shoulders (which tried my hair out something awful). My hair looks amazing and my dandruff is rapidly getting better! Very excited to try other products from this company!</li>
    <li> The smell is the same as a shampoo I once used on my dog and it does nothing for my hair other than make me smell like a forest all day.</li>
    <li> For my hair, it worked great. For my scalp, it was not as good as some other dandruff shampoos that I have used. I love that it is all natural, though. The price was too much for the amount as well.</li>
    <li> Works as promised. This shampoo really makes a difference for dandruff. The scent is wonderful of healthy sage. Lathers well with only a small amount of product needed.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in less than a week!  I had terrible dandruff. It was hard to find a product that was sulfate free and helped to heal dandruff, without leaving an annoying residue in my hair. This product exceeded my expectations. Plus, you really only need a pea size amount - so this product will last longer than most commercial shampoos of the same size.</li>
    <li> Real organic product!! Not just an advertise. I really loved it.</li>
    <li> very refreshing on my scalp and it reduced my dandruff after just one wash(not completely gone though)! so glad i purchased this!</li>
    <li> Awesome product and awesome customer service! The dermatologist gave me stuff that made my dandruff worse. Seriously, if you have a severe itchy scalp and dandruff and have tried literally everything give this a try. I realized I have to do EXACTLY what the bottle says ( wash and let it sit for a couple of mins and rinse and repeat) and I have to use it every night or I notice the flakes coming back. But I will take washing my hair twice a night over the embarrassment of horrible white flakes on my dark hair any day!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have dandruff but I do get scalp build-up pretty bad. I have a lot of long hair, not at all oily, and wash only twice a week.  I have tried numerous shampoos to address the build-up.  This shampoo seems to be the ticket for me. I&#x27;ve used it twice now and for the first time in a long time, zero build-up between washings. I&#x27;m very satisfied and will continue to use this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Just received my bottle of Sage Shampoo. The smell isn&#x27;t like some fancy shmancy salon smell; you can smell the herbs. Have washed my hair twice with it and I can already tell a difference in my hair. I&#x27;m 28 and suffer from some narly scalp issues. Clunky, dead, skin often follows my normal washes and so far this product has eliminated that. My hair smells surprisingly clean, despite the herbal smell of the shampoo itself. Super impressed thus far. Will be ordering more products from this company.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal! After years of playing the &#x27;switch-em-up&#x27; game with traditional dandruff shampoos, I was recommended this product by hair dresser in the family. I have used the sage shampoo nearly every shower I&#x27;ve taken since April (it&#x27;s now December) and can attest to how well it helps my flakey condition in both hot and cold weather...wearing dark clothing is no longer a scary experience! The best part is that it&#x27;s natural and my scalp simply &#x27;feels better&#x27;. I love too that the scent is clean and not over powering. Overall great product and a must try for those who are tired of the big 3 (head/shoulder, selsun blue, t-gel) and want to try something holistic.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for almost a year now. I have really bad dandruff and I read the description for it and thought I would give a try. I have gone to a dermatologist and she wanted me to use some medicated shampoo which I was against and also some sort of topical steroid solution. I used a steroid cream. None of those worked and the solution blistered my scalp because I used it too much. So I gave this a shot and I must say it works. I haven&#x27;t had any issues since using this and my scalp looks really clean afterward. I say forget the dermatologists medication and try this. but also what else helps me is that I use JBCO Red Pimento oil on my scalp. That oil is for dandruff also and it works wonderful too. So combine the two and your flake problem will go away. I also love the smell of it. It always reminds me of walking into one those metaphysical shops. It&#x27;s really thick and lathers well. Overall I like it and I do plan on trying other shampoos by this company. It&#x27;s really expensive though.</li>
    <li> It seemed to make my dandruff even worse. Has nice smell but didn&#x27;t seem to work for me.</li>
    <li> I received my Maple Holistics sage shampoo 5 days ago and I love it already! I have had dandruff issues since I can remember and I have tried so many different products and was not satisfied. This shampoo gave me immediate results! It not only soothed my scalp, but also soothed my senses with its wonderful, natural fragrance! Love it!</li>
    <li> I was holding high expectations for this product especially since it has no sulfates, but it did not work and only left my  scalp feeling irritated . I stopped using after using it three times. I bought T/Gel therapeutic shampoo at Ralph&#x27;s market and after using twice, the problem cleared up, at half the price.</li>
    <li> I had long time looking for a shampoo for scalp irritation and dandruff, but always found them full of chemicals that made my condition worse, until I found this spectacular natural shampoo that is gentle on my hair and leave me a delicious herbal aroma and of course my scalp is healthier than ever.</li>
    <li> While I don&#x27;t suffer from dandruff, I was looking for a product with superb scalp-cleaning power. Sage Shampoo definitely delivers. My scalp is healthy, my hair shiny. I&#x27;m really liking this shampoo--I use it in conjunction with Maple Holistics Silk Conditioner. I could not be happier with the health and look of both hair and scalp. And the scent...oh, my goodness!</li>
    <li> I have terrible dandruff. But, i also spend alot of money dying my hair a deep burgundy which is already apt to fade quickly. So i had been dealing with the dandruff because all the dandruff shampoos at stores (even salons!) have sulfate in it!!! Even Matrix &#x27;s dandruff shampoo has sulfate! So when i found this shampoo, i saw it was sulfate free, i watched a girl on youtube give a review, and it was good, so i ordered it. And, in a week i already noticed a difference in my dandruff without my color fading!! I&#x27;m really impressed with this shampoo. And the fact that its all natural is just a bonus, cuz honestly i wouldnt care either way. All i really care about is the fact that it doesnt have sulfate in it. But since they made the formula all natural, i suppose its best not to put more chemicals! So, i definitely reccommend this to anyone with dandruff!!! And colored hair. And i havent tried any of their other products, but i&#x27;m willing to bet they work amazing.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve had sebhorreic dermatitis for about 8 years. I have tried everything over the counter...along with topical steroids prescribed by a dermatologist. I&#x27;ve tried turmeric, apple cider vinegar you name it. Yes maybe a few products got rid of the itching for an hour...but sure enough I still had hundreds of flakes and a scalp that itched so bad it would bleed..i came across the sage shampoo while searching amazon and without hesitation ordered it due to the amazing reviews. After the first use my hair smelled great and felt soothed. No itching at all! I think due to it being sulfate free. I&#x27;ve only used it once but can tell I&#x27;m going to stock up 😊</li>
    <li> Left my hair very brittle, didn&#x27;t seem to do much for dandruff either. Can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Seems like it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> I would buy this again but so thick it plugs up the cap. Had to uncap &amp; unplug it once and only 1/4 gone. I did like the smell but make sure you know the smell of Spikenard  &amp; Sage before buying, it is a bit strong.  Awesome shampoo otherwise.</li>
    <li> Nice product, didn&#x27;t help with my dandruff.  Will keep searching!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. I just started using this shampoo, and it works. I love the smell of my hair after I use it. I was doubting about buying this shampoo, but now that I have tried it, I really recommend it to anyone with dandruff issues.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this conditioner. It has made my hair so much more manageable in terms of smoother and less tangled. I have curly frizzy hair, and it&#x27;s been increasingly difficult to manage the tangles after I wash my hair. I also purchased the sage shampoo which is cleansing but not harsh on my color treated hair!</li>
    <li> I removed SLS and silicones from my hairs diet a year ago and even though the overall condition and health of my hair has improved my scalp issues are just as irritating as ever.  I find the smell of this tolerable which is more then I can say for most natural dandruff shampoos. I don&#x27;t love it but it doesn&#x27;t bother me when I smell it throughout the day. It has a nice rich lather for no SLS which makes me think more of the active compounds are getting into my scalp. I have been used it several times and I haven&#x27;t seen a huge improvement but I can say my scalp is not as itchy which is a relief. Since I like the smell better then most I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month now and still have dandruff. I am now looking for an alternative.</li>
    <li> Expensive but works well.</li>
    <li> Nice product ! I always have dandruff and i used a lot of shampoos to solve it and no results appear.. When i used this shampoo for this brand i felt better because now my hair becames smooth and without dandruff.. i will continue use this product because the results are there.. I can recomend this product to the people who have the same problem that me..</li>
    <li> sulfate free dandruff shampoos are rare to find, I had to do a lot of research to find this product and I am absolutely in love of how clear my hair is after using it, as well as resolving the bad scalp itching. I am happy with my purchase and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with all of the organic and pure ingredients in the product.  I have bad dandruff, and I definitely think this shampoo is helping clear that up!  I have only had it for a few days as well!</li>
    <li> My sister had some dandruff problem and I found this shampoo online. I decided to give it a try and buy one for her. The shampoo works great. My sister now has silky smooth hair thanks to this shampoo. Her dandruff problems are also gone after just 2 weeks of using the shampoo.I will be making another order soon so that this shampoo will be our official house shampoo</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my son for his Dandruff after trying many other products.  This is the first time he asked me to buy more.  His hair is soft and this really does the trick.  I am also glad that it is free from all the harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> I see good reviews for this product but I guess this product works differently on each people, for me it didn&#x27;t work. I have been using this shampoo for last 2-3 months but I didn&#x27;t see any changes. Though this shampoo smells good and fresh but besides that its not a miracle product.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo, gently cleanses my scalp without stripping my locks.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo because it didn&#x27;t strip my hair of it&#x27;s natural oils and leave it all dry, stringy and weird like other anti dandruff shampoos but the dandruff didn&#x27;t subside completely. It really does reduce the amount of dandruff IF USED CONSISTENTLY. You must use this shampoo at least twice a week to notice reduction of dandruff. If it wasn&#x27;t so pricey, I would repurchase again. A little goes a long way so the bottle can defiantly last a good amount of time. It also makes your hair actually feel clean since it is more of a cleanser. Good product, definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as great as many other Dandruff shampoos. Also wasn&#x27;t expected to smell like a hippy when using this.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo for my daughter. She&#x27;s 5 with curly hair that&#x27;s very fine. I can&#x27;t comb through her hair well, and lots of conditioning had left a coat on her scalp that was itching her. Literally, after 1 wash with this shampoo (I left it on her scalp for a few minutes as per instructions), the dandruff and dry, scaly skin was gone. Also, my husband and I love the way her hair smells. I still have to use a heavy conditioner on her curls, but I love using this shampoo as a way to get build up off and relieve the itchiness on her scalp. I&#x27;m using the shampoo regularly on her hair (I wash it about twice a week) to maintain good scalp health. It&#x27;s super gentle on her fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;I used the shampoo myself, and I loved it. I have hair that&#x27;s slightly dried and damaged from years of coloring. As I&#x27;m a stay-at-home-mom right now, I only wash my hair about once or twice a week in winter. I don&#x27;t have over oily hair, but I do get some oiliness between washes now.  This shampoo removes that oil and leaves my somewhat thin hair feeling full and thick - I LOVE that. It&#x27;s even better than shampoos designed to add body and bounce. I still have to use a conditioner on my hair -esp the ends, but with this shampoo, I don&#x27;t add a conditioner up near my scalp or roots! Love that.</li>
    <li> It smells great, but the shampoo doesn&#x27;t work. Neither the itch nor the flakes were gone. Overpaid for a lost cause. :(</li>
    <li> This product is great. I like the smell of it. It makes your hair very soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I had severe flaking and itchy scalp. Have tried several shampoos like Head &amp; Shoulders, Nizoral Blue . Nothing seemed to work. And upon doing a lot of research gave this a try and glad I did . I have used three times so far, flaking has reduced drastically and no more itching. The smell is pretty strong but I like it.</li>
    <li> I tried a lot of different dandruff shampoos but none of them have worked as good as Sage Shampoo after one use so far my head itches a lot less than it did using any of those other kinds of shampoo that I have used in the past make sure to follow the directions on the bottle would highly recommend this product for anyone that wants to get rid of their dandruff    update:  worked pretty good for a few days but now its been a few weeks and it don&#x27;t really seem to be helping with my itchiness or my oily scalp works about the same as any other shampoo it would probably work well for someone with dry dandruff though</li>
    <li> It was too harsh for my hair. I dried my scalp out.</li>
    <li> Wow, this is the first thing I&#x27;ve used in years of fighting stubborn dandruff that has worked great, not just good.</li>
    <li> I just started having dandruff and did not want to use one of those smelly, chemical ridden shampoos to get rid of it.  I tried Sage Shampoo for Heavy Dandruff based on other reviews and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I noticed a difference with the very first shampoo!  This shampoo smells terrific and lathers like crazy.  It has been about a week since I&#x27;ve been using it and I&#x27;m happy to report no more dandruff.  I highly recommend this shampoo to get rid of dandruff!!!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a natural sulfate-free shampoo to treat my dry scalp.  I was hesitant to try this one because the price seemed high, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.  It keeps my scalp healthy and flake free, and it smells wonderful.  I use it about every other time I wash my hair.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is fantastic-the scent and the texture of it are very pleasant. My scalp feels so much better-used to be embarrassingly flaky and constantly itchy, but now it doesn&#x27;t shed  all over my clothes or the furniture I sit on. This shampoo is fairly expensive, but not a whole lot is needed, so I feel it&#x27;s worth every penny. I will buy this again and again. The fact that it is all natural is important to me, too. The packaging wasn&#x27;t very sturdy and the top was a bit cracked, but very little shampoo escaped. The packaging is all I am unhappy with.</li>
    <li> Its not a miracle cure, but it works quite well without harsh chemicals, and does not damage my color treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: use a scalp brush such as this: http://www.amazon.com/Scalpmaster-Shampoo-Brush-printed-poly/dp/B000NJG82W/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1394425443&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1 to really work it into your scalp, then leave it on a few minutes before rinsing.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works... it cleans my scalp which is great, however when I massage my scalp it tends to make my hair knotted. Luckily I follow with a great conditioner, so I comb through slowly in the shower and it&#x27;s all good.</li>
    <li> For a while, I thought I had dandruff, so I decided to use a chemical-free shampoo for dandruff and chose Sage. I really like it and am now realizing that while I did not have dandruff, just dry skin from chemicals, I do love this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this bottle until its gone. I&#x27;ll then buy another shampoo from Maple Holistics! Can&#x27;t wait to try a new one!</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo after using the Maple Holistics Tea Tree Oil Shampoo. Both of these products are wonderful. I purchased them because they do not contain sulfates and this was very important to my health. What I got was wonderful shampoos that cleaned my hair gently and left it feeling very soft but not greasy and helped my scalp immensely with no itchy dryness. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> My bf definitely has seborrheic dermatitis and has lots of flakes in his black hair that is really noticeable. I don&#x27;t really like him using H&amp;S everyday because I think it&#x27;s a bit too strong and makes your hair fall out. I saw reviews for this natural shampoo and bought it for him. The bottle is pretty pricey, considering its size, but his hair smells really &amp;#34;herby&amp;#34; and nice after he showers, and he says it also feels great on his scalp. I have to say, though, that I don&#x27;t think it works as well as H&amp;S in controlling dandruff because he still has a lot of flakes. Maybe it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s the winter, so it&#x27;s dry and worse during this season, but I would not say this is for heavy dandruff control. It&#x27;s just a natural shampoo that smells good, and if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, then this is fine. If you need to get rid of your dandruff, I would pass on this.</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo. It has helped regulate my oily scalp and buildup. It smells nice and has been safe to use daily. I would definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about this shampoo, but I haven&#x27;t had any dandruff issues since I started using it back in July. Additionally, friends and family have been complimenting me about how great my hair smells!</li>
    <li> I have dry scalp, not dandruff, so I was a little leary of this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it every other day for 2 months.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s working as promised.  Some days I notice improvement, but other days it seems the same.  I use a shampoo scalp massage brush with this to make sure it penetrates the scalp.  I&#x27;ve also noticed some hair loss, but not sure if it&#x27;s related to this product.  So with two months use, I cannot confidently state that this works.</li>
    <li> This product impressed me right from the start.  I have thin waist length hair with oily itchy scalp.  I used a small dollop of shampoo and it worked up to a thick luxurious lather.  It rinses out squeeky clean.  My scalp feels calmer and I have high hopes that it will only get better. Bonus points - It smells wonderful (even my teen daughter thinks so).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a month and looks like it&#x27;s working! My dandruff disappeared and my scalp is no longer itching, also this is a sulfate and paraben free product and the smell is awesome! Love it 💗</li>
    <li> This shampoo is simply awesome! I had itchy scalp and this gives you instant relief and it stays like that. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I am totally willing to say the issue is me and not the product, BUT the product swore up and down it would solve he problem and it did not so…2/5. I think I might need something more moisturizing? Regardless, this is a good dandruff shampoo and my hair was clean. So if that&#x27;s you issue, this is your product. Might be a bit harsh, but I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell and so far it seems to be working for my itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This is a great product.  It has helped me get my scalp eczema to very manageable condition.  I&#x27;ve dealt with caked on crap all over my scalp for over 6 years fighting not to spend every moment scratching it off.  I still have dry scalp and occasionally a spot or 2 that flares up.  This product has definitely given me relief.  I&#x27;ll keep buying it!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff works well.  Unlike other, more commercial, dandruff shampoos, it smells great.  The oils are refreshing and it doesn&#x27;t have the icky chemical smell that other strong dandruff shampoos have.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. It lathers really nice for a sulfate-free shampoo! The essential oils in it really makes my hair feel clean afterwards. Only used it once and its already helped my dandruff. Love it!</li>
    <li> This product is the best I&#x27;ve used so far!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s truly amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;5 stars!!!</li>
    <li> At first I was unsure about ordering because it sounded feminine but I was surprised how great it smelt. I have bad dandruff and this has really been helping. Goodbye head and shoulders. And it&#x27;s sulfate free. What a deal!</li>
    <li> I always have a hard time finding things that work for my dry itchy scalp from my skin conditions. Ive tried different things and they all help a little bit but after a few uses it seems to make it worse. Its hard to find something not full of sulfates as well. Im not a big fan of the smell but if it works I can get use to it. its not over powering or anything. I use it twice a week to help soothe my scalp</li>
    <li> A few weeks ago my mom bought this for me, and I am really loving it. It smells divine and knocked out my dandruff very quickly. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is that it seemed to weigh my hair down a bit. I have very thin and fine hair, so this is really nothing new for me, though. I would certainly recommend this shampoo to friends.</li>
    <li> Although the smell is off putting, this product has worked like a charm for me.</li>
    <li> smells great. works great. no more dandruff and dry scalp.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell of this sage shampoo!  I&#x27;m a male in my low 30&#x27;s and I typically wash my hair every 3 days.  With my previous shampoos, I would notice some little white specs in my hair by day 2 and I would try to just rinse them out (I don&#x27;t like to use shampoo everyday).  I can see the effects from this shampoo and how it has helped me from noticing dandruff on the second day after washing.  I can go a full 3 days now without much (if any) dandruff showing up.</li>
    <li> Received in 2 days! After just 2 shampoos a noticeable difference and smells great! Very happy.</li>
    <li> Prior to finding this shampoo I was using two different Rx which didn&#x27;t seem to have much effect on my dandruff. After a month using this shampoo daily my dandruff has significantly diminished and my scalp is much less itchy. I would give it five stars but I had hoped it would leave a more refreshing feeling on the scalp. However still a good product.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased my second bottle of this shampoo and would highly recommend it to others looking for a solution. We have tried many things and I was skeptical at first. I read the reviews and decided to give it a try. My youngest son has special needs and I think his medication leads to excessive dryness and dandruff. At its worst, you can actually see the large flakes on the surface of his hair. After just one wash, you can see the difference! I also use it myself during the winter or after I&#x27;ve had my hair colored - I have very sensitive skin and sometimes the color leads to some scalp issues. The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming and I don&#x27;t worry about using it on my son because it is all natural. I&#x27;m thinking about trying one of their conditioners next!</li>
    <li> hello! i wouldn&#x27;t buy this because it wasn&#x27;t that great of a lather. i would definitely purchase this soap definitely if you have dermatitis because I COULD NEVER FIND ANYTHING TO GET RID OF MY SCALP ITCH! i would buy it from etsy. please check out the link if you want to purchase it.   https://www.etsy.com/listing/111918083/jasmine-shampoo-treatment-shampoo-bar?ref&#x3D;shop_home_active_1&amp;ga_search_query&#x3D;jasmine%2Bshampoo check this out it will do your scalp wonders. you can purchase it from her thru this site</li>
    <li> This by far has been one of the best shampoos that I&#x27;ve used.  I moved to a very dry mountain/desert region a few months ago and as a result, my hair has grown brittle and produced immense amounts of dandruff, which I&#x27;ve never experienced before.  I originally came across Maple Holistics when an online review guided me to the Tea Tree Shampoo for Dandruff.  While that product worked wonderfully on the dandruff, I noticed that it was not doing much to prevent hair strand loss (I lose a lot of strands per shower).  I went back to their website to see if there was a product that could address both these issues at once and came across the Sage Shampoo.  So here&#x27;s what I like about the shampoo:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It is awesome on dandruff!  Since using it, dandruff has ceased to be a problem for me.  I no longer have to worry about a dry, itchy scalp, and my hair is soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Hair strand loss:  I have literally gotten to the point where I can count the strands that I lose per shower!  On average, since using this shampoo, I lose about 15-25 stands TOPS.  This is an extreme change from feeling like I&#x27;m going bald each time I showered in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It smells wonderful!  I love the way my hair smells, and the aroma therapy benefits in terms of waking me up and getting my day started by inhaling the wonderful smell of sage and tea tree oil is a treat to which I look forward every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip: the attached card tells you to finish your shower with a blast of cold water to seal the cuticle.  I cannot stress how much of a difference this makes.  On the days that I remember to do this, my strand loss is down to the lower end of the scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ve found my new shampoo.  I will no longer buy in store again!</li>
    <li> I just had my hair treated with Keratin treatment. After treatment, I need to maintain it with sulfate free products. I came upon this product while browsing at amazon.com. I was a bit hesitant about the price but decided to order it since it has great review. I&#x27;m glad I did. This shampoo is AMAZING. Dandruff free for 2 months now. Smells great and sulfate free. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Like many others, I wanted this to work SO bad. I have controlled my bad dandruff with H&amp;S for years. For whatever reason I felt ready for a change. Bad idea. My dandruff came back with vengeance after on one week using this product. :(</li>
    <li> I have recently moved to Nevada and started struggling with extremely dry skin and dandruff. Tried different shampoos but nothing seemed to work. When I first tried Sage Shampoo (be sure to keep it at least for 3 minutes) there was no dandruff left on my shiny hair. Thank you a lot, as many people know how &amp;#34;uncomfortable&amp;#34; it is to have dandruff</li>
    <li> I tried multiple shampoos starting with head and shoulders and then venturing into naturals in order to cure my dandruff.  This was the first thing that actually worked.  It also smells great and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the long term effects on my scalp and hair of some of the chemicals used in head and shoulders.  I wish it was a little cheaper but it&#x27;s been worth the price for me.</li>
    <li> Got rid of my dandruff but I it&#x27;s not five stars because my hair falls out a bit more than usual  with this shampoo. So definitely no long term use but I&#x27;m am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This product worked!! it smells great, and left my hair so soft and shiny. It also made my scalp feel great. I will definitely buy it again!!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo! Pleasant herbal smell, works great.  Has greatly reduced my itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> I have tried countless other shampoos over the years with limited success.  This one was effective immediately and I love that it&#x27;s a natural shampoo!  Very happy with this purchase and plan to continue purchasing!</li>
    <li> No one wants to deal with dandruff. My issues have significantly decreased and didn&#x27;t make me feel gross by using some medicinal shampoo. I also received a few compliments on how good I smelled, like a more natural herbal essence.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Have always used Head and Shoulders to combat my dry scalp but to have a natural alternative is really wonderful. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It actively works on dandruff but after using this my hair become very harsh and rough.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, very gentle  and moisturizing, wonderful smell.  Came packaged well.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an anti-itch dandruff shampoo that is color-safe. It&#x27;s difficult to find a natural-ingredient based shampoo for treating dandruff that doesn&#x27;t smell like a sweaty armpit. This product is great. It smells really nice, which is an immediate bonus. It is definitely safe for color-treated hair. And I&#x27;ve seen a reduction in the itchiness of my scalp and the amount of shedding happening from dandruff. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Best I have found so far to control my itching and their customer service is incredible.</li>
    <li> Stubborn dandruff is not going to go away quickly; there is no miracle product out there that is going to work like--  yep -- magic! People have come to expect everything to work like pain medication does on a simple headache. When you abuse your scalp with chemicals for decades, you cannot expect any homeopathic product to undo that damage in a few weeks. This is why I waited to comment on this product. While all the other over-the-counter products I tried worked some (like the well-known coal-tar shampoos), they were problematic because they perpetuated the problem. This product will not! But you have to be faithful with it; follow the instructions and give it time, for it is your scalp that needs to heal, the dandruff is but a symptom of that damage. I give it 5 stars!</li>
    <li> it didnt work for me..&lt;br /&gt;no. i wouldnt recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! I have the global keratin treatment in my hair so I have to use sulfate free shampoos.  I also have a problem with dandruff.  I am so happy I finally found a sulfate free dandruff shampoo that works.  I would recommend this to anyone that needs sulfate free with dandruff issues.  This product is a miracle for my hair.</li>
    <li> So much rave about this product had me thinking this just might be what I needed. Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a bit odd to me. I can&#x27;t describe it, but it&#x27;s just not pleasant. I got used to it after a while, but the scent of all the other dandruff shampoos I&#x27;ve ever tried definitely smelled better than this (other than the T-Gel stuff I used as a kid).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also didn&#x27;t notice much difference. And the more I used it, the less effective it seemed. I think I&#x27;ll go back to my Redken Scalp Relief.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my itchy flaky scalp that is not responding to any shampoo available at chemist or hair salon.it works brilliantly. But sulphate free it strip my color off hence the four stars.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works just as described. Has a mild scent and calms the itching and flakiness even after the first wash.  Subsequent washes make it even better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had dandruff pretty much all my life.  I started using this shampoo Feb 28, 2014 and at this point I can&#x27;t remember the last time I&#x27;ve seen a flake of dandruff on my shirt or my jacket since I started using it.  Seems to work - a keeper.</li>
    <li> Sage is a great treatment option and this shampoo has a bunch of it, it has an awesome scent and lathers well for a sulfate free shampoo. A great natural solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I went with Sage!</li>
    <li> I have tried many dry scalp shampoos over the years and this one is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried so far. I get a very dry scalp during the winter months with bad itching and flaking. This shampoo helps eliminate both better than any other shampoo I have tried. It has a pleasant smell that isn&#x27;t too strong. A little bit goes a long way especially during the second application as it suggests you should hit it twice during each use. I would advise dry scalp sufferers to give this shampoo a try!</li>
    <li> Recently purchased this Shampoo after searching and searching for a natural shampoo to help with my dry itchy scalp. Finally I have found it. This product makes my hair feel good after I use it and it has a light good smell which is a plus when using a product that helps itch. (they can be stinky if you know what I mean) but this is a light sage smell and I was surprised I really like it. If your looking for a good product that is on the natural side and smells yummy this is a good choice. I gave it 4 stars because it is expensive for a pretty small bottle. However, if you want a good natural product it is usually going to cost you a pretty penny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other dandruff shampoos before and they&#x27;ve only worked for so long and I have really bad dandruff well I tried this and it&#x27;s still working on my dandruff months later! I would recommend this product to everyone I possibly can!</li>
    <li> I love this Sage shampoo for dandruff. Me and me daughter have been struggling with dandruff for a little over a year and have tried multiple shampoos which none have worked. Tried this and it works wonders for us. I has a nice smell which is a big bonus. And it doesn&#x27;t not irritate my daughters scalp who has eczema.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I have used many other products for my dry scalp and NOTHING has worked until now. Not only does it nourish my scalp it stops the itchiness too. Thanks a bunch!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Sage Shampoo for about a month now and I LOVE how it makes my hair look and feel.</li>
    <li> I got it today and used it right away.  The shampoo is so thick and rich.  I have very long hair but only needed a little shampoo because it lathered so well.  It then rinses out clean.  Not in love with the smell but since my head isn&#x27;t itching anymore and the flakes are almost gone, I can live with it.  As another reviewer suggested, I got Trader Joe&#x27;s Tea Tree Tingle Conditioner to go with it.  They work perfect together.  I will definitely buy this one again.</li>
    <li> So happy to have found something without carcinogenic coal tar to treat my 13 year old&#x27;s scaly scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the first application, combined with a new scalp scrubber/shampoo brush, I can see, honestly, about a 90% reduction of flakes in his scalp. There was no oily residue left on the hair, which feels soft and healthy to the touch. The product smells nice, herbal, not like that awful coal tar shampoo, which I&#x27;m glad to be rid of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so relieved to have found this product, because the next step was a trip to the dermatologist, and now we don&#x27;t have to go.</li>
    <li> Smells kind of like medicine. Didint work as well as I hoped. I bought this one and the Argan Oil Smampoo (also Maple Holistics), I prefer the Argan Shampo</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo but it just did not reduce the build up of oils on the scalp. I have very curly hair and oils tend to stick to my scalp instead of moving down the hair shaft as needed. Which means my hair is dry/frizzy and my scalp is oily. This shampoo did not fix my scalp issues and is not much better than ordinary shampoo.</li>
    <li> I like the smell. Does it really work for my dandruff...not too sure as I use it together with Nizoral. My dandruff is not as bad as it was, but it still doesn&#x27;t really disappear.</li>
    <li> I got it to get rid of my dry scalp, but it just diminished, it didn&#x27;t take it away. So I am back to head n shoulders shampoo.  Plus this is too expensive, 8oz is n ot much.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo! I started to get dandruff out of nowhere and this nipped it right in the bud! Plus it smells great! I will definitely be buying more of their products in the future.</li>
    <li> I just recently received this product after viewing several reviews. Only used it a few times and I already notice a drastic difference and improvement! Just this product, coupled with a scalp massager and you will be set! I have struggled with dryness for a long time and I think I have found the perfect, safe and natural product.</li>
    <li> I recently received a bottle of the sage shampoo and i&#x27;m happy to say that after only using it a few times, it has helped dramatically with my dandruff. It&#x27;s worked, for me at least, better than the store bought brands and without all the harsh dryness. I&#x27;ve been struggling with dandruff for a year now and I think I might of just found out the product to help with the issue. On top of that, safe, natural and not tested on animals.</li>
    <li> My wife and I share the same account.  So I am posting here for me.  I am an AA female, who has struggled with dry scalp, because I live in a very dry climate and over all damaged hair from coloring and chemicals.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do or what to order. After searching, I found this product to be the one.  The smell is very nice and I love that it is 100% natural.  The salon I go to, although very nice, doesn&#x27;t really use good product for AA hair.  I am very pleased and excited to try other products from this line.</li>
    <li> before i started using this product i had very bad dandruff and always had an itching scalp. i have tried everything from name brand products to home remedies and nothing ever worked!!! but now i have hardly no dandruff and no itching feeling!!! this product is definitely something i would recommend to anyone with even the slightest dandruff. and another plus is its all natural! (: as a frequent buying customer i would say its definitely worth the money also!</li>
    <li> Still get intensive itching on scalp within few hours after using this product and it makes hair thicker and more shine, smell is not strong either and lathers very good</li>
    <li> I used to use Head and Shoulders which was great for Dandruff, but not for my colored hair. I tried this. It does work, although I have to use it everyday (instead of every other day) to keep dandruff away. Overall very satisfied.</li>
    <li> For a person that suffers from dermatitis I really loved how this shampoo helped my scalp feel, no flare ups nor itchy or burning afterwards. Has a great scent and didn&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
    <li> I did not harm my hair color but it did NOTHING for my dandruff.  I not only had flakes galore, but I developed angry red patches on my scalp.  Not for serious dandruff!!</li>
    <li> Received a small sample to review I have major scalp issues and tea tree shampoos itch me this helped reduce itching and didn&#x27;t irritate now it didn&#x27;t resolve my issues in a week but I don&#x27;t feel as bad so I think this product should be considered a good option to try and I live it&#x27;s sulfate free status.  It smells very good as well  If I could find non irritating gel this product might would work better but as I need gel between shampoos it&#x27;s catch 22 for me.</li>
    <li> I have used it for about 2 weeks and so far it is working for me.  I have much less itching and scalp crusty areas than before. Will continue to use and hope it eliminates my problem.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!! This stuff really works, and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair. Will be buying again!</li>
    <li> This shampoo works pretty well but not as quick as ive been hearing it does.</li>
    <li> I came across this when I was searching for a natural shampoo to treat dandruff. I am pleased to say that it actually works! My dandruff wasn&#x27;t gone overnight (it took about 3 weeks to notice a dramatic difference) but once the dandruff was gone, the itchiness on my scalp was gone as well. The only things that would make this product better in my opinion would be to decrease the strength of the herbal smell as it was too overpowering for me and if there was somehow a way to get the same results by using one shampoo application instead of two. The instructions on the bottle say to place a quarter-size drop of shampoo and massage into hair, leave on for a few minutes, then rinse thoroughly and then repeat. The latter is only minor - there&#x27;s probably a reason the second application is necessary. Overall, I was happy with my purchase and I am glad that I&#x27;ve found a natural anti dandruff shampoo.</li>
    <li> I transitioned about a year ago to sulfate-free shampoo.  Initially, I spent time trying the drug-store brands and was not happy with the look or feel of my hair and scalp.  I color treat my medium-length, fairly thick hair about every 6-8 week which tends to dry things out (on the ends especially).  In addition, I&#x27;ve suffered from sebborrheic dermatitis for a couple of decades and have never gotten it under control to my satisfaction.  I went out searching the internet for a solution that would provide me with a nice quality sulfate-free dandruff shampoo that would be gentle on my color treated hair and came across Sage Shampoo by Maple Holistics.  I fell in love within 3 shampoos.  It took my hair about a week to get used to the new product and I must say that my hair and scalp have never been softer or more healthy (I couldn&#x27;t stop running my hands through the soft, untangled length).  It rinses clear even in my hard water and I&#x27;ve learned that less is definitely more when it comes to using the product (about a dime size massaged between the palms and rubbed on my scalp then massaged/rinsed down my collar-bone-length hair).  I completely used up the first bottle and wanted to purchase more, but was a little taken aback by the purchase price of over $17 for an 8 oz bottle.  Sooo...stupid me, I tried all kinds of recipes for making my own natural shampoo that I hoped would compare.  Spent a ton of money and nothing worked even a fraction as well.  I&#x27;m back to using this Sage Shampoo and have come to terms with the price...if money can buy the wonderful hair and scalp I&#x27;ve been gifted with, then I&#x27;ve learned to gladly pay it.</li>
    <li> It works! Plus I love the feeling it gives to my scalp.</li>
    <li> My seborrheic dermatitis hits me like clockwork every time the season changes; I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun to relieve it. In one try, this sage shampoo relieved my itching and dandruff. I also liked the fact that it had no sulfate, since my hair is color treated. It also smells great! I would recommend this product to anyone who suffers from seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
    <li> I have medium to severe dandruff condition depending on the weather. I have tried almost every shampoo that reads &#x27;gets rid of flaky dandruff&#x27;, but none of them seemed to work for me.&lt;br /&gt;I came across this Sage shampoo when I was trying to look for gentle everyday dandruff shampoo. It has been almost a year that I first started using it. And honestly, I love it. My dandruff reduced dramatically. Now, I am saying, it reduced, but has not completely gone yet.&lt;br /&gt;Repetitive usage of any shampoo creates a tolerance and effectiveness goes low. Same happened with this one too. To avoid this, I started alternating this shampoo with other Maple shampoos - like the Winter one.&lt;br /&gt;And that worked. I alternate shampoos now and my dandruff is significantly low, even in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is definitely gentle - I use it twice a week on my colored hair and pair it with Silk conditioner. The result is soft hair with, less flaky scalp. Plus, it is sulfate free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even used on my keratin treated hair and it worked just fine!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely continuing to use this amazingly fragrant product!</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo followed by the natural products. This is one of the best shampoo for itchy scalp I&#x27;ve used. My other brand is strong and make my scalp dry. But not this one. If you are looking for a dandruff shampoo, you might want to try this.</li>
    <li> Love it! Keeps my dandruff at bay and clean my hair without harsh sulfates, so I can enjoy my keratine treatment! I believe it&#x27;s the fourth bottle I purchased by now. Only wish that their was a bigger size available.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I had been reacting badly to every shampoo I used (and I have tried so many), leaving my scalp really sore. I decided to try this shampoo because of the sage, and the all natural ingredients. This shampoo has a wonderful fragrance and lathers easily. It leaves my hair soft. But best of all, I&#x27;m not having an inflammatory reaction to it. On the contrary, my head is starting to feel better and better. This is now my favorite shampoo and I&#x27;ll be ordering time and time again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works great :)</li>
    <li> I have tried many different dandruff shampoos in the past tryin to find the right one. I&#x27;ve always found that it may relieve symptoms or stop dandruff for a couple weeks, but it always came back again. My mother bought this for me for the fis time about four months ago. I have been using it ever since! I have never had anything with better results, especially such long lasting ones! Some may be skeptical because of pricing, and I was at first, which is why my mom bought the first bottle. But as the say you get what u pay for and if you want results you can pay or them! At a reasonable rate with out any embarrassing or expensive doctor visits! I love this product. You don&#x27;t need much to keep oup on the condition of ur hair and they offer conditioner as well! Def a must try if you have dandruff problems!!</li>
    <li> Great product that works! I got the Sage Shampoo for Heavy Dandruff as a gift from my hairdresser to battle my flaky stubborn dandruff. This shampoo works so well on my tight kinky coily hair without drying out my scalp. It effortlessly zaps those pesky flakes, has a refreshing scent and is filled with natural ingredients. Great results for stubborn dandruff.</li>
    <li> This is the only dandruff shampoo that I use. I like it particularly because it does not have a strong odor like some of the other ones do. I share this with my family members, and we are about to buy our 3rd bottle of this now. It is definitely a solid, pleasant product.</li>
    <li> i ordered this off the  maple holistics website. i was skeptical at first because there are so many products out there that don&#x27;t work for e but i decided to get it anyway. when i used it, even with the first wash my hair already felt better. I&#x27;m happy now because i don&#x27;t have dandruff anymore. it was something that i always struggled with but now I&#x27;m not embarrassed about my hair. i really recommend this shampoo for people that are struggling with dandruff.</li>
    <li> this product was a bit costly but it was worth every penny.i have really bad dandruff that was not helped by any shampoo until now. plus it smells great.thanks mapleholistics for an effective way to treat dandruff. i highly recommend this product to anyone with a severe case of dandruff.it made my hair soft and more manageable also.</li>
    <li> I started using this shampoo about a week ago, and it has helped with my dandruff. But I am even more pleased with the overall health of my hair! It is much more shiny, thick and healthy. Before this I was using a sulfate-based shampoo.</li>
    <li> I heared wonderful things about this product and would love to try it out and I heared this is a great product</li>
    <li> This has a pleasant smell and it takes care of dandruff problems without stripping my hair of all of its oils.  I have to use this two days in a row to solve the dandruff problem (so don&#x27;t use it one day and say it doesn&#x27;t work) and then keep it up a few times a week.  I like it much better than dandruff shampoos like Head and Shoulders.</li>
    <li> I had moderate dandruff before using this shampoo. I decided to try this when Head and Shoulders was ineffective. It was really encouraging to see a product that is all natural and sulfate-free. It has a stronger odor than I was used to but it is not unpleasant like some other anti-dandruff shampoos. After a few uses I was able to see reduced flaking. Overall, I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Head&amp;shoulders shampoo for many years. All of sudden it doesn&#x27;t work anymore. I guess my scalp has developed a tolerance. I studied websites about anti-dandruff shampoo and the conclusion is alway starting with the natural gradients. If the natural gradients don&#x27;t work, move on to the chemicals. So I bought this Sage shampoo and  followed the instruction carefully. I use it twice every morning. The smell left in my hair after shower is a bit strong. But the scalp feels cool. After three days, the dandruff is completely gone. I definitely recommend it! I did use it in combination with Trader Joe&#x27;s Tea Tree Tingle Conditioner with Peppermint and Eucalyptus though.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does what it says- it is very effective in eliminating dandruff. Unfortunately, the smell is extremely strong (it reminds me of strong incense), and it is terribly drying! My curls are dry, frizzy, and brittle after using this shampoo. I use Yes to Carrots conditioner which is very moisturizing, but even a gallon of it wouldn&#x27;t soften my hair after using this shampoo. It&#x27;s great for getting rid of dandruff, but not worth dealing with the overwhelming scent and horribly dry/frizzy hair that it leaves me with.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness, I Love this shampoo.  It  smells nice and it made my hair shine and I had so much body like I&#x27;ve never had before. I like to use natural products  and this is the first time ordering this shampoo. I am going to order more products from company .&lt;br /&gt; THANK YOU , for making Sage shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the real deal. I use this twice a week for HEAVY, heavy dandruff. Let&#x27;s just say this eliminates it. As long as I use it in combination with a dandruff scalp scrubber it&#x27;s perfect, and it smells amazing. I love this stuff x 100!!!!!</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband.  Does not work as great as expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a couple of weeks, but am pleased so far.  I&#x27;ve had dandruff/dermatitis on my scalp for pretty much my entire life.  I keep my hair very very short/shaved (I&#x27;m semi-bald), so I don&#x27;t really care about the look of my hair.  I just need something to keep my scalp from itching and flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched for home remedies, and started using a home made baking soda shampoo, with apple cider vinegar rinse.  It was too much of a pain to make, and I couldn&#x27;t get the consistency right to get a lather and keep the shampoo and rinse from just dripping right of my head in the shower.  So I decided to just try an organic product instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Found this sage shampoo on Amazon, and so far, I&#x27;ve been pretty much itch and flake-free.  My scalp also feels good after using the shampoo... feels clean, but not too tight and dry.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo because I was looking for an anti-dandruff shampoo without the feared sulfate component, which is not easy to find. I have used it for a while and really liked it. A few times at the beginning my scalp would still itch in certain areas, but lately it has worked well. Your hair might feel a bit dry after you use the shampoo, so I use a conditioner every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very satisfied with the product. I&#x27;ve been fighting dandruff for over a decade, trying different products, but all of them had the sulfate component which I believe can be harmful for your scalp. I also like the herb scent.</li>
    <li> In Texas, we have very unpredictable weather, and come winter time, the same goes for my hair. This has been somewhat inconsistent as I&#x27;ve tried to use it in different intervals - daily, every other day, and every 3 days. Daily yields the best results, but only if I also use a conditioner. Ultimately, I think I will give another shampoo from Maple Holistics a try that isn&#x27;t necessarily catered towards dandruff but something simple to treat my flaky yet oily scalp.</li>
    <li> There are lots of things i like about this shampoo. First, it doesn&#x27;t smell like anti-dandruff shampoo at all. It just smells refreshingly and calmingly good. Second, it really helps in removing my dandruff. I used to use head and shoulders but nothing happened, really. This shampoo on the other hand really showed results. Third, I noticed that my hair-fall has also lessened since I started using this. Lastly, it&#x27;s a lot less-expensive than any other anti dandruff shampoos out there. Hence, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have only used this shampoo twice so far and I love it so far. Smells good, does not dry out my hair, and I already notice an improvement!</li>
    <li> I have been battling with dandruff forever. My bouts come and go, and I&#x27;ve tried everything - from prescriptions, to over the counter, to holistic products. Prescriptions have worked best, but is pricey since insurance does not usually cover them. I came across the sage shampoo and decided to give it a try. After using this just once, there is a noticeably difference the next day. My dandruff has always been of the &amp;#34;crusty&amp;#34; kind and they all were almost gone!! I will be using this daily until the dandruff disappears and just hope that it continues working for me since I&#x27;ve tried products in the past that work in the beginning but stops being effective after some time. Because of the price, I probably won&#x27;t use this everyday. The smell is okay - I read that some think it&#x27;s too strong but it doesn&#x27;t linger afterward. Thank you Maple Holistics for gaining back my sanity!</li>
    <li> Beware this &amp;#34;sulfate free&amp;#34; shampoo lathers!! It leaves your hair dry and feeling like you used the cheap generic grocery store brand. I&#x27;m not sure why this product gets such good reviews. I don&#x27;t know if it helps with dandruff because I only used it once. As soon as I realized how much it lathers and how my hair felt after one use I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to try again. If you&#x27;re used to regular sulfate lathering shampoos then maybe you&#x27;ll like this product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has not helped my dandruff one bit. I used it exactly as directed, I even bought a second bottle recently but it seems as if my dandruff is worse than ever now. Maybe I just have a condition that this type of shampoo won&#x27;t fix, it works for other people according to the reviews. I will say that the smell is fine - it smells like holistic shampoo you would buy at Whole Foods, if that makes sense.</li>
    <li> Better than all shampoo I have tried.</li>
    <li> The ONLY shampoo that finally worked for my dandruff. I absolutely love it, just ordered two more bottles! Thank you Maple Holistics for making a product that works!!</li>
    <li> After seeing all the rave reviews, I still wasn&#x27;t convinced this would work so well... but it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Head &amp; Shoulders products for forever to relieve my persistent, inherited dandruff. They&#x27;ve worked OK, but I&#x27;ve noticed that after using them for so many years, their effectiveness on my scalp just isn&#x27;t what it used to be. After seeing initially good results, I was still getting quite a bit of dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo has reduced my dandruff to the lowest levels it has been since I started having scalp dryness. I don&#x27;t get dandruff at all anymore, except for a tiny piece of dry skin or two once a day (compared to 20+ tiny flakes on a normal day before). My dandruff wasn&#x27;t super severe, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should buy this shampoo or the tea tree oil shampoo for moderate dandruff. I looked at the ingredient list and saw that they were very similar, but the sage one was a bit stronger. I decided to go with the sage one and it has been an excellent choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo smells good (but I like hippie products/smells). It lathers fairly nicely--it doesn&#x27;t lather up as much as a store-bought shampoo or Head &amp; Shoulders, but I think that is partly why it&#x27;s so effective. As a girl with longer hair, I just use a little more than a teaspoon and can wash all of my hair effectively. If my hair is really dirty or greasy, I&#x27;ll mix in some other shampoo to get a better lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 8 oz bottle will last me around 3 months. I have medium thickness, longer hair so if you have shorter hair it will last you a good deal longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend following the product instructions exactly as written. Be sure to leave the product in your hair for at least a couple minutes to let the sage and other oils soak in, and try to rub it into your scalp as much as possible. Rinsing out my conditioner with cool water also helps reduce irritation. I will definitely continue to buy this shampoo since it works so well.</li>
    <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis...somewhat worse than dandruff as it affects both skin on your face and especially your hair. I&#x27;ve dealt with it my entire life. I&#x27;ve used EVERY shampoo over the counter and have used numerous shampoos from the Dermatologist with little to no improvement. I&#x27;m African-American and do not wash my hair every single day as is suggested by a lot of the dandruff shampoos. After using Sage, I can honestly say this is the BEST shampoo I&#x27;ve used for my scalp. I used it one week ago and have seen minimal flakes. Dandruff can make you incredibly self-conscious and it is so embarrassing...it&#x27;ll even change the colors that you choose to wear. I pray that I continue to have great results from this shampoo....if so, I&#x27;ll be using it indefinitely.</li>
    <li> I really love this shampoo after using it for about 2 months I definitely will buy it again if god allows that to happen, using this shampoo with organic vegan food to eat and now I get no falls hair and stronger and healthier thiker and shiny hair even smoother but I think organic vegan food has the upper hand I also only use cold pressed olive or coconut oil for cooking and I avoid the harmful not cold pressed oil and I definitely avoid canola oil as it toxic and I also avoid GMO food and rarely eat non organic food(they tried it on animal and the get blind and they become mad and some of the animals killed it self and don&#x27;t believe what doctors saying about the canola oil they ether don&#x27;t know or get paid for doing that, so I recommend this shampoo to any 1 alongside with organic vegan food( I eat organic meat or non organic meat and shrimp too but not to much) but make sure you don&#x27;t have any allergies with the ingredients and with the food and make sure to avoid food that makes dandruff to u, 1 more thing don&#x27;t leave it for 2 minutes rinse quickly and use it every 3 days and more and don&#x27;t use it daily and if use it too much u will get dandruff and allergie if u have a very sensitive scalp like me, good luck all.</li>
    <li> A dandruff shampoo that actually works! I have been battling with a dry scalp for as long as I can remember. I could notice a difference after the first wash - which was crazy. It&#x27;s not a cure, but my dandruff is much milder in comparison to the severe and large flakes I was recently having (gross). Also, don&#x27;t be intimidated by the small size of the bottle - a little goes a long way. I purchased it in April and use it once a week and still am not close to running out (I do have short, shoulder length hair).</li>
    <li> I bought this because my dandruff was bad I have used this for a month now and my dandruff is only getting worse</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever written an Amazon Review, because I am so blown away by the results. My husband has seborrheic dermatitis due to type 1 diabetes and this shampoo practically knocked it out after the first use. Over the counter dandruff shampoos never touched it. Amazing. We will be buying again and highly recommend. Maple Holistics customer service is wonderful too. They contacted us to see how we liked the product. I&#x27;ve been buying from Amazon for many years and that has never happened before. Very well pleased.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I love the product... haven&#x27;t seen dandruff since I&#x27;ve used it &amp; normally nothing works. I am african american and I have tight coils, so sometimes it hard to get all the dandruff out. I used Trader Joes Tea Tree tingle cond. after shampooing with this product and the 2 products 2gether are great for Natural hair! Both products are free from chemicals we should stay away from. I&#x27;m transitioning, w/out the big chop. TIP: Dry your hair before adding conditioner, so the hair can absorb more Conditioner and Less of the water after you shampoo.</li>
    <li> I got heavy dandruff, and the doctor told me buy dandruff shampoo, I chose Sage Shampoo, tried few times, it works for me, and I would like to  try other Sage products later.</li>
    <li> it has helped to control dandruff and get rid of itchy scalp.. but don&#x27;t need to use it everyday.. in the winters especially if you live in a cold dry climate, try to only wash your hair every 2nd or 3rd day and allow the natural oils in your scalp lubricate your skin.  Overwashing with most shampoos just irritates the scalp more is my experience.  Rinsing off hair and scalp with lukewarm to cold water has also helped to close the pores down.  My hair stylist also recommends blow drying your hair (at least for those with oily hair) to help keep your scalp pores from getting clogged if you allow that damp hair to sit on your scalp for too long.</li>
    <li> I have struggled FOR YEARS with incredibly bad dandruff. I mean it was nasty. I went to my dermatologist and was recommended to use prescription oils and shampoos and nothing worked. I saw this product on Amazon and I figured with the reviews that I would try it. I&#x27;m so glad that I did! Although I definitely notice when I stop using it, it has really helped with the itching and flakes. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year (?) now and my scalp is like a normal person. I don&#x27;t have a bunch of flakes anymore and my life isn&#x27;t controlled by unattractive scratching. I would say the only negative thing is that when I stop using it, my dandruff will start again. But, I&#x27;d rather use an all-natural/healthy shampoo a few times a week then used nasty prescriptions that make my hair stiff and gross. I&#x27;m really happy with this shampoo and I will continue to use it until a miracle happens and my scalp is finally normal.</li>
    <li> I have tried many, many different dandruff shampoos over the years and most do not work at all and some just work for a month and then stop, or barely hold the dandruff at bay. When I shampoo every single day and follow the instructions exactly (lather, wait a few minutes, rinse, repeat) the dandruff completely goes away, but if I don&#x27;t shampoo one day, or just shampoo once and don&#x27;t repeat, the dandruff starts to creep back. I love this shampoo because it stops any itching, smells great like aromatherapy, is all natural and made in the USA. I will definitely continue to buy this product and would like to try Maple Holistics&#x27; other products, such as their conditioner.</li>
    <li> 1st shampoo/shower got rid of dry scalp. Can now wear black shirts. No itchy scalp. GoodBye HeadnShoulders.</li>
    <li> I recently had my hair colored and keratin straightened so I was limited to what products I could use on my hair.  After a month I noticed heavy buildup on my hair to include dandruff so I needed a dandruff shampoo that was safe to use.  I immediately identified Sage Shampoo for dandruff and noticed a difference immediately.  I was also impressed at how soft the shampoo made my hair, and I LOVE the scent of the shampoo.  I recommend this product to anyone who has chemically treated hair and need a dandruff shampoo.</li>
    <li> This is working very well for me.  My scalp feels better. Not so itchy.  And it really makes my hair feel clean.  Actually, it feels squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> LOVE  LOVE LOVE! I no longer use conventional anti-dandruff products. This shampoo not only got rid of my dandruff and scalp itch, but it even sparked some new hair growth. My hair is also now softer than ever. Would love to see a travel size in this product because I travel a lot for work. THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Never in my life thinking I would have dandruff. Finally tried this product and I&#x27;m so glad it works. I love the smell of the sage shampoo as well. The best thing is Sulfate Free and its affordable</li>
    <li> This is great stuff! Not only has this worked with my scalp, but my husband, who has psoriasis on the back of his neck and scalp has seen marked improvement. I also love the silk 180 conditioner.</li>
    <li> This shampoo actually works! I was first introduced to this shampoo by a friend when we were discussing dry flakes and whatnot. After the conversation I went ahead and order it figuring it wouldn&#x27;t hurt if the didn&#x27;t work, after all I&#x27;ve tried many others before it. And after using it for the first day, I noticed it actually worked. Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s not a cure. My head still had flakes, but it did reduced it significantly. I know this because every time I rub my hands on my head, I would see little flakes snow storming in the air in a sun light room. Or I&#x27;ll see flakes fall on a table with a dark cloth if I put my head over it. It&#x27;s actually really gross and I make sure no one is around when I&#x27;m doing this. But after using this shampoo, I noticed it was maybe reduced to about half. And after using it for four day straight, I noticed it was reduced immensely. On a side note, I make sure that I use conditioner afterwards because the shampoo will leave my hair feeling like its completely bone dry.</li>
    <li> Might not be as strong as some more conventional dandruff treatments like the active ingredients in head and shoulders BUT this stuff is way more natural and gentle on your scalp. In the long run, I think that makes it an obvious winner! Great ingredients, great smell, seemingly great company as well. Pricey yes, but depends on how sensitive your skin/scalp is - if highly sensitive like mine then it is definitely worth it. Seems to be good for my thin hair and is Concentrated stuff, you don&#x27;t need a ton of it.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this products result especially considering how pricey it is versus other anti-dandruff products. I broke out the day after I used this after only the first use with really bad cystic acne all over my forehead. I have NEVER had cystic acne like this in the past. I don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> My Original Review: Feel like the shampoo does a good job cleaning the hair.  Unfortunately, I still have bad dandruff and I have been using it for awhile now.    My Updated/Edited Review: First, I got my hair wet in the shower and took a comb and scrubbed my scalp really good with the comb to get as much of the dandruff off.  Afterward I washed my hair with this stuff and see a much better improvement.</li>
    <li> I really feel it working, the ingredients are amazing. I like the smell, very natural. May be a strong smell for some, but if you think about what&#x27;s in it, you can&#x27;t expect it to smell like roses. It leaves my hair a bit dry but I always use some conditioner anyway. I will keep using it and will look for more products from maple holistics.</li>
    <li> I have severe scalp dermatitis and nothing ever worked for me, not even the solution my derma has prescribed me. I thought it&#x27;s never going to get cured anymore until a doctor friend suggested this fantastic shampoo! One month of use is all it took to treat my condition and now I have a healthier and better-looking scalp.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a dandruff shampoo with natural ingredients and this shampoo works very well.</li>
    <li> Definitively buying it again. It leaves your hair feeling clean and soft. It&#x27;s perfect</li>
    <li> I recently started working for a company that requires wearing a company shirt that is all black. For anyone who suffers from dandruff control, this is quite possibly his or her worst nightmare. All day I would constantly be checking my shoulders for dandruff flakes. It was embarrassing and annoying to say the least. I knew I had to find a solution - one that not only worked but also had a pleasant smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before trying Sage I&#x27;ve tried other dandruff shampoos before, namely Head &amp; Shoulders, but I&#x27;ve always been displeased with either the results or the horrible medicine like smell. Sometimes both! Sage for Heavy Dandruff shampoo solved both those problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a week now but I noticed a drastic difference within the first two days. As another reviewer had mentioned, I could brush my hair out in the sunlight and see tons and tons of flakes falling out. Within the first wash alone after using Sage I noticed a drastic reduction in flakes. Not only that but the smell (albeit a bit spicy) is more pleasant than any other dandruff shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Have read alot about anti-dandruff shampoos before choosing this. Was at first skeptical about the product but thought I would give it a try. Got the product yesterday and have used it once since. Scalp is completely clean and no irritation as such is experienced. The aroma of the shampoo is unique and superb.</li>
    <li> I feel that I gave this an honest chance for 3-4 weeks. I like the smell and the amount that it cleans my hair. In reference to my scalp condition, this shampoo made the dandruff worse! It went from being not noticeable to something I had to constantly check in the mirror for. Overall, I wished this had worked because I love a natural beauty product but this one wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> The oils in this shampoo (sage, spikenard, rosemary ct. Verbenone, tea tree) are all scientifically recommended for dandruff. I lookes into before spending all this money on a shampoo. It was well worth it, this is an amazing hair care product, and I am indubitably going to order again some time in the future. I would recommend this even to someone who doesnt have dandruff, because overall it is much better for the scalp than fastfood shampoos.</li>
    <li> It looks like it works great on my hair. I&#x27;m having a problem of hair fall and the shampoo is working great on it. For now, its fine and let us see how it goes ahead.</li>
    <li> I love natural shampoos and after Burts Bees changed their formula, I&#x27;ve been looking for a good product and came across Sage. Although it&#x27;s not the best at eliminating dandruff (I have yet to find one that does) it still does a decent job. But it is sulfate-free and it smells nice, which is great!</li>
    <li> In the past I have used pureology products for dandruff and that was the only kind of shampoo that could keep the dandruff away for me. I used all the store bought brands and nothing else worked.  When pureology discontinued the line I was distraught since I hadn&#x27;t been able to find anything else that worked. I found maple holistics and thought I would give it a try. Not only does it work, but it&#x27;s not filled with harmful chemicals and I love the smell!  I am going to try more of their product line for sure. I also really like the fact that all their products are 100% guaranteed.  I got an email that said if it didn&#x27;t work for me, that they would send me another product to try. Now that is customer service!</li>
    <li> I was looking on amazon for a sulfate free shampoo and decided to try this one. So far it has left my hair feeling great!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I recently had a keratin treatment done and it leaves my scalp very dry, scabby, and itchy. On top of that, I am not allowed to use sulfate shampoos as it will strip the keratin. The ingredients in this product are great and help me a lot. Very happy with my purchase plus the smell is nice.</li>
    <li> Since I started using this product I have not dandruff.  This shampoo is great and has a pleasant musky lavender scent.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find this shampoo all too effective for dandruff. It smells nice and it cleans the hair, but I can&#x27;t say for sure that it helped reduce dandruff. If you&#x27;ve tried the stuff at the store, or want a natural shampoo, give this a try, but I don&#x27;t think it works for everybody.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner gives you a soft manageable feel and it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down.</li>
    <li> It did not solve my dandruff problem.  The product cleaned my hair and smelled nice, but in the end, it was not effective for me.</li>
    <li> I am so nuts about this shampoo that sometimes I would take a bath 3 times a day just to use it..yes, every freaking time. I know shampooing too much is damaging to the hair but... It just smells and feels so great!</li>
    <li> After one and a half weeks of use, it&#x27;s working very well. When the climate changes (winter to summer like weather), I tend to get very dry scalp. It&#x27;s a little itchy but very very flaky. I&#x27;ve used about six or seven different products before. A couple of those contained the typical tea tree oil or other &amp;#34;natural ingredients.&amp;#34; So far after the second use I haven&#x27;t noticed any flakes and I don&#x27;t&#x27; have any itchiness at all. I contribute a little of this to the instructions of washing with warm water, letting it sit on the scalp, and then rinse with cold water. I believe rinsing with cold water is good for your skin also....close the pores after cleansing....The ingredients seem accurate as listed on the bottle. The smell is nice. I&#x27;m using this as my daily shampoo as of now. I started with two wash cycles for the first two days. Now I&#x27;m just doing one wash and rinse. So we&#x27;ll see how long this lasts....hopefully forever.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works great for itchy scalp. I appreciate that it is an all natural shampoo &amp; made in USA</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t fall for the fake reviews. On the maple holistics website they state if you give a positive review you get a free product. I tried this shampoo not as good as other dandruff shampoos.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend. He didn&#x27;t have dandruff, but major dry scalp, skin flakes would fall off when brushing and sit in between his hair. It was bad, he tried many different shampoo&#x27;s- Paul Mitchell Tea Tree, Head and Shoulders, Selsun Blue, Nizoral, Denorex, and Neutrogena T-Gel. None of these would help. We were willing to try anything, no matter the cost! Came on Amazon, trying to look, for something we had never seen in stores before, saw this one, read good reviews, immediately bought it. Worried what would happen, he tried it the first time and loved it. Flakes were gone after washing his hair, the next day there was still nothing. He&#x27;s been using this shampoo, only shampoo every other day and has not had 1 flake since! We owe it all to the shampoo! Love this shampoo. Yes, it&#x27;s pricey for being so small, but it does the job! About to buy the 2nd bottle now.</li>
    <li> I had very high hopes for this shampoo as I deal with severe scalp buildup and dandruff. I shampoo daily and this shampoo has kept my condition bearable, but it has not cured it. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month. It smells good and I like that it&#x27;s all natural. It would be five stars if it had cured my dandruff.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this shampoo. I struggle with dandruff. H&amp;S doesn&#x27;t work for me. Selsun keeps it under control but contains some ingredients I would rather not put on my skin.  I was skeptical about the effectiveness of a natural shampoo, but I have been using it for a week now and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It got rid of my flakes, my scalp feels clean and my hair looks great. I also have a problem with an oily scalp. I ordered Maple Holistics Degrease. I use a little Sage and a little Degrease followed by the Silk conditioner. It is perfect.  I can finally do second day hair with confidence.</li>
    <li> It arrived today and I was excited to try it. I feel like I did notice a positive difference right away.</li>
    <li> I discovered the Sage Maple Holistics shampoo for Heavy dandruff when I was researching products that were natural remedies for the terrible flaking I was having. Following the directions (applying shampoo twice) my dandruff completely healed/disappeared. I love that it is a natural solution to the aggressive seborrheic dermatitis from which I was suffering. I find if I deviate from the shampoo, my dandruff returns, so I’m sticking with this shampoo!</li>
    <li> I really like this product as its free of harsh chemicals! it leaves the hair soft and bouncy! it does work on dandruff but it takes its time. I have been using this product for a month now and I do see that it has controlled the dandruff to some extent!</li>
    <li> I did the keratin treatment to my hair. Before the keratin, I had problems with dandruff that only seemed to get worse after. I tried looking for a sulfate free shampoo everywhere that could also help with dandruff. I stumbled across this while on the search. At first, it didn&#x27;t work right away. At the second wash, I could definitely see results. Now I have little to no dandruff. Really works!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about two months.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, somewhat wavy, naturally light blond hair and during the winter months I suffer from pretty terrible dandruff. This winter up north has been especially bad cold wise and I regularly had large, like nickel to quarter sized, flakes and my scalp was so unbearably itchy that I avoided washing my hair and then having it dry at all costs because it was beyond embarrassing and uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I tried tons of shampoo and conditioners between October and December, none of them doing much more than reducing the itch a little. After finally having enough I decided to turn to consumer reviews and that led me to try this and I have to tell you, it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found so far.&lt;br /&gt;I use this shampoo and a scalp brush and I am almost completely dandruff free. It started two or three washes in and I find that while I still have a little flaking right after I shower and brush my hair, by the time I&#x27;ve dried and styled it all of the flakes are gone. More than that is it stays that way in-between washes, I shampoo every two days.&lt;br /&gt;I’ve seen a few others say this but your scalp and your dandruff is most likely different than mine, and as long as it isn’t related to an allergy or a skin condition this will most likely help you. It smells great, lathers nicely and a little goes a long way. After two months I’m about half way through an 8oz bottle. If you are even half as frustrated as I was when I found this give it a try. The company that makes it has a great guarantee and you literally have nothing to lose.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my younger sister with Down Syndrome who has had a problem with dandruff for several years (moderate to severe based on season). Although her skin in very dry it is also very sensitive.  She has been using this product for a little over a month now (every other day) and we have noticed a definite improvement!  We will definitely be purchasing again and are so happy to finally find something that works and does not leave her hair smelling like medicine.  She is very happy, which makes us very happy!</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive and equally dry scalp. I&#x27;ve been suffering from it for 6 years and nothing has seemed to work. Not even expensive strong chemical-smelling stuff my former dermatologist would give me. I got the chance though to try this shampoo out when I was staying at a friend&#x27;s house. The first thing I noticed was the smell and how it made my hair bouncy soft. I asked her where she bought it and told me she got it from Amazon. That&#x27;s when I realized that this is actually an anti-dandruff and wow. It worked for me. Within just a month of using it, my scalp seems more nourished and my visible flakes are now almost gone. I&#x27;m glad I came across it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Smells great and got rid of (for the most part) my stubborn dandruff that head and shoulders wouldn&#x27;t even take away. I would give this shampoo 5 starts but I like to wash my hair every other day or sometimes even every two days because I have very naturally dry hair. Just from not washing my hair after one day my scalp starts to get really ichy. Other than that this shampoo works amazing and I would definitely recommend it to someone having dandruff issues.</li>
    <li> Finally something that works for my Seborrheic dermatitis. Before within 2 days I will see flakes. This shampoo really works.  I just hope they will keep up the quality of the ingredients If so i maybe a forever customer.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item for my Husband and he loves it from the day one.He had Dry Scalp and Dandruff problems for last few months.This one helped in removing 95% of them and keeps his scalp clean and cool.I would strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Smells great and feels great on my head in the shower, but hasn&#x27;t really helped with my dandruff or itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend recently got on a sulfate free hair product kick, so seeing how it has benefited her hair I decided to give one a go. However, I need one that can handle my itchy scalp and dandruff issues. So after researching different products and reading countless reviews, I went with Maple Holistics, Haven&#x27;t regretted it, even after I accidentally ordered two bottles instead of one. Product gives a nice thick lather, unlike a lot of sulfate free shampoos, and it smells great (a bit like Vick&#x27;s vapo-rub, but I love that smell) and works as good or better on my scalp than other things I have used in the past, including T-Gel. I give it 4 stars only because of the price, I will reevaluate that after I finish a bottle to see how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> I have to say I love this product!  I have really searched long and hard to find this shampoo and spent a lot of money on products that claimed the same benefits with no results.  I love all the natural ingredients as well.  I have many chemical sensitivities and tend to have a probelmatic dry scalp.  Sage Shampoo has made a big difference in my dry scalp issues with out the needless chemicals.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a shampoo that would control my dandruff and still produce a good lather. It was important to me to find a shampoo that was natural and didn&#x27;t contain added chemicals. I have gone through about 12 different shampoos but none of them worked to control the dandruff or didn&#x27;t lather enough. I am so glad I finally found this shampoo! It worked right away which was great. The directions say to wash your hair twice with the shampoo per wash but after the first week I was able to skip to only wash and my dandruff is still under control.</li>
    <li> Like other people have said.... Smells odd. To me it smells like a vey salty margarita. But it works great!</li>
    <li> I bought this because of all the positive reviews. It did not work for me at all. It did not control my dandruff. It has a very strong medicinal smell, made my hair extremely dry, and my hair started falling out.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo.  My hair feels soft after washing, and no dandruff.  My scalp was damaged and became very dry after a hair perm.  This shampoo elimilates my flakes on a wash to wash basis.  It doesn&#x27;t cure dry scalp but it does help flakiness.</li>
    <li> I use Sage Shampoo in winter time, my scalp tend to be dry because of the weather and dandruff appears, so I use it once every other day and certainly the &amp;#34;white snow flakes&amp;#34; despairs. It also let my hair soft.</li>
    <li> Drys your hair out way too much.</li>
    <li> Works really well and smells like Eucalyptus! So good!</li>
    <li> Felt like I got a good wash with this product.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to lather up.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> This product worked wonder since the first use. My hair is less greasy and the scalp feel clean and refreshed. Highly recommended to those who have dandruff nightmares.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t do anything for my dandruff and made the texture of my hair dirty and dry. Smells like dog shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It smells great and I think it&#x27;s been helping with my dandruff. It really stands out because of its all natural ingredients. I also am happy with the way it lathers in my hair. Definitely will be buying another bottle when this one runs out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my son, and it is the only product that has worked for his dandruff. He loves it!</li>
    <li> This shampoo took me by surprise! I was reluctant to try it thinking all of my hair would fall out. but only the usual amount. i am a fanatic on using natural stuff.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice shampoo for all hair issues. I don;t have too much dandruff to the point of eczema, but I have a few visible flakes from time to time. Also, my hair fall has gone from bad to worse. This shampoo solved that problem for me. in no time.</li>
    <li> Eliminated my son&#x27;s dandruff (works better than Head and Shoulders shampoo)</li>
    <li> I waited a few days after using it to write this review. I have definitely seen an improvement in my hair. It is softer and not as itchy. It has a very strong scent of tea tree oil--which I like so I am okay with it. I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again :)</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shampoo:  gentle on the hair, and effective against itching and flaking.  I&#x27;ve been using it as my only shampoo for three weeks now, and shampoo with it every other day.  It is costly, but it is very thick, so you will not need as much of this as your everyday shampoo.  I take a small amount, thin it with a little water, and then apply.  The fragrance is really nice.  Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;This is a company that really stands by its products.  On my initial order, I received a bottle with a faulty cap.  Not the end of the world.  Then the company sent an amazon email to me asking my response to the product.  When I mentioned the cap, the agent both refunded my purchase price AND replaced the product for free.  Very pleased to find such excellent customer service!</li>
    <li> Smells great &amp; worked fine for me</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had dry scalp forever it seems now! Maybe 8 years. I go to professional salons and get moisture treatments to get rid of flakes but this shampoo did the job. I let me scalp get dryer than usual before using it and after one wash ( I applied and rinsed twice) I was flake free. A little pricey but worth it for sure if you suffer from dry scalp and really want some relief.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not working. Now I have more dandruff than before. Maybe it&#x27;s just not good for my type of hair.</li>
    <li> Purchased for our preteen daughter who had been suffering with MAJOR dry scalp issues.  The shampoo not only clears up her dry scalp flakes but also moisturizes her hair wonderfully!  We love it and plan to purchase again and again!!</li>
    <li> The product is very effective in many ways... my dandruff has cleared up a lot more than any other product has been able to, and my hair doesn&#x27;t fall out as much! a huge bonus as my drain always got clogged up as the grudge made a home down there... Maple Holistics has successfully exterminated my drain-grudge problem and my hair that always made it snow :) It was worth its price, as it is hard to make very effective organic products. I would highly recommend to others searching for fantastic organic shampoos!</li>
    <li> A mix of good ingredients to help me with my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a constant battle with dandruff, so I had to browse amazon and read reviews , finally i bought sage and I must say that it has a very soothing feeling in my scalp , not a drop of dandruff was seen after shampooing unlike when I use other antidandruff shampoos , I still feel the effect of the shampoo even after days .thank you so much.</li>
    <li> In the past few years I&#x27;ve started to have a really dry and flaky scalp.  I tried store bought dandruff shampoos, tea tree shampoos, and even tried adding extra tea tree oil into my shampoos.  I didn&#x27;t see results with any of them.  I finally turned to Amazon and decided to try the Sage shampoo.  My hair and scalp felt exceptionally clean after the first use.  Once I used it a few more times, I realized I did not need to use it every day because it keeps my hair very clean and oil free for a few days.  This is not normal for me at all since my hair is fine and tends to look oily after 24 hours without shampooing it.  It also manages my dandruff quite well.  It&#x27;s not totally gone yet, but much better than ever before.  Also, after my first bottle ran out, my boyfriend asked if I was going to order another bottle because he loved the way it made my hair smell.  Excellent all around!</li>
    <li> This is  a good shampoo. I am using this every day</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo for my dandruff. It has definitely helped with the itching. It lathers well and had a pleasant smell. I am hoping it continues to work well for dandruff relief.</li>
    <li> Have used for a couple weeks now, and works great.  Only need a small amount and my hair feels awesome.</li>
    <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis and am always looking for a good, natural shampoo option.  Have used this several times alone or in combo with another shampoo.  Lathers well.  Has not &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; my issues but does leave my scalp feeling clean, without buildup, and not itchy at all!  Love the smell.</li>
    <li> The smell is way better then traditional dandruff shampoo. It also has helped a great deal with my itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> I meant to write this review a week into trying this product because I wanted to test it out a bit before reviewing but ended up forgetting. So instead of a week of trying, I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month straight (minus a few days) and can honestly say this is how it works.    For those who don&#x27;t like long reviews:    Pros:    It goes a long way.  Lathers well.  Fast results.  Lessens the dandruff with continuous use.  Makes your hair a little less dull in color. (?)    Neutral:    The smell. If you like tea tree oil/sage than you&#x27;ll love this but if you don&#x27;t then you might not. But it is allot better option then the chemical smell you get with most dandruff shampoos.    Cons:    Expensive.  Makes your hair a little tough sometimes when washing out the product.  Doesn&#x27;t get rid of the dandruff.    First, I would like to point out that I had bought the 8 oz version and I still have a half of bottle left. I use a quarter amount (or a little more, especially if I wash twice) every wash so considering that, this shampoo goes a long way. Which is especially good for the price and makes it a great product, that is if only it got rid of the dandruff.    To give a little background on my history with dandruff I&#x27;ve had been dealing with it for about a year. This is the first time I&#x27;ve actually dealt with this problem for such a long period of time and being so I&#x27;ve come to realize how awful it can really be. To itching all day, to those annoying flakes that start appearing everywhere much to my embarrassment, I&#x27;ve had a horrible time dealing with it. So horrible that I was becoming desperate with getting rid of it.    That&#x27;s when I started using products that were meant to \\&quot;get rid\\&quot; of it. But alas, none of them worked. The cheap store brand shampoo I used only helped calm it down (which was what this shampoo did, except this one is much much more expensive.) and the home remedies (I said I was desperate didn&#x27;t I?) were awful to experience with and didn&#x27;t give any results at all. (Let&#x27;s just say sitting with yogurt in your hair for an hour isn&#x27;t the funniest thing you could do with your time.)    So after awhile of fail after fail, I came on amazon to look up products and their reviews. I thought that if the reviews were good enough, that the product might actually work. There were actually quite a few more products rated higher then this one but what caught my eye was that this was a more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; way of getting rid of dandruff. And knowing that allot of the other products were probably not the safest thing to put on your hair, I decided to go with this one. With all the good reviews and the fact that is was sulfate free (I&#x27;ve been wanting to go sulfate free with shampoos for awhile now), I didn&#x27;t think I had anything to lose. I wasn&#x27;t the keenest on the price ($8 is allot for a shampoo to me) but I thought that since people said it worked well and that of course shampoos that are more natural will cost more, I cringed my way to the checkout, ordered it, died a little on the inside, and then waited patiently for it to arrive.    The product came 8 days later and I used it right away. The shampoo had a somewhat thick consistency and the smell is exactly like what you would expect, tea tree oil and sage. And though allot of people said it smelled strong, I have to disagree. Sure it makes your bathroom smell like a herbal store (which could be a plus or a minus) but when used it your hair it leaves only a slight smell behind. When using, it lathers well which I liked because unless it suds, I don&#x27;t think it works. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair soft but rather ruff/hard and so you might have to fight your way through with your fingers at the end of the wash. But weirdly this can be a thing that only happens in some washes, other times it leaves your hair the same way when using other shampoos.    Here are the directions of the shampoo that I followed when using:    Rinse hair, massage quarter sized-amount throughout scalp, allow the therapeutic benefits a few minutes (2-3) to osmose before rinsing. Repeat and follow with a final rinse.    Tips: Use warm water throughout the duration of the shower. Finish off with a blast of cold water to seal the cuticle.    Looking back I realize that I didn&#x27;t wash twice every time either. But I don&#x27;t think that would effect the results or change them. I will do so with the rest of the product just in case.    The very first morning I felt a HUGE difference. The dandruff wasn&#x27;t gone all the way and the itching was slightly there but it was so much less than before. The flakes were also all but almost gone. I was about sold with this product. Gone almost in just one wash? YES. This made me think that in a few more washes, the dandruff would be completely gone!    A few washes later...    Nope.  The results were the same, which is good and all since it makes the dandruff less horrible but I bought the shampoo to get rid of the dandruff, not to lessen it. Then one night I decide not to take a shower and when I woke up the dandruff was right back to it&#x27;s horrible state. So I made sure to take a shower each day but I got the same results. It lessened it when I used it and when I stopped it just came back. So while this shampoo was a great concept in the beginning, in the end it didn&#x27;t do anything different than what every other shampoo I&#x27;ve tried in this category does. Which is a bit disappointing, especially for the price. Though it does says money back guaranteed but even then I don&#x27;t know if that means if the products doesn&#x27;t work at all.    UPDATE: After reaching out with an email to Maple Holistics about the product and results, they emailed me back within minutes with an offer to try another product absolutely free and gave me back my full refund. Can I just say wow? I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever dealt with a company this awesome and hassle free. If I could give you 5 stars for customer service, I would!    So in the end, I would suggest not buying this product unless you&#x27;re looking for an instant and temporally relief for just a bit. If I end up finding another product that works well with getting rid of dandruff, I will post it in this review.</li>
    <li> I have been on topical steroids for a scalp condition for about 6 months now. Nothing has been working. I&#x27;ve tried over the counter anti-seborrheic and anti-dandruff shampoos, and still, nothing has worked. This shampoo in about two weeks has made such a huge difference. My scalp no longer appears to be coming off into my hair, and the front part of my scalp is no longer driving me insane with itchiness. The back part of my scalp has improved, and I imagine in another few weeks will also be drastically better much like the front part. I hope Maple Holistics never stops making this product, it&#x27;s a life saver.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. It has a nice tingling sensation and smells great. It does a good job of getting rid of the dandruff, but it&#x27;s not 100%. It certainly works better than most of the products I have used without the nasty chemical smell. I would recommend anyone giving it a try to see if it works for them.</li>
    <li> I waited a few weeks before reviewing this product to give it a fair amount of time to yield results.&lt;br /&gt;After about 2 weeks of use, I can affirm that the product really does work. I use it in between regular shampoo/conditionser, so approx. 3 times per week. When the weather changes, my scalp gets very dry - and there is a very noticeable difference since I started using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I was attracted to thi sone over another leading option due to its organic nature &amp; non-chemical list of ingredients. I also saw that the company offerd 100% satisfaction guarantee, so I figured it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must warn you of the very strong smell- the sage is very intense and I almost stopped using it after the 1st time because I was completely offended by it. I actually had a business meeting that 1st morning and was nervous that the shampoo smell would linger and be very awkward in the meeting.  Maybe I&#x27;m used to it by now, but it is definitely a strong and unpleasant smell (reminds me of walking into an incense store). I really wish that it smelled better, but will put up with it for the results.</li>
    <li> Feel great first try!</li>
    <li> This works ... love how it makes my scalp clean and free of dryness. I cannot use, regular shampoo due to sensitivity. Unfortunately, when I travel, I sometimes use what I have to. Dry scalp from sensitivities, happens. I get home use this and voila, happy scalp.</li>
    <li> I have persistent dandruff since many years. Tried almost everything but nothing has helped. This is the first time i have ordered this product and I can see lot of difference in my scalp. Its not scaling or itchy if I use the shampoo regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this shampoo hasn&#x27;t helped a lot to my wife with her dandruff issue,</li>
    <li> A buddy gave me a small sample to try before I purchased a bottle.  I can&#x27;t provide any long term feedback, but after using enough for a few days, I ordered some.  It feels great, seems to prevent the dry scalp issues and as an added bonus, it has a really nice sent.  A far better product than the cheap grocery store variety...Give it a whirl!</li>
    <li> Daughter has very oily hair, flaky scalp. Her dandruff is not improved and she washes and rinses twice. The cost is pretty large for the lack of benefit achieved.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this shampoo. I liked how it smelled, however I was slightly disappointed as my dandruff didn&#x27;t lessen as much as I would have wanted it to. My scalp did feel a tad bit better, but not enough to convince me to purchase this shampoo again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is AMAZING ......I have disgusting dandruff and this got rid of it......I am in love with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I was at my wits end... My scalp was totally flaky and it itched!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this stuff after trying a bunch of other stuff and it worked good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the thing-  you&#x27;ve got to use it all the time for it to work.  Once you stop here comes that itchy scalp!</li>
    <li> I have used 2 bottles of the Sage Shampoo and while it has helped with my itchy scalp, it hasn&#x27;t cured the dandruff.  If I switch to a different product the itch returns so I guess it works, just not as well as I had hoped.  I like the smell of the shampoo which was a contributing factor in my purchasing the 2nd bottle. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the shipping and it arrived in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
    <li> very smelly and didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> I have never had a product that would make my flakes worse than normal, until this shampoo. It smells good but over the course of one week my scalp kept getting worse and worse. I wish I could be refunded because it was a lot of money for a small container.</li>
    <li> This review is for this shampoo and the Silk-18 conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have thick hair and sebaceous dermatitis.  My scalp gets an extra layer of skin and dandruff.  I&#x27;m older, and my hair is so dry I wash my hair only once a week, even with my scalp condition.  I&#x27;ve used Head &amp; Shoulders and it helps but is drying.  I tried tea tree shampoo and that makes my scalp tingle and feel clean but its scent is too strong.  So I tried this shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The shampoo doesn&#x27;t tingle, still my scalp and hair is very clean.  Its scent is barely there, not too strong.  It lathers up so well I don&#x27;t use as much as with other shampoos, very efficient.  I was concerned though, because after rinsing out the shampoo, my hair felt too dry.  Then I used the conditioner and wow it felt thick and smooth, even the ends.  Instead of feeling brittle, I&#x27;m enjoying how my hair feels soft, bouncy and healthy, even my old hair :)  The shampoo and conditioner work well together.  After a week, my scalp is still clean and my hair is soft and not fly-away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Because the shampoo seems to strip the hair clean, I recommend using the conditioner also.  They&#x27;re definitely a team.  I&#x27;m loving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/3/16&lt;br /&gt;I still love this shampoo, in fact I take it with me to my salon appointments!  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I have had pretty bad dandruff since moving to the mid west. Black is but is not my color on a dry day. I have used everything on the store sells to help fight this embarrassing problem. Long story short nothing worked, but this product is. Nice and delightful smell, I can see it daily improving my scalp heath. I will be buying from this company again. Amazon please add this to subscribe and save :3</li>
    <li> As far as how well this shampoo works for my scalp alone I would definitely give it 5 stars - well worth the price for it&#x27;s ability to keep my shoulders flake-free (a problem that just recently arose after giving birth to my 3rd baby).  However, I did take one star off for the smell.  It&#x27;s not a bad smell - just not a good shampoo smell.  The sage is very strong and every time I use it I can&#x27;t help but think I&#x27;m going to smell like a roast turkey dinner!  That being said, I&#x27;ve yet to have anyone comment on the smell so perhaps it wears off quickly after exiting the shower.</li>
    <li> I’m always searching and trying natural products (make-up, hair, vitamins, etc). I came across Maple Holistics products weeks ago and decided to try their Sage shampoo and Silk 18 conditioner.  Both products are excellent, my hair feels healthier than ever, it is shiny, clean, and smells wonderful.  The Sage shampoo does not cause build-up yet, it is very gentle. I have extremely fine hair and so I have to be careful what products I use.  I’m planning to stick with these two products. I’m a huge fan!&lt;br /&gt;I’m also very satisfied with the retailer Maple Holistics, they were extremely professional and speedy!  Ordering today again a new supply from them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s doing nothing for my sudden scalp flaking this summer, but I think the dandruff was caused by moving into a house where the water seems more chlorinated. My clothes are getting faded after washing them, too. My hands get super dry after washing them at this house. Still, this shampoo seems really drying. My fingertips feel totally depleted of natural oils after washing my hair.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance (finally something that doesn&#x27;t give me a nagging migraine), not sure I have achieved the desired results yet but I just started using it. I wish there was a conditioner in the same line.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me whatsoever. I used this stuff everyday, as directed and my dandruff is still the same. For $17.95 for 8 oz, it&#x27;s pricey too. Off to try TGel now I guess.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband. It already been around four months. Both of us like its smell. It works fine. We switch between H&amp;S every week, so it&#x27;s hard to tell which does the better job. But this one is all-natural, we do prefer it. We will stop using H&amp;S this week and give this a fair test.  Update: after we stopped using H&amp;S and only use this shampoo with 2nd bottle, it doesn&#x27;t work any more. I convinced my husband to keep using this for a month and see if the situation changed, but no miracle. We have to buy H&amp;S again. Sorry to learn about it. I hope it works for you.</li>
    <li> NICE CLEAN FEELING BUT NO EFFECT ON DANDRUFF. NICE INGREDIENTS BUT NO IDEA WHO MAKES THIS STUFF AS LABEL IS A BIT MYSTERIOUS</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with a terrible scalp condition for many years now.  This is the only shampoo that offers me relief!  I use it every day and I have seen dramatic improvement.  I feel confident and my head feels great.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so nice to have finally found a dandruff shampoo that is all natural, and really works. A little goes a long way, and the smell is rather mild, compared to most shampoos. From the ingredient list, it looks like it&#x27;s gluten free, which is a plus.</li>
    <li> This is a good remedy against dandruff. It contains only natural ingredients therefore it didn’t affect my scalp skin and it proved to be very efficient. I also noticed that it lasts long. It’s a great deal.</li>
    <li> Amazing product....First of all, works great, the promised effect is there--- scalp feels free of itching, burning, clean clothing, no dandruff.. In addition, lathers very well, plenty of bubbles and foam:). I love the herbal smell, -very pleasant and relaxing. Price is very reasonable. In addition, sulfates free- so, for people with keratin treatments on their hair (like me) - perfect find...I took me a while to find this product but I am very satisfied with the quality and feel of the product.</li>
    <li> I am very devout to using only natural body products, so I have tried for over 4 years to battle this highly embarrassing problem of having dandruff, with all those methods you find on the internet like using baking soda, lemon, apple cider vinegar, various oils, yoghurt and tons more including other natural anti-dandruff shampoos but nothing has ever really worked. Sometimes results lasted a day or so but the dandruff would always come back. But about 3/4 of the way through this bottle (8oz), washing my hair twice a week, I can honestly say my hair is completely dandruff free, and has been so for about a month. My scalp is so clear and clean, it&#x27;s amazing! I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! After trying it at my sisters place (she owns every type of &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoo and conditioner out there) I fell in love with this product. It&#x27;s so hard to find something that&#x27;s worth spending the money on, especially because it helps for my hair loss as well as the mild dandruff that I have. Great product! Excited to try more from this brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product twice and have already observed a noticeable reduction in flakes throughout the day.  It doesn&#x27;t contain any artificial fragrances, but the herbal scent is quite strong -- I like it.  My hair has a decent texture without using conditioner, but I wish that it had left behind more of the natural oils.  The texture of the product itself is fairly creamy and opaque; it lathers more than I expected and it does an excellent job of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it continues working as well as it has been, I will upgrade this review to 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have dry itchy scalp and it gets worst when the season changes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works for the most part until the season change. Then nothing can stop the dry/itchy annoyance. But even at it&#x27;s worst the product managed to reduce the amount of dandruff. So I recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this shampoo for my husband and me, both of us suffered from dandruff and we were looking for natural shampoo without bad chemicals. We tried several anti-dandruff shampoo before Sage Shampoo and they didn&#x27;t work for us. But this shampoo is totally great for us, dandruff disappeared and hair looks amazing. Usually I wash my head every other day, but with this shampoo even on 3rd day my hair looks good. Definitely we&#x27;ll buy it!</li>
    <li> Tried Maple Holistics &amp;#34;Tea tree&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Degrease&amp;#34; and this &amp;#34;Sage&amp;#34; shampoo.  This one has the strongest herbal scent (but a pleasant one) as well as the strongest cleaning power.  It makes my hair feel squeaky clean, but not dry.  Those who don&#x27;t mind the strong herbal scent, this will be a very effective shampoo to try.</li>
    <li> The Maple Holisitics Sage Shampoo was able to help alleviate a dandruff issue for one of my kids that several other products wouldn&#x27;t. The minute you see the bottle, you can tell it&#x27;s a quality product. The healing formula using natural ingredients simply does what the over produced and over industrialized shampoo industry can&#x27;t. If more people today would try to use natural products, we&#x27;d probably have a much healthier society as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;Maple Holistics gives you that edge.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for putting a product on the market that allows for people such as myself to take advantage of a much healthier alternative lifestyle.</li>
    <li> This is a really good shampoo for those with dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis. Within a week of using it my dandruff was almost gone. This shampoo really dries out your hair, so I would advise you to use a conditioner or some other moisturizing product afterwards. I actually started getting more flakes until I realized that my scalp was very dry and started moisturizing, since then I&#x27;ve had no problems with this product.</li>
    <li> Alternating with Moroccan Argan oil shampoo, Sage Shampoo for Heavy Dandruff with Jojoba is the best recipe to combat the pest of the chemical-made shampoos! It is so gentle yet with the strength to keep the scalp healthy. It takes a while to get rid of a chemical-free shampoo residue, so be patient and don&#x27;t expect to be cured overnight. My son started to develop a nasty flaky-itchy-dandruff type condition when I started looking for an alternative to cheap-made products and I found through Amazon these two shampoos that have proven to be good to eliminate the scalp fungus. He&#x27;s a young adult and obviously he eats junk, which cooperates with any chemical product he uses, like shampoo. The best way is to start is with a organic black soap -I bought through Amazon- then go to a chemical-free shampoo, but sage products are amazingly good!</li>
    <li> Smells great, and I have been searching a long time for an alternative to the chemical smelling standard anti-dandruff shampoos. I like the way it rinses out leaving no residue too, which makes my hair feel very clean, but I haven&#x27;t seen a dramatic reduction in my dandruff yet - maybe I need to use it a few more times: I&#x27;m just starting with this product. For what it&#x27;s worth, I like the packaging, but I find the price very high. Coming back to this - after using the shampoo just a couple more times I can say it really does work. Bravo. Just wish the bottle was bigger.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really care for the smell. It works a little better than Head &amp; shoulders but nothing great... I think you have to use it for a longer period of time to see results. :/</li>
    <li> It removes the oil and dirt well, dandruff was reduced after first few washes but have been seeing it back in recent days, it&#x27;s not a permanent solution for dandruff. I feel it works better when the scalp is left with shampoo for at least 4 mins. Scalp feels very clean and it does make the hair bit dry but it&#x27;s ok for me as I use conditioner.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I have a really dry scalp and I noticed a difference within just a few washes that the dryness decreased.  The only thing that does not make me &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; this product is that I think it interferes with my natural pH.  I noticed I have to wash my hair a little more frequently than if I were to use a regular shampoo.  Otherwise, this product is really good</li>
    <li> If used as directed, this shampoo will help tremendously in reducing build up and dandruff. Any scaly build up on your scale? This will take care of it. I have very dry, curly hair so I normally don&#x27;t wash my hair often - no, it doesn&#x27;t get gross or greasy. I&#x27;ve just been fortunate. I only washed my hair 2x a week sometimes even 1x a week. Unfortunately, that isn&#x27;t enough for this shampoo to work so I increased to 3x a week and it has greatly reduced the amount of dandruff and flaking. It is very drying, however, so I recommend a deep conditioning treatment afterwards. I have colored hair and use this as my primary shampoo. I haven&#x27;t noticed any fading but I&#x27;m not sure if its color-safe because my natural color is very close to what I have applied over. The most important thing with this shampoo is to deeply massage it into the scalp and let it sit for a few minutes.</li>
    <li> My 15 year old son has severe dandruff... he has for years.  It&#x27;s built up on his scalp and looks like scales.  We&#x27;ve tried so many products--I was about to give up.  The tea tree shampoo by Paul Mitchell was worthless.  He used the Sage shampoo today and holy cow what a difference.  I bought it based on the previous reviews on Amazon.  Yes, it was pricey, but I feel worth it.  I told him to wash his hair twice and follow the directions on the bottle.  It was amazing how much of the scaly stuff came off (kind of gross too, but that&#x27;s what needed to happen).  I&#x27;m a fan and will totally buy again.  My son said the shampoo had a pleasant smell and he could tell it was working because his scalp tingled.  I wish I had found this shampoo for him years ago.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural and safe solution for my 6 year-old daughter&#x27;s flaky, red scalp and this product came up in my search on Amazon.  My daughter has hair down to her waist so I also wanted to find something that would last. From the first wash I was more than impressed.  I followed the directions on the bottle with the double shampoo and found that the quarter amount recommended was plenty to wash her hair.  I followed the wash with the Silk 18 conditioner, which smells wonderful, and her hair is soft, silky and flake free.  My scalp tends to get a bit dry and itchy in the winter, so I have been using this product 1-2 times a week and just love it!  My hair, which is color treated as well, feels so soft and healthy for the first time in years and I don&#x27;t have to add other products to it.  I am in love with the products from this company and will be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read both the positive reviews as well as negative reviews about the Sage shampoo before I ordered it.  I was skeptical whether it would work on my dandruff problem.  Before using this one, I&#x27;d used many dandruff shampoo at the local Walgreens/CVS, none of which worked well.  Sure I&#x27;ve seen slight improvements on my dandruff, but I can&#x27;t claim that those products &amp;#34;worked&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;ve also tried some other solutions like using no shampoo, various other regular shampoo from the local Walgreens/CVS, and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s natural soap.  None of these also worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After finding this on Amazon, I decided to give it a try, keeping a skeptical mind.  After using it ONE time, I&#x27;ve noticed a 90% reduction in flakes.  I have a very sunny living room, and before using the Sage Dandruff shampoo, when I brushed my hair with my hand in the living room, I can see the flakes flying around.  After using the Sage shampoo, I purposefully brushed my hair with my hand in the sunlight to see how much dandruff would fly around, and to my amazement I saw about 90% less than the previous day.  Furthermore, my scalp doesn&#x27;t feel itchy at all, in contrast to other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having used the Sage shampoo, I can only say that it worked great for me.  I think everybody&#x27;s scalp is different and are living in different environment, so results may vary, but for me, it works great and I got great results.  Will keep buying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a shampoo that helped my dry itchy scalp without leaving my hair dry and limp which is a big issue for me since I have fine hair. I saw results instantly but used the shampoo for a few weeks just to make sure that the results were consistent before I wrote a review. However, I finally found a shampoo that relieved my dry flaky scalp and I gave me full healthy hair, something I never had. Being from the Midwest where winters are harsh, it&#x27;s really hard on your skin so its really important to have a good shampoo. I&#x27;m so happy I finally found one!</li>
    <li> i love this product a friend of mine introduced me to it and it is amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son. I have been battling scalp problems with him since he was a baby, everything from cradle cap then, to very heavy dandruff now. I have taken him to dermatologist and tried very expensive prescription creams and shampoos. They minimized the problem, but never fully cleared it up. I came across the Sage Shampoo on Amazon, and decided to give it a try since it is made with natural ingredients. It arrived pretty fast. My son has been using it for about 3 months and so far his dandruff is almost gone. Another plus is I don&#x27;t have to worry about what is in the shampoo, which I did with the prescription stuff I was getting from the doctor. I can only imagine his condition will continue to improve. I plan on purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This product is simply amazing! I use both the shampoo and conditioner and loved the results! It&#x27;s a little bit pricey but worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, moisturizes my hair and keeps dandruff away, even in the cold of winter.  I bought a bottle months ago and figured I&#x27;d try a different brand afterward.  Ended up coming back to this shampoo.  Even though it&#x27;s a little pricier, a little goes a long way.  And I love the scent and gentle tingling feeling on the scalp.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo it really helps with dandruff. My family tried everything we could find and we came across this and BOOM answer to our problems</li>
    <li> My boyfriend started using this shampoo first and convinced me to try it. I was reluctant to start using it because of the price, but it is way more effective than any dandruff shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I use this shampoo every time I wash my hair and make sure to rub it into my entire scalp. As a result, my hair has been flake-free for the past four months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of the shampoo is fairly thick and like most dandruff shampoos, it doesn&#x27;t lather as much as regular shampoos. I don&#x27;t really notice the smell, so I guess it smells fine (not great, not bad). The instructions say to use a quarter sized amount, but I usually need more to cover my entire scalp.</li>
    <li> I loved how my hair smelled natural and my dandruff is manged well using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I use the sage shampoo and conditioner because i have very bad dandruff im always scratching at my head because of it. after trying many other dandruff shampoos and conditioner i found this to be the best. it leaved my hair soft and smells so good. my head doesnt itch and im not embarrassed anymore to wear dark color clothes. it took about a week or so of using it constantly to get rid of the dandruff but so worth it. i also love how you DO NOT test these on animals. Thanks for caring</li>
    <li> Took a chance and tried this after using every dandruff shampoo I could find in the stores... I have gone through several strengths of t-gel, selsun blue, nizoral, and more... After reading reviews I bought this and alternated with nizoral every other use. I started to realize my scalp was less itchy when I used this. Low and behold I think i was over treating my dandruff and dried my scalp out. I now use just this shampoo and a dandruff shampoo only once a month or so as needed. It was worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I had high expectations for this product, but it didn&#x27;t so anything for my dandruff.</li>
    <li> Smells good and cleans well, but did not solve the dandruff problem. I have a prescription shampoo from my dr. but I&#x27;m trying to keep away from the chemicals and such as much as reasonably possible. I was excited when I found this and thought it would be a great alternative to chemical laden shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It reduced the dandruff for me a little but not enough. Maybe 40-50%?</li>
    <li> i bought this product a few days ago and so far it works great, i have problem with a dandruff and this product really ease my dandruff, i love the smell of the product.</li>
    <li> The product works great and does not dry out my hair.  I love that it is also cruelty-free.  Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> You can tell this product is natural the second you begin applying because of the aroma. I love the tingly feeling the tee tree oil has after you even get out of the shower. I noticed a difference with my dandruff as well!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I ever bought. I have used it only couple of times and I can already see the change. My hair is healthier and dandruff is gone!!</li>
    <li> I was a little worried about spending this much money on yet another product that may or may not work - but I love this shampoo!  After three days my scalp has almost entirely cleared up and I am not itchy at all!  I am very happy I discovered this product and will be buying it exclusively!</li>
    <li> Smells great and works well after only 3 days of use.  My scalp is less irritated than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo with few flaws. I had really bad dandruff, nothing worked... nothing. This shampoo worked for me after 2 weeks of use. I seen the results after 3 uses, however, after 2 weeks i had almost little to no dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, the reason i scored this 3/5 is because of its flaws. Your hair will smell odd to say the least, and its extremely drys out your hair to the point i was loosing more than average amount of hair. It also removed natural shine and color from your hair, making it look dull.</li>
    <li> This great product. I love it, I got a free sample from the company to try out the product which I love that they offer a free sample. I have had bad Dandruff for as long as i can remember and nothing that i have tried before ever worked like this one has. I have used a couple of times now and see a big decrease in the flakes its not gone yet but here&#x27;s to hoping. If you have had bad dandruff and nothing has worked for you in the past try this it makes a difference.</li>
    <li> I have always have dranduff problems and used to use the commercial shampoo (H&amp;S). It worked for a while but stopped working,I guess the hair get used of it.&lt;br /&gt;After finally years of look some shampoo in the market that treat dranduff I found this one. Actually loved the fact is Cruelty and sulfate free. I gave it a chance and I am having good results so far and after the shower,my hair doesn&#x27;t look frizzy and dry.&lt;br /&gt;*******************************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I am by my second bottle of this shampoo (The first one last me few months!),unfortunally while I was out of the country,I had no more product and I had to go back to the regular commercial anti- dandruff shampoo and only with 2 weeks of using it -every other day-,my dandruff came back. Definitely I am sticking with this brand and I using it as they say in the instructions because my scalp gets so much better from the first use.&lt;br /&gt;3 important things you need to do in order this to work its best:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Use warm water during the shower,but finish off with COLD to seal the cuticle.&lt;br /&gt;-Massage the scalp for one minute after shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;-Let the shampoo for at least 2-3 minutes.</li>
    <li> After having a baby, it seems like the health of my scalp has changed. I now ave itchy scalp and dandruff! very prominent. Embarrassing. I am 30 and never had this problem before having children. Head and shoulders didn&#x27;t work for me. I tried everything. A friend told me of this product. It seems to of done away with my dandruff! I love the smell. I love the natural aspect of it. Nothing stripping my hair or damaging it. At least I hope. I recommend this and conditioner to go with!</li>
    <li> I have been using sage for dandruff for about 9 months and I had just cut my hair into a bob when I started using it. It really helps the itching and a plus is that it doesn&#x27;t have a terrible odor that sticks to your hair. I use it 3 times a week, just like I used to with regular shampoo so my hair doesn&#x27;t be dry. And also since using my hair has grown almost 7 inches in 9 months!!! Im very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I really like the sage smell of this shampoo and the fact that it is natural and really cleans my hair. It hasnt really done much for the flaky scalp which is unfortunate as it wasnt cheap and that was supposedly the benefit of this shampoo.</li>
    <li> great shampoo but expensive</li>
    <li> I am blown away by this product!  I&#x27;ve tried many for my dandrift but this even surprised me.  After the first use my dandrift was gone! It took me many products but when I read other reviews about the product,  I just had to try it.  I recommend this product and have already got a few more people to buy some.</li>
    <li> worth the money.  excellent</li>
    <li> Great smell! Seems to work as well as other dandruff shampoos but I like that it doesn&#x27;t have all the extra chemicals in it. It&#x27;s I little pricey for what you get.</li>
    <li> I have used this product 4 times and I already LOVE it.  My scalp does not feel itchy, and my hair looks great.  This was an amazing find.  I love this product so much that I will look for other products from Maple Holistics.  The only downside of course is the price, which is a little steep, but the quality of the product is great and worth it.  The shampoos that I buy at the local groceries tend to leave my hair and scalp very dry, and I believe the harsh chemicals used in them may be a factor.  I have tried another &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; shampoo before from a different company, but it seemed to have the same effects as the big brand companies.  This Sage Shampoo is great and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well on me</li>
    <li> This product got rid of all my dandruff and residue and almost all of the itch. It is much better than many of the products I&#x27;ve tried, including Desert Essence. I would give it 5 stars if it got rid of all the itch, but the itch is over 90% improved with it. I noticed a difference after the first wash and it improved over the next week or two. I followed the directions exactly. I would purchase this again. Thank you for making a natural shampoo for this frustrating and embarrassing issue.</li>
    <li> This shampoo really works!  I have tried numerous dandruff shampoos over the years and have always been disappointed.  After just 2 washes with this product, my scalp was clear.  The company was kind enough to send a sample of the shampoo so I could try it before purchasing.  Needless to say, I just placed an order for my first full size bottle.  I look forward to making this product a staple in my hair care regimen.</li>
    <li> The shampoo definitely smells like dinner, which is it&#x27;s biggest turn off. There is definitely sage in the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is doing alright. I&#x27;ve been using it every other shampoo for a little over a month instead of a product that contains zinc pyrithione. I was looking for a sulfate free dandruff product so that my hair coloring wouldn&#x27;t fade so much. It doesn&#x27;t work as well as a dandruff shampoo and i&#x27;m noticing some patches in the usual places. But by now I&#x27;d normally be out of control. Also, my color looks pretty good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you don&#x27;t have significant dandruff without the use of a zinc pyrithione shampoo, then you&#x27;ll be able to get away with this one and be happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably keep using it at every shampoo with a once a week zinc wash and see if that&#x27;s better.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from dandruff for most of my life and treatment has been a struggle since I made the switch to all natural body products.  This shampoo has worked wonders on my dandruff and I can honestly say I have no noticeable dandruff now.  The only time I ever get dandruff anymore is when I scratch my head...but I assume this is normal for anyone! My girlfriend, who doesn&#x27;t have dandruff but also uses primarily natural products, loves how this shampoo lathers compared to other natural options.  The only thing we dislike about the shampoo is the smell...it smells a little too strong and a bit on the feminine side.</li>
    <li> It removed the oiliness from my scalp, but did nothing for the actual dandruff.  It&#x27;s getting two stars because it smells pretty nice and I like that it is organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason brand Dandruff Shampoo seemed to work better, but I haven&#x27;t tried it long-term.  It seems like dandruff products work for awhile, then your scalp &amp;#34;catches on&amp;#34; and refuses to be controlled anymore.  Sigh.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff for my son! It smells great and his dandruff is completely gone.</li>
    <li> A little while back I was having a very hard time controlling the white flakes, and itchiness from my scalp. I had a friend that uses it so she came me a bottle of it. I used it for about 2 weeks and there was such a big difference in my hair and scalp. I was not itching anymore, there were no flakes. My hair and scalp looked great, moisturized and shinny. it worked so well that my oldest daughter uses it when her scalp is dry and flaky.</li>
    <li> this stuff is absolutely wonderful! took my severe dandruff right away!!</li>
    <li> Love the way this makes my hair feel. I have been dealing with dandruff for along time. Unlike other products this leave my hair smelling great and manageable. This is a product you can use every day and even use on children!!!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! I got this from my mom as a gift and it has done wonders for my scalp. I have tried everything and nothing has worked, until know!! I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> So far the only shampoo that has worked for my flaky scalp. I think my search for a good shampoo has finally ended.</li>
    <li> The Shampoo works very well! I usually just use about a coin-size mixing with other shampoo that I have, so there would be enough foam.</li>
    <li> Fantastic smell, works very well on itchy, flaky scalp, and does a great job on hair, too.  Will definitely buy more. Seemed a bit expensive at first (the bottle is only 8oz.), but have been using daily per directions since Christmas and there&#x27;s still more than 2/3 of a bottle left!</li>
    <li> Simply put, i didn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;ve tried for well over 10 weeks, and I still have terrible dandruff. I do like the earthy smell, but it doesn&#x27;t for me. I&#x27;ll update this if anything changes. Which i&#x27;m pretty sure at this point it won&#x27;t &#x3D;/</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Lathers very well, so a little goes along way, making it more economical than one might think. You can feel it working, but not in a strong chemical way that strips your hair. Has a distinct herbal smell, but not medicinal; very pleasant. And afterward your hair looks and feels very soft and healthy, even without conditioner. And made in the USA with quality, natural ingredients. Excellent product indeed.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter because she gets crazy dandruff and I wanted to use something more natural.  It takes a few washings to see a difference, but after a month it seems to be working.  This shampoo lathers nice and has a nice tea-tree smell, she says it smells like \\&quot;pepper\\&quot;...lol</li>
    <li> I got this for my son who has heavy dandruff. I notice right away after he used it that his flakes were much smaller and fewer. He has been using it for about a month and his dandruff is almost completely gone. It does what it says as long as you follow directions and keep using it consistently it will significantly get rid of your dander. Lastly on an odd note my cats can&#x27;t get enough of my son&#x27;s hair since he has been using it. After every shower when he uses it they start rubbing against his head.</li>
    <li> I have used this for heavy dandruff but thats ok for me....i will not say that it effectively worked for me but i will try their one more product definitely for my extra dry hair</li>
    <li> I ordered this shampoo after seeing a friends shiny, nice smelling hair. I don&#x27;t have an issue with dandruff, although I do have major dry skin. I decided to order the shampoo anyways because I thought it smelled so good. I used it and am super pleased that I purchased it. My hair is super soft and smells great. I will be trying more products in the future.</li>
    <li> I have really long hair and I try not to wash it everyday. I&#x27;ve developed a dry scalp, funny enough, because of my twice a week washing. This shampoo helped almost immediately. It smells wonderful and it has no sulfates! Its all natural. Its super thick too so you don&#x27;t have to use too much to get a good lather. I&#x27;ve recommended it to all of my friends!</li>
    <li> I have noticed a huge difference in my dandruff problem while using this shampoo.  This is by far the best shampoo I have found yet for my dry scalp.  Anything with sulfate irritates and drys my scalp and this is all natural.</li>
    <li> I think my dandruff got worst after using this product</li>
    <li> I do like it so far... Lets see if it helps with my sensitive scalp.</li>
    <li> I have dandruff problem for over 30 years. Not a single product works consistently well over time. The best ones work in the beginning, then the effect fades out. I started to combine multiple shampoo to seek better result. I found after washing my hair first with whatever shampoo, then wash my hair again with just a little sage shampoo, my dandruff problem is finally under control. Very happy with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> The aroma is calming, stress relieving. Simply put it allows you to relax while the shampoo does it&#x27;s job. The thing that most shocked me was that it worked within the first use. Not to compare but I&#x27;ve continuously tried a variety of other shampoos all which have failed at doing what they claimed to do. However, not this one. Thought I&#x27;d give it a shot and it worked wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it a second time since the first time pretty much nailed it, I ordered Hydrate By Maples Holistic&#x27;s and enjoyed it too. Personally I like the Sage one.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, but didn&#x27;t help my dandruff problem at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different natural solutions for dandruff and this is the only thing that has gotten rid of the flakes. It&#x27;s not 100% but is way more effective then anything else I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m on my third bottle and it&#x27;s still working for me.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a sulfate free dandruff shampoo.  This on is made with natural ingredients, smells fine, and works well.</li>
    <li> Use it as my primary shampoo now! Reduces dandruff significantly, as described. Errs toward a stronger type shampoo that clears any build-up and heaviness from your hair. Does strip hair of oil so a conditioner would be advised unless dry, rough, and harsh hair is desired.</li>
    <li> no shampoo has been able to help with my dandruff... enter sage shampoo - it&#x27;s the only shampoo that has managed to keep my scalp and hair clear of itchiness and flaking. i highly recommend and use this shampoo exclusively. i thought i could get away with going back to head and shoulders, but it isn&#x27;t the case. sage shampoo is the only one that works for me! bonus that it&#x27;s cruelty free and has great ingredients.</li>
    <li> Solid product. All natural, does what it says.</li>
    <li> My reasoning for giving this shampoo a four star rating is due to a couple of things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, the shampoo is definitely made with some raw ingredients because the moment you open it you are almost caught off guard by the aroma. It&#x27;s very strong and sharp to the nose at first, but after awhile it smells fresh and comforting. I could definitely tell that it felt different on my scalp than other products I&#x27;ve used in the past. I was honestly very hopeful that this would finally be the end to my dandruff problem!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my second reason is also why I gave a four star instead of a five star. After closely following the directions and using the product for a couple weeks, my dandruff is still in full force. I love how the product feels on my head, but the sad truth remains that it just hasn&#x27;t taken out my dandruff. I would continue to buy this product but it&#x27;s a little pricey for me. I&#x27;m also continuing to doubt that there is a product out there that will allow me to put an end to my dandruff.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had it for very long but I can already see it starting to help, I also love the way it smells, really good shampoo. I will be buying more when I run out.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  My son hasn&#x27;t complained about the scent or anything.  I think its doing its job so far.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> This is a shampoo that I have been using for a few years now. I can say that dandruff is not a big problem for me now because of this shampoo.</li>
    <li> i was so excited to try this product out from all the positive reviews. So i decided to go for it. I have dandruff and I would be over joyed and wouldn&#x27;t care for the amount of money to spend as long as it would work.  i got the shampoo on time which is great, packages was good, bottle OMG SOOO Small!!! not for the price because the 20 bucks for a small bottle was depressing. BUT hey at that point i didn&#x27;t care about the amount as long as it would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the shampoo as directed and it SMELLED!!! i was grossed out by the smell but than again i kept saying as long as it would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a HALF a Day i started getting dry scalp again! NOTHING LIKE THE FEED BACKS SAID!&lt;br /&gt;Im so upset!&lt;br /&gt;So now i bought a small bottle, that smelled gross to me and the shampoo does nothing for my dandruff!!!! im out 20 bucks!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT WORTH BUYING!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW Would not have given a star but had no choice!</li>
    <li> Amazing shampoo. First day of using and my scalp and hair is dandruff free. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone suffering from dandruff or itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> It helps but did not provide a long term solution</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about six months now, along with a heated coconut oil massage every couple of days and an aveda conditioner. Six months ago, my hair was a disaster, incredibly oily, extremely itchy, and the dandruff was like snow, here there and everywhere. I have been to numerous dermatologists, I&#x27;ve tried horrible -shampoos, drops, horrible smelling things - you name it in an attempt to reduce the disaster that was my scalp, but all of it only left me tired, defeated, and depressed.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately there has been no happy ending, I wish I could say the dandruff and the itching is completely gone, but it hasn&#x27;t. But what has happened is an incredible improvement in the condition of my hair, it&#x27;s thicker, healthier, and though I still have flakes, they are no where near close to the dandruff apocalypse that was my scalp before. Another wonderful note about his shampoo is that this will be second bottle, as in I&#x27;ve been using one bottle for the last six + months and I still have some left over. I&#x27;m not sure if I was using the right quantity, or not washing my hair&lt;br /&gt;enough for it to be gone, but since my hair has improved so much with this routine, I don&#x27;t much care, and! I only have to buy shampoo and conditioner every six months!&lt;br /&gt;So to my fellow apocalypse survivors, winners, still struggling - ers, go ahead and give this shampoo a try...I can&#x27;t promise a miracle cure  but I can guarantee that at the very least, you won&#x27;t be damaging your hair, or frying your scalp with concoctions that no beast let alone woman should be applying to their bodies. Best of luck!</li>
    <li> Treats my oily hair problem and dandruff well. If I stop taking it for 2+ days it begins to come back so a bottle only last 1.5 months. It&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
    <li> At first I thought this shampoo was not working (I was using it twice a week) but now I am using it every other day and I can finally say that my dandruff is going away! The smell is great and I love the fact that it is sulfate-free. It is pricey but you don&#x27;t need too much product to wash your hair anyway!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;My dandruff has come back and now it&#x27;s worse. Just when i started seeing progress with this shampoo, the problem got worse all of a sudden! I still love the smell though but i won&#x27;t order again ):</li>
    <li> It defintley helped but I wish it was a little stronger.&lt;br /&gt;I do get lots of compliments on how good my hair smells!</li>
    <li> Seems to improve flakes and itchy scalp issues, maybe not quite as well as &amp;#34;tar&amp;#34; type shampoos I&#x27;ve used. But it does work and it smells and feels a whole lot better than the others. I think I will buy again.</li>
    <li> This product is Awesome and I love the smell to. You will not be disappointed at all by buying this product!</li>
    <li> This product was given to me and I loved it. I will definitely be buying more. I&#x27;ve always had a problem with dandruff and not much luck with other products but this starts working pretty quick. The only negative comment I have it my scalp started itching again not long after running out, but that&#x27;s my fault not the shampoos.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried using tea tree oil in my shampoo, just using baking soda, rinsing with apple cider vinegar and I still experience dandruff. I&#x27;ve only used this shampoo twice now, but my scalp feels less itchy and I think I am noticing less flakes. I will need to give it some more time but I have to say, so far so good. I also enjoy the herbal scent.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a natural dandruff remedy that works. A friend recommended this product line and I am extremely grateful! This product really helps my itchy scalp and dandruff. Thanks Maple Holistics.</li>
    <li> Was hoping this would do the trick, but it is at best as effective as the much cheaper store brand of Selsun Blue I have used.  Next time I&#x27;ll buy 4 bottles of that and save myself some money.</li>
    <li> I bought several of these Maple Holistics shampoos and a conditioner because I was looking for something better for my dry, curly, coarse hair. I usually have to put a ton of product/oil on my hair after washing, but this stuff is amazing! My hairdresser asked me for the name of the product yesterday. She&#x27;s been cutting my hair for over 10 years and she could tell the difference after just a month! I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I have tried many things to alleviate my itchy scalp to no avail. After only using this shampoo for a couple of weeks, I can already feel it working.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. Leaves my hair shiny and soft. Helped my dry scalp</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  I don&#x27;t have much hair, so I&#x27;m more concerned with how my scalp feels, and it feels great after I use this.  Seems like the skin is less dry.  There is no minty gimmick that makes my scalp tingle, but doesn&#x27;t do anything long term, this just goes on, rinses off, and I feel comfortable.  A small dab lathers up in my hands, providing plenty of shampoo to massage into my hair and scalp (again, not much hair to spread it over).</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this shampoo due to all the positive reviews I read. But unfortunately this shampoo did not do much for my dandruff. I still have a lot of flakes and dandruff and have not seen a significant difference. I will keep on searching for one that will work.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!  It works.  My scalp was itchy, the dandruff was driving me crazy.  I have used this shampoo for two weeks and there is a huge difference:  basically the dandruff is about gone, my scalp is hardly ever itchy, and my hair is soft and full.  I will definitely continue using.</li>
    <li> WOW. I just got my bottle Sage and the Silk Conditioner. I have only used each product once but WOW. AMAZING. I have shoulder length fine, wavy, oily hair. I dry shampoo every other day which has caused some dry flakiness to occur on my scalp all around my face and right a the top of my hair. This stuff is unbelievable. My hair made it all day without getting super greasy-I think this was due to the sage! It was so shiny and soft-I think thru&#x27;s was due to the silky conditioner! I was a little worried when I used the sage bc of the organic smell but it honestly wasn&#x27;t too bad once my hair dried. I will be trying other items!!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first receiving the product as nothing that claimed &amp;#34;be dandruff free&amp;#34; has worked before.  But, to my surprise, I used the product only once and waited a full day to see the condition of my hair.  The dandruff was reduced by at least 90%.  I walked around rubbing my hair all day and could not believe that hardly anything came out.  What a truly awesome product.  I found my last shampoo!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 months straight and it improve my hair.  It fought most of the dandruff out and I can see my hair more healthy.  I am going to have their conditioner to improve even more!</li>
    <li> Smells great.  Did not work in ridding my dandruff.</li>
    <li> Using other retail shampoos makes my dandruff and dermatitis flair up terribly. This product doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp. I&#x27;m using it conjunction with another product to keep my itchy, dandruff scalp clear and calm.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for almost a year now and my dandruff hasn&#x27;t come back yet. I think it helped me got rid of it for good and I am very grateful for that. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Sage has been a good buy, It&#x27;s gotten rid of my dandruff when head and shoulders did nothing for me but the scent is very &#x27;earthy&#x27; which I don&#x27;t care for but that isn&#x27;t such a problem.</li>
    <li> Sage Shampoo for Heavy Dandruff with Argan, Jojoba and Organic Spikenard&lt;br /&gt;My daughter uses this for her dandruff and she has only used it for a few days, so not sure that it is helping yet. But she said her hair feels clean and it does not look greasy like the other store bought shampoos look in her hair. looks and feels cleaner using sage shampoo. Thanks she love this shampoo</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a great smell of natural oils of the best mixture. Great for men or women, and doesn&#x27;t leave a strong scent after washing your hair with it. It is a great everyday shampoo, and has worked great for me. I will continue to use this product, and can&#x27;t wait to try out other products from this company!</li>
    <li> Its working for me well. Dandruff did not vanish completely but I only used it thrice. May be after few more uses it would work really well.</li>
    <li> Really effect and instant improvement. Definitely recommend it to people gave similar problems</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many dandruff shampoos which would either strip my hair dry and make it brittle or simply didn&#x27;t stop the flaking, etc.  I decided to give this shampoo a try based on a quick amazon search and reading these reviews.  After a few weeks my dandruff has decreased to the point where I don&#x27;t even detect any and I only need to wash my hair every other day, my hair isn&#x27;t greasy and feels healthy finally!  Very glad I found this stuff and anyone who suffers from dandruff and is looking for a natural shampoo which won&#x27;t dry out their scalp should give this a try.</li>
    <li> This shampoo really took me by surprise! I am so sensitive to sulfates and fragrance and my scalp has no shame in reacting. My scalp loves the natural ingredients and I didn&#x27;t have an itch for 2 days! Unbelievable! The scent is really good too. I thought it would be gross, but it&#x27;s actually pretty peaceful. Smelled fresh and my husband totally agrees! He tried it and loves it, too! While in the shower, I followed the directions and left it on for 3mins, while I bathed and shaved my legs. As I washed it out, my hair felt really weird...is dry the right word? IDK. I was worried. I continued to use another natural conditioner, on my ends only. My hair when I rinsed was fine after. I again, followed directions and left my hair to dry for about 5-10mins. After blow drying, my hair was so soft! It smelled good and like I said before, there were no reactions!! Hallelujah!! Is it a little pricey? Yes, but how much freakin money do we spend trying to find a product that will leave our scalp healthy, smell good, and leave our hair in excellent condition?! I&#x27;m so happy, with this product already, I can&#x27;t wait to find the conditioner to match!! I&#x27;ve been searching! (My only complaint)</li>
    <li> I just received my second bottle of this shampoo.  I had been looking for a really high quality organic shampoo for a long time.  I saw this shampoo online and decided to give a try.  Honestly, this is the best one ever!  I am very happy with it, and I know that I will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> This shampoo works great on my eczema / scalp flare ups. I love that it doesn&#x27;t contain harmful ingredients! Smells great too!</li>
    <li> First shampoo that ever worked for me. Buy it best shampoo i have ever purchased!</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and the combination of dry hair and oily scalp makes shopping for proper shampoo a hard task.  I get itchy and flaky scalp when the shampoo doesn&#x27;t clean well enough, or cleans too much! !  I have been using this shampoo for two weeks now.  Although it seems to be a small bottle, this shampoo lathers up really well so a little goes a long way.  While it effectively reduces scalp itchiness and dandruff, it&#x27;s not that over-drying as most good deep cleansing shampoos are.  I usually use some coconut or jojoba oil at the end of my hair so it&#x27;s easier to de-tangle it after shower without pulling too much hair out.  Overall I really like the smell, the texture, the lathering, and the effectiveness of this shampoo!</li>
    <li> I have only used this twice so far but I could tell a difference after the first shampoo.  I have had severe dandruff my entire life sense my teen years and have tried everything! Some worked in the beginning but would soon stop helping.  I have extremely thick hair and after 5 babies it has become very oily on top of the dandruff problem.  I was able to go 3 days before I shampooed again and even then I did it only because i knew it needed it not because it was so greasy.  All the dandruff is not completely cleared but I have high hopes!  I will update my review after continued use.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Not a cure but definitely has reduced the amount of flaking and redness in my skin. It does leave my hair kind of dry so I need to find a conditioner to go on after.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is absolutely amazing! I was using another natural shampoo and it just was not getting rid of the dandruff. My hair also felt &#x27;stripped&#x27; with the other shampoo. With Sage it feels healthy and nourished. I have yet to find any shampoo that is even close to this, natural or synthetic. After the first shampoo my dandruff was gone and has yet to return. Maple Holistics knows what they are doing! If you have dandruff this is a must have! The smell is a little bit different, being natural. It is still good, just don&#x27;t purchase it expecting a fruity smell.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t know where the good reviews come from. My family have used natural hair and skin care products for years, and this product is just a marketing trick. It has very strong surfactants which give people accustomed to conventional shampoos the lather they are used to, plus a few essential oils. The essential oils are well chosen for dandruff in theory but in practice the amount here is not enough to make any difference in my husband&#x27;s dandruff (which responded very well to the Jason anti-dandruff shampoo). I only use anti-dandruff shampoos on occasion for a deeper cleaning of buildup, but after I used this unappealing product, I had an afro! Super drying and frizz producing. And I didn&#x27;t have the clean-scalp feeling I was after. There is also nothing homeopathic about this product, if you have any idea what homeopathy or homeopathic remedies are about.</li>
    <li> After a continuous search for a natural shampoo, I stumbled upon Maple Holistics. They had amazing reviews and I decided to give them a shot. I washed my hair when it was at its worst (after a day at the horse stables), and the end result was great.You actually do not need that much product, as you get a really smooth lather from just a little shampoo and water. If you don&#x27;t mind the herbal smell, it is actually quite relaxing and refreshing. I also suffer from eczema, which can cause my skin to react after using some products. I didn&#x27;t get any flare-ups, and there seemed to be less dead skin on my scalp. However, I did still need to use conditioner as it wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough without. After my hair dried, it was light, soft, and airy. It&#x27;s very reasonably priced, too!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a month now.  I have noticed a slight improvement in my hair but still notice some dandruff appearing from time to time.  The smell is really great and overall it is worth a shot to see if it works for you.</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic about this product, but since I am nursing and tend to try to limit my chemical exposure for the sake of my child (which is pretty much the only time I do this), I decided to give it a try. Now, I really followed the directions and massaged it into my scalp and left it on for a few minutes, and repeated, but  this stuff really worked! It also smells really good and hasn&#x27;t dried my hair out. I do have processed hair, so that&#x27;s always a concern.  It&#x27;s lasted really long as well, which is important to me.  Did I mention that it smells good?</li>
    <li> Smells nice and seem to be working so far..Been using it for almost 2 weeks now and my dandruff has lessened,</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s winter time, and in the winter my hair gets the worst kind of dandruff. I bought this hoping it would get rid of it, but it didn&#x27;t. It definitely did make it a lot better but didn&#x27;t completely get rid of it.</li>
    <li> After so many great reviews, I was hoping this would be my natural way to help my dry, red, itchy dandruff. But Im sorry to say, it has not helped at all. I did not want to go back to the prescription shampoo but I think I&#x27;ll have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is also very small for the price. It barely lasted me two weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m having a hard time with dry, flaky scalp. I have rosacea on my face and scalp, and the water where I&#x27;m living temporarily has a lot of chlorine in it that irritates my skin. I&#x27;ve tried expensive Aveda shampoos, Selsun Blue in a couple of varieties and now this. Of all the shampoos I&#x27;ve got scattered around the tub, this one is the most effective. It leaves my hair shiny clean, and, while the dandruff is not completely under control, I think it will be when I install the filter I just bought for the shower.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo after reading other reviews.  I have color treated hair and had difficulties finding an sulfate free shampoo that would help with my dandruff.  I heard all positive reviews about this product, and I must say, they were all correct.  The product has  helped my scalp tremendously and I would recommend this to others!  The only issue I have with the shampoo is the smell.  I don&#x27;t particularly like the fragrance it has.  It is an all natural shampoo and it definitely smells that way.  This really has no affect on the quality of the shampoo, so I just deal with it! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This product arrived very quickly. Smelled wonderful and provides an EXCELLENT lather!  It did in fact help with the itching and dandruff but I guess I have a more stubborn issue.  I do recommend it and the scent is earthy and nice, not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now, seems to be working well with consistency.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this shampoo! I had been suffering from dandruff since getting a keratin treatment and was having difficulty finding a sulfate free dandruff specific product.  THIS IS IT!  My hair looks great, shampoo smells fantastic and I love that it is all natural with few ingredients.  total fan!</li>
    <li> This shampoo actually works. Got rid of almost all of the dandruff after just one use and hair felt much softer. Would recomend it for men and women.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best dandruff shampoos out there. I have a lot of dandruff and I have tried Selsun Blue, but I finished it and it didn&#x27;t really help. Then I found this Sage Shampoo on Amazon that I ordered. I used it about twice and then my dandruff decreased about 75%. Before, everyone was saying to me, what is that white stuff in your hair? Now, you can barely notice it and its not a problem to me anymore.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why my scalp chemisty changed, but suddenly I always had dandruff no matter how long I stopped shampooing or how often I did shampoo. No change in schedule or shampoos changed that. My scalp was always itchy and scratching it hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE SHAMPOO...immediately I felt relief and saw a dramatic reduction in flakes. I don&#x27;t typically shampoo every day so I&#x27;m waiting for the second shampoo, but I can tell you already that even inbetween shampoos, my scalp feels so much better and LOOKS so much better. SO happy I found this!</li>
    <li> I have, for several years now, suffered with extremely dry scalp, when I say extremely dry, I am not exaggerating! And it seemed to be getting worse and worse and nothing helped and I tried every store bought product for it out there and none of them touch it. I tried every natural shampoo I thought would work, and even made my own and absolutely nothing helped it and I believe made it worse. I even tried oils on my scalp, and they did nothing for it.. I was desperate and could hardly stand it anymore, I knew there had to be something out there somewhere and then  by accident I found Sage Shampoo. I was skeptical and it was a little pricy, but I thought I would give it a try I certainly had nothing to lose.. I didn&#x27;t give a review right away, I wanted to use it a few times to see how it worked, so I could give an honest one. I was not disappointed this is the best shampoo I have ever used and that is no exaggeration either! The first shampoo and my flaky scalp improved, I was amazed! Second shampoo, and the flakes are almost gone. Third shampoo, the flakes are gone, my scalp looks and feels healthy.. I also, like the way my hair feels and the body it gives it, I could not be more satisfied with my purchase! I could not believe it, I have suffered with it for years and at times gave up. This shampoo is worth every penny spent, Thank you I am very happy!</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. I&#x27;ve used Head and Shoulders for years to control the itching dermatitis I&#x27;ve had since I was a teenager. Wanted a sulfate-free alternative, so I tried this. For me, it was worth the price because I have fine hair and I didn&#x27;t need to use much of the product for a lather. I like the scent, and it made my hair feel soft and healthy. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to do much for my scalp, but it definitely helped control the itching. I&#x27;ll be purchasing this from now on.</li>
    <li> First of all I love the fact that the ingredients used in this shampoo are environmentally friendly and super safe to use. That being said, I was not in love with the product itself. I followed the direction exactly, and used it twice each time i washed my hair but it didnt seem to do the trick for me. I have since switched to Redken Dandruff Control Shampoo and it has done wonders. The Sage Shampoo seems to be working for tons of other people so I do believe it is a good product but it may work on some and not on others depending on the type of dry scalp each one has.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is really amazing...not even sure where to begin....The smell is a very &amp;#34;herbal&amp;#34; kind of scent...it smells like lavender to me...I really love it...the texture is very thick and the lather is very luxurious...I have fine curly hair that tangles really badly and this shampoo gave me no issues with that..If anything it helped me with the detangling process...I also have moderate to severe seborrheic dermatitis,eczema and contact dermatitis.It is helping to keep those conditions under control....It is hard to find a sulfate/silicone free shampoo that actually lives up to what it claims and this is IT.The only negative I would have to say is that it is pretty pricey for the amount you get but I don&#x27;t mind spending the extra money on something that genuinely works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting a long time for a natural dandruff shampoo that works. This is it.</li>
    <li> Super happy with shampoo. Like that is natural and works very well. After trying several products over the last couple of years and always feeling disapointed, I am satisfied with this result. Controlled the flakes and itching. Botanical smell. Will definetly continue using as long as I can keep getting this results.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is very effective for an itchy flaky scalp, the oils in it also leave my hair very smooth. I guess you get what you pay for. I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Another dandruff product that doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of products over the years and this one is no different unfortunately. Gave no reduction or relief to chronic dandruff.</li>
    <li> This product is really great.  Love the smell and that it is all natural ingredients and best of all it is really working on my itchy scalp problem.  I think I have finally found the perfect shampoo for my scalp problem.</li>
    <li> Wow! First time i used it i noticed a diffrence in my hair. Less dandruff and hairloss, best product i have ever purchased.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well.  My hair is soft after using it.  Plus feels really clean.  I still see some flakes, but not at the extent I did before.  As far as being able to control the flakes with a  natural product this has worked the best for me, compared to other lines I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> THEE ONLY product on the market that actually helps with dandruff, AND, not specifically for oily or dry hair - it just Normalizes it perfectly</li>
    <li> Cured my dandruff in just a few uses. I don&#x27;t even need to use conditioner with this. The smell is refreshing too.</li>
    <li> been using this everyday since i received it and it has done nothing.&lt;br /&gt;dandruff still there and my scalp is still very itchy.&lt;br /&gt;if there is a zero star, that&#x27;s what i will give.</li>
    <li> Washed my hair twice already with this product and my dandruff is almost gone love it. It does&#x27;t smell all that great but works telling all my friends . It is worth every dime</li>
    <li> This is a product that works for me. I tried Paul Mitchell Tea Tree one and worked only to get the itch out after the shower and it came back the next day. This sage shampoo takes the itchiness really well for days. I still have some dry scalp but it is waaaay less.</li>
    <li> Pretty nice product that works quite well for extreme cases of dandruff. A bit harsh on hair but this could be offset using a conditioner. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It literally smells like it was picked from an exclusive garden and managed to get all the nutrients inside this capsule! It smells and feels good, I already have the rest of my family using it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for 2 months now, about 3 times per week. Although it doesn&#x27;t eliminate the dandruff 100%, it comes pretty close. It did eliminate the itching altogether which is a big plus for me. I&#x27;ve used all the over the counter brands and they don&#x27;t work as well as this one. The smell is very pleasant, unlike some store brands. I&#x27;m happy with the results and will be purchasing again. I purchased it directly from Maple Holistics web site, as they gave me free shipping without a minimum purchase amount to worry about.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good dandruff shampoo for a long time when I saw this one and decided to try.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very good and the hair doesn&#x27;t get too dry like the other dandruff shampoos does.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately on my trip to Hawaii, TSA seized my shampoo due to the size (my mistake). I was extremely sad because the bottle was practically full.&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo after researching the impact of sulfates on skin, because I have battled with patches of migrating eczema on the back of my neck and on certain sections of my scalp. I had used drug store shampoos for years, and for the past two or so, I had red, scaly patches of skin on my scalp near my ears, and on the back of my neck and above. My hair is also very fine and delicate, so finding something to treat my eczema while not wreaking havoc on my hair was very difficult, and this shampoo thus far has been the best solution I&#x27;ve found. The Dermarest shampoo I used previously, white treating the eczema was far too damaging to my hair. I&#x27;ve been using Maple Holistic&#x27;s Sage Shampoo since I purchased it in April, and it&#x27;s cleared up about 75% of my eczema issues, while being gentle on my very thin hair. It leaves my scalp feeling very clean, and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. I plan to continue to use this shampoo, however, my only complaint is that I have to use a bit more than the recommended amount of product. But this may be because I have fairly long hair. Overall, I would definitely recommend this product, and I don&#x27;t think I can ever go back to drug store brands again.</li>
    <li> I have a severely itchy scalp and pretty bad dandruff. I&#x27;ve tried every dandruff shampoo out there and even tried prescription treatments from a dermatologist. This shampoo has helped better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. The only reason I don&#x27;t give 5 stars is because I do still have flakes and itching, just way less than before. I like the way it smells. My hair looks better and feels better than it has in years. I&#x27;ll keep using this unless I find something that completely eliminates the itch and flakes.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells little strong for me and it makes my hair dry.</li>
    <li> Been using it for a week now and even after the first use, my dandruff was significantly improved after the first wash.&lt;br /&gt;I can wear black again! haha</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from itchy and dry, flaked scalp for God-knows-how-long and have never found a solution until my derma recommended this. I  was a bit skeptical at first, thinking that if branded and expensive shampoos won&#x27;t work, what are the odds that this would work. I didnt see the point in wasting money again so he offered to buy one for me. Fine, I agreed. And I&#x27;m glad I did. Goodbye to itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> I have had dry scalp for 10+ years and gets worse during the winter seasons. Tried several allopathic and herbal shampoos and conditioners. Nothing worked. I could see significant difference by using this shampoo along with Silk 18 conditioner.Almost free of itching now. Hard to understand the Ingredients list but hoping its all natural.</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s all natural and helps big deal with my dermatitis. It leaves my hair feeling clean and fresh all day and with a great smell. I have been using this for nearly half a year. It has never failed to impress me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a few weeks now and I have seen a decrease in the amount of dandruff. This shampoo is great! I love the smell and it&#x27;s all-natural ingredients. The one thing I would say is that it didn&#x27;t really help with the itching, but dandruff was my main issue anyways! All in all, this was a great product!</li>
    <li> After using this shampoo for the very first time, i could visibly notice the improvement in my scalp health. Not only did it reduce the itchy flaky scalp caused by the very dry winter season, it also managed to reduce the hair loss associated with the above condition. Absolutely love the gentle yet powerful ingredients like tea tree and rosemary which are naturally anti bacterial/fungal and moisturizing ingredients. I highly recommend this product to anyone with troubled scalp, although I would recommend using this product occasionally rather than a daily shampoo simply because it can be a little drying. I would highly recommend other shampoos from Maple holistic for daily use and the sage shampoo more for a weekly treatment.</li>
    <li> Product worked great to eliminate my dandruff. Saw a huge difference after the first use. The only downside is that it is very drying due to surfactants in the product. Follow up the shampoo with a very quenching conditioner and that helps.</li>
    <li> I just received this product and after just one use I noticed a big difference.  My scalp was so itchy it almost hurt and after just an hour after showering my scalp would flake so bad...  after using it this morning it feels better than it has all week and the flakes are still there but much less.  I am excited to keep using this and alternating it with some other shampoos I just ordered from Maple Holistics.</li>
    <li> I have used Biolage for years and noticed buildup on hair that declarifying products do not seem to remove, decided to try something different. Tried this with plastic shower cap to penetrate and works great! Little goes long way and is intense as a specialized shampoo should be concentrated. I will use periodically and seems to be another great product from this company!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for last three months now and I LOVE IT! It not only smells good but also takes care of the dandruff and my hair looks and feels healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I had been trying various expensive products with little to no results and started noticing loss of hair as well. Luckily, I did a search on Amazon for &#x27;best dandruff shampoo which is also all natural&#x27; and gave Sage a shot..And I am one happy customer!! There is no dandruff and hair feels great, even my husband noticed it!!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing :-)</li>
    <li> Smells good and works great! Would definitely recommend to others. Knowing there are no harsh chemicals is important to me and this fits the bill! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo with hope that it would help my dandruff that comes along with having dry skin that also flakes constantly without a lot of attention.  Even though I am a middle aged guy and I was initially worried a little about the aroma following me around, I love the powerful herbal scent which has some aroma-therapeutic effect on me when I shower.  My fears were allayed when I found that after rinsing, the odor is not noticeable.  The shampoo lathers very well and I follow the unique instructions including allowing a little soak time, finishing my rinses with a cold blast of water, massaging my scalp, and not blow drying (never did that anyway).  I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks so far and have noticed some improvement, although the flakes are not totally gone.  I&#x27;m going to give it a little more time before reaching a final verdict on the dandruff.  I will probably keep using the shampoo regardless because I really like it!</li>
    <li> I bought this not hoping to cure my dandruff, although that would have been nice, but I was hoping it would at least help. It smells really nice and I felt like it got my hair clean and didn&#x27;t dry it out but it made my dandruff a little worse and halfway through the day after washing my hair I start to get a little itchy. This may just not be the right product for what I need.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far and it has already made a difference in my hair. My scalp feels relieved and I&#x27;m not itchy. I plan to use it a few more times and write another review. So far so good! I like the smell also.</li>
    <li> I had the worst dandruff problems and after using this shampoo for just two times, the dandruff has reduced drastically.Now, I use this shampoo every week twice and happy with a dandruff free hairs. Also hairs are more silky and shiny and hair loss is also reduced. My main cause of hair loss was heavy dandruff since last 4 years. I wish I could have found this shampoo 4 years back, I could have saved my hairs from loosing. Still its not late. I recommend this shampoo to anyone who has heavy dandruff problems.</li>
    <li> I am 34 years old and have dry skin but have never had dandruff, until about 9 mos ago. It started gradually and has become full blown, itchy, and flaky. I&#x27;ve tried the usuals: Head &amp; Shoulders, Tea Tree oil shampoos, and Biolage pyrithione zinc. None of the effects would last more than 1 day, and worst of all, the itchy scalp remained. If you have suffered from severe dandruff, you know how embarrassing it is to be constantly trying to sneak a scratch of your head. The SAGE shampoo definitely works. My hair is extra thick and long so I wash 2x&#x27;s with any shampoo. The SAGE shampoo calms my scalp, rids it of flakes, and the effects last 2-3 days on average. My only concern is the price and the small size of the bottle. For $18 a pop I would like to get almost double the size.</li>
    <li> Really love this product it has helped greatly with my scalp issues. I use it 3 times a week and it has made a huge difference. Will definitely be using this from now on.</li>
    <li> I first tried this shampoo at a friends house. I absolutely love this! I like that it is made in the USA. Great quality product without all the sulfate, and other cancer causing ingredients that the other shampoos have.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo.  I also use this on my face a couple times a week to help with adult acne.</li>
    <li> My husband has been battling dandruff for years, he has gone through countless shampoos and treatments. I don&#x27;t like all the chemicals in the usual shampoos but holistic shampoos or natural remedies don&#x27;t always seem to work either, until I got this. I took a chance and now this is all he uses and it has completely taken care of everything! It has light and fresh scent is not harmful to the skin. Its been amazing and the perfect anti-dandruff shampoo.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband who has severe dandruff and I wanted a natural, organic solution. And this does help significantly - did it get rid of it completely? no. At least, not yet. The longer he&#x27;s been using it, the more it seems to be improving, so maybe in time it&#x27;ll help to clear it all up. Oh yeah, and it smells pretty great!</li>
    <li> I used this for 2 weeks and it works cool no dandruff at all, recommended product for all who are suffering with dandruff</li>
    <li> I have been using the shampoo for about one week. I bought the shampoo because 1/ I have dandruff  2/ I have highlights&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;1/ The product delivers on its anti-dandruff property. I have much less dandruff if any after only one week using this product.&lt;br /&gt;2/ The product have some color protecting effect. I have some highlights. It has not faded the color on the highlights so far.&lt;br /&gt;3/ Much less drying. This product does not purge my hair like most shampoo. It leaves my hair soft and smooth after a wash. that is an improvement from the other shampoos when I d have to use a conditioner to get back the softness and smooth hair.&lt;br /&gt;4/ Feels great with some scalp message. I feel relaxed after using this shampoo. It feels a little minty on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;1/ leaves an herbal medicinal smell, which I personally do not like.&lt;br /&gt;2/ High price. The shampoo comes in a small bottle. For its price, the product seems expensive even after pricing in an all natural mark-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product for a hefty price. You will not be disappointed with the product except for the price.</li>
    <li> This does a pretty good job at keeping my itchy scalp and dandruff away!  I still get a little every now and then, so it&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s good!  It is very thick and suds up really well--which surprises me being that it&#x27;s supposed to be sulfate free.  The smell is very earthy and strong, but I like it.  And I&#x27;ve never smelled it after my hair is dry.  I have dry, curly hair so I use this on my scalp every 2 to 3 days.  I try not to use much shampoo on the rest of my hair to keep it from drying out too much.  I don&#x27;t think this has made my hair more dry, and I have yet to find a dandruff (or regular) shampoo to soften my mane, so as long as it doesn&#x27;t dry it out and keeps my dandruff from being embarassing, I&#x27;m pretty happy!</li>
    <li> We regularly purchase the sage shampoo from Maple Holistics because it really works!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for the whole family!</li>
    <li> This stuff worked for me. I have been a chronic dandruff sufferer for years now. Like, quality of life affecting. I tried all nearly everything and nothing seemed to work. I got this shampoo and after two uses my dandruff died down to a manageable level. I made the mistake of &#x27;trying&#x27; some normal conditioner after using this stuff for a couple of weeks and my dandruff exploded again. So, I&#x27;m back to solely using the shampoo every couple of days or so and I feel so much better about my hair. Also, it smells pretty dang good and doesn&#x27;t sting your scalp in any way.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this shampoo. It smells great, gives volume to my hair and seems like it is making my hair thicker. I have been using it for 3 weeks now and I am free of flakes and dandruff. After this gets finished, I will surely purchase it again. Highly recommended !!</li>
    <li> It worked better than the supermarket competition on the first try and I like the smell more, too! I will definitely be using this from now on. I&#x27;ve found that I have to wash my hair less frequently now that I&#x27;ve started using it. It worked for my dandruff.</li>
    <li> No more flakes. NO MORE FLAKES!</li>
    <li> I have occasional plaques of thick, dry scalp that ordinarily only resolves with products like Nizoral and other really harsh chemical treatments.  I have used a salon rebalancing product with some success but it involves an hour long process and doesn&#x27;t have perfect results.  Recommendations from the dermatologist aren&#x27;t safe for double processed colored hair and the addition of a keratin straightening treatment had me more motivated to find something that would be sulfate and paraben free to preserve my expensive hair treatments.  Viola!  I use Sage 2-3 times per week, and always with a scalp brush.  Plaques are gone.  It smells earthy and not medicinal and is really gentle.  I would dare say that with my punished hair, it really softens and conditions.  If you are used to chemical free shampoos, the lather is about the same but leaves your hair feeling great.  Don&#x27;t let the price fool you - a little goes a long way, even on thick, long hair.  I had another shampoo bookmarked to try if this one didn&#x27;t work, no need, this shampoo is my go-to.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo in that it isn&#x27;t drying and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive scalp. I use it everyday now. The reason I bought this is due to my seborrheic dermatitis. I have awful flare ups a few times a year and I needed some relief that didn&#x27;t make make the rest of my scalp irritated or left an awful smell that lasted days, so off to Amazon I went to try and find something yet again. I find that it doesn&#x27;t help much with itching, but it does dry the dermatitis patches out. After a few days the inflammation had went down, even after the first use the inflammation was less, and the area was much dryer and was shedding, so that was a good sign. It cleanses the scalp of build up very well, so that helps with the inevitable shedding as well. The scent is so/so. Not strong, it&#x27;s natural. It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t linger. You can barely smell it in dry hair, it just smells clean.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I saw it has a good reviews, I have heavy Dandruff and I tried many proudects and I can tell that this product is the worse ! it increased my Dandruff like a crazy ! maybe it works for some people but it didn&#x27;t work for me at all ! dont waste your money</li>
    <li> My new natural shampoo of choice!!!!&lt;br /&gt; Great smell and my hair is soft  and clean . I really like this shampoo ,I used to use another natural shampoo but they changed there ingredients and I stopped buying . Decided to try mapleholistics and I really like it a lot. My scalp isn&#x27;t dry and doesn&#x27;t feel irritated . I will be a new customer , just don&#x27;t change a good thing!</li>
    <li> been using it two days my dandruff has been reduced dramatically only bad thing is leaves my hair hard to comb</li>
    <li> I have had issues with an itchy scalp on and off for years. I also have, in recent years, developed rather frizzy hair from coloring and over styling. Not only did this shampoo help with the itchiness but, combined with the SILK 18 Conditioner, my hair is silky soft and finally tame. I also love how it smells! Now I&#x27;m spoiled and will never want to go back to store brands again.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at first, but not anymore! This is a great product and has really helped my dandruff. The smell is alright. It&#x27;s all natural so it has the fragrance of  a hippy just a little bit, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me! It works!</li>
    <li> Amazing products. After 2 washes, my dandruffs disappeared. Im verry happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> The scent is fantastic, but it didn&#x27;t help my dandruff.  I&#x27;ve suffered from dandruff since I was young and though I&#x27;m older and the flakes aren&#x27;t as bad as they were back then, I would say this product only removes 85% of buildup on my scalp. It&#x27;s a good shampoo but, I would go for other remedies for dandruff.</li>
    <li> It works. My wife has constant dandruff problems and &amp;#34;unruly&amp;#34; hair. Tried few shampoo and it always kept creating problems. Just tried Sage shampoo. So far so good. It works and does the intended job. Great product. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost three weeks and I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference on my scalp. Though my hair has been a lot more shinny and healthy looking. But I still have dandruff.</li>
    <li> GREAT ! I had problem with my scap for years.. i always had dandruffs i just used this shampoo once and i had no more, i really recommend it, not sure with works for everyone but try.. for me worked.</li>
    <li> Really liked the shampoo.  Bought it for my mother who is elderly and has Alzheimer&#x27;s.  She is at the stage where she always thinks she washed her hair yesterday - so she had a very bad scalp.  I wanted something gentle that works.  I tried it once to see what it was like - and liked how my hair felt.  My mother&#x27;s scalp has cleared up (I now make sure she washes it at least once a week), and we both use the shampoo.  I&#x27;m going to have to try their other products.</li>
    <li> It id not get rid of dandruff.  Smells nice.</li>
    <li> After months of testing the over-the-counter options for anti-dandruff shampoo, this shampoo was my last attempt before going to the doctor to get a prescription for something stronger.  I&#x27;ve been using the product for 2.5 weeks, and my dandruff has noticeably decreased.  This is the best over-the-counter product I have tested thus far, and it has helped me enough to prevent an unwanted doctor visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Sage shampoo every other day.  On off days, I do not wash my hair.  I&#x27;ve found this method to be most effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using this shampoo.  If my dandruff issue continues to improve, I will come back &amp; adjust this score to a 5/5.</li>
    <li> I love it!! I thought it wasn&#x27;t working at first, but I&#x27;ve used it a couple more times and it is steadily getting rid of my dandruff and itchy scalp. Prior to this I had to get a prescription, but it dried my hair too bad and it was full of chemicals. This resolved that issue. Plus it has protein in it!!! My natural hair loves it!!! It&#x27;s pricey, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> I had dandruff issues  I used to use neutrogena medicated shampoo but using it everyday made my hair lifeless and my hair color use to not stay more than 3 days, when I used my regular dove shampoo my hair continued to have dandruff issues and washing 3 times a day made my hair depleted of its oils because of the sulphates in it and strands of hair used to come in my hands when I washed. It looked dry  , frizzy , itchy. After I used this shampoo my dandruff issues did not  vanish completely but it was so much better jus after two wash. It smelt good and my  hair became full of life again ,very natural  without any feel of high chemical in my head . I could feel that it wasnt dry anymore and I am feeling my hair is healthy .I would recommend it to anybody with dandruff issues , its a mind blowing product . I have already recommended it to many of my friends.</li>
    <li> More dandruff after using all Maple Holistics brand. More Itchy scalp and hair fall. Won&#x27;t be buying again. I wish their products work for me but it didn&#x27;t. I really don&#x27;t want to negative review. Sorry.</li>
    <li> We purchased this shampoo for our child who has severe scalp itch with heavy dandruff. She does appear to be scratching her scalp less often. We will know better in a month how much it has helped. I would still prefer to now the cause of the dandruff and itching b/c the shampoo is very expensive.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for me...</li>
    <li> Great, herbal scent, reduces itching and flaking for me. I have purchased this for the second time, and am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> smell wonderful, i have seborrheic dermatitis and the itch is there every time, in the first try the itch stop, my hair is soft. my head flakes reduce dramatically&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro- smell great, natural ingredients , no sulfates&lt;br /&gt;cons- :/ price, small amount</li>
    <li> I have been having problems with an itchy scalp. I have used store brand dandruff shampoos and moisturizing treatments, as well as baking soda, and Aveda oils with nothing working. So far, this shampoo has worked very well for me. It not only has helped my scalp but it made my hair squeaky clean so that when I used the Silk18 conditioner with it, it immediately bonded to my hair making it instantly smooth. I&#x27;m sold on this amazing product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo, as well as Nizoral, a week and a half ago because my scalp had gotten very bad recently.  Using Nizoral every three days and this shampoo daily my scalp is now back to normal.  One star lost because of the price.</li>
    <li> I have tried several dandruff shampoos for a dry / itchy scalp.  Neutrogena Tar, Head and Shoulders, and Nizoral being a few.  Sage Shampoo for Heavy Dandruff works and smells great.  I have been able to alternate between this and regular shampoo.  It smells good and you only need a small amount.  Although it may seem pricey, it&#x27;s not much more in comparison to some of the high end dandruff shampoos.  Try it out!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Nice, as a shampoo, but doesn&#x27;t really help dandruff at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything and Sage seems to do the best job. I have a naturally dry scalp and have dandruff year around, which isn&#x27;t a lot of fun. Sage absolutely controls it better than any brand name I&#x27;ve found at the supermarket, or anything at a drug store that claims to be all but prescriptive. It&#x27;s natural and contains nothing harsh or chemicals. Try it...it&#x27;s not a lot of money and if you&#x27;ve suffered like I have it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
    <li> Waste of money and inaccurate packaging. Seborrhoeic dermatitis is not a fungus. It&#x27;s dry skin. This won&#x27;t get rid of your dandruff.</li>
    <li> I was pretty desperate for something to take care of my dry, flaky scalp, so I typed &amp;#34;dandruff shampoo&amp;#34; into the search bar and this came up.  I took a chance and I love it!  The smell was different than what I am used to because it is more herbal than flowery, but I learned to love it.  I have very sensitive skin and I am allergic to a lot of shampoos and skin products.  I have been using Sage shampoo since July and haven&#x27;t had any problems.  I recently started using it in combination with their Silk18 conditioner and I have been pleased with the results. Overall, my scalp is much clearer than it used to be and my hair feels healthier.  I realize that not every product will work for every person, but I definitely recommend giving this one a try!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is AMAZING ......I have disgusting dandruff and this got rid of it......I am in love with this shampoo.Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Great Seller Thanks Good product.</li>
    <li> Did not do a whole lot for my scaling.</li>
    <li> Since I started getting Keratin treatments, I noticed that my scalp sometimes became dry and flaky.  I wanted a sulfate-free shampoo that would help my scalp &amp; read reviews on the Sage Shampoo &amp; decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and I&#x27;m really pleased with the results. The shampoo took care of the dry &amp; flaky scalp after the first use and I no longer have the issue.  The shampoo leaves my hair feeling so clean &amp; light.  My hair always looks healthy &amp; full. I&#x27;m also happy with the natural oil ingredients.  It&#x27;s become the only shampoo that I use now.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works great. I got the Brazilian blow out and tried using their sulfate free shampoo brand. It left my scalp in terrible condition. This shampoo cleared it up in days and is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> After working with top dermatologist on my severe dandruff for OVER A YEAR, I decided to spend the same amount I would have paid for a clinic co-pay visit on a variety of shampoos and conditioners here on amazon ($65 worth). Out of everything I tried, this shampoo did the trick and it was apparent after the first use. I still had a little dandruff after day 1, but over time, it continued to improve until I had no more flaking or burning scalp by day 5. A miracle in my opinion. I had tried so many over the counter shampoos, prescription oils and foams, but nothing worked. It seemed it only got worse. My scalp was so irritated from the Zinc and Ketokonazole shampoos it was a relief to use this and feel the cooling effect of what I believe to be the tea-tree oil, even after I rinsed and dried.  I love that it foams really well and contains no Sodium Lauryl Sulfates. The smell of sage, rosemary and tea tree oil linger throughout the day. Definitely give it a try if you are suffering from chronic dandruff.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works as well as any other dandruff shampoo but did not completely take care of my dandruff. The smell, however, is very nice and it leaves my hair feeling very soft.</li>
    <li> Great product without harmful chemicals.</li>
    <li> Pretty good shampoo.  Reduces dandruff to about 1/4 or less of what it is normally, but does not get rid of it.  Still, on par with some of the best natural anti-dandruff shampoo products I&#x27;ve tried (Jason&#x27;s original shampoo brand, for example used to be this way until they switched their formula).  Does not have a high concentration of tea tree oil based on my experience as I don&#x27;t feel the sting on my scalp.  Not saying that having a high concentration is a bad or good thing.  But its just that if you want something that has a high concentration of tea tree oil, I don&#x27;t think this is the right product.&lt;br /&gt;Almost tempted to go non-organic and get paul mitchell&#x27;s version of shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Not all dandruff can be completely be solved with just topical solutions though as far as I know of.  High concentrations of chlorine can dry your skin and hair for example.  An under-active thyroid and dry your skin as well.  Getting too much omega-6 oils in relation to your omega-3 oils can also cause issues, as well as fungal infections.  Genetics might even play a role and even simple dehydration.  Shampoo companies and hair and barber shops tend to push topical solutions to dandruff and dry scalp.  But really the problem is a lot more complicated than just using using a shampoo.</li>
    <li> Works like charm! I just ordered another shampoo from them . Finally I found something that works in my hair. I got rid of all the flakiness and all the dandruff. I use it along head and shoulder classic clean after I use sage and leave it for 3-4 minutes. I am getting few strands of hair back. I will be using this product for long time and see if I will get more hair :) Thanks</li>
    <li> Excellent! I was looking for a shampoo for my dry scalp and dandruff without sulfates. This worked perfectly on my problem.  Just need a very good conditioner as a complement. Also it arrived in great condition and in a timely manner. If I knew I will buy the big bottle.</li>
    <li> Best dandruff shampoo. This is the first natural dandruff shampoo that has worked for me. I had given up trying to find one and consigned myself to Head and Shoulders. I had been using it reluctantly for years. I suffer from mildly dry, flaky scalp with some redness (not sure if its dandruff) and from some of the other reviews, it sounded as if this shampoo was helping people with similar issues as my own. I gave it a try, and after the first use I felt instant relief! No itchiness or redness, and into the second and third day, flakiness was considerably reduced. I have now been using it for 3 months and I can&#x27;t believe how well this shampoo has been working. I have also recently discovered the benefits of tea tree oil and am curious to try the dry scalp shampoo with tea tree oil. I am so glad I found this company, and am planning to try all their products that may serve my needs.</li>
    <li> My son and I both have a very dry scalp. Nothing  has worked until we tried this! This shampoo is amazing and definitely gets rid of the snow flaky scalp!I can&#x27;t  wait to try the conditioner! Oh I also  have color treated hair and have not had any problems!</li>
    <li> The pros for this shampoo are that it has no harsh chemicals and it effectively eliminated my dandruff while I used this shampoo regularly. I discontinued for a couple of weeks and the dandruff is back. It does not provide a long term effectiveness but I will definitely go back to it. The strong smell does not bother me but it could be a turn off for some.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product that has really helped my dandruff and itchy scalp.  I have had this issue for a couple of years (only progressively got worse) and have tried various anti-dandruff shampoos (all over the counter).  I have not tried anything medicated.  Nothing has worked until this. The maple holistics shampoo helped significantly.  The embarrassing white specks are mostly gone and most importantly, the horrible itch is gone as well.  My hair has a silky smooth texture and feels very soft.  This is not the case with many other super luxurious shampoos and the dandruff shampoos only dried my hair out and made it feel stiff/sometimes oily.  Overall, I am very happy with this shampoo and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also mention that while a bit pricey, the bottle goes a long way - it lasted me over 6 months (I wash my hair 2-3 times per week).</li>
    <li> It can help alleviate dandruff but not totally eliminate it</li>
    <li> I have had problems with itchy scalp and seborrheic dermatitis for over ten years. There were always tons of flakes and I could never let my hair grow out, it would just get absolutely horrible. After trying numerous prescription medicines and shampoos which only worked temporarily, or not at all, I finally found this shampoo. It has reduce the scaling and almost eliminated any flaking. I still have slight amounts of flaking but it&#x27;s so much better. If I could give this 10 stars I would. Best. Product. Ever.</li>
    <li> Feels great and works for flakes. Used it two days in a row and it was pretty much cleared up. Smells good too, so I also use it as body wash.</li>
    <li> Although, the smell was somewhat strong first, the shampoo did not leave any afterwards. I like all natural ingredients, and it lathers up very well.</li>
    <li> Did not solve my dandruff issue.</li>
    <li> I received my order in a timely fashion and am very happy with this product. After trying several other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; dandruff shampoos from local department and health food stores with no success and not wanting to go the chemical/alcohol-laden shampoo route  despite mounting pressure from my son due to his frustration with the other natural shampoos, I found this on amazon and bought the first bottle for my son who has had bad dandruff.  His dandruff disappeared within a week and he really likes the way it smells, and when I ran out of my own shampoo (Aveda) I used his and loved the way it made my hair feel... soft and healthy and less frizzy ( I have really thick, kinky, frizzy hair). So this one I bought for me. I definitely will be buying this shampoo for both of us from now on. Thank you for this wonderful, natural product and great customer service!</li>
    <li> It stays true to it&#x27;s name, completely natural. Sad part is why didn&#x27;t I come across this shampoo earlier. It would have helped arrest my dandruff and hair fall. The hair is fuller and silkier. This is especially good for dry skin. They also have different shampoos based on your hair condition. Check it out. You won&#x27;t regret</li>
    <li> After trying the Degrease Shampoo, I wanted to see the other shampoos Maple Holistics had to offer.  I can say I really do enjoy the smell (as i did with the degrease) it is a spicy and uplifting scent that is perfect for shampooing at night.  This shampoo lathered well, and really cleaned my hair and scalp.  My hair felt a little &amp;#34;stripped&amp;#34; when I rinsed it off but I always apply some conditioning pomade after I shower to help style my hair and soothe my scalp anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, shortly after washing drying and styling my hair, there is a certain itch that can be explained as &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34;.  I don&#x27;t know what is is, because my pomade already contains sage so it cannot be that.  My scalp isn&#x27;t producing any dry flakes so It isn&#x27;t over-drying (plus my pomade usually moisturizers/soothes my scalp).  The itch doesn&#x27;t subside until I wash my hair with another one of my shampoos.  I rotate shampoos so I planned on using this every other day, but both times I used this shampoo I had an extremely annoying itch to my scalp until the next time I showered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo may just not be the right fit for me.  My scalp is very  sensitive so I thought this wouldn&#x27;t be as harsh to it than I experienced.  I wanted to continue using this shampoo to see if my results improve, but the itchiness is too uncomfortable.  I recommend this shampoo for folks who want a deep clean with a pleasing night time scent and their scalps are not super sensitive.  I think I&#x27;ll try their Tea Tree Shampoo next, which looks a little more promising.</li>
    <li> Shampoo lathers in well and leaves scalp and hair feeling very clean.  Has definitely helped reduce dandruff after only one weeks use.  Recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo as a last resort, desperate plea for help. I had really bad dandruff and tried almost anything from apole cidar vinegar to selson blue shampoo to help with my scalp problem. Nothing seemed to work. I did a little bit of research on Amazon to help me in my search for a dandruff shampoo that works. I stumbled upon this kind of shampoo and decided I might as well try it. I noticed after a couple days of using the shampoo, my scalp wasn&#x27;t as itchy and irritated as it used to be. And within a week or 2 from buying the product, my scalp wasn&#x27;t itchy and my dandruff was no longer there! I love this product! The smell is a plus too. :)</li>
    <li> Does lessen the amount of dandruff and I like the smell. I use twice a week.</li>
    <li> I have thick, straight, silky oily hair. I guess I have far advanced dandruff or maybe something worse, not that my doctor is any help.  This didn&#x27;t do anything other than cleanse my hair. I loved the smell (I&#x27;m partial to medicinal scents)... this was also very drying and even stripping to my hair, to be fair it was in the range of 1-20 degrees outside when I used it...  If this had been in the $5 range I would have kept it, but for $20, I don&#x27;t think so, I&#x27;ve returned it.  Back to being a slave to Nizoral and their incompetence.  I wish this had worked for me, so I&#x27;m mainly upset that yet another product has failed.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great for the price. It smells really nice and does a good job cleaning my hair and  scalp. I shampoo my hair with it every other day and my hair has never looked more beautiful! I totally recommend using this.</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis on my scalp and bought this product to help relieve the plaque, ugh :( it didn&#x27;t work for me, and in fact I&#x27;d say the psoriasis got worse. I don&#x27;t want to give the product a bad review as I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s helpful to some people.</li>
    <li> Strips all the nastiness from hair. You can truly feel it working on your scalp and hair. My hair changed when we moved to well water. The hard water caused dandruff. Since using this product once a week havent seen any dandruff. Smells amazing</li>
    <li> Highly recommended - never saw anything work this awesome on my hubby</li>
    <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis and a very itchy scalp. I have tried many dandruff shampoos with little relief as most of them contain sulfate, which only aggravates my dermatitis. This shampoo is a miracle in a bottle! It smells fantastic and my scalp itch has decreased significantly after just one use!! It also made my hair very soft, shiny and manageable! The Degrease shampoo is also very good!! Definitely worth the price-even though it&#x27;s a pretty small bottle!!</li>
    <li> My niece recommended this shampoo. I am very happy I bought it. I have had great results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about a month now, and have been switching on and off with the tea tree oil shampoo. My scalp is in the best shape it&#x27;s been in many, many years.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is incrediblle, it feels so luxurious you don&#x27;t ever want to use anything else.  I am using it with the Silk 18 ocnditioiner which is also luxurious and am very pleased.  It is gentle, yet very effective.  I am thrilled that I tried it and thankful for other reviewers who helped me choose to try it!  Thanks for such a great product, Sincerely, Linda Robinson</li>
    <li> Just ok. I didn&#x27;t find that it was that much better than regular shampoo for getting rid of dandruff.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair clean&lt;br /&gt;Definitely improves dandruff situation&lt;br /&gt;Has a slight &#x27;swampy&#x27; scent because of the sage -- I like to use a floral scented conditioner afterwards to make my hair smell better&lt;br /&gt;Overall pleased with product</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but I am extremely pleased. My hair and scalp feel great and I especially like the pleasant smell of the shampoo. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing. You can notice the difference on the first use. I have long hair and it leaves it a bit hard/dry but nothing the  conditioner can&#x27;t take care of.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and foams up well but didn&#x27;t work well for me as I got more dandruff.</li>
    <li> I have read several good and bad reviews about this shampoo but found the negative ones too shady. I went ahead and followed my gut, thinking it wouldn&#x27;t hurt for the price I am paying. My order arrived within 5 weeks and I was excited to try it out! I didn&#x27;t expect it to work right away so I just did what I would normally do on a workday morning. I took a bath using this shampoo, dressed myself and went to work. As I would normally do, I went straight to the restroom upon arriving to the office building and checked out my hair out of a mere hunch. I wasn&#x27;t feeling any itch on the way to work so I was thinking, maybe it&#x27;s starting to work. It surprised me to see that there were no visible flakes at all and when I rummaged my hair. I tried again thinking I was just thinking what I was seeing but it was real!!! I am so happy! This shampoo rocks!!!</li>
    <li> Has really helped with dandruff without messing up my Brazilian blow out! Smells great also. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I never had dandruff problem but as soon as I moved to Seattle, I started having some issues with it. This shampoo does its job well. It does smell a bit different but I think the scent doesn&#x27;t linger for long. So far it has given good results.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and long color treated hair.  I have flaky/dry itchy scalp in the winter and have tried SOOOO many products that do not work at all.  This product has helped a lot; more than most others.  95% of the flakes are gone-  A HUGE improvement from many brands I have tried.  The annoying itchy/dry scalp is gone.  It  leaves my hair soft and smells good.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! Real ingredients and it cleared up scalp issues I&#x27;ve had for years. Win/win.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Maple Holistics Shampoo to help treat and heal my seborrhic dermatitis. I have been dealing with this problem for about 3 years and have had little to no success with other products. It is only on my scalp and causes a lot of painful patches across my scalp. I have very sensitive skin and long hair that is color treated so I have to use products that protect color and are not damaging to my hair. I have tried shampoo&#x27;s, topical steroids, prescription shampoo&#x27;s, other natural shampoo&#x27;s, home remedies etc. I figured I would give this a try based on its other positive reviews. I have used the shampoo twice and the results have literally made me cry (happy tears)! Within hours of using other products the itchiness returned and never went away but so far my scalp feels clean, fresh, and not itchy! I am hoping after a full week some of the sore/open patches will be healed and no new ones will occur. I also purchased the Silk 18 conditioner by Maple Holisitics and I love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel afterwards. I am a true skeptic when it comes to shampoos that claim to help with my scalp issues but in the two times I have used this product, I have already noticed a significant change, which I am hoping with continue.</li>
    <li> I still have a little bit of dandruff, but I must say after using this shampoo 3 times it is getting better! Will definitely keep it up!</li>
    <li> I really loved this product, I had a long time dandruff problem and this solved it. I loved the smell and especially the fact that it was all natural.</li>
    <li> It just works! I am still on my first bottle so I don&#x27;t know for how long it will have this great effect but so far I love this shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has really controlled my dandruff, by it&#x27;s second use scalp felt cleaner and less to no irritation. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my favorite shampoo. It&#x27;s simply the best and only working product for dandruff that I know.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for my dandruff. I love that they use all natural ingredients compared to other dandruff removal products. It&#x27;s much better than even Head and Shoulders (heavy duty) products. However, it leaves my hair feeling really dry and unmanageable (I have really thick, curly, course hair), but my hair restores itself to being manageable after a few days. Probably one of the best hair products I&#x27;ve ever bought, and I will continue to keep buying them.</li>
    <li> An awesome alternative to traditional tar and harsh chemical dandruff shampoos.  This product left my scalp itch free (for about 2-3 days after use) and my hair moist and manageable.  Head and Shoulders (and other similar products) tend to leave my hair dry, though they also manage my irritated scalp.  I hate reading the ingredient list!  Super harsh.  I love that Maple Holistic includes natural/gentle ingredients in their Sage Anti-Dandruff treatment.  In that same line of thinking, the tar based shampoos are stinky and require a lot of wait time.  A friend recently started using Neutrogena&#x27;s T-Gel.  She complained about the harsh smell - I immediately referred her to Sage.  It lathers great, leaves my hair soft, and (other than a slight rosemary/sage scent) smells pleasant.  Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this line and will continue to use this product and try others (Argan, for sure . . .)</li>
    <li> Anti-dandruff shampoos has never been better than this!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE this shampoo. Have been looking for ages for something that really works on dandruff. This did for me. I used it in combination with Beautiful Nutrition&#x27;s &amp;#34;Cleaner Longer Rinse Out Conditioner&amp;#34;, and used together I finally hit the holy grail for hair: no flakes, and soft hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo in hopes that it would finally be the long overdue answer to my dandruff problems and guess what? IT DEFINITELY IS!!!</li>
    <li> It didnt work for me. I almosted used the whole bottle and still have flaking problems.</li>
    <li> I like that it uses more natural ingredients than most other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;I have a bad case of dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say for sure whether this shampoo has reduced it, but i like how it smells.&lt;br /&gt;I would need to try it for a few more months and see.</li>
    <li> Smells great, works great, ALL great!</li>
    <li> Recent Keratin treatment on my hair left me with the challenge of finding a good dandruff shampoo for my treated hair that is also sulfate free. I didn&#x27;t want to damage my now- and newly- fantastic hair, but the flakes were driving me nuts and the provided keratin shampoo did nothing to alleviate my constant need to claw at my scalp. This sage shampoo is the first alternate one I have tried and I am happy to report a huge reduction in the flakes after 3 washes. I wash twice weekly, so it&#x27;s been a week and a half. My head is still itching, but it is far less intense. If it had ridded me of that irritant as well as the flakes, then it would have garnered a 5 star review.</li>
    <li> I have had mild dandruff for most of my adulthood and have tried numerous shampoos over the years. I have found shampoos that worked well fighting the dandruff but left my hair feeling blah. This shampoo not only rid the dandruff but left my hair shiny and full. I had multiple compliments on how healthy my hair looked the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;I have also noticed that my hair seems fuller. My hair is pretty fine and I typically have to use product everyday to give the impression that my hair is thicker than it actually is. Since I have been using this shampoo I rarely use any additional product.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this shampoo makes me very happy!</li>
    <li> Just finished using this shampoo and I must say I love the smell! The lather is rich, the instructions on the bottle are easy to follow and my scalp feels refreshed! I will continue to use this shampoo for my dandruff. I have dreadlocks and find this product a great alternative to chemical filled shampoos to treat my scalp and locs.</li>
    <li> Loved this shampoo as soon as I used this my flakes where reduced by more than half. This was just after first wash.</li>
    <li> Worked in just a few days.</li>
    <li> It just works. For months i have been trying and using this product and it has honestly been the best one I have tried. I keep going back to it and it without fail has gotten rid of the flakes and dandruff. Even if you&#x27;re skeptical, just give it a shot. Your hair and head will thank you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a week and so far so good. My husband and I use neem oil to control dandruff but I got this shampoo for my him since it&#x27;s he who needs a little extra TLC. Maybe it&#x27;s the new ingredients but he said his scalp itches a bit with this one. Maybe it&#x27;s the ingredients his scalp isn&#x27;t used to but we will keep monitoring his scalp itch. He had a life long scalp condition that only neem healed so we still use a few drops of neem with this shampoo as well.&lt;br /&gt;As for me, it makes my hair texture feel softer and smoother than my previous sulfate free shampoo. I like it and the smell is interesting.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is one of the best natural shampoos I&#x27;ve used. It lathers nicely, smells fresh, and my scalp feels healthier. Lasts a long time because it does lather, unlike many natural shampoos.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had zero dandruff after using this for three months. The smell is great and a major plus I&#x27;ve noticed is that I have barely any loose hair anymore. I never have to pick up hair in tub after shampooing and my bathroom only has 3 or 4 strands of hair after styling. It&#x27;s amazing stuff. The price is a little steep for me so I&#x27;m careful to use about a quarter size everytime. I have medium length hair and I still feel like I get a good lather.</li>
    <li> This should be good - haven&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
    <li> I am using this shampoo since 3 weeks. Did not improve my condition. I can still find flakes the same day I wash my hair. It was disappointing as the product is over priced. Still looking for better product to cure my dandruff!!</li>
    <li> I have used Sage Shampoo for several days now and I will definitely purchase again.  Great smell, lathers well.</li>
    <li> I really love this shampoo!  It&#x27;s so soothing!  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of shampoos and treatments (even prescription) for dandruff and dermatitis and none have worked like this has.  It has a pleasant smell, lathers up nicely and rinses clean.  I&#x27;ve been using Sage Shampoo for about a month.  Last week I was away from home and had to use my regular shampoo and found my old favorite to be irritating.  Sage Shampoo manages and soothes the dry, flaky patches on my scalp.  I don&#x27;t plan to use any another shampoo!</li>
    <li> For some reason I&#x27;ve had a lot of hair loss with a lot of scalp issues this past summer and I tried many otc products from the drugstore with no luck. I was on Amazon just researching similar products and came across this and thought why not. So glad I purchased - this is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever tried for scalp issues. Give it a week, although I saw a difference after the first use. It&#x27;s really keeping my scalp in better condition, I started losing less hair. It smells great, doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair and does what it claims to do. I will purchase again and again - it is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Ok so i received this in a sample size and ive used it twice and its been about 2 weeks. normally by this time id know whether the item works for me or not. So im natural and ive suffered from scalp issues basically for about 6 years (im 16) and it has gotten alot better but not because of this shampoo.the shampoo lathered up VERY well even with little product which i love but what i didnt love was how it left my hair feeling, it felt mushy and SOFT but not a good soft. Now the biggest problem i have is my.own fault because this is a dandruff shampoo and im not sure whether i have dandruff or simply dry scalp. I read reviews which said it worked to sooth even just dry itchy scalp so i decided to try it nut i didnt work for me. The only thing id say it did do for me is kind of eliminate flacky scalp. Even after i itched i wouldnt see much flack which doesnt really WOW me because i want the itch GONE. thats all i want. This didnt do it for me. Even though it did not work for i do recommend it to people because everyones hair and scalp is different. I was really hoping this would of worked for me but nope.</li>
    <li> when the first time i used this shampoo, i&#x27;d been notice to my scalp and my hair will become a little change of being soft to touch and dandraft will not really  thick.</li>
    <li> Best natural shampoo I&#x27;ve tried!  Lathers great and smells wonderful...my hair is bouncy and energized even on the second day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d buy this again unless some other company really wowed me with something else. I had/have pretty bad dandruff and this shampoo really seemed to help replenish. I am thankful for the nice smell and most of all that this actually worked.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about two months and have really liked it. It is gentle and calms itchy scalp and reduces dandruff. It has a soft calming scent as well. My son has also started using it and he is happy as well.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo for almost two months. The bottle lasted approximately two months (washing my hair twice a week.) I did expect the bottle to be a little bit bigger than in the photo, however; I am glad that the bottle was smaller because I wanted to finish it soon. Even though it kept my hair free of dandruff and itching for days, it also dried out my hair a lot. My overall conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It said it has natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;-It keeps my scalp free of dandruff and itching for two days after I washed my hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It really dried out my curly hair!&lt;br /&gt;-If I stop using it, the dandruff and itching come back</li>
    <li> I have to tell you I was a bit skeptical but, I have itchy scalp and dandruff pretty bad. After using it one day now my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch and the dandruff is significantly less. I also feel better knowing the ingredients are100% natural. To boot it smells great!</li>
    <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis &amp; have had difficulty controlling it for years. I have tried shampoos with pyrithione zinc, coal tar and tea tree before so I was skeptical this would work. I usually need prescription medication. I&#x27;m only on my second shampoo and I already see an improvement. My scalp is much less itchy already &amp; there is no redness. I have color treated hair and my hair feels a little dry and rough in the shower after the shampoo, but I bought the Aragan conditioner and it smooths out the tangles quickly and easily. It has a nice lather and mild, pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t leave with out this shampoo, this is my second time purchasing and this the only shampoo that feels good on my scalp after washing my hair, it removes my iching almost instantly,  and it does not dry my hair eather .....  I will always be back for some more whenever I&#x27;ll need it...  Thanks for such a great shampoo.!!!  AAA++++</li>
    <li> I did not have much dandruff, I just decided to give this shampoo a try since it has such great reviews, and to get rid of my tiny problem completely. Unfortunately, it made my scalp even more itchy and dandruff increased after 4 times of use. Will continue using it as a body wash((</li>
    <li> My daughter saw a dermatologist for her dandruff and he put her on a topical medicine and three different shampoos but when she got a keratin treatment she couldn&#x27;t use them anymore and this shampoo worked great! The dandruff stayed at bay. I was so worried it would come back.</li>
    <li> I Ordered this shampoo as a last resort, after trying many different shampoo&#x27;s for my very dry, scaling, itchy scalp.  This shampoo worked for me &amp; I will keep on using it.  Awesome shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have a terrible dandruff scalp problem that I have had for most of my life. Name a shampoo, remedy, cure, oil, preparation, or prescription and I can almost guarantee that I have tried it. An acquaintance of mine recommended this shampoo, the Maple Holistic Sage for Heavy Dandruff, and gave me a travel bottle filled with some of hers. So, I tried it out, and I have to say that it is one of the best dandruff shampoos that I have tried. There is no nasty smell like some products, it is easy to get through my very thick hair, and after a month I have not built up an immunity to it. The smell is strong, though, very herbal, but it isn&#x27;t unpleasant. And... the most important part is that it works! I was really expecting another failure, and I was pleasantly surprised. While I don&#x27;t have a total absence of flake, I really don&#x27;t expect that of anything because even prescriptions have left me horribly flaky after a week. This product has significantly reduced the flake and itch. I am very pleased. I decided to purchase my own bottle. While the price was a little high, I was willing to invest in it. The cost is comparable to other high-end dandruff shampoos and prescriptions that don&#x27;t work nearly as well. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is suffering the scourge of the scalp and has unsuccessfully tried other concoctions. Five stars easy! I just really hope that I don&#x27;t end up building up an immunity to it, like I have with so many others. It&#x27;s lasted pretty long, though. I gave it a month, and I am still good.</li>
    <li> It cleans my hair great, and my dandruff is almost gone! I only need to wash it twice a week. I only wish they would make a bigger size</li>
    <li> So far I like this shampoo.  It doesn&#x27;t have sulfates which is a huge plus.  It smells great and feels great when you massage it into your scalp.  This shampoo also seems to minimize heavy dandruff issues that other &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; shampoos don&#x27;t seem to help.  The only downside with this shampoo is it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair the smoothest; it&#x27;s hard to brush through afterwards - but a good conditioner could solve this easily.</li>
    <li> Maple Holistics has created the best  dandruff shampoo I have ever used. It has been several weeks since buying this product, and It has made all the difference in the world as I am a 63 year old man that has tried many dandruff products. I would recommend this Sage shampoo by Maple Holistics to anyone who has dry, flaking scalp problems. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I had one issue with this shampoo:  I have an oily scalp and after washing with this shampoo my hair looks greasy after 24 hours.  I like to skip a day in between shampoos because I have long hair, and I cannot really do that with this product.  It is a shame because everything else about this product is wonderful- great smell, more-natural ingredients, and most importantly IT CLEARED UP ALL OF MY DANDRUFF.  I think this product would be perfect for people who have dandruff due to dry scalp, unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
    <li> Great product for those who want a natural shampoo that gets rid of dandruff. I&#x27;m definitely health conscious and so it&#x27;s important to me to take notice to not only what I put in my body, but what I put on it too. I love how it&#x27;s sulfate free and 100% natural and it STILL does what other brands do but without all the harsh chemicals. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter suffered from severe dandruff and we had tried many different shampoos. I bought this shampoo based on excellent user reviews. I noticed a huge difference almost immediately and I would say her dandruff is at least 75% better. This shampoo also leaves her hair soft and shiny. Great stuff and we will continue to use it indefinitely. Thank you for an effective shampoo that not only delivers on what it promises but is sulphate free as well.</li>
    <li> It took three washes for the shampoo to start making a difference, but it really works! My scalp is no longer itchy and though I cannot say that my hair is 100% dandruff free, it has significantly improved. The smell is really nice too.</li>
    <li> This product works great. My niece has very dry scalp that none of the store brands seemed to resolve. This product showed a great difference by the 2nd wash. Her dry flakes are literally gone. I used it myself as I have some dry scalp as well and mine was gone with the first wash. The smell is very nice, but a bit strong. I totally recommend it for people who have dry, itchy, flaky scalps. It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo and actually exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, thick, wavy, frizzy, slightly dry East Asian hair.  Not only do I have a lot of hair, but my individual hairs are thick and wiry.  (The stereotype of East Asian women with silky, soft straight hair is just that....a stereotype).  I also rarely dry my hair or use any hair products.....I just let it air dry then put my hair up in a ponytail (I&#x27;m a busy mom, who has time for all that primping?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this shampoo because I was noticing some minor dandruff.  I didn&#x27;t want to try a medicated shampoo because of all the chemicals.  Plus, my dandruff wasn&#x27;t severe, so I figured something natural would be a good place to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an expensive shampoo for the amount you get.  So, I used a small amount the first time I tried it. I was surprised at how well the shampoo lathered with such a small amount, even with my super thick hair.  I let the shampoo sit on my scalp for a few minutes as the directions say, and it was a nice gentle tingle.  The shampoo smells wonderful too, almost like aromatherapy.  Rinsing the shampoo out left my hair soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned, I don&#x27;t put any products in my hair, and I just let my hair air-dry.  After using this shampoo, my hair was surprisingly soft and smooth.....not in an oily or greasy way, but actually soft.  I usually use high end shampoo/conditioner products that cost more than $20 a bottle, and this shampoo worked as well as, or even better than my usual ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, sometimes when you switch to a new shampoo, your hair responds wonderfully at first.....then after a while, your hair goes back to its old ways.  It&#x27;s been one month since I started using this shampoo and I&#x27;m happy to report that this shampoo is still doing great things to my hair.  The dandruff has also disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should be noted that I had a very mild case of dandruff, so people with more dandruff might have different reactions.  I also use this shampoo with the Silk 18 Conditioner (also by Maple Holistics), so I&#x27;m not sure if the great results are just the shampoo, the conditioner, or a combination of both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.eactions.  I also use this shampoo with the Silk 18 Conditioner (also by Maple Holistics), so I&#x27;m not sure if the great results are just the shampoo, the conditioner, or a combination of both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Product simply does not deliver. The smell is a little much, but bearable if the product were to work to help eliminate dandruff. I used it for two weeks, made my scalp itch worse and then developed visible dandruff flakes. No thanks, save your money.</li>
    <li> Great product and wonderful</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this shampoo hoping to help with the many many scalp issues I have during the cold season.  First of all, the smell is so calming for me! It gives me that relaxation time in the shower to revamp and being a mom of three kiddos, that is a big deal. I also lose more than my fair share of hair,  so I hope to see a difference and will definitely update on that since hair regrowth naturally takes time. My only wish is that there was an option for a bigger bottle size than 8 oz. or 16 oz. so I could buy more in bulk.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo.  I&#x27;ve had issues on and off with dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis for years and have run through all of the over the counter dandruff shampoos at one time or another.  My experience with most of them is that they work for a while (if they work at all) and then over time cease to be effective.  I was hoping that a more natural option would yield a more lasting result as ideally it would just get my scalp back to a healthy place rather than medicating a problem.  So far, that&#x27;s exactly what&#x27;s happened with the Sage Shampoo.  Everything cleared up pretty quickly, and my scalp has been doing really well since.  I ordered the 16oz, which is actually just 2 of the 8oz bottles.  Each lasted about 5-6 weeks for me.  They lathered better than I expected for a sulfate-free product, which was a nice surprise.  Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase and hope that it continues to be effective.</li>
    <li> I must say this shampoo is the best I have ever tried in my life! My scalp and hair feel healthy and clean without&lt;br /&gt;feeling stripped. I am hooked. I ordered the small 8oz size to try it out and after one week of use I know I will be ordering again. I have only used the shampoo a handful of times but so far my hair and scalp feel wonderful. Finally a product that does what it claims!</li>
    <li> One of the best dandruff shampoo on the market. Very effective.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of my dandruff completely but has definitely definitely lessened it dramatically.</li>
    <li> Love it! It does smell like sage.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and totally does what it says. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be sulfate free but it&#x27;s not. It dried out my hair and made my dandruff worse.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband as he has used many products for dandruff that did not work. He also has itchy scalp. He used the Sage shampoo for the first time today and was so HAPPY that it relieved his itching!! Now he looks forward to no more dandruff!</li>
    <li> First was with this shampoo was better than expected! No burning, no itching, and no flaking! It&#x27;s bee three days and still no flaking!</li>
    <li> I was looking for the most effective anti-dandruff shampoo out there.  I didn&#x27;t care what its bottle looked like or how it smelled, only that it worked.  Of all the AD shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, this was the most effective.  With regular use, this product reduces dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo has a very strong scent (of sage), but it doesn&#x27;t linger, so if you don&#x27;t like it, don&#x27;t worry too much about it -- it will soon dissipate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ranger out.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product, but it doesn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now and I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in my dandruff or scalp itchiness. I&#x27;ve followed the instructions that come with it exactly (even blasting cold water at the end of my shower, which is unpleasant), but to no avail. 3 stars because it&#x27;s natural and didn&#x27;t make things worse. I&#x27;ll have to continue my search. :(</li>
    <li> My scalp used to burn real bad and my hair fell out in handfuls. This happened for several months and my doctor could not figure out why. I tried changing shampoos numerous times, only picking all natural brands. This is the only brand that works amazingly. I can&#x27;t believe that my hair started to grow back and my scalp healed. This is the ONLY shampoo I will ever use now. Also, it&#x27;s nice that you don&#x27;t need to use too much, so it lasts a good while. I have long (mid back) hair that is wavy.</li>
    <li> This is the WORST shampoo I have ever used!  It may work if you have natural hair, but if you have highlighted hair or blonde hair it will make your hair look like STRAW!!!!....I was shocked after shampooing with this....It might get rid of &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34;, but do you want a head of &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34;???...........I can&#x27;t believe all the positive reviews!  To make matters worse, the Seller never even contacted me about the e-mail I sent to them complaining about the product!.....That does NOT sit well with me!!!  I wasn&#x27;t going to post this bad review till I heard back from them, but evidently they don&#x27;t care!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome Shampoo for dandruff treatment. Within few washes i could see the difference in the scalp. The smell is really strong like eucalyptus .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had dandruff since high-school - at 26, the problem haunts me yet. In a new spirit of homeopathy, I ordered &#x27;natural&#x27; or &#x27;organic&#x27; toothpaste, shampoo, and conditioner. Sage came up as the shampoo and it&#x27;s fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to be afraid to scrub shampoo deeply into my scalp for fear I&#x27;d create more dandruff - but not with this. I&#x27;m not sure if it moisturizes, cleans, kills fungus, or heals my scalp, but it works. After a couple days, if I haven&#x27;t shampoo&#x27;ed with this stuff, I&#x27;ll start getting flakey again, but then after a couple days of use, I&#x27;m clean again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main thing here (hence the title) is that this is better than Head and Shoulders! I live with roommates and that&#x27;s what they all use, so I sit in the shower shampooing up with Sage, staring at the bottles of Head and Shoulders thinking &#x27;the fools&#x27; and &#x27;I remember when I used to be stuck there...&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great to have a safe, natural product that works - I fully support this.</li>
    <li> Just a wonderful product! I wish I had tried it before spending too much money. A difference in my frizzy hair is felt the very first time. It feels clean(no more dandruff), soft and shiny. Thank you for this amazing product.</li>
    <li> It surely helped reducing dandruff.  I tried other natural shampoos, soaps, etc. for many years, but they always left my hair oily and a lot of dandruff and my hair didn&#x27;t get dry easily.  This product worked dramatically and I saw the difference at the first usage.  I also enjoyed the luxurious aroma!</li>
    <li> My daughter in law brought this to me to try. In the colder months I suffer from terrible dry itchy scalp and dandruff. Nothing seems to help....well until I tried the Sage Shampoo. This is definitely going to be my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; shampoo from now on. Love the way it made my hair feel!</li>
    <li> Only been using this product for a couple of weeks. I really enjoy it. It does seem to he working. I have noticed a decrease in dandruff as well as my scalp is no longer as itchy.  Not sure how it will continue to work as the seasons change but definitely going to keep using it! Giving it 4 stars for all the changes I have seen so far!!!</li>
    <li> I have had such a dry scalp for just about a year now, and my head has been incredibly itchy.  After trying this product, I feel a calming effect on my scalp.  I feel like I&#x27;ve been to a spa!!  This product is amazing, no more dandruff, less itching, and my hair is growing in much healthier!  Love this product!</li>
    <li> I received this shampoo from my mother for my 14 year old son who has dandruff and it was pretty severe. We have been using it for around three months now(he washes his hair every other night) and I haven&#x27;t noticed any dandruff since we started using it months ago. He switches up his shampoos so I wouldn&#x27;t even say that he uses this shampoo every wash. Pretty impressive that this is a natural product and has cleared/treated such a severe case. And it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Sage Shampoo and believe it&#x27;s a great product! It didn&#x27;t help me get rid off all the dandruff, but it does have its perks! You don&#x27;t need a big amount to work it into a rich lather, so the product lasts a very long time. Also, I really love the smell and my hair feel silky afterwords. Good product!</li>
    <li> This sage shampoo works well to reduce dandruff and smells great! I switch from my old product and now only use this.</li>
    <li> I liked this product, it helps in keeping hair soft and manageable. I liked smell as well. It really helped with dandruff as well. I have been using it for almost 3 weeks and I see lot of improvement with my hairs. I am giving it 4 stars as I have used it for almost 3 weeks. But I will continue using it further to see the results on my hairs.</li>
    <li> The Shampoo really suits me....I have dandruff problem and the shampoos available in the market does not suits me. But this one is perfect solution for me....</li>
    <li> I love it! first of all, it doesn&#x27;t contain any chemicals - which is great!&lt;br /&gt;I love the Rosmarin smell - it gives it a clean smell aroma. Although there no chemicals - it is still foaming - which with my curly, thick, full hair - it is very important.&lt;br /&gt;Then - the head and the hair are really clean - and it last - even though I&#x27;m using a lot of products on my hair. I&#x27;m gonna buy it again for sure!</li>
    <li> I have seborrheac psoriasis rather than garden variety dandruff.  It means my scalp gets inflamed by many products and starts to produce a lot of crusted patches that inhibit hair growth and vitality. It also creates intense itching even immediately after shampooing. My best solution used to be dousing my scalp in salicylic acid a couple of times a week, or at flair up spots, but it was a temporary spot treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried every shampoo under the sun to try and resolve it.  Most of them expensive specialties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is kind of incredible.  I added a plastic scalp massager when i bought the shampoo and when I use the two together my scalp is completely free of scale and inflammation.  My hair is is fuller even days after shampooing and it doesn&#x27;t seem to stip out my hair coloring.  The old red, scaly patches that used to appear around my hair line are calm and not scaling over, and the real test - hair brushing over a black top - not a spot of white!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used the product twice.  I do not follow with a conditioner in the shower as it is generally a big irritant. I use a spray on. I will continue to use this product and hope that it is my permanent cure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This product seems to be the only thing among many I have tried that is actually working to treat my dandruff. Dandruff can be caused by winter dryness, but also apparently by a fungus or skin infection that makes it really hard to get rid of. I have been using this product for over a month and notice a great difference. I noticed an immediate difference within first 2 uses.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo for my fiancee because he has been having really dry scalp lately.. he has been using it for going on 2 weeks and it seems to be help in his scalp.! Im glad we found something that works at a reasonable price.! :-) and i love that its not full of chemicals as well.!</li>
    <li> This product work. My scalp has been looking like I pour floor on it for the past year. I wash my hair weekly so I have used it only 4 times and my scarp is clean and most importantly it stayed clean all week.  Remember the problem is your scalp so don&#x27;t lather your hair than say it does not work. I put the shampoo on my scarp and waited 10 minute before washing it, in about 7 minute I could feel my scarp tingling. the result is a clean scalp.</li>
    <li> This shampoo made my scalp even more scaly and dry than is normal.  I had such high hopes based on all the positive reviews, but it was no kind to me.  A waste of money unfortunately.</li>
    <li> have been using for 4 weeks. no improvements.</li>
    <li> This is a fantasti shampoo for clearly up skin problems everywhere.</li>
    <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little shampoo goes a long way and works into a rich lather.  The product manages dandruff and does not dull the color.  I use it every four to five hair washes, and this product works for me.  I whole-heartedly recommend this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, Maple Holistics is a great company with really good customer service.</li>
    <li> I have a scalp problem and have used many different shampoos that only dried  my hair of all oils but all the chemicals made it difficult to manage after using the sage shampoo I see a marked different live this product</li>
    <li> This product does a decent job. Since I have started using it, my dandruff has reduced significantly. But I have a few concerns:&lt;br /&gt;- This product worked very well at first. Upon using it, I realized that the effectiveness seems to be decreasing a bit.&lt;br /&gt;- My hair is becoming a bit rough since I have started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who is struggling with heavy dandruff issues.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sage shampoo for the past two weeks to treat a severe dandruff problem that prescription Nizoral shampoo was not controlling well. Since I start using Sage, although my dandruff is not completely gone, it has reduced the condition dramatically. I like the smell of Sage and will keep using it.</li>
    <li> After reading many of the reviews posted, I decided to give this shampoo a try.  In the past, I&#x27;ve tried Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree, Redken&#x27;s Solve, Head and Shoulders, Selsun Gold for Women, and Neutrogena&#x27;s T-Gel.  None of these shampoos alleviated my dandruff problem.  I received this shampoo a week or so ago and it has worked wonderfully.  My scalp and hair are both clean and feel really healthy. Flakes are pretty much non-existent.  I have to admit, the fragrance isn&#x27;t that great, but it&#x27;s not horrible either.  The shampoo leaves my hair feeling silky soft and very shiny.  It lathers really well and isn&#x27;t runny...so it doesn&#x27;t run down in your eyes while you let it cleanse for 3-4 minutes.  So far, I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo for 3 weeks and didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
    <li> I love it! This is an amazing holistic product, that smells amazing. I never need conditioner now it leaves my hair soft. I love that it is chemical free and lathers up better than any other holistic shampoo I have ever tried. It is strong with sage, but it seems to keep my scalp and hair healthy. I would recommend it for anyone with psoriasis as well.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo! I support companies who do not practice animal testing and provide their products with sustainability.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo for my kids&#x27; hair for their dandruff.  They swim in a highly chlorinated pool and get dry scalps.  We&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks and the dandruff has cleared up and the kids all love the smell.</li>
    <li> My dandruff got worse after using the shampoo. Just when i started seeing progress with this shampoo, the problem got worse all of a sudden.</li>
    <li> I recently received my free sample from Maple Holistics (yes, they send you a free sample if you e-mail them). My initial thought was that I&#x27;d wait a week or so before writing a review; however, I had immediate results. I was reluctant to even get this shampoo because of the price, but I had nothing to lose since they sent me a free sample so I gave it a shot. I am going to order it immediately. The smell is super nice too so that&#x27;s a huge plus! This is going to be my everyday shampoo now, I am absolutely sold on it :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. Perhaps should be used more often, but too expensive.</li>
    <li> Out of all the similar products I have tried, this is the only one that really gave me results. It lessened my dandruff within just a few weeks and it stays that way even on days that I do not wash my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair felt so clean and fresh after using this shampoo. My scalp was calm and not irritated.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product.</li>
    <li> Great product, love that is made of natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> Overall, this was a nice alternative shampoo designed to help with dry, flaky scalp. I used it once a week, alternating with my regular shampoo. It has a pleasant smell. It has a gel like consistency, and I did not need as much in terms of quantity to obtain a very nice, thick lather. I have curl, thin hair, so I felt like the shampoo stripped my hair more than my usual shampoo, leaving it slightly more dry than my regular shampoo. Most shampoos do, so I am very selective. Having said that, it was neglible, but worth sharing. I did not notice any change to my dry, flaky scalp beyond the day that I used the shampoo, but perhaps that it because I did not use the product frequently. I also have the same finding with my go-to dandruff shampoo - no noticeable results beyond day of washing. I also did not rinse and repeat as instructed. In summary, overall this is a nice product, and I greatly appreciate the company providing a free sample to test.</li>
    <li> I am 100% ++++++ more than satisfied this shampoo!! My daughter (11 years old) has been suffering from a severe type of dandruff - I don&#x27;t even know at her severity - if it would be considered dandruff. I tried everything - short of taking her to the dermatologist (which I was about to do). I&#x27;ve spent countless money on &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; shampoos and even taken her to the salon every other week for &amp;#34;scalp treatments&amp;#34; - but her dandruff was so bad - that literally in 24 hours - the dandruff would flake back up and be caked in her scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We begun using this shampoo last weekend and after only one use - no dandruff!!!! I was waiting for it to reappear the next day - but it did not! Then we waited through out the week - but still no dandruff!!! This product really works!!  We feel we have found the cure and treatment for her scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thinking it might take a few washes or several before we saw much progressed - but this product worked like a charm!!! Can&#x27;t say enough great things and how happy we are!!  If this product worked for my child (worse possible case of dandruff) - I know it&#x27;ll work for anybody!!! Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I always have trouble with my scalp in the winter months.  It tends to get super dry, itchy and flakey.  I was skeptical about paying this amount for a shampoo, but decided to give it a try.  During the first week of use, I noticed that after each wash I was combing out massive flakes.  Within the second week of using this shampoo, the flakes were completely gone, and my scalp feels great.  No more sensitivity, itching or dryness.  I&#x27;m hooked!  The added bonus is that this shampoo smells AMAZING.  I&#x27;ve received lots of compliments on my good smelling hair!  If you are on the fence about this product, give it a try.  There is a satisfaction guaranee, and you have absolutely nothing to lose!!</li>
    <li> I have used many different dandruff shampoos from various retailers.  I finally tried something a little more expensive and more organic.  My results have been fantastic so far (it&#x27;s been about a month).  I could tell a difference from the first time I used the shampoo - flakes decreased and are all but gone now, red marks around hairline are gone (sometimes it flares up, but after one wash they are gone again), and the smell is great in comparison to a tar or other dandruff shampoos.  I would definitely recommend and might even buy more from Sage.  I&#x27;m a fair skinned, red headed male, so believe this review as true!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is pretty expensive, but it has cut down my dandruff by about 95%, I&#x27;d say.  The smell is nice and it lathers very well even with a very small amount  There are actually an awful lot of ingredients in it, but at least only 1 had a pretty high rating on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s site.  Any that I couldn&#x27;t find there, I tried to find a link somewhere else describing the ingredient.  Here&#x27;s what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- SODIUM COCOYL ISETHIONATE &#x3D; 1&lt;br /&gt;- COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE &#x3D; 4&lt;br /&gt;- SODIUM LAUROAMPHOACETATE &#x3D; 0&lt;br /&gt;- SODIUM METHYL COCOYL TAURATE &#x3D; 0&lt;br /&gt;- SODIUM LAURYL GLUCOSE CARBOXYLATE &#x3D; (http://www.naturopathica.com/ingredients/ingredient_glossary?q&#x3D;s)&lt;br /&gt;- LAURYL GLUCOSIDE &#x3D; 1&lt;br /&gt;- SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE &#x3D; 1&lt;br /&gt;- ACRYLATES COPOLYMER &#x3D; 2&lt;br /&gt;- COCO-GLUCOSIDE &#x3D; 1&lt;br /&gt;- GLYCERYL OLEATE &#x3D; 1&lt;br /&gt;- CAPRYLHYDROXAMIC ACID &#x3D; (https://www.truthinaging.com/ingredients/caprylhydroxamic-acid)&lt;br /&gt;- GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE &#x3D; 0&lt;br /&gt;- GLYCERIN &#x3D; 2&lt;br /&gt;- SODIUM PCA &#x3D; 1&lt;br /&gt;- D-PANTHENOL &#x3D; 1&lt;br /&gt;- SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS (JOJOBA) OIL &#x3D; 0&lt;br /&gt;- BOTANICAL KERATIN &#x3D; ?&lt;br /&gt;- SALVIA OFFICINALIS (SAGE) OIL &#x3D; 0&lt;br /&gt;- PRUNUS PERSICA (PEACH KERNEL) OIL &#x3D; 0&lt;br /&gt;- NARDOSTACHYS JATAMANSI (SPIKENARD) OIL &#x3D; 0&lt;br /&gt;- MELALEUCA ALTERNIFOLIA (TEA TREE) OIL &#x3D; 0&lt;br /&gt;- ROSEMARINUS OFFICINALIS (ROSEMARY) OIL &#x3D; 0</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo for my 11 year old daughter who has oily hair, dandruff, itchy scalp and gets hairline acne. Her skin can be sensitive and so I wanted to try a natural shampoo to help her with her issues. She has used it for two weeks and is really liking it. The shampoo cleans her hair nicely, she says that the itching has stopped, I have noticed less dandruff and she hasn&#x27;t had a new acne breakout at her hairline since she started using the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about a month now and it works! My scalp is no longer itchy. It works better than Selsun Blue or Head and Shoulders for dandruff.</li>
