      <li>It makes my skin more smooth</li>
      <li>good product, really softens wrinkles</li>
      <li>This is the first review I have ever posted on ANY product of any kind.  </li>
      <li>-- am now over four months into this -- and see not ONE BIT of difference in my fine lines or the texture of my skin.  </li>
      <li>No heavy feeling and have noticed a good improvement.</li>
      <li>This stuff really really works!!!</li>
      <li>really makes your skin look better.  </li>
      <li>But it did feel good on my skin if that makes you feel any different?</li>
      <li>marks.&lt;br /&gt;The seller fulfilled the order quickly as well.  </li>
      <li>and I see change on nasolabial lines, and upper my cheeks when I smile more, also better around my face.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>recommend this product to anyone-it is worth the money, and you won&#x27;t be sorry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>By far it was my forehead lines that have benefited the most from this serum-most of them are</li>
      <li>I saw the difference right away.</li>
      <li>Both were recommended by their customer service rep as suitable products to apply after applying the Un Wrinkle Turbo fluid.  </li>
      <li>When I first tried this product-I was not at all happy with it, which was odd because I have LOVED nearly every other PTR product I have used.</li>
      <li>it has helped reduce the fine lip lines as well as the frown lines near the bridge of my nose.</li>
      <li>I will have a better idea of the effectiveness of this product once I use the entire bottle.</li>
      <li>and my face does feel soft and smooth after using it.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>My skin looked very hydrated!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s expensive but wonderful.  </li>
      <li>This is also one of the only serums I have been able to use in my eye area (a very sensitive area for me), without my eyes watering or turning too red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have and &amp;#34;deep wrinkles&amp;#34; but I do have a number of lines that are beginning to form.</li>
      <li>This is such a wonderful product; my deep wrinkles are much less visible.  </li>
      <li>but i didnt have much luck.</li>
      <li>I love this product but it arrived empty to my house .</li>
      <li>I have been using this for a while now and really like it.</li>
      <li>I have combination skin, but now that I am getting older, I started having more dry patches and began to get adult acne.  </li>
      <li>True to my earlier impressions, it does seem to improve the appearance of my skin.</li>
      <li>Of the many face  serums I&#x27;ve used over the years, this is the only one I can say has made a noticeable difference in my deep lines and wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>I think it helps, but if you are older like me</li>
      <li>Been using the big brands and this one is above them for sure.</li>
      <li>This turbo serum has a very high concentration of pentapeptides which are known to boost natural collagen in aging skin.</li>
      <li>I put a tiny bit on over my make up every day and it makes my skin look dewy and fresh.</li>
      <li>Those are tough ones and I am happy enough with that result.  </li>
      <li>wrinkles are a way of life if you live it.</li>
      <li>I see clear results.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m on accutane but so far</li>
      <li>I followed the instructions to the T -- and applied twice per day -- never missing even one day  </li>
      <li>because I&#x27;m 52 years old.</li>
      <li>I will probably switch to the day cream during the hot summer months, since my skin isn&#x27;t as dry then.  </li>
      <li>But because I spent so much money on it, I decided to keep using it, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier I did.</li>
      <li>I am 63 and my &amp;#34;11&#x27;s&amp;#34; and forehead lines are barely noticeable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product roughly 1-1/2 to 2 months, and I don&#x27;t feel I can give an accurate review, because I feel that it will take a little longer to see results if there are going to be any.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very skeptical and hard to impress, PTR products have definitely impressed me.  </li>

<li> After 2 months, some of my smaller wrinkles are less noticeable, and I am no longer getting adult acne.  </li>
<li> and it does the 1fl oz does last a long time.</li>
<li> It has helped clear up redness-including a few acne scars, and it has helped clear up active acne.</li>
<li> I am currently on accutane treatment and my skin has been incredibly dry.</li>
<li> a bottle lasts longer than half a year to near a year if you use it twice a day</li>
<li> It&#x27;s worth the small investment since a little goes a long way</li>

<li> and even Lamer would not work even though I&#x27;ve been using it long before the accutane treatment.</li>
<li> acne prone, very oily, semi-pigmented, pale, few lines</li>
<li> I use Studio Gear Mineral loose powder (dry) foundation</li>
<li> so I expected to see results.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure I will continue using it after my accutane treatment, but definitely, I will be using it to address the very dry skin I&#x27;ve been suffering from throughout the accutane treatment.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s just not worth the money</li>
<li> But not worth the money?</li>
<li> And I think because it is hydrated, it will eventually cause some wrinkles to appear softer and less</li>
<li> Normally, Peter Thomas Roth products work well, but this was an expensive purchase for a product that did not deliver what it was intended to do.</li>
<li> no significant results like PTR claims.</li>
<li> fingers felt a little sticky (just a little) during application</li>
<li> all i can say is i saw a little improvement in texture of my skin.</li>
<li> this is expensive, so I am giving it 4 stars, but combined with the Unwrinkle NIGHT cream, my skin has never felt so soft.  </li>
<li> I do not care for the Unwrinkle pads, as they seem to strip my skin of the natural oils, and leave a film that I find uncomfortable,</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Of the many face  serums I&#x27;ve used over the years, this is the only one I can say has made a noticeable difference in my deep lines and wrinkles.  It&#x27;s not a facelift in a bottle so don&#x27;t expect miracles but it does help.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love it and Way Cheaper !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get any results.</li>
    <li> I love all PTR products.  This is no exception!  I&#x27;m very skeptical and hard to impress, PTR products have definitely impressed me.  I can actually see the results!</li>
    <li> this is expensive, so I am giving it 4 stars, but combined with the Unwrinkle NIGHT cream, my skin has never felt so soft.  After 2 months, some of my smaller wrinkles are less noticeable, and I am no longer getting adult acne.  I do not care for the Unwrinkle pads, as they seem to strip my skin of the natural oils, and leave a film that I find uncomfortable, but without using them, I am getting great results.  I have combination skin, but now that I am getting older, I started having more dry patches and began to get adult acne.  My dermatologist said I actually needed a heavier facial cream.  I mentioned the serum and the night cream.  She told me to use the night cream instead of the day one and it is not too heavy for my skin at all during the day.  I use Studio Gear Mineral loose powder (dry) foundation and it is a perfect combo for light coverage, and a dewy, more youthful appearance with nice staying power.  I can honestly say this is the healthiest my skin has ever been.  I will probably switch to the day cream during the hot summer months, since my skin isn&#x27;t as dry then.  Finally, I use this on my face, neck, and chest.  All three areas have improved.</li>
    <li> Inmediatilly,I am used for 21 days only this serum no more creams and I see change on nasolabial lines, and upper my cheeks when I smile more, also better around my face.</li>
    <li> This turbo serum has a very high concentration of pentapeptides which are known to boost natural collagen in aging skin. I have seen a reversal of wrinkles on my forehead, eyes and nasolabial folds resulting in people telling my that I look like a teenager. I have to say, it feels really good to hear that because I&#x27;m 52 years old. There are many pentapeptide products on the market but this one is one of the best for under $100 and the 1 oz. container lasts 30 days if you use 2 pumps per day.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since it was introduced and never want to be without it. Since its purpose is to reduce deep wrinkles, it takes a while for you to begin to see a difference. For me it was about 2 months - totally acceptable to me since it took years for those wrinkles to get there.  After the second bottle, the difference was quite noticeable. I am 63 and my &amp;#34;11&#x27;s&amp;#34; and forehead lines are barely noticeable. I have the marionette lines of some 30 year olds and the nose to lip lines a somewhat improved.  Those are tough ones and I am happy enough with that result.  At least they have not gotten worse. Even though the product is not meant for the neck I use it there anyway. It got rid of one of my tree lines and it has kept the other one from getting worse. I hope I can always afford to purchase this product!</li>
    <li> I received a sample for this and with just one use, I felt a difference! My face was softer and felt smoother... the lines were still there but I didn&#x27;t expect it to work overnight. I&#x27;m just quite happy that my face looked healthier. I am currently on accutane treatment and my skin has been incredibly dry. It looked and felt ashy. I&#x27;ve been using Lamer (talk about expensive!) and even Lamer would not work even though I&#x27;ve been using it long before the accutane treatment. One night on PTR Turbo Unwrinkle and voila! My skin looked very hydrated! And I think because it is hydrated, it will eventually cause some wrinkles to appear softer and less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fingers felt a little sticky (just a little) during application but my face didn&#x27;t feel sticky at all. I was waiting for a breakout that some users reported. Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m on accutane but so far, no breakout. I&#x27;m not sure I will continue using it after my accutane treatment, but definitely, I will be using it to address the very dry skin I&#x27;ve been suffering from throughout the accutane treatment. At Amazon&#x27;s discounted price, I think it&#x27;s at least worth a try.</li>
    <li> Peter Thomas Roth is Fantastic! I have used it for about two years, and the minute you put it on your face you can see the difference! It is a part of my daily routine. I never travel without it!</li>
    <li> I had used a &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; of this product and saw a difference, a lessening, of lines and wrinkles. I wanted to purchase a bottle but it was too expensive for me. Amazon to the rescue! A seller had an excellent price so I made the purchase. True to my earlier impressions, it does seem to improve the appearance of my skin. I will have a better idea of the effectiveness of this product once I use the entire bottle. I am glad Amazon had the item at a price that made it worth my while to give this product a good try.</li>
    <li> Awesome product--it is wonderful! it has helped reduce the fine lip lines as well as the frown lines near the bridge of my nose.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after one of the Sephora ladies recommended it. It makes my skin more smooth and I think youngr looking.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I think it helps, but if you are older like me wrinkles are a way of life if you live it. I bought this as new,&lt;br /&gt;but I am sure it had been opened, because it comes with a safe protection wrap and this one did not. I will see how long it&lt;br /&gt;lasts. I saved $70 from QVC. I wished it came in 2 oz. I use it with almond oil.</li>
    <li> I love this product but it arrived empty to my house .</li>
    <li> love it. have been using it for a couple of years. a bottle lasts longer than half a year to near a year if you use it twice a day</li>
    <li> This is truly one of the best products I have ever used.  I see clear results.  Makes the skin glow</li>
    <li> I love this product. However the last time I ordered it the dispenser did not work&lt;br /&gt;and I never got a response from the seller. Amazon did not charge my account.&lt;br /&gt;I returned the product but was dissapointed that I didn&#x27;t hear a peep from the seller.&lt;br /&gt;I felt that the pump was defective or a used product.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions to the T -- and applied twice per day -- never missing even one day  -- am now over four months into this -- and see not ONE BIT of difference in my fine lines or the texture of my skin.  Truly --- not one bit of improvement -- and I am ever the optimist -- so I expected to see results.  FAIL. This is the first review I have ever posted on ANY product of any kind.  But felt I needed to \\&quot;warn\\&quot; potential customers about this one.</li>
    <li> honestly for the price it was in ulta 150 i was like must be a excellent wrinkle reducer. no its not that great and i got it on amazon for a steal so i was thinking it would work wonders but i didnt have much luck. all i can say is i saw a little improvement in texture of my skin.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 2 months, only placing the serum on my forehead where I have two creases. After using as directed, there was no improvement in the texture or deepness of these lines. Normally, Peter Thomas Roth products work well, but this was an expensive purchase for a product that did not deliver what it was intended to do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on this product for over two months now, using it twice a day and applying Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s Max All Day Moisture Defense Cream in the morning and another one of their  products, the Ultra-Lite Anit-Aging Cellular Repair in the evening.  Both were recommended by their customer service rep as suitable products to apply after applying the Un Wrinkle Turbo fluid.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a bit of difference in my skin.  I&#x27;ve been using their products for at least 15 years and this is the first time I&#x27;ve been disappointed in one of their products.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying it even a the discounted price on Amazon.  The regular retail price is $150 and it&#x27;s just not worth the money anyway you look at it.</li>
    <li> good product, really softens wrinkles</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a month and have not seen any decrease on my wrinkles. This product does not gives the benefits that it claims.</li>
    <li> When I first tried this product-I was not at all happy with it, which was odd because I have LOVED nearly every other PTR product I have used. But because I spent so much money on it, I decided to keep using it, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier I did. However, the results are not immediate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the most soothing but potent serums I have EVER used. It has helped soothe my skin after a peel, after a bad acne break out, and after some sun burns. It has helped clear up redness-including a few acne scars, and it has helped clear up active acne. This is also one of the only serums I have been able to use in my eye area (a very sensitive area for me), without my eyes watering or turning too red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have and &amp;#34;deep wrinkles&amp;#34; but I do have a number of lines that are beginning to form. While the fine lines around my eyes are still there, the frown lines that were beginning to form do look slightly better. By far it was my forehead lines that have benefited the most from this serum-most of them are non-existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone-it is worth the money, and you won&#x27;t be sorry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin type: 20-something, acne prone, very oily, semi-pigmented, pale, few lines</li>
    <li> This is a good product to use if you have fine lines and some deeper lines but don&#x27;t expect magic. It won&#x27;t erase all your wrinkles but it does lessen them if you maintain a daily use. Cannot beat the price especially on Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s website it&#x27;s $150.00 &amp; at a local beauty store nearby the same price.  It&#x27;s worth the small investment since a little goes a long way and it does the 1fl oz does last a long time. You don&#x27;t need a lot, just a drop for the areas you want to apply.</li>
    <li> Have been using this serum for a year and I absolutely love it! Been using the big brands and this one is above them for sure. Giives my skin a great moist and firmess . I saw the difference right away.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! I put a tiny bit on over my make up every day and it makes my skin look dewy and fresh. My friends told me I looked like I&#x27;d had something done! It makes me look like a fresher, more &amp;#34;youthful&amp;#34;  me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product roughly 1-1/2 to 2 months, and I don&#x27;t feel I can give an accurate review, because I feel that it will take a little longer to see results if there are going to be any.&lt;br /&gt;Right now, I don&#x27;t see any difference in on my face. I can say it goes on very nicely and my face does feel soft and smooth after using it.&lt;br /&gt;But no significant results like PTR claims.</li>
    <li> All I can say is it works great for me. No heavy feeling and have noticed a good improvement. My go to product</li>
    <li> I felt that this product did not do anything for me? Maybe it kept me from any additional wrinkles? But I DID NOT NOTICE ANY DIFFERENCE in my skin texture or lines? But it did feel good on my skin if that makes you feel any different? But not worth the money?</li>
    <li> This is such a wonderful product; my deep wrinkles are much less visible.  It&#x27;s fabulous!  It&#x27;s expensive but wonderful.  No more words!</li>
    <li> This product is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for me. I apply it before I put on my foundation and it minimizes any semblance of wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Hooray! Keep it coming!</li>
    <li> really makes your skin look better.  love it.  works great for fine lines and wrinkles.  this is the second time I bought it. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a while now and really like it. I think it softens the lines on the face and keeps your skin in good shape.</li>
    <li> I use this daily on my face.  It&#x27;s great as under make-up, and my skin feels hydrated and healthy.  Haven&#x27;t had any breakouts while using and my face feels great all day - and it&#x27;s even helped with my post-pregnancy stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;The seller fulfilled the order quickly as well.  I will order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> This stuff really really works!!!</li>
