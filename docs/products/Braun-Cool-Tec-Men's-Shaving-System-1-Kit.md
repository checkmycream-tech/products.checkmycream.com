      <li>However, with the fact that Braun has changed its &#x27;construction&#x27; of the replacement foil and cutter for the 8595, rendering it an inferior product to its original state, it looks like the CoolTec will be the choice for the closet shave I have experienced in any razor since the 8595.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a razor but it worked well.</li>
    <li> I have been a long-time user of Braun (ever since the first clean-and-charge razor debuted). This shave is excellent! The shaver head does not pivot as the Series 7 does (which I just replaced with the Cool-Tec). However, the shave is still the standard, thorough, close, Braun shave. Yet, what sets this apart is the brilliance of the cooling unit. The electric ceramic bar really is superb! It&#x27;s as though you are rubbing an ice cube (without the water) against your skin as you shave. It&#x27;s brilliant. A really brilliant design and concept. Well done.</li>
    <li> never had as close shave as this unit  AWESOME &amp; COOL SHAVE. Cool tec sure is awesome. Everyone needs this&lt;br /&gt;unit.</li>
    <li> had it for a week and lovin it  close comfortable cooooool  shave</li>
    <li> I bought this razor about 18 months ago to replace a Braun Series 7 which had served me well but had outlived its life expectancy. From day 1, this shaver did not shave as closely or as smoothly as the Series 7. The shaver never gets longer hairs on the neck. I have to use the trimmer and that irritates my skin.The cooling system works, but I never really felt that my prior shaver had a problem with regard to heat. I have recently been advised that this shaver is a Series 3 (bottom of the line) with the cooling added. You can buy a Series 7 for the price of the CoolTec and will get much better service and shaves.  I would not recommend this shaver to a friend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Braun electric shavers for several generations of their products. Having very sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve experimented with every type of blade, cream, oil and machine possible. I finally found the right combination of double edge safety razor blade, handle and cream that leaves me unscathed in getting a perfect shave, but since I travel for a living and razor blades are frowned on by the TSA and scary men with uniforms and hand cuffs, my preferred solution was an effective electric shaver, especially while traveling. Braun has been the most effective alternative for me with the last previous incarnation being their Series 7, 790 shaver, which I&#x27;ve used with complete satisfaction. Admittedly, though, it&#x27;s effectiveness came at a cost of being just slightly aggressive, and if I pressed to hard against my skin in a hurry to get out the door, I managed to inflict some irritation. This new series of shavers from Braun , boasting a cooling bar, in all honesty had the ring of a gimmick after perhaps having nowhere to go to improve an already near perfect product as their 790. I&#x27;m very happy to admit that I was cynically mistaken. this shaver, while not perfect, is welcome and appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first reaction when examining it was frankly, disappointment. It looked and felt like a cost cutting compromise. Unlike the 790, the shaving head is fixed and doesn&#x27;t pivot. It shed the beautiful glass indicator at the bottom that graphically showed both the degree of charge and the degree of hygiene, i.e. when it was time to thoroughly clean the head. The 790 had a clever arrangement where the sideburn trimmer rose vertically out in a 90 degree snap that made it very accessible, whereas this new model has an arrangement where the trimmer lamely slides up with less drama and range. I was ready to pronounce it a disappointing cost reduction design at a premium price. Until I fired it up and tried it. It has a solid, monolithic feel, and requires more conscious maneauvering due to the lack of the pivoting head I was accustomed to. But that translated into feeling less gimmicky and more solid. The shave and cutting action does seem less aggressive than my old Braun which also seemed disappointing, until I realized that it was in reality more gentile to my skin. But the whole point to this new incarnation is The Cool factor. There&#x27;s an aluminum bar positioned between the two cutting foils that presses against the skin and it is indeed cool. I cynically muttered that, while it had a refreshing sensation, that it wasn&#x27;t making any difference to the skin. Again, I gratefully had to assess that I was wrong. Evidently, that quick touch of coolness is enough to calm any abrasiveness the blades and cutting foil might cause. I think I did have to revisit a spot or two because of the more mild aggressiveness, but ultimately the shave was complete and effective with no irritation whatsoever. Even the shape of the shaver which is mildly more of a broader \\&quot;Y\\&quot; and is bulkier at the top than the the older model is more ergonomic and so more natural to hold. I should note that according to the manual, using the Cooling feature does diminish the battery charge more quickly, whatever technology that cooling involves, so you can press the blue button on the front to disaffect the cooling. But since the shaver is recharged as soon as you place it back in the stand and since the cooling factor is really the whole point of this thing, I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;d want to turn that off. In some ways, the look and design does appear to be pared back and no doubt is cost cutting on the manufacturing, the reality is that it seems to be achieving a superior end result. Which is the whole reason you choose an electric razor and this particular Cooling design to begin with. If you, like me, are migrating from the Braun 7 series, it will take a small adjustment. But especially if you have sensitive skin prone to irritation, you should find this model a welcomeand effective product. It might be mentioned that it&#x27;s made in Germany, which gives me more confidence in it&#x27;s integrity than if it had been stamped out in China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This package  includes the clean and charge station.  At one time I felt this was excessive and just a ploy to sell an additional accessory both initially, but more importantly, the constant need to purchase the fluid reservoirs that are inserted in the stand.  It isn&#x27;t a complete necessity, but I believe, not only is it more hygienic, but regular tap water inevitably contains minerals. Those minerals adhere to the cutting edges and their accumulation make the cutting action less effective, i.e., you&#x27;re not getting the sharpest shave. The reservoir fluid also contains lubricants to make the functioning more, well, fluid. That being said, I find the construction and finish of the included station honestly, well,  pitiful.  The 7 series station is head and shoulders more attractive, well designed and functional. This is one detail where I think Braun really stumbled badly and cheapened this package. For the $45 premium over the shaver alone, the included cleaning station is simply awful. If you own a 7 series with it&#x27;s cleaning station and put them side by side the difference in design, quality, and finish is laughable. Very surprising and disappointing from a premium company like Braun. If you can live with that then you&#x27;ll be happy with your purchase. If you don&#x27;t need the extra gentleness the Cooling factor this razor offers and want a shaver with the cleaning station, I would strongly recommend the Braun 790 package over this one.  The cleaning station is the reason I deducted one star and perhaps that was being too generous for such a premium brand as Braun.and effective product.

    <li> This is replacing my ten year old Braun shaver - a first generation Clean and Charge shaving \\&quot;system\\&quot; (Remember the good old days when you could buy a razor without having to get some cockamamie \\&quot;system\\&quot; to go along with it?!?!??!).  While I love my Braun, it is getting hard to find the right size replacement foil/cutter block for it.  Still runs great, just can&#x27;t seem to find replacement parts for it.  I therefore opted to go for a new \\&quot;system.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well.  I&#x27;ll start with the razor itself and move on to the system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor doesn&#x27;t use rotary blades, though the shape of the shaver itself implies that it does.  You have two banks of cutter blocks separated by a third cutting area designed to get longish hairs.  The blocks, in contrast to my old Braun, are spring-loaded, so you pretty much have to put pressure on it in order to get a close shave.  No worries, just a slight change from what I&#x27;m used to doing.  There is an angle to the shaver, and if you&#x27;re used to the traditional straight-line Braun design it will take some getting used to.  That all said, it works well - shaving goes quite well once you get the knack of it.  It also runs very quietly, which my family appreciates at 6:30 am.  Lastly, while there is a trimmer, I think it&#x27;s in a slightly awkward location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a little more agnostic about the \\&quot;cooling\\&quot; feature.  It&#x27;s a button on the shaver that makes a crossbar on the shaving head cool to the touch, ostensibly to reduce irritation.  I&#x27;m not sure about it - it just felt wet to me, but then I&#x27;ve been shaving so long my face is like leather - and when I first used it it felt more wet to me than cool.  The utility for others will probably be more than I got out of it, but unfortunately for me it&#x27;s more gimmick than help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now then, the system.  It comes with a charging station.  In contrast to the first generation Clean and Charge, this one charges automatically when you put the shaver in the block.  The old generation required you to manually push down a connection and then hit a button to start charging.  The block uses the same cleaning cartridges as the first gen, but they are loaded in the BACK of the stand, not the front.  This requires you to have to physically move the block in order to change cartridges.  My previous stand loaded from the front and it was very easy.  This one is a little more clumsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the cleaning itself, well, I recognize that it&#x27;s a way for Braun to create a revenue stream.  As I noted, I had my previous Braun for about ten years, and that&#x27;s a long time for a company to go without getting more money out of me.  So I bought the cartridges, which last me about a month before replacing.  At about $8 each, that&#x27;s something that had better give you some good benefit.  I&#x27;m thinking that regular use of the cartridges helped my previous shaver last as long as it has, so there&#x27;s probably something to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, I can&#x27;t fault Braun too much though - they make stuff that lasts for years.  I&#x27;m looking forward to another decade with this shaver.eneration required you to manually push down a connection and then hit a button to start charging.

    <li> I am a middle aged guy, and like many people here, tried lots of electric and foil shavers in my 20+ years of shaving.  I&#x27;ve owned several Braun foil shavers, and have always appreciated their build quality and durability, but the Cool Tec is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve used. The most high-end Braun shaver I&#x27;ve owned before this was the Braun Activator 5 series shaver, which delivered a very close facial shave and acceptable neck shave. The Cool Tec beats my Activator hands down-particularly in the neck area. Not as good as a high quality blade shave, but really close.  I also like the Cool Tec&#x27;s ergonomics-it is more narrow and easier to grip than my fat, rectangular Activator.  The Cool Tec rear beard trimmer is a little small, but excellent at trimming side burns (the best trimmer I have used on an electric shaver). The Cool Tec is also a wet/dry shaver that can be used in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the cooling feature was gimmicky at first, but it does work at providing a cooling sensation on your face.  You don&#x27;t have to use the cooling function-it&#x27;s activated by the light-up blue button in the middle of the shaver. The clean and charge station is simple to use and cleans your shaver in only 3 minutes (drying can take several hours however).  Simple tap water can also clean out your Cool Tec if you wish to prolong the life of your cleaning cartridges for up to two months.  You can also avoid using the clean and charge station altogether and manually wash your foil and cutting block in the faucet.  For under $200, the Cool Tec shaving system is a quality, versatile shaver that&#x27;s made in Germany and delivers a great shave.</li>
    <li> First things first: The cooling bar is truly amazing. The sensation it creates absolutely helps fight skin irritation and it reduces friction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, for as terrific as the cooling system is, the shave this model provides is TERRIBLE. It struggles with handling some five o&#x27;clock stubble. If you have any facial hair longer than a few millimeters, prepare to spend a great deal of time trying to get a close shave. At which point you&#x27;ll just give up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I respect (and as a tech-y early adopter appreciate) the innovation of this model, but this is first an foremost a shaving device. As such, it can not be recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had previously been using the top of the line Panasonic model, which despite it&#x27;s awful cleaning system and terrible customer support, provides a markedly closer shave.</li>
    <li> This shaver is solid and seems to have been ergonomically designed. It is easy to hold, well balanced, and easy to navigate around your face. It does a fine job under the nose and around the chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It provides a close shave, with minimal irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My current shaver, a Panasonic ES-LV81-K Arc 5 Mens Electric Shaver with Cleaning System, provides a closer shave but with more irritation. I think that is the tradeoff with electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Braun cleaning system better than the Panasonic. The Braun uses an alcohol based cleaner while the Panasonic uses a water based one. Even before a fluid change is due, the Panasonic develops a funky odor. This does not happen with the Braun. Also, the Panasonic cleaning cartridge filter out stubble on a sponge which often gets clogged with stubble if you don&#x27;t manually empty the stubble from the razor before starting the cleaning cycle. The Braun stores the stubble in the bottom of the fluid reservoir. It never gets clogged and you don&#x27;t need to manually clean out the stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I owned a different Braun with Clean and Renew years ago and had problems with the shaver breaking twice (once while in warranty, and finally while out of warranty). That is why I changed to the Panasonic which has given me no problems. I hope this Braun lasts longer. These shavers are too expensive to throw out after 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, about Cool Tec. Between the cutting foils there is a metal bar that gets cold when you turn on Cool Tec. To me, it makes the shaver feel wet (but it is really just cold). I don&#x27;t think it changes the level of irritation at all. It does not change the closeness of the shave. If you like the way it feels, great. To me this was just a gimmick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had them all, Norelco, Panasonic and now Braun. I got this Braun because after using Panasonic shavers for years, I thought maybe something different is better, after all, technology has come a long way right? Well, this Braun seems to glide across my face just fine, but I have those pesky little pockets of hair on my neck that are such a pain to get unless I use a blade. But then blades because so expensive, I went to using electric razors 90% of the time. I must admit, this razor just doesn&#x27;t match the cutting ability of my Panasonic. I will say its much better than any Norelco I&#x27;ve ever owned. Even to day, if I&#x27;m going out and want to look my best, I pull out my Razor shaver, because nothing beats the shave you get from a good blade and a little cream. Would I recommend this shaver? Not really, because for what it cost, I would first buy a Panasonic and throw in a few packs of blades to use as a backup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using a Panasonic and have been using this Braun Cooltec for about a week for this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things that I like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The shaver itself seems very well constructed.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Very smooth and quiet&lt;br /&gt;3.  After a bit of adaptation, it shaves as close as my Panasonic, though no better.&lt;br /&gt;4.  You get a travel base....see below.&lt;br /&gt;5.  The Cooltec actually works!  Feels like an ice cube gliding over your face.  It is that cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The main base is huge.  I mean HUGE.  Make counter space.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The main base is flimsy and a bit difficult to use.  Takes a bit of getting used to before I can get the shaver into proper position.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Although Cooltec is .... cool....I thought it&#x27;s gimmicky.  An electric shaver shouldn&#x27;t be that uncomfortable, and this one isn&#x27;t....so I don&#x27;t see Cooltec as functional.&lt;br /&gt;4.  The shave head is fixed.  It&#x27;s got floating foils, but after using the Panasonic&#x27;s movable head, I miss that feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I feel that this is a high quality shaver.  Does it&#x27;s job well and is a reasonable value.  Make sure you have plenty of counter space or else you&#x27;ll find yourself doing what I do and that is use the travel base and toss the bulky cleaning base.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Braun 7 series shaver for quite some time and have been very happy with it, so I was excited to try out the new Braun Cool Tec shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing I noticed out of the box, is that the Cool Tec is bulkier than the 7 series.  It&#x27;s still substantial as far as weight goes but the overall quality does seem like a step backwards.  Ergonomically, it fit well in my hands though, so it does feel like I have good control when maneuvering the shaver around my face, chin, and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the shave is good.  It takes a few more passes than the 7 series which is understandable since the motor on the Cool Tec isn&#x27;t as strong.  The non-swiveling head also took some time to get used to since getting around some of the curves and angles takes a bit more work.  I consider myself having a medium coarse beard and the Cool Tec cut through the hair effectively.  My skin is only mildly sensitive so irritation with the Cool Tec has never been an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a push up trimmer/edger that works as expected.  It trimmed my sideburns and the edge of my mustache easily.  My one complaint about this is the trimming blade is too narrow for my liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cooling feature on this shaver does seem gimmicky at first, but I have to admit it is a pretty &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; feature.  There is a thin bar between the two shaving foils that feels cool on your skin as you&#x27;re shaving.  Since my skin is not very prone to irritation, I&#x27;m not sure how helpful this is in that regard but it seems like it would help with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although manual cleaning is simple with this shaver, the cleaning station in this kit is still useful.  Regular cleaning with tap water may induce mineral build up which in time may result in dulling of the cutting blades.  The solution in the cleaning station would prevent that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my 7 series shaver is easier to use and not as bulky feeling as the Cool Tec but the 7 series is more expensive.  At this price point, I think this shaver is a worthwhile purchase.ensive.  At this price point, I think this shaver is a worthwhile purchase.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as well as Braun cruzer. I have to shave multiple times to ensure clean shave, would not recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Stopped  using Lazer blade forever.</li>
    <li> Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System 1 Kit is Very good shaving system, Clean the base is very easy to use. Very clean shave.</li>
    <li> Does this razor shave as close as a blade?  No, but it is very close and provides a very good shave.  I have had the Braun Series 7-760cc Pulsonic Shaver for a few years now and this shaver shaves about like it does.  The cooling function doesn&#x27;t really add a lot to the shave for me, as my other razor is very comfortable and doesn&#x27;t cause any burning.  The clean and renew system works the same and is a great idea.  Just put the razor in the charging base and press the clean button and let it go; your razor will be cleaned and lubricated for your next shave.  This works very well and is great, BUT the costs do add up, as you will go through the cleaning solution, as it will evaporate all the time after it is opened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this razor, but I still prefer my Braun Series 7-760cc.  I am just more accustomed to my current shaver, so this is just my personal preference, as either will do a great job.</li>
    <li> You would have to use this everyday to clear the stubble. If you don&#x27;t use it for 2 or 3 days you should just break out the disposable razor and cream</li>
    <li> I used to use disposable blades, but have been looking for something that will reduce the irratation.  The cooltec took some getting used to (it is cold) but after a couple weeks of using it works great.  I really like the cleaning system that comes with it.  Easy to take care of.  I got mine through program for free from Braun.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaving kit thinking I would get a clean smoothe shave but instead I started getting razor bumps.  In less than a month, my face had transformed to a plethora of razor bumps.</li>
    <li> The best sistem of shaving, connect the fastest reduction of heat on skin and a fast reductions of irritations. For me, actually, it&#x27;s one of the best solution.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Braun razors since... well, I guess since I was able to afford them, back in the late &#x27;90s. My current daily driver is the [[ASIN:B003YJAZZ4 Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System]], which is really quite good. But, I was really drawn in by the CoolTec, as though having a razor that got cold would make for a more refreshing morning routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well... it feels weird. I&#x27;ll say that from the start. The center of the foil is a solid piece of metal that gets cold, and as it glides across your face, you feel the coldness. Don&#x27;t expect the blue wraparound to mean anything. It&#x27;s just decoration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I&#x27;d get used to it, but because the CoolTec doesn&#x27;t have a pivoting head, that cold piece of metal seems almost to prevent getting a very close shave. It&#x27;s not like a foil can come in at an angle, cut the hair, and then get touched by the cool piece. It&#x27;s all just one contiguous block that can go no deeper than the metal allows. If you&#x27;ve never used a Panasonic, or Braun 5 / 7 series, this probably doesn&#x27;t mean much to you. On the other hand, if that&#x27;s where you&#x27;re coming from, I&#x27;m sure this is a major consideration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clean &amp; Renew system is the same one we&#x27;ve all come to appreciate for a decade or more, though with each new model, I&#x27;m mildly disappointed to see that there&#x27;s really been no innovation there. It&#x27;s very much the same as it was a decade ago, save for the charging contacts being relocated. Speaking of charging, I really don&#x27;t appreciate that the AC adapter can&#x27;t just be plugged in to this when traveling. It comes with a cheesy mini-dock that I guess is designed to be reasonably safe if it gets accidentally submerged, but is annoying for those of us who have managed to make it through life having not electrocuted ourselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost of the CoolTec puts you right in line with a [[ASIN:B001P5HCKK Braun Series 5-590cc Men&#x27;s Shaving System]], and if you can live without wet / dry or a cold head, it&#x27;s a much better razor. Or, if you can swing it, I&#x27;d spend the fifty bucks more and get the Series 7-790cc, for an infinitely better razor.t&#x27;s a much better razor.

    <li> I received my Braun Cooltec shaver from Braun as a progam campaign.  I&#x27;ve always used traditional razors having a bad experience with other electric shavers.  The Braun Cooltec shaver is the &amp;#34;coolest&amp;#34; electric shaver, ever.  The shaver doesn&#x27;t get cool, it gets cold which really gives some relief to the friction of shaving.  I have sensitive skin and the cool effect all but eliminates the irritation of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver absolutely shaves just as close as my traditional razor so I get the smooth shave that I expect and love.  The only complaint that I have and I will need to see if it continues is that I find it difficult to shave my neck with the Cooltec razor and I needed to go over my neck with my regular razor just to get the shave I wanted.  I&#x27;m not going to say it was the shaver as it could be my unique skin and hair type but this is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the self cleaning base so that I always get a clean ready to go shaver after every use.  I do have some concerns that the constant charging is going to deminish battery life in the long term but only time will tell with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am exceptionally happy with this shaver and it really is going to be a nice change from my traditional razor.  No more nicks or razors to buy and with the CoolTec feature skin irritation is GONE!  Thank you, Braun for the CoolTec razor product campaign, I finally don&#x27;t mind shaving everyday!</li>
    <li> I am a Braun Shaving veteran if there ever was one.  I started around 1990 with a Braun Flex Control 4550, and have since used the 5520 Flex Integral, 6520 Flex Integral, 8585 Activator (first one with clean/charge station), 3-390CC, and the 7-760CC Pulsonic.  Why do I bother telling you this?  First of all, none of my Braun shavers have ever died on me.  They were/are all literally still working when they were replaced.  Why replace them?  Because the new ones were so awesome!  New features, longer battery life, more power, better looking, etc.  Summary:  Braun Shavers are very reliable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun CoolTec (CT5CC)is the first shaver on the market with cooling technology.  Based on my experience with Braun shavers, and based on direct comparison with my 7-760CC, I think the CoolTec is a unique new product by Braun, for a certain market segment, but not necessarily for every man.  If you have a tough time shaving due to irritation, razor/shaver burn, etc., then this shaver is definitely worth a try.  If you have very tough, thick, course facial hair and like to shave in a hurry, then this shaver may not be for you.  The CoolTec does indeed cool and sooth your face.  There is a thin aluminum bar mounted between each shaver foil, that glides over your face, cooling and soothing as you shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How much cooling does it do?  I actually measured it with a thermometer.  I started with my room temperature CoolTec that was 68 degrees, ran the shaver for a minute or so, and the cooling bar got all the way down to 40 degrees.  I think that is a very significant amount of cooling, almost to the temperature of ice!  Imagine 40 degrees gliding over your 98 degree face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cooling capability of this shaver comes with some trade-offs.  For example, compared with my 7-760CC, the CoolTec is less powerful, and doesn&#x27;t handle my neck and other awkward hairs nearly as well.  Instead it is slower, definitely quieter (which I like), and takes longer to get a satisfactory shave.  When I am done, though, I have a very good shave.  It is very smooth!  With each new Braun shaver I think it is important to be able to adapt to the new shaver&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses.  At the end of the day, a new shaver should give a close shave.  My 7-760CC gives a close shave too, especially when it has new blades.  The 7-760CC can go through 2-3 days worth of stubble like a hot knife through butter.  But it sounds like one of those small gas powered remote control aircraft.  The CoolTec is quiet like the Braun shavers of 20+ years ago.  In my mind, this is the biggest trade-off, power and speed of shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other notables:  The CoolTec will struggle around the chin, jaw line, and under the nose for some, because the distance between the two foils is wider, to allow room for the cooling bar and the middle trimmer.  The shaver really feels more like two single foil shavers, one after the other, rather than a twin foil shaver that feels like one.  I have learned to adapt to this my slowing down my pace in these areas, and really using a single foil.  The mustache/side-burn trimmer is sub-par for a Braun shaver in my opinion.  The shaver is very comfortable to hold and grip.  Braun has managed to shrink the footprint of the clean/charge station.  Ergonomically, the whole package is awesome, but I&#x27;m used to that with Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I&#x27;m keeping the CoolTec and replacing my 7-760CC.  I like the soothing and cooling, I can achieve a very good shave (it just takes a little more time), I like the quietness, and the overall product is very attractive and innovative.  I&#x27;m docking the CoolTec one star for the sub-par trimmer, and lack of power.  Fortunately for Braun, this shaver is so over-the-top innovative that I started with 6 stars, so the final score is 5 stars for me.satisfactory shave.

    <li> I have been using electric razors for about 20 years, now. In that time, I have owned three Braun shavers (including this one) and two Panasonic shavers. While my current Panasonic electric razor is working fine, I ordered this one as a free trial unit when I had the chance. I ordered a similar razor for my father a year ago for Christmas, and I know he was happy with it. After using it for a couple of weeks, here are my overall impressions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This unit is solidly-built and appears to be a high-quality instrument.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. This razor is fully watertight and can be used in the shower. I don&#x27;t happen to shave in the shower (more likely I find myself shaving in the car), but if you want to do that, you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I can barely feel this thing cutting at all. It&#x27;s a very smooth cut. It almost feels like I am rubbing a smooth stone across my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. This unit is very quiet. It has probably 1/3 the operating volume of my Panasonic razor, which my wife can appreciate, as I can now easily hear her talking while I am shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The CoolTec device is kind of neat and DOES seem to work. However, this razor gives such a nice cut without it that it doesn&#x27;t really seem necessary. Perhaps on other people&#x27;s faces that are easily irritated it would offer more benefit?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. The razor comes with a pretty nice travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Due to the cleaning technology designed into the charging base, this unit is less likely to develop a funky smell than other razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. The beard edging tool is pretty good. It&#x27;s not the best I have ever seen/used, but it is better than the one on the Panasonic razor I had been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This razor has a heft to it more resembling a power tool than an electric razor. It is definitely the heaviest razor I have ever owned. I don&#x27;t know if this is necessarily good or bad, it all depends on the user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The charging unit has a bigger footprint than most razors are going to have. You need to be aware of this prior to buying it, as if you have a tiny bathroom that doesn&#x27;t have a lot of space, you don&#x27;t want to take up what limited sink space you have with this large unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Once you have loaded the cleaning fluid into the charging base, you better make sure you don&#x27;t tip it over. My wife moved my razor to plug in her own hair management tools and she knocked over the base, causing a leak of flammable liquid. You average razor is not going to require so much attention and allowance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Aside from the high cost of the unit, itself, the cleaning fluid refill cartridges are not cheap. I have not owned this unit long enough to justify purchasing more cartridges, but I am aware of their cost, and it isn&#x27;t cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The head on this razor is fixed. Some razors have a sort of bendable neck that allows the razor to change positions on it&#x27;s own to better follow the contours of you face. This razor cannot do that, and this is probably the single biggest difference between my old Panasonic and this one. It is also the feature that I will miss the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a very nice razor with some very nice features. I hope to get a few good years (or more) out of it. While it may be one of the finest razors on the market, you&#x27;ll have to carefully weigh whether you will want to spend so much on a razor when many cheaper options will offer you a fine shave without all of the frills that come with this model.otprint than most razors are going to have. You need to be aware of this prior to buying it, as if you have a tiny bathroom that doesn&#x27;t have a lot of space, you don&#x27;t want to take up what limited sink space you have with this large unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Once you have loaded the cleaning fluid into the charging base, you better make sure you don&#x27;t tip it over. My wife moved my razor to plug in her own hair management tools and she knocked over the base, causing a leak of flammable liquid. You average razor is not going to require so much attention and allowance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Aside from the high cost of the unit, itself, the cleaning fluid refill cartridges are not cheap. I have not owned this unit long enough to justify purchasing more cartridges, but I am aware of their cost, and it isn&#x27;t cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The head on this razor is fixed.

    <li> I&#x27;m more of a multi-blade cartridge/shaving cream kind of guy.  But I also love gadgets.  So when Braun gave me the opportunity to try the new CT5cc, I jumped on it immediately.  The quality and fit and finish of the equipment is great.  It had a good weight and feels expensive.  Being a fan of a hot shave, I wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d like the cooling action - but it was pretty nice.  Refreshing even.  I also like the charging/cleaning station.  Really convenient to just set the shaver back in it and next time I&#x27;m ready, I&#x27;ve got a fresh, clean razor that charged and ready to go.  All that said, I wasn&#x27;t blown away with the actual shave.  As far as electric shavers go, it&#x27;s pretty good.  I shave my whole head, so  there&#x27;s a lot of real estate to cover.  Did an great job on my face, but struggled a bit on the rest of my head.  Plus, it took 3 or 4 times as long to get a comparable shave.  However, I&#x27;m glad to have it my arsenal and it a great alternative for a quick shave in the car or for travel.</li>
    <li> A shaver, no matter how many bells and whistles, is only as good as the actual shave. This Braun CoolTec is fancy and the CoolTec feature does help reduce irritation but the problem, for me at least, is that this shaver is based on the Braun 5 series which is slower and just doesn&#x27;t deliver the best shave. So while your skin may not be as irritated, you are also not getting a great shave--random stubs will be left and thicker hairs will sometimes feel &amp;#34;chewed&amp;#34; instead of shaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of this, I feel that it simply fails that main task so it isn&#x27;t worth recommending unless you have used a Braun series 5 and liked it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned Braun shavers for 20+ years, and they have been the best in my opinion. This model was especially inviting because of the thought of reduced razor burn.  It does feel good while I shave, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduced razor burn.  It is also clunky and heavy compared to my previous series 7.  Much slower shave than the 7, and I wish I had just bought another ultrasonic 7 at this point.  I prefer the slide trimmer of this model to the flip variety found on the 7, but that&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> Not really happy with this one. The positive thing about this really is the cooling feature which works great. The downside is that it just doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as my older Series 3 Contour (5735). I think the cooling band just frankly gets in the way and makes the difficult neck hairs impossible for the blades to pick up. This added overall depth causes me to need several more strokes than I would otherwise need thus irritating the skin anyway. The cooling feels great, but pointless if it doesn&#x27;t shave. I wish I would have kept my 10 year old 5735.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of experience with electric shavers (20+ years) using several different brands and models. Before trying this Braun Cool Tec, I was using an old Braun Syncro 7540 (about $180), which was my primary shaver years ago, but I had switched out shavers several times since then and came back to it for its simplicity and reliability.  Before that, my favorite was a [[ASIN:B001DEYP8K Remington F5790]].  I quit using that because I got a bad replacement foil that wouldn&#x27;t stay on, and after going back to my old Braun for a while, I just stayed with it (partly because it&#x27;s far more comfortable than the Remington).  Before that, I was using a Panasonic ES8109 (about $180) for a year. Before that, I used the Braun Syncro 7540 for years. Before that, I used several Remington dual foils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the biggest problems I have with electric shavers is that they tend to irritate my skin and it just seems like it takes forever to finish shaving.  I&#x27;ve always dreaded shaving every morning.  Enter the Braun Cool Tec.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOISE: The first thing I noticed about it was that it&#x27;s VERY quiet.  I just happened to have a decibel meter handy, so I measured the sound level by the foil: 76 dB.  Then I measured my old Braun: 95 dB.  Big difference!  I hadn&#x27;t realized just how annoying it was having that loud buzzing around my ears every morning.  Shaving with this new Braun gives me a whole different outlook.  I actually don&#x27;t dread shaving, and I think the reduced noise level is a big factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COMFORT: This Braun Cool Tec is definitely more comfortable than my old Braun; in fact, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve had a more comfortable shave.  The cutters on all shavers get hot after a while (I seem to remember this being a particularly bad problem with the Panasonic), so the introduction of a cooling bar between the two cutters is brilliant.  It keeps them cooler, and it also keeps your skin cooler, which is definitely pleasant and soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the head seemed to drag more than I&#x27;m used to, especially at first, but this did not translate to increased irritation or discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLOSENESS: I&#x27;ve had closer shaves (notably from the Remington), but the shave this Braun delivers isn&#x27;t bad at all, and as I&#x27;ve gotten used to it, I&#x27;ve gradually improved the closeness.  The head does not pivot (probably because of the cooling system), and that might factor into the shave quality.  You have to consciously remember to keep the shaver at a 90-degree angle (rather than letting pivoting action do most of the work for you).  I find that it helps to take note if I can feel the cooling bar or not.  If you can&#x27;t feel it, you probably don&#x27;t have the head flat against your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEANING: Like other Braun self-cleaning shavers, this model delivers a spotlessly clean shaver every time you run the clean cycle.  The cycle runs for just three minutes, but this model does not have a drying cycle (my old Braun did), so if you decide to clean your shaver at the last minute, it&#x27;s going to be wet.  In fact, the directions specify that it will take \\&quot;several hours\\&quot; to dry.  In a pinch, you could probably take the shaver out of the stand, remove the head, and run a hairdryer on it.  But I miss that drying cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ACCESSORIES: This shaver comes with a small brush for cleaning out the cutters (not necessary if you run the clean cycle regularly), a semi-rigid travel case, and a \\&quot;cradle\\&quot; for charging the shaver without the cleaning stand (such as for travel).  I would have liked the case, but there is no room for the cord or the cradle, so it&#x27;s not really well designed.  You absolutely will not want to travel more than just overnight without your cord and cradle because each charge is reported to only last 15 minutes when using the cooling feature (45 minutes without it, but then what&#x27;s the point of having the cooling feature if you don&#x27;t use it?).  There is no screen protector, other than the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHERCONSIDERATIONS:  As with other waterproof shavers, this Braun cannot be used with the cord, so once the battery gives out (as all rechargeables do), the life of the shaver is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer works well and is located on the back of the shaver.  When you pop it up (it locks down to prevent doing this accidentally), it slides out from the body of the shaver a bit.  I think I prefer the position of the trimmer on my old Braun, but this one isn&#x27;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a very good shaver, and I recommend it wholeheartedly.</li>
    <li> Great product. Love the feel of the cold bar and the handy charging base. The cooling feature is great for sensitive skin like mine where I break out after shaving. Nice to use before or during a shower.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because the Cooling bar feature. This is the only great thing and that works well. The shaver blades do not give a close shave.  I have to do several shaves in order to get a better shave which adds more time to the morning process! I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Overall I have found the Braun CoolTec to be an above average electric shaver.  However, if you are a razor user, you will be disappointed.  I received this shaver through a program run by Bruan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is very solid and feels good in your hand.  I like that you can get the shaver wet as it is sealed and contained.  Having a cleaning station for an electric shaver is a must!  This was probably the best feature of all.  Each morning, I removed the shaver it was cleaned and oiled.  It even has a fresh &#x27;lemony&#x27; sent that is very pleasant.  The cold aluminum bar does help lower the irritation.  I usually buy shaving cream when I use a razor that also has a cooling effect on the face so this was a welcomed experience.  Unfortunately I have found that if I have any more than 24 hours of growth, the shaver works very very poorly.  I had to go back 5 times over the same spot and stretch the skin every which way just to get those longer stubbles, definitely nothing I had to do with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Fresh and clean shaver each morning&lt;br /&gt;Always charged and ready&lt;br /&gt;Able to get wet&lt;br /&gt;Cooling action reduced irritation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Ineffective on greater than 24 hr growth&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning station is large on the counter top&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning station is noisy</li>
    <li> After trying three different electric shaving systems, I no longer need to look for another.  The Braun is the one!  Received a Philips Norelco AT810 which was very good.  Good shave, held a decent charge.  A bit difficult to maneuver along jaw line. 2 year warranty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic ES8103S gave me a bit closer shave, especially on dry skin.  1 year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System was top of the line.  Great for my sensitive skin.  No problems over chin/jawline.  The cooling was the best...like I said...especially for my sensitive skin and *if* you live in a climate where the weather affects your skin.  There is an alcohol cleaning system to eliminate germs...think &amp;#34;infection control&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies~ the Braun&#x27;s the one you&#x27;re guy will thank you for.  The tough guy&#x27;s sensitive.  Treat him to this one.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, cool feeling, buy a slightly higher price, sounds okay, clean the barrel very domineering, did not compare with the 790, do not know which is better</li>
    <li> I bought one and the wash basin burned out within 2 months. Great idea and nice razor just really bad cleaning machine that doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun shavers in the past, and they have consistently given a close, clean shave.  As a shaver alone, the CoolTec raises the bar with its innovative cooling bar and top-in-class hair cutting technology.  Although, I have not had a problem with irritation or sensitive skin, the cooling delivers a soothing sensation while you shave.&lt;br /&gt;My frustration with this version of CoolTec, the CT5, is the function and design of many of its accessories.  I expect more from a shaver of this quality and price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CoolTec gives a smoother, less irritating shave, because the razor does not heat up your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Excellent shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cooling feature feels great.  The sensation comes from a piezoelectric strip of metal between the 2 sides of cutting foils.  The result is a smoother, less irritating shave, because the razor does not heat up your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomic design that makes it easy to hold, there is even a thumb rest in the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning/Charging Unit takes the fuss and worry out of these functions.  Also, Braun uses the same cleaning cartridges that are in their older shavers&#x27; cleaning units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;There is a whole family of shavers in the CT family. The manual is for all, but because not all have all features, there all sorts of exceptions in the manual.  Really, how hard it would be to just have separate manuals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver left in the cleaning unit is supposed to dry in a few hours.  Even left overnight, mine does not dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no cover for the razor foils.  This is quite disappointing, especially since others in this CT series do.  It is kind of perplexing why this one does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of plugging in directly to charge like in older models, you need to seat the razor in a small cradle that plugs in. The cradle was not designed well, as the shaver does not just naturally slip into place. Although there is a great travel case for the razor, you  are left to cram this cradle and cord/plug whereever you can fit it. Since the razor only holds a 15 minute charge when using the cooling function (and why buy this model if you are not going to), that is only about 3 shaves. So unless, you are only going away for the weekend, you will need to bring the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The display is minimal.  Common in shavers (and in older Braun models) is an indicator of charge status, minutes left, etc.  This shaver does not have that.  Because the cooling function is such an energy hog, this is especially important.are left to cram this cradle and cord/plug whereever you can fit it.

    <li> Full disclosure I received my Braun CoolTec shaver through a program run by Braun. Coming off of No Shave November I thoroughly enjoyed what this shaver had to offer.  The long hair trimmer really helped me jumpstart the shave back to the clean face look. The cooling bar also really helped my sensitive skin and reduced redness almost instantly. I have tried all sorts of other shavers in the past and have always been left with red bumps and that itchy feeling but the Braun CoolTec system magically made all of that go away. I am the kind of person that hates using a used/dirty shaver and the cleaning system makes this the easiest thing ever. Shave, pop the shaver into the station, then the next shave again like it&#x27;s a brand new unit. Perfecto!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the price is a little steep - I would thoroughly recommend this to anyone who has any form of difficulty shaving. It&#x27;s like a magic eraser for your face!! So soft &amp; smooth!</li>
    <li> I am a long time electric razor user and for at least 10 years having been using Braun.  My older unit finally died and I decided to try the &#x27;latest&#x27; and pre-ordered this on Amazon before it was actually for sale.  Others have commented on the cooling feature (interesting, but doubt if it helps the shave itself) and the lack of irritation (which as I get older is important!).  I would say I find the button placement very poor. I constantly am holding the razor and shutting off the large &#x27;cooling&#x27; button with my thumb by mistake, The shaver seems much too top heavy and actually is NOT as comfortable to hold as my old Braun: in fact, it&#x27;s almost tiresome to hold this razor but luckily it doesn&#x27;t take long to shave.  The shave seems about normal for an electric, but whether I would recommend you go for the &#x27;cool tek&#x27; feature is up to you wanting to spend the extra $30 or so. Its novel, but really creates some weight in the razor, and the new design of the shaver itself is disappointing.  And remember once you buy these self-cleaning models, you are on the hook for the cleaning fluid replacements about every month. Having said all that, I am so used to this whole Braun system it was easy to adopt to this new razor,  and after a month of use, I have learned to hold it better - though I still find it heavy and clunky in my hand.</li>
    <li> Been using Braun foils for 15 years. I like to use this one in the shower. Does a good job. Very close, but does miss a few spots and requires feeling around for stubble. Hard to trim your sideburns with this one. Has a tiny pop up side trimmer that is almost useless. The cool tec is kind of a neat feature. Not sure how it works, but it does feel cool to to touch. Kind of a gimmick. Not sure if I can tell any difference.</li>
    <li> The Braun Cool Tec razor is a fine electric razor. I compared this razor to my two year old Panasonic razor, and frankly, I don&#x27;t see much of a difference. They are both excellent razors - the Braun is less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to do a direct comparison of these two shavers, this Braun Cool Tec and my two year old Panasonic ES-LV61-A (at introduction, an outrageously expensive razor - $500 - but now closer in price to the Braun at $270). Prior to the Panasonic, I shaved with a manual razor. In the interest of comparison, I shaved half my face with the Braun and the other half with the Panasonic. I shaved every day for a week and compared the two sides. The smooth face conclusion - basically there is no difference between the two razors. It comes down to little things for the differences. If you count the cost of Clean and Renew cartridges over time, the two razors are essentially the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cooling effect is really neat science. There is a solid state Peltier effect cooler inside this razor. These coolers get cold very fast, don&#x27;t use a lot of electricity, and have no moving parts. They aren&#x27;t used in air conditioning systems because they aren&#x27;t efficient in large size. In the center of the cutting head there is a metal bar that gets cold. Within about 15 seconds of turning on the razor, I can feel the cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea behind cold is to close your pores down and make your hair stand on end. It is a good reasonable idea - if hairs are standing up, the razor can cut the hair easily and cleanly. In practice, that seems to be what is going on, I get a good clean shave. The cold felt weird the first few days, but after that I got used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the feel of this razor. The body is just about the right size for my hand. The head is easy to pull off for cleaning. The razor makes a slightly deeper sound that I didn&#x27;t like at first, but have gotten used to it now. The side burns trimmer is really super nice. Because the head is smaller, I can see where that trimmer is working. The trimmer cuts hair super-fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is water proof, so it could be used in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system is nice. This uses the Clean and Renew cartridges Braun has used with their razors for years. The silly stand makes a ton of noise when it runs (not a nice noise either). While in the stand, the razor is charged. The cartridges are about $5 each and last about two or three months. We&#x27;ve had a Braun shaver in the house for a long time - price varies a lot and a 3 pack isn&#x27;t always more expensive than a 12 pack, [[ASIN:B007SNGSFS Braun Clean &amp; Renew Cartridge Refills, Frustration Free 4 Count]]. The unopened cartridges have an infinite shelf life. There are sites that describe how to cheap out and reuse the cartridge, it isn&#x27;t worth all the trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging is weird; I actually hate the charging system. There are two metal studs on the razor. On the charging stand there are two metal studs that match up for charging. For traveling, the AC adapter plugs into an included plastic carrier. The razor then sits in that carrier to charge. There is no indicator for percent charge. The power button is either green or some other color to indicate low battery. The manual keeps repeating, once the color changes, you will have enough charge to finish your shave. The adapter, carrier, stud thing is just needlessly complicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foil and cutter come as a kit, and should be replaced roughly once a year. The kit is reasonable at $40. [[ASIN:B00DB5Q26M BRAUN 40B Foil and Cutter Replacement Cartridge for CoolTec shavers series]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure I like my Panasonic better. The differences are really small and maybe not worth the premium price. The Panasonic&#x27;s cutting head swivels making it easier to follow my face. The Braun is supposed to be kept at 90 degrees to my face, just a little harder to do. The Panasonic has 5 cutting heads and the Braun onlyhas 3. I was able to shave closer to my nose with the Panasonic because the cutters are closer to the edge of the head. The Panasonic is super simple to charge and has a percent remaining on the display. When traveling I only have to carry an AC adaptor; with the Braun I have to carry the adapter and the carrier, break, lose, or forget that carrier and I can&#x27;t charge the razor. I also know how long I can go with the Panasonic based on the percentage left. With the Braun, it could run out any time. I like the noise the Panasonic makes a bit better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun has some advantages. I like the cooling effect, which has been nice. I love the long hair trimmer and how easy it is to see where it is cutting. I like the feel of the handle, it is bigger and meatier. I really like the idea behind the cleaning system. The alcohol and oil to clean out the shaving head is a great idea. The travel case is much nicer - the Braun is a nice rigid case, the Panasonic is a soft vinyl case. The Braun does a much better job down south. In theory neither razor is supposed to be used below the neck. The head on the Braun is narrower and can get into tighter places, actually making easy work of those zones. The head is a lot less complicated. The cutting head is way cheaper than the Panasonic, $40 versus about $90 total for the Panasonic. But the Clean and Renew cartridges make up the difference (they both still get you).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun has four electric razor series, 1, 3, 5, and 7. I can&#x27;t tell from the marketing information which razor series is the Cool Tec without the cooling. Without a direct comparison, it is impossible to figure the upcharge for the cooling device. And I don&#x27;t have any of those razors to compare to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a fine razor. It can run with the big expensive dogs. On my face it performed equally to my Panasonic razor. The cool is a neat idea; I like the science and the gadgetry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B005GNL5G4 Panasonic ES-LV61-A Men&#x27;s Electric Razor Arc 5 Multiflex Pivoting Head]]has 3.

And I don&#x27;t have any of those razors to compare to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a fine razor. It can run with the big expensive dogs. On my face it performed equally to my Panasonic razor. The cool is a neat idea; I like the science and the gadgetry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B005GNL5G4 Panasonic ES-LV61-A Men&#x27;s Electric Razor Arc 5 Multiflex Pivoting Head]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sooo excited, I just received my new Braun CoolTec shaver provided to me through a program via Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the new Braun CoolTec shaver and was immediately impressed by the quality of the shaver and accessories. The shaver itself felt solid in my hand and fit perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;After setting it up, which was easy and charging it, I used it for the first time.. I intentionally grew out some stubble to see what this shaver could do..&lt;br /&gt;I was BLOWN AWAY by how effortlessly the CoolTec shaved my face down to sift skin.. I only did half my face..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then activated the CoolTec function of the shaver and shaved the other half.. The cooling sensation actually worked. The shaver head felt cold and soothed my skin as it shaved..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed by this Braun product and will recommend it to every guy I know.. It&#x27;s simply amazing!!</li>
    <li> very interesting technology, I could actually feel the coolness and noticed less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Great to have self cleaning for the head and last a good amount of time on a charge. Personally I still prefer to shave manually as opposed to electric but it&#x27;s a good device.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a regular user of Braun&#x27;s shaving products. I have a Braun Series 5 system with the Clean &amp; Renew feature which uses an alcohol solution to clean and freshen your razor to give you a clean like &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; feeling every time you use it. I was offered through a program by Braun to evaluate the Braun °CoolTec System. Figuring my unit is pretty old and it&#x27;s nearing the end of its&#x27; life, why not replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several weeks of use, initial thoughts are pretty good. If you have an existing system that utilizes the Clean &amp; Renew cartridges (CCR) the °CoolTec System will use them so it keeps you from having to buy new cartridges and dumping your old ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cooling feature somehow extracts the heat away from the razor as opposed to existing razors where it gets pretty warm or hot on top giving you that wonderful razor burn aka skin irritation. If you don&#x27;t like it that cold. you can turn it off by pressing the little snowflake button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a handy travel case as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Utilizes existing Clean &amp; Renew cartridges (CCR)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving performance pretty good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cooling factor prevents razor burn/skin irritation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rechargeable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean &amp; Renew cartridge needs to be inserted from the back. Previous systems were inserted from the front which is very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean &amp; Renew base bulky. Much larger than previous systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charger is bulky. The head is really large compared to previous models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer function is awkwardly built. It looks like it was an afterthought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a good functional Braun shaver that is compatible with existing Clean &amp; Renew cartridges (CCR). It could use some slimming down to make it less bulky. Perhaps the next generation will address these issues. If you don&#x27;t have one already, Braun is a solid shaver manufacturer considering my switch from Remington to Braun.</li>
    <li> I received a free Braun CoolTec System as part of a program run by Braun.  I have had the chance to use it for several weeks to construct an opinion for this review.  I am a regular electric shaver user - previously using a Braun 8595 shaver for around 8 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CoolTec Shaver comes with a Clean &amp; Charge station, as most Braun shavers have been using for a while.  It uses the same replaceable liquid cleaner as others, which is very convenient.  The station is larger than the ones from other shavers.  It looks nice, and the razor fits in nicely.  However, it is larger than others with the cleaning solution going in the rear of the unit, rather than the front which makes it slightly harder to change.  The station looks good when clean, but being a glossy black it can get dirty looking very quickly.  Also, this unit isn&#x27;t as \\&quot;smart\\&quot; as my 8 year old unit.  The older one \\&quot;talks\\&quot; to the razor to know how dirty it is and displays that as well as displays the level of the cleaning solution.  The new one does not do that.  One I improvement with the new CoolTec cleaning station is that it is much quieter than the older one - it used to be that everyone in the house could hear when the razor was cleaning itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CoolTec razor itself is a nice size to hold, and it comfortable for the most part.  The only thing that I have had an issue with regarding the size / shape is the button for the cooling feature.  There is a slight indentation above this for you to put your thumb while shaving, but it is very easy to hit the cooling button accidentally which turns off the cooling feature.  Many times I have stopped to look at the razor to see that the cooling feature had been accidentally turned off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cooling feature is pretty neat.  After a few seconds, the razor does have a nice cool, refreshing feeling to it when it touches your skin.  It almost feels damp (although it isn&#x27;t), which makes it glide over your skin easily.  The cooling bar isin the middle of the razor, so it is easily felt on most of your face and neck.  It doesn&#x27;t work well on the upper lip, since my lip isn&#x27;t wider than the face of the razor with room to move it around to shave.  As far as the effectiveness of the cooling feature (less irritation), it&#x27;s hard to tell.  It definitely cools the skin for a second or two while shaving.  However, that advantage for less irritation may be offset by the number of times that I had to try to get an area to get a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor does an adequate job of shaving, however I don&#x27;t feel that it did as good of a job at getting a close shave as my 8 year old 8595.  It is definitely quieter and faster at shaving 95% of facial hair.  I did have problems with it getting everything, especially hairs that were laying flat.  Sometimes it felt like I was going over an area 10-15 times just to get 1-2 hairs that were laying flatter than the others on my neck.  That probably irritated my skin more than a non-cooling razor would, had it got the hairs on the first or second pass.  On the areas where it did cut (95%), it did a good job although not always as smooth as the older razor.  I have not had good luck with the pop-up trimmer at all.  I have had trouble getting good cut on my sideburns, and have even tried using it on the flat lying hairs that the main blades couldn&#x27;t get, but that didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think that this is a good razor  and the cooling feature really does work.  However, if  you don&#x27;t have skin irritation and have a little more money to spend, I think that there are better razors available.  I have already ordered the Braun Series 7 razor to try and get a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----  Update after continued use ----&lt;br /&gt;I think that the more that I use this razor, the less of a fan that I am, especially compared to other Braun razors.  I will focus mainly on the charging / cleaning station.  The other Braun razors \\&quot;talk\\&quot; to the charging / cleaning base andlock the razor in while cleaning - this one does not appear to.  After a while, I realized that the power button does light up when it is cleaning, however it can be removed from the cleaning base at any time during the clean.  It doesn&#x27;t recognize the high / medium / low levels of clean that the older/other razors do.  Additionally, there is no indication of how much longer is remaining in the clean, which the other razors do.  I feel that this is more of an entry level razor with the cooling gimmick attached to it.  If you want a good, clean shave go for one of the more established Braun models.</li>
    <li> Awful shaver but good money-back guarantee.  Braun was correct in calling this CoolTec because ColdTec would have been false advertising.  The bar merely gets cool to the touch and the shaver is the least close of any that I&#x27;ve tried in the past 5 years.  Only small decrease in irritation due to the blades not coming anywhere near your skin and nothing to do with the coolish bar in the middle of the shaving head.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an electric razor that used a cooling sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I like the fact that this razor fully charges in about an hour, versus some other razors that take about 8 hours to fully charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor comes with a charging cradle/shell, which I do like, or by using the Clean &amp; Charge Station, which uses this cleaning cartridge that to me smells liked rubbing alcohol.  Whichever one you use, you need to make sure that the metal contacts on either the charging cradle/shell or the Clean &amp; Charge Station connect with the metal contacts of the razor.  The unit will beep if you have done it correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you use the cleaning cartridge by pressing what looks like a snowflake on the razor, which is a large, blue button, right above the on/off button, it does feel cooling, but I found that it still made my skin feel irritated, like I had just shaved, like how all razors make me feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clean &amp; Charge Station is kind of large, which I did not like.  This razor does come with a hard shell storage case which I did like, but for some reason it does not come with any kind of protective cap for the top of the razor, like most electric razors do.  This razor does come with a small cleaning brush, and one cleaning cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I prefer the floating head type razor to this kind, which is a foil and cutter.  It does give you a close shave.  On the back of the razor it does have a trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handbook that comes with this razor is for several different Braun models, so it can be a little confusing to see exactly what applies to your razor, so make sure that you are reading the correct information for this model razor, which is Model # CT5cc.  They do suggest changing the foil and cutter every 18 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use this razor in the shower or rinse it clean under water.  You may use a liquid hand soap that is not abrasive, but if you do this on a regular basis they suggest that you apply a lubricant oil, a light machine oil to the foil and cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The do suggest that you use this razor before washing your face, without any foam or gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t find how long the warranty for this razor is.  It only came with a handbook which did not list how long the warranty is for, not a separate card that would show how long the warranty is.  I couldn&#x27;t find this information on the box either.</li>
    <li> I received the \\&quot;Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System\\&quot; to evaluate for the Vine program, and was looking forward to evaluating it based on my prior experience owning the [[ASIN:B000050FDQ Braun 7526 Syncro Shaver System with Clean &amp; Charge Storage Stand]] and the [[ASIN:B0002Q67EA Braun 8595 Activator Self-Cleaning Shaving System with LCD Display]]. These are my impressions after trying it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pluses (▲):&lt;br /&gt;▲ Well-constructed (designed and manufactured in Germany)&lt;br /&gt;▲ 2-year warranty/60-day money back guarantee (per their website)&lt;br /&gt;▲ Wet/Dry certified (usable in shower and washable)&lt;br /&gt;▲ \\&quot;Clean &amp; Renew\\&quot; system does a nice job; however it lacks the dry cycle (see below)&lt;br /&gt;▲ Li-Ion battery charges quickly...within an hour&lt;br /&gt;▲ Up to 45 minutes of shaving (but that is without using the cooling system)&lt;br /&gt;▲ Decent \\&quot;Precision Long-Hair Trimmer\\&quot; does the job on my mustache&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minuses (▼):&lt;br /&gt;▼ Non-pivoting head doesn&#x27;t work as well for me as their pivoting models&lt;br /&gt;▼ Overly-large charging cradle (only way to charge the shaver)&lt;br /&gt;▼ Cooling technology didn&#x27;t help in my case, and it consumes battery charge&lt;br /&gt;▼ Expensive maintenance (~$50/year for \\&quot;Clean &amp; Renew\\&quot;/Foil-Cutter accessories)&lt;br /&gt;▼ \\&quot;Clean &amp; Renew\\&quot; on this model missing dry cycle&lt;br /&gt;▼ Cannot plug shaver into AC power directly (completely dependent on battery)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I should mention that I shave my entire head/face/neck (except for my short &#x27;Van Gogh&#x27;) ;-)...and have been employing this regimen for over 15 years; I have tried everything from stropping my own \\&quot;Sweeny Todd\\&quot; razor to my wife&#x27;s depilatory devices...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, so I was curious about the \\&quot;CoolTec Technology.\\&quot; And when I tried it, it felt cool against the skin, as others have described...but, aside from the altered sensory experience, it did not appear to help with any reduction in irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, since this is a wet/dry model, I tried it in the shower, but I didn&#x27;t like using it (to be fair, I have yet to meet a wet electric shaver which I liked using...I prefer using [[ASIN:B003EMPN7G Gillette Venus Original Women&#x27;s Razor 1 Razor 2 Cartridges]] in the shower). Others may have a better experience.&lt;br /&gt;Braun sacrifices the ability to plug the shaver directly into AC power (probably part of the wet/dry design). Braun also recommends against using \\&quot;shaving foams, lotions, and gels [which] are not compatible with the alcohol-based cleaning solution and may potentially damage the device\\&quot;. Does this apply to shower usage as well? It would seem so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Clean &amp; Renew\\&quot; works nicely...they have been using this system for many years...but the consumables can add up cost-wise, and this model lacks the drying cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, while the shaver does a decent job and has some nice features, given the cost of buying and maintaining it, along with the drawbacks outlined above, I feel there are less-expensive and better-suited shaving solutions available., but I didn&#x27;t like using it (to be fair, I have yet to meet a wet electric shaver which I liked using...I prefer using [[ASIN:B003EMPN7G Gillette Venus Original Women&#x27;s Razor 1 Razor 2 Cartridges]] in the shower).

    <li> Having used many electric shavers since my beard started to grow out there is one criteria I use, mainly, for any new shavers I may use--although I have not changed my current electric razor in 7 years which was a Braun. This criteria is simply: is the shaving experience pleasant and can I, after finishing the shave, rub my hands *against* the grain without feeling anything? This is not to say the overall construction of the razor gets no mention, however, the first point for which I base my decision on a razor are the latter two points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Tip to Save Money on Refill Cartridges: [[ASIN:B007SNGSFS Braun Clean &amp; Renew Cartridge Refills, Frustration Free 4 Count]]****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was going to put this at the bottom however it is better suited for notice first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can make each cartridge last a very long time by keeping the plastic &#x27;tab&#x27; that you pull off when first using it and placing it back on top so that the water does not evaporate. When you put the tab on, slip the cartridge under the cleaning station and leave the station &#x27;up&#x27;. I replace my cartridges between 1 to 2 years (3 pack).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Products I have used in the past for comparison:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Braun 8595 Self Cleaning Razor (my current one I have been using for 7 years)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advantages: Solid, metal like construction, able to be very &#x27;precise&#x27; with where you shave, butt-smooth (for those who are bald there) shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- All others encompassing the &#x27;3 circled shavers&#x27; with various brands. They were all subpar and thus get no mention. It should also speak loudly that I do not use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the Braun CoolTec, the review lies on its comparison with the Braun 8595, which many will tell you, is close to perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**My Beard**:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prickly, thick and dark brown. The hairs themselves are somewhat shiny, little slick, and very strong. This will give you an idea of how hard it is for me to &#x27;look&#x27; clean shaven--very hard to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun CoolTec overall rating: 9/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[---Shave---] 8.5/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s get straight to the point, shall we?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being since the &#x27;straight&#x27; foil razors are my preference for closeness of shave and precision, the CoolTec immediately feels like other Braun razors so the transition is not difficult (there is a slight adjustment if you go from the &#x27;3 circled&#x27; razors to the straight or vice versa).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing to the Braun 8595, the closeness-of-shave is equal....except I needed a few more strokes. Meaning, that the closeness was obtained in shorter &#x27;sweeps&#x27; on my face than the Braun 8595. However, at the end the result was the same and in some cases the CoolTec was slightly better. Firstly you should take this away from this paragraph: 1. Handheld razors (bladed non-electric) do not give as close as shave as my Braun 8595, and now also the Braun CoolTech 2. The Braun 8595, and now the CoolTech, shave **closer** than a handheld manual razor blade (not straight edge mind you). To beat the 8595 is to be as smooth as you think is smooth. Although the CoolTec does not &#x27;beat&#x27; it, it did, like I said above, slightly edge out (no pun intended) the 8595 in very few instances. Remember, though I had to use more shaving strokes to get there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can have a sense of relief that the CoolTec does, indeed, give a very close shave where I did not feel any grain when moving my hand up my face against it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the added &#x27;cool&#x27; feature the probability that I finally replace the 8595 is getting higher--which I never thought. However, with the fact that Braun has changed its &#x27;construction&#x27; of the replacement foil and cutter for the 8595, rendering it an inferior product to its original state, it looks like the CoolTec will be the choice for the closet shave I have experienced in any razor since the 8595.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[---Cool Feature---]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what this is? Neither did I. Here is a description:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you turn on the razor, after about 10-15 seconds the foil will get very cold. The temperature of the foil I would put at about 45-50 degrees Fahrenheit or around 7-10 Celsius. This feature is not a gimmick in that it has a purpose whereas other razors will be &#x27;less&#x27; than the CoolTec for the fact that they do not have this feature. The best possible use would be for the hairs on  your beard to be &#x27;fully&#x27; cold so that they stiffen up and stick out, however this is not really what the Cool feature does--proper time to do this would no be practical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the cool feature does is allow the razor to glide more smoothly over your skin and not &#x27;stick&#x27;. You know what this means especially if you ever tried to shave right after coming out of a hot shower. Your skin is softer and the razor grabs almost everything, including your skin (not to mention not shaving the wet hairs on your face). With the razor being able to more smoothly go over your skin, you will get less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I had to go over my face more times than with my 8595 (not too many), the addition of the cool feature will likely tip the balance for my personal usage to the CoolTec.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[---Precision---] 7/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the razor is precise enough, in general, to get most places of the face I do not like that the foils are separated as much as they are. Shaving the face and neck is fine, however getting the lip is awkward for me so that I am only using &#x27;1&#x27; foil as the entire razor face will not fit completely on my upper lip. The 8595&#x27;s foils were very close together so that the lip portion could be &#x27;gone over&#x27; with by both foil faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should mean to you that the razor is a bigger one--which it is. The head is fairly big. Not as precise as my 8595.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[---Construction---] 7/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mostly all plastic. Top-heavy (though not overall heavy). The looks are very good with the &#x27;black&#x27; presence all throughout the cleaning station and head. It looks like a man&#x27;s razor and looks fine for display. Also, because of the black, it does not show stray hairs on the equipment as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having tried other razors for under 100$ and even more expensive than the CoolTec, I can tell you that the CoolTec is one of the best out there and tied for the best I have used--with the 8595. The shave is close and the cool feature could be called almost a necessity. This will shave close than a manual razor blade (non straight edge) without the irritation--from which I experienced none. For a gift for a man (husband, pop, boyfriend, friend etc) that prefers not to let the &#x27;beard out&#x27;, you can feel safe knowing you will be getting him a razor that will input beard and output smooth.scription:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you turn on the razor, after about 10-15 seconds the foil will get very cold.

    <li> I am very angry.It&#x27;s not new . And the cleaning station don&#x27;t work!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;THE GREAT PRETENDER</li>
    <li> It does not do as good as my old Remington 280.I was wanting better</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with Braun shavers for more than 15 years. A few months ago I replaced my older razor with a new Series 7 ([[ASIN:B003YJAZZ4 Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Silver]]). This razor has a floating head (moves with the contours of your face) and the thinnest foil head Braun has ever used. It is the gold standard in electric shaving. This review, however, is not about that razor. I will use it for comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cool Tec razor has a unique feature: there is a metal strip between the cutting heads that is electronically cooled. According to Braun, this cooling will avoid razor burn and will provide a more comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;The metal strip gets cold. To me, the cooling makes me think that the razor is wet. It definitely produces a cooling sensation during shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears to be very well made. (My prior experience with Braun shavers included the shaver humming loudly, rattling, and the sideburn trimmer popping up and refusing to lock down). The Cool-Tec has a slide up trimmer on the back of the razor; nicely out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave quality: The shave is as close as it is with my Series 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;The shaving head is very wide and doesn&#x27;t swivel to adjust to my face countours. The system 7 shaver head is narrower, smoother, and follows my face as I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power cord can not be directly connected to the razor. In order to use the razor, it MUST be recharged. Charging can only be done in the cleaning system holder or in the (supplied) charging cradle. For those of us who travel and have experienced the razor running while in a suitcase (something presses the button), it is more than annoying to be unable to use the razor until an hour or more of charging can be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s heavy. This is a clunky unit. It weighs more and is bigger in all respects than the System 7. It makes it that much harder to maneuver the shaver around your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I haven&#x27;t had this razor long and I am unlikely to replace my System 7 with it, I can&#x27;t speak to how it will hold up in heavy use. I get the sense that this unit will be tough and hold up for many years. As you can see, I gave this razor four stars. It is excellent for what it is. I just can&#x27;t see any particular advantage in buying this unit for a \\&quot;cooler\\&quot; shave. For less than $10 more, you can have the wonderful (nearly perfect) Braun Series 7 shaving system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a lot of misinformation about the Braun shaving systems and maintaining them. I have been shaving with the Braun systems since they were first offered. The self-cleaning system is NOT a gimmick to get money from you to buy the cleaning solution. At one point that is what I thought, so I would dump the cartridge when it got the red, empty light and fill it with alcohol (the major ingredient in the Braun solution). I found myself going through shaving heads quickly (holes would develop). The reason: the official cleaning solution also contains a special oil that lubricates the blades. Without oil, heat builds up and the foil is damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CoolTec is better than I first thought. After a few weeks using it, the value of the cooling has become more apparent and I am a fan. The cutting head isn&#x27;t as smooth or flexible as the Series 7 razor, but it does a very good job and the cooling feels good. It&#x27;s worth a try.Since I haven&#x27;t had this razor long and I am unlikely to replace my System 7 with it, I can&#x27;t speak to how it will hold up in heavy use.

    <li> After spending the last few years doing the shaving cream and wet razor bit, I decided that I just simply don&#x27;t like shaving. I have pretty sensitive skin, and tend to end up with a red rash every time I shave. I thought I would give this razor a shot as it is a bit cheaper than the Series 5 and 7 models, and has the cooling feature. It is important to note that this basically IS the Series 3, just with a cooling bar added in between the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving: This razor does what it is designed to do. It shaves and does a good job at it. I actually don&#x27;t even have to go back and clean up with a wet razor. While I do have to turn it and make a few passes, I can shave my whole face and neck in about 4-5 minutes. The cooling system feels basically like dragging an ice cube across your face as you shave. The sensation is pretty weird, but using this razor doesn&#x27;t leave any rashes and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. So for sensitive skin, this Razor was a really good buy. I haven&#x27;t tried it without the CoolTec turned on, and while I imagine it would still shave well, it probably would give me similar results to my previous experiences. So, I&#x27;ll just continue using the CoolTec mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accessories/Cleaning: The razor cleans and maintains pretty easily. Just drop it in the cleaning system and hit the button. I do it every few shaves and not after each shave. In between I simply put the cap back on the solution and leave it sit next to the cleaning/charging base. It also comes with a travel case and travel charger, which while I haven&#x27;t used yet, seem reasonably small for traveling. I am a carry-on only person, and should be able to easily make enough space for the equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final thoughts: It&#x27;s a razor. It shaves well. The cooling features drastically reduce skin irritation. Overall, I am really pleased with my purchase of this razor, and hope that it holds up as long as Braun claims!</li>
    <li> The Braun CoolTec razor is likely to be under the Christmas tree in many households that have a gadget-loving partner that needs to shave, as the CoolTec bar really is pretty neat.  Unfortunately, the bottom line is that it&#x27;s not a particularly good razor.  3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, CoolTec throws in a bar - likely a Peltier cooler - that is supposed to make shaving with an electric razor less irritable to skin.  It does certainly provide a chill when shaving, and it&#x27;s a neat innovation.  However, veterans of electric shaving are unlikely to notice much difference, and there have always been a few alcohol based pre-shave products which work just as well to make shaving more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that the CoolTec bar is wide enough so that the two blades on the razor turn into  essentially single blade models, and this presents a major problem when going over the chin, jawbone, and mustache areas.  The third blade, the long hair clipper, is especially ineffective; I&#x27;d find long hairs I&#x27;d missed a day later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a neat toy and may get those who&#x27;ve avoided shaving with electric razors into that camp, but there are far better razors at this price point.  3 stars.</li>
    <li> I have my old Braun 8xxx series electric razor still, and I&#x27;ll be sticking with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CoolTec is a neat idea and really does get cold, but I still feel the need for aftershave.  So if the point is to lower skin irritation it really doesn&#x27;t do that very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also not a fan of the shave head.  I found that it left patches of slightly trimmed stubble as opposed to shaving my face like my old Braun does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re up for a mediocre shave and a cooling gimmick, this is likely the razor for you.  As for me, not so much.</li>
    <li> it is a gift for my friend.</li>
    <li> Braun CoolTec Men&#x27;s Shaving System&lt;br /&gt;This product is very good&lt;br /&gt;I like it very much&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it more</li>
    <li> All-around good product. Works like it says it will. Product is worth the price. It saves money in the long run.</li>
    <li> Product is innovative and serve its purpose well, price is excellent. However the manufacturer packaging was terrible, box looks worn and used, protection of item insufficient. And I thought this is the latest and newest shaver from Braun.....</li>
    <li> The CoolTec is a very effective razor at a reasonable price.  I have had difficulty finding an electric razor that meets my needs.  This one does the job.</li>
    <li> The Braun Cool Tec Men&#x27;s Shaving System is a great wet/dry electric shaver and accessory system. It equals, although I am not sure it really is better than, my prior gold standard for wet/dry shavers, my two older Panasonic models. In a way, the Braun Cool Tec confesses that these types of shavers, and the two leading brands, Braun and Panasonic, have sort of plateaued on real performance, and are resorting to frills and styling to differentiate their models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Cool Tec worked great for me and delivered fairly close, although not razor blade close, shaves in both wet and dry conditions. It&#x27;s easy to hold, and easy to hold on to, something important for a wet shaver where the user is likely gong to be wet also. It&#x27;s as good as my Panasonics, but I can&#x27;t really say I had a \\&quot;wow this is so much better\\&quot; moment. There are of course a wide range of beard types and users. I would rate myself \\&quot;average\\&quot;, so on the margins there may be some brillo beards out there who could find a distinct advantage for one system over another. For me, the two brands come up about equal. I actually kind of prefer the styling on the Braun models. In a head to head where the actual performance is so close, the styling may actually be a deal maker or breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the accessories in the Cool Tec system are well thought out and work pretty well. The combo cleaning/charging station is a good idea. But it remains to be seen how the cleaning part works over the long haul. It may in the end be just an opportunity to create an on going chance to keep buying the supplies to renew it. The one angle that I can&#x27;t get excited about is the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; feel \\&quot;active cooling\\&quot; gimmick, that supposes that what everyone has been waiting for is the feel of something cold on their skin while shaving. For me, not so much. I honestly can&#x27;t say that it contributed to the objective performance of the shaver, and I personally am not fond of cold on my face. And, it wasn&#x27;t all that \\&quot;cool\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, to recap, it is a really good shaver, but you should concentrate on the core functionality, and no so much on the tail fins and whiz bang accessories. All good, in the end, and I have been happy with my Braun Cool Tec and plan to keep on using it. RECOMMENDED.r /&gt;But, to recap, it is a really good shaver, but you should concentrate on the core functionality, and no so much on the tail fins and whiz bang accessories.

    <li> I started out using Braun electric shavers as a young adult and used them pretty much all through my early 20s.  I upgraded to newer models every few years, but the shave never really improved with each new model.  There were new features, like the cleaning system, but the shave wasn&#x27;t as good as a manual razor.  I stuck with it for the convenience of not having to use shaving cream or lotions.  I eventually gave up on electrics after dealing with skin irritation and in-grown hairs from using too much pressure in my attempt to get a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve pretty much been a manual razor guy for the past decade or so, but when I saw the new Braun CoolTec shaver, I was pretty excited to give it a try.  The CoolTec feature and the fact that it&#x27;s waterproof is very nice.  However, the shave is still just so-so and the cleaning system is still expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave myself about a month to get accustomed to using the Braun CoolTec.  I normally use a multi-blade manual razor with a non-foaming gel and some after shave lotion.  The very first time I used the CoolTec, it took me forever to finish shaving.  I usually only shave about once or twice a week, so there was some  significant growth, but the CoolTec did not do a great job of picking up hair growing in different directions.  On the plus side, I really like the CoolTec feature and I did eventually get a little faster with my shave.  I also tried shaving in the shower, but without a fog-less mirror, I missed a ton of spots and looked ridiculous afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the CoolTec is wonderful because it&#x27;s waterproof.  You can use the small brush to wipe under the cutter, then rinse the whole thing under the faucet.  When I ran out of juice and needed to charge it, that&#x27;s when I used the cleaning station with the alcohol-based cleaning solution.  I like how clean the shaver feels after a cleaning, but it&#x27;s an expensive consumable that needs replacing every couple of months.  Personally, I&#x27;d stick to just rinsing the shaver under hot water after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is probably the nicest Braun electric I&#x27;ve used and being waterproof is a big plus for cleaning purposes.  The CoolTec feature is really nice as well.  However, the shave is just average and inefficient to boot.  If it was either the closest shave I could get or extremely efficient, it might be worth using.  But being that it&#x27;s neither, I&#x27;m going back to my manual razor.o just rinsing the shaver under hot water after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is probably the nicest Braun electric I&#x27;ve used and being waterproof is a big plus for cleaning purposes.

    <li> I have tried it for weeks now and it just cannot give a close shave at all, it does not even cut the hair really.  My 7-year old electric razor was so much better and actually shaved!  Going to try and contact Braun for a replacement or a credit.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to purchase the cool tec shaver,the cooling feature is refreshing and feels especially nice.Well done Braun!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Best shave ever&amp;#34;- Hubby :-)</li>
    <li> Just what i expected from a Braun shaver.</li>
