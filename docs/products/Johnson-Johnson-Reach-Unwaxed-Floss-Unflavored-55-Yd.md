    <li> Used for kitten delivery :-) Needed unwaxed unflavored....</li>
    <li> I love this floss  - and Amazon was quick to deliver.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find unwaxed floss. I feel as if the waxed just slides off my teeth without cleaning....not so with unwaxed floss!</li>
    <li> Why is it SO hard to find unwaxed, unflavored floss?? This is perfect, no complaints - wish they carried it in stores. Thank you, Amazon!</li>
    <li> Drug stores don&#x27;t carry unwaxed floss anymore so it&#x27;s off to Amazon I go. This a great product that doesn&#x27;t shred.</li>
    <li> My friend was complaining that he could not find unwaxed floss anymore at any of the drug stores in our area. I said I bet Amazon has it and yep they do.  He is so happy with this brand too.</li>
    <li> terrific product, wish more local stores carried it. Waxed products don&#x27;t do it for me. Wish more stores carried the un-waxed floss.</li>
    <li> It was only one 100 yd pack</li>
    <li> Bought this fot my husband and he said that it shreds. He said he could not even use it. Not worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> CVS brand of this unwaxed and un-flavored floss is my favorite, but this performs well too.  That waxed stuff does not clean well, if at all.  And the mint in some floss irritates my gums.  I like this thin, filament type floss.  You can feel it raking the plaque off.</li>
    <li> Unwaxed dental floss is almost always hard to find in the grocery or drug stores.  I&#x27;m so glad that I found this site.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this floss for everyone first. The only situation where this floss would not be good is when you have really tight contacts between the teeth. If you do, then you will need to get waxed floss. Though, waxed floss does a horrible job of cleaning.    We need to step back and review why we floss. The number one reason is to remove the dental black below the gumline in order to prevent gum disease. The secondary reason is to remove plaque at the contact point of the teeth. Since gum disease awareness is becoming more common, I suggest using this floss as your first and only floss.    Flossing is not easy to do. That&#x27;s why I have created videos on how to floss. Dentists and dental hygienists don&#x27;t stress it enough frankly because they don&#x27;t get paid to educate. Profit margins for dentists are so low it doesn&#x27;t make a lot of business sense to spend lots of time teaching people how to floss.    If you do floss, cutting your gums, bleeding, or \\&quot;not getting it through\\&quot; are not good reasons to not do it. Floss with unwaxed floss because it simply cleans better. Floss more often then the gums won&#x27;t bleed. They bleed because you don&#x27;t floss. If you cut your gums or can&#x27;t get it through, try changing your technique. Do you use your middle fingers to floss? If not, you should. Do you use a \\&quot;sawing\\&quot; motion to get floss between your teeth? You should.    Don&#x27;t look at the floss as the problem, look at your technique first.    Flossing with unwaxed floss is great because it DOES shred. You want the \\&quot;roughness\\&quot; to \\&quot;grab\\&quot; the dental plaque. Waxed floss just doesn&#x27;t cut it.    I hardly use waxed floss in the office and I don&#x27;t use it in my mouth.    Other thing to note: gum disease is not common in kids teeth. That&#x27;s just the way it is. So if you really need to remove plaque and food between your kids teeth, then go ahead and use floss. Otherwise, spend the time brushing longer with fluoride toothpaste.    Dr. Marvin</li>
    <li> Great product but no one seems to carry it in the stores any more.  The unwaxed fibers really&lt;br /&gt;clean your teeth and, com on now, do you really need an artificial flavor to floss!</li>
    <li> It does a better job than waxed floss. Can&#x27;t find this in drug stores and the 99 Cent Store stopped carrying it. I think its too pricey on Amazon, but if you want something that does the job you need, you get it. Disappointed that I had to pay shipping fee for each of the 3 I ordered, though they were packed together. Is that a rip, or is this the way it is on Amazon, that you pay shipping for each item even though they&#x27;re packed together?</li>
    <li> Great for first aid kit</li>
    <li> As a daughter of a dentist...I only used non-waxed floss....Keeps your mouth clean and fresh and really works.  Keeps my gums light pink and very healthy.</li>
    <li> Recommended by our dentist, but unable to find in a local store.</li>
    <li> All other dental flosses break too easily or are too slippery.  It&#x27;s getting harder to find this one on drugstore shelves as well, so ti&#x27;s nice to see it here.</li>
    <li> Great product! I like unwaxed floss a lot better than wax because I feel like it cleans better, but if you have sensitive gums it might be a little harsh for you. Ships fast!</li>
    <li> Best way to insure that buttons stay put.</li>
    <li> Just needed this to clean my embroidery machine.  Did a great job.</li>
