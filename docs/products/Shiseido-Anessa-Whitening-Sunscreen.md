    <li> I like this product.It&#x27;s very good for my skin.The seller is very kind. I will continue use it. I want to become whiter and whiter......lol</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for couple years and I like it a lot. It&#x27;s light and non-sticky.</li>
    <li> Like it a lot! Great Product!</li>
    <li> I love the formula and texture of this sunblock! It definitely goes on transparent and does not leave me looking pasty and chalky. The skin lightening benefits is a plus for me who want to maintain light skin during summer. I&#x27;m ordering some more.</li>
    <li> I love this sunblock, I will use it all my life!!!</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t begun to use, it&#x27;s good to look at is the real thing.</li>
    <li> Brighten my skin and not feel oil. My biggest concern with sunscreen is blocking my pores. With this product, every pores on my face can breath and it feels so comfortable!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not too oily.. i love it</li>
    <li> The product is way too expensive.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen ! It&#x27;s not too dry or oily.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for my skin. I&#x27;ll purchase again for sure.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen ever! not heavy or oily at all! Muuuuuuuch better than the American version shiseido sunscreen that sephora is selling.&lt;br /&gt;I have the SPF50 one and this one; they are both very good.Definitely will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;And the seller is very nice. There was a handwriting letter came with the package, and a little cute snack AS A PRESENT FROM SELLER&#x27;S CHILD! And the seller drew two smiling faces on the letter, which I guess are her child and herself. SO SWEET. Happiest purchase ever.</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen. Easy to apply, no scent, no white streaks, no eye-irritating chemicals.</li>
    <li> I use this almost everyday, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like other sunscreens sunblocks i&#x27;ve used. it also makes your skin appear lighter colored, so I use it as my foundation. I put on this sunscreen, wait 5~10 minutes then I would apply some powder foundation.</li>
    <li> the item is not the one as description and show in the picture...</li>
    <li> The seller should probably make a correction of the description of this product. The one I received is the latest version, which is spf 50+, PA++++. AND I LOVE IT! gonna buy again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what happen to this product. I ordered this SPF32 and they arrived as SPF50.&lt;br /&gt;It is white bottle in a plastic bag cover. Totally not what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;And the label they stick on the plastic cover says SPF32....</li>
    <li> i received a new version one which is SPF50+</li>
    <li> This sunscreen offers great everyday protection and has helped lighten my acne scars as well as prevent new ones from forming. My skin tone doesn&#x27;t magically look completely even, but it&#x27;s a noticeable enough change for me to buy another bottle. Also, the texture is amazing compared to most sunscreens available in the US. It&#x27;s lightweight and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> Product is good. But shipping takes awhile, I think it was because it&#x27;s imported from Japan. Overall is good for me.</li>
    <li> not as good as i expect, don&#x27;t buy</li>
