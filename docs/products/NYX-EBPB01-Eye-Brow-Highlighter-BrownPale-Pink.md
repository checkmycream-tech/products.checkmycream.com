<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> rarely use pink side, the brown does fade after 6 or 7 hours. Looks natural after I blend it. Good for filling in light brows.</li>
    <li> Never knew what I was missing until I purchased this eyebrow pencil! Love it!!</li>
    <li> The brown is really pale though. If you need to fill in darker brows, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one, this should be more for blonde to medium brow tones.</li>
    <li> This is a very handy little item; I like that it is compact and dual purposed.  The brow color is spot on, and does not look artificial.  The highlighter can be used as a cover, too, for imperfections in the brow area.  I take it everywhere I go!</li>
    <li> my eyebrows are a taupe ish color. i use nyx taupe/ash eyebrow powder, which i love but my eyebrows arent sharp or cleaning looking, and i love eyebrow pencils. i&#x27;ve bought about 10 shades and nothing worked.and i just LOVE this. fits well, ill put up before and after pics. i love it.&lt;br /&gt;the highlighter is just okay, but if you like a natural look, this brow pencil would be go to. brighten up your inner corner and under eyes. and have good eyebrows in just one product.</li>
    <li> This works perfectly just as many of the other reviews claim! Fills in those bald spots and you&#x27;d never know a product was used</li>
    <li> The brown is not dark enough but the highlighter part works nicely.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I tried this. I usually use Anasthasia routine. I love this pencil. The brown side goes on light and you can build up the color. The pink highlighter really does \\&quot;lift\\&quot; your eyebrow. I finish it off with the wax stick.</li>
    <li> The brow pencil portion of this is both too light for darker brows (I am Indian, so a dark brown usually works well for me), and slightly too waxy to apply well. It takes a bit too much effort to get a good amount of color on, and you definitely need a spoolie to brush out your brows after using this to reduce the flattening effect of the waxiness. The highlighter, honestly, is kind of silly, and I never use it. The NYX Eyebrow Cake Powder is definitely superior.</li>
    <li> This item works well except when you try to sharpen the highlighter side it somewhat falls apart and it becomes difficult to use it.</li>
    <li> This is my HG eyebrow product! The brown side is the perfect shade for my light brown brows And it doesn&#x27;t look fake or harsh. The pink side is creamy but not shimmery and melts right into my skin. It really does brighten up the entire eye area without being obvious. Since it is not a shimmery highlighter, it looks very discreet and I&#x27;ve had people trying to guess what&#x27;s \\&quot;different\\&quot; about me lately. It really seems to lift the brows (but doesn&#x27;t make you look like you&#x27;re perpetually surprised) and opens up the face beautifully. Try it! It&#x27;s amazing, I&#x27;ll never purchase another brow product again!</li>
    <li> I have medium to light reddish auburn hair. Would have preferred it to be a tad lighter, but it&#x27;s a wonderful product.  The highlighter end does a remarkable job of defining the under brow and inner eye area.</li>
    <li> Seriously-5 big stars! For people who don&#x27;t know what color to buy or who are afraid of looking like you are overly made up.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if this item even works because when I recieved it it in the mail the packaging had been cut open. The light side looked brand new but the brown side has very clearly been used. I&#x27;m so frustrated I doubt I will even order this again. I guess I will look elsewhere for one.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t say it was a brow miracle but definitely  one of my favs. Pink end slightly cakey needs a brush to smooth out.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my blonde brows, only downside is the fact you need a really big sharpener too.</li>
    <li> I can not say enough about this product, it is an all in one Eye Brow pencil.  I love the pink side, you can use just as much as you like, it gives a great hint of color for right under the eye brow.</li>
    <li> Loved the product but CANNOT sharpen it with a eye pencil sharpener.  I have tried going at it with a sharp knife but the tip is ragged and pathetic.  Hate to keep buying this product when I KNOW that it will soon be virtually unusable because the composite wood is too dense to be sharpened.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite brow pencil ever.  It really does match your shade and fill in brows perfectly, plus the highlighter which can be used all over, not just on your brows.  Really great product!</li>
    <li> The pencil is easy to use, the color is a little too light for me, and it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; very easy...at least with my experience..So I am still using my normal brow pencil, but the reason I really bought this was for the highlighter which is amazing. Perfect color, and lasts all day. I love it!</li>
    <li> The brown color has a weird shimmer to it.  It almost looks like I put some type of shimmer dust on my eyebrows. Everyone is always raving about this but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I every lived without this product before. On the days when I don&#x27;t have time to put on makeup, I just use this, mascara and a chapstick and/or lipgloss and done! It immediately makes you look put together and less tired.</li>
    <li> I had higher expectations for this product. The brown color is very light until it barely shows:(. Im a medium brown and it doesnt work for me. But my daughter luvs to play makeup with the highlighter part.</li>
    <li> Love love love! I am 41 years old and I have an addiction to cosmetics. This is one of my favorite products! It makes such a difference in the look of your eyebrow and changes the whole shape of your face. My hair is brown with blonde highlights and it goes very well. I didn&#x27;t know if I would like it, but was literally amazed at how it instantly lifts the look of the eye and youth end your whole appearance. This is an excellent product. I have tried all of the high end cosmetics and would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> I like the Pale Pink Highlighter cause its good for giving your brow bone that pop. But the Brown pencil is not my favorite so I don&#x27;t use it much.</li>
    <li> This is a great little product! It does what it says. The color is so neutral that almost anyone can use it and I love the highlighter end for highlighting the brow bone, and the inner corners of my eyes. Great product, will order again!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to think when I bought this, but I see such a difference in my whole appearance when I use it. I LOVE it. I&#x27;m in my forties and this really helps \\&quot;lift\\&quot; the brow without using the services of your friendly neighborhood cosmetic surgeon.</li>
    <li> EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THIS! The only con is it&#x27;s hard to sharpen because it&#x27;s so thick!</li>
    <li> Was a little greasy under cap, I&#x27;m assuming from shipping in the heat, but after cleaning,  it works great and as described.</li>
    <li> I usually use powder to fill in my brows, but decided to amp up my make up collection. I ordered this just to try something different, and now my brows have never looked better. I use this to accentuate the arch, and use my angled brow brush to push it up and back. I still use my powder, which clings to the pencil and gives it staying power. the highlighter is a God sent. I draw it on under my brow, and use my brush to blend it in. I would buy this again. Look up some tutorials on YouTube to see how to get the perfect brow.</li>
    <li> The colors are nice, but... It seemed like I was having to push hard to apply the brown. Not necessary. The high light color is nice, it goes on thick at first until you blend, then it&#x27;s pretty. I found something else to replace this product.</li>
    <li> This is the first NYX product I&#x27;ve ever bought and I&#x27;m impressed.  Easy application, good price, nice color, blends easily.  (I love the colors and my complexion is fair and I have dark brown hair.)</li>
    <li> I use the highlighter under my brows and it gives them definition and left.  Pencil end is a little dark for me so I use it sparingly.</li>
    <li> The brown part of the pencil makes my eyebrows look weird. They look as if I had used a shiny light color.  I just use the clear side to define my eyebrows better.</li>
    <li> This product works so well! I love the way the pencil blends with my natural eyebrow hair. The highlighter definitely helps define your eyebrow shape. A great buy!</li>
    <li> Never used a product quite like this before I can say that I will get this again.  Love the way it comes with tips and tricks as to how to use it.  I also love the way you can use the highlighter for multiple uses.  For those on the go its a must have.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite eyebrow product! Love it and don&#x27;t go without it when applying my makeup!</li>
    <li> Very handy little item. Works well, not expensive.  Why not?</li>
    <li> Highlights and defines as promised!</li>
    <li> I love this brow pencil. It is quicker to apply this than it is my MAC eyebrow pencil because the tip is thicker. The brown color is very natural and even suits my blonde hair well (though it probably would be too dark for very light blonde hair). The pink end is amazing. It really defines my brows and brightens up my eyes, making them look bigger. And you cannot beat the price!</li>
    <li> This product is pretty good.  I am a redhead, and I would prefer a lighter shade, which was not available.  My eyebrows really need help, and this does help, but it is a bit too dark for me.  I would highly recommend this for someone with darker hair.  I do like this product.</li>
    <li> I CHOSE TO RATE THIS A 3 star brow pencil since it is way dark. And the wax side made my brows look like I was trying to hard. But thank you for being so prompt and everything else was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Wendi</li>
    <li> The brow pencil blends easily and looks very natural. I love the highlighter end! It is great to use in the corner of the eyes to make you look well rested and to use under the brow.</li>
    <li> great as usual. it is exactly what i expected. i would definetely buy it again. i recommend it. buy it</li>
    <li> I love this so much. It&#x27;s cheap and it works wonders, better than other brow products I&#x27;ve tried; i have fair skin and dirty blonde/light brunette hair so this is the perfect, buildable ash brown shade for me. It&#x27;s a bit of a pain to sharpen, but it fits in UD&#x27;s Grindhouse. It lasts for at very least six months with daily use, and is easily correctable but will say on all day, especially with a setting spray.</li>
    <li> The pink color is prettyyyyyyyyy!</li>
    <li> This is my second one of these. Love this pencil and couldn&#x27;t live without it!  Used my other one done to the ends. The ash brown matches almost all hair color shades. And I use the highlights around my eyes on the stupid Monday mornings! Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Product was a was of my money. I don&#x27;t know who would it would work for. I threw it away. Color site was too dark for brown ( not easy to apply and  pink side was ash.</li>
    <li> NYX Eye Brow Push-Up Bra, is very good. And the color is fantastic. Loved it! is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> My favorite eyebrow pencil ! I Love that the color isn&#x27;t too dark or too light , blends in great.</li>
    <li> The brown end is a typical eyebrow pencil but does seem to go on a little better than some and lasts pretty well for a pencil but the best part of this is the pink side. It really is great to highlight and &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; the appearance of  the eye. I even put it in the corners of my eyes to really pop. Amazing product!</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this item.  I have convinced so many of my friends to ditch the pricey eyebrow pencils and highlighters and switch over to this two-in-one double ended pencil.  Here are the reasons it beats anything else out there.&lt;br /&gt;1.  The eyebrow pencil is a medium-dark brown color and goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t look too made up.  It makes your eyebrows look naturally thick and shaped.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The highlighter is user-friendly.  These products use to intimidate me, I know nothing about contouring the face with makeup and highlighting features but this pencil is a beautiful shade and is so easy to apply under the eyebrow bone and over it.&lt;br /&gt;3.  With combined use of each feature eyebrows look noticeably different, even if you haven&#x27;t groomed your brows for a while, the push up brow pencil gives them a clean and attractive look.&lt;br /&gt;4.  It&#x27;s so compact and easy to carry around&lt;br /&gt;5.  HELLO ITS 10 dollars!!!</li>
    <li> I used this product in a different way...give my eyes a refresh look.</li>
    <li> Love it! Definitely will buy another one.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the color was too light.  I really don&#x27;t like the wax.</li>
    <li> Love it. It performed as expected.</li>
    <li> i love this eyebrow pencil ❤️ worth the price makes my eyebrows perfect,will buy again</li>
    <li> The brown has a glitter not what I was looking for, but love the highlight. Can&#x27;t sharpen now, the size is not universal must buy it separately :( not recommended</li>
    <li> Worked perfect for my eyebrows.  I am type 3 neutral skin type with dark hair (some gray that still dyes well) and medium to dark eyebrows that are getting thinner with age.  This pencil worked perfectly for me.  It is a little pricey for an eyebrow pencil but works well.  I don&#x27;t normally wear full makeup on a daily basis so this should last a long time if used only for a night out or special occasions. It would be nice if it came with a sharpener that fit this pencil.  Makes it even pricier if you have to buy a special sharpener for just one pencil instead of being able to use generic sharpeners that most of us already have.</li>
    <li> Neutral color works nicely and has good staying power even on a hot day. I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> The push up part of this pencil is awesome... The pencil part, not so much. But all in all, a great product</li>
    <li> I am using my husband account. This is not at all what I expected. I like the highlighter side very well. The pencil side I don&#x27;t care for it. It don&#x27;t go on well because it is not very pigmented at all.</li>
    <li> The brown end of it has some weird shimmer to it and the highlighter side is very opaque and brings no light the finished makeup. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Love it! Fills in my eyebrows, makes them look like there full and thick. Will recommend this to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I bought the pencil for the pink tip, which works perfectly fine, soft and comfortable for defining your eyebrows, for that reason alone I would not give 1 star.  The brown tip, however, is HARD HARD HARD like a rock even on my hand. It has no color, if try to use on my face I would risk cutting my eyebrows!!</li>
    <li> The light side is great and does a nice job highlighting but the brown side hardly has any color to it.</li>
    <li> Product is great, EXCEPT, went dull very fast and I don&#x27;t have an XL pencil sharpener. Either make the pencil smaller or give a sharpener with the product as so many other companies are offering these days!</li>
    <li> Love the brow highlighter part, but the brown pencil was really hard to work with. I don&#x27;t know if the one I have is particularly dried out, but even after sharpening it, it just doesn&#x27;t want to transfer onto skin, no matter how hard I pushed.  The pink half of the pencil is great though. I have a similar product, I think by Benefit, that was like $35 and this NYX version is just as nice, and I think it&#x27;s even more blendable and I like the color a little better. I wish NYX did a whole pencil with just the highlighter. For filling, I really like NYX&#x27;s brow powder kit with the two powders and the little wax tub with the two applicators. I feel like the powders give you more control and look more natural than pencil anyway.</li>
    <li> its good but i ordered a wrong shade and it would be hard to return it. would probably give it out.</li>
    <li> Love this!! Purchase more frequently from CVS.</li>
    <li> This is the thing every woman needs.  Works perfect!</li>
    <li> This brow /eye pencil is amazing! It somehow blended with my brows perfectly! The light pinkish whitish end really did lift my brow line, it&#x27;s also great for inner eye corners, and lining lower lids. I&#x27;m buying this product forever, it&#x27;s a staple now!</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite makeup! I am obsessed with everything eyebrows because i have sparse thin brows, so i have tried many. I like this one particularly because it have a highlighter on it. Its pinkish but matte, which i love cause i hate that shimmery white highlighter look. Its a must have for eyebrow girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;I originally gave this product five stars, but after using it, it has become difficult. It is too big and bulky, its hard to pencil in my thin eyebrows with such a huge tip. My NYX pencil sharpener broke and i used another one on it, it totally messed up the pencil. It wont sharpen correctly in the big hole which is ridiculous. It is just too big and clunky for my eyebrows.It is now sitting in my draw with the other forgotten makeup that i had great expectations for.</li>
    <li> this is a very decent eyebrow filler. It isn&#x27;t spectacular but it is the best I&#x27;ve found so far. The color works well for brown/taupe eyebrows. There is no orange in it.</li>
    <li> I love makeup and this really makes a great pair.  The pink highlighter looks great. Go for on the go.</li>
    <li> Works great and is a great color for dark blonde brows. Reasonable price :-)</li>
    <li> Short version: Get this brow pencil/ highlighter duo! Your sad looking eyebrows will thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long version: I have dark reddish-brown hair, but my eyebrows are bizarrely light brown to almost blonde! I also have several hairs that are missing from a few tweezing mishaps. Anyway, I have been using brow pencil for a long time, but it never looked that amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually stumbled upon this, because I do like to use a highlighter right under my brow, but couldn&#x27;t find one in pencil form that I liked. This is really awesome because it combines those two needs into one terrific package! Here&#x27;s why it&#x27;s amazing... (cue rolling out long list sound)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) The shade really does match most skin types. As another reviewer mentioned, there are no orange tones as to look like an unnatural color. This is important, because you don&#x27;t want people to actually tell that you are coloring in your shameful eyebrows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) The pencil is much firmer than a typical brow pencil. At first, I was surprised at home much pressure I had to use to apply this, but after trying it a few times, I really liked the look it gave. As an art teacher, I am always teaching students how to draw the human eye. We always use a finely sharpened pencil to create those fine lines on the eyelashes and eyebrows. This pencil makes it possible to actually draw realistic looking hairs if you want to! If you&#x27;re in a rush, you can always smudge a little and give the idea that you actually have an eyebrow!! Either way, firm is the way to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) Another plus of the firmness, is that you actually end up using less than the softer pencils. I was sharpening my old brow pencil so often, and this one keeps a nice point for a long time. Yes, you can sharpen it! You just need the right sharpener... again as an art teacher, I have access to a random assortment of tools to use for makeup!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.) Lastly, the highlighter is just exactly what I was looking for! The box states several ways this can be used as a highlighter- 2 of which I normally used already. I like to highlight the inside corner of the eye as well as right below the brow line to give that extra \\&quot;push-up\\&quot; as they like to call it! They also suggest using it as a concealer.. hmm! Might try it! and also as a cheek bone highlighter. I tried that this morning and it did work well! So versatile!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, as you can tell, I am happy with this purchase and will definitely be recommending it to my make-up loving friends and family!!!x states several ways this can be used as a highlighter- 2 of which I normally used already.

    <li> I love this product, the brow pencil is the perfect shade and the high light is great. It is great to shape your eyebrows  and make them pop.</li>
    <li> Great to make eyebrows appear thicker and more defined, recommend use for people with medium to dark brown hair so it looks natural.</li>
    <li> I love EVERY NYX product and this works awesome!! The only reason it isn&#x27;t 4 stars is because the brow liner was a bit to light for my color eyebrows..</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this liner at first it seemed really light in color. After the first use I fell in love! The pencil goes on super smooth and it&#x27;s easy to line and full in your brow. The color is light but after going over the brow several times it darkens. The highlighter part is great for highlighting especially near the eyes or under the brow. Great quality.  This is my new favorite brow pencil.</li>
    <li> This brow and highlighter stick does just what it says. You can definitely notice the difference if you use the highlighter on one eye and leave the other plain. I will absolutely order it again. The price was very reasonable as well.</li>
    <li> I really like  this Eye brow.  This is the second one I&#x27;m buying. . This color looks really natural, and it is easy to use for my everyday rush.  I only wish they sell the dark brown color only, so I can have more of it.  I still have the pale pink highlighter and I have to buy it again, because I run out of the dark brown one.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of the eyebrow pencil... But I love the highlighter end!</li>
    <li> The brown end is too waxy and does not apply smoothly. I was disappointed with that, but I like the highlighter end to rim my inside bottom lid.</li>
    <li> I kept the box for a while to use the simple diagram on the side till I was sure I could remember how to use this.  It really does work.  I was surprised that the lighter end was pink instead of cream or white, it blends well and gives good coverage.  The dark is nice and natural.  They blend easily and are not greasy.  I don;t usually like products that are in wood and need to be sharpened - but this is very nice. The pencils are soft enough - but not too soft. They hold well and do not smear.</li>
    <li> the eyebrow pencil end is really good, the taupe blends well with my brow but I find that the pale pink highlighter does not blend well and looks cakey on me</li>
    <li> I bought this seeing all the reviews on here and was a bit disappointed. It did not highlight at all. in fact it seemed to show NO noticeable color on my brow bones, under eyes and inner eyes. I was bummed since being so excited to try it.&lt;br /&gt;I use a white very light shimmer powder to highlight instead and It looks like I will be sticking to that. The brown totally matched my eyebrows but it did not work too well, in that I had to press hard over and over to get it to work on my brows.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps my skin is too evenly pigment matched to the pink highlighter since I have fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;Was not worth the price. I had bought it on Amazon with a large order of other items but it was not in the order so I went out and bought it since I would have to wait so long to have them ship it. They were great about refunding the money so perhaps the one I bought was too old and had sat on the shelf too long. I don&#x27;t know but Sadly it did not work on me.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> The dark color is a bit too faint on for my coloring, but the pink is a great hi lighter and even a good concealer.  I am glad that I tried this pencil</li>
    <li> Best money I have ever spend!</li>
    <li> Works as expected, makes my eyebrows look wonderful!</li>
    <li> I really like it! I just kind of wish the brown was a little bit creamier. But its a good color for all types of brows</li>
    <li> I just love this pencil so much!!!! the quality is great, the highlighter is amazing! The best one I&#x27;ve had so far. Is definitely a keeper! Will keep buying in the future</li>
    <li> Love it love it it matches my eyebrow color not to dark it looks natural highlighter is also wonderful I used it everyday stays on all day without a brow gel</li>
    <li> Love it saved me more than once especially if I&#x27;m on a hurry amazing</li>
    <li> I have fine black hair, and my brows are very sparse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in sunny San Diego where I prefer naturally filled-in brows that look strikingly CASUAL.  Since I wear very natural looking make-up, I needed natural brows.  This product is perfect for that.  You can use a heavy hand and it fills in like a medium pigmented wax.  I don&#x27;t feel overdone.  My brows are filled in nicely and the wax component in the pencil keeps the hairs contained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the other end for the corners of my eyes and to line the bottom of the brow to give it definition (blend it out of course to look more natural).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was NOT looking for a product that was heavily pigmented which I would feel more comfortable using for night time with full eye make-up.  Those products you have to use a light hand, whereas this one, you don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a Dual Revlon pencil sharpener that works incredibly well with this size and a regular pencil.  Love this product, bought an extra for back up.</li>
    <li> Im in love with this pencil its great for the brows love the wax part its perfect I will buy it again</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it says it does. Happy with product.Will be telling my friends about it. Wow it brightens your eyes.</li>
    <li> Purchased this a few weeks ago and I just purchased another one for back up. I love this! The color is perfect and blends so well with my brows. Looks so natural. Love Love LOVE this product. I&#x27;ve used it on my mom and sister and they fell in love with it too and now they&#x27;re buying one as well.</li>
    <li> The quality is poor, which I&#x27;m surprised based off of so many positive reviews. After just a few days of use on both ends, the inside part of the pencil on both sides sucked into the wood so I couldn&#x27;t even use it (and I don&#x27;t mean it was worn down from being used to the point of needing to be sharpened). I haven&#x27;t purchased a sharpener for this size, yet, but debating if it&#x27;s even worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the eight bucks I spent on this pencil.</li>
    <li> This color is a beautiful color.  I don&#x27;t use the highlighter as much as the brown, so I expect I will run out of brown first.  But I&#x27;ve had the pencil for months, and only sharpened it twice.  It will last a very long time at this rate so I am very happy.  I am dark blonde with medium eyebrows.  LOVE the color!!</li>
    <li> I really like the pink color end. it shades and blends well. Makes you eye look open and fresh. I put some below my eyes to hide darkness also.</li>
    <li> I am going to stick with my nicer pencils i don&#x27;t care i they cost more they will be worth it. I don&#x27;t care for the texture of either side and feel they don&#x27;t do anything for me</li>
    <li> I ordered the NYX Eye Brow Push-Up Bra, Lift and Draw Pencil. The item was suppose to be in stock, so I ordered the sharpener also. I have the sharpener, but no pencil. I was told the pencil was not in stock and it was on back order. A couple days ago I received a call saying they did not know when they would receive the pencil!</li>
    <li> I so wanted to like this pencil. I had read the reviews that it&#x27;s really hard to sharpen but thought &amp;#34;that&#x27;s just them&amp;#34;. I love the pink color; the brown is a little light but okay. I used it for about 10 days then this morning I went to sharpen it - oh boy. The wood part of the pencil splintered and came off in big chunks that ruined the tip and made the pencil impossible to use so I had to throw it away. $10 bucks down the drain. And, I owe an apology to all the other reviewers who tried to warn me but I didn&#x27;t listen! Sorry!</li>
    <li> The light-brown pencil is exactly the right shade for my brows, but it is so dry that it doesn&#x27;t even stick to my skin.  Even with repeated sharpening it skips and doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly during application.  It also crumbles during sharpening WITH the NYX sharpener.  I have to say that the highlighter is completely awesome, though!  Nice and smooth, it goes exactly where you put it and can be used as concealer or highlighter elsewhere on your face (I love it on the tops of my cheekbones; it &amp;#34;wakes up&amp;#34; my whole look).  Blends perfectly.  I buy this product just for the highlighter, actually!</li>
    <li> My eyebrows are a very light color and sparse. Additionally, when I was 16 I lopped off the end of one brow in an ill-advised wax attempt. It never grew back fully so one brow is especially sparse. I read good things about this product and ordered it despite feeling skepticism that one color could work for everyone. I&#x27;m pleased to say my skepticism has been replaced with product love. I have actual, realistic eyebrows. I even like the highlighter. I don&#x27;t go crazy with it and blend it in so it&#x27;s not a noticeable line. My only real complaint is it doesn&#x27;t sharpen with the Trish McEvoy sharpener that has a side for eyeliner and a side for fatter pencils. Since the original point wore down I&#x27;ve yet to be able to get a good sharp point but that probably works in my favor as I think smudged lines result in a more realistic-looking brow.</li>
    <li> Love this! It&#x27;s a pain to sharpen, but it&#x27;s worth the effort.</li>
    <li> I am an esthetician and love to use this on my own brows as well as my clients.  Highlighter looks a little weird on darker skin.  However the brown side can work on blonde to very dark brown depending on how much pressure you use.  Easy to sharpen.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but I don&#x27;t like the shimmer in it. It feels waxy, and the concealer/highlight end goes on a little clumpy. That said, both ends do last all day without smudges. Just wasn&#x27;t as precision as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
    <li> its a little rough to put on. I do like it but not love it.&lt;br /&gt;i will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Actually this little trick does work if you have time for such things. Great little idea.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product !  Definitely gives the look of a lifted brow and glides on smooth.</li>
    <li> I was very excited for this pencil. Unfortunately it left me wanting. It was very greasy instead of waxy, and smeared very easily - not in a good smudgy way.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be sticking to my more expensive Anastasia eyebrow gear from now on.</li>
    <li> I too can not get the thing to sharpen. I&#x27;ve whittled it down to nothing trying every eye liner sharpener I own. Makes me sad because I love the product except for that</li>
    <li> Works just as great as the pricy brand.  Same exact thingI got from Sephora, but half the price.  Winning!!</li>
    <li> It has glitter in it.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of this pencil but it&#x27;s a little difficult to get an even coat on my brows.</li>
    <li> Not too bad, gets the job done. The only complaint I have is that it is slightly bigger then your average makeup pencil, so sharpening it can be difficult. I have several sharpeners, and this item was too big to use in the ones I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other then that the product works great. I find that the eyebrow end is a little greasy.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Too expensive. Unable to return it. Waste of money. Too expensive. Unable to return it. Do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> My eyebrows are almost white like my hair.  I ordered this eyebrow product hoping to enhance my brows slightly.  The brown is a bit too red, the highliter is waxy but works to hold down the hairs.  I don&#x27;t use it to highlight.  But I believe that both pencils would be very difficult to sharpen when the tip wears down.  I wish eyebrow colors would be made in some grayish browns.  Vibrant colors don&#x27;t work for those of us with gray or white hair.</li>
    <li> would like if the brown side was easier to apply, have to apply multiple layers on to my brows to fill them in.  the pink side works great though.</li>
    <li> I dont know who has grey eyebrows...it was suppose to be brown. But the highlighter is great.</li>
    <li> Best eyebrow pencil ever. I&#x27;ll never be without this in my bag. In 50+ years I&#x27;ve never bothered with filling in my brows. Gave this product a try. Amazing difference! Looks natural, highlighter is nice too. Lasts all day. I use baby oil to remove eye makeup. Works perfectly and moisturizes too. This brow pencil comes off cleanly and without scrubbing. Love it!</li>
    <li> I got this same product at my local dollar tree for one doller and it wasn&#x27;t really all that great.</li>
    <li> this pencil and the colors work much better than the white and dark brown individual pencils i had before. the are smooth and easy to blend. bright colors but also natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i wish i had payed attention to the fact it was jumbo sized. why doesn&#x27;t it say so?! Ill have to buy a new sharpener, and hopefully it sharpens well for me.</li>
    <li> The highlighter is my favorite-while the actual brow pencil is awful in my opinion-although if you&#x27;re not going for a drastic look it would probably work...it&#x27;s just too light for me, and not highly pigmented.</li>
    <li> hides the blemishes and works great!</li>
    <li> I love this pencil! I originally ordered it for the brown side but after using the highlighter along my brows and in the corner of my eyes like it shows on the box I will never use another pencil! The brown is the perfect shade to blend with just about any hair color and the highlighter just gives your eyes a total lift and pop. I love this pencil!</li>
    <li> Needs a special pencil sharpener. And I didnt realize that till i got it. Still trying to find one that i can use with this.</li>
    <li> Love it but the brown is not highly pigmented. Very dry.</li>
    <li> This stuff is incredible! I read some reviews and thought, Okay let&#x27;s give it a try. Wow, I have cool eyebrows now! I love it. Easy to use and so cool! Thanks guys!</li>
    <li> This is the first eyebrow pencil that matches my eyebrow color and blends in well. Others have made my eyebrows an odd color or created visible lines. The highlighter is a nice color also.</li>
    <li> This has become a must have for my beauty routine. The brown is perfect for filling in my brows. The \\&quot;pushup\\&quot; pink highlighter is amazing. I did not think I needed a pushup effect but it&#x27;s great. I put a little bit under the brow and then also put some on the inner corners of my eyes and it really makes them look brighter. You can also use just a tad at the upper lip/pout area for more definition .</li>
    <li> Pencil was dull and too chunky to get an accurate shape. It doesn&#x27;t even mark properly. I felt &#x27;duped&#x27; for the price. I do however love the peach highlight.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I mostly use the brow side, not the highlighting side. I wish they made each component separately. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it seems to get used up very fast (I use it everyday). I constantly have to buy another. So much so...that I have been looking for an alternative that may last longer.</li>
    <li> Awesome but doesn&#x27;t last long at all</li>
    <li> I finally found the perfect eyebrow pencil for a natural look .  It is now the only pencil I use!  The box states that this can be used for any haircolor .  I have seen those with light hair use it. I personally have jet black hair and it works fine for me .  I have a very heavy hand when it comes to applying eyebrow pencil so this works perfect for me because it doesn&#x27;t glide right on .  I have found the best way to use this pencil is with very short strokes which make it appear more natural .  The pencil comes with two ends, a dark colored and a pink colored highlighter .  I have never personally used the highlighting portion I&#x27;m just not good at that type of thing but I have heard that it works wonders .  I would highly recommend this eyebrow pencil. I believe if you give it a try you won&#x27;t use any others !</li>
    <li> Love this pencil its great for travel you have a highlighter and eyebrow pencil in one works great</li>
    <li> Really love this for a brow lift. It was an impulse buy and has become part of my daily make-up routine. Would recommend purchasing the sharpener made for this product.</li>
    <li> I am giving 2 stars because in the beginning I was enjoying it. It gives a natural look to fuller eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem started when I had to sharpen it (which was soon). I did and it seemed ok, but then it broke and the second time I sharpened it was all gone. Now I just have the highlighter, which so far doesn&#x27;t even need to sharpen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I am very disappointed with it. I don&#x27;t recommend and I will never buy again.</li>
    <li> Great value.  Brow pencil is good, highlighter is great.</li>
    <li> I l-o-v-e this pencil! I needed a brow highlighter but didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton so this is a happy 2-for-1 combo! The pink shade glides on smooth and I just blend it in with a shadow brush. I really bought it for just the highlighter end as I use a Revlon brow pencil, but I&#x27;m happy with the brow side, too! I have dark brown hair and this fills in my brows just as good if not better than the Revlon pencil. I picked up the NYX sharpener, too.</li>
    <li> Darker than I thought. Maybe I&#x27;m using too heavy a hand. Do like the highki</li>
    <li> Love this eye pencil! Perfect for shaping and highlighting the brows.</li>
    <li> Was wondering if I would like this product but I think it makes a difference. I&#x27;ve never used anything specifically like this before. For some reason (maybe hormones @ 42 yo) it seems as though my eyebrows are thinning. This helps make my eyebrows look a bit more &amp;#34;lifted&amp;#34; &amp; filled in. I am naturally a dirty blonde &amp; the color works well for me.</li>
    <li> Sounds much better than it is.  I&#x27;m not impressed with the product but the seller did a great job of getting the product to me on time, in excellent condition and at agreeable price. thanks!</li>
    <li> Best brow pencil I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
