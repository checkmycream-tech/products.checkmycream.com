<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the best stuff. I use it often and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product with high hopes after reading the reviews... It really didn&#x27;t do much for me. You may as well use any other basic oil. No difference... no miracle. It doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
    <li> What a great discovery this oil is! It works for everything! I recently tried it on fire ant bites. They went away so fast and there was no itching that normally accompanies them. I keep trying it on new things and whatever it&#x27;s used on, it stands up to the test. This stuff is truly a miracle!</li>
    <li> I would recommend Miracle Oil to ANYONE. I discovered it at the spa where I have regular facials done. My esthetician recommended I use a few drops of it in my moisturizer each day. You&#x27;d think that oil would be bad to put on your face and would cause breakouts. But this DOESN&#x27;T! It actually clears up skin conditions and blemishes! If I get a bug bite, I apply Miracle Oil and it stops itching. If I get a burn while cooking, on goes the Miracle Oil, and it doesn&#x27;t even blister! I use it in my moisturizer every day, I put a little on my hair after showering, and use it when I get a sunburn. My son and husband have been using it, too (with lots of persuasion ;) ) and are very happy with the results (acne clearing up, dry, flaky skin healing). LOVE Miracle Oil!</li>
    <li> My daughter has terrible itching especially at night time. Upon the advice from my sister we tried applying Miracle Oil just before bedtime. It works! We mix about a tablespoon of body lotion +teaspoon of Miracle Oil and apply it on our daughter. This takes care of her itching!</li>
    <li> Amazing for cuts and after waxing to prevent shaving bumps</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this product.  It was initially used by my manicurist and I liked it so well that I bought some.  I have callouses that have developed on the inside of my thumbs and they have been greatly reduced by its use.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE miracle oil and this particular product was shipped right on time and everything I needed it to be! I will DEFINITELY be purchasing from this seller every time I need anything of this type! Thank you so much!!!</li>
    <li> Will give it that 5th star after I&#x27;ve used this long enough to say it works great.  Stay tuned.</li>
    <li> Photo shows the Healing Oil, which is what I thought I was ordering.  I received the Soothing Oil, which is ok, but has different (lower) concentrations of the oils I wanted, like Tea Tree Oil.  Works ok as a cuticle oil &amp; for general use, like on my feet, etc.  The Healing Oil, on the other hand, is wonderful for cuts, scrapes, pimples, cracked skin, etc.  Disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get what I thought I was ordering, but the hassle to return vs the amount of the purchase made it so that I&#x27;ll just use it for general use and try to order the real Healing Oil from somewhere else.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first discovered it through my grandmother; she used it to help her skin heal after small nicks and dings that brought blood.  I suffer from unsightly cold sores and have since a child so I am always, well was always, searching for something to shorten the amount of time the sores last and the amount of pain I suffered during their unwelcome visits.  With Miracle Oil, I know that I will be in and out of a cold sore in less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, everytime one of my kids gets a zit, scratch, sun burn, dry skin, or even stinky feet I apply Miracle Oil.  I can not say enough good things about this product. In fact, the only bad thing about it is the small jar it comes in.  It should be sold by the gallon.</li>
    <li> This oil is not good for anything!! It hasn&#x27;t helped at all and the company never has returned my inquiries!! Stay away from this stuff.</li>
    <li> Seems to be helping the plaque psoriasis on my hands, but I can&#x27;t get used to the odor ~~ I have to add a little bit of lavender oil so I can deal with it.</li>
    <li> Excellent topical oil for skin condition issues.  All ingredients are highly prized for skin care.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> It took longer than promised for delivery, but the producer works great!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use anti-biotic cream from the pharmacy -&lt;br /&gt;good ole fashion oils, especially Tea Tree oil works&lt;br /&gt;much, much better - this heals naturally!&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I appreciate your fast service.  The oil is especially good for nails and cuticles.</li>
    <li> This is some of the best oil available!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for nearly a year.  It helps with scars, healing and dark spots.  It smells good and works well.</li>
    <li> I started using this on a bacterial skin infection I got from a puppy nipping my fingernail, and it worked great. I used it on a zit, and it was moderately effective. In the past, I&#x27;ve tried straight tea tree oil for skin problems, and it caused my skin to become red and irritated if I used it more than once or twice a week. For some reason, I can use this product (which also contains hemp seed oil, jojoba, apricot, avocado, and a bunch of other stuff) several times a day with no problems. I&#x27;ve also used it to treat a fungal skin infection on an adopted pit bull, after the expensive and messy Conzol spray from the vet had no effect. Within 2 or 3 weeks, treating her every 2-4 days, her skin was a nice, healthy pink and was growing new fur.</li>
    <li> I bought this when I noticed I had gotten a fungal nail infection from a salon, and I swear I saw a difference in only a couple days. I&#x27;ve since started using it for other things such as bug bites, dry skin, and my \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot; bumps on my arms. I highly recommend this and will surely buy it again if I run out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for dry cracking skin around my nails. It healed these areas quickly and with regular use has kept it from reoccuring. I recently crashed on my road bike ending up with quite a bit of ugly and painful \\&quot;road rash.\\&quot; After the initial use of antibiotic I began using this oil on the injured areas. My wounds have healed in 4 weeks and there are barely visible or no scars left.  I plan to purchase this product as gifts for relatives for Mother&#x27;s Day!</li>
    <li> Love it! Have been using it for years. Excellent price!</li>
    <li> I found out about this oil by accident and I am so glad I did!!  I had a sore on the back  of my neck from my C-pap mask straps and it wasn&#x27;t healing so my beautician suggested this  oil!!  It cleared it up so fast and very nicely that I recommend it to everyone now.  In  fact my manicurist has now begun using it and she is thrilled with the results as are her  customers!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product about 2 years ago. I fell in love with it. I&#x27;m an esthetician and so I use it after I do waxings, on burns, rashes, etc. Its amazing!  I do recommend this to everyone. This should be in your medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> mmm.....&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m not hating on this product but i&#x27;ve tried it on several things such as&lt;br /&gt;scabs&lt;br /&gt;acne&lt;br /&gt;redness&lt;br /&gt;dry skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just not effective enough for me. Don&#x27;t know why</li>
    <li> simply the best. i use it from head to tow for a variety of things. i tell anyone i know about this product. I have even used it on dogs for skin issues.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and like it--glad to find it again and received quickly.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I purchased this wondering if it was snake oil, and hoping it wasn&#x27;t.  Small fungi on toe nail that was there for a couple of months disappeared in 2 days.  Simply amazing.  Use in very small quantities, works great.</li>
    <li> It works on so many things! We used it on bug bites to Poison Ivy.  It healed everthing so much faster. I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> I will never be with out this product. Heals cuts quickly, softens cuticles. I even put it on a wart and it went away.</li>
    <li> Use this oil for several different things!  Even used on a cut for my dog and it worked great.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Have reordered.</li>
    <li> I got my nose pierced 6 years ago, and right away (even with constant cleaning) my nose got infected.  I found this oil and it healed everything right up.  I use it on a daily basis.  It keeps my skin moisturized and dewey!</li>
    <li> This is the best oil, I have ever used.  It is great for everything, such as keeping your natural finger and toe nails strong and beautiful. Its also, a good  massage oil with a little medicine like smell. I also, add it to my lotions for a soft feel.</li>
    <li> I use this product on everything and it always works! Nails, pimples, scratches, my dog, etc.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It does wonders for my nails and  skin. I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Ordered this after reading good reviews here and on the internet.  Was hoping it would help with my eczema but it didn&#x27;t.  Not too fond of the smell either.</li>
    <li> This oils is fabulous. I use it as a face wash, moisturizer, and healing agent for minor scratches, cuts &amp; burns.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s the tea tree oil in it, but I love this stuff for everything from skin irritations to breakouts. It worked wonders on yeast diaper rash . No that is definitely not listed as one of its uses, but it was mild and effective. It started clearing up a fierce candida diaper rash in 24 hours of use. Totally anecdotal, but the candidal rash was diagnosed by a pediatrician - they did not recommend the oil, I decided to use it after the pediatrician&#x27;s treatment was taking too long (in my opinion, obviously).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended for baby skin that isn&#x27;t intact, I&#x27;m sure it would work great, but it stings a little. Another weird use - skin blemishes in ahem - private areas. It&#x27;s very mild and works great.</li>
    <li> Great oil! Useful for so many skin problems/injuries! Love it!</li>
    <li> This oil has been allowing my skin to heal and recover without blocking my pores. I would recommend this to any body who&#x27;s tired of those scar creams that produce no results.</li>
    <li> I over processed my hair coloring it a few weeks back when my mom was at the hair dresser she gave her a sample of this product for me to use in my hair. It worked great it brought back the shine and I was actually able to style my hair. I am going to continue using this product so I don&#x27;t have to cut off the overprocessed hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! I put it on my acne scars every night and I see a huge difference! Just look at the ingredients, everything that&#x27;s great for skin. Miracle oil is the perfect name for it!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best product I have ever used. So versatile. I use it for dry feet, insect bites,  lotion,  cuts, on nails and acne. Love how it uses oils instead of harsh chemicals</li>
    <li> is the best!  It&#x27;s soothing and rejuvenating and I just love it!  I would recommend it to anyone.  I would buy from this seller again</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT!!! This oil works wonderfully. We were flooded out on Sept. 13, 2013 and in trying to catch and take care of our kitties one of them freaked out and bit me, twice. I was still healing when I found out about this Healing Oil. I used it on the bites. They healed up in record time and didn&#x27;t even leave a scar. I&#x27;ve started using it on bruises, scrapes, and callouses as well as the cracked dry skin on my heels and elbows. This stuff healed my nail lady&#x27;s eczema on her hands that she had suffered from for years.</li>
    <li> A family member introduced me to this product about a year ago to clear up my skin. My skin was getting worse over a 10 month period, becoming oily with bumps like white heads that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of. Weird because I usually have dry skin. I started to mix this product with my regular daily face cream that I&#x27;ve been using for years, and sometimes by itself before bed and my skin cleared up within 2 months. I still use it and my skin still looks great! I&#x27;ve also used it to assist with healing some recent tattoos by mixing it with my lotion. They healed 2x faster. I also part out some of it, mix with a few drops of essential oils and rub it on my feet before bed. Yummy. I&#x27;ve even used this product to treat dry, split ends. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I used it on a wound and haven&#x27;t seen any miracle in it yet. It didn&#x27;t speed up the healing time. Not as descibed.</li>
    <li> I use it on my face when I break out or with my dry skin.  Love the essential oils it has.</li>
    <li> I used for ear infarction for my dog 2 times a day.I don&#x27;t count drops.May be 6-10.He was every 2 months on antibiotics and other medication.For 3 days infarction gone. Now I use for his sensitive skin.I hope my review help  people who have the same problem with dogs and help save money.It is a miracle.</li>
    <li> This oil is awesome:) I use it for so many things and have shared it with all my friends. I have decided to give all the people on my Christmas list a bottle for Christmas cause I know they will love it and they will love me even more for giving them a bottle.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and was so excited about getting this oil. I&#x27;ve used it for my dry skin, zits, cuts just as other reviewers have mentioned and honestly haven&#x27;t noticed anything terribly miraculous. It&#x27;s a good, moisturizing oil. It does have a bit of a medicinal smell but I think that is the tea tree oil mostly. It does moisturize my cuticles (my hands get very dry) but other than that, I haven&#x27;t found it to be that great on minor zits. I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;m comfortable using it on my face. I&#x27;ll probably continue to use it on my skin for dry spots and minor nicks.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  It helps keep my acne down and skin is soft.</li>
    <li> I love this! Amazon is the cheapest I have found for this product. It smells great and feels nice!</li>
    <li> I keep my hands in water a lot, and they get cracked and dry. Using this oil on my hands a couple of times a day has helped tremendously! I love it!</li>
    <li> I GAVE A BOTTLE TOO MY DAUGHTER,WITHIN THE FIRST WEEK OF USE THE OIL SHE CALLED ME TO ORDER SOME MORE.SHE SAID THE DARK MARKS  FROM ECZEMA HAVE FADED,I&#x27;VE TRIED EVERYTHING AND THIS IS WORKING.I&#x27;M APPLYING ON MY ELBOWS,AND I CAN SEE A TREMENDOUS CHANGE WITH THE DARK MARKS.WONDERING IF YOU HAVE A INTERNAL PRODUCT THAT ADDRESSES CANDIDA,AND YEAST.CAN&#x27;T WAIT UNTIL YOU RESTOCK THIS PRODUCT!PLEASE ALERT ME.P.S.WE CAN EVEN TOLERATE A STRONGER STRENGTH OF YOUR OIL.THANK YOU</li>
    <li> I picked up this product because I suffer from light to moderate psoriasis and some of my friends with similar conditions also suffer from same. They recommended this product to me. I waited a few months to review it because when I was reading the reviews of it - no other users had mentioned that it had helped their psoriasis and I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would help at all. I&#x27;ve tried Vitamin E oils before and they actually made the condition worse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many products over the years with limited success. After four months of using it every other days (or when itchy) I am seeing REAL healing going on. It isn&#x27;t instantaneous and I have had to use it religiously after every shower but this product really helps with the itchy, redness of the condition!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin gets really bad when I itch the patches but I&#x27;ve been putting this oil on it when it itches and it takes it right out which allows my skin to heal. It doesn&#x27;t clear it completely but it helps. The oil is very light and my skin absorbs it easily. It has a light, pleasant smell that dissipates quickly so you don&#x27;t smell of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about it is the two bottles sometimes run out near months end and I wish it came in a little larger bottle. My condition covers about 25% of my legs, arms and back so I use a lot of it. I have a recurring subscription and I highly endorse this product. I&#x27;ve had personal success with it anyhow. It&#x27;s not a complete healing but it really helps with the itch and it&#x27;s dissolving the scale of the condition.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 (4 bottles total) of what I expected was the HEALING Formula (as per the photo... the label on the photo as of this writing reads: HEALING). I have used the HEALING Formula for years and love it. I could not find it in the stores that used to carry it (Beauty Supply).&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I received the SOOTHING Formula. I assumed it was a mistake. It was re-sent and again I received the Soothing formula (now I have 8 bottles). The SOOTHING Formula is NOT the same. The main ingredient is now... yuck... Soybean Oil (GMO). I&#x27;d rather they used Jojoba as the base instead of GMO Soy if they were going to change the base ingredient. The main ingredient in the HEALING Formula was Hemp Oil (and less Soy Oil). There also seems to be less Tea Tree Oil in the SOOTHING formula.&lt;br /&gt;ETA 4/4/2015: I did try this Soothing Formula, and it does heal up skin problems and also soreness after a mani/pedicure. I had one nasty dog claw scratch that went pretty deep (while playing with the 4-legged), and several others that barely broke the skin but left long inflamed marks. So I used hydrogen peroxide to clean the scratches and then massaged the Oil into the skin for about 5 minutes. By the third day the redness and minor scratches were gone, and the deeper scratch was sealed shut. This formula does work, it just seems diluted compared to the Healing Formula (which I do still have half a bottle left). I gave a bottle of the Soothing Formula to a 70+yo friend, and he used it on a hurt finger and he was surprised how quickly it healed up for him. So while I am still on the fence about the Soothing Formula being as good as the Healing Formula, I did raise my review from 2 stars (I don&#x27;t like it) to 4 stars (I like it).</li>
    <li> I have been using on my feet for years, love this stuff heals all the cracks and sores, softens your hands too</li>
    <li> I use it everyday. Makes my skin nice and soft and I don&#x27;t break out. My friend said it helped with psoriasis as well. Will recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday! I have bought some for my grown children also. I put it on my face,neck, hands, feet you name it. It absorbs within a few minutes and makes my skin glow!</li>
    <li> Best product ever my aunt burned her back on a heating pad.  We used the oil 3-4 times a day it healed slowly but as bad as it was she never got an infection and she has no signs of scaring great stuff</li>
    <li> My hairstylist does my nails and hair every week and she has me using this, so I purchased two sets, one for her and one for me. My hands are doing so much better with this Miracle Oil.</li>
    <li> This Miracle Oil is a miracle! It is my all-time favorite purchase as far as a simple, low-cost product that has wildly exceeded my expectations. I now have this on the Amazon Autoship Subscription so that I receive a new allotment every couple of months. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> Great price and great product. There is nothing alike to this product. Me and my family use it for acne, scars, etc. and we really do see a difference. You don&#x27;t need a lot of oil so these bottles can last you a while. Attached are two photos of the product, including the ingredient list. (Note that this is one of the bottles. If you order this pack, you will get two bottles like this.)</li>
    <li> Awesome price! So glad I found this product. My mom uses it for everything. They stopped selling it in the supply store</li>
    <li> Yes it is a miracle drug.  Use it on a cut, scrape, etc., and you will get fast relief and healing.  Give it a try and you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s true.</li>
    <li> This oil is good on any part of your body.  I put a little on my face after applying moisturizer.  Believe it or not, you can put it on a sunburn and it helps.  I was told to never put oil on a burn, but not this oil.  I highly recommend it.  My daughter uses it too and this is the best price and shows up quick and packaged very well.  Never had a problem.</li>
    <li> Exactly what it is labeled, miracle oil! I use this as a moisturizer on my face, amazingly helped with acne!</li>
    <li> This stuff truly lives up to the name! I first purchased this because I always break out after getting my brows/lip waxed &amp; it totally prevented that problem. I&#x27;m an Aesthetician, so I always like to try products out on myself before offering them to clients. Every client who has tried this stuff either buys it on the spot or comes back for a bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 weeks ago, my hand was very badly burned with bacon grease and I was sure I would have permanent scars. 5 days after the burn, it occurred to me that Miracle Oil might help… it totally did! There is only the slightest discoloration on my hand, but the mark is basically the exact same color as my skin. I had an older scar on my hand and it&#x27;s pretty much healed that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a million reasons to have this stuff-- even if you don&#x27;t have a need for it right now, trust me, you will.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my face, neck and hands at night and in the morning.  It travels easy and lasts a while for my usage.  My face is a little slick for a while after applying.  But at night that is fine and in the morning, I&#x27;ll apply it after my shower and face wash.  By the time I put my makeup on it has pretty much sunk in.  It makes my skin feel conditioned and moist which I like.</li>
    <li> Best deal around, will order more</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizing product. This was the only product that soothed my eczema and dry skin! I highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I guess with all the advertising I was looking for a bit more from this product, but to be honest I didn&#x27;t really see any results with it.  Was delivered on time and packaged well, so the seller is good and I would order products from them again.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well for what I am using it for!</li>
    <li> I bought some of this oil at my local hairdresser and I am sold on the product.  It is a delightful blend of natural oils and has amazing healing qualities.  A little goes a long way, so it last a long time, but still, at $12 for a one ounce bottle, I figured I could do better online.  I am delighted to have found this on Amazon and am able to get two bottles for about the price I paid for one at the salon.  Since I have limited income, this was great news!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this oil on blemishes, any kind of scrapes, toenail fungus, as a cuticle oil, and to ease dry skin patches that I get in the cold weather when I remain inside a lot.  It accelerates healing on just about any skin problem you can name.  It has a light feel and a pleasant, light fragrance.  A very good product and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a topical treatment for skin conditions or irritations.</li>
    <li> Walking my dog 5 times a day in these sub freezing temperatures my hands get so dry, chapped and cracked despite daily multiple moisturizing. A holistic doc friend of mine suggested this and this has helped so much. HIGHLY recommend. It helped me. I use the oil. Rub it in on my hands. Then moisturize and lock in the oil with a good hand cream.  Best product!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best little items I have found in a LONG time.  I have found that when I use it, my fingers do not crack around the nails in cold weather like they used to............and I use it on my face every day.............it is clean and refreshing and helps so many little annoying problems you can have with your skin..........................GREAT product!</li>
    <li> I have very dry, cracking skin around my finger nails. This product makes it smooth and intact. The price is very reasonble for the results it gives. A very little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  I apply it to my freshly shampooed hair, leave it overnight, and rinse it out in the morning.  It helps condition my hair and gives it a nice sheen.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. The very best for healing mosquito bites that have gotten infected. For healing due to abrasions, cancer removal rehab of skin, and for all over maintenance cannot find anything better. A true miracle oil.</li>
    <li> Works on anything! Love it!</li>
    <li> This Oil is Amazing! I saw it in a book &amp; I liked what it said on the product!everything was True!This is a Bottle of Blessings!Great for many Skin problems.I love it on my Toes.Thank God I found it!Peace &amp; Blessings♥</li>
    <li> I recomended it too my  daughter,my son, my ddaughters best friend,for there toe nails too its easy to apply.Have used product for 2 months now.Nails are starting too clear up.</li>
    <li> The skin is less dry.</li>
    <li> works gtreat, all good, quick shipping</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every method and product and have over 10 tattoos.  This actually works, no scabbing, smells good and all natural!</li>
    <li> Love this oil!  Works great for keeping my scalp moisturized when I wear weaves.  The dropper easily fits through the net and between my braids.</li>
    <li> Great for preventing and healing razor burn.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and love it. Well worth the money. It is good for just about any problem you have - rash, fungus, dry skin,etc.</li>
    <li> The lady that waxes my face and eyebrows would use the wonderful product on my face after the waxing and it felt so good.  She shared with me what it was and offered to sell me a bottle.  I thought about Amazon and knew if they had it it would be cheaper.  As soon as I got home I went to Amazon and there it was and I got 2 large bottles for what 1 would have cost.  I use this everyday on my face and neck.  Your makeup will look and feel so much better and will last longer too.  Try it for yourself I believe you will be very pleased!!</li>
    <li> I happened to try this oil basically just for thy heck of it. I put it on my throat and under eyes and it takes away the majority in lines and wrinkles.  It absorbs into the skin and within 20 minutes it gives a nice glow without appearing greasy.</li>
    <li> The order was efficiently and promptly expedited.  I use this product for all skin problems...rashes, itching, cuts. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this oil and use it on all minor cuts or fungal infections. Especially in the winter I constantly get tiny cuts on my hands from the combination of heat and cold air. This oil is the perfect remedy. I also get those nasty skin cracks on my thumbs especially and this oil helps heal those.  It smells of tea tree oil but there are other healing oils in it. Tea tree should not be used undiluted.</li>
    <li> Received the soothing formula, but ordered the healing formula. Still works, but not quite the same.</li>
    <li> I love this oil, my daughter is a gymnast and this heals her rips like magic, if you don&#x27;t know how nasty gymnastics rips can be just google it.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this daily on his face, I can&#x27;t believe I was able to get 2 bottles for less than the price I usually pay for one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this several times because I keep giving them away! Great stuff. I had a toenail problem that nothing seemed to help. Putting this on twice a day healed it as the nail grew out. I have pretty toenails that I&#x27;m not ashamed to show now!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I had some small cuts and an insane sunburn from a recent trip.  Lathered up the cuts and burns in this stuff and heal time was cut in half.  Great smell too!</li>
    <li> Good stuff. I use it for dry skin on my face as well as some nasty excema on my daughters leg. High quality and works fast.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells heavenly, but the best part is how it works. My favorite is putting it on my face after a hot shower/bath. So moisturizing and fresh. A little goes a long way. I also use it for cuticles, healing cuts, razor burn, acne and hyperpigmemtation. Can be used for many things. I notice a difference in my skin for sure. I hope this stuff is always available to purchase. Doesn&#x27;t break your wallet, it works, and is 100% natural. What could be better? Can&#x27;t wait until hemp takes over the world.</li>
    <li> Wow, this stuff really is Miracle Oil. I used it for years on my nails and skin, and loved how therapeutic it was. Last year I gave some to my dad, a retired physician, who suffers from diabetic peripheral neuropathy, to use on his shins where his skin is thin and sometimes cracks and turns into a sore with little provocation (not to mention the intense pain of a neuropathic crisis). He has used Miracle Oil now for a year or more, and he swears by it. Even during a recent hospital stay, he lobbied with the hospital so they would allow him to continue his daily application of the stuff, and amazingly, they agreed. It has made a huge difference in his quality of life! I heartily endorse it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I have it on auto order and use it for hands, feet, and boo boos!  Non irritating, soothing, smells great and effective for healing rashes, dry skin and irritations.</li>
    <li> I brought this in a package deal with two other bottles,  thought I was getting the other version of the miracle oil.  But they are all the same.  Great price for product,  but they get you in shipping charges.  Items came quickly via usps</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  I put it on my kids scrapes and they&#x27;re healed faster than with ointment.  Also great on mosquito bites, dry cuticles, whatever skin irritation. And it&#x27;s all natural. I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
    <li> This was recommended me by my hairdresser who uses it on hands that often become chapped or get nicked in the course of her work. I have not tried it yet. Amazon had the best price for the most highly rated brand.</li>
    <li> have order numerous bottles.  Makes skin very soft &amp; great scent.  Good value. I have recommended it to numerous people</li>
    <li> this item helps with scar care, chapped lips, dry cuticles and hands.  works fast and you do not need much to get results.  my cuticles have never looked or felt better in the winter months.  recommended.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it is a Miracle oil however I know that tea tree oil is a good product so as I said, it is just OK</li>
    <li> This oil does heal up small skin eruptions.</li>
    <li> The name says it all. I use it for so many things but most notably it helps keep my skin clear of blackheads. I just mix in a couple drops with my lotion after I wash my face. I also use it when I massage my scalp and my hair grows faster and is healthier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years, before it was available on Amazon.  It is amazing and is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. I recommend it for everyone, especially if you have trouble spots (dryness). It has also helped some scraps and cuts heal a little bit faster.</li>
    <li> Did not do what it claims to do.  Plain tea tree oil is much better. I am very ve y disappointed</li>
    <li> *I am not a medical doctor, all comments are based on my personal experience.* My hand usually cracked and the regular lotion just don&#x27;t work. I tried so many products, balm, super hydrating lotion but they just won&#x27;t help my hand to heal. I stumble into this product while I was searching for spa treatment for hand. At first I use the oil as my primary hand care, then when my hands got improved (about 2-3days) I start to blend the miracle oil with my hand creme. This winter my hands are finally no longer looked scary with cracks and blood. They are very pampered like having a manicure everyday :) ps. I also recommend to wear the moisturizing gloves, it really helps the healing process :)</li>
    <li> I bought this because the Pure Romance Miracle Oil was not available. The hemp oil smell is very strong with this oil. It works ok, I just prefer the other oil when it is available. I will keep using though.</li>
    <li> Works great for cuticles and insect bites. It also seems to speed up the healing process for scars. I am very pleased with it</li>
    <li> I am in love with this stuff, I like it by itself and I like it mixed in lotion too.  It&#x27;s so great for dry skin!!</li>
    <li> May sound strange but this has been effective for treating a toe nail fungus.</li>
    <li> We have used this product in the past and we love it, works great on cold sores.</li>
    <li> The oil has a strong smell, I used it right away on my cuticles and it felt a tingling sensation. I will be using it daily and see the results.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS OIL.  I have used it for several years.  It works on burns, sores, rashes, etc.  It has an anti-fungal agent, moisturizing and healing properties all included.  I buy it every year and give to my children (all adults) for their use also.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this stuff. I have told everyone I know about it and they all love it too. It has cleared up my acne along with my teenage daughters and son&#x27;s face. I used it on my sunburn and it took the stink and pain out...which was great (for this very fair skin lady). I also had some recent surgery with some large scars and it worked really well to help the scars heal nicely. This is great stuff, we now use it for any and all skin irritations at our house. This product is so worth trying!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Good for all that ails you!</li>
    <li> Great value! Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Love this oil! I&#x27;ve been using it on my son&#x27;s feet to prevent athletes foot &amp; is working! Yay!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Cannot say enough good things about this product. I originally bought it out of desperation for a nose piercing that was developing quite a large bump/scar. I had tried just about every other type of soak or remedy out there. This was my last chance before I would resort to emu oil, which I was not looking forward to purchasing. The bump shrunk significantly within the first few days and is practically invisible now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have started using this oil on everything now. My fingernails and cuticles have never looked better. It helps clear up my dry eczema patches, and any other dry skin patch for that matter. This stuff works pretty quickly as well. Whatever you decide to put it on, you will see a difference a lot quicker than you would expect. It absorbs rather fast as well and is very light and not greasy at all. The fragrance is probably from the tea tree oil but it is not too strong and is just the perfect amount of diluted tea tree that your skin needs without irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff truly is what it claims to be... MIRACLE OIL.</li>
    <li> My legs get really irritated from shaving in the winter, but by applying this Miracle Oil every time I shave, my legs are perfectly smooth and beautiful (:</li>
    <li> This body oil worked pretty well.</li>
    <li> keeps my cuticles soft</li>
    <li> Turned on 4 families to this hidden treasure.  It has helped everything from minor skin irritations, to eczema, to keratosis pilaris.  My daughter has keratosis pilaris on the backs of her arms.  The bumps were always significant and noticeable.  This has made them almost unrecognizable.  You would never know she even had keratosis pilaris.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product for nails/hands.</li>
    <li> this stuff is fantastic for nails.  makes them hard, makes them grow faster and keeps them healthy under artificial nails</li>
    <li> I have had cuts, scraps, rashes and this is the ointment/oil that I get to heal it up. This stuff is awsome....</li>
    <li> I used it for nail fungus in my toes and it healed in around 6 weeks. I used it also for skin eczema and it also helped. I haighly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very nice oil I use it on my clients face to calm the skin down, it really works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product works because the smell is so awful, you can&#x27;t stand to have it on your face. I&#x27;m not sensitive to odors, but this is too bad for me to use. I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> It contains oils that I have used before.</li>
    <li> Not really sure what this was supposed to do, but I bought it because it was to clear up some scars after surgery. The product was nice. It felt minty upon appliance to skin which was stimulating, to the blood flood I presume. The results, not really sure as of now. Gets a little oily for those who don&#x27;t like the stickiness but better than Vitamin E oil which is the worse. On the positive, I prefer this over tea tree oil anyday, with the added benefit of other oils. Next, I&#x27;m considering trying Bio-Oil next.</li>
    <li> Use this on everything. It works.</li>
    <li> I love love LOVE this stuff. I use it for so many things. Plaque psoriasis, dandruff, acne, moisturizer, cuticle softener, hair moisturizer, help minor wounds heal, soothing skin after hair removal, etc.</li>
    <li> Best stuff for everything. Cuticles, dry feet!  I love it</li>
    <li> AbFab!!  terrific product.</li>
    <li> Works great on all sorts of ailments and irritations!  My Mom swears by it for her toes.</li>
    <li> Great product fast delivery I order this product on a regular basis and have never had any problems. Thank you</li>
    <li> I purchased this per request of a family member in hopes to treat an old wound on my leg. After using it frequently over the course of a month I didn&#x27;t see hardly any change. I tried it on other small cuts, and even on a chemical burn on my hands and it seemed to help quite a bit though - so I&#x27;m going to rate this 4/5 stars in hopes that continual use on my old leg wound will eventually help.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price!  I used this everyday for two weeks to treat a chemical burn on my forehead--no blistering, painful burning or scarring. It&#x27;s also a great night time moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Nice oil for nail beds.  Not miraculous though.  I did not find it helped much with abrasions or scar prevention.</li>
    <li> Soothing relief to dry skin!</li>
    <li> I had a nail fungus for several weeks.  After two applications fungus was gone.  I also used when my face was red and swollen from a food allergy.  I am glad I bought two bottles.</li>
    <li> Thanks item as described</li>
    <li> Love, love this product.  We use it for so many things.  I will probably never re-order from Amazon though.  This was the first time I ordered from Amazon.  I was supposed to get 6 bottles, and received only 5 that were not broken.  I emailed Amazon&#x27;s packaging dept and never heard a reply.  I do highly recommend the product though - it&#x27;s fantastic!!!.</li>
