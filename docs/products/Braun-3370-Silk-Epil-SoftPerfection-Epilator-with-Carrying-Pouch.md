      <li>my legs look and feel great.   </li>
      <li>Its a great device</li>
      <li>So the results are great, but the ends do not justify the means.  </li>
      <li>really happy</li>
      <li>LOL I read over the reviews again today.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for 2 years now and it works great.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Ironically, the area I have liked it best for is my underarms.</li>
      <li>I am EXTREMELY happy with the product and would recommend it to every woman I know.  </li>
      <li>and yes, the pain does greatly increase in that area.</li>
      <li>The epilator I received works great.  </li>
      <li>Still a great choice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great gadget that I intend to  keep using just not in my armpits.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase.  </li>
      <li>It is a great product.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s made it bearable although it still hurts me a great deal.  </li>
      <li>However, if you wax at home, this is a million times better!!</li>
      <li>very handy and ergonomic.</li>
      <li>and i believe every girl should have this, very handy.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many forms of hair removal methods on my legs and this is the best one yet.  </li>
      <li>I read many reviews and thought this would be the best option.</li>
      <li>With epilating my legs don&#x27;t look perfect but they look better than with shaving.    </li>
      <li>I have tried laser treatments that were partially successful, but the hair is still thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I guess since my wife has no experience with what ever the latest &amp; greatest Norelco epilator</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK but not the best epilation product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice not having to shave every day!</li>
      <li>The improvements they have made over the years are wonderful, and I am completely satisfied.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this epilator and happy that I don&#x27;t have to shave any more!!</li>
      <li>Okay...I bought this item very excitedly after reading all the wonderful reviews.</li>
      <li>Well, it does a great job and and my wife&#x27;s loving it.</li>
      <li>my legs feel nice now for a longer time and even my bikini line suffered great improvements.</li>
      <li>I also used it on my arm pits, and I have never felt so good about wearing a sleeveless shirt as I do now.  </li>
      <li>Epilating may or may not give you picture perfect, baby smooth legs.  </li>
      <li>and it was still good,</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good durable epilator, this is it.</li>
      <li>I hope this feedback will be helpful for some of you ladies, and you need to try it to decide if it is good for you.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m used to waxing, but can&#x27;t do it since I moved to the US and don&#x27;t know where there would be a good place to do so.</li>
      <li>By the way, I have not tried underarms or bikini line so good luck with that.</li>
      <li>Have good lighting to see what you&#x27;re doing.  </li>
      <li>Good bye razor.....</li>
      <li>/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, to combat ingrown hairs, use a good loofa every day.</li>
      <li>Aloe Vera might be a good one.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s been really good.</li>
      <li>Hence, its not as good as waxing in the sense that you do it once and forget about it for 3 weeks.</li>
      <li>3370 is really good</li>
      <li>and then you&#x27;re good to go...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have had this model for years!  While I do think it might be time to retire this model, it has served me well.  It came with several attachments that I did not use.  I plan to upgrade at some point to a model that has more accuracy (it may be the age and dullness of the tweezers now), but I am glad I started out with this model.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not gonna lie, I&#x27;m a wimp to pain and this HURT when I used it right after I got it in the mail...I had never epilated before and was expecting it though so it was bearable. Af first though I could hardly see my legs through the tears in my eyes. But my mission was accomplished after 1 1/2 hours (but I did both of my entire legs, not just the knee and below).&lt;BR&gt;Come the next morning, lo and behold...stubble! So disappointing. So I waited another day and tried again. It didn&#x27;t seem to be working. Sure thing, the darn machine was broken and I knew I would have to send it back. Or was it really broken, I wondered? Soon enough I realized that somehow, inexplicably, those pesky little hairs were coming out steadily, and without pain! How was this possible?? I have no idea. All I know is third time was a charm. NO stubble, very little pain (doesn&#x27;t even faze me), and legs like a movie star for several days (at the time of this review, I have gone for 4 days without even a stray hair peeking out). I&#x27;m hooked on this little miracle!!! If you buy it be sure to go really slow up the leg. I learned that my first mistake was blazing through my hairforest like a lawnmower gone amuck. Doesn&#x27;t work that way, because it just rips the hairs off at the surface. That&#x27;s why I had stubble after only a few hours. I am now the epilating queen when only a week and a half ago I cringed at the thought of even tweezing a single hair off my leg. By the way, I have not tried underarms or bikini line so good luck with that. Maybe someday.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase.  I hate shaving because it gives me a rash, waxing my legs myself is really messy, and getting my legs waxed was so expensive, I could only afford it occasionally.  With the pain softening head, this epilator wasn&#x27;t NEARLY as painful as waxing. The only downside is that it makes a bit of a mess, but next time I&#x27;ll make sure to use it in an empty bathtub so I won&#x27;t get hair all over the floor.  Either way, it&#x27;s not nearly as messy as waxing myself and so much easier.  It does leave a bit of stubble and break off some of the hairs, but for the convenience and the money saved, I&#x27;m quite willing to put up with it.  I love this epilator.  The greatest invention ever.  I&#x27;m so glad I decided to try it out.</li>
    <li> This product is the best online purchase I&#x27;ve ever made, and one of the best all around.  Granted, I have fine hair to begin with, but I also have extremely sensitive skin.  Shaving has always left my skin irritated and I get knicked very easily.  There is very little redness or bumps with the Braun 3370, and I&#x27;ll never have to worry about cutting myself again.  After just a few weeks, my hair is already growing back less frequently, and my thighs have never been this smooth from shaving.  The pain is negligible and doesn&#x27;t take much getting used too.   I was surprised by just how satisfied I ended up being.</li>
    <li> I have used epilators for many years now.  I started with the Epilady.  When that finally died after years of use, I bought the Braun Silk Epil.  I used that for many years as well.  Recently, however, I accidently misplaced it.  Although I was a totally satisfied Braun user, I wanted to shop around to see if there were other products out there that I might like better.  I was impressed with the Emjoi and almost bought it until I spoke with two people who actually have used it.  Both were long-time epilator users, and both were not that thrilled with it.  The saying \\&quot;If it ain&#x27;t broken, don&#x27;t fix it\\&quot; came to mind, and I immediately went to the computer and ordered the Braun.  Well I have to tell you that I absolutely love it!  The improvements they have made over the years are wonderful, and I am completely satisfied.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Epil Softperfection Epilator is the best product I have ever used, say good bye to bumps, descoloration and hair wont grow for weeks. With time you wont have any hair. This tiny product is fast, easy to use and very convinient. you can take it anywhere and everywhere and it lasts for years and years. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I truely recommend you to try it.</li>
    <li> I would like to say first off I would definitely recommend this product. The hair on my legs (calves and thighs) is very thick and very dark, therefore very obvious, I&#x27;m just basically hairy. I usually grow through all kinds of methods to remove the hair; waxing, shaving, creams. This is the best I have ever tried. It does hurt, but like the other reviewers will tell you the pain goes away as quickly as you pass over the hair, and the more you use it the less it hurts. Another plus is my hair usually grows insanely fast, but with this I have been surprised the last week with still smooth legs! I did have a little stubble the first time I used it, but I realized that it was because I was going over the skin too fast, that rips the hair as opposed to pulling it from the root. 1 suggestion: it takes time to do until you really know how to work it so do it while watching TV or listening to music, anything that won&#x27;t have you rushing. Overall great product.</li>
    <li> i should admit that this product arrived about two weeks ago, and i have only just gotten up the courage to try it out... so, BIG wimp about pain, obviously. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;having never waxed or sugared my legs before, i was not prepared for the pain when i started this baby up... ouch.  the hardest part was creating a starting patch, which i admit was quite painful for me.  basically i had to put the device to the area around my ankle, let it burn for about a second, then pull it away, wait a few seconds more for the burn to fade, then try again.  after a few passes i created a clear patch, and started inching it up my leg.  when the pain bothered me, i just inched it back to the patch i had already cleared. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;the inchworm technique is working well for me so far, and the pain does get less and less as you go on.  it basically feels like a little pin prick, which rapidly fades.  the pain-reducing attachment really helps (the epillating head is basically a lot of tweezers rotating very quickly). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;my very dark leg hair follicles are visible through my very pale/translucent skin, which is why i bought this product in the first place.  and after just a short period of use, i can see a difference.  i&#x27;m very impressed!  the pain IS bearable, though it may not seem so at first.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;my advice: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1)Take a nice, hot bath, open up those pores, and exfoliate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2)USE the pain-reducing head. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3)Hold the device at a 90 degree angle, as stated in the literature.  DON&#x27;T press it down hard; just hold it gently and let the weight of the machine press itself into your leg. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;bottom line:  i&#x27;m very glad i bought it, and i&#x27;m going to keep at it until i&#x27;m an epillating pro.</li>
    <li> I just got my SoftPerfection in the mail today. At first I tried it with the massaging head, which worked well. It was painful, yes, but it was very bearable. I expected it to be a lot worse than it actually was.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I managed to epilate both legs today, and found that it worked best without any of the attachments. I have really fair, sensitive skin, and fine hair, so it didn&#x27;t get all the hairs at the root. It broke some of them off, leaving my legs a bit spiky, but I don&#x27;t think anyone will have that problem if their legs have decently thick hair. My legs still looked hair-free.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I read some reviews before buying the product, which was helpful. It is true what they say: go slow so you can get all the hairs. It works very fast and efficiently, even better than an electric razor. My legs, however, are left red and bumpy, but this was my very first time using it.  &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase, and my boyfriend says I&#x27;m obsessed with the little dealie. I recommend the Silk-epil to everyone and I can&#x27;t wait to tell all my female friends about it!</li>
    <li> It is a little bit painful at the begining of using it, but you will soon get used to it.  It&#x27;s good to use it than the wax!</li>
    <li> Easy (after the first or second time)to use even in armpits and bikini areas, don&#x27;t forget to trim the air first. &lt;br /&gt;Really pulls out short hair, much more comfortable then previous models.  &lt;br /&gt;I wish they could improve the amount of hair removed per stroke because that will reduce the time spent.</li>
    <li> I read through all the reviews from other customers before I decided to buy this product. From others&#x27; comments, I had an impression that this is the most amazing product that can resolve women&#x27;s hassle about shaving! I also learned that it doesn&#x27;t hurt too much, and hair doesn&#x27;t grow back too fast. I even went to Braun&#x27;s website to check the this product&#x27;s overview and did research on other websites to evaluate whether it was worth to buy this product. Well, the opinions contributed by others here really gave me confidence that I wouldn&#x27;t need to worry about my hairy body once I owned this product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So I went ahead and bought it. After it arrived, I was eager to use it. When I first time turned it on to speed 1 (I was afraid to try speed 2 because some people said that it hurts more with speed 2), I got shocked by the sound the machine makes when it turns... I hesitated if I really wanted to put this against my skin for few minutes.... Well, I thought that if I didn&#x27;t try it, it would be a waste of money and time to buy and research about it online. So I tried it, and it HURT!!! The sound of the machine was extremely loud, even at speed 1!! However, I still went all the way through both of my legs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The result was just okay. Even now I have been using it for 10+ times, I still always feel that it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair out completely, because I can see the very short part of the hair still sticks on my legs. The machine just doesn&#x27;t pick on the hair that is as short as 0.05cm as the company claims, and this product doesn&#x27;t give my legs a clean look. Just imagine when you see lots lots of this kind of broken hair that doesn&#x27;t get pull out on your legs (I have run the machine 3-4 times over and the product still doesn&#x27;t pick on the broken short hair as it claims to do), it is really ugly and nasty-looking. Those broken hair on my legs are also spiky, so the touch of my legs after shaving is just rough. I don&#x27;t want to touch my legs after shaving. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Though the machine is not satisfactory, I still use it, because I don&#x27;t know about other machines. I seriously consider doing a laser surgery to remove my hair on my legs.</li>
    <li> Getting waxed all the time was getting too expensive, so I decided to try the route of an epilator.  At first I epilated my legs, maybe once a month.  It is a very long process, loud, and painful, though you get used to that part.  I was rewarded maybe a week later with extremely itchy legs as my hair grew back under the skin.  AAAAHHH!  No more.    Now, I use it for my arm pits, my upper lip, and my bikini area (with the help of the razor portion).  I won&#x27;t deny that its painful, but I will say you get used to it.  I have to be in the mood to do my upper lip, but I will say I&#x27;ve definitely got my money&#x27;s worth, and I&#x27;m not caught off guard needing a last minute trip to the waxer when they&#x27;re not open.  Get some cream to help prevent ingrowns.</li>
    <li> I went to a girlie sleepover a couple weeks back, and a friend of mine bort this small machine. I was amazed and what she said it does, and as i have had past problems with hair removal couldnt belive her. She tried it out on my legs and i could really feel the hair being removed by the roots! The very next day i went out and bort one. The results are amazing and lasting, just couldn&#x27;t believe i hadn&#x27;t seen one of these contraptions before!</li>
    <li> If you are a first time buyer/user, do read a sample of reviews - it will help a lot in the decision making process. I thank everybody who have contributed their reviews, as it helped me make my decision. As for the product, this is the perfect thing to use when in between the waxing stages. If you are used to waxing, there is no pain. I have been waxing for the past 5 years and the pain was no more then what I experience while waxing. However, if you have never waxed before you will feel a bit of a prick and redness. Lower legs are definitely much easier to do than the upper legs - but hold you skin taut and you will be fine. The biggest challenge is figuring out how fast to move the epilator - initially I ended up breaking my hair rather than pulling it out. I definitely recommend waxing before using this product. This way you are only dealing with so much hair at a time.</li>
    <li> After spending some time in Europe recently, I learned just how much the French love their epilators, and do not put up with the pain of shaving every day! There are a lot more models available in France, but based upon all my research, this one seemed to be the closest to those available overseas.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it on my legs a few times, and with each use I feel it more infrequently. I tried it once on my pits, but immediately stopped b/c it hurt too much (though my French friend says that it really does become painless with time) and just don&#x27;t have the courage to try it on my bikini, so I can&#x27;t comment on how this works in that area. A negative of this is that you have to plug this in, so you can&#x27;t use it anywhere, but at the same time I wouldn&#x27;t want to use an epilator with batteries (that could slow down midyank - owww!). A general comment: Keep in mind epilating will most likely hurt a lot more if you haven&#x27;t ever waxed (I&#x27;ve been waxing my legs the last 8 months). Also be mindful of ingrowns, so be sure to exfoliate well if you&#x27;re prone to them. Overall, a great product - I save much time in the shower and at the salon!</li>
    <li> I will admit that shaving with a regular razor is less painful, but the beauty of using the Braun epilator is that I have to shave only every few WEEKS!  I am EXTREMELY happy with the product and would recommend it to every woman I know.  Even when the hair grows back, it isn&#x27;t hard and stubbly as it is when you shave with a regular razor.  I was at the beach in May when a friend told me about the Braun epilator and how much she loved it; I now agree with her.</li>
    <li> I have never used an epilator before.  I found this one to be easy to use.  I could not use it on my underarms, however.  It was way too painful.  Everywhere else, it is fine.</li>
    <li> When I saw such mixed reviews about the pain factor, I was a little hesitant.  But I got it and I&#x27;m so glad.  It really isn&#x27;t painful.  Anyone who has ever tweezed or waxed can handle it. It does create a tingly pulling sensation the first time. But nothing that made me feel I couldn&#x27;t continue to use it.  For subsequent uses, no discomfort at all.  And I felt the pain reducing nubby thing only increased discomfort and decreased the speed.  No problem with ingrown hairs-I just continue to use my \\&quot;puff\\&quot; in the shower.  Even use it on my underarms.  Now that was pretty uncomfortable the first time-good thing it is a small area!  All subsequent uses, no problem.  Would definitely recommend to others.  Still shave occasionally but that is to get that ultra smooth feel.  Otherwise, the little bit of hairs left certainly can&#x27;t be seen.  P.S. No Bactine or Alcohol needed!  Have fun and enjoy it!</li>
    <li> I was afraid that will be to painfull, but everything works out fine. Is a great product and I am happy to see my legs clean and silky. Thank you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine, the first one I&#x27;ve ever had, so I don&#x27;t know how to review it. My friend who recommended epilators to me has used them for 15 years tried it, and she&#x27;s buying one. Most of the attachments didn&#x27;t seem to make much difference, but my hair is very thin and not hard to pull out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It has two attachments meant to help with the epilator&#x27;s contact with the skin and efficiency. Another attachment functions as a shaver (for touch up?) and trimmer for cutting longer hair down to optimal length for epilating. That attachment is handy for any shaving and trimming needed, so the tool is more versatile.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for the past 5 years and I love it!!! It does take some time though, and it works best when you let the hair grow out.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for about a little more than a month. I hated waxing and this is a perfect alternative. No mess, easy to clean and works really well. I used it on my legs first and barely felt the pain there. Underarms were a whole another story. It was very painful the first time but somehow I managed to get through it. The results were well worth it! They remained smooth for such a long time. I no longer have to worry about next day stubble like shaving. Also, its no longer painful since I keep using it as the hairs show up. Its a great device and I can&#x27;t imagine being without it now!</li>
    <li> This thing is great!!! Wish I would have bought it years ago!</li>
    <li> I have had a Braun Silk Epil for about 10 years.  I used it pretty much year-round the first 3-4 years, then half of every year since then.  Recently I discovered that the cord to mine was missing.  I looked high and low and being too impatient to special order a new cord, I considered just getting a new epilator.  Mine still worked pretty well but over the years I felt like some of the oomph was missing from the tweezing power it initially had.  I considered a new Braun and I considered an Emjoi.  The Emjoi has more tweezers which makes me think it would be faster and better - but it seemed over and over I would read of Emjois dying after a year or two and needing replaced.  What pushed me back to a new Braun was the known quality...  plus instant availability.  I went to Bed Bath and Beyond and bought a new one.  (They only have the pink model, which doesn&#x27;t come with as much stuff - but the base unit is the same, it&#x27;s the most important component, and you get a nice price if you use the coupons they are always mailing out.  ;-) )    First - the accessories.    The massaging head is supposed to reduce pain.  For all but the most sensitive areas of my legs, I am immune to the pain of epilation so I have NO idea if this thing works.  It seems like it just gets in the way, to me.  I am not convinced there is any way to reduce the pain of yanking out your leg hair by the roots, short of getting used to it (and I think in some areas, you never do)    The efficiency clip is supposed to keep the epilator at the correct angle to make hair removal most \\&quot;efficient\\&quot; ...  IMO, just something else to get in the way.  It doesn&#x27;t take a degree in rocket science to figure out the best way to hold this thing.  The guide just makes it feel akward, kind of like the difference between standing straight on your own vs. shoving a yardstick into the waist of your jeans.  You don&#x27;t need it.    The pink model is also available with an easy start head with fewer tweezers -  *might* be nicein those areas that never get used to the pain, but I think it would just make an already slow process mind-numbingly slow.    The optimum clip or whatever - cuts your hair to the right length for epilation - mine didn&#x27;t come with it, I can&#x27;t see it being very useful.  I find it best to start with a wax and then maintain with the epilator.  No matter how short the hair, the denser it is, the greater the pain.  Waxing will take care of both density and length - you get the hairs that were broken or missed and keep up as new ones come in.  (And waxing need not be expensive, use a Nair roll-on sugar wax kit and do it at home for under ten bucks.  Cheap, but waxing is always a pain because you have to wait for the hair to be long, and it&#x27;s STICKY - epilating grabs short hairs as they come in and is mess-free)    The shaver head - pink model doesn&#x27;t come with it - I think may be good if you are in a hurry or just can&#x27;t quite stomach epilating in spots.  This is the one accessory I think might be useful - of course I don&#x27;t have it.  If you have a good clipper or electric razor anyway, though, it&#x27;s a moot point.      Second - the truth about epilation.    Once upon a time - there was the Epilady.  My mother bought one of these when I was in middle school.  She tried it on herself.  She tried it on ME.  It was, to the best of my knowledge, the only time I ever swore in front of my parents without being reprimanded for it.  That says it all about the Epilady.    When I first noticed the Silk Epil for sale (advertised as painless, at that), I was 18 or so.  I was skeptical.  But I was also hairy and tired of feeling like a side show freak.  (I have PCOS but at the time had not been diagnosed, I just felt ashamed and disgusting and wondered why I had been cursed with so much hair)  I took the bait on the newspaper ad and bought my first hair yanker.  I had a leg wax by that time but I *think* only once and I know it was at least 2 or 3 months prior to using the Silk Epil.  The first use HURT...  but not TOO bad.  Truthfully, if you have reached the level of hairiness that pushes you to look upon yanking your hair out by the roots as a rational decision, you&#x27;re probably willing to handle the pain involved, within reason.  The silk epil is painful but reasonably so.  (It was some time later that I discovered the Silk Epil immediately after waxing as the best way to go - if you are new to it or just haven&#x27;t done it in a while, let your hair grow, wax it, then epilate - that&#x27;s the best way)    There are areas of my legs that never quite got used to it.  The backs of my legs around the knee area - stings, but I can handle it.  High up on the back thighs where it is ambiguosly bikini area - in that if you had a bathing suit on, it would look bad, but never show in shorts, unless you wear Daisy Dukes, which I didn&#x27;t - THAT area, I can&#x27;t handle.  I am working on it.  Bikini area in front (leg to pube crease, not the whole triangle) is totally bearable, as is inner thigh where hair can be coarser and turn to sand paper when shaved and stubbley.  There, epilating is FAR superior to shaving.  No pimples, rashies, etc...    But over ninety percent of my legs, there is now no pain.    Epilating *will* give you ingrown hairs.  If you are lucky, you will have fewer ingrowns than hairs that break the surface.  I don&#x27;t know if there is any way to prevent them all.  I use scrubby gloves in the shower and I am experimenting with a lotion I have concocted mixing Jergen&#x27;s Skin Smoothing lotion(with AHA) and Clean and Clear salycilic (sp) acne gel.  I don&#x27;t seem to get them too badly, but I do get them.  (I just recently got back into epilation so I don&#x27;t know for sure how good my concoction is, but it shows promise)    Epilating may or may not give you picture perfect, baby smooth legs.  The more I do it, the closer I get to \\&quot;smooth,\\&quot; but I never quite reach it (except for the inner thighs, where I guess the hair is both sparse and coarse enough that it isall yanked clean)  My legs don&#x27;t look perfect - no one is going to be chasing me down for a photo shoot - as I have kind of a red/pinkness around most of my hair follicles.  This is not due to epilating, my legs have always been that way.  My theory is that my womanly skin just doesn&#x27;t react well to the beastly hair that grows in it.  It looks *worse* if I shave because then you see the five o&#x27;clock shadow making the dots even more noticable.  With epilating my legs don&#x27;t look perfect but they look better than with shaving.    So my legs don&#x27;t look or feel as great as I would like, but I feel a lot more confident and free when epilating as opposed to shaving.  With epilating my legs always look and feel OK whereas with shaving, they seldom do.  Plus I prefer to sit on my bedroom floor, dry, and do this, as opposed to contorting myself in our cramped and poorly lit shower.      One last thing about epilating - you will on occasion read that you should never do it, that it increases blood flow to the hair follicle, that it makes hair coarser, that it distorts the hair follicle, that it makes you more prone to ingrowns as time goes on.  I have areas of my legs that, after years of plucking, are nearly hair free - the follicles are dead.  My inner thighs used to be HIDEOUS and now there is maybe 1/4 the hair there used to be.  My inner lower legs used to be bad and now also have very sparse hair.  These are the areas I have been attacking the longest, with tweezers long before the epilator.  I don&#x27;t know if this thinning is a factor of the plucking killing the follicles or just something to do with time - or treating my PCOS - but I do know that epilating has not made my legs any worse for the wear.  I have noticed that using this on my face - I used my old one on my face - was a MAJOR disaster.  There are women who say they do it but I found my skin would look great for a few days and then be pimply and ingrown and I would want to put a paper bag over my head.  I finally did laser on my face which is pricey but worth it.  I don&#x27;t think laser is practicle for large areas of the body, though.  It&#x27;s not neccassirily permanent removal, merely reduction, but a touch up for the chin is a lot cheaper and easier than a touch up for the leg.    The reason I give this four stars and not five is because I wish it more tweezers.  It seems it would go faster.  It seems to have 20 tweezers, arranged in 4 rows of 5 that spiral around the head.  The old model had 3 horizontal rows of 8 or 9 (hard to tell) - I don&#x27;t know why they&#x27;d reduce the number.  The brand new tweezing power still makes this work better than my old one, but I still wonder if the Emjoi (with 36 tweezers) may have been the way to go.  I am considering buying a Remington for comparison - I have looked and looked at that model and I am nearly convinced it is a rebranded Emjoi at a fraction of the cost (only with one speed, not 2 - but I only ever use one speed anyway)     Edit - forget Emjoi.  Braun has a new Silk Epil with 40 tweezers - called the Silk Epil X&#x27;Elle.  Not easy to find in the US - Braun says it isn&#x27;t available (I emailed them) but I have seen it for sale here on Amazon and on Drugstore.com (for less than here).  If I can verify that this unit is actually available and will work on US household power, I am getting one of those!</li>
    <li> I love this thing.  Yes, it hurts a little bit, but you get used to it.  And it&#x27;s MUCH easier than waxing.  I used to actually tweeze my legs (it took forever!) and I&#x27;m pretty particular about hair removal.  I have to say, this thing is more thorough than me with a pair of tweezers.  I thought I would still have to do a follow-up tweeze afterwards but I am thrilled to report that I do not.  It gets EVERYTHING.  Yes, you do have to go over each spot more than once -- and it&#x27;s probably a 30-minute or so process for both legs -- but it&#x27;s well worth it.  I also really like that you just plug it in and you&#x27;re ready to go.  There&#x27;s no need to worry about charging or changing batteries.</li>
    <li> keep in mind that this is my first epilator, but i was surprised at how loud it is.  i was also surprised at how many hairs it would miss, therefore making it essential to shave afterwards as well as time consuming.  i was amazed at the terrible amount of in-grown hairs i recieved after starting to use this product, and that is why i only use the shaver attachment now.</li>
    <li> Got mine in 2006 - it&#x27;s 2009 now, and I still absolutely satisfied with my Braun 3370. Simple, easy, compact, dependable. DIXI</li>
    <li> I just bought one last week from amazon.com and tried it the very same day it arrived. I tried it on my leg first. After the first stroke, it was easy. After doing both my legs, I applied moisturizing lotion and waited half an hour to see if there was any swelling or redness of skin. My skin was red the first ten minutes but went back to normal quickly. So then I tried it on my forearm. It hurt a little on my arm but it was bearable. &lt;br /&gt;This small machine is simply AWESOME!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve also hated stubble, gone the waxing route (first paying someone else and then doing it myself at home) and stumbled on the Braun EpilSoft here on Amazon. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;First, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND WAXING before your first use -- otherwise it *will* hurt (and I depil all the normal areas with my Braun). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Second -- and this will make things MUCH less painful:  Prep the area you&#x27;re about to depil with a little Bactine spray (contains lidocaine, a topical anesthetic which numbs the skin a little, greatly reducing the amount of pain -- YAY!) and wait a couple of minutes for it to work before beginning. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I find that going over areas that need doing once a week (slowly, as the other poster stated) is more than often enough to keep me feeling soft and stubble-free!  (Real pain-wimps [like me!] can try gradually working their way into more highly-populated-with-[re]growth sections with short strokes, and then backing off again into previously done/less populated areas, to allow endorphins a chance to enter your blood stream -- this works!) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This SO beats shaving or waxing -- and it takes MUCH less time out of your life in the aggregate than either! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Let me just start out by saying that, unless you have absolutely no tolerance for pain of any sort, and literally shiver at the thought of discomfort, this epilator is certainly tolerable.  As women, we are subjected to physical inconveniences far, far worse than this - and guess what?  This comes complete with a great payoff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate shaving.  Let me just get that out in the open.  It&#x27;s a thankless, endless task - the results are short-lived, and the practice costs money (especially when using a high-end system like the Venus, which I did).  Cuts and nicks are always lying in wait to get you when least expected, and winter time is truly a fearful season, heralding razor burn and dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it only makes sense that I am delighted with my Braun Silk Epil - all of the bothers of shaving are now a thing of the past, and I am most satisfied with my skin&#x27;s newly silky, healthy condition.  I only have to use this epilator every three weeks or so, and I&#x27;m set - and ladies, I&#x27;m talking about legs, arms, bikini and underarms.  Smooth as can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, yes... it does hurt, especially the first time you use it.  And oh, yessir - the underarm area is MUCH more sensitive than the rest of the body.  However, there is one thing that does help - alot - and that&#x27;s called body chemistry.  Upon first using the epilator, my endorphins kicked in so strongly that within just a minute, the discomfort was certainly bearable.  This was especially the case with epilating the underarm area - midway through the experience, the pain level had dropped immensely.  As well, here&#x27;s another helpful hint - take a nice, hot bath beforehand - this eases the discomfort immensely.  And, yes, it does get easier with every usage.  And talk about a task being well worth it - I have never had such clean, soft, pink and shadow-free underarms in my life.  Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about the Silk Epil is that it comes with the epilator head, a shaving head, two seperate epilator covers (one designed for making the experience more comfortable), a nice, long corded adaptor and carrying case.  Caring for the epilator is easy - it also comes with a little brush for sweeping out the heads and covers.  I&#x27;m really surprised at how simple it is to use and maintain this great little gadget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, ladies, if you&#x27;re willing to take the big step toward a happy new grooming practice paying off via a silky smooth body, look no further.  This Silk Epil is the way to go.  And don&#x27;t fear the pain - it does get much easier, and the results make the effort very, very worthwhile.making the experience more comfortable), a nice, long corded adaptor and carrying case.

    <li> I  found that the pain is not that bad at all! Of course after the second to third time that is...I would say the ankles and underarms are the hardest part (very sensative areas for me at least).  Regardless, the product is AWESOME! It is definetly worth for the smooth look (especially if you are wearing strapless dresses &amp; need that silky clean underarm look).  As for my legs--well, my boyfriend can&#x27;t stop asking if he could touch them...yeah, he loves it too and is now suggesting the Silk Epil as gifts for his friend&#x27;s girlfriends!    Also, make sure you turn on the machine and get used how it works before getting it onto your skin.  For me the sound and looking at how fast the grips would rotate scared the hell out of me, however, I came to learn it&#x27;s bark is way harder than the tiny bite (more like a little sting as it pulls hair).  If you&#x27;ve tweeze your eye brows you know the feeling.  Enjoy the tips list- it was invaluable for me!!  I still use many of them.    Tips for first time users.    1. Consider waxing the area a couple of days before using the epilator.  This should help your skin be less sensitive to the pulling out of the hair.  2. Exfoliate regularly to prevent ingrown hairs.  (do not exfoliate right before or after epilating)  3. Don&#x27;t use it a few days before your period. Three days before and first three days of your period (since you&#x27;re retaining water and skin is more sensitive).  4. Epilate in the evening, so redness disappears overnight.  5. Cooling the skin before with a cooling pad will help prevent irritation (cooling time should at least be 30 seconds but not exceed 2 minutes for the same area)  6. Trim the hair to about 2 to 3 mm&#x27;s before doing any epilating because the hair will temporary hang onto the rotary heads before being removed.  7. Take some Tylenol before for pain reduction.  8. Have a nice bath beforehand to clean your skin from oils.   9. Epilator should be held in a 90 angle against the skin.  10. Prep area with Bactine spray.  (Bactin contains lidocaine, a topical anesthetic which numbs the skin a little, greatly reducing the amount of pain).  Make sure to a couple of minutes for it to work before beginning.  11. Have good lighting to see what you&#x27;re doing.  12. Pull the skin tightly as you shave.   13. Be sure to go really slow up the leg. If you use it like a regular shaver it will only rips the hairs off at the surface, leaving you with broken hair and stubble will appear in a few hours.  14. Use (fragrance free non-oily) moisturizing lotion afterwards for reduction of redness/swelling.  Aloe Vera might be a good one. If your skin is swelling, you may consider using hydrocortisone cream.  15. Consider using a toothbrush to clean the device as the brush provided is small</li>
    <li> This thing hurts like hell! I have read all the reviews. I am trying to work with it. I hear how it pays off in the end. I have stuble from trying to hurry up LOL I read over the reviews again today. I am going to give it a few days and try again. ANKLES OUCH! BACK OF LEGS OUCH! Everything else seems so so. Anyone buying this. GOOD LUCK. It hurts and I usually take pain pretty good!  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This epilator pays for itself many, many times over. And actually improves the condition of your skin. I use it for everything - legs, underarms, bikini line... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sure, the first couple of times are agonizing, but with a few uses, the follicle roots get weaker, so the hair pulls out easily, and virtually painlessly. Also, it appears to have an exfoliant effect - pulls off dead, flaky skin on the legs. My legs have seriously never been in better shape.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this epilator for over 6 months now.</li>
    <li> If you are like me and have coarser hair on your legs, this is not a great product.  It does hurt like crazy the first few times, but you do get used to it and then it is no longer painful.  The big issue for me is that I do not get those weeks of hairless legs and so I end up using it often.  Not much better than shaving in that regard.</li>
    <li> The epilator I received works great.  I love the different attachments.  It&#x27;s well worth the money spent.</li>
    <li> I recently bought the silk epil, and I really like it. I have been waxing my legs for about 3 years now, and it was getting a bit costly. This works well, however I only use it on my legs. (Underarms are hard to do) It is a bit time consuming (though waxing took the same amount of time) - however it does the job and I believe is way better than shaving every few days. Plus the hair does grow back thinner and less noticeable. I have been using it about once every week - week and a half.  I think it is great, and after two uses, has already paid itself off!</li>
    <li> I must admit that I bought this with some reservations.  I had read other reviews saying how great it was, but very painful.  I was pleasantly surprised when I got it, and it did not hurt nearly as much as I had been led to believe.  Maybe my pain tolerence is high?  It does a decent job, but I feel that it can leave some stubble in places.  The stubble is long enough to feel, but going over it repeatedly still does not remove it.  Overall I have been pleased with the performance.</li>
    <li> I love it, I love it, I love it......(over and over again).  I got a cheap version of this product just to try it out and when it broke I felt lost.  I bought this one to replace it and it has been the best purchase I have made in a long time.  I like it so much that I got 3 more and I am thinking about getting 2 more some time next week.  I have given them to family members and they just rave about how they love it.  If you are thinking about getting this product go for it.  The pain is minimal if you are some one who waxes or uses suger like I WAS.  This thing is great there is no mess and you don&#x27;t have to wait for the hair to grow out.  If you are some one who shaves you WILL feel pain (how much depends on you), but the pain will be less as you continue to use the handy dandy little thing.  I just love it and what can I say I just love it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for legs and even more; it is painful for the armpits but except for that it&#x27;s great +you have a razor tool which gives the last touch / or quick results. +effects last much longer with the epilator !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s rather precise and does the work. I can&#x27;t speak for the level of pain, because I got used to it and don&#x27;t use the top cover anymore (it&#x27;s faster that way). If you&#x27;re looking for a good durable epilator, this is it.</li>
    <li> I love the Silk Epil.  It does not hurt your skin as others do.  I have had several different ones and this is by far the best one I have bought.  It does sting a little, but the protective bar does help to prevent pain.  I love mine.  Great service!</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;ve removed hair from large portions of my legs by tweezing the hairs out by hand, one at a time.  I assumed the pain from this product would be about the same, but over a larger area.  I was wrong.  The tweezer, even with the pain softener hurts like heck.  I admit, however that I do have quite thick hair and somewhat sensitive skin so it may not hurt you as much.  I followed all instructions, went slowly and quickly, used both speeds, and had little success.  Then I discovered (and I didn&#x27;t see this anywhere in the instructions) that pain is GREATLY lessened if you pull the skin you are epilating as taught as possible using your free hand .  That&#x27;s made it bearable although it still hurts me a great deal.  I will probably continue using it because it&#x27;s supposed to get easier after the first few times.  The shaver head works very well, but the opti-trim attatchment is bogus.  Also, neither the shaver or tweezing heads collect hair very well, so if your hair is long, it may make a mess.</li>
    <li> To confirm other reviews, this works quite well.  But no quality of hair removal is worth this pain.  It is truly incredible.  Consider I am a guy and I used it on my face.  It works well in removing all the hair but it hurts so ungodly horrible that I&#x27;d never recommend it to anyone.  So the results are great, but the ends do not justify the means.  Go get a really powerful cream, wax, something besides this product.  I&#x27;ll be sending it back.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product, very good. It actually stands by its claimed features. Carry out a better job that previous versions.</li>
    <li> i bought this product for my wife, she just loves it. no sign of hair till 2-3 weeks. excellent on skin with no marks. very handy and ergonomic.</li>
    <li> It was a pain to remove hair using the tweezer, but now with this awesome gadget its a breeze. Not that there is not pulling sensation but its not unbearable.  &lt;br /&gt;This is indeed one of the best epilator you could find in the market.</li>
    <li> The product is okay -- quite painful at first, with minor irritation, but not bad compared with other methods e.g. shaving, nairing, etc. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Recommended usage could have been better articulated -- ensure your hair is as short as possible prior to using the product in order to mitigate discomfort.</li>
    <li> This product is great!  I prefer it over shaving or waxing.  No fuss or muss.   &lt;br /&gt;With this tool, all I need is this tool and spray a bit anti-baterial spray afterwards.   &lt;br /&gt;The only things I didn&#x27;t anticipate was that I neededed to glide this tool slowly and many times through the same area.  You can feel slight plucking sensation, but since my hair is quite fine, the pain was not that bad and a lot less compared to waxing. Also, since I don&#x27;t need to do this routine so much now, I have to re-read the instruction manual every time I use it.  I&#x27;m using it once 2~3 weeks now.  I love it, and will definitely buy another one if this one breaks.</li>
    <li> It only got about 60% of the hairs, even after I went over an area many many times.  And many of the hairs just broke off and didn&#x27;t get pulled, leaving stubble.  So I tried an experiment: I did one leg with the epilator and one leg with the electric razor attachment that it comes with.  The epilated leg was only slightly smoother than the razored leg-both were left quite prickly.  Very disappointing.  I will not use it again.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for this particular product and luckily i saw it on amazon. It&#x27;s a very good thing and i believe every girl should have this, very handy.  &lt;br /&gt;the product is travel-easy too. so i can take it anywhere i go.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use and painfree. It removes hair from roots and will hair will not grow for 3 weeks. I use it for my arms, face &lt;br /&gt;and legs. I will recommend this product. Much better than waxing. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> The reason I gave this five stars is because it really exceeded my expectations.  It works really well and doesn&#x27;t hurt like I thought it would.  I remember the epilators from about 10 years ago and they killed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I had done my research with this product and this brand and model got really good reviews on other sites too.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy because I hate to shave and this is easier and the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back for so much longer.  I don&#x27;t have to deal with the messy wax any more either.  I only wish I had bought it sooner before my waxer.</li>
    <li> It works, its fast and its easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure you have read the reviews as I did. Be aware that it&#x27;ll be painful at first, just like when you first plucked your eyebrows and then it gets less painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first tried it I was always shouting Aw! Aw! Aw!. Of course, I havent waxed my legs for quite sometime  so using this epilator would proved to be a grit-teeth-grinding experience. Then you get used to it. hahahaha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if I can use this like a brazilian wax alternative. I&#x27;ll try it tonight. Ive been using this for months nbow so I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start MOWING your legs and good luck.</li>
    <li> The Silk Epil is smooth and faster than the last one I had (Braun too). It&#x27;s still a little bit noisy, which I hoped would be better than my old one. Still a great choice.</li>
    <li> its ok but not my favorite item...it is very time consuming and very painful (i know i have no pain tolerance but still). furthermore it gives me terrible in grown hair. i bought it a year ago and ive pretty much stopped using it</li>
    <li> If you are new to epilation, you will find it painful in the beginning. I had experienced the same when I bought it. I never wanted to try it again after the first attempt. But, the second time, I tried it and it was not that worse and I was able to epilate my legs. I think anyone will get used to the pain gradually and you might never notice the pain one day! It&#x27;s really worth since you dont have to try all those razors in the bath tub every other day. I can&#x27;t say my skin is perfect smooth with epilation, but it&#x27;s a LOT better when compared to shaving. I give it 4 stars!!</li>
    <li> I am a dark haired, fair skinned gorilla...opps I mean woman. I am very hairy. I have used the Braun epilators for years and have learned a few tricks that I want to share.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;First - before you do this the first time, take other reviewers&#x27; advice and wax first or shave the day before. You&#x27;ll have SIGNIFICANTLY less pain if the hair is just detectable with your fingers running across your skin. And take an advil about an hour before, too. And don&#x27;t do it when you are close to getting your period - your body is more sensitive to pain then - wait until after. Don&#x27;t put any lotion or oil on your legs the day you epilate. Lotion and oils make it harder for the epilator to grab the hair. As other reviewers have said, it is truly painful the first time. But you really will feel less and less pain each time. I don&#x27;t even feel anything except a mild massaging when I use it now.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If, after your first time, you let the hair get longer than 1/16th of an inch, you should trim (not shave -- I&#x27;ll explain why in a second) it before epilating or put up with a bit more pain.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Exfoliate at least a few times per week in the shower. I have also found that using a body lotion with AHAs helps keep ingrown hairs away. My favorite is Alpha-Hydrox brand body lotion with 7% AHA because it works, moisturizes well and is not expensive. If you have trouble with ingrwons despite this, get some Tend Skin.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Once you start epilating, DON&#x27;T SHAVE AGAIN! If you do shave, expect ingrowns. This has been my experience. I gave up shaving and now only epilate. I have not had an ingrown in over two years. And it was a tiny one.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now that I am so used to the sensation and no longer feel pain it does not take long to do my full legs. An hour at most. I sit on a towel and do it on a weedend afternoon. I get great, quite smooth results if I have exfoliated my legs (with scrubby gloves) earlier that day. Exfoliating gets any tiny hairs to \\&quot;stand up\\&quot; so they are easier for the epilator to grab.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Make sure you clean off your braun every time you finish epilating! I have a tiny bottle of alcohol. When I am done I shake off the epilating head and brush out as much hair as I can., Then, I spray it with alcohol and let it air dry. If you use a dirty epilator you&#x27;ll end up with red bumps, more ingrowns, and irritation.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After years of epilating my leg arm and bikini hair has become softer, finer and grows back more slowly. It works -- just not instantaneously.</li>
    <li> I was in the habit of shaving my legs and arms and got bored of it :) I wanted to try a method of hair removal that would last a few weeks. I saw the silk epil at my local target and thought of giving it a try, but the model that was available there didnt have an additional shaver head..that i might need for sensitive areas. Then i saw the newer 3370 model in amazon and ordered it. I tried it as soon as i received it, in my arms. I expected to scream in pain, since im epilating for the first time. But much to my surprise, it was not as terrible as i thought. I could feel pulling sensation on my skin and a little redness afterward, but definitely bearable for anyone who has undergone the pains of tweezing or waxing. I still havent tried it on my legs, waiting for hair to grow. In short, its a good buy &amp; its definitely a keeper!  Update:  I have finally tried this on my legs and had the same experience as with my arms. I just felt some pulling sensation. Manageable. I would try epilating without the pain minimizer the next time :)</li>
    <li> I have particularly difficult body hair - shaving causes constant problems with ingrown hairs, waxing costs too much over the long term, plucking is incredibly time-consuming, I&#x27;ve tried electrolysis and laser hair removal...none have worked in any marginally satisfying way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I bought this product six months ago as a last-ditch effort to tame my petulant body hair, having always been afraid of a machine that would rip out my hair. Honestly, I have rarely been as happy with a purchase. I have had three friends buy this product because it is so effective and so very worth it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Word to the wise: it hurts A LOT the first two times you use it, after that you can hardly tell it&#x27;s doing anything. I actually have to get a mirror and check my underarms because I can&#x27;t tell anymore if everything is gone. Not only that, it does what it promises and you never get ingrown hairs and razor burn is a thing of the past, it is virtually pain free after the first two times and seems to work on any part of the body you try it on. And I have tried all of them. I have abandoned razors entirely because this is such a satisfying alternative. Things look precise, clean and smooth, and the results last for about a week before you need to take five-ten minutes for cursory maintenence, which is basically painless with the world&#x27;s easiest cleanup. Like I said, I&#x27;ve never had a problem with swelling, ingrown hairs, excessive pain, I&#x27;ve never been cut in any way - I am so happy I got this. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When you first turn the machine on and see the thing spinning, you think to yourself, \\&quot;Someone actually expects me to put this demonic little machine to my body?\\&quot; Like I said, the first two times you want to break the stupid thing, or throw it in a drawer and never use it again, but wait until the third time and you will see exactly how great this little device is. It really changes your whole approach to personal grooming, because now it becomes basically without hassle ormess.</li>
    <li> This item has really been a Godsend for me, I cannot praise it enough. It has given me the freedom to be able to go on vacation and wear a bikini without having to spend 45 mins in the bathroom shaving every other day, I can go to the closet and pick out a skirt or sleeveless top without having to worry that I did not shave my legs or underarms. I can be with my partner at anytime without worrying about the stubble appearing on my legs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I honestly dont know why I did not buy this before, I think it is because my mother used to have an ancient epilator that I used once and never tried again due to the incredible pain and the fact that it barely removed any hairs.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I got to the point of being so sick of shaving every day for 15 years, I read the reveiws saying the the epilators have come a long way and and decided to try it again. The first time you use it it is very important to grit your teeth and just go for it, it hurts but you must do it, do all of the areas you usually shave including underarms and bikini line. It is true that the Braun makes epilating the knees pretty impossible but that is the only downside, it is an excellent machine, and removes 100% of hairs that are not to short for it to grasp. The hair only needs to be about 2mm for the Braun to be able to pull it. The pain releiving head really helps also, it is much like when the nurse scratches your arm prior to taking blood, it kind of very lightly scratches your skin as it goes along so that the hair pulling is not so painful, it sounds bad but is not, it makes it much easier to bear. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you can grit your teeth and bear the first couple of times you epilate, it becomes much easier as you get used to it, the hair gets weaker and weaker every time you epilate and is removed easier every time. Dont forget the hair grows in cycles so you will have to epilate a few times, possibly every 3-4 days until all the hair is gone. After that it will stay relatively smooth for several weeks. When it does grow back it will come gradually and it will be thinner and softer, there will not be that stubbly feeling as when you shave. You will be able to get away with wearing skirts and having somebody touch your legs even while it is growing back through. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you can bear the pain the first few times, and really give this product a chance you will be so thankful that you did, you will be so rewarded in ways that you probably would not even have noticed before. Just being able to jump into the pool when friends come over, or a spontaneous afternoon at the beach without the headache of having to prepare.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Really the epilator has given me a freedom I have wished for all my life, I am kicking myself that I did not buy it before. It is worth every penny. I could never find the time to go to the salon to get waxed, or justify the expense, and the home kits are awkward and messy, you have to be a double-jointed octopus to get to everywhere that needs waxing, and it would take a lot of boxes and a hell of a lot of time to do a whole 2 legs, bikini and underarms. So I have shaved all my life. There were never any other options, I thought about laser but it is too expensive, time consuming, and I have been told the hairs do grow back. The epilator has been my answer to the eternal hair removal dilema and this particular model is excellent, it has given me my &#x27;hairless dream&#x27;! saved me so much time, and for only $60! Worth 10 stars and then some.</li>
    <li> This was my second edition of a Braun Silk Epil.  My older one (several years old) finally just gave up and quit running.  This one is even better (and I think it is cheaper too!).  I haven&#x27;t used the additional accessories now included, but I find the main product is even easier to handle and works better with less &#x27;pain&#x27; than before (the &#x27;staggered&#x27; tweezers help there).  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a great product for folks who really do have to shave daily and have dark, course leg hair.  If you&#x27;re looking for help, this is it.   I wear capri slacks almost every day, and dresses on Sunday --no pantyhose in this heat!  Having my Silk Epil again has released me from the burden of shaving every day.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yes, the first time is a bit more painful and time consuming,  but it&#x27;s worth it (and not unbearable). It took me about 30 minutes for both legs the first time.  Once you get past the first time, the maintenance mode is a breeze (just don&#x27;t get lazy over the winter months or you&#x27;ll have to start all over!) &lt;br /&gt;I find I need to use mine about twice a week, but it&#x27;s a quick process to catch those few hairs that have sprung up (I have to look for them, though; they&#x27;re hard to &#x27;feel&#x27; when they grow back so much softer!)  I sometimes will shave afterwards just to get a really close, smoothe feel and catch the few stragglers I missed (and the &#x27;fuzz&#x27; above my knee).  But I don&#x27;t even do this weekly, and that&#x27;s a ton better than daily!   I&#x27;d buy this product again--hey, I DID buy it again!  And in a few years when this one poops out, I&#x27;ll be searching on-line for a new one.</li>
    <li> my first silk epil just konked out on me after 10 years.  it has been a wonderful product.  i decided to try to find it again, and found it through amazon.com. it has far exceeded my expectations.  it is 10 times the machine it was 10 years ago.  i would reccommend it to anyone. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Love it. These are very popular in Europe, but hard to find in the U.S. Women should not worry about the minor pain. It is a great alternative to a razor.</li>
    <li> I have become tired of shaving my legs every other day!  I began looking around for a solution to my problem and ran across this Braun Epilator.  I started reading the reviews and was suprised to read so many that spoke so highly of this product.  I decided to go for it.  The evening that it arrived I sat down and read through the instructions, turned it on, and began running it over my leg.  OUCH!  It is kind of a firey feeling.  Slowly and painfully I covered most of my legs....they didn&#x27;t feel quite smooth, but after reading the other reviews I knew it may take more than just one try.  I let a couple of days pass and tried again-not so painful this time-definitely tolerable-and I was begining to feel smoother.  I have owned the epilator for about a month now and I am very pleased.  I really isn&#x27;t painful anymore....hair growth is so sparce.  I try to make a pass over my legs every 3 or 4 days just to catch the few that are growing in.  If you are ever in need to have super super smooth legs then you can simply shave them and they will stay feeling super soft for 2 or 3 days and then you can return back to epilating.  I am glad that I purchased this item...while it won&#x27;t stop me from shaving completely it will definately reduce the amount I do.  Like I said, the first time is very uncomfortable-I would recommend taking some tylenol or ibuprofen about an hour before you plan to start...bite your lip and do it, it will be worth it in the long run.</li>
    <li> I had reservations about buying this, fearing a painful experience, but boy was I wrong.  In fact, having used it now for several months, I&#x27;m hooked for good!</li>
    <li> Works better than expected.  Like the results so far.  More convenient than waxing legs.</li>
    <li> The Braun 3370 was my first foray into the wonderful world of epilating and I must say it was an easy transition from shaving. At first, I thought it would be too difficult to do around the ankles but then I went back and read the instructions a little more closely and realized that there was a better way of doing it. So, read the instructions and enjoy more than one or two days of hairless legs!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It gets a four and not a five because I think it may have also contributed to a higher number of ingrown hairs at first, but I am learning to deal with that as well and it has tapered off.</li>
    <li> I bought the epilator a month ago and never found de courage of using it since yesterday, I only used the sHaver head wich I love And find it great for maintance, since I&#x27;m going on a week long vacation I decided to give the epilator head a try and to my surprise it really wasn&#x27;t that bad and I even removed the massaging head and went to speed 2 and it was still good, so since I was so happy whith the results I decided to try it on my underarms and let me tell you it wasn&#x27;t pretty, it hurted so much that I&#x27;m not planning on using it under my arms any more, whith this little disapoinment, i still went on and used it on my bikini area and even though it was painfull not nearly as close as before, so overall It&#x27;s a great gadget that I intend to  keep using just not in my armpits.</li>
    <li> The first time I got the chance to use Silk Epil was about 4 years ago in Europe. I had to order it form Italy and it cost me about 100 Euros, which lets face it, is a lot of money. I have been looking for this product for the longest time, since the one I have in Europe doesnt work in here. I finally found it here at Amazon and I am VERY happy. It is a little bit painful the first one or two times, but as you use it more and more the hair gets thinner and less painful. I think every girl should own one because it is really a life saver. The redness goes away in a matter of hours. And the best time to use this product is night because when you wake up in the morning and look at your legs they look GREAT...</li>
    <li> I have very dark, thick, fast growing leg hair. On top of that, it&#x27;s awkward for me to shave due to orthopedic problems. I hoped this product would let me shave less often and, with less stubble, would make my large pores less visible. Unfortunately, this has not been the case. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;First, it takes FOREVER to get the best \\&quot;shave\\&quot; from this thing. You have to go over the same area over and over in all different directions. Also, you have to hold it at just the right angle so that the tweezers close at the right point against your skin. This seems simple but isn&#x27;t easy to do as you&#x27;re moving around. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s incredibly frustrating to SEE a hair there, plenty long, and still not have it be pulled after the fifth pass. And that&#x27;s just the long ones--despite what it claims, it&#x27;s not very good at short hairs. Even after going over my legs over and over until I just can&#x27;t do it anymore, they still feel stubbly. And by the next day or so, I have to do it again. Basically it&#x27;s the same results I could get with a cheap electric shaver. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Looking at the design of the tweezing heads on this and the Emjoi, I wish I had bought that one. It just looks more efficient. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the good news side, pain is a non-issue. Yes, you will feel it the first time. Depending on your pain threshold--and how scared of it you are--it will feel somewhere between \\&quot;weird\\&quot; (what I thought) and painful. But after that you are not taking out so many hairs at once and you don&#x27;t even notice it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ironically, the area I have liked it best for is my underarms. I hadn&#x27;t even planned to use it there. Again, the first time through it hurt (yeah, that one actually hurt), but subsequent times were fine. It&#x27;s difficult because skin here is looser and there are lots of nooks and crannies, but once you get the hang of it you actually can get a smooth \\&quot;shave.\\&quot; It&#x27;s important that the skin be BONE dry, though, or else the head will skip over the skin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Forget about the \\&quot;opti-trim\\&quot; attachment. You might as well just throw it out. If it trims your hair at all, it will leave it way too long for comfortable epilating. The shaver head is almost as bad--in fact, I wound up using the shaver head in my underarms before epilating. It left the hair at a good length for that. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I really like the idea of epilating, but not this product. I&#x27;m waiting for it to die (looking at the cheap plastic gear, it should be too long) so I can try the Emjoi.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first time to use epiator and before I use this I sahved and it hurt my skin often. Before I bought this I read all of the customer review and I was kind of afraid about the pain. But it was not that painful at all. I think it&#x27;s depend on the person&#x27;s hair and skin. For me I only use for my leg and it was not painful. It was easy to use for me. I had to go several times again to remove hair perfectly and maybe that&#x27;s why it was not that painful. Because they were not removed at once. Anyway, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this epilator and happy that I don&#x27;t have to shave any more!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my drag show, I represent Tina Turner on the show so I needed smooth legs for this. Is painful but GREAT. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> My previous mode of hair removal was through waxing....waxing, though painless on my hands and legs, used to be a literal torture on my underarms. Also due to the pain could never do it on my own so used to shave...but the results were not the same and also you have to shave every other day. I was on the lookout for an alternate, cheaper, and less painful method of hair removal, especially for my underarms and came across Braun 3370. I must say I am very very happy with the results. The results are way better than shaving; as good as waxing, without the hassles. I am also delighted by the fact that the pain is much lower than waxing and the occasional bleeding that used to occur does not happen and I can do my underarms all by myself (Though it did help that 2 weeks before I used the epilator I had waxed my undearms; so the growth was not as thick and coarse as it is with a razor). Needless to say its great on my hands and legs; quite pain free. I used the pain decreasing attachment only the first time...then stopped it...felt it wasn&#x27;t necessary...In fact it was much better without it at the higher speed...  On a side note, I have noticed that though it plucks out most of the hair, it does tend to clip some of them. Hence, its not as good as waxing in the sense that you do it once and forget about it for 3 weeks. I am right now epilating my underarms once in 10 days...but I am not complaining sure beats the pains of waxing and the lousy results of shaving!!</li>
    <li> This model is a lot better than the previous Braun model (which i used and owned).  Plucks hair cleanly at root and can pluck small hairs, which the older model had difficulty achieving.  The \\&quot;comfor rollers\\&quot; are amazing.  I do not understand how those little things work, but they definitely make the epilating process a much less painful one.  I would recomend this product to anyone who is looking for a quality, superior (and not costly)way to get rid of nasty body hair.  Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> To start i would like to say that this product does hurt to start but the pain does go away as you carry on using the product. Now i know that we have all have different pain barriers but no matter how well you can cope with pain it has to hurt the first time. In saying that i would like to point out the pain is worth it as it is only the first few times of use. I have used it on all areas - legs, underarm &amp; bikini. I no longer have to shave everyday if i want hair free, stuble free legs its brillant i tell you and of course no longer need to shave in the shower and deal with the dreaded razor bump. The first few times that i used the product i did get razor bump but that is just because your skin is not used of this type of treatment however after a few times using this product believe me it does not happen anymore.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The beauty of the product is that if you see a few hairs appearing after a day or two you can just plug in the epilator and away you go. You dont need to wait till all the hair under your arms or legs or bikini are ready to be waxed (maybe approx 3 weeks depending on the person) make the apointment which may be booked up till a weeks times from the time you rang and then pay for the treatment. There is an easier way - the epilator.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To finish one more reason why i strongly recommend this product. We are going on holidays in three weeks (Wohoo cant wait) and the other girls that wax are going through &#x27;dreaded letting the hair grow for the next 3 weeks&#x27; phase and feeling like you have put on a stone in weight due to the hair growth. People you all know how it feels. Where as i can epilate the weekend before i go if i want to wear a strappy top and epilate again the day before i go pure brillance. the girls will have to wear tshirts or long sleeve tops for the next few weeks he he. And of course you can also bring it on holidays with you and not need to worry about messy wax strips sticking to everything. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My last fewwords - about time you might be saying - Remember to use an intensive moisturiser as with any hair removal treatment your legs will appear dry and remember if you have been working on a tan before holidays as i have been the epilator will not do any damage to the tan as it is not removing any layers of skin where as waxing and shaving will or so i have been told. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Go out there and buy it withstand the pain cause it does go away over time (short period of time i might add)and moisturise. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Have fun</li>
    <li> My previous epilator broke after 6 years of use, so I had to get a new one... this new version is pretty good, but I found that my previous epilator (Silk Epil, Braun) was slightly better.</li>
    <li> excellent. easy to use, doesn&#x27;t hurt too badly, and is effective in removing all hairs---got more out that doing a traditional wax, and it&#x27;s economical too-the price of the braun is less than the price of a leg wax in new york city.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;enjoy!</li>
    <li> Wonderful epilator.  This is the FIRST TIME i have ever used an epilator and it is wonderful.  I have very dark and coarse hair and it comes off very easily, that is, when it is the right length.  To me, it did not hurt much at all.  It feels as if you are getting a wax or plucking.  In my opinion, tweezing hurts much much more.  The epilator yanks the hairs out much more faster and easier.  I have tried many forms of hair removal methods on my legs and this is the best one yet.  I recommend this product very much to anyone in need of it.  I call this a product in need due to many problems i have had with hair growth on my legs.  No one likes hair on their legs and by using this product the hair is removed quickly.  You will be left with redness on the areas used but that goes away within a couple of hours.  To everyone, i RECOMMEND.  Excellent product!!!!!  Very happy customer...FINALLY A PRODUCT THAT WORKS!!!!</li>
    <li> I am simply amazed by the results... and the pain is not that bad.  I did read all of the reviews and that is why I feel I should right one (I do appreciate them and come here first before making purchases).  My legs have never been smoother and silkier... My recommendations are start up near the knee on the lower portion of your leg (don&#x27;t venture down to the ankle until you are comfortable with the feel).  The top of your legs will be breeze.  I do recommend shaving (or waxing if you can) and then as soon as you see a few hairs come in, epilate them.  Do not wait until all your hairs are visible... (it will be more uncomforatable).  Also, keep epilating every other day or so, as you see hairs... they hardly come in at all and they are virtually painless to remove.  I&#x27;ve even done my bikini area (more difficult, but not unbearable).  I started on the underarms, and that has been the \\&quot;most\\&quot; difficult... and I&#x27;m doing it in stages.  (I shaved, then as some hair comes in, I grit my teeth and epilate it.)  This is my second attempt at the underarms... the first time, I tried it on the second day of growth, but I had too much hair and it was too difficult, so I decided to shave and epilate the very next day ... and do it daily to get the new growth.  My legs are completely accustomed after only three uses.  My underarms, however, may require more time.  At any rate, I truly love the epilator!</li>
    <li> I have been really happy with the Braun Epilator.  The first time was a bit uncomfortable but the results were worth it.  Once every other week I do a touch-up on my legs that takes just a few minutes but I love not having to shave my legs anymore. It leaves my legs very smooth for weeks! I did my bikini-line as well but it was too uncomfortable to do my armpits.  I would recommend this product to anyone that hates shaving and can&#x27;t afford to have a professional wax job done all the time.</li>
    <li> I recently had to purchase a new epilator since my old one finally died after about 10 years of use. The new one is so much better. I should have upgraded years ago. It comes with all kinds of attachments - pretty neat. I&#x27;d recommend it in a heartbeat!</li>
    <li> I am extremely satisfied with my new Braun 3370. It works better than previous Braun models and it is more efficient. It can be used almost all over your body... my legs feel nice now for a longer time and even my bikini line suffered great improvements. It is worth it every penny!</li>
    <li> Well, it does a great job and and my wife&#x27;s loving it. She likes this better than the older norelco one and the disposable razers. I am a big fan of Norelco shavers... I guess since my wife has no experience with what ever the latest &amp; greatest Norelco epilator she thinks the braun is the greatest.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On major flaw though is that it does not have a rechargable battery like the men&#x27;s shavers. Need to have it plugged in to use it.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried about the pain that may be involved.  But it&#x27;s not so bad...depending on where you use it.  Legs are no problem.  Even bikini line wasn&#x27;t bad.  My friend said it well when she reminded me that the first time I plucked my eyebrows tears ran down my face and now I barely feel them. And I didn&#x27;t think that it was nearly as bad as the first eyebrow tweezing incident. Maybe I&#x27;m tougher now. &lt;br /&gt;Anyway I think it is a lot better than shaving, and I have no compliants about the Braun 3370.  It is a great product.</li>
    <li> I have had different epilators for the past ten years but the Braun 3370 is by far the best. Not only does it actually pull out even the shortest hairs but it is also relatively pain free. Probably the best investment I have made all year!</li>
    <li> I held off on writing this review until I&#x27;d been using the silk epil for a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I wasn&#x27;t very happy with it. It seemed to break quite a few hairs instead of getting them out at the root, leaving my legs feeling rough. After using it patiently for quite a while, and after reading some tips from other reviewers here, I got the hang of it, and I&#x27;m happy to report that my legs are now as smooth as they ever were after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really important to go slow, and to hold the silk epil at a 90 degree angle. Also, if you have sensitive skin, as I do, you&#x27;ll have some icky bumps after epilating--try to do it right before bed so your legs can recover overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My most important discovery was that the silk epil works MUCH more efficiently without either of the snap-on guards, and really isn&#x27;t much more painful. I&#x27;ve never had it pinch my skin at all. You&#x27;d have to really jam it into some loose skin, I imagine, for it to pinch you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as pain goes, it really wasn&#x27;t bad. The first time, when you have tons of hair on your legs, is always the worst, but if you do regular touch-ups, you&#x27;ll hardly feel a thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use the silk epil on my legs; I tried it on my underarms, but the pain was really bad, and it left a terrible rash (I have the world&#x27;s most sensitive skin; it may work for other people). And I refuse to even think about using it anywhere else. Yikes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up, the silk epil has a high learning curve and it takes a bit of patience and experimentation to get the results you want, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it once you do.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I am sick and tired of shaving.  It was getting to expensive to buy quality razors, and it has recently become more dangerous for me because I only have a stand up shower. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was a little nervous about using the product at first, but it really wasn&#x27;t that bad.  There is some pain, don&#x27;t get me wrong, the first thing that I thought of was getting a new tattoo (this is not as bad, but it is the only thing I can compare it to).  It hurt, and it was a constant pain, but after a while it really wan&#x27;t that bad. I think that I need to wait a little longer for the hair to grow out before I use it again, but other than that it appears to be very affective.  I used it on my legs, bikini area, and underarms.  The worst was under the arms!  I wanted to quit right away, but stuck with it even with the tears.  I do plan on still using it under my arms though because I hate armpit stubble, I think it is gross.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it seems to be really loud.  I have read other review that say that it is quieter than other, but it was pretty loud in my house.  Good Luck!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I had purchased another model of the Silk Epil Epilator at least 5 years ago, and while I liked that one very much, this one is much better.  It practically doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, and it&#x27;s much quieter to use.  I have no critical comments at all about this product.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Okay...I bought this item very excitedly after reading all the wonderful reviews. I have had it for about 2 months now and have found that it is not as fantastic as most of the reviews indicate.    First of all...IT HURTS LIKE HELL THE FIRST TIME! I don&#x27;t care what other people say about the pain being \\&quot;bearable\\&quot;. They&#x27;ve GOT to be kidding me! Imagine getting your legs waxed for the first time but the waxer decides to be cute and pulls off the strip in slow motion. The pain is worse than this. And it took FOREVER the first time. I could not go slow because it hurt too freakin&#x27; much. So I had to keep going back over the spots that I missed. I was sweating like a crazy person by the time I finished about 45 minutes later (and that was just the bottom half of my legs). I did the top half the next day which hurt even worse, but I finished. I was not able to get all the hairs out no matter how hard I tried and my legs were not completely smooth but I thought that this was because it was the first time I used it. My legs looked like I had some incurable disease after the whole process and the disease lasted for about 36 hours.    Okay...I gave it another week and a half and tried again. Still hurt, but not like hell. Again, I still did not have smooth legs afterwards. I was still willing to give it a try. I waited 2 more weeks to make sure all the hairs grew back in and I tried again. The hurt factor was lessening but still...no smooth legs. And it still took FOREVER.    I took other reviewers advice and exfoliated before and after the process the next few times I used it and still...NO SMOOTH LEGS! I go very slow and try to get everything but it just does not seem possible to me.    So, my advice is the following: if you are impatient, have a low tolerance for pain, or want completely smooth legs...this product is NOT for you. Furthermore, if you do decide to purchase it, do so in the winter to give your legs a chance to adjust because you should not count on wearing shorts for a few days after you use it for the first 2 times.     I am still giving it a chance as I definitely see an improvement in the texture of the hair (it is much lighter and less noticeable when it grows back). In fact, noone will really notice that your legs aren&#x27;t completely smooth unless they get as close to you as only your significant other would. I have been married for 5 years now and don&#x27;t care if my legs aren&#x27;t completely smooth to the touch and neither does my husband. That&#x27;s good enough for me.    I gave the product 3 stars because it takes too long and doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs. I would have given it 3 1/2 but Amazon won&#x27;t let me.    Good luck!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to waxing, but can&#x27;t do it since I moved to the US and don&#x27;t know where there would be a good place to do so. It has a lot of features, isn&#x27;t that painful and enables me to remove my hairs whenever I want as I have a busy schedule. The razor part is good too, although I don&#x27;t use it that much. &lt;br /&gt;In summary, it&#x27;s a good product to use, easy to carry around.</li>
    <li> I had never epilated before I bought this gadget, but I was *so sick* of shaving.  My skin is pretty sensitive so I always have razor burn, which made me just want to wear pants all the time to avoid the razor! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the Silk Epil, I will confess, was pretty painful (I had never waxed my legs before, mostly because I am a wimp).  I got out my favorite movie and watched it to distract myself for as long as I could stand to epilate.  It took me several days of short episodes to complete the whole process--BUT the first time on each leg was the worst (taking ibuprofen beforehand helped).  I think it had to do with the density of hair; once I went back and started \\&quot;cleaning up\\&quot; rather than doing the whole leg at once, it was much, much less painful--just a little pulling.  And oh, the hairlessness!  It&#x27;s a wonderful thing, especially when it lasts for a few weeks. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There have been mixed reviews about the pain-relieving head; I really like it.  The longer I keep the epilator in continuous contact with my skin, the more it helps.  Also, I like the razor head; I haven&#x27;t been brave enough yet to try epilating near the bikini line, but the razor head shaves satisfactorily without giving me razor burn. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be recommending this item to friends!</li>
    <li> I love my silk epil. I have owned and used this for 7 years and it still works great.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the product.  I have an older Epilady model epilator that I use occasionally - I&#x27;ll never use it again.  The Braun is painless in comparison.  &lt;br /&gt;Initially, upon my first use, I thought it wasn&#x27;t working.  I did not really feel anything (again, I was accustomed to the much more painful Epilady).  I looked closely and could tell that it was removing hairs.  Soon, I found I could remove the massaging attachment.  Without the attachment, I felt more of a pricking sensation, but it was manageable.  I felt more sensations in the ankle, toe, knee, and forearm region.  In an hour and a half, I epilated both legs and both arms.  &lt;br /&gt;I also should add that I waxed my lower legs a few weeks prior to my first use.  I think that helped the speed up the process.&lt;br /&gt;My only disappointment is that I still feel a slight stubble on my lower legs (no where else).</li>
    <li> I first ordered the Emjoi Gold Caress, which I found too curved to reach all areas.&lt;br /&gt;The Braun clearly does not have this problem, and reaches even incredibly short hairs.  It does not seem to have as strong a motor  as the Emjoi, but I am not sure that matters, because it does an excellent job.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, for the same price, you get a shaver-trimmer, which is necessary for those longer hairs.&lt;br /&gt;This one is a keeper, and it comes highly recommnded.</li>
    <li> I was tired of razor burn, shaving everyday, and still having stubbly legs!  I start going to the spa to get waxed...well that didn&#x27;t fit my budget for very long.  I started waxing at home, which was a long, messy process.  On a search of something else to get rid of hair, I came across this product on Amazon and bought it.  This is my first epilator and now I wonder why I&#x27;ve taken so long to get one!  I agree with one of the other reviews that it&#x27;s important to get waxed a few times before you use the epilator, especially if you have course hair.  (It gets you use to the sensation and damages the bulb which prevents the hair from growing as fast and thick.)  Epilating and waxing are UNCOMFORTABLE (however the more you do it the less discomfort you will have), there&#x27;s no way around that, but you can handle it!  Especially when the results are to be hair free for a few weeks!  Follow the instructions when using the epilator (start epilating at the ankle, the most senitive part, and work your way up.).  It still takes awhile to remove all the hair but it&#x27;s much more convenient than waxing (and cheaper in the long run).  I highly recommend this product.  The epilator comes with a shaver and a cute carrying case so it&#x27;s easy to take with you when you travel!  I will NEVER shave again!</li>
    <li> I searched for the latest Braun epilator and bought this last month.  This is exellent.  Ive tried everything shaving, tweezing, waxing and epilating. I&#x27;ll tell you Braun 3370 is really efficient. Its fast, doesnt leave a hair behind, and is far less pain. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I should tell you, Ive used an older model of Braun Silk epil.  I bought it in July 1998 and had been using that till last month. To tell you the truth it was painful but bearable (Hey! pullilng  hair at root is supposed to be painful).  another glich was it cant pick up very small hairs, but it was the best thing when I bought it.  I have pulled 6yrs out of it and that was one of the reason why I was looking for another Braun epilator. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This 3370 is really good theyve over come all the negatives in their older models. I would say its very very very less pain than I expected and it pulls out even the shortest hairs and the extra shaver head is exellent. Im sure Ill be happy I bought this for another 6yrs or more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you have decided on buying an Epilator, Id say Look no more! This is THE ONE &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This is the best!!! I have tried a lot of thinks wax, shave, creams and much more this product has changed my life.</li>
    <li> This is just what I expected because pain in hair removal is less as compared to waxing and hairs are removed from the root.</li>
    <li> In reading the reviews here I noticed a lot of ladies are saying they don&#x27;t get a smooth feeling after using the epilator.  If you have a \\&quot;stubbly\\&quot; feeling ladies, your hair was too long and intstead of being pulled out it was broken off at the surface of your skin.  If you&#x27;ve waited a while before epilating, you may want to trim your hair a bit.  Or you can do what I do and go over your legs with the epilator again 1 week later.  You&#x27;ll be surprised at the results. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, to combat ingrown hairs, use a good loofa every day.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. Good results with very little pain. I will never shave again.</li>
    <li> This is a great, reliable, easy to use epilator.  The attachments make it much less painful than previous models.  It would be nice if the European version with all attachments such as shaving head were available in the U.S., and if this model would have dual voltage for travel.  Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine introduced me to an older model of the Silk Epil. I was hesitant, given my painful memories of the Epilady (remember that painful gadget?), but loved it because it plucked out all the hairs out of my legs. So, I decided to invest in this model and love it!  I highly recommend it, especially if you&#x27;re too lazy to shave your legs every other day and especially if your boyfriend hates stubbly legs!</li>
    <li> Very good.I have been using it for 2 years now and it works great.Somehting I would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I bought this product many years ago and I still using it. I love it! I don&#x27;t have to shave any more and the hair doesn&#x27;t grow as fast as it used to when I used to shave.</li>
    <li> Let yourself swear - because it&#x27;s going to hurt.  I used every 4-letter word I know and even made up a few new ones while using this sadistic little gadget.  The good news is, hair doesn&#x27;t grow back for at least 2 weeks.  I didn&#x27;t find epilation on the legs to be particularly painful except for my ankles.  Using this product on the bikini area or underarms is so painful that I don&#x27;t recommend trying it.  Also, make sure you exfoliate often to prevent ingrown hairs - they can get very irritated.  With all these complaints, it may seem strange that I give this product a 4-star rating.  It does do what&#x27;s promised, and I can&#x27;t really ask for anything more.</li>
    <li> I used it for underarms, and it was totally bearable when I was epilating, but I felt burns in my underarms after several hours. The second morning, I found redness and small scar-looking spots there but all the pains were gone. I&#x27;ll continue trying it and I hope I&#x27;ll get used to it after the second time.</li>
    <li> I have been very impressed with this Epilator thus far, I can say that it takes some practice though. My hair is very fine, but there is a lot of it and it grows very fast! I have used the Braun on my legs, underarms and bikini area successfully, however I am still working on getting it all in one try - so far it&#x27;s taken several evenings to get all the hairs, but I think with continued use it will be easier. I&#x27;m still getting used to the product. Going slow is definitely the key! I also found exfoliating helped on my legs. The pain was very minimal on my legs, everywhere else - just grit your teeth and bear it the first few times and then you&#x27;re good to go...</li>
    <li> I have used epilators for about 25 years and the Braun seems to be the absolute best.  This one is nice because it is also for underarms and bikini areas.  If you have a low tolerance to pain this product probably wouldn&#x27;t work because there is a little discomfort at first.</li>
    <li> Braun products are simply the best...! &lt;br /&gt;This epilator is an investment you would never regret...it works and its convenient.  Don&#x27;t waste money on any other epilator.. Brauns technology for reducing pain during epilation is simply perfect.  Other brand epilators don&#x27;t even try to reduce pain.  You can tell by even looking at the epilator that its of high quality and would last for decades...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 3 months now, and couldn&#x27;t be happier!  I only have to use it once a week, and presto! my legs look and feel great.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Regarding the ever-so-sensitive underarm area: it&#x27;s definently worth the pain.  I used to shave only two or three times a year, and that at great deliberation, because I would get horrible itchy rashes (yuck) and painful bumps that would last days.  Now I epilate once a week, with almost no problems.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What a relief that someone invented this!</li>
    <li> Definitely have to go with the Braun Epilator... NOT EPILADY!  It works... much better than waxing... much neater &amp; quicker.  Just have to get used to the PULLING sensation!  One hair at a time... I use it on my arms &amp; toes.  ew.  Lasts longer than waxing &amp; you can use it when the hairs are VERY short.  Also has an electric razor attachment with a guard.  GREAT!  Easy to clean.  Great quality.  GET IT!!  Doesn&#x27;t really leave red marks afterwards, like I thought it would.</li>
    <li> I am fully satisfied with the product &amp; also the status for delivery was showing after 15days but i got it in 3 days.I am happy to make decision bying it from amazon</li>
    <li> It does work and it does seem to pull the hair -however short it is- from its roots. The shaver head works better but hair grows back faster this way. It&#x27;s OK but not the best epilation product I&#x27;ve ever used. I used to have Epilady by Braun which worked much better. Neither the \\&quot;4-way moving pain softener\\&quot; nor the \\&quot;efficiency pro clip\\&quot; is necessary for me. Being used to hot wax I don&#x27;t feel pain. Without the pain softener gadget it still does not hurt at all (experience based on legs only). I only wish Silk Epil were more powerful. You need to go either very slowly or go over the same place several times. Despite all the negative things I wrote it is the best product I found in the market. Let me know if you find something better. Carrying pouch is stylish and is handy to keep all the pieces together.</li>
    <li> I would sugest waxing at least once before using this product because it takes away almost all of the pain. I tried it before waxing and it really hurt. After I waxed, it didn&#x27;t really hurt at all. It&#x27;s nice not having to shave every day!</li>
    <li> This item is great especially if you are a hairy monkey like myself. This product is able to pull out my dark, coarse hair without a hitch.  The first use definitely hurts but the pain lessens with each use.  The only negative is that I seem to have more ingrown hairs than I did w/ shaving.  I&#x27;m also still a tad nervous to use it on my armpits.  Overall, a really great product that I wish I had purchased sooner.</li>
    <li> I am quite active in sports/bicycling and find the massive amounts of chest hair I have to be a nuisance as well as I enjoy a smooth chest and, during cycle season, smooth legs. I have tried laser treatments that were partially successful, but the hair is still thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was tired of shaving and thought I would give these epilator things a try. I tried the Emjoi AP-9GAR Gently Gold Caress which was not too comfortable and only partially effective. I thought I would try this one just to see if the \\&quot;4-way pulsating pain softener stimulates the skin to offset the pulling sensation\\&quot; actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does. This is a great device for removing hair. It is not pain free, but, it does not hurt nearly as much as the Emjoi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So 5 stars because it makes the most of an otherwise painful situation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Update] I gave up on these types of epilators long ago.  Tried several things like the No-No, which also did not work.  Finally I found the SensEpil which, like the Remington model, uses \\&quot;laser\\&quot; (IPL) technology and actually works, though slowly.</li>
    <li> I purchased this about a year ago and mainly bought it because I was going on a cruise for my anniversary and really didn&#x27;t want to be shaving everyday before I put on a swimsuit. I read many reviews and thought this would be the best option. These are my thoughts and opinions on its performance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The pain is tolerable. The intial hair pull it the worst of them all. After a few seconds, I became comfortable and did not notice much discomfort or an increase in pain...until the start of the next leg and then it starts all over again briefly. My tolerance for pain is pretty high and I have waxed my legs before. I think waxing might be more painful because it pulls on the skin, too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The removal of hair is okay. Not what I was expecting based on the reviews I had read. I have fine, blonde hair on my legs and about 50% of the hairs were pulled out and the remaining 50% were broken off close to the skin. To get a smooth shave I have to use the shaving attachment or a regular razor. It does work better on thicker, more coarse hair. I used it on my bikini line and did not have any problems with hair removal...and yes, the pain does greatly increase in that area. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The process is very time consuming because you have to go slowly or you miss several hairs or they snap off instead of pulling them out.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The increase in ingrown hairs is great but understandable. You must scrub and exfoliate daily while in the shower or bath to avoid that problem. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would not buy this product again but, I still use it periodically to minimize the amount of regular shaving I have to do while in the shower.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over6 years and it&#x27;s been really good. I especially like that it has a replaceable head with multi function.</li>
    <li> Does not have a battery recharger, so need to use it along with the power cable</li>
    <li> This is my second epilator, I definitely recommend it because it is very useful and gentle. It dosen&#x27;t hurt and removes hairs very quickly without problem. It feels very smooth and soft, I used to wax and feeling exactly same very soft, and very fast to get rid of all hairs, trust me it is a great product!!!! Dont wait, order now!!!</li>
    <li> After reading reviews and wanting a hair removal system that I could use on my bikini line, underarms and legs without shaving or going to the salon for waxing, I purchased this item yesterday. Beacuse I had already shaved my legs before purchasing, I was unable to test it on my legs, but I did do it on my bikini line. I have very course dark hair on my bikini area and I have been shaving for a few weeks because I have been taking my 7 month old daughter to waterbabies classes. I put a cold ice pack on the area before starting off about 30-40 seconds and then I started. My area was already short due to last weeks shaving. As I went over the bikini area I was surprised at how little pain their was. It was like a litte pinch, but it subsided as I went along. Now the area is smooth excpet for some ingrown hairs I had to take out with tweezers because of the shaving. The after effect was redness and the feeling I just had a waxing. No pain or anything. I have tried other epilators in the past and they all went back. This one I am keeping. I will have to try it on my legs and underarms when the hair begins to grow back from shaving. This is fantastic. All ladies should try it. Just remember, in the bikini area, make sure you use the trimmier attachment to make he hairs less dense. Also try the ice if you are very sensitive to pain. I will update my review in a couple of weeks when I get to try my legs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I used to use wax strips to wax my legs, which were relatively fast and easy. Until I found my SilkEpil. The first time I used it I didn&#x27;t even try it with the head which supposedly makes it less painful, because I am used to waxing. I was a little shocked by the pain at first, but quickly got used to it, and by the end of the session it was more like a warm sensation with no pain. I then tried it on my bikini line with the head to reduce pain. I have since decided never to try it again. Waxing is equally painful, but lasts half-a-second, where this takes 5 minutes to do a couple square inches. Very uncomfortable, I didn&#x27;t even finish. However, it also comes with a shaver head which is very convenient. (you can trim your bikini hair to half a centimeter) I did both of my lower legs in 20 minutes on the first time, and have been quicker since. It also takes only a couple minutes to clean it. WELL WORTH THE MONEY. I was spending much more for the wax strips. (which are about 6 bucks per waxing, which is a fraction of the cost for professional waxing). Another benefit to this over waxing is that the hair doesn&#x27;t have to be as long for it to be effective. Which is a major perk to my husband, because I don&#x27;t have to go as long with gorilla legs.&lt;br /&gt;*update*&lt;br /&gt;I now only use the shaver head, because I was getting way too many ingrown hairs when I used the epilator. Now I just shave my legs like the regular girls. :) Also, my sister tried this product and she couldn&#x27;t bare the pain for even an inch of her legs.</li>
    <li> Ok, I just bought this baby about a month ago, and here&#x27;s my official opinion.  A bit about me: never waxed before, lots of dark, coarse leg hair.  My thoughts: &lt;br /&gt;1.  If you haven&#x27;t waxed, the first time you use this thing it hurts like the dickens.  Quite painful.. took me probably 4 hours to do both legs, and I used the Bactine recommended plus drank.  :)  People thought I was crazy.  &lt;br /&gt;2.  But, it&#x27;s been worth it.  I LOVE not having to shave frequently, especially since within 12 hours I was stubbly when I shaved.  It does hurt significantly less the second time, if for no other reason that you have less hair (it doesn&#x27;t all grow back simultaneously).  You really won&#x27;t care about the pain, or feel it anymore, after a few times.     &lt;br /&gt;3.  Listen to the people who say to exfoliate!! Buy a loofah, do this frequently.  I got quite a few ingrown hairs, because I only exfoliating every 3-4 days.  Do it as often as you can.     &lt;br /&gt;4.  It does work, it&#x27;ll remove the hair, no problem.   &lt;br /&gt;5.  To make it less painful, keep your skin taught.  That made the pain much less than the bactine.  Especially important if you&#x27;re doing the upper legs.   &lt;br /&gt;6.  I actually found the bikini area less painful than my legs... but I only did up to, say, the underwear line and no further.  Pull skin very taught.  Also make sure to trim this area first so the hair isn&#x27;t too long. &lt;br /&gt;7.  After your first time, remove the pain head, especially if you&#x27;re trying to get some ingrown hairs out.  A little closer, it&#x27;ll grab a few more.  &lt;br /&gt;Have fun with this... it&#x27;s fabulous.  Love it.   &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice since buying it, and am pretty disappointed. I got used to the pain, but it took hours just to do (most of) my legs, because you have to go so slow. Additionally, I noticed that both times I had stubble the next day, which indicates that it is merely breaking some of the hair off at the skin, not taking out the bulb. So it takes a comparatively huge amount of time and is less effective than shaving or waxing. I would recommend waxing, and then using the epilator to get the hairs that waxing missed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d had an older version of this - which worked out, but of course hurt to use. I&#x27;d long since lost the power chord for it - and couldn&#x27;t find one that would work for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read a bit that suggests removing hair from the root over a period of time will eventually lessen the hair that grows back - plus shaving still leaves a dark shadow on my skin since my body hair is dark and my skin is pale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this model from Braun a try, after waxing my legs using Moom - the theory that If I can get a decent portion of hair removed initially, then using the epil will be fairly painless. I found its easier to do the wax thing and get huge sections taken care of at once, then to go over everything with just the epil soft all at once. So that worked, and I noticed that this epil wasn&#x27;t as painful to use as the old one - plus it has some new neat attachment gadgets that came in handy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided - well, Lets try the underarms - I&#x27;ve never used anything but a razor before to remove hair from the underarms, and was a bit nervous to try - but I gave it a shot... yeah - it hurts, but not unbearably - I&#x27;d shaved the day before, and the epil was able to pick up a one day stubble - but, also due to shaving, the hair is still picking its time to grow back - so am using the epil a bit each day and the hair is almost all gone now  - each morning the growing in stubble is less and less - so once my under arms are completely hair free, there will be no more dark shadow either! And, this will make it relatively easy to care for if I stick with it to maintain the hair free-ness. Same with the legs and bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from permanently removing hair via laser surgery, I think a combo of Moom waxing and using this epilator is the best way go go (and no more razor burn either!)</li>
    <li> I purchased this epilator a few weeks ago.  I used it the day I got it.  Yes, it was a little uncomfortable to begin with, but it is very much worth the discomfort.  I have had to use it a couple of time, because I found that I missed a few spots, and its great.  I also used it on my arm pits, and I have never felt so good about wearing a sleeveless shirt as I do now.  It is as clear as ever.  I absoulty love this product, and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a very good epilator, before I used to afraid of using them because of the sound the epilators make. This is a very good friend of mine. The only problem is that it caused ingrown hair.</li>
    <li> I have always shaved and living in a hot State always in shorts, so just about every other day, out came the razor. My girlfriend recommended me to epilate, although she warned me it could be a bit painful.  I brought this item based on previous reviews and used it 2 weeks ago. For the first time, I would not say it was painful, quite bearable and my skin got used to it pretty quickly.  Only now, 2 weeks later, hairs have come through but so much lighter. I can imagine it only getting better the more I use it and the interval of time inbetween also.  Good bye razor.....I love this.</li>
    <li> This improved silk epil model is painless and really lets your skin softer. I&#x27;ve been using this hair removal system for many years now and I can say that in a long term, the hair quantity and tickness will decline. Shaving removes even the very thin hairs, but the problem is that the hair will start crowing faster and from the ticker part, making it more visible, the same happens with depilation products. So, for me Silk epil system is the best! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> So, the free shiping option was very cool. But it turned out that I had to wait two weeks for my item to arrive.  &lt;br /&gt;That wasn&#x27;t so bad since the item was in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> My sister and I bought each other epils for Christmas.  I have had it for three months, and I have used it three times.  Here is the ugly, the bad, and the good: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ugly: &lt;br /&gt;*Like after waxing, there will be red little bumps on your legs for about 24 hours. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bad: &lt;br /&gt;*Epilating hurts, but I got used to it. &lt;br /&gt;*Epilating takes a fair amount of time.  It takes me about 2 hours to do legs and bikini line.  I usually shave during the week and use the epil for special occasions. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Good: &lt;br /&gt;*The hair grows back very slowly.  For my sister and I, it takes about two weeks to grow back.  This really comes in handy when we are going on vacation.  We epil a couple of days before vacation, and then we don&#x27;t have to shave our legs the WHOLE VACATION!!! &lt;br /&gt;*The shaver head is very useful for other areas (let your imagination go :-) &lt;br /&gt;*Unlike waxing, there is no nasty wax everywhere &lt;br /&gt;*It&#x27;s very sturdy.  It seems like it will last for a long time. &lt;br /&gt;*It&#x27;s very well designed.  I give it five stars for ease of use. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars instead of five because of two drawbacks, the pain and the time it takes.  However, if you wax at home, this is a million times better!!</li>
    <li> I have low tolerance for pain, that&#x27;s why I put off getting an epilator for long time. After I tried an epilator once, I thought it was not for me - too painful. A few years later, as I got tired of time-consuming and short-lasting shaving, messy waxing once in a while, I decided to give an epilator another shot...     Yes, it does not feel like you are getting a massage, but it IS bearable even for me with low tolerance for pain. You get used to it and after a while it does not hurt as much, just a little, plus - as opposite from shaving - your get less hair that grows back - at least that&#x27;s how it works for me.   Now I do not worry about waking up with prickly stubble after shaving it clean just 8 hours ago - not a very romantic feeling.    A few smaller hair do stay - to get a complete sleek surface you are better with a razor (which I use sometimes), but I&#x27;m happy with the results I get from this epilator - it saves me a lot of time and does the job.     I hope this feedback will be helpful for some of you ladies, and you need to try it to decide if it is good for you. I&#x27;m so glad i gave it a try.</li>
