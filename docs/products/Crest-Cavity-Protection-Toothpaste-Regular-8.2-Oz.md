      <li>Was nice to get a package of 6</li>
      <li>I have used this kind of Crest tp since childhood (better part of 40 yrs) and love it!</li>
      <li>done the natural (remineralized) way. :D</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve re-oriented my view of dental products and now just go with the tried and true good products (Closys, Crest, Listerine, ACT flouride).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a great, slightly rough feeling texture that makes your mouth feel great, whereas most toothpastes are very smooth.</li>
      <li>huge toothpaste!  </li>
      <li>Each one of these tubes is freaking huge, and there is SIX of them!  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s my favorite toothpaste.</li>
      <li>my favorite flavor.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still my favorite.</li>
      <li>it is a better price</li>
      <li>So, you end up using more tooth paste with this item.</li>
      <li>I doubt Crest will prevent cavities, better than flossing.</li>
      <li>Popular and original tooth creme for your &amp;#34;twice a day&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Pretty good price here on amazon, as well, the 8 pack.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon for having it available at a great price.</li>
      <li>Great old fashioned toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Today I now breath easy, and the nightmares of bacteria crashing parties in my mouth are all but gone.</li>
      <li>It was fine</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried others but Crest works fine.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t beat the cheap price and it tastes just fine.</li>
      <li>This Crest toothpaste is all a toothpaste should be - it leaves my teeth feeling clean and slick, and the taste is very pleasant.</li>
      <li>Good enough.</li>
      <li>(free) right to my door.</li>
      <li>Everything you need for healthy teeth--a basic paste without all the added junk in many others--and fluoride to prevent cavities.</li>
      <li>I like the minty fresh flavor that this has too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not too &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; --- just the right amount of mint.</li>
      <li>It involves 4 steps the second one being using this toothpaste after making sure your brush is thoroughly disinfected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Why put extra chemicals into your mouth when good old fashioned Crest toothpaste does the job with no problems and no unnecessary ingredients.</li>
      <li>This is also the large tubes.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how toothpaste gets 5 stars except by being super tasty, this is regular mint so not so exciting.</li>
      <li>Since the brushing is what removes the food particles and plaque buildup, the toothpastes main job is to lay down the fluoride which CCP does nicely.</li>
      <li>I really hope they never stop making it.</li>
      <li>The tubes are larger than I expected so a good deal.  </li>
      <li>It is too &#x27;watery&#x27; and seems diluted, and gave an overall sweet aftertaste.</li>
      <li>In order to get the same bubbling/thickness in the mouth, you&#x27;d have to use more than double the amount you&#x27;d use for Colgate&#x27;s normal &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>Following these steps in this exact order has really helped my teeth.</li>
      <li>They are a lot less sensitive, my gums are looking better and brown stains are disappearing.</li>
      <li>I look forward to solid white and strong teeth</li>
      <li>Others with new additives may be touted but results don&#x27;t lie....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been following Dr. Ellie&#x27;s \\&quot;Kiss your dentist goodbye\\&quot; teeth whitening program since Feb 1, 2013 when I first got my package of items in the mail including this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>There were uninvited guests taking part of this feast living directly in my mouth.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not like the normal white paste.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It wasn&#x27;t too surprising but disappointing none the less to learn that most dental products on the market are not only all hype, but can actually damage your teeth.</li>
      <li>Love this toothpaste because it doesn&#x27;t contain the fifty billion other things that a lot of toothpastes do these days that simply add nothing but wearing down your enamel.</li>
      <li>Generally I don&#x27;t overthink it with toothpaste</li>
      <li>Colgate&#x27;s normal &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; is like the traditional white paste you&#x27;d expect.  </li>
      <li>This is not one of those.&lt;br /&gt;These days, it&#x27;s hard to find just plain old tp - the kind that just gives you cavity protection, not wakes you up in the morning with a 7 course meal prepared.</li>
      <li>seemed much thinner than the other versions with the Scope stripe.  </li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ll just steer clear of the Regular in the future.</li>
      <li>Personally that&#x27;s what I like-the very fresh, thick consistency in the mouth.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;ll eat off your table and then crap acid all over the place which causes those beautiful pearly whites to start decaying.  </li>
      <li>For really whitening teeth, I use a little baking soda.</li>

<li> however I&#x27;ll be giving at least a couple away to the local food shelf.</li>
<li> but this stuff is so runny, I&#x27;d say that 6 times out of 10 it drips down my arm or onto the sink/floor.  </li>
<li> It taste bland with a bit of sweetness.</li>
<li> Some things you can buy the knockoff brand with little difference in quality.</li>
<li> I see no difference besides this brand of toothpaste and other toothpaste I have used in the past except the price.</li>
<li> Little</li>
<li> I know, I&#x27;ll make up a little story about</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Each one of these tubes is freaking huge, and there is SIX of them!  It is anti-cavity which means using it should keep my teeth in tact and cavity-less.  I like the minty fresh flavor that this has too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else can I say?  It is toothpaste!  I know, I&#x27;ll make up a little story about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twas a long day and due to the stressfulness of it I decided to indulge in all kinds of foods and drink.  Little did I know that I wasn&#x27;t just feeding myself delicious sugars and carbs.  There were uninvited guests taking part of this feast living directly in my mouth.  These intruders call themselves bacteria and they have been known to move into your mouth and just trash the place.  They&#x27;ll eat off your table and then crap acid all over the place which causes those beautiful pearly whites to start decaying.  Before you know it they&#x27;ll have holes in them!  However, I was saved this evening by a hero that dubs itself Crest Anti-Cavity.  He showed up to the bacteria party and kicked them out!  I could hear the death wails of the bacteria as they choked and coughed on the crest fumes.  My teeth rejoiced as the crest also began to wash away the acids and begin the restoring process.  Today I now breath easy, and the nightmares of bacteria crashing parties in my mouth are all but gone.</li>
    <li> Whenever in doubt about which type of toothpaste or which brand, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this. Sometimes I wish the manufactuer would label this as &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; Crest so I don&#x27;t get confused about which Crest to buy.</li>
    <li> I see no difference besides this brand of toothpaste and other toothpaste I have used in the past except the price. It taste bland with a bit of sweetness. Just the way I like my tooth paste.</li>
    <li> this is a great product and it was offered for a great price too. works as advertised. i would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste because it doesn&#x27;t contain the fifty billion other things that a lot of toothpastes do these days that simply add nothing but wearing down your enamel.</li>
    <li> good product at a fair price, shipped promptly and arrived on time</li>
    <li> My dentist told me to only use regular toothpastes with fluoride in them.  Whitening and tarter-control toothpastes (and all the other silly combinations) are very abrasive and can remove the enamel on your teeth, especially near the gum line.  This Crest toothpaste is all a toothpaste should be - it leaves my teeth feeling clean and slick, and the taste is very pleasant.</li>
    <li> I just never remember to buy toothpaste when I&#x27;m shopping. Thats why getting it by the six pack is so perfect. This crest is the vintage paste with a yummy candy like flavor. The price is wonderful and it was shipped super saver (free) right to my door. Guess I won&#x27;t have to remember to buy this for awhile. WE are really happy with this product :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll stick with time tested Cavity Prevention Crest! Others with new additives may be touted but results don&#x27;t lie....regular Crest with fluoride still does what it claims with no \\&quot;after effects\\&quot;. And it&#x27;s ADA certified! One of the oldest toothpastes is still the best.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. It is hard to find in the stores so it easier to let my mouse do the walking. I also have Prime which really is great.</li>
    <li> hard to beat crest...if you use this toothpaste it only makes sense to buy it in bulk on Amazon...it is a better price</li>
    <li> It is blue. It is paste not gel. It is well-priced. I don&#x27;t know how toothpaste gets 5 stars except by being super tasty, this is regular mint so not so exciting. Good value.</li>
    <li> Everything you need for healthy teeth--a basic paste without all the added junk in many others--and fluoride to prevent cavities. Plain vanilla among toothpastes and does the job.</li>
    <li> I buy Crest from habit. I&#x27;ve tried others but Crest works fine. For really whitening teeth, I use a little baking soda. I doubt Crest will prevent cavities, better than flossing. I&#x27;m not a dentist. But I use it.</li>
    <li> With all the toothpaste options available these days, it has been difficult finding this simple product in stores. Thanks Amazon for having it available at a great price.</li>
    <li> Generally I don&#x27;t overthink it with toothpaste but this stuff is so runny, I&#x27;d say that 6 times out of 10 it drips down my arm or onto the sink/floor.  Can&#x27;t wait to be done with this stuff.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s got a great, slightly rough feeling texture that makes your mouth feel great, whereas most toothpastes are very smooth. Great toothpaste, will make your mouth feel good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Crest toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste. And this LOT of 6 is nice to have on-hand so we never run out. My kids use this, too (ages 8 and 9) and don&#x27;t mind it. Not too &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; --- just the right amount of mint.</li>
    <li> Great old fashioned toothpaste.</li>
    <li> BETS VERY GOOD............</li>
    <li> It is too &#x27;watery&#x27; and seems diluted, and gave an overall sweet aftertaste. I would not buy them again.</li>
    <li> Great bargain, wish they would offer a fluoride free paste as well for this price.</li>
    <li> Good toothpaste and a good price.  The tubes are larger than I expected so a good deal.  The store tubes I was buying are smaller making them more expensive.</li>
    <li> Popular and original tooth creme for your &amp;#34;twice a day&amp;#34; brushing.  The packaging of course has changed over the decades.</li>
    <li> i dont like this product at all. crest toothpastes always cost more and this one tastes terrible. dont buy this.</li>
    <li> I am only using crest toothpaste, and will continue to do so. I hate any other brand, they are far too strong!  the price is good here on amazon,</li>
    <li> good product... probably it will last all year long... huge toothpaste!  that&#x27;s why I rated 5 stars. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good stuff and good deal !!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if this was a bad batch but this stuff, that they call \\&quot;Regular,\\&quot; seemed much thinner than the other versions with the Scope stripe.  Returned the 6 tubes and went to the store to try a tube of Crest \\&quot;Complete.\\&quot;  It was fine so I&#x27;ll just steer clear of the Regular in the future.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY toothpaste my husband will use. I really hope they never stop making it. Do you hear me, Crest? Don&#x27;t EVER stop making Crest Regular paste.</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for years and it&#x27;s still my favorite. Like others have said, I prefer the regular paste over the others with all that added crap. I read that some of these so-called &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; pastes can actually be abrasive on your teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been following Dr. Ellie&#x27;s \\&quot;Kiss your dentist goodbye\\&quot; teeth whitening program since Feb 1, 2013 when I first got my package of items in the mail including this toothpaste. Was nice to get a package of 6 however I&#x27;ll be giving at least a couple away to the local food shelf. No need to keep 6 in my bathroom if someone else could use a few!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not familiar with her program I encourage you to check it out. It involves 4 steps the second one being using this toothpaste after making sure your brush is thoroughly disinfected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t too surprising but disappointing none the less to learn that most dental products on the market are not only all hype, but can actually damage your teeth. Why put extra chemicals into your mouth when good old fashioned Crest toothpaste does the job with no problems and no unnecessary ingredients. I&#x27;ve re-oriented my view of dental products and now just go with the tried and true good products (Closys, Crest, Listerine, ACT flouride). I now just ignore any dental marketing/commercials I see. Following these steps in this exact order has really helped my teeth. They are a lot less sensitive, my gums are looking better and brown stains are disappearing. I look forward to solid white and strong teeth done the natural (remineralized) way. :D</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not like the normal white paste.  Personally that&#x27;s what I like-the very fresh, thick consistency in the mouth.  This toothpaste doesn&#x27;t bubble up as thick as the normal white paste.  Colgate&#x27;s normal &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; is like the traditional white paste you&#x27;d expect.  In order to get the same bubbling/thickness in the mouth, you&#x27;d have to use more than double the amount you&#x27;d use for Colgate&#x27;s normal &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34;.  So, you end up using more tooth paste with this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for a million years. It&#x27;s great. You can&#x27;t beat the cheap price and it tastes just fine.</li>
    <li> Great buy. This will last like a year supply. For the cost and amount, you can&#x27;t beat it! This is also the large tubes. The smaller tubes go for $2-$3. Why wouldn&#x27;t you buy this. Save $$$!</li>
    <li> This \\&quot;plain\\&quot; Crest toothpaste (tp) is wonderful. I have used this kind of Crest tp since childhood (better part of 40 yrs) and love it! Some things you can buy the knockoff brand with little difference in quality. This is not one of those.&lt;br /&gt;These days, it&#x27;s hard to find just plain old tp - the kind that just gives you cavity protection, not wakes you up in the morning with a 7 course meal prepared. As one reviewer stated, some of the extras offered in tp actually harm your teeth when used long term. One of my friends had a relative who used heavy baking soda tp. After years of doing that, the polish was stripped off her teeth. Not a good situation. I use Crest Pro Health (the 7 course meal tp) once every two weeks. Moderation is the best policy with the all in one tps.</li>
    <li> I have been using crest toothpaste all of my life, and will continue to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate the gels, they are far too strong!  This paste does the trick.  Pretty good price here on amazon, as well, the 8 pack.</li>
    <li> crest is the best toothpaste around.  i have been using it since i was a little kid.  only the regular tho.</li>
    <li> And my teeth are cleamer</li>
    <li> I have used this toothpaste for 30+ years and it has done a great job.  I have had very few cavities over the years.</li>
    <li> Crest Cavity Protection contains sodium fluoride which does not stain teeth. CCP is a plain &amp;#34;vanilla&amp;#34; type of toothpaste which is not as abrasive as others. Since the brushing is what removes the food particles and plaque buildup, the toothpastes main job is to lay down the fluoride which CCP does nicely. &amp;#34;Dr Ellie&amp;#34; recommends it and so do I.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste. It came in a bunch. It&#x27;s a good deal. I bought it.  Don&#x27;t need to worry about running out for a while.</li>
    <li> Good enough. Good stuff for this price. I would definitely recommend this. And Crest is one of the best brands for sure.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s my favorite toothpaste. great stuff. my favorite flavor. we use it and keep it in stock for guests as well as ourselves.</li>
