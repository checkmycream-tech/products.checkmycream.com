### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>this is cheaper and the best yet</li>
      <li>Great contour set.</li>
      <li>Kinda sticky, but I loved the colored concealers.</li>
      <li>but it is good to use</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used city color and LOVED it, so idk if this is a knock off or just some BS, but if you zoom in on their pics the product looks amazing...</li>
      <li>actually love this product!</li>
      <li>LOVE this product!</li>
      <li>LOVE!</li>
      <li>Honestly buy it guys</li>
      <li>I have my own brushes, but really enjoyed the pore correctors and three shades to use.  </li>
      <li>If you have darker skin than this will probably work better for you.</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>Ok product for the price.</li>
      <li>Love the idea of this palette, but it&#x27;s not the easiest to work with.</li>
      <li>Really easy instruction, love that it&#x27;s not powder.  </li>
      <li>Great product very creamy &amp; applys on smoothly without being cakey</li>
      <li>/&gt;First, I feel like this product can fit so many skin shades and pigments.</li>
      <li>it would I could have went to a store and done it just as easy</li>
      <li>For the price, it works well and is fairly easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It also gives great and simple directions for where to highlight, contour, and bronze.</li>
      <li>The correcting cream is too light basically  </li>
      <li>I guess if you want to practice  your contouring skills and don&#x27;t want to spend alot of money  on a good one and waste  that good contouring kit.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to get this for my redness and under eye area.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to use this product...</li>
      <li>I was really excited to get my hands on this kit.  </li>
      <li>The top colors were pretty fun to play with.</li>
      <li>I am really fair, so I can only use the 2 lighter colors for contouring.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re pretty much like brushes you get in a little girl&#x27;s makeup/glitter kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the brushes, though, this contour kit is awesome.</li>
      <li>But the product starts off creamy but goes on kind of dry.</li>
      <li>The product looks exactly like in the pack.</li>
      <li>But like really?!</li>
      <li>Just make sure your more moisturized than usual when applying this product, it&#x27;s on the drier side.</li>
      <li>Personally I&#x27;m not a fan of this because I feel as if it&#x27;s really cheap!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty fair skinned and brunette, but found that using this product very moderately is the key.</li>
      <li>I bought this kit for when I really want to have fun doing my makeup and go out for a special occasion or a big night out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Too sticky and the color doesn&#x27;t apply to skin very well.</li>
      <li>you first  open and for first time use.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money, on this try another product that will definetly be way better then this.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin tone look so even and natural!</li>
      <li>too oily  and product  is not long lasting, if you have oily skin I don&#x27;t recommend , this will probably  work better for someone  who has dry skin.</li>
      <li>sucks a little lol</li>
      <li>The colors aren&#x27;t even different and are very oily.</li>
      <li>I now know it can&#x27;t go anywhere near my face...</li>
      <li>I have always had problems with dark circles but using the orangish pink pigment before my foundation did magic.</li>

<li> Not worth it to me...</li>
<li> My dark circles were gone like litteraly not visible at all.</li>
<li> The creams are dry after continuesly removing or wearing out the first layers it  turns into this cream base but it seemed  to be very oily, like a vaseline base type of consistent.  </li>
<li> Start small and then build if you need/want to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I was not very impressed with this contour/correcting pallet.  </li>
<li> I was not happy bacause it did not do as they said</li>

    <li> LOVE this product! Makes my skin tone look so even and natural!</li>
    <li> I would give 10 stars if I could!</li>
    <li> Great contour set. Would reccomend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Personally I&#x27;m not a fan of this because I feel as if it&#x27;s really cheap!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Can&#x27;t wait to use this pallet. I&#x27;m considering creating a bday makeup goodie bag.</li>
    <li> This is a horrible product. The pigmentation of the color corrector is horrible. It does nothing of what it claims to do. Don&#x27;t waste your money, on this try another product that will definetly be way better then this. So disappointing because I truly wanted to love it.</li>
    <li> I was not very impressed with this contour/correcting pallet.  The creams seemed  to not be working for me.when you first  open and for first time use. The creams are dry after continuesly removing or wearing out the first layers it  turns into this cream base but it seemed  to be very oily, like a vaseline base type of consistent.  Its kind of difficult  to work with and not very well at blending. The correcting cream is too light basically  th he same issue  too oily  and product  is not long lasting, if you have oily skin I don&#x27;t recommend , this will probably  work better for someone  who has dry skin. I personally  was not very fond of it but it is good to use I guess if you want to practice  your contouring skills and don&#x27;t want to spend alot of money  on a good one and waste  that good contouring kit. My opinion...I think I&#x27;ll stick with my Anastasia kit. 😉</li>
    <li> Kinda sticky, but I loved the colored concealers.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this product before buying, and I suggest the same!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually love this product! I usually tend to wear very little makeup, and when I do, it&#x27;s typically the moisturizer, tiny bit of bronzer, tiny bit of blush, and mascara each day. I bought this kit for when I really want to have fun doing my makeup and go out for a special occasion or a big night out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I feel like this product can fit so many skin shades and pigments. I&#x27;m pretty fair skinned and brunette, but found that using this product very moderately is the key. Start small and then build if you need/want to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest not using the brushes that come in this kit. They&#x27;re pretty much like brushes you get in a little girl&#x27;s makeup/glitter kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the brushes, though, this contour kit is awesome. It&#x27;s creamy but doesn&#x27;t look heavy or make my sensitive skin break out. It also gives great and simple directions for where to highlight, contour, and bronze. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Worst contouring kit I&#x27;ve ever used. The colors aren&#x27;t even different and are very oily. Extremely displeased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an African American woman and the colors does not work well with the tone of my skin.</li>
    <li> Ehh....not crazy about it sucks a little lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used city color and LOVED it, so idk if this is a knock off or just some BS, but if you zoom in on their pics the product looks amazing... Look at mine. I have red hair, brown hair, brown and black spots, 2 finger prints... Which the camera couldn&#x27;t pick up. But like really?! How am I supposed to put this on my face?! There&#x27;s chunks of crap, random hair and fingerprints... Sounds like a staph infection waiting to happen? Did you hear about the girl who is paralyzed from a staph infection from using a friends make up brush... Not worth it to me... I was so excited to use this product... I now know it can&#x27;t go anywhere near my face... Beyond dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Ok product for the price.</li>
    <li> Really easy instruction, love that it&#x27;s not powder.  I have my own brushes, but really enjoyed the pore correctors and three shades to use.  LOVE!</li>
    <li> My dark circles were gone like litteraly not visible at all. I have always had problems with dark circles but using the orangish pink pigment before my foundation did magic. the pigment in itself erased my dark circles and i was shocked. Honestly buy it guys this is cheaper and the best yet</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this for my redness and under eye area. But the product starts off creamy but goes on kind of dry. It creases a lot, even though I put a primer. Love the idea of this palette, but it&#x27;s not the easiest to work with.</li>
    <li> The product looks exactly like in the pack. I cannot wait to use it on my client only use it on myself.</li>
    <li> Worst contour &amp; highlight product ..</li>
