<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> WOW! My husband comments on how soft my skin is and he tells me everyday how good it feels. Now my teenage daughter is using it now, so you may need to buy an extra bottle if you have teenage girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sheila</li>
    <li> smell so good love it</li>
    <li> Again, I love the Dove products and this was part of my buy 2 at regular price and get the third Dove product free. This is a great way to try out products that I have not yet used yet. This was a great product and I would buy again.</li>
    <li> The product itself, I must say is awesome. It&#x27;s rich, creamy and it really makes my skin feel silky smooth. I sometimes use it as a shaving aid too! The smell isn&#x27;t awesome... it kind of reminds me of those cheep soap bars like Irish spring. I don&#x27;t really mind it but I have to say I was expecting a much nicer, pleasant scent than this one.    Now the reason why I&#x27;m taking off two stars is because one day when I was looking at the ingredients on the back of the bottle, I saw that there was stearic acid, and tallow acid. It didn&#x27;t much to learn that those two ingredients are ANIMAL BI-PRODUCTS. They are derived by highly concentrated and saturated ANIMAL FAT. GROSS! I felt so let down when I saw this, because I have always loved all of dove products. I am afraid that this will be the last Dove product I ever buy. What a let down...</li>
    <li> Good value- convenient transaction- used as a stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Dove beauty products! I feel that almost everything I have tried from their line has delivered on their promises. This softening body wash is no exception. I first tried this when I was pregnant and my skin was unusually dry and itchy. After the first use my skin was noticeably softer. I really love this product and I&#x27;m super excited to try the Dove renewing body wash as well. I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> This body wash helped my itchy skin in 3 days, and made it feel great within the first wash. My only gripe is the bottle design. Because of the thickness of the creme and the bottle shape or the plastic, it is VERY difficult to squeeze the end of the bottle. Add to the fact that being wet in the shower doesn&#x27;t help, and you are wasting a good portion of the product. I would really like to buy this product again, but I don&#x27;t like to waste product... or my money!</li>
    <li> I bought this when Wal**** had a special promotion and was pleasantly surprised.  Very thick cream produces a lot of lather and it smells nice.  I didn&#x27;t notice that it made my skin any softer because I always put body lotion on right after a shower.  I found that when there&#x27;s still quite a bit left in the bottle it is hard to get out because its so thick and the angle of bottle doesn&#x27;t let it drain down.  I had to pry the top off and put it on the bath sponge by shaking it.</li>
    <li> I got this just for the hell of it, and was pleasently suprised, i have no cons at all about this, it made my skin sooo soft nd even got rid of the lil bumps i get on my shoulder blades nd upper back, which i wasnt expecting, this stuff is awsome!!!</li>
    <li> Works well, it softens skin. The bottle doesn&#x27;t work well when trying to get all the soap out, had to pound it on a counter to knock the soap out.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and in the winter I try so many products for relief. This works great. I use it with a natural loofah bath sponge. It smells great too. My husband is sensitive to smells and he actually started using it so it is not overpowering at all.  Love it!</li>
    <li> love how it makes my skin feel like new. and its really revitalize..totally recommend it and more with the exfoliating beads which takes away any death skins</li>
    <li> this is one of my favorite i believe me i have used about every soap Dove has made and this one tops all of them especially with the smell.  it smells sexy</li>
    <li> Love dove soap but the smell is strong and not for me.</li>
    <li> The picture in the advertisement showed Dove Visible Care Softening but we received this instead. You need to make sure picture and product being sold matches. My wife decided to keep what we received but I am not a satisfied customer. Now I am uncertain as to whether I trust purchasing any other products thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> after one use in the shower my body feels alot smoother and softer. its doing what i says so far. love this product will buy more</li>
    <li> While the product contents itself were satisfactory and seemingly well-formulated, the packaging leaves too much of a gap between the opening and the seal; making the product difficult to close.  This also means that a fair portion of the liquid soap inside leaks out every time the bottle is set upright.  Unfortunately, the product&#x27;s container is designed to only stand on the cap and cannot be reversed to prevent the leak.  Keep the bottle on its side to avoid this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully the product I received is just a dud.  The soap itself smells nice and does the job ok.  I ended up transferring the contents into another container.</li>
    <li> I bought this in part because I don&#x27;t always have time to moisturize after I get out of the shower, in part because it was inexpensive, and because I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Dove respect projects.  The thing that&#x27;s surprised me is that I&#x27;m actually getting complements on my skin after using it for a month.  At 40 I view my skin a bit more as upkeep than a particularly attractive part of myself, but, as it turns out with the right care it can be an attractive aspect of my middle aged self.  First my husband commented, then my kids (&amp;#34;wow, Mom, your skin is like, super soft!&amp;#34;), and most recently friends...seriously, it&#x27;s strange for people to be moved to complement my skin of all things, but it&#x27;s happening.  Three cheers for Dove!</li>
    <li> this bodywash is wonderful.......the first time i used it i was shocked, cause i had used dove bodywashes before and they were too oily and very hard to wash off, but this bodywas was just right, it makes my skin feel so soft afterwards before i even lotion my skin. i would tell anyone to buy this......</li>
    <li> Love it!  so creamy and the perfect amount of exfoliant.</li>
    <li> I have been using this body wash for a couple of weeks now.  I love the lather and it does have a very gentile exfoliant.  It leaves my skin very soft.  My only complaint, the fragrance is not your typical dove original scent, it smells like a heavily perfumed cheap potpourri.  5 stars if they change the fragrance!</li>
    <li> Thank you Dove for hearing our complaints and doing something about it.  My oncologists said Dove would be gentle to my skin while on chemo, so I bought 4 bottles and after the first one, I realized it was not going to work for me.  I could not get the soap from the bottom because it was thick and because of the funny top, I couldn&#x27;t stand it on end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I am so happy, this is the best because chemo gives me extreme dry skin and I need a gentle exfoliate, it is not as thick and I can stand it on end.  The lid is perfect, the fragrance wonderful and I will never change.</li>
    <li> i dont know why this product was discontinued, but was very thankful it was available on amazon. great scent, and really is good on my skin. i want more!!!</li>
    <li> I love to shower with this body wash.  It makes my skin feels so soft.  I feel clean and fresh! I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess what, I updated my comments on Oct. 9, 2013:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to blend this product with the \\&quot;Olay 2-In-1 Advanced Ribbons Soothing Cr&amp;egrave;me + Advanced Moisture Body Wash 18 Oz (Pack of 3.)\\&quot; The experience was both revitalizing, invigorating and rejuvenating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when \\&quot;I bathe, I find that I do Not leave a dirty, bathtub ring!\\&quot; I&#x27;m sold, ring it up and get it to me quickly. They work fabulously together.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to start by saying that I have never had sensitive skin and I have used most body wash products without any issues. In addition, I would like to say that my results are probably not common and when my husband used this product, his skin improved greatly. However, that was not the case with my experience with this product. I was ecstatic about trying out this product and getting more radiant skin. The instant that my package arrived I went and tried it out. A mere two days after using Dove however, I found that my skin had broken out very dramatically. Bumps covered every inch of my shoulders and soon after, my back closely resembled a pizza. I kept using it for another week or two, convinced that maybe it was just supposed to get worse before it got better. That did not happen. I kept this product for my husband and went and bought myself St. Ives which, after a week, has already shown itself to dramatically improve my skin, and even gave it a bit of a nice glow. Since I am not clear if I am the only case of this, and my husband did get more radiant skin, I&#x27;m giving this three stars just to be fair, but I cannot recommend this.</li>
    <li> I Love this Body wash! smells so nice and I leave the shower feeling like I have a new set of skin! The softening is wonderful!</li>
    <li> A creamy, great-smelling body wash that really makes my skin soft! The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that even though the bottle is half-full, the body wash doesn&#x27;t come out easily from the bottle. Maybe because it is a little thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely try the Dove renewing body wash since I like this one a lot. The scent is light and it is gentle on my dry, sensitive, prone to eczema skin.</li>
    <li> With a combination of eczema and the dry Las Vegas weather, this is the only body wash I can use. I&#x27;ve been using this body wash for about 4 years now, and hope they continue to make it. Love it!</li>
    <li> It did not seem nourishing or exfoliating. This and glue like.</li>
    <li> So, admittedly I do have dry and sensitive skin, and soap has never been my friend, and perhaps I&#x27;m allergic to something in this body wash that I&#x27;m not aware of. However, this body wash dried my body out pretty darn bad(very dry elbows and knees!) and left me with little rashy patches on my chest, legs, and stomach. I didn&#x27;t immediately connect the dry skin and rashes to the soap, seeing as how it&#x27;s a Dove soap, and Dove is supposed to be great for dry and sensitive skin, but it started after the first time I used this body wash and the more I use it the worse it gets. Then I noticed that this soap uses fragrance and artificial dyes(red 30 lake), I&#x27;m not aware if that&#x27;s what caused the bad reaction for me, but I know those are not sensitive skin-friendly ingredients. If you have sensitive skin at all I highly recommend seeking a different body soap.</li>
    <li> i like dove products and this bodywash is very good especially in winter season to make the skin soft and moisturizing.....&lt;br /&gt;good product for good price and a clip coupon is also available for this product....that&#x27;s so nice....</li>
    <li> A good body wash. Leaves skin feeling soft. Does the job. Very comparable to other brands, Got it on subscribe n save.</li>
    <li> I like it. But it falls short of the Renewing cr&amp;egrave;me. The smell has hints of Lavender, and Vanilla. But as soon as you rinse the fragrance has disapated. As far as the softness; it still doesn&#x27;t compare to the Visible care Renewing---</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t need to put cream on my body after bath, which save me precious time</li>
    <li> This I liked, there was one thing I learned. The bottle only rests on one end. One must take care when opening to use, as the contents will be out before your ready.</li>
    <li> Dove Visible Care is very softening without using lotion.  Even though we did not have the average winter this year, my skin still gets dry.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> tried many body wash products from dove and finally love this. try it and you will love it. Its creamy and has rich foam.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and have not expected it to be that good. I start to love DOVE.</li>
    <li> The bodywash feels good on the skin. It smalls good and cleans well. I still like Oil of Olay better.</li>
    <li> Very good body wash,  moisturizing and smells extremely good, it was worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash! Super moisturizing and feels clean. Great fresh smell. My whole family uses it, from little ones to grown ups :)</li>
    <li> I love Dove products and I was looking for this one but couldn&#x27;t find it near my place. and coz I don&#x27;t have to go and look it up somewhere else, I bought it online.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this product on the first use. I love the fragrance. It is invigorating and the scent lasts well after use. It leaves the skin soft, silky, and smooth. I saw changes in my skin within a few days. I will definitely purchase more of this scent.</li>
    <li> I ordered this by mistake. I thought it was Dove VisibleCare Softening body wash. The bottles are almost exactly the same, color scheme and all. That being said, I&#x27;m pleased with the product. It&#x27;s very moisturizing, and the exfoliating beads are very gentle. I have very sensitive skin and this body wash works for me.</li>
    <li> very good proguct for my dray condition.</li>
    <li> I had been using a particular type of Dove body wash but all of a sudden it does not seem to be available any longer.  I took a chance on this exfoliating style and love it!  I use it not only as an all-purpose body wash, but especially find it works great as a shaving &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34;.  I put some on my body pouf, get a good lather and then use it on my legs before shaving.  It works like a charm and my legs seem to go longer between shaves - quite an unexpected bonus.  I highly recommend this product, especially for people who have dry skin and may need the exfoliating beads to keep their skin hydrated and smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year now. It feels almost like a body lotion. It won&#x27;t foam but it smells nice and feels luxurious.</li>
    <li> Very thick. Works well if you have dry skin. Feels nice when you wash. Pleasant flower-y scent. The container itself is made of a strong material; not likely to leak, even standing upside down on the shelf or ledge.</li>
    <li> Dove is my favorite body wash/shampoo/conditioner brand and all the body washes are great.  I love that this one has just the right amount of exfoliation without causing your skin to be too sensitive.</li>
    <li> Texture unique, à la fois mousse, gel et crème. L&#x27;effet sur la peau est délicieux !  Parfum agréable.</li>
    <li> I am a complete and loyal fan of Dove&#x27;s body washes and won&#x27;t buy anything else. This &amp;#34;Creme Mousse gentle exfoliating&amp;#34; wash sounded like a great idea so I ordered one to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t until a week later that I connected the dots between my dry and flaking skin and this new body wash! It feels okay when in the shower, but obviously doesn&#x27;t provide the same level of moisturization as some of their other types. I may also be a bit of an anomaly but I just wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; texture... I didn&#x27;t feel like it was doing much in the way of exfoliation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with Dove&#x27;s Deep Moisture, NutriumMoisture, or Sensitive washes instead. I just ordered their Nourishing wash in shea butter and vanilla and am loving it!</li>
    <li> Only need to use a little with a puff. Nice and moisturizing. Smells good too without being overpowering.</li>
    <li> Love this! I would occasionally get little bumps on the back of my arm. This product clears it up after a few uses.</li>
    <li> The way that this item was packaged was not that great. Like all the other body washes that came, all were shipped in a box and all were on the very bottom of the box with no cushioning on the bottom and just a plastic air cushions on the top. One of them actually came with a broken cap top. Wasn&#x27;t really happy with that.</li>
    <li> Very nice leaves your skin so soft</li>
    <li> I wash with this every day.  Massage therapist comments how soft my skin is.</li>
    <li> Great body wash. I wasn&#x27;t expecting the little beads, but they&#x27;ve helped a lot with the very dry, cold weather. They&#x27;re especially useful when scrubbing calloused feet and the like.</li>
    <li> Love this body wash makes your skin really soft. Good product!</li>
