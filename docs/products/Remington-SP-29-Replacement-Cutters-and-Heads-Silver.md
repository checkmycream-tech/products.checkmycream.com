      <li>Haven&#x27;t taken the replacement blades out of the package, though I&#x27;m sure someday I will.</li>
      <li>The top bulleted description says this &amp;#34;Fits Shaver Models: R-450s, R-650s&amp;#34</li>
      <li>like should just have easily put into my razor.  </li>
      <li>and these blades were easy to put in.</li>
      <li>It  has been a magnificent razor for everyday use.</li>
      <li>Exactly what was advertised!!</li>
      <li>I over extended my original blades/heads with the ones that came from the original product.</li>
      <li>Rinse and keep them clean</li>
      <li>Fantastic to be able to find replacement blades for my husband&#x27;s old razor!</li>
      <li>Fits the shaver and was delivered quickly</li>
      <li>I ordered it as I needed it, it arrived quite quickly</li>
      <li>On the downside directions are kind of quirky but managed to get them installed.</li>
      <li>Once I replaced these new heads my neck does not get skin irritation anymore!!!</li>
      <li>We were having trouble finding these replacement blades at the store we purchased the shaver at and were so glad to find they were still available.</li>
      <li>found the exact replacement blades on Amazon, very inexpensive and they shipped them very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>very easy to replace my old heads and noplace on the internet or walmart and other stores were this inexpensive</li>
      <li>am 62 years old, and I have never used another razor (electric or straight blade) that even comes close to the comfort and smoothness of a Titanium blade.</li>
      <li>My razor works like new.  </li>
      <li>The housing around the blades have to be removed from the new blades and the new blades will have to be put in the housing from your razor leaving brand new parts to be thrown away.</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ll have to buy a new shaver anyway.</li>
      <li>After spraying the lubricant on the old blades, just to try them, it felt like a brand new shaver.</li>
      <li>Now it is like I have a new razor for much less than replacing the whole unit.</li>
      <li>Though these blades do work they are not a simple swap with the old blades.  </li>
      <li>If they last half as well as the originals, well worth the money.</li>

<li> Don&#x27;t last as long as I would like.</li>
<li> It probably wasn&#x27;t so much a problem of dull blades as it was a problem with the motor/battery in my shaver.</li>
<li> Will not fit a regular R-450 model shaver.</li>
<li> Be careful buying this product.</li>
<li> I use them once or twice a day and a set usually lasts me about 5 or 6 months before I replace them (this is with proper cleaning).</li>

<li> This product is getting hard to find locally!</li>

<li> The cutter heads would not fit into the Remington R450 shaver even though the product packaging says it will.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> my Razor is cutting like new again</li>
<li> It was not appropriate for my model Remmington razer  </li>
<li> Hard to find these in stores.</li>
<li> Drove me insane trying to find them.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. Good deal.</li>
    <li> Very good product with excellent price from supplier.  This product is getting hard to find locally!</li>
    <li> Works great and a good price.</li>
    <li> The product did not fit in my Remington SP-29, despite them being made for it.  Perhaps I just got a dud?</li>
    <li> When my shaver started grabbing my hair and pulling (painfully), I thought I would try buying new blades instead of a new shaver. It doesn&#x27;t grab as often, but it still grabs. It probably wasn&#x27;t so much a problem of dull blades as it was a problem with the motor/battery in my shaver. I think I&#x27;ll have to buy a new shaver anyway.</li>
    <li> We were having trouble finding these replacement blades at the store we purchased the shaver at and were so glad to find they were still available. Thank you for having them.</li>
    <li> My razor works like new.  This after trying to find replacements for it.  Which proved more than difficult.  Drove me insane trying to find them.</li>
    <li> Though these blades do work they are not a simple swap with the old blades.  I had to disassemble what looked like should just have easily put into my razor.  Note that if you have an R650, it will take a bit of work to get these to work in your razor. The housing around the blades have to be removed from the new blades and the new blades will have to be put in the housing from your razor leaving brand new parts to be thrown away.</li>
    <li> Fits the shaver and was delivered quickly</li>
    <li> It was not appropriate for my model Remmington razer  I returned it and ordered the correct item (SP-25)  SP-25 worked great  Amazon credited me with the cost of the improper SP-29 upon receipt back from me  All went well!</li>
    <li> I over extended my original blades/heads with the ones that came from the original product. Once I replaced these new heads my neck does not get skin irritation anymore!!! Nice and smooth shave! On the downside directions are kind of quirky but managed to get them installed.</li>
    <li> Be careful buying this product. The top bulleted description says this &amp;#34;Fits Shaver Models: R-450s, R-650s&amp;#34; while the &amp;#34;Product Description&amp;#34; says Fits Remington R-450 &amp; R-650 shavers. It is for the &amp;#34;s&amp;#34; models. Will not fit a regular R-450 model shaver. Returned with no hassle.</li>
    <li> The cutter heads would not fit into the Remington R450 shaver even though the product packaging says it will.&lt;br /&gt;I had to return for a refund.</li>
    <li> I bought these to replace the originals on my shaver, and some of the Remington spray lubricant as well. After spraying the lubricant on the old blades, just to try them, it felt like a brand new shaver. Haven&#x27;t taken the replacement blades out of the package, though I&#x27;m sure someday I will. If they last half as well as the originals, well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This was my second set of replacement blades. Rinse and keep them clean you can get 18 months or more use.</li>
    <li> very easy to replace my old heads and noplace on the internet or walmart and other stores were this inexpensive so i got 3 pkgs</li>
    <li> These are of great quality. I use them once or twice a day and a set usually lasts me about 5 or 6 months before I replace them (this is with proper cleaning).</li>
    <li> I ordered it as I needed it, it arrived quite quickly so I am very happy with this order and recommened it, for others who need and want it!</li>
    <li> I received my Remington Titanium Razor as a gift about 5+ years ago. It  has been a magnificent razor for everyday use. The blades started pulling a little about a month ago, so I decided to order new.&lt;br /&gt;I found the exact replacement blades on Amazon, very inexpensive and they shipped them very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Now my Razor is cutting like new again and I hope it lasts another 5+ years.&lt;br /&gt;I am 62 years old, and I have never used another razor (electric or straight blade) that even comes close to the comfort and smoothness of a Titanium blade. On a scale  of 1-10 , I would give it a 25.</li>
    <li> Fantastic to be able to find replacement blades for my husband&#x27;s old razor! Hard to find these in stores.</li>
    <li> Exactly what was advertised!!</li>
    <li> Very good shave. Don&#x27;t last as long as I would like.</li>
    <li> Livraison très rapide.&lt;br /&gt;Merci!</li>
    <li> These replacement blades work perfectly in my razor. I have the R-460d and these blades were easy to put in. Now it is like I have a new razor for much less than replacing the whole unit.</li>
