<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love it.. my skin is so clear</li>
    <li> This soap is awesome i love it!!!😁😁😁😃😀😀😃😍😙😘😚</li>
    <li> Soap that I can not live without!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Much less expensive than buying at my local health food store.  Also, these are not as drying as some other types of Black Soap.</li>
    <li> This soap is a great soap that is made up of all natural products unlike regular soap bought at stores which that for me has made my skin more smooth and acne free. I tend to have a lot of black heads and it helped clear them and using African Shea butter makes the skin a lot better than regular soap and lotion or Vaseline.</li>
    <li> I began using this soap on my face because I have very oily skin and I get breakouts in the summer months.  Wonderful results! My skin did not break out and was much smoother. I then ordered a 6-pack and began showering with it the following winter.  My skin is very sensitive so I can&#x27;t use anything with perfumes in it.  I noticed that my skin did not get as dry as it usually does in the winter, and remained soft and supple. Now it&#x27;s the only face and body soap I use.  I recommend it to friends and family all of the time.</li>
    <li> I have just been using it for a week so I haven&#x27;t seen the effects yet, but I just love how its natural and clean well. And Very inexpensive!</li>
    <li> Ok, so it dosen&#x27;t smell so great, anyway it smalls like the ingredients listed \\&quot;earthy\\&quot; not exactly the scent I go for. However, the smell does not linger. I think that this bar is great for anyone looking for something natural. I have trided Dr. Bronners and I hated it, this bar works for hair and body as well.</li>
    <li> You are the best always</li>
    <li> I like the scent of the soap, the odor reducer and it helps to smooth bumps from face. It&#x27;s enjoyable and beneficial product</li>
    <li> This has become my only facial cleanser.  It is creamy, smells wonderful, cleans all traces of makeup and leaves my face soft.  The anti-inflammatory ingredients prevent the redness that using soap on my face usually produces. I like this so much I have given several bars as gifts with very positive feedback.  Time to order more!</li>
    <li> great product! smell soooooo good !</li>
    <li> This soap targeted my long time problem areas, reddened them, and then left beautiful skin that people tell me is glowing.  From the first I knew it was different.  Love it and will never be without it.  Worked on my entire body.</li>
    <li> Will not recommend this! Dried up my skin and smelled like a cheap washing powder.&lt;br /&gt;Did not see any visible benefits on skin.</li>
    <li> My skin has improved with every use...</li>
    <li> Everything is okay&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> This dudu-osun is a very good bar of soap and I usually pay $4 a bar plus my entire family uses it so I normally get it in packs of 24. My teenage son loves it because it keeps his skin clear and even toned. He had very dark acne scars but they have faded so much that you can hardly tell they were ever there not to mentioned his face is probably a shade if not two lighter than before. I have a 10yr old son (who is Albino) and a 9yr old daughter (who has extra dry skin). They both use it with no issue and my hubby who works in a chemical plant loves how clean he feels out of the shower. When anyone is bathing, you will know it, the entire house smells like a very tropical place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I considered giving it three stars because I can&#x27;t use this soap, it gives me a burning sensation all over my body and my face is irritated for days afterwards. But since my cheeks, nose &amp; chin have become so smooth in the little time I did, I&#x27;d like to give it a 4.5. My pores have practically vanished and I have some acne scarring that&#x27;s improved significantly. I do use the dudu-oson from time to time on my face knowing that even though I am going to pay for it, my skin will be glowing.</li>
    <li> I  my DUDU soap it my makes my feel wonderful after a bath</li>
    <li> Seriously I have no clue how this soap works but it really does. My skin has always been soft, but this soap has completely change the look of my skin. It softens it but more then that it makes it glow. I assume it is exfoliating my skin and that&#x27;s why it glows but it really does glow. It is a little harsh if I leave it on my skin too long, I feel it burn. And I don&#x27;t know how to say this so I will just say it: it kinda burns the lower region so it has to be used in that area quickly! My husband always has something weird going on with his skin but since using this his skin looks so much smoother and clearer. I have a bad scar and this with papaya soap has faded all redness from the scar. I really think this is amazing soap...BUT be prepared for a gross shower liner when using this... I freaked out when I noticed it the first time cause I though it was mold or something but the soap clings to shower curtains and turns them brown. Also the soap doesn&#x27;t smell all that great but it doesn&#x27;t leave any scent so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  One bar lasts forever too.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin with breakouts.  This soap seemed to start to help immediately.  I really like it because it seems to keep my skin from getting oily for a longer time than other soaps that I have tried.  I will continue to use this soap for a while.</li>
    <li> Soap is very good, my daughter used soap on her scalp psorisis and it cleared it up.  Soap can be a little drying especially in the winter months. Overall a very good soap.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this soap.The first couple of days the soap slightly burned around the nose area but after a week it was fine. It cleared up my daughter&#x27;s acne and faded most of the dark spots I had on my face.Now it does make your skin pretty dry but I apply shea butter immediately after rinsing. My whole family uses it now. This soap is the best black soap I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> Going through chemo, I purchased this soap to take care of general cleansing needs. Combined with the use of raw shea butter, it took care of the  skin problems I had during treatment.  For me the only problem I had with this product is I found it un-useful for the private areas, it caused a bit of rash b/c of the ash content.</li>
    <li> Great soap, great scent. People, this soap is for everyone, not just black people (do you know how incredibly ignorant that sounds?! I wish people would research stuff before they perpetuate this kind of nonsense.) It is called \\&quot;black\\&quot; soap because there are plant ashes in the soap, giving it it&#x27;s dark appearance. It is made from leaves and bark of various trees and plants that are burned in a kettle or vat. The leaves are from banana trees, plantain skins, leaves and bark, palm tree leaves, cocoa pods, shea tree bark, etc. The ashes from the leaves are then mixed with water and then filtered. Oils such as shea butter, coconut oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, and cocoa butter are added to this water to create the soap.</li>
    <li> It works great so far!</li>
    <li> Still the only soap I use after 7+ years.  Every black soap uses a different recipe and this one works best for me. Keeps my skin soft and clean.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this soap for years I love the way it feels on my skin and it has a wonderful smell great product.</li>
    <li> Smells great and is very relaxing. Works great for my daughter who struggles with eczema. This is the only soap we use now.</li>
    <li> I have VERY sensitive skin and eczema so I ordered this soap to give it a try. The shipping was fast! It came three days after I ordered it. The smell was VERY powerful! I opened the Amazon box and my living room was lit up with this soaps smell. I was scared it was going to burn my skin because it smelt strong, so I dint use it until 4 days later. BEST SOAP EVER!!! It last long because it is very thick, good fragrance, AND it dint burn at all. I use to use Dove Sensitive Soap, but not no more. This African soap is WAAAAAAAAAAAY better than Dove.</li>
    <li> Our entire family loves this soap and it is worth the price and lasts a long time.  We have bought this many times.</li>
    <li> My favorite soap. I am a regular buyer now. I have recommended it to family and friends and they love it as well.</li>
    <li> A couple of years ago I was searching for a soap that would not be so harsh on my skin, especially during the winter months. I had heard about black soap from Africa and started to look around for some. I found Dudu-Osun and have never gone back to conventional soaps with all the chemicals in them. Dudu-Osun is all natural and has a wonderful fresh scent. Each package is stamped with a production date for freshness. I can recommend this soap to anyone…even babies. Give it a try and you will never go back.</li>
    <li> I have wanted to try this for quite some time. My son was left quadriplegic after a motorcycle accident and I am his caregiver. He has always had sensitive skin and occasionally acne. This soap cleared his skin after one use and left it feeling soft. I am using it for myself too and I absolutely loved it for me as well. It has a nice scent and amazing lather. I am glad that I found it here.</li>
    <li> This product was great and far cheaper than what other locations are offering for one bar of this soap. I will definitely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> the aforementioned title is selfexplanatory. This soap is absolutely phenomenal!&lt;br /&gt;I Have read many reviews before I purchase and I definitely concur that this indeed the holy grail.&lt;br /&gt;The Seller also did an an excellent job pakaging, ensuring we received the authentic soap and mostly for sourcing and providing us withproducts to really makes us beautiful, healthy. Moreover the seller Aurora  Naturaldemonstrated stewardship for the ecological system, the earth and respect for the Most High by only providing nontoxix products that do not impact negatively on the earth.&lt;br /&gt; Sincerely&lt;br /&gt;Camille</li>
    <li> This is a soap to go to for a deep clean however it will leave your skin dry so make sure to use lotion. If you&#x27;re looking for an exfoliating bar the you have arrived to the right location</li>
    <li> This soap is a daily necessity for me!</li>
    <li> This soap smells so refreshing. I&#x27;ve read reviews about it drying out your skin and at times it does attend to dry out your skin a little but nothing a little olive oil won&#x27;t take care of! I love the smell, it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and leaves my skin feeling clean. I use it for my facial cleanser and it does an amazing job!</li>
    <li> This is the best soap, this side of heaven! Every time I purchase something else, Dudu Osun calls me back. A great deal! Great for acne, dry skin, and any type of ailment. My godparents are Caucasian and when they used it, they were shocked! It works for everyone!!!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this soap!!!! It rid my daughter of the excema she had on the back of her leg.</li>
    <li> Nice. Does not dry the skin. Makes the skin moist and toned. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love it my daughter&#x27;s face is clearing up, dont spend  $$$$ on other products this works for her.  I love it too.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Been using it over 10 years!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0023A7JF4 Dudu-osun African Black Soap (100% Pure) Pack of 4]] I am so glad to have found this soap again, it was like finding water out in the Sahara Desert!  I used to purchase this product about 4-5 years ago from my beautician, but she retired.  Since then I have resorted to purchasing black soaps, most of much poorer quality from Beauty Supply store, Walmart, Walgreens and etc..  None ever equalled the astounding results that my husband and myself get in the quality, cleanness, beauty of our skin from this product.  Dudu Osun African Black Soap is a Godsend, it does not dry our skin out, it has a pleasant scent, and the bar last a long time.  We use it for our face, hair and body.  Truly thankful to have found this product again!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this soap.  It laters really well, and makes my skin super soft.  Because it is all natural, I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> very good very fast thank you</li>
    <li> Honestly, I am neutral on this product. I don&#x27;t know if it worked for me or not. But I do know when I first started to use this product all the impurities came up form my skin (facial), and took a while to go away. I am not too sure because during this time I would use normal soap for washing my face or clean and clear cleanser and face scrub, so I am not sure which one worked. Plus I would still get occasional breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it ladders well and it melts fast, even if I drain my soap dish and the Black soap is still wet it melt badly on the soap dish. Hence, causing the soap to finish quicker.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite soap to use on my whole body. It smells great, feels great when washing with it, and is made from all natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading the great reviews! I am absolutely ecstatic about this soap. I purchased it with the 100% pure raw african shea butter. I wash my face and body with the soap then slather on some shea butter. My skin was noticeably brighter, smoother, and clearer after the first use! I battle with sensitive, acne prone skin and have tried so many products in the past but the dudu osun and shea butter seem to be the right combination for my skin. Definitely recommend the dudu-osun soap and suggest pairing it with the shea butter!&lt;br /&gt;fyi- shea butter is non-comedogenic so it won&#x27;t clog pores or make you break out! Some reviewers complained about stinging after use of the soap but I did not have any irritation! :)</li>
    <li> It is a good product and I am happy wit it and I will purchase it again when we need it.</li>
    <li> Great soap and fast shipping will purchase again.</li>
    <li> excellent product and will order again within the next thirty days.</li>
    <li> AN AMAZING SOAP WITH AN AMAZING CLEAN THAT LEADS TO AMAZING RESULTS.</li>
    <li> Very good soap, better then any other soap I have used.</li>
    <li> Product  would be a great product except for the fact that it leaves a black residue when you use it.</li>
    <li> Love this soap. It really remove the dirt on your skin while softening your skin. I have recommend this soap to family and friends, they all love this soap. Two thumbs up!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  The lather is great and smells good.  BUT!  if you use a washcloth the soap will acutally make it dark but don&#x27;t let that discourage you. It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
    <li> Very nice i iwll buy it again.</li>
    <li> Cannot say enough about this soap. I have eczema and within two days it cleared the patch. I also have spirally, curly hair and with just the soap I can get through my hair. I am not using conditioner anymore. My family came to stay and I told them to use it. My sister-in-law&#x27;s dry patch on her elbow was gone with one use. They left saying they were going to get this soap. Oh, and I have a burn on my arm that was extremely dark. Within one month, it has lightened at least five shades. l LOVE this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:half an hour later then when I wrote this I go to get the mail and they sent me twelve more boxes and the note read: \\&quot;Thank you for your hospitality and for letting me in on this great find.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have used this soap on my face for the last 5 years.  I cleanses the skin and make it feel soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> Amazing! Finally have a clear complexion. AMAZING!! You have nothing to lose, it&#x27;s so inexpensive. I highly recommend it for all skin types.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found this. I&#x27;ve been on a quest for all natural products and this one is one of my favorites. I started using this about 2 and a half months ago and I&#x27;m never going back. My skin is clearing up, not all that quickly but I don&#x27;t mind; most of my blemishes have faded or are fading and I rarely get break outs and if I do they disappear quickly. After 2 weeks of using it my skin was noticeably softer; my boyfriend came to visit and commented on how abnormally soft my skin was (I kinda didn&#x27;t want to tell him about the soap)! I use it every night in the shower (no rag) and in the morning on my face (every other morning may work as well). A little goes a long way, you don&#x27;t need to slather it on. It is extremely drying but I use 100% Shea Butter, I did have to use regular lotion at some point and it worked fine, I did have to apply a bit more than usual though. Bottom line: this stuff is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*: It turns out this this is all natural save for the fragrance added. The smell has never bothered me, I like it. However if that bothers you maybe it&#x27;s not for you. Overall it&#x27;s still wonderful.</li>
    <li> What else can I say, then perfect?&lt;br /&gt;After I tried Dudu soap, I&#x27;ve found the best price and ordered more..... and more...</li>
    <li> Second time I buy theses great soaps</li>
    <li> Awsome works good on my skin</li>
    <li> When I was a child my parents used to sell this soap, so believe me I know what wonders it can do. I recommend this soap for any skin type. But beware! If you have sensitive skin (like me)  you cannot leave it on your skin for long, it will start to sting because it has LIME JUICE in it. ( So in other words wash one part of your body and rinse, then move on to the next ). But other that that it clears scars and makes your skin beautiful.</li>
    <li> i am a kind of oil skin , i like to use this soap good for  me</li>
    <li> I have dry skin. Nothing hydrates and cleanses like this soap. Use on hair and body. The smell is awesome. Will never buy another brand.</li>

    <li> I purchased this soap a few days ago after seeing it modeled by one Adria D., so i decided to try it, and it was the best soap i ever used....It gave me a deep cleansed feeling as well a tingling sensation that got deep into my skin. Considering it was Black Soap, it did not leave any resudes nor stains on my clothes. After 20 minutes of enjoyment I finally rinsed off and put on a white tee shirt, and there was no stains, so that was a great thing.  I feel the product was modeled VERY WELL by Adria, and I will recommend this to EVERY and ANYONE! I&#x27;m going to place more orders SOON, and I am looking forward to more product from this company....</li>
    <li> We love this soap makes you clean, helps brighten my skin and not dry it out. It also helps remove small bumps on the back of my arms. I have since purchased this but a much larger quantity.</li>
    <li> I use this with my Clarisonic face brush and it leaves my skin feeling fresh, clean and not dry at all. I have normal skin type and have had no problems with this soap drying out my skin. I use it mainly on my face, neck, chest and arms.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I smells awesome and lasts a long time.  It makes you skin feel and look amazing!</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase. I like it so much that I documented the results on youtube. My skin has cleared up and I finally feel comfortable without makeup.</li>
    <li> Church member reccomended this to me to help with razor bumps and it works great. I first pull all hairs in and around the bump then wash with the soap and air dry. it really smells good too.</li>
    <li> A little harsh on sensitive skin (facial), but I do prefer the natural ingredients. work great as a bath soap, nice fresh scent</li>
    <li> I love this soap! Its smells great like I&#x27;m in a forest or jungle lol. My skin felt so soft like butter! I have acne problems and also some on my body and I already see a difference in my skin. Their already getting smaller and lighter. So if you suffer from acne this will be great for you! I also got it delivered pretty fast too! I will buy again This is my new soap! This seller has a customer For life!!! Lol :)</li>
    <li> This soap works great for people who are trying to even their skin tone and get rid of dark marks. The only down side is you have to buy a moisturizer because it really dries out your skin. Other than that this soap is great. The package also came on time and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
    <li> Pure awesome. Cuts through my dirty skin and leaves me feeling soft.</li>
    <li> Very good soap. Ignore the black color. This soap works wonders. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> I RECEIVED MY PRODUCT  AND I AM ENJOYING IT. I GOT A GREAT PRODUCT AT A VERY REASONABLE PRICE. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE. I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE QUALITY OF IT AS WELL. TRY IT YOU WILL ENJOY IT.</li>
    <li> Yes. It is wonderful Dudu-Osun African Black Soap (6 pack).  I continue using it, it is all nature, no itch at all.</li>
    <li> This and another brand are the only soaps I use. I found the pricing to be a steal factoring in what I&#x27;ve been paying for a 6-pack for the last 6 months or longer.</li>
    <li> The soap was great as soaps go. I just love the Clean smell it gives off.</li>
    <li> Whatever it says on the descrition it does it. We love this soap. Don&#x27;t be scared of the volor when you are washing, it is all good</li>
    <li> Great soap and delivered in exceptionally fast time!</li>
    <li> Leaves you squeaky clean</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for close to a year now and it is wonderful.  I have a friend who does not have a computer and he trades me a dinner out for a couple of bars of soap as he thinks it is great soap also.  A bar lasts about a month to six weeks with daily to every other day bathing, and my skin is moist and soft.  I highly recommend you try it.</li>
    <li> Awesome soap! Smoothes your face and makes you look years younger ! It is the only soap I will use on my face and neck.</li>
