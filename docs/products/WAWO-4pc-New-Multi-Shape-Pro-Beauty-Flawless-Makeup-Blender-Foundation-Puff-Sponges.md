      <li>As many have noted, these take forever and a day to get shipped, so make sure you have something on backup until they get here.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s for sure.</li>

      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Amazing dupes worthy of the wait.</li>
      <li>Good quality, fast shipping, was exactly as described and was packaged nicely.</li>
      <li>I purchased  a bunch of makeup and had all the rest very quickly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The paint washed out easily too.</li>
      <li>After it was all said and done, I would say it was a good purchase as a dupe for a high end brand of sponge.</li>
      <li>and fun and easy to use!</li>
      <li>The items are fine for the price...</li>
      <li>these are a cheap knock off.  </li>
      <li>and they do not go on smoothly.  </li>
      <li>Makeup goes on smoothly....</li>
      <li>simply let off your pressing as you swipe, making great bases and accenting for flowers and butterflies.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t bother buying the original &#x27;Smoothie&#x27; for facepainting, as it is super expensive.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So far, I have used the purple one, and it works amazingly well.</li>
      <li>thanks lot :)</li>
      <li>Good enough for the job.</li>
      <li>Very high quality  !!</li>
      <li>They work well and not expensive!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t soak up as much water as others did for a creamery smooth application, but worth it for the price.</li>
      <li>its worth a price</li>
      <li>worth buying ..</li>
      <li>I love what it does to my face natural look</li>
      <li>GREAT LITTLE MAKEUP SPONGES!</li>
      <li>But they actually work good( if they are dry the suck up all your makeup, but if u wet it, it works very nice)</li>
      <li>I am pleased with the overall product.</li>
      <li>Very inexpensive compared to what you find in stores!</li>
      <li>She actually has ordered more for herself.</li>
      <li>The first day that I used these sponges I started getting pimples.</li>
      <li>But I totally recommend them :)</li>
      <li>After comparing beauty blenders, they are just the right size and really help with my make up.</li>
      <li>Firmness doesn&#x27;t seem to be an issue for me, but I haven&#x27;t used a beauty blender or any other kind of foundation sponges before this, either.</li>
      <li>I really like thses;</li>
      <li>It does it&#x27;s job,  just with it would expand more when wet</li>
      <li>For the price you really can&#x27;t beat this.</li>
      <li>They took a whole month too get here.</li>
      <li>Shipping took awhile, but given the price, that didn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
      <li>I received the four shapes in the main picture.</li>
      <li>I love these, they do seem pretty hard but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
      <li>Before these I was using regular makeup wedges which took forever, so these are better in that they don&#x27;t take as long</li>
      <li>Mske sure to wet them enough</li>
      <li>Works EXACTLY the same as a $25 beauty blender from Sephora or anything else.</li>
      <li>I love them, the only thing I don&#x27;t really like about them is that it is not as firm, but does the job.</li>
      <li>I thought they would be more softer, these are jus too hard to work with.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used 2/4 so far</li>
      <li>These blenders are ok - not soft enough even after using them for several weeks they still are too firm.</li>
      <li>DON&#x27;T HOW MUCH YOU WET THEM</li>
      <li>There ok a little firm but works</li>
      <li>I bought a Real Techniques sponge from Ulta for $5.99, and it&#x27;s BETTER than the expensive Beauty Blender!</li>
      <li>My first review was a little off because the puffs looked bigger than they are.</li>

<li> But it didn&#x27;t stop me from using my pink and blue one!</li>
<li> Lasts a very long time..ordered three and got 4 instead. .I</li>
<li> so be advise they were shipped loose in the envelope we received them in.</li>
<li> They did take a lil while to come in, but that was expected.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> There ok a little firm but works</li>
    <li> I can say i love it but it do smell but i don&#x27;t complain about it but its worth a price i don&#x27;t see why some people complain about it..</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re Ok. They don&#x27;t swell when they&#x27;re wet and they don&#x27;t hold the dampness.</li>
    <li> Waited weeks for them and are not the ones which expand in water. They are coarse dry and crumble apart</li>
    <li> Makeup goes on smoothly....Does not get all over fingers.</li>
    <li> Very tough sponge if that makes sense.  Absorbs almost all my makeup.  Have to say I haven&#x27;t tried the beauty blender so I can&#x27;t compare - but wish I didn&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> They do not ansorb any water like a beauty blender should but they still work nicely. I also hate cleaning them it&#x27;s difficult to get out the makeup stains.</li>
    <li> Omg!! I love all of them all tho I have not used them all, I&#x27;m just getting into the makeup an I love the blender !! What for the price you gets all 4 that&#x27;s a steel</li>
    <li> Small and rough. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> My first review was a little off because the puffs looked bigger than they are. The company was even concerned, so they wrote me. I appreciate how conscientious they were, and that shows me great customer service. After comparing beauty blenders, they are just the right size and really help with my make up. I will buy from them again.</li>
    <li> I like these sponges.  It took a while to arrive but they did come by the promised date.  They do have a bit of a weird smell at first just wash them when you get them and take them out of the bag they come in.  They are a bit firm but I do like that I put my foundation on with a brush and the blend it all in with one of these.  They work really nice.</li>
    <li> These are way too hard!  I&#x27;m sorry I wasted my money.  I bought a Real Techniques sponge from Ulta for $5.99, and it&#x27;s BETTER than the expensive Beauty Blender!</li>
    <li> Im very unhappy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) When I received them from the package, the sticky stuff to seal the packaged envelope got stuck to my makeup puff and pulled a piece off :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) They all have a different feel to them. Two are SUPER hard, which i wouldn&#x27;t use on my face let alone my makeup clients face! And the other Two are semi-hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) They smell and don&#x27;t expand when they get wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I was spoiled when I purchased a Beauty Blender!!! I will just have to stick with those.</li>
    <li> These blenders are ok - not soft enough even after using them for several weeks they still are too firm.</li>
    <li> I do face painting for festivals and whatnot; let me just say, getting these was initially a risk as it had mixed reviews for makeup foundation. BUT MY GOD, this is a holy grail for face paint!!! It applies smoothy, evenly and gets every facial nook and cranny. Perfect for around the eyes.  The color would hold in the sponges and wasn&#x27;t watery, giving me the all the paint as I pressed and smoothed. You can even use these for tapering effects! simply let off your pressing as you swipe, making great bases and accenting for flowers and butterflies.&lt;br /&gt;The paint washed out easily too. (a little bit of soap is recommended for black and red)&lt;br /&gt;I use mehron&#x27;s paradise pallet paint, fantasy fx liquid paint and various rainbow cakes. All working well with these sponges.&lt;br /&gt;This seller has em for the cheapest too, I looked around. I didn&#x27;t bother buying the original &#x27;Smoothie&#x27; for facepainting, as it is super expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m definitely keeping this in my arsenal forever.</li>
    <li> I was fully thrilled when my items arrived. Upon using of course I washed them but to my dismay stains appeared when they had dried out. But it didn&#x27;t stop me from using my pink and blue one! I love em!</li>
    <li> Great quality would recommend to anyone that&#x27;s looking for a good price on sponges for makeup. They feel great on face</li>
    <li> Really cheap and good. I love them</li>
    <li> As many have noted, these take forever and a day to get shipped, so make sure you have something on backup until they get here. I received the four shapes in the main picture. So far, I have used the purple one, and it works amazingly well. Firmness doesn&#x27;t seem to be an issue for me, but I haven&#x27;t used a beauty blender or any other kind of foundation sponges before this, either. For the price you really can&#x27;t beat this.</li>
    <li> Works EXACTLY the same as a $25 beauty blender from Sephora or anything else. Definite great buy!</li>
    <li> Good price and good quality. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. I can definately recommend this to anyone that&#x27;s looking for a cheap but good quality makeup blender.</li>
    <li> Amazing dupes worthy of the wait. Mske sure to wet them enough makes my makeup look extremely even i love this item</li>
    <li> It does it&#x27;s job,  just with it would expand more when wet it&#x27;s a bit dense.</li>
    <li> I thought they would be more softer, these are jus too hard to work with. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> an amazing price for an amazing product! they all work perfectly to my standards, and a bit firmer then store bought ones, so dont ruin as easily</li>
    <li> I love what it does to my face natural look Great.and u can use it with any type of makeup.</li>
    <li> these are a cheap knock off.  the sponges are so dense they do not hold the water and expand like the other beauty blenders.  you end up using more make up and they do not go on smoothly.  do not buy...cheap and bad knock off!!!!!!</li>
    <li> very firm, have not really used yet due to overly firm texture, will update review when i actually use them. Shipping took awhile, but given the price, that didn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
    <li> worth buying ..price in nothing compare to product..thanks lot :)</li>
    <li> I received 4 of these in various colors and they are absolutely great! Of course I haven&#x27;t used all 4 of them yet, but these are definitely great for the price. They did take a lil while to come in, but that was expected. GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> They are too stiff and not very porous. Not what i was expecting. I bought a really good one at wegmans for about $3 and change. I will look for one like it... The other thing is it took forever to get delivered!  I purchased  a bunch of makeup and had all the rest very quickly.</li>
    <li> the sponges smelled a little like rubber, so I washed them. After I washed them, the blue one ended up with this weird yellowish/orange stain on it. After it was all said and done, I would say it was a good purchase as a dupe for a high end brand of sponge. You get what you pay for! And I like what I paid for!</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the overall product. One thing I could change is the tear drop shaped sponge, it&#x27;s just a little too hard.</li>
    <li> They work well and not expensive! I think they get the job done. Would recommend, and likely to re-purchase when needed.</li>
    <li> GREAT LITTLE MAKEUP SPONGES!</li>
    <li> Nope crap.  Not even good for kids to play with. Even if it&#x27;s damp it still pick up your product.</li>
    <li> NO GOOD THEY ARE HARD AS A BRICK DO NOT ORDER.I DON&#x27;T HOW MUCH YOU WET THEM THEY SUCK</li>
    <li> Good enough for the job. It doesn&#x27;t soak up as much water as others did for a creamery smooth application, but worth it for the price.</li>
    <li> Save your money. Order pottery sponges instead for Homestuck CosPlay.</li>
    <li> Not like a beauty blender. Too rough for putting on foundation.</li>
    <li> Not too shabby of a product. I&#x27;ve only used 2/4 so far but it works well. When I&#x27;m in a rush I prefer using a brush because blending with a sponge takes time.</li>
    <li> I got these for a cousin of mine for her birthday and she loved them. She actually has ordered more for herself. Makes a great gift for a sister or mother cousin.</li>
    <li> Great sponges! Very inexpensive compared to what you find in stores!</li>
    <li> Very high quality  !! I love it&lt;br /&gt;Good material&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended for liquid makeup base!! Good low price for excellent quality</li>
    <li> The first day that I used these sponges I started getting pimples. I will definitely not used them anymore that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> I purchased these products about a little bit over a week. I love them, the only thing I don&#x27;t really like about them is that it is not as firm, but does the job. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I really like thses; great price, great product. I just need to find something to store these in. But I totally recommend them :)</li>
    <li> The teardrop shape was good, the others were terrible.</li>
    <li> The items are fine for the price...the tan sponge is a little harder than the other...but the smell is awful! Hopefully it&#x27;ll go away!</li>
    <li> I love these They are a great buy!!!! Im so glad I purchased them. I abosolutely love these!! very good quality</li>
    <li> They took a whole month too get here. And they are very small lol.. But they actually work good( if they are dry the suck up all your makeup, but if u wet it, it works very nice) it doesn&#x27;t make me look like a cake even if i wear a lot of foundation because it distributes it well! I just don&#x27;t recommend it for bb creams or tinted moisturizers because the sponge does take a lot of the product so  it wouldn&#x27;t give u coverage! And it does have a funky smell so i wouldnt give it as a gift! but i would buy it for myself since the smell doesnt bother me. Hope this was helpful :)</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re a bit too firm. Even when I soak it, the sponge is very firm making it a little hard to apply the liquid foundation. Before these I was using regular makeup wedges which took forever, so these are better in that they don&#x27;t take as long</li>
    <li> I love these, they do seem pretty hard but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> Lasts a very long time..ordered three and got 4 instead. .I Can&#x27;t complain</li>
    <li> Great product for price paid. They do not come wrapped...so be advise they were shipped loose in the envelope we received them in. However, they perform as expected.</li>
    <li> pretty good deal! and fun and easy to use!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s prefect and works well</li>
    <li> the product is very good infact it was better than anticipated.</li>
    <li> very great product for such a great price!</li>
    <li> Good quality, fast shipping, was exactly as described and was packaged nicely.</li>
