<ol>
      <li>The best egyptian musk oil I have ever purchased!</li>
      <li>Love it !!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Smell is beautiful</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Great deal for the amount you get.  </li>
      <li>Can wear it anywhere and feel good.</li>
      <li>They all have their good points.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still good.  </li>
      <li>My search for a good replacement continues.</li>
      <li>It had the best scent, and the size of the bottle is extremely generous for the price, so this is a GREAT value!  </li>
      <li>Wonderfully authentic Egyptian musk scent!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this scent!</li>
      <li>It took a week to recieve and it came with a roll on cap (which I am kind of bummed about)</li>
      <li>However, the scent isn&#x27;t musk of any kind.</li>
      <li>(I do appreciate it is not a roller top</li>
      <li>I still order E Musk from MANY sellers.  </li>
      <li>Since I have been wearing it, more and more people ask me what I am wearing.  </li>
      <li>I have placed another order for more.</li>
      <li>I have been wearing Egyptian Musk for many years now, and I truly love it.  </li>
      <li>and I love the scent.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend loves Egyptian Musk and can&#x27;t find it anywhere, I ordered this product and it was perfect, it did not have a roller-ball top and was a huge amount that will last him for years.  </li>
      <li>pleasantly scented- thick- perfect! &amp; quick delivery</li>
      <li>:) Thank you Smoking Joe&#x27;s:) I will absolutely  be a repeat customer:):)</li>
      <li>Caroline.&lt;br /&gt;Mixes awesomely with any other scent you like also.&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
      <li>The real thing smells amazing.</li>
      <li>That would be fantastic.</li>
      <li>It still doesn&#x27;t have as good a scent as my old Egyptian Musk did, and I feel that it lacks staying power.  </li>
      <li>Because of the good experience I had with the company, I felt confident to order other items.</li>
      <li>My quest for true egyptian musk continues....</li>
      <li>I recently ordered from 3 different Amazon sellers, and out of the three, this one was the best.  </li>
      <li>Smells very much like the original oil</li>
      <li>That being said, I will keep searching and trying others, but I would definitely purchase this oil again in the meantime, unless or until I find a better one!</li>
      <li>it smells so fresh</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty good but not quite the same smell as the more expensive Egyptian musk but a good buy for the money.</li>
      <li>I like it very much and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
      <li>if you want Smokin Joes, make sure to buy from smokin joes - hahaleveryday does not actually sell it!!  </li>
      <li>receive so many compliments daily or inquiries what  are you wearing  ?</li>
      <li>This fragrance is is one of my favorite, although this particular product was not as strong as I expected yet</li>
      <li>As it turned out, my order came from a place located in the town next to mine, and yet, it took a full 10 days for me to receive my order from them!  </li>
      <li>however the bottle is a lot bigger than what would&#x27;ve been available at Whole Foods, for instance.</li>
      <li>It is flowery, very perfume-y.</li>
      <li>The REAL Smoking Joe&#x27;s Egyptian Musk Body Oil is now called Claudia&#x27;s Incense.</li>
      <li>Very pleasing odor.  </li>
      <li>so I and those close to me can enjoy the aroma all day long.</li>
      <li>A little more flowery than egyptian musk.  </li>
      <li>I would normally get if I was in the States -</li>
      <li>You have to put your nose right up next to your skin to smell it at all.  </li>
      <li>Not only that, the bottle came with the top loose and 1/2 the bottle spilled out.</li>
      <li>It reminds me more of White Linen perfume that my mother wears which isn&#x27;t remotely a musky type perfume and nothing like Egyptian Musk should smell.</li>
      <li>The company is NOT Smoking Joe&#x27;s but if I find a likable scent that Halal Everyday offers in the future, I would order from them.</li>
      <li>I searched quite some time and read the various reviews to find real Egyptian Musk Oil.</li>
      <li>Appears I will be able to refill my roll-on applicator at least twice from this purchase.</li>
      <li>Heavily perfumed and smells nothing like the original scent.</li>
      <li>A subtle and exotic musk</li>
      <li>First it came in the same type of bottle as the fragrance oil used for a room dispenser, the only difference was the size.</li>
      <li>I normally don&#x27;t get asked that question with regular fragrances.  </li>
      <li>but the label says Smoking Joe&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;The new bottle has different branding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product smells more like Egyptian Goddess than Egyptian Musk, but with ALOT MORE BASE OIL.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been on a mad search for a good one since the local store where I used to purchase it is no longer open.  </li>

<li> A drop goes a long long way.</li>
<li> and as it is an essential oil, a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> BODY Oil is kinda pricey but is thick and comes in an octagonal bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Scent is on KEY and long lasting.  </li>
<li> ; you will get a scent that gets you more compliments than any expensive scent, from men.&lt;br /&gt;Favorite scent of the late Mrs.JFK Jr.;</li>
<li> With my prior oil I could still smell it at the end of the day, this one seems to wear off after a few hours.  </li>
<li> It is an oil, not watered down.</li>
<li> I would not go so far as to say I HATE it, but, I would definitely NOT advise anyone else to make the same mistake I did in purchasing it!</li>
<li> relatively little cash</li>
<li> little silage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
<li> It has become weakened and is just a bottle of heavy oil, I will not order from this seller again.</li>
<li> I had searched a few stores in my city for this scent and it was either sold out or not available.</li>
<li> Product has a thick consistency... not watered down.</li>
<li> Of course it is not my usual</li>
<li> This oil was really really thick also....</li>
<li> and so the arrival time was ridiculous!</li>
<li> Again, not good!</li>
<li> Halaleveryday puts out an awful product, which is not the product pictured on this amazon page (at least, as of this review), and takes an incredibly long time to get your shipment to you.</li>
<li> After about a half hour all I can smell is base oil.</li>
<li> The scent is very weak.  </li>
<li> I ordered the 1 oz bottle of Smokin Joes egyptian musk in a plain glass bottle (because i absolutely HATE the roller topped bottles), just as pictured on the page, and what i got instead, was an unnamed brand (presumably, HalalEveryDay brand), which smells awful - like flowers - and it is in a roller bottle.  </li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
<li> Terrible seller!</li>
<li> Terrible product!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product smells more like Egyptian Goddess than Egyptian Musk, but with ALOT MORE BASE OIL. After about a half hour all I can smell is base oil. I will not be ordering from halal every day again and I don&#x27;t think this is what Smoking Joe&#x27;s oil&#x27;s are supposed to smell or last like.</li>
    <li> The product is not the same as shown...scent is not \\&quot;true\\&quot; egyptian musk.  A little more flowery than egyptian musk.  My quest for true egyptian musk continues....</li>
    <li> These people know how to make essential oils! The best egyptian musk oil I have ever purchased! pleasantly scented- thick- perfect! &amp; quick delivery:) Thank you Smoking Joe&#x27;s:) I will absolutely  be a repeat customer:):)</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves Egyptian Musk and can&#x27;t find it anywhere, I ordered this product and it was perfect, it did not have a roller-ball top and was a huge amount that will last him for years.  Great deal for the amount you get.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love it !!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell is beautiful an fresh&lt;br /&gt;I receive so many compliments daily or inquiries what  are you wearing  ?</li>
    <li> I had searched a few stores in my city for this scent and it was either sold out or not available. It took a week to recieve and it came with a roll on cap (which I am kind of bummed about) however the bottle is a lot bigger than what would&#x27;ve been available at Whole Foods, for instance. The bottle has a homemade label. The company is NOT Smoking Joe&#x27;s but if I find a likable scent that Halal Everyday offers in the future, I would order from them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good but not quite the same smell as the more expensive Egyptian musk but a good buy for the money.</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews, I ordered this perfume oil smell unsmelled, and it smelled heavenly, just what I remembered the oil I had bought years ago. Not only that, the bottle came with the top loose and 1/2 the bottle spilled out. I informed the seller Halaleveryday and they promptly sent me another bottle to replace it. Because of the good experience I had with the company, I felt confident to order other items.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this scent! Since I have been wearing it, more and more people ask me what I am wearing.  I normally don&#x27;t get asked that question with regular fragrances.  I have placed another order for more.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone. However, I would lie if there was multiple options on size! That would be fantastic.</li>
    <li> The REAL Smoking Joe&#x27;s Egyptian Musk Body Oil is now called Claudia&#x27;s Incense. There was a change of owners I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a &#x27;test buy&#x27; and ordered 1oz of the BODY Oil and 2 oz of the FRAGRANCE oil.  The FRAGRANCE oil is thinner with little silage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BODY Oil is kinda pricey but is thick and comes in an octagonal bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Scent is on KEY and long lasting.  So sometimes BODY oils are stronger than FRAGRANCE oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a botlle from 2008 and it&#x27;s still good.  That is the same one I ordered here but the label says Smoking Joe&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;The new bottle has different branding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give might check it out of you want Egyptian Musk that smells it used to circa 1988.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the interim I still order E Musk from MANY sellers.  They all have their good points.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Egyptian Musk for many years now, and I truly love it.  I&#x27;ve been on a mad search for a good one since the local store where I used to purchase it is no longer open.  I recently ordered from 3 different Amazon sellers, and out of the three, this one was the best.  It had the best scent, and the size of the bottle is extremely generous for the price, so this is a GREAT value!  It still doesn&#x27;t have as good a scent as my old Egyptian Musk did, and I feel that it lacks staying power.  With my prior oil I could still smell it at the end of the day, this one seems to wear off after a few hours.  That being said, I will keep searching and trying others, but I would definitely purchase this oil again in the meantime, unless or until I find a better one!</li>
    <li> Since moving to Japan - I realized there was no body oil dealer here. So, I had to go online and order my Egyptian Musk. Of course it is not my usual I would normally get if I was in the States - but it is close. It is an oil, not watered down. I would recommend this purchase. Also, it came to me overseas within a week.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 1 oz bottle of Smokin Joes egyptian musk in a plain glass bottle (because i absolutely HATE the roller topped bottles), just as pictured on the page, and what i got instead, was an unnamed brand (presumably, HalalEveryDay brand), which smells awful - like flowers - and it is in a roller bottle.  As it turned out, my order came from a place located in the town next to mine, and yet, it took a full 10 days for me to receive my order from them!  Halaleveryday puts out an awful product, which is not the product pictured on this amazon page (at least, as of this review), and takes an incredibly long time to get your shipment to you. Terrible seller! Terrible product! if you want Smokin Joes, make sure to buy from smokin joes - hahaleveryday does not actually sell it!!  Bait and switch!  Shame on amazon for allowing it!</li>
    <li> Wonderfully authentic Egyptian musk scent!</li>
    <li> I know i will be purchasing this product again. It is so earth, and suttle. Can wear it anywhere and feel good.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. I searched quite some time and read the various reviews to find real Egyptian Musk Oil. The real thing smells amazing. A subtle and exotic musk and as it is an essential oil, a little goes a long way. I got my last bottle at a Garden Botanica shop in the mall years ago and they&#x27;re long gone so I came here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I placed my order and what I received was an unlabeled bottle, as pictured (I do appreciate it is not a roller top so I can mix it as is my wont into lotions and such). However, the scent isn&#x27;t musk of any kind. It is flowery, very perfume-y. It reminds me more of White Linen perfume that my mother wears which isn&#x27;t remotely a musky type perfume and nothing like Egyptian Musk should smell. Because this product is unlabeled, I don&#x27;t know if this was another scent meant for someone else and sent to me, but this is not the musk I ordered and I will not order from them again. My search for a good replacement continues.</li>
    <li> This product may say egyptian musk on the label, but it in no way resembles that on the inside.  Heavily perfumed and smells nothing like the original scent.</li>
    <li> Again, not good! both oils were shipped together (premium concentrated E-musk fragrance 2oz) and so the arrival time was ridiculous! This oil was really really thick also....I would not go so far as to say I HATE it, but, I would definitely NOT advise anyone else to make the same mistake I did in purchasing it!</li>
    <li> Egyptian Musk oil is a well kept secret.&lt;br /&gt;For relatively little cash; you will get a scent that gets you more compliments than any expensive scent, from men.&lt;br /&gt;Favorite scent of the late Mrs.JFK Jr.; Caroline.&lt;br /&gt;Mixes awesomely with any other scent you like also.&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting. A drop goes a long long way.</li>
    <li> This is not the product I remember. First it came in the same type of bottle as the fragrance oil used for a room dispenser, the only difference was the size. Used 3 times and the oil has lost its potency. It has become weakened and is just a bottle of heavy oil, I will not order from this seller again. Advise you not to either.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is is one of my favorite, although this particular product was not as strong as I expected yet I like it very much and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Smells very much like the original oil I used to purchase 30 yrs ago from NYC street vendors.</li>
    <li> The scent is very weak.  You have to put your nose right up next to your skin to smell it at all.  I&#x27;m very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Very pleasing odor.  I use a splash on my neck so I and those close to me can enjoy the aroma all day long. Product has a thick consistency... not watered down. Appears I will be able to refill my roll-on applicator at least twice from this purchase.</li>
    <li> it smells so fresh and I love the scent. Great product. I recommend it and would buy it again.</li>
