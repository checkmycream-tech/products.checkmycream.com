### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>so I cut the bottom off and it fits perfectly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to put in my curlers and use while I&#x27;m on the computer.</li>
      <li>This works great and saved me money since I do not need to buy a separate bonnet dryer now.</li>
      <li>I am so happy with it....</li>
      <li>Happy with the product.</li>
      <li>The people who work for the company must have written the good reviews.  </li>
      <li>Considering that this item was being shipped from China, I think it was good.  </li>
      <li>Well I guess it&#x27;s good for the price-</li>
      <li>It fits snugly around the original Carel hose and works perfect for drying my hair.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this item.</li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>The pressure from the air blowing out of my hair dryer makes it kind of float upward</li>
      <li>You get what you pay for, but honestly I did expect to use it once.</li>
      <li>I took my dryer hose and threaded it through the bonnet hose, thereby creating a seal and delivery the heat appropriately to the bonnet.</li>
      <li>otherwise it&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to get a nice fit.</li>
      <li>For the most part the air is distributed evenly.</li>
      <li>I am glad I did purchase it</li>
      <li>I love this bonnet and would purchase it again.  </li>
      <li>Good for a laugh, though.</li>
      <li>When i open the package, i was surprise by the good quality of the materials of this product, very nice.</li>
      <li>I was very happy with it and thank the previous positive reviews!!!</li>
      <li>It certainly does get hot, even on the hair dryer&#x27;s lowest setting, but it still did a great job of heat setting the hair color we were using it for.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had the hair dryer for years and since the motor was fine, I just wanted to replace the plastic bonnet.</li>
      <li>dries my hair really quickly though!</li>
      <li>but it was cheap</li>
      <li>It was cheap</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with the item, and may order another one just to have available, as this baby is priceless IMO--not that I&#x27;m epxecting it to tear up, but just simply out the fact, that it took me so long to find something like this.</li>
      <li>The original one was plastic, and&lt;br /&gt;was</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not flexible and material is super cheap.</li>
      <li>fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the company and they quickly offered to replace it.  </li>
      <li>I really appreciate this product because it gets the job done and is comfortable too.</li>
      <li>The hose fit very snugly on my hairdryer and does not slip off during use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay so far.  </li>
      <li>But for price, it was worth it.</li>
      <li>so now you&#x27;re out your original money and stuck with an item you really don&#x27;t want.</li>
      <li>Right now it will just have to do.</li>
      <li>Set it up, put it on my head, turned on the hairdryer and it blew right off.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it my hair dryer overheated.</li>
      <li>I wanted this so I can do a hot oil treatment, the hood is probably taller than needed but it works.</li>
      <li>This item took about two weeks to arrive, and the first one had a defect.  </li>
      <li>It does get really hot on the side that the tube brings the air in</li>
      <li>It do get hot.</li>
      <li>If anyone wants something that is &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; yet very functional, this is something worth considering.</li>
      <li>its ok , i dont feel like my hair gets completely dry</li>
      <li>The plastic piece that lets you make it smaller and fit to your head does get hot at which point I just pull it away from my head for a moment.</li>
      <li>It absolutely meets my need, I attempted to find another soft bonnet for my Gold&#x27;n&#x27; Hot soft bonnet dryer with no luck, you can read my review on the replacement cap for the Gold &#x27;n&#x27; Hot dryer---it was absolute garbage!!!</li>
      <li>I did also have the dryer on high, which I learned is just too hot.  </li>
      <li>it straight</li>
      <li>I will attempt to attach a video review that I did on this item, so that you can really see how I am using it.</li>
      <li>as a hairstylist this product has helped me so much ..</li>
      <li>but it is good when im doing hot oil treatments or trying to jumpstart a dry on a wet bantu knot</li>
      <li>I have to buy a lightweight blow dryer to use with it because mine is too powerful and hot for it (1875 watts on low heat).  </li>
      <li>so I have to hold the top down.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten use to Amazon and its vendors delivering in a week or less for the most part</li>
      <li>head gets very hot very quickly though so have to do a bit of on and off action every few seconds....</li>
      <li>It does the job far cheaper than a hood and stores very compactly.  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have much hair and small curlers, it should work ok.</li>
      <li>The packaging and product were brand new.  </li>
      <li>They sent a new one, which again took about two weeks.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much more fragile than I expected it to be.  </li>
      <li>Not big enough to fit over my curlers.</li>
      <li>If you aren&#x27;t ready to make an expensive commitment to drying your hair in this manner, this is a good item to try before purchasing a hood.</li>
      <li>I found a cheaper and higher quality brand in my local beauty supply store.</li>
      <li>I use it once or twice a month when doing a deep condition or hot oil treatment.  </li>
      <li>The previous reviews were accurate.  </li>
      <li>What the description does not tell you is that it only fits a certain size of rollers.</li>
      <li>If not, then I will get a complete unit in place of this portable setup I tried here.</li>
      <li>I think its called a barrel or toggle drawstring, but its not the flimsy shoelace tie that gathered the bonnet together of my old unit.</li>
      <li>For that reason she wouldn&#x27;t use this at home on a regular basis, but it&#x27;s a reasonable alternative to use when travelling.</li>
      <li>The material used in the attachment is soft and probably wont crack like the one it is replacing.  </li>
      <li>was searching for a replacement soft bonnet for my Carel hair dryer.</li>
      <li>It takes about an hour to dry my thick hair on medium setting, but if I were brave enough to use the high setting, it wouldn&#x27;t take so long.</li>
      <li>It is not as comfortable as sitting under a hood, as the hair dryer seems louder than a hood and it can get pretty hot in this bonnet with just a few small holes for vents.</li>
      <li>I was hesitant considering the item was made in China but have no regrets whatsoever.  </li>
      <li>We received this bonnet in a very timely manner and the quality is like I expected it to be.</li>
      <li>It can get hot even on low setting of blow dryer so be careful.</li>
      <li>Buyer Beware, items comes directly from China, apparently no local distributor, so they offer you $3.00 plus American Dollars if you want to return</li>
      <li>It was a bit awkward at first to get the correct fit but after adjusting it a bit on my head</li>
      <li>It gets very hot inside even with the dryer on a low heat setting, which I guess is because it is sealed, whereas the hard hood she uses at home is open at the bottom</li>
      <li>Only issue I had was that the elastic was so tight at the bottom (where the hair dryer inserts) that it was hard fitting it over my hair dryer</li>
      <li>Besides I&#x27;ve wasted more money on lesser things, the item actually arrived earlier than expected, I think they initially quoted me a 3-4 week delivery time as it was coming from overseas--which I initially thought was ridiculous, as we live in world of instance gratification</li>

<li> Using it daily and with my long hair</li>
<li> Complete waste of $$$</li>
<li> I started searching and could not find another Carel bonnet, so, I bought this one which is made of durable nylon, and has a long hose, with an elastic closure at the end of the hose.</li>
<li> I never blow dry my hair,I try to keep away from my hair at all times.</li>
<li> I dont have no relaxer or perm in my hair,I want to blow dry</li>
<li> This Bonnet size is limited.</li>
<li> I want to put the larger size rollers in my hair and it is such an tight fit with this dryer, almost impossible actually!</li>
<li> , I figured I didn&#x27;t have much to lose as it was approximately $7-$8 (including shipping and handling).</li>
<li> Money well spent.  </li>
<li> but I guess that is to be expected.</li>
<li> Im having a hard time keeping it on my head as the drawstring not tight.</li>
<li> Bonnet fits Small and medium size rollers only, if your hair grows and you need larger rollers, the bonnet will not fit.</li>
<li> I use the hard end ring, which I left on the end</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received the item earlier than the scheduled date.  I love it!  Using it daily and with my long hair it helps a lot.  Will recommend to buy this product.</li>
    <li> This item took about two weeks to arrive, and the first one had a defect.  The rings that hold the tube open were squished and defective, making it hard to get air through.  The first time I used it my hair dryer overheated. I did also have the dryer on high, which I learned is just too hot.  It needs to be on the low setting for heat and fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the company and they quickly offered to replace it.  They sent a new one, which again took about two weeks.  This one was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material seems sturdy enough, and it has a drawstring type closure with a toggle to hold it on.  Otherwise it will blow off of your head.  It is not as comfortable as sitting under a hood, as the hair dryer seems louder than a hood and it can get pretty hot in this bonnet with just a few small holes for vents. The hose fit very snugly on my hairdryer and does not slip off during use. It does the job far cheaper than a hood and stores very compactly.  If you aren&#x27;t ready to make an expensive commitment to drying your hair in this manner, this is a good item to try before purchasing a hood.</li>
    <li> I love this bonnet and would purchase it again.  The material used in the attachment is soft and probably wont crack like the one it is replacing.  I use it at least one a week.  I am very pleased with this item.</li>
    <li> Not big enough to fit over my curlers. If you don&#x27;t have much hair and small curlers, it should work ok.</li>
    <li> it works!  head gets very hot very quickly though so have to do a bit of on and off action every few seconds....dries my hair really quickly though!</li>
    <li> I really appreciate this product because it gets the job done and is comfortable too. I have not tried it on with rollers but the cap seems big enough for that plus the elastic band holds when adjusted to head size.</li>
    <li> The people who work for the company must have written the good reviews.  Couldn&#x27;t get the thing to stay on my head.  Complete waste of $$$</li>
    <li> was searching for a replacement soft bonnet for my Carel hair dryer. The original one was plastic, and&lt;br /&gt;was tearing apart from weekly use. I&#x27;ve had the hair dryer for years and since the motor was fine, I just wanted to replace the plastic bonnet. I started searching and could not find another Carel bonnet, so, I bought this one which is made of durable nylon, and has a long hose, with an elastic closure at the end of the hose. It fits snugly around the original Carel hose and works perfect for drying my hair.</li>
    <li> Happy with the product. Only issue I had was that the elastic was so tight at the bottom (where the hair dryer inserts) that it was hard fitting it over my hair dryer but I did manage to insert the dryer into the tube. I like the way the product works.</li>
    <li> I thought coming from China, it would take forever...but NO, got it in just a few days considering I ordered it during the holidays.  The packaging and product were brand new.  I am so happy with it....</li>
    <li> I wanted this so I can do a hot oil treatment, the hood is probably taller than needed but it works. The plastic piece that lets you make it smaller and fit to your head does get hot at which point I just pull it away from my head for a moment.</li>
    <li> Considering that this item was being shipped from China, I think it was good.  I was hesitant considering the item was made in China but have no regrets whatsoever.  If anyone wants something that is &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; yet very functional, this is something worth considering. I would definitely recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> Well I guess it&#x27;s good for the price- as they say you get what you pay for. The hose slips off my blow dryer .</li>
    <li> I bought this Silver Salon Barber Soft Hair Dryer Bonnet Hood Attachment, hoping was help me during my hair treatments but it has an awful design, I wasted my money on this.</li>
    <li> Not satisfied.  I received the bonnet within the time it was supposed to be delivered .  When I finally want to use it, it broke as I tried to put the end over my drier!  Overall, the piece is made of shoddy materials and poor workmanship.  You get what you pay for, but honestly I did expect to use it once. Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I found a cheaper and higher quality brand in my local beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> i look stupid as all h#ll but its ok , i dont feel like my hair gets completely dry but it is good when im doing hot oil treatments or trying to jumpstart a dry on a wet bantu knot</li>
    <li> This Bonnet size is limited. What the description does not tell you is that it only fits a certain size of rollers. Bonnet fits Small and medium size rollers only, if your hair grows and you need larger rollers, the bonnet will not fit. It&#x27;s not flexible and material is super cheap. Not worth buying. Buyer Beware, items comes directly from China, apparently no local distributor, so they offer you $3.00 plus American Dollars if you want to return so now you&#x27;re out your original money and stuck with an item you really don&#x27;t want.</li>
    <li> Im having a hard time keeping it on my head as the drawstring not tight. With patience it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> once blow dryer is attached even with string tied it falls off my head. otherwise it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> falls apart after like 8 uses. but it was cheap so whatever.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter to use when travelling. She uses a hood dryer at home, but obviously we can&#x27;t pack that in a suitcase!  We received this bonnet in a very timely manner and the quality is like I expected it to be. It gets very hot inside even with the dryer on a low heat setting, which I guess is because it is sealed, whereas the hard hood she uses at home is open at the bottom so the heat doesn&#x27;t build up. For that reason she wouldn&#x27;t use this at home on a regular basis, but it&#x27;s a reasonable alternative to use when travelling.</li>
    <li> Set it up, put it on my head, turned on the hairdryer and it blew right off. Good for a laugh, though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay so far.  It&#x27;s much more fragile than I expected it to be.  I have to buy a lightweight blow dryer to use with it because mine is too powerful and hot for it (1875 watts on low heat).  It would melt the hose.  This should work out, I hope.  If not, then I will get a complete unit in place of this portable setup I tried here.</li>
    <li> The previous reviews were accurate.  I took a chance on this based on the reviews because I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money.  I was very happy with it and thank the previous positive reviews!!!</li>
    <li> It absolutely meets my need, I attempted to find another soft bonnet for my Gold&#x27;n&#x27; Hot soft bonnet dryer with no luck, you can read my review on the replacement cap for the Gold &#x27;n&#x27; Hot dryer---it was absolute garbage!!! I again went on another quest to find another replacement cap and came across this baby, I figured I didn&#x27;t have much to lose as it was approximately $7-$8 (including shipping and handling). Besides I&#x27;ve wasted more money on lesser things, the item actually arrived earlier than expected, I think they initially quoted me a 3-4 week delivery time as it was coming from overseas--which I initially thought was ridiculous, as we live in world of instance gratification and I&#x27;ve gotten use to Amazon and its vendors delivering in a week or less for the most part but I digress. Anyway I had a hard bonnet dryer to hold me over until the soft bonnet arrived, I only use my soft bonnet when I don&#x27;t want to be stuck within the confines of my bathroom. I took my dryer hose and threaded it through the bonnet hose, thereby creating a seal and delivery the heat appropriately to the bonnet. I also like the drawstring on this item. I think its called a barrel or toggle drawstring, but its not the flimsy shoelace tie that gathered the bonnet together of my old unit. I am very satisfied with the item, and may order another one just to have available, as this baby is priceless IMO--not that I&#x27;m epxecting it to tear up, but just simply out the fact, that it took me so long to find something like this. I also like the material it has a satiny type finish not plastic, which I like, because you don&#x27;t have to worry about the plastic degrading over time. I will attempt to attach a video review that I did on this item, so that you can really see how I am using it.</li>
    <li> I want to put the larger size rollers in my hair and it is such an tight fit with this dryer, almost impossible actually! Right now it will just have to do. It does get really hot on the side that the tube brings the air in but I guess that is to be expected. For the most part the air is distributed evenly. Shipping also took a while. It was cheap so that&#x27;s one plus.</li>
    <li> I never blow dry my hair,I try to keep away from my hair at all times.I dont have no relaxer or perm in my hair,I want to blow dry it straight I said no way.I only use my blow dry  for  deep conditioners only..This do work well,I got on low,I have to hold that cap down,It just blow it off my head,No the tie dont work,It will just blow it also.I have to hold the dryer and cap.It do get hot.I am glad I did purchase it</li>
    <li> I love this! I use this with a deep conditioning treatment and also the Sebastian Laminates to do at home. This works great and saved me money since I do not need to buy a separate bonnet dryer now. The bonnet cap is a durable material and keeps the heat well distributed within the cap just like at a hair salon. It was a bit awkward at first to get the correct fit but after adjusting it a bit on my head I&#x27;m able to get a nice fit. It would travel well too although I plan on just using it at home. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> It certainly does get hot, even on the hair dryer&#x27;s lowest setting, but it still did a great job of heat setting the hair color we were using it for. We just used it for a bit, then gave it a rest, rinse, repeat.</li>
    <li> Works quite well! I was pleasantly surprised to see it was a sturdy thick material and seems very durable. It&#x27;s great to put in my curlers and use while I&#x27;m on the computer. It takes about an hour to dry my thick hair on medium setting, but if I were brave enough to use the high setting, it wouldn&#x27;t take so long.</li>
    <li> When i open the package, i was surprise by the good quality of the materials of this product, very nice.</li>
    <li> It works well. There is temp control as I knew when I bought. But for price, it was worth it. It can get hot even on low setting of blow dryer so be careful.</li>
    <li> It does not stay on my head well.  The pressure from the air blowing out of my hair dryer makes it kind of float upward so I have to hold the top down.  I recommend getting a bonnet with the chin strap cord. Otherwise it does the job I bought it for.</li>
    <li> This works really simply.  I attach it to my blow dryer and instant sit under dryer for a fraction of the salon price.  I use it once or twice a month when doing a deep condition or hot oil treatment.  Took a while to get here but I knew that when I ordered it.  I&#x27;m getting one for my mom.</li>
    <li> Such a simple thing but just what I was looking for.  Money well spent.  It end would not fit over my hair dryer so I cut the bottom off and it fits perfectly. I use the hard end ring, which I left on the end and I just hold it in place while I read a magazine.</li>
    <li> as a hairstylist this product has helped me so much .. THANK YOU</li>
