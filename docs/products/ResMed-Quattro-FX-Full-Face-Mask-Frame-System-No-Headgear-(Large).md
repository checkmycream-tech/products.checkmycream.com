      <li>I am used to a better quality full face mask but its a good backup</li>
      <li>I ordered the mask in a large to cover my nose and mouth and it works great.  </li>

      <li>and I am sleeping much better with it.  </li>
      <li>i love it.</li>
      <li>I SLEEP WITH THIS MASK NIGHTLY, I LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>Be sure to follow the instructions as how to put it on.  </li>
      <li>A nasal mask or a CPAP pillow would probably be better for that.</li>
      <li>mask would have been much better if it was made from the gel.</li>
      <li>The mask is also very easy to clean.</li>
      <li>much better fit and fewer leaks</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve become very dependent on this mask for a good night sleep that I cant sleep without it.</li>
      <li>Very responsible, fast shipping and a great product.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the excellent customer service offered by old reliable - they were quick to respond to my questions and to make sure I had the proper fitting mask.</li>
      <li>Too many air leaks which I found very intolerable, so I ceased using this mask very quickly.</li>
      <li>Full Face Mask  </li>
      <li>I switched to this mask because I had the full head gear mask</li>
      <li>I found Philips Respironics Amara Full face works for me..</li>
      <li>maybe bacause i didnt use the right headgear.</li>
      <li>The cushion&#x27;s supportive, inner layer stabilizes the cushion while the soft, outer membrane gently inflates to create a safe and secure seal against the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>have a Large Res Med Mirage Quattro full face mask which I purchased in Australia , after going thru your catalogue there was none , so I requested the Quattro FX - male, nowhere near as good as the Res Med Mirage</li>
      <li>I was able to pick and choose from a verity of different ones.</li>
      <li>The mask works pretty well.</li>
      <li>This was exactly what I needed without the hassle.</li>
      <li>just OK, after wearing for a couple weeks I went back to my Mirage....</li>
      <li>When I picked up my CPAP and mask for the first time.</li>
      <li>i open my mouth at night and this mask works for me better than the nasal mask</li>
      <li>The Res Med Mirage Quattro is a better fit with less noise and LEAKAGES , much comfortable deep sleep!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I bought this from the size chart provided by the manufacturer, and have found the mask to be uncomfortably large.  </li>
      <li>I bought this large size face mask to replace the medium sized mask that I received with my CPAP machine.</li>
      <li>the fit and strap is totally different</li>
      <li>The mask seals very well if you follow the instructions for adjusting and putting the mask on.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>The shipping was very prompt and the mask came in a box, not an envelope.  </li>
      <li>Leaks constantly especially near eyes</li>
      <li>really has made a difference.</li>
      <li>These mask (especially the cushion) do not last but 6 to 8 months of comfortable fit.</li>
      <li>outward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Most of the times from pressing down on the pillow</li>
      <li>The dog chewed up the cpap, and I really, really didn&#x27;t want to have to do another sleep test just to get a new prescription.</li>
      <li>I did need to learn how to &amp;#34;seat&amp;#34; the top part of the mask around my nose, since that part is a little larger than I would like, but in the end I wish that it hadn&#x27;t taken me four months to try this, and that my medical provider had been more helpful.</li>
      <li>and I had high hopes for</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend you try this mask</li>
      <li>The Quattro FX&#x27;s dual-wall Spring AirTM cushion provides soft, even pressure distribution around the nose and mouth absorbing even the slightest user movements.</li>
      <li>then the normal cpap.</li>
      <li>Since my medical provider wasn&#x27;t too much help, I decided to experiment and bought this large size mask from Amazon.</li>
      <li>When I have the funds I will be purchasing either a new style, nasal mouth hybrid, or medium.</li>
      <li>As a result of that, I wasn&#x27;t sleeping particularly well and the mask was less comfortable than I thought it should be.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t do much to stop it from shifting, unless you cinch it down so tight it hurts, you can do better!</li>
      <li>For mouth breathers, this is really the only viable option.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That is far from the truth.</li>
      <li>These mask normally cost $169 to $180 at the medical equipment supply.</li>
      <li>After getting used to the new size (a few days), I found myself sleeping for 5 or more hours without waking (compared with 2-3 hours with the medium size mask) because this one is long enough that my bottom lip stays well inside the frame even when my mouth is open.</li>
      <li>as many of the people giving this mask a poor review have done.  </li>

    <li> My insurance company is taking forever to send me this so I bought it myself. It&#x27;s simple and comes with the cushion piece. You should consider purchasing additional cushion pieces too.</li>
    <li> The Res Med Mirage Quattro is a better fit with less noise and LEAKAGES , much comfortable deep sleep!&lt;br /&gt;I have a Large Res Med Mirage Quattro full face mask which I purchased in Australia , after going thru your catalogue there was none , so I requested the Quattro FX - male, nowhere near as good as the Res Med Mirage Quattro.&lt;br /&gt;Any how , Thank You for the request for feedback . Please pass on to the Res Med Sales team .&lt;br /&gt;I will be using your services at a later date.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You again ,  John Peel</li>
    <li> Perfect fit. Fast shipping. Arrived with headgear.</li>
    <li> too small for large face</li>
    <li> I SLEEP WITH THIS MASK NIGHTLY, I LOVE IT.</li>

    <li> I have used these for years and this one is very light and foursome reason i did not like to.  I am used to a better quality full face mask but its a good backup</li>
    <li> Mask is well designed and fits well. I am still getting used to having something cover my mouth and nose</li>
    <li> After some time(4 hours) the mask seems to leak air to the outside, making enough noise to wake my wife.</li>
    <li> i have a bad experiance with the item maybe bacause i didnt use the right headgear. it keeps moving and had many problem with it.</li>
    <li> use it every night.. works great  .. i open my mouth at night and this mask works for me better than the nasal mask</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t do much to stop it from shifting, unless you cinch it down so tight it hurts, you can do better!</li>
    <li> the fit and strap is totally different then the normal cpap. i love it. dog hates it. lol  really has made a difference.</li>
    <li> Item fantastic, transaction flawless !&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Too many air leaks which I found very intolerable, so I ceased using this mask very quickly. #wastedmoney</li>
    <li> just OK, after wearing for a couple weeks I went back to my Mirage....much better fit and fewer leaks</li>
    <li> Very responsible, fast shipping and a great product.</li>
    <li> These mask (especially the cushion) do not last but 6 to 8 months of comfortable fit. These is a great price!  These mask normally cost $169 to $180 at the medical equipment supply.</li>
    <li> Mask fits snugly and didn&#x27;t slip off during the night like some others I have tried. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the excellent customer service offered by old reliable - they were quick to respond to my questions and to make sure I had the proper fitting mask.</li>
    <li> great product and service</li>
    <li> ResMed Mirage Quattro FX&lt;br /&gt;Pro- Well made.&lt;br /&gt;Con- Shaped like a pyramid. To wide in the noise area.&lt;br /&gt;Con- Mask sets on my cheek bones. Rocks up and down on the cheek bones.&lt;br /&gt;  Will not seal at pressure of 11 or above.&lt;br /&gt;  Tighten head gear so not stretch was left.. Uncomfortable and still leeks.&lt;br /&gt;Note: Had the same trouble with the Mirage Quattro Full Face Mask  version.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: If the mask sets on your cheek bones look for a different mask.&lt;br /&gt; I found Philips Respironics Amara Full face works for me.. Well made and fits well.</li>
    <li> Cpap mask- I ordered the mask in a large to cover my nose and mouth and it works great.  I had a mask that had a forehead piece and it was hard to sleep on my side.  The mask seals very well if you follow the instructions for adjusting and putting the mask on.  With this mask you don’t have that and it is very comfortable to sleep in any position.  Be sure to follow the instructions as how to put it on.  If you do not follow the instructions you will not get a good seal as many of the people giving this mask a poor review have done.  My only concern is the small plastic piece where the head gear attaches; it is very thin but flexible.  I have had this mask for 3 days now and I am sleeping much better with it.  The shipping was very prompt and the mask came in a box, not an envelope.  I would highly recommend you try this mask you will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> Great product and comfortable even for me.</li>
    <li> This mask was bought for my husband and this is his review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a good looking mask and I had high hopes for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product description states The Quattro FX&#x27;s dual-wall Spring AirTM cushion provides soft, even pressure distribution around the nose and mouth absorbing even the slightest user movements. The cushion&#x27;s supportive, inner layer stabilizes the cushion while the soft, outer membrane gently inflates to create a safe and secure seal against the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is far from the truth. The mask skirt is uncomfortable there is nothing soft about it. The mask slides upward due to the way the head straps are designed. This also allows the mask to leak around the mouth. The mask also leaks around the top/bridge of the nose. To get it to stop leaking you have to put the mask on tight. The mask skirt rolls outward even with the mask pulled tight. The skirt rolls outward and tends to pinch. If you try and adjust the mask, the skirt will flip and role outward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask would have been much better if it was made from the gel.</li>
    <li> My husband just last night told me he loves this mask. We&#x27;ve had it for a few months and I didn&#x27;t know if he liked it or not but he said he likes the snugness.</li>
    <li> The mask works pretty well. Its is a very wide mask so be prepared with interference with your pillow if your a side sleeper. I bought the CPAP pillow in addition to this mask and that seems to do the trick. The mask is also very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Not a very good product. Lot of leaks.</li>
    <li> I bought this mask as a replacement for my original that was broken when it was accidentally steeped on. I&#x27;ve read the reviews and to me it&#x27;s obvious that people are simply just not buying the correct mask for their needs. When I picked up my CPAP and mask for the first time. I was able to pick and choose from a verity of different ones. I picked this one from several others because it didn&#x27;t make me feel claustrophobic like the others did. It took about a month for me to get use and learn how to properly adjust the straps. I admit it&#x27;s not the best design for sleeping on your side. A nasal mask or a CPAP pillow would probably be better for that. It does leak at times when the seal is broken. Most of the times from pressing down on the pillow but like I said a simple adjustment will take care of that. I&#x27;ve become very dependent on this mask for a good night sleep that I cant sleep without it.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Tried everything. Leaks constantly especially near eyes</li>
    <li> I bought this large size face mask to replace the medium sized mask that I received with my CPAP machine. Although the medium is the correct size for my face, I found that when my mouth dropped open in my sleep (almost all the time) my bottom lip rested on the bottom of the frame and caused air leakage. As a result of that, I wasn&#x27;t sleeping particularly well and the mask was less comfortable than I thought it should be. Since my medical provider wasn&#x27;t too much help, I decided to experiment and bought this large size mask from Amazon. It fit perfectly into my existing head gear, so I didn&#x27;t have to replace that. After getting used to the new size (a few days), I found myself sleeping for 5 or more hours without waking (compared with 2-3 hours with the medium size mask) because this one is long enough that my bottom lip stays well inside the frame even when my mouth is open. I did need to learn how to &amp;#34;seat&amp;#34; the top part of the mask around my nose, since that part is a little larger than I would like, but in the end I wish that it hadn&#x27;t taken me four months to try this, and that my medical provider had been more helpful. There must be quite a few people out there who sleep with their mouth open! I think that ResMed should develop a medium-long mask for people like me whose mouth falls open when they sleep.  That would be a perfect solution, but in the meantime, this one works for me.</li>
    <li> It is what it is.  Nothing wrong with the product, just predictably uncomfortable.  For mouth breathers, this is really the only viable option.</li>
    <li> As of yet the best mask to date that I have used and I have used over 4 different ones.  Very comfortable and seals well once you learn how to put it on properly.  The reason I gave a 4  instead of a 5 was the vent sometimes felt like it was blowing in eyes.</li>
