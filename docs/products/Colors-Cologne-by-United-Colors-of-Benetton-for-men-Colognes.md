      <li>Colors is Benetton&#x27;s first fragrance launched in 1987, very long time ago.</li>
      <li>The first note of lavender stays very long before it gives place for other note which I cannot identify very clearly.</li>

<li> The first note of lavender stays very long before it gives place for other note which I cannot identify very clearly.</li>
<li> My son has used colors cologne for as long as I can remember and he loves it.  </li>
<li> I wonder if i got the same product as the other who reviewed.</li>
<li> The scent stays with you for a very long time.</li>
<li> Just no real scent --</li>
<li> I have used this for a few years and though the cost has dropped a little all the rest looks the same.  </li>
<li> what I used to buy, it smells like your average cheapo aftershave.</li>
<li> Since you get used to the cologne&#x27;s smell and cannot tell, after a few minutes, I just go by verbal and non-verbal feedback from others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> .wonder if those good reviews are real or fake?! didnt like the smell.not too terrible</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but def.</li>
<li> Give it a try you won&#x27;t get disappointed.</li>
<li> Horrible!!!</li>
