      <li>And I guess I was saving the best for last!  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t find WEN to be the end-all be-all in hair care that many have found.</li>
      <li>Like the Almond Mint scent more.</li>
      <li>this and the pomegranate are my favorite.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite WEN.  </li>
      <li>Like to be able to get wen products without going through the telemarketing that ties you into an automatic delivery system.  </li>
      <li>I love the way that it smells and its silky, creamy texture.  </li>

      <li>Love WEN cleansers.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>The smell is FABULOUS!  </li>
      <li>Love this scent.</li>
      <li>Drugstore cleansing conditioners did not nourish my hair; after a while my hair&#x27;s condition deteriorated - this never happens with Wen which made my hair feel and look \\&quot;healthier\\&quot; and better with each use;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just just love it.</li>
      <li>So glad I now have this option.</li>
      <li>and I love this product</li>
      <li>the smell is so light and lovely</li>
      <li>I think it just gets a build up after a while, but that&#x27;s the easy fix.</li>
      <li>Works well for my fine hair.</li>
      <li>It keeps my fine hair from being flyaway.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Wen products.  </li>
      <li>Smells fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Even if it&#x27;s been a few days since i&#x27;ve used wen, awesome!!!!!</li>
      <li>been using Wen for several years and its kept my hair in great shape.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
      <li>This is my new favorite Wen cleansing conditioner!  </li>
      <li>It just smells clean.</li>
      <li>However because it is a gentler clean you have to wash your hair every day, even if you do not have oily hair.</li>
      <li>I normally use the sweet almond mint Wen but this has a beautiful fragrance and leaves my hair silky and soft.</li>
      <li>The drugstore brands&#x27; scents are very strong, comparing to Wen, which has a more \\&quot;elegant\\&quot; fragrance, and the Bamboo Green Tea has a very light, clean</li>
      <li>The Bamboo Green Tea Wen really does a great job!</li>
      <li>Delivery was quick.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to try this new Wen and didn&#x27;t think it could get any better</li>
      <li>Absolutely worth the price.</li>
      <li>My favorite Wen product by far.</li>
      <li>The bamboo version is especially emollient and rich and the scent is quite appealing.  </li>
      <li>The Bamboo Green Tea smells really nice too!</li>
      <li>If you clean up the oil build up after several weeks or months of use, your hair will look fabulous.  </li>
      <li>shampoo is exactly correct and sealed</li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel light and soft with out making it frizzy.</li>
      <li>, this is the first Wen that&#x27;s made with rice protein vs. wheat protein.</li>
      <li>I used this yesterday for the first time.  </li>
      <li>Love this shampoo and use it daily</li>
      <li>I have used other formulations of Wen - Bamboo - and it was amazing.  </li>
      <li>Not as good the Chaz Dean vanilla almond that we usually use.  </li>
      <li>I like the new fresh scent</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a miracle have the green tea scent and looking forward to trying the more sweet scents in the summer</li>
      <li>While the Herbal Essences and Pantene cleansing conditioners are significantly cheaper ($4.99) and they left my hair as nice and soft as Wen did initially (the first month or two) here are the significant differences between them and Wen and why I&#x27;m once again back with Wen:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
      <li>Previously, when my super dry, easily frizzy hair needed more moisture I&#x27;d use</li>
      <li>The Green Tea conditioner also smells amazing.  </li>
      <li>It has a very Unisex type smell that is just very.....</li>
      <li>Really like the product.</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair, which has particular needs.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m amazed at the difference in my hair; it&#x27;s full, thick, bouncy and so healthy.  </li>
      <li>I have used many of the other wen cleansing conditioner such as sweet almond mint, pomegranate, tea tree oil, cucumber melon,</li>
      <li>If you have a special date or something, wash your hair with a regular shampoo and then immediately rewash with WEN.  </li>
      <li>but this is hands down my favorite Wen cleanser/conditioner.</li>
      <li>Bamboo Green Tea and Fig are my favorite formulas (long/fine/dry/colored hair).</li>
      <li>The only reason I am not giving the seller 5 stars is that the Wen bottle arrived without a pump - fortunately,  I had an extra one.</li>
      <li>The Bamboo Green tea is the best for my thin hair.</li>
      <li>Which it can&#x27;t find very often, well worth the extra money when WEN is the only thing you use.</li>
      <li>I love WEN Bamboo Green Tea!</li>
      <li>I used BGT for my first cleanse and Wen Fig for my second cleanse.  </li>
      <li>My hair feels clean without feeling greasy, unlike other cleansing conditioners I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>TIP FOR NEW and old WEN USERS:  </li>
      <li>I use fewer pumps, about 5-7, leave in for awhile, comb thru then completely rinse.</li>
      <li>But I do really like the smell of it and find it works well as a leave-in conditioner after I wash and condition with my regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>WEN makes my hair soft and natural.</li>
      <li>WOW</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s one of the few that has the alcohol listed in the ingredients, way down the list, very important!</li>
      <li>Hair seems more silky &amp; less dry.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have to have my Wen. The Bamboo Green tea is the best for my thin hair. Love the smell too!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t find WEN to be the end-all be-all in hair care that many have found. But I do really like the smell of it and find it works well as a leave-in conditioner after I wash and condition with my regular shampoo and conditioner. It keeps my fine hair from being flyaway. I don&#x27;t care for it as a stand-alone shampoo, however.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this formula.  I have used other formulations of Wen - Bamboo - and it was amazing.  Loved it.  This?  On my very thick, curly, white girl long hair?  Awful.  Frizzy, lifeless, coarse.  I think the secret with Wen is buying the brand that matches your skin and hair type - this clearly was not mine.  Again, very very disappointed.</li>
    <li> where has this been all my life...WOW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have course hair and I love this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter what I did I could hardly get a comb through my hair after washing it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a miracle have the green tea scent and looking forward to trying the more sweet scents in the summer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also purchased the styling crème in the same sent...LOVE it</li>
    <li> Love the pump!  My entire family loves this shampoo / conditioner  combo.  Smells great too.</li>
    <li> I am WEN girl  WEN makes my hair soft and natural.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite Wen cleansing conditioner!  I love the way that it smells and its silky, creamy texture.  Just another great product from Wen.</li>
    <li> i have really long thick hair. this and the pomegranate are my favorite. been using Wen for several years and its kept my hair in great shape.</li>
    <li> I used this yesterday for the first time.  I used BGT for my first cleanse and Wen Fig for my second cleanse.  The Bamboo Green Tea cleansed my hair well, and left my curls firm and full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the scent is heavenly!</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find a good shampoo/conditioner for my hair.  I color my hair and also style it daily so needless to say it is pretty damaged.  Other shampoos and conditioners left my hair greasy or oily the day after I washed it.  It  is my first day using Wen and all I can say is I love it!!! my hair already feels healthier. The Green Tea conditioner also smells amazing.  I have no complaints I am officially a Wen girl.  By far the best cleansing conditioner I have tried I would recommend.  I can&#x27;t wait to try the other fragrances.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair, which has particular needs. I didn&#x27;t expect a hair product meant for all hair types to work for me, but I received some Wen as a gift and loved it. My hair feels clean without feeling greasy, unlike other cleansing conditioners I&#x27;ve tried. It sure is expensive, but a 32 oz bottle lasts me and my husband 6 months, offsetting the cost a bit. (My husband has stick-straight hair and it works for him too!) I knocked off one star because the two scents I&#x27;ve tried (pomegranate and bamboo green tea) are both cloyingly sweet, I&#x27;d prefer a subtler scent.</li>
    <li> Love WEN cleansers.  This one has a wonderful clean fragrance and consistent results.  I did have trouble with the pump but I think it was my error.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Wen user for a few year now, but looking to save some money, I took a break and used the new drugstore cleansing conditioners, such as Herbal Essences and Pantene. While the Herbal Essences and Pantene cleansing conditioners are significantly cheaper ($4.99) and they left my hair as nice and soft as Wen did initially (the first month or two) here are the significant differences between them and Wen and why I&#x27;m once again back with Wen:&lt;br /&gt;1) Drugstore cleansing conditioners did not nourish my hair; after a while my hair&#x27;s condition deteriorated - this never happens with Wen which made my hair feel and look \\&quot;healthier\\&quot; and better with each use;&lt;br /&gt;2) Drugstore cleansing conditioners do not make my haircolor last as Wen does;&lt;br /&gt;3) Drugstore cleansing conditioners made my hair feel \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; the next morning -- Wen is the only cleansing conditioner that leaves my hair feeling clean, even the next day.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the three major differences above (in my opinion) another thing to consider is fragrance. The drugstore brands&#x27; scents are very strong, comparing to Wen, which has a more \\&quot;elegant\\&quot; fragrance, and the Bamboo Green Tea has a very light, clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;The Bamboo Green Tea and Fig are my favorite formulas (long/fine/dry/colored hair). So while there may be decent alternatives on the market -- THERE IS ONLY ONE WEN. Amazon has the best prices too, and free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***BTW, this is the first Wen that&#x27;s made with rice protein vs. wheat protein. If you&#x27;re allergic to wheat, you may want to try this. I found that my hair responds best to this formula, it seems \\&quot;lighter\\&quot; than the others. I use the Fig in the dry winter months.</li>
    <li> Like the Almond Mint scent more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen for the past year and I&#x27;m amazed at the difference in my hair; it&#x27;s full, thick, bouncy and so healthy.  I wanted to try this new Wen and didn&#x27;t think it could get any better but this is hands down my favorite Wen cleanser/conditioner. My hair, at age 60+, is like that I had when I was in my 20&#x27;s. The bamboo version is especially emollient and rich and the scent is quite appealing.  This one is a winner!</li>
    <li> I bought this product through Amazon and it was delivered a day earlier than originally expected. That was a plus. I have used many of the other wen cleansing conditioner such as sweet almond mint, pomegranate, tea tree oil, cucumber melon, six thirteen......this bamboo green  tea is by far THE best wen I have ever used!! In just 3 washings my hair.was more whiney, more.bouncey, and much more managable. I will continue to keep using this wen because I LOVE the way it improved my hair!!!</li>
    <li> Really smoothing compared to other Wen formulations I normally buy (Pom, Gardenia, Vanilla Mint &amp; previously 4 of 5 originals).  Hair seems more silky &amp; less dry.  Have used this approx. 4 washes now &amp; could tell difference on 1st wash.  Like smell.  Fyi: Am bothered by gluten &amp; have no problems with this &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34;.  Previously, when my super dry, easily frizzy hair needed more moisture I&#x27;d use When&#x27;s 613 Lemon Rosemary Vanilla Bean (doesn&#x27;t smell as good as sounds) to wash &amp; leave in - really makes a difference, but has been hard to find &amp; expensive. So glad I now have this option.</li>
    <li> Love this scent. Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I use fewer pumps, about 5-7, leave in for awhile, comb thru then completely rinse. Works well for my fine hair. i really like the green tea</li>
    <li> best hair cleanser ever.  the smell is so light and lovely</li>
    <li> My fav wen product yet!!</li>
    <li> Delivery was quick.  The only reason I am not giving the seller 5 stars is that the Wen bottle arrived without a pump - fortunately,  I had an extra one.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  However because it is a gentler clean you have to wash your hair every day, even if you do not have oily hair.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t try other alternative products.  I did.  None came close to Wen.  Wife and I have been using Wen for two years.  Sweat by it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product.  I normally use the sweet almond mint Wen but this has a beautiful fragrance and leaves my hair silky and soft.</li>
    <li> My favorite Wen product by far. The scent is very faint. It just smells clean. Leaves my hair texture a lot softer than the Cranberry and Mint scent.</li>
    <li> I love WEN Bamboo Green Tea! Makes my hair feel light and soft with out making it frizzy. That and its 32oz! Which it can&#x27;t find very often, well worth the extra money when WEN is the only thing you use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Wen products.  The Bamboo Green Tea smells really nice too!</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic.  Just just love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Make my hair shiny and it has a wonderful smell!</li>
    <li> Like to be able to get wen products without going through the telemarketing that ties you into an automatic delivery system.  Just don&#x27;t like to do that.  Like the Green tea-works well with my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this one the best!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite WEN.  Great condition and fragrance.</li>
    <li> Im been using wen for years nothing come close.I&#x27;m probably keep using it till something else better than wen.</li>
    <li> Just bougt a gallon size on QVC for when this runs out.  GREAT product! Love the Wen deals you can get on Amazon!!!!</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Tea Tree and I find the Bamboo to be very similar. The Bamboo washes out quickly and easily with a wonderful light scent. I have now have two favorites.</li>
    <li> My sister gave me a bottle of WEN for Christmas this past year (thats all she uses) and once I used it I knew I would never use another hair product again!!</li>
    <li> Really like the product. Would highly recommend it, especially if you color your hair. Love this shampoo and use it daily</li>
    <li> Always the best stuff</li>
    <li> shampoo is exactly correct and sealed</li>
    <li> The Bamboo Green Tea Wen really does a great job!</li>
    <li> Not as good the Chaz Dean vanilla almond that we usually use.  Seems to leave the hair too heavy.</li>
    <li> I hate to even rate this at 5 stars, because Amazon will either run out of them, or the price will go crazy high because people are buying it; but, nevertheless, it&#x27;s the best WEN cleansing conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  I was committed to trying them all, and I think this is the last one I&#x27;ve found that I hadn&#x27;t tried.  And I guess I was saving the best for last!  The smell is FABULOUS!  It&#x27;s clean, with none of that tingly menthol nonsense that almost every scent has (I hate that stuff! Who needs a tingly head, back, and butt crack?)  It has a very Unisex type smell that is just very.....well, Green.  My hair has responded very nicely to it.  I have medium to thick, slightly oily, long, white girl hair.  I&#x27;m going to go ahead and order another bottle for fear that it will disappear forever.  TIP FOR NEW and old WEN USERS:  If you have a special date or something, wash your hair with a regular shampoo and then immediately rewash with WEN.  If you clean up the oil build up after several weeks or months of use, your hair will look fabulous.  I think it just gets a build up after a while, but that&#x27;s the easy fix.</li>
    <li> Great product for hair.</li>
    <li> Absolutely worth the price. I like the new fresh scent and it&#x27;s one of the few that has the alcohol listed in the ingredients, way down the list, very important! I have been out mowing the lawn for hours with my garden hat on, taken it off, wow my hair, smells great!!! Even if it&#x27;s been a few days since i&#x27;ve used wen, awesome!!!!!</li>
    <li> gives my hair the bounce it needs without feeling weighed down.</li>
