<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this stuff! Love the smell! Love the feel of it on my face! Plan on ordering more ASAP!</li>
    <li> This is my second jar.  I normally use more brand name cosmetics.  But I find this to work at least as well, if not better, and at much lower price.  Save the $ for something else!  I&#x27;m in my late 50&#x27;s and have generally good skin.  It also goes on very easily and feels good, especially the current version.  Hope its equally effective.    However, I just saw a review by someone else that this product contains a preservative Sodium Benzoate.  I validated this info at the Avalon Organics website.  I also independantly validated that this, combined with Vit C does create Benzene, a known carcinogen.  However, this is tested in ingested form.  Also, I think we have to take things in perspective, its a matter of amount. Further this same preservative is used in many jams as a preservative and is restricted by FDA.  This is the text I found on wikepedia when researching \\&quot;Sodium Benzoate plus Vit. C\\&quot;.      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_benzoate    It is most widely used in acidic foods such as salad dressings (vinegar), carbonated drinks (carbonic acid), jams and fruit juices (citric acid), pickles (vinegar), and condiments. It is also used as a preservative in medicines and cosmetics.[3][4] Concentration as a preservative is limited by the FDA in the U.S. to 0.1% by weight.[5] Sodium benzoate is also allowed as an animal food additive at up to 0.1%, according to AFCO&#x27;s official publication.[6]    In food, the amount is controlled by FDA.  I do not know if its controlled in cosmetics.  But as its even used/ allowed in acidic foods, I have no concerns using it as an external application on my face so I will continue to use it unless I find more info otherwise.</li>
    <li> Product seems to be ok.  Takes time to see if results are as predicted.</li>
    <li> Like it. Have reordered. Which I rarely find skin care stuff that I like that much.</li>
    <li> My favorite Vitamin C Cream!</li>
    <li> Improving daily!great stuff!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my face breakout like other lotions.  Little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I like to use it before sleep.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to determine usefulness.</li>
    <li> I love this for moisturizing my face. I&#x27;m 68 and I&#x27;ve used more expensive products but go back to (this one) every time. I got tired of fooling around with the latest and greatest moisturizer product being advertised, so now I just use this one. I like more natural things to put on and in my body. If I didn&#x27;t like it, I have the others I could use, but this one does the job for me.</li>
    <li> Beware contains vitamin E (tocopheryl)!  For those of us that are highly allergic to vitamin E (tocopheryl), the description of this product on Amazon is misleading.  I went out to the Avalon site and discovered that the extended ingredients list does in fact contain tocopheryl acetate.  I cannot tell you how many times I have purchased an item from an online retailer and discovered that it contained vitamin E/tocopheryl.  My skin swells, becomes extremely red and erupts in skin lesions akin to boils.  In some instances, my skin has actually erupted and started to bleed.  Manufacturers have latched on to this ingredient are including it in items such as kleenex, personal wipes, sun screens and a myriad of lotions.  If you find yourself experiencing any of these symptoms, please check the ingredients of the product for vitamin E/tocopheryl/tocopherol.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this product - the smell is fabulous and I love other products the company makes, especially the lavender-scented cleansing wash and daily SPF moisturizer. But for the first time in my life a face product gave me a rash...an itchy, red rash mostly around my hairline and eyebrows. I do not have sensitive skin and have always been able to use any product. Why this? Other comments focus on vitamin E...not sure that&#x27;s it for me. I will be calling the company to complain. I want my money back!</li>
    <li> Really nice cream.  This was the second time I bought it.</li>
    <li> The only make up I wear is moisturizers. This keeps my skin flexible yet toned.</li>
    <li> My favorite facial cream. Light, not greasy. Pleasant very mild scent. Works well. I don&#x27;t know what the people who complain about &amp;#34;chalkiness&amp;#34; are talking about. I have the new formula and it seems just like the old one to me. I&#x27;ve tried many facial creams and always come back to this one.</li>
    <li> Love love love it. My wife says my skin is like a baby&#x27;s bottom...</li>
    <li> I decided to try this because i need some \\&quot;glow\\&quot; on my skin. I&#x27;ve used it for two months (at first i used it morning &amp; night for three weeks, but then i only used it at night.) and I&#x27;m almost out. Pretty expensive if you ask me. I don&#x27;t know, but my skin feels dull as usual. Even though the cream is thick, i didn&#x27;t feel really moisturized. It just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I have Avalon organics face wash and body wash and I love both of them so I thought I would give this a try as well. The moisturizer has vitamin C infused in it so it&#x27;s great for anti aging, and it&#x27;s organic so it&#x27;s an all around healthy moisturizer for your skin. I&#x27;m a freak about healthy skincare because what you put on your body is just as important as what you put in it. The only downside is that if you use too much it does tend to get a little oily, so just remember a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s a great product just don&#x27;t over do the moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Vitamin C renewal cream. I am on my second bottle now and i swear by it. It leaves my skin feeling \\&quot;renewed\\&quot; as it says it should. My skin just drinks it up- its a bit thick, but i dont seem to have a problem with it- it goes on smooth and wears well under makeup.     I have noticed a dramatic change in my skin tone since i stared using this product. Dark spots are beginning to diminish, and my overall skin tone has gotten better. I would recommend this to anyone that has normal to dry skin. Its perfect and refreshing.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer - it&#x27;s light, not greasy and does a wonderful job of keeping my face moisturized. It&#x27;s smell terrific too.</li>
    <li> Not like it use to be. This stuff started breaking me out.</li>
    <li> I had been using this product for years with great results. My skin looked great and people would ask me often what I used for facial cream. Well, a couple of months ago I bought more product when I was out, only to find that the formula is different. My skin was burning and red and my neck was so itchy for days that I had to stop using it. It&#x27;s really too bad that they had to change this product because I once loved it and now can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> VERY strong orange smell.  I don&#x27;t know about anyone else, but I prefer NOT to smell like an orange.  I always buy unscented items so they don&#x27;t clash with my perfume.  May be a great cream, but....  I am hoping the smell fades....and fast!  Makes me wonder if I&#x27;ll attract flies when/if I go out with this cream on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says it can be used under makeup.  Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d wear this cream out of doors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  The smell DOES fade after about 5 minutes, though my dog can still smell it.  Not sure if I just got used to it or if it faded completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice if they could, somehow, remove the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  The cream does seem to do a good job of moisturizing.</li>
    <li> My skin is damaged from being blemished-prone and sensitive. It is healing up all the spots that I have from old acne and doesn&#x27;t seem to be making me break out. Just don&#x27;t put on too much in the morning if you plan on wearing a tinted moisturizer or foundation, or you may be a bit shiney. I put it on thicker at night to allow my skin to soak up all the healing benefits of this cream.</li>
    <li> I like this daytime cream, it moisturizes without being too greasy. I also found it nonirrittating to my sensitive skin, as some vitamin C products can be.  It sometimes needs to be applied more than once during the dry winter weather.</li>
    <li> I love the citrusy smell. It&#x27;s very thick and rich, and makes my face feel smooth and firm. The only downside is the price! 13 bucks, and this jar is bloody small! I mean ya it doesn&#x27;t take much....but still. I&#x27;m not going to complain too much because my local organic store carries this cream and they charge 23.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time for anything on my skin, it stops itch, clears up cold sores, renews and is just plain amazing.</li>
    <li> I heard at a dr oz show and had this age spot in my arm.  The spot is now almost not visible and some other scars are less visible i will be re odering soon i am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for over 5 years now.  I don&#x27;t understand some of the negative reviews.  I have acne prone skin and this lotion has been great on my skin.  It&#x27;s not too oily at all.  I apply some jajoba oil around my eyes and apply this lotion over it all over my face.  I bought this lotion 5-6 years ago after I watched a TV program hosted by a dermatologist, who advised people to use lotions that have vitamin C in them and how great it is for skin.  It&#x27;s been wonderful so far.  I noticed someone leaving a negative review saying don&#x27;t get this in your eyes or it will burn! are you kidding me?? Everyone knows you are not supposed to put lotion in your eyes and if so, it could burn!!  I highly recommend this lotion.  I buy on Amazon, because it&#x27;s cheaper than Target!</li>
    <li> burns. did not notice any difference in skin.</li>
    <li> This is  a really nice product.  It is very soothing to the face and has a very pleasant smell.  I will continue to purchase this product as needed.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and speed of shipment.</li>
    <li> I real feel the difference in my skin, after two weeks using this cream my face feels ticker and fresh.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. It smells terrific and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a night time cream because i just love the Vitamin C Serum. Its great on my skin. A little goes a long way. I have sensitive, acne scarred skin that&#x27;s oily with dry patches. This cream is amazing.</li>
    <li> The best lotion. Super gentle. Smells delight and fruity. Don&#x27;t put too much on the face though. Less is more. I usually wake up in the morning with the oiliest skin you can possibly imagine, but with little bit of this product, the amount of oil on my skin is cut down in half. This is my second bottle. I will use this forever.</li>
    <li> After much chemo and radiation my face looked dry and drawn.  I started using this and saw a difference right away.  Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> My estheticIan recommended  this product and I love it!</li>
    <li> This is exactly the product I was looking for, the ingredients are organic, and the reviews were great, so I bought a jar. I was not disappointed. From the first application of this rich and orange-scented cream, I was hooked. The cream is absorbed by the skin and feels wonderful. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to be able to see a change in my skin, but I know it will work wonders. It just feels full of healing power. I love this cream! I immediately bought two more jars to give as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint was these two gift jars were shipped from someplace hot and the cream melted a bit inside the container, but never separated. Maybe products like this could be shipped at night when the temperatures are lower.</li>
    <li> Good but not my favorite........It&#x27;s organic and has vitamin C which is why I bought it but no big or anything special will not buy again. I like Complex 15 cheaper and better ...just not for me!~</li>
    <li> For the first time in my life, I&#x27;ve used a moisturizer.  I have always been hesitant to use moisturizers because my skin is oily and prone to break outs. Though I&#x27;ve just used this product for a few days, I am happy to report no break outs! My skin feels soft and looks brighter already. As an added bonus, I love the orange / citrus scent. Very fresh.</li>
    <li> Great smell!  Feels good on the skin.  to soon for visible results.</li>
    <li> I like it&#x27;s effect on my skin. It seems firmer, brighter and more youthful in appearance. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Dr.s say use Vit C and this cream is great...can&#x27;t go wrong if you order this and it&#x27;s even more reasonable than purchasing at Wal-Mart.</li>
    <li> It does not smell like an original vitamin c cream. I have used better vitamin c cream from the body shop but I thought of switching to something else this time. I took a little bit of this cream and applied it all over my face and guess what my face looked so oily and shiny plus my skin broke out from my cheeks. I don&#x27;t know about others but this cream is very heavy for my skin. I would recommend this cream for dry skin but a big no no for oily or sensitive skin like me.</li>
    <li> This is a moisturizing product with an Overwhelming orange scent. When I tried it on my face, my eyes watered For 20 minutes. Will use it on my feet and will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to tell but other than that my mom seems to like it so its fairly good</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for quite a while now. I really like it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is seriously amazing. After using it for a few days I saw a real change in my skin, especially in terms of brightness.</li>
    <li> Nice light citrus scent.  Love the texture. Moisturizes without being heavy. I love it.  Had my sister try it and she loves the feel of it as well. Have only been using about a week so can not speak to any noticeable changes to my skin. But it feels good to wear a moisturizer that&#x27;s does what it supposed to.... Moisturizes! !</li>
    <li> New formula is lighter in weight and goes on more smoothly.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C cream is the bomb. It really works on my 3rd jar already. You can feel it working on you skin especially the forehead.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I&#x27;ve tried other much more expensive Vitamin C moisturizers and this product stands up to them for about half the price.  A great buy.</li>
    <li> I love this creme! I noticed a difference in wrinkle reduction after first use!</li>
    <li> I used to use this product all the time BUT they have changed the formula and now it is thick and it stinks. They took something nice and ruined it. The smell is horrible and I&#x27;m not the type to use something just because I don&#x27;t care for the smell. I just don&#x27;t trust this product anymore. It is hard to smooth onto my face and the smell is weird and nasty. This is the new &amp; improved version I am referring to because it has the new packaging. I use less &amp; less Avalon Organic products because I just don&#x27;t trust them anymore. I also used to love their lemon hand &amp; body lotion &amp; now the new and improved version stinks.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BOUGHT THIS ITEM OVER AND OVER AGAIN I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Vitamin C is good for the skin, keeps it young.  I use on arms too, when skin gets too dry</li>
    <li> I have long been a fan of the entire Avalon Organics line, but especially the Vitamin C products, and this cream is no exception. It&#x27;s smooth, nourishing, rich and smells divine. I love the idea of a cruelty free product that gives better results than high priced products do. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This product used to be great- as was their lemon shampoo and grapefruit shower gel.  Formulas for all 3 were changed.  I complained and was told that they had to change the formula in order to call it organic.  I don&#x27;t know if the requirements changed or they weren&#x27;t compliant in the first place, but none of these 3 products are good anymore.  This used to be thick- now is extremely runny.</li>
    <li> This cream has brightened my complexion.  Recommend using it in conjunction with mild exfoliation.  Like the antioxidant benefit as well.</li>
    <li> Wish I had pirchased this one again instead of the one with sunscree added.</li>
    <li> This cream is is so smooth, and creamy.&lt;br /&gt;I especially like to use it on my neck and chest area. Makes it look very smooth and almost blurred.</li>
    <li> This cream is quite expensive in the stores. It was affordable so thatI was able to order enough for me and friends who love it. The fragrance is a lovely citrus and it really lasts a long time.  I like the way it makes my skin look and feel. Found out about it through a friend.</li>
    <li> quite good after a month using!</li>
    <li> I like the consistency... .the smell....the results seem good . No irritation . I mix with argon oil . Its great .</li>
    <li> If vitamin C breaks down rapidly, after two weeks, then how can we be sure that this product is effective?</li>
    <li> Totally different from the rest of the creams! All natural, and recommended by 2 amazing plastic surgeons in Dr. Oz show</li>
    <li> I use for tiny areas of the face that get harsh OTC products &amp; scrapes in armpits. Need frequent applications but useful for someone w/Eczema or SFPN based issues.</li>
    <li> i love the citrusy delicate smell of the product.  my face has never felt softer.  goes on smoothly. seems to absorb well.  i&#x27;m almost 61 and proud of it.  i&#x27;ve surprised even new doctors who thought i was in my mid to late 30&#x27;s.  i&#x27;m hoping this helps maintain my lucky genetics!  i plan on routinely re-ordering this product!  thank you.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, I alternate it with my other products and it feels silky. Glad they use SPF I am finding some of the higher end products I use don&#x27;t have SPF so this will take the place of those during the summer months for sure.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells incredible! It&#x27;s rather thick which I don&#x27;t like. But it hasn&#x27;t caused any break outs. I just wasn&#x27;t that impressed so now just use it if I get minor sunburns or skin irritations. It is very soothing.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent moisturizer. I like it and would rate it much higher but, I had the feeling that someone may have used this product because the jar didn&#x27;t seem quite full.&lt;br /&gt; I have used the product before, having purchased at a naturals foods market, never online b</li>
    <li> I like this product. Second time I have purchased it.</li>
    <li> Loved this moisturizer!smells like fresh oranges!!</li>
    <li> Definitely have seen improvements in my skin since i started using this product. My face was looking tired and dry with dark circles no matter how much i rested, this product was like a burst of freshness my skin now glows and is vibrant. Give it a try hopefully it works for you like it worked for me.</li>
    <li> I use this along with the serum, cleanser, and toner every night.  It keeps my skin bright, even, hydrated and clear.  My skin looks amazing.  It helped clear some discoloration.  I have dry sensitive skin and am 37.  I am very happy with this cream.  I will buy again...last a long time.  Completely absorbs and hydrates.  Smells amazing.</li>
    <li> It smells just like a freshly cut orange, is light and feels great. I can&#x27;t say its made any difference in the look of my skin, but is a great moisturizer and very soothing.</li>
    <li> was recommended to get this for my skin.  the dermatologist brand was too pricy - this is reasonable and seems to do the trick.</li>
    <li> This my second jar. It works well, not irritating the skin and it does whitens! It also has a pleasant orange scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a night cream and I love it.  It makes my skin so soft and smooth and it smells like oranges and sunshine.  Applying it instantly puts me in a happy mood.</li>
    <li> I love this Vitamin C Renewal Facial Cream! It can be used as a day cream or night cream, so I tried this morning first time, it smells gentle orange smell and my skin is so different, so soft and alive. I do like it. Texture of the cream is thick and especially good for cold winter season I think. I give this product 5 stars. Its funny that I am switching to buy more and more things through amazon and not in a real shops. There are certain things you can get online better deal or better quality product, so this cream is a really good choice.</li>
    <li> This product feels great going on, but the feeling is short-lived.  It only seems to moisturize for a couple of hours.</li>
    <li> This ddnt work for me. Used morning and night as a moisturizer but no change. Glad it made a difference to some. Not on me.</li>
    <li> skin lotion, very good but should give a try to the sunscreen one!</li>
    <li> I wrote this for the vitamin C serum and  wanted to add this to this product...Hi, I would like to recommend this product without any reservation.  I am a 50 year old man, whose outdoors type lifestyle put my skin through alot....20 years military, motorcycle riding, lots of beach.  When I began going back to school for digital media, I was in front of the camera alot, and just mentioned that fact to my sister, who sent me toward this product.  I had always used moisturizer and thought that is all anyone can do, but within a week, yes a week, I could see my skin on my face change.  Laugh lines less apparent, neck skin supple and tighter.  So there you have it, it really does work, even on a guy like me!  I am going to cut and paste this on the Avalon Organics Vitamin C renewal since I use that at night and it is the combination of the two that gave me these results</li>
    <li> Used this before, so, I was familiar with this face cream. I use this under a heavier cream during the day.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, but I can&#x27;t say it did anything special for my face.  I had read about all the positive effects vitamin C is supposed to have on your skin, but I can&#x27;t see any difference after using this for over a month.  I don&#x27;t understand the reviews that said it was a good moisturizer either--didn&#x27;t do a thing for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and light on the skin and the odor is pleasant. Will purchase more when needed.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for carrying this brand.</li>
    <li> I love this! Real Vitamin C that really helps your Skin improve and is anti-aging.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing and invigorating!</li>
    <li> Use this every day. When you first apply the lotion feels thick but it quickly dissolves into your skin and feels so healthy.  I do see and feel a difference in my face as it&#x27;s smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the fast shipment. The product is not as good as it was said by other reviewers. From my experience, Jason Vitamin E Cream produces better result than this one.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the product because of the strong orange fragrance that irritates my eyes.  However, I really dislike ANY orange odor so am probably not a good judge.  Although I did stick with it for a few days and like the results and feel on my skin.  My husband uses it now!  He has really dry patches and says this is working well for him.</li>
    <li> the product seems good, but the problem is it feels oily and make my face look shiny if wearing alone.</li>
    <li> love this cream ... definitely will be reordering</li>
    <li> Great Product...Price/Value is outstanding..This product has a very good yield...a little goes a long way..and it works instantly..on the face and neck..Actually froze in the trunk of my car...and was able use..and worked perfectly..upon thawing...no drop off in quality or performance..so its durable as well....Would look for an eye cream in this brand....a definite hit</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t kn about this product yet i am still using..not even half way through the jar yetso i will let you all kn if it works..</li>
    <li> So far is good , still is not time to write a review&lt;br /&gt;I will do it later when I finish the facial cream</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed was looking for a facial system but this is not for me – better luck with something else</li>
    <li> I bought this to try after watching Dr. Oz.  The dermatologists said to use vitamin C. I like it so far but have only used about a week.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  IT soaks right in and really makes a difference in my skin.  I will definitely keep using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks.  It  is a great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> My 62 year old weathered neck loved it and my face has also responded well.  I will continue to buy it</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something to magically make you look like you are twenty, let me know when you find it. If you want a nice face cream that is made from some natural (ish) ingredients and has a pleasant orangy smell instead of a perfumy smell, this is a good option. I&#x27;m not going to say it reduced lines and wrinkles, but for the money it&#x27;s a nice alternative to those lotions that smell like perfume. And, it&#x27;s way less expensive than buying something from the cosmetics counter in Dillards. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now, and I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this cream with the wonderful orange scent.  I did not buy directly from Avalon, but from an Amazon merchant.  There is no expiration (or best used by) date on either the jar or the box.  Based on others&#x27; comments about the wonderful scent that is so faint in mine, I wonder if the jar I received from a reseller was past its prime. That aside, I have had to stop using the cream on my face.  It is so heavy that I believe it is blocking my pores.  I still plan to use it on my hands and feet, and am interested in trying either the moisturizing lotion or serum.  If you don&#x27;t do well with heavy creams, you might want to try a different Vitamin C product.</li>
    <li> I first bought this product at a health food store, then at a major chain &amp; now I order it through Amazon as it&#x27;s much cheaper. I love this product &amp; now have my 87yr. old mother using it. I&#x27;m recommending it to many of my friends as they&#x27;ve noticed how nice my complexion is. And the bonus is the light &amp;#34;orangish&amp;#34; aroma...it&#x27;s a relaxing smell.</li>
    <li> I guess I am used to using a different band for my face,I really did not see any difference using Avalon Organics.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this cream for about 2 weeks.  Already I can feel a difference in the smoothness of my skin.  We live in the high desert of California where there is very little, if any at all, humidity in the air.  My skin was beginning to get a very rough, bumpy feel to it.  I&#x27;ve tried many different products, from Clinique to Lancôme, with results that did not warrant the cost of the product.  I read about Vitamin C cream and the ratings on this one were very high.  It&#x27;s a good cream.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This cream smells great, feels amazing and I love it! Having only used it a short time, I cannot spak of amazing results yet, but my face feels softer and feels like it is working to restore moisture to my skin.</li>
    <li> The scent is orange citrusy....live the way it feels on my face.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff but it is way too expensive compared to other products i have seen</li>
    <li> Excellent product....I placed another order for it...thanks.</li>
    <li> I just started using this!  It is a soft smell!  I love it!  It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, but it goes on very smooth and feels not watery!  Even my sister who is very sensitive to smells (everything gives her headaches) likes this!</li>
    <li> This cream is thick, has a lovely orange scent and really soaks in fast. No waiting to put on makeup.  I can actually feel it tightening my skin a bit, and that&#x27;s a good thing at my age!</li>
    <li> This stuff is good moisturizer and it has a refreshing orange citress smell.  Can&#x27;t go wrong.  Price reasonable. Jar could be a little bigger though.</li>
    <li> The only face cream that does not make my face oily and also doesn&#x27;t make me break out. My local drug stores no longer supply it and I now order it from amazon because there&#x27;s just no substitute. If you have acne prone skin skin that dries out very easily, this is a great product. Also, it&#x27;s great for summer when your skin is dry from too much sun whether it&#x27;s tan or sunburn. It helps repair your skin and even your tan without being overly drying or break out causing like aloe Vera.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I have ever used. I received this as a stocking stuffer this year and will continue to use from now on. I use this night and day. It makes my skin feel super smooth and refreshed. It also absorbs right away so there is no oily residue (like you sometimes get with other moisturizers).&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with this moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I think I need to try it with E</li>
    <li> I am still using the cream and have not had any positive compliments as yet but I see great changes</li>
    <li> nasinthing made for me</li>
    <li> Smells nice and keeps my skin smooth. Doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and is easy to apply. I don&#x27;t notice much difference in my skin. But everybody is different</li>
    <li> Not the best value here for this little 2 oz. bottle, but other than that I like this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is good and even after being in my truck during extremely hot days (Arizona), the cream held in place. In the past I have experienced creams that escape the bottle and make a mess, but their lid structure is flawless and holds it all in there. To top it off, they even have a interior plastic lid under the outer lid for insurance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my arms, face, neck, and ears after being in the sun for long periods of time and it gets the job done as far as preventing sun burn from creeping in and knocking out the dangerous stuff from UV exposure. Vitamin C is an anti-cancer agent, so I&#x27;m hoping that by putting on this stuff after big sun exposure days will help me avoid getting skin cancer. Will keep yah posted on how that goes over the next 40 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the bad smell those other guys are talking about, I don&#x27;t have that. It simply smells like an orange that has been highly processed and is now being smeared on my skin. No biggie.</li>
    <li> Excellent cream!! I use it day &amp; night. Not greasy at all. Goes on so smooth&amp; you can smell the scent of oranges, which I love!! Makes you&#x27;re face look healthy &amp; smooth. I just used up my last jar. It&#x27;s time to buy more.</li>
    <li> They have changed the formula and now it stings and turns your face red. It also now has a fake, nauseating chemically orangy smell. I can&#x27;t believe they ruined such a perfect product. I recommend eucerin q10 anti-wrinkle sensitive skin creme is GREAT and has vitamin C too and is unscented! NO fake orangy/ chemically orangy smell as the newer avalon has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to LOVE this cream it was PERFECT then they changed it to \\&quot;get the NSF rating\\&quot; and it&#x27;s now terrible it BURNS my face TURNS IT BRIGHT RED and burns SO BAD. Now it has sodium benzoate in it. It&#x27;s so stupid to add sodium benzoate to a product with Vitamin C in the name. Sodium benzoate PLUS ascorbic acid (vitamin C) forms benzene, a known carcinogen. It doesn&#x27;t spread well or even absorb at all anymore it leaves your face clown white right before it turns bright red, Im not sure how this has a NFS rating when it seems to have much more chemicals now, it smells less like oranges and more like chemicals and it burns your skin. I can&#x27;t understand why a company would take a perfect cream, that worked so well and totally 100% ruin it. I makes me mad. Why can&#x27;t they leave well enough alone. Not only will I not buy this cream again, I&#x27;m sworn off of avalon organics 100% until they bring the old formula back. It took me YEARS of trying creams to find one I really loved and stuck with and now I have to start all over again. I don&#x27;t take this lightly.</li>
    <li> I love Avalon Organics, if you use this in combination with Oz Naturals Hyaluronic Acid serum  , you will not regret buying both. Oz is also a cruelty free Vegan product.</li>
    <li> I love this face cream. I am 50 years old and was told at a salon I needed to use a cream with vitamin C for evening out my complexion and diminishing fine lines. Theirs was on sale for $100 for 1 ounce! Plus it was full of chemicals. I trust Avalon Organics to be all natural. This cream feels really nice on my skin, makes it look good, and the smell is terrific- like fresh oranges. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I like the results I have gotten with this product. It is moisturizing and has a nice orange fragrance. It makes my skin feel firmer.</li>
    <li> I smell like orange juice and it is a little sticky just like you put orange juice on your face</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second container of this product. It seems to moisturize fairly well, but doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long which is why I removed a star. I like the ingredient list and the price is right.</li>
    <li> Its ok but for me it wasn&#x27;t anything special.. Wouldnt buy again.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to this product.  It burned my skin and turned it bright red.  What specific ingredient/s am I allergic to?  Who knows?! The product ingredients are NOT listed on the label.    It appears \\&quot;Avalon Organics\\&quot; engages in deceptive marketing.  The product name implies an organic product, but no disclosure of product ingredients is given.  Furthermore, the product small print only reveals the product contains \\&quot;70% organic content\\&quot;.  This means 30% is inorganic, chemical content.  For this reason the product is NOT organic.    Consumers seeking truth in advertising, disclosure of ingredients, and safe, organic products should avoid Avalon Organic.</li>
    <li> Using it at night works the best. Love it</li>
    <li> I will continue to order this product.  I was actually surprised at how much I like this facial cream.  I use it in the morning before putting on my makeup and at night before bed. The orange fragrance is wonderful.</li>
    <li> My very favorite lotion for my face/neck!!!! Amazing:)</li>
    <li> Love the moisturizing smoothness of this cream. It is silky and rich and leaves your skin soft and dewy. The price is a bit high but I will buy it again because I really like the product. AND it smells DELICIOUS!</li>
    <li> This is great! Absorbs. Not greasy. Smells great.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loves it, cheaper than local store great product happy girlfriend</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this because it seemed to be a healthier alternative to my clinique cream that I have been using. I applied the cream and it immediately started to burn my face! Then my face turned red! I washed it off and it continued to sting for the next half an hour or so... Not happy at all.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I&#x27;ve been using it as a night moisturizer. Although it could be used during the day also. It&#x27;s not at all greasy and smells really good- like oranges!</li>
    <li> its ok but I am still trying it.  I see a little different but not much. I been using for two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I will let you know in about 2 more weeks.</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing and really wakes you up in the morning. You only need a tiny bit to cover your whole face. It has the consistency of greek yogurt, and I like that. I dislike runny moisturizers. That means they have extra water in them, so you get less. But you get a good amount in this stuff. I use it once a day and it takes me about 6 months to run out. It makes your skin feel extra smooth (I have super dry skin), and it doesn&#x27;t make you break out (I also have sensitive skin). The best way to use it is right after you wash your face. Don&#x27;t dry your face completely. Leave a little bit of moisture on your face, then apply this while your skin is still warm and damp. You will feel like you just got a spa facial.</li>
    <li> I lovwe this line...I had a redness on my neck...after a week, it was gone...I knew then I had chosen the GREATEST LINE...</li>
    <li> Love the Avalon products have alway had good luck with them.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and i didn&#x27;t find this to be moisturizing enough for me. I&#x27;m in search of another night cream. Although it does smell great.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a good face cream, use it around my eyes, I used all over my face but it made my cheeks kind of pink, but all in all it&#x27;s a good cream, I used it before bed.............</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this product.  It has a waxy consistency, however, applies easily.  I like the feeling of it as it seems to stay with my skin rather than just sink in to nothing.  I have noticed an improvement in my skin.  It is smoother, brighter and brown spots are diminished.  Also, I have used the product for only a couple of weeks so to see improvement is impressive.  It is also priced right.</li>
    <li> I just love the smell of this stuff and also it feels so soothing when I put it on my face. very nice product</li>
    <li> -Edit review Dec 22 2015&lt;br /&gt;I read the replies to my review(thank you, buy the way, for all the postings)  and found that Avalon indeed changed the ingredients. They took out Sodium Benzoate. Yay!&lt;br /&gt;Yet, they stragely kept Benzoate in the oil free version and serum and the other products. A curious thing.&lt;br /&gt; Anyway, keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is  the new ingredients list:&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice(1), Aqua (Water), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil(1), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Myristyl Myristate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter(1), Borago Officinalis Seed Oil(1), Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Seed Oil(1), Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil(1), Rosa Canina Fruit Oil(1), Arnica Montana Flower Extract(1), Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract(1), Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract (White Tea)(1), Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract(1), Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Extract (Lemon Bioflavonoids), Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract(1), Olea Europaea (Olive) Leaf Extract(1), Saccharomyces/Xylinum/Black Tea Ferment(1), Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Ascorbic Acid, Polyglyceryl-6 Distearate, Squalane, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Alcohol(1), Glyceryl Caprylate, Citral, Limonene, Linalool. (1)Certified Organic Ingredient.-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous review:&lt;br /&gt;I quite liked the consistency and moisturizing effect. So i  was considering buying the serum from same line, then i read one of the reviews saying this contains carcinogen for preservative. went to Avalon website and got the full ingredient list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice(1), Aqua (Water), C10-18 Triglycerides, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil(1), Polyglyceryl-6 Distearate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil(1), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter(1), Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Borago Officinalis Seed Oil(1), Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Seed Oil(1), Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil(1), Arnica Montana Flower Extract(1), Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract(1), Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract(1), Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract(1), Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Extract*, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract(1), Olea Europaea(Olive) Leaf Extract(1), Saccharomyces/Xylinum/Black Tea Ferment(1), Algin, Ascorbic Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Alcohol(1), Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Citral, Limonene, Linalool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looked up sodium benzoate and found following articles:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Spa From Scratch.com:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One known cancer danger exists related to sodium benzoate. If you combine ascorbic acid (vitamin C) with sodium benzoate and potassium benzoate (another preservative), you get benzene. Benzene is a known carcinogen. Most of the benzene exposure comes from the environment including cigarette smoke, car exhaust, industrial waste and service stations. Some benzene exposure can also come from contaminated food and water. Some soft drinks have been removed from the market when they were found to contain benzene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From: http://www.webmd.com/diet/features/the-truth-about-seven-common-food-additives?page&#x3D;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why it&#x27;s controversial&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s suspected that sodium benzoate, in addition to artificial food color, may increase hyperactivity in some children. Sodium benzoate in soft drinks may also react with added vitamin C to make benzene, a cancer-causing substance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream and the serum from same line exactly combines: ascorbic acid (vitamin C) with sodium benzoate and potassium benzoate &#x3D; benzene&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How could an organic company do this? I am horrified.rified.</li>
    <li> It makes my face/skin feel great! I haven&#x27;t seen any changes yet. I use it every day and will continue using it.</li>
    <li> Combine it with Hayluronic Acid Serum and see your skin morph into the skin you should&#x27;ve been born with and you probably have but didn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;tools\\&quot; to take care of it. Well, now you do. Recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;07/06/14&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to add this: I had a huge patch of darkened skin on my forehead and it was there for years, but after using this cream- it&#x27;s gone. And not only that: vitamin C evens the tone of your skin - I&#x27;m a living prove. Do yourself a favor and for $13 bucks make your skin look gorges.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it with a microneedle roller. Amazing results. Acne scars, red blotches, uneven skin all gone! I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Love it- use it everyday!</li>
    <li> I love this cream. My skin is definitely smoother and all my pimples were gone. It is better than other expensive creams.</li>
    <li> Great for acne scars!!! Absolutely amazing results. It does sting a little on my sensitive skin, but no redness or rad or puffinessbhas occurred, I assume its just the Vitamin C going to work! Great results. Been using it for a week and can already see my acne scars will be completely gone within a month or so. Such powerful lightening of the scars!</li>
    <li> Love this creme and the way it feels and smells on my skin without most of these chemicals.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Around this time of year my face seems to get dry. This helps keep my skin fresh and moisturized. Has a slight citrus sent, but not overwhelming. Will buy this product again soon!</li>
    <li> This is the best facial cream that I&#x27;ve tried. I have been using it for years and I have problematic skin. It goes on smoothly, does not leave any oily feeling and is made from natural ingredients. What more can I ask for.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! It really works! Highly recommended. Used other products before but none has worked as good as this one.</li>
    <li> Smells like a dream. Did seem to lighten some areas up. It just didn&#x27;t quite produce the effects I was seeking personally.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  It really  feel good on skin and not greasy.</li>
    <li> not too heavy and has a very nice scent and the price is very reasonable . I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> When I first ordered this product from Amazon, I was thrilled. It was light and creamy, absorbed quickly and smelled amazing. When I ran out, I had no qualms about ordering a multipack. However, when I opened the first jar, I first noticed that the label was different (off-white and orange) as compared to my previous jar (all orange - like in the product picture). Then I quickly realized that the product I had loved was also EXTREMELY different. This new formula does not absorb AT ALL. I was using a pea-sized amount for my whole face and rubbing and rubbing it in forever to get any benefit. When I opened the next box in my multipack, I was happy to see that it was the old formula (all-orange label). BE CAREFUL - you don&#x27;t know which one you&#x27;re going to get!!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It smells wonderful.  My husband like the smell also.  Not sure about the renewal part but my skin seems to look better.</li>
    <li> I have fairly dry skin and have used several different creams/lotions to find one that I like, and that is decently priced. This one works great! I only apply to the face. I&#x27;ve used it now for a month and definitely see and feel a difference. It absorbs into the skin and doesn&#x27;t make my face look greasy, just no longer flaky/dry. It also has a pleasant, faint, citrus smell that fades away after applying. I&#x27;ve used others, more expensive ($25 for 2 oz), that I&#x27;d have to reapply or my skin would appear dry towards the end of the day. I just apply this in the morning and I&#x27;m good for the entire day. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Good and moderately priced. It feels moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Would not be without this product.  I buy this product in bulk.  From the first time I used it I noticed such a difference in my skin.  I am 66 years old and do not like chemical laden products.  This uses your own body processes to draw water to the skin to soften and smooth the surface.  I give it to my friends and faithfully use it at least once a day sometimes twice prior to bed.  The product is, by far, less expensive than the fancy bottles with the brand names on it and it is natural.  No smell and safe works great for me!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer, but for some reason, my skin turned red and blotchy after use. I also felt hot and itchy on some ares of my face after use. It did moisturize well, though I must be allergic to something in it. I find this odd as I have used other vitamin c products before with good results.</li>
    <li> It is light weight so I use it under my makeup or just for extra moisture.  You can smell the citrus which is invigorating.  would recommend</li>
    <li> Ordered 2/14 and as of today, 2/26 no product and the tracking feature is unavailable. Not sure where in the world this product is shipping from but can assure you, it&#x27;s not worth the wait. Ridiculous.</li>
    <li> Love this so much that I put in a blender and mix with other products.  The smell is wonderful</li>
    <li> New formulation is very smooth and makes skin quite supple after overnight application. May be a bit too heavy for daytime wear. Of course, only recommended for night time.</li>
    <li> Bought this from Whole Foods for $25... After ONE use, it gave me red and irritated and perpetually dry blotches in the area under each corner of my mouth... I DO NOT have sensitive skin and nothing like this has ever happened to me before.  I tried moisturizer for a while and am now using cortisone cream but nothing is working to get rid of the flaking, red blotches this crap cream caused.  Gotta go to the dermatologist.  Two months of having to heavily conceal this irritation.</li>
    <li> So far this cream works well. If this continues I will place more orders as needed. I have no more words to put.</li>
    <li> I got it in time and iv been using it for 3 days now. I applay it rite after i wash my face and it leaves my face feeling amazing and looking younger plus my husband says my skin feels like baby skin hehe. My foreheads always been very oily and get pimples cus of it i have tried other vreams but they just made my forehead even more oily and somehow make my skin feel soficated but thank goodness i found this face cream it keeps my forehead soft all day long. I live in california and it gets pretty hot here and i dont get oily anymore and havent got more pimples!! :D i feel more confident now. the only thing i dont like about it is that it smell wierd.. before buying it i read the reviwes saying it just smells like oranges but it really smells like oranges mixed with cinnamon and i dont really like the smell but i still give it 5 stars cus the smell doesnt last that long wich i lovlove. I would defenetly recommend this facial cream 100% to eeveryone!!! You wont regret it I promise!!!</li>
    <li> Smells great and feels great.  Don&#x27;t know what effect it will have on my skin in the long-run.</li>
    <li> One of the top 5 vitamin products for your  face ( PREVENTION mag online).  Avalon has changed ingredients since.  I just tried this this morning.  a little oily,  slighty stronger citrus smell than i really care for.  What concerns me is that Avalon has added sodium benzoate to the mix ( Three seperate websites).  Sodium Benzoate when mixed with vitamin C creates Benzene a known Carcinogen. Look it up yourself, then decide if it&#x27;s worth the risk.  One website recoomends Eucerin Q10 for a Vitamin C cream.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial cream I have ever used, even have my daughter using it.  Very smooth and light, love it.</li>
    <li> Have used this for many years.  I love the Vitamin C.  My only complaint would be that it is very thick.  The moisturizer is now too thin.  Maybe they can strike a balance!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this cream - nice consistency, too.</li>
    <li> Very nicely scented (to me it smells like orange), very creamy which goes a long way, you don&#x27;t need to use very much, and your skin will love the way it moisturizes!  In just a couple of weeks I&#x27;ve noticed a younger looking appearance in my skin.  I will continue to use this as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> Love that this face cream is organic and the price is just right.  It has a silky texture and soaks right in.  Does not look or feel greasy after application. 4/5/16 - they changed the formula :(  it&#x27;s very thin and drips off my fingers.  I don&#x27;t feel at all hydrated after application.  Will no longer purchase.</li>
    <li> This cream  is thick and not the easiest to spread so I use more, which may be by design. It contains an unknown amount of vitamin c (What&#x27;s the big secret?). I use it twice a day with Avalon&#x27;s orange cleanser. I also take photoceramide supplements. After a month&#x27;s use, my skin feels smoother but my age spots have not changed. I am going to make my own vit c serum to see if it affects my age spots. There is a recipe for DIY vit c serum at healthbeautyandskincareproducts.com/how-to-make-a-homemade-vitamin-c-serum.</li>
    <li> IT IS EXACTLY THE INGREDIENTS THAT WERE RECOMMENDED TO ME BUT IT DOES CAUSE A BIT OF REDNESS, PEELING IF YOU USE IT EVERY DAY. i REDUCED IT TO 3x A WEEK.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an organic girl, so this decision was easy. I love the creaminess and it has a wonderful light orange scent. I apply before bed and in the morning after I shower. Second time I&#x27;ve purchased this item and I&#x27;ll keep going back.</li>
    <li> I bought this item because I read about vitamin C being good for your skin and it is advertised as all natural. I like the ingredients, but it has a really strong smell that gets annoying, even if you like it. It also ended up irritating my skin, natural does not mean non-irritating. It has orange peel oil, which I am allergic to, to I had to return it.&lt;br /&gt;I found a brand with natural ingredients, a nicer more mellow smell and no irritation (alba botanica), which I like better, for about the same price.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this yet. It has to be partnered with the phytoceramide to work. This was recommended by Dr. Oz for reversing the signs of aging, hydrating the skin. Along with the phytoceramide this will be a face lift without having to spend the money it costs for one.</li>
    <li> very nice product at a great price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it&#x27;s still my favorite moisturizer! It keeps my face so soft and doesn&#x27;t smell too strong, just a light orange scent. i recommend it</li>
    <li> Love this cream.  It makes my face so smooth and soft.  No more dry skin and works as a great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This cream is my all time favorite, I use many different face creams and I have to say this one never irritates my skin at all,it barely has a smell to it which is a good thing!!!</li>
    <li> Feels great for so little cost. Love how it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
    <li> I went to get a facial and the lady told me that I should be using skin care products with vitamin C due to my skin type. I am very fair with freckles and sensitive skin-oily combination skin. She said that photo damage should be my biggest concern. So I went to Amazon and found this product (as well as the Vitamin C Gel Cleanser) with great reviews at a reasonable price. I have used both this and the cleanser for a short amount of time and can already notice a difference! My hyper-pigmentation seems muted and my skin is very smooth and calm. It hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation what so ever. I have used other common store brands as well as other VERY expensive department store brands and I can honestly say that this seems to provide me with the best results so far. I will continue to purchase this.</li>
    <li> This is the best reasonably priced facial cream on the market, in my estimation.  It absorbs easily, has the best smell (light citrus) of any facial cream I have ever used, is 70% organic, contains no harmful phthalates, sulfates, or parabens, and as an added bonus has an SPF of 15!  Also, there is no animal testing involved</li>
    <li> I tend to break out but also have dry skin. This cream works really well for me on both counts.</li>
    <li> I USED to love this product.  Please heed everyone else&#x27;s comments that are recent!  They have significantly changed this product.  It used to have a wonderful soft orange scent - now it smells chemically.  It used to leave my skin feeling soft and refreshed - I used this, and ended up having to wash it off because my skin felt tight, and the smell was making me nauseous.  All the positive reviews are from the previous formula.  If the box says new formula on the top, DON&#x27;T BUY IT!!!!  Of course, there is no way of knowing on Amazon, so I would keep looking if I were you.  If you can manage to find the old formula in a store somewhere, get it!  It was fantastic.  But now it is terrible.  I am so bummed, because I have super sensitive skin and hate to have to find new products.  If anyone has any suggestions, I&#x27;m listening!</li>
    <li> while searching the net I found this product. We live in the Sonoran desert and really need all the help with our skin as the sun is very intense at times. My wife and myself find this product very good for our skin. We noticed a big difference after we started using it.&lt;br /&gt;  We will continue to purchase this product for healthier skin.</li>
    <li> Eh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not much difference in minimizing my wrinkles...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I have to give it more time?  But how much longer?</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this and I was excited when I bought it, but it made my face burn every single time. I tried using less, thinking I put on too much. Even when I used a very thin layer over a cream/moisturizer, it still made my face burn.&lt;br /&gt;It smells like oranges with chemicals. Note that I bought the new formula, and it seems a lot of people are also warning against the new formula of the Avalon organically vitamin c line.</li>
    <li> I love everything Avalon Organics. I use every product they make for facial skin care. After doing much research, I learned that Vitamin C is a key ingredient in the expensive products and that is what they market. I can get everything I could want in skin care with this line at a reasonable price, organic, no animal testing and container made from recycled products. I think it is just as good if not better than the expensive products I purchased from a high end skin clinic. I am an older woman and do not expect to look 10 years younger, but have been getting many compliments on my skin.</li>
    <li> Totally delighted with this product. Fragrance is awesome, cream sooo smooth, my skin is in love. It arrived quickly and is as described. Thank you. I just ordered another jar of it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cream about a month and a half ago and noticed a difference the first week. I am in my mid 50&#x27;s and have pronounced lines around my eyes and mouth and they have diminished. I also have problem acne prone skin and this product has soothed my breakouts as well. It goes on light and does not have a heavy greasy feel. I like the light fragrance and I have recommended it to all my friends. Great product for decent price. Well worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t break me out( and I have very oily skin) use day and night</li>
    <li> Nice product. Wish it was thicker.</li>
    <li> Love it! Love it! Love It! I can&#x27;t say enough about Avalon Organics. I received my purchase within a few days. The cream is wonderful! It feels good going on and it makes my face soft and smooth, and it stay moist all day. I used to have dry patchy skin on my face but this cream has changed that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream day and night for about a month now. My hyperpigmentation has already begun to fade somewhat, and my smile lines are reduced. I use this in conjunction with a Clairsonic, Effaclar Face Wash, a dermaroller, and Vit C serum. I&#x27;m already getting compliments on my skin.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin soft and smooth with Vitamin C.  Tell you at the end of the jar if it&#x27;s been successful.</li>
    <li> use it every day, male 25, its nice stuff. keeps my face moisturized i have dry skin. put it on after a shower. its good but i dont know what is really great or bad when it comes to this stuff. just kinda picked this one out.</li>
    <li> Soft and readily absorbed -</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Product is and does what is picture and described.</li>
    <li> The new formula burned my wife&#x27;s face!!!!DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination of some products are creating Benzene which burn the skin</li>
    <li> Love this face cream!  Perfectly moisturizing without that greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I tend to look a little bit younger than my age as is, but having used this every night for a few weeks people are commenting daily that my face looks so fresh and healthy! Taking care of your body is about more than just eating good food and exercising - your skin can also greatly benefit from attention and this has proved it to me no question.</li>
    <li> Love it! It has light consistency and smells and feels great on skin. I bought this one instead of Avalon Vit C serum as it runs out so fast. This one last longer and feels better on skin. So far, no acne scars thanks to this product!</li>
    <li> I like this product I care about my face the wind and Sun is strong for are face. The sun causes damage to face and wrinkles in time we all get old by slowing  the process and taken care of  ourselves helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had anything but positive results from vitamin C, except for when I tried this product. I stopped putting it on my face because it consistently gave me pimples.</li>
    <li> Excellent item. I recommend</li>
    <li> nice for nite time, needed a thicker cream and feels nice</li>
    <li> Love this cream for keeping my skin moist and also love the smell.  It is light and works well with additional creams.</li>
    <li> If this stuff is truly non-toxic, it&#x27;s earned five stars from me. I use it twice daily and my skin stays smooth and clear. It&#x27;s light, no odor, and my facial skin feels good after I apply it.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent cream for dry skin. Not an anti-wrinkle as it has not retinols or peptides, but I use to give my skin a &amp;#34;rest&amp;#34; from the stronger creams.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and the price is right!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for sometime and I like it.I find that I am allergic to many of the others and the Avalon Organics does not give me a reaction plus it has a pleasant smell and I find it makes my skin very soft. I would recommend it to others who have problems finding a facial cream that is gentle but effective.</li>
    <li> I really love it this product, my skin was suffering from thinness because of another harsh cream, and I purchased this in hopes of it thickening my skin. I read somewhere that vitamin C helps with thin skin so I decided to try out this product and it helped me a lot. Now I&#x27;m ordering my second one.  and I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I have had great results with this product.  It is very light and blends into the skin leaving no residue.  My skin feels smoother and looks firmer.  You can&#x27;t beat it for the price.  And the wonderful citrus scent is refreshing.  I will definitely order again and also try other Avalon Organic products.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday and love it! Amazon is great!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer with nice scent.  I use this for my main moisturizer, they have made it creamier which I like, it is light and not too heavy and has a nice light citrus scent.  It lasts for several months and then I order again, the Amazon price is several dollars cheaper than Walmart and Walgreens locally..  It is gentle and does not cause irritation or redness which some can do.  Really like it and have used this product for about 7-8 years now.</li>
    <li> Absorbs great and moisturizes my skin!</li>
    <li> Do not see any change in an old wrinkled face.</li>
    <li> I love this cream!! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Hands down my favorite moisturizing face cream.  I upgraded from less expensive creams and have to say it&#x27;s made a big difference in how hydrated my skin now feels.  Definitely recommend this cream.</li>
    <li> Love it, have bought over &amp; over.</li>
    <li> amazing product i swear by and so much cheaper then in stores !!! thank you and i received it in two days &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I have been looking to try this product and the price was so good that I bought two jars. Hopefully it will be worth it!!</li>
    <li> In combo with Hyaluronic Acid this is a killer combo! Works! Put the Hyaluronic Acid acid first and then this lotion, it does the job better than 500+ creams do!</li>
    <li> I had purchased this product from Wal-Mart and was excellent for my face.  My complexion glowed.  Once they changed the formula, I broke out and returned it to Wal-Mart.  I called the company and I asked if I could purchase the old product and found this is not an option when it&#x27;s sold out everywhere.  Too bad when you try to fix something that doesn&#x27;t need fixing.  I need to find a new Vitamin C truly organic product.  Beware of the additive, it&#x27;s not Organic.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer, especially for the price. It&#x27;s very creamy, not oily, and has added benefit of Vitamin C.</li>
    <li> FAN-FREAKING-TASTIC, my skin feels amazing, its not heavy, and a little bit goes a long way! The smell is pretty nice too</li>
    <li> Like the feel and love the smell of this cream.  It&#x27;s a good one for use as a night cream.</li>
</ol>
