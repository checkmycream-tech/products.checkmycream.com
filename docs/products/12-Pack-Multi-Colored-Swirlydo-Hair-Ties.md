<li> They really work and don&#x27;t leave a dent in your hair the way all other pony tail holders/bands do.  </li>
<li> The pony tail falls down in 2 seconds.</li>
<li> so I use less than half of them.</li>
<li> They do leave a bit of a pony line, but after my hair is down for a few minutes, it goes away.</li>
<li> I use these at the gym, then let my hair down for work and NO DENT!  </li>
<li> Unfortunately when order arrived the colors I received were different from the picture, which was very disappointing since most of the color I wanted did not arrive.</li>
<li> They help me create a messy bun.</li>
<li> There are no more headaches or rubberband lines in my hair.  </li>
<li> Went looking and found these and thought even if they come out in the water at least they will float.</li>
<li> These are for people with thick hair or else you have to twist them around your pony tail a couple times.  </li>
<li> BUT i got all the very ugly colors and pretty disappointed.</li>
<li> I understand that is is sorted colors to be shipped in a 12 pack by random</li>
<li> These seems like fake swirly dos.</li>
<li> I have very thin hair though.</li>
<li> None of the colors in the picture were shipped - so very sad.</li>
<li> I GOT ALL THE UGLY COLORS &#x3D;(</li>
<li> SO DISAPPOINTED!</li>

    <li> Quick shipping and loved the item!!!</li>
    <li> Great for holding hair without leaving marks so you can put your hair up &amp; take it down without worries.  Unfortunately, not a lot of pretty colors so I use less than half of them.</li>
    <li> these are knock off Swirlydos they don&#x27;t hold the hair as well and they stretch out after 1 use so you cant use again</li>
    <li> I use them every day at work and the gym. Super comfortable doesn&#x27;t pull,out my hair at all stays in place even when I surf.</li>
    <li> These are so great!! They feel like a telephone cord. They hold your hair in place and allow you to make a really cute messy bun.</li>
    <li> Started swimming and found cloth pony tail holders would come out and sink to bottom of pool.  Went looking and found these and thought even if they come out in the water at least they will float. So I bought them and gave them a try and much to my surprise they work wonderfully. They don&#x27;t come out while swimming but if you do drop one it floats.  They are extremely comfortable to wear too I have fell asleep with them in and they do not bother me.  I have also noticed they don&#x27;t seem to pull my hair out like cloth ones do.  I love these and plan to buy many more.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter gave me a hair tie like these. I loved it so much I wanted more. I found these and the price is great. The quality is excellent and the colors are great.</li>
    <li> stretches out and will not hold a nice pony tail or bun - do not purchase these for hair ties</li>
    <li> I love this hair ties, I purchased this item because the picture showed several color I have not been able to find at stores.  Unfortunately when order arrived the colors I received were different from the picture, which was very disappointing since most of the color I wanted did not arrive.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t care for these at all! They stretch out &amp; stay that way. The pony tail falls down in 2 seconds. UGH</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE HAIR TIES!! They help me create a messy bun. I have very thin hair though. Also make my pony tails look thicker. The ONLY problem I have with this purchase is that they do not come in the colors that are shown. I am debating whether to return them because I got a bunch of neutral colors and ugly oranges instead of the bright happy colors I love.</li>
    <li> They are just kind of bulky to wear on your wrist like a normal hair tie.  They do leave a bit of a pony line, but after my hair is down for a few minutes, it goes away.</li>
    <li> These seems like fake swirly dos.</li>
    <li> There are no more headaches or rubberband lines in my hair.  The colors go with all my outfits.  Waterproof and easy to use.</li>
    <li> These are for people with thick hair or else you have to twist them around your pony tail a couple times.  I also bought the pack of 30 which are much smaller.  They really work and don&#x27;t leave a dent in your hair the way all other pony tail holders/bands do.  I use these at the gym, then let my hair down for work and NO DENT!  I gave some to my personal trainer and to my granddaughter.</li>
    <li> Good lot, and nice colors!</li>
    <li> I originally bought a few of these at my hairdressers. One broke and I didn&#x27;t want to pay $3 for one so I bought 12 for $1 each. They work as promised. You don&#x27;t get the crease in your hair and I love the many colors to go with outfits. I keep one in my gym bag and my purse. Love them.</li>
    <li> These are great!  Love the colors!</li>
    <li> I understand that is is sorted colors to be shipped in a 12 pack by random BUT i got all the very ugly colors and pretty disappointed. I received none of the colors that displayed in the picture when purchasing the item.    SO DISAPPOINTED! I GOT ALL THE UGLY COLORS &#x3D;( None of the colors in the picture were shipped - so very sad. However, they did offer a refund for the hair toes. Just beware</li>
    <li> They hold your hair very well, pretty much do as described the seller had a very nice note in package about wanting you to be completely satisfied.  I was impressed with a note with hair ties, just don&#x27;t see that type of customer service anymore but of course we are dealing with Amazon as far as I am concern KING of customer service.</li>
