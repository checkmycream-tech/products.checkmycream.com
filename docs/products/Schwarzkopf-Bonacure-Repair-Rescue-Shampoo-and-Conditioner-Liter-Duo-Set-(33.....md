      <li>ok so where do i start?</li>

    <li> This shampoo is awesome, I accidentally ordered 2 sets of these, let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;ll probably last me a whole year, It smells very nice and my hair feels so good after washing with this! I got these very fast in a big box, packaged and protected very good!! Overall It&#x27;s great, does not build up and best of all WHAT A GREAT PRICE!!</li>
    <li> I really damaged my hair with a cheap flat iron - am getting quicker results with this product, Schwarzkopf&#x27;s anti-frizz gel, and Chi Infra Silk Infusion.  I DO have to keep styling my hair, after all!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner makes my hair so healthy and it&#x27;s so much cheaper to buy in the big bottles on here than in the stores. Comes with pumps too. I need products that nourish my hair since I dye it, but also doesn&#x27;t weigh it down because I have thin hair. This works great</li>
    <li> This is definitely counterfeit.  And it smells like ant spray.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine but thick hair.  Fine hair breaks easily, no matter how healthy.  My breakage when I&#x27;m using this combo is almost NONE.  It&#x27;s amazing, works great, and I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is truly a product that everyone needs to try.  Once you try it you will never use anything else</li>
    <li> This product arrived in a timely manner and is what I intended it to be.  I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> THis product is awesome, but the service of this seller exceeds the expectations. A must-buy forever from this guys! 1000%</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful for the hair especially if you&#x27;ve straightened it like me! Makes the hair soft and flowy and i love running my fingers through it!  thumbs up to the seller!</li>
    <li> This is not at all what I expected. Used the BC Bonacure repair and rescue leave in conditioner and it is fantastic. It smells great as well. Unfortunately I bought this duo set of the shampoo and conditioner repair rescue and it is horrible! It has no smell at all!  When I used the conditioner it irritated my scalp.  Not sure if this product is authentic.  Would buy from a salon better than online.  Would never buy this product from this vender again.  Wish I was able to get a refund!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always known I loved this product and was thrilled to find a vendor who sells it for such a good price.  I&#x27;ve bought from this vendor in the past and am consistently happy with my order.  Not only is the price fantastic but the shipping prices are fantastic too, the customer service is top notch, and I always receive my items quicker than expected.  Recently, Schwarzkopf changed the formula of their Bonacure Rescue and I wasn&#x27;t aware.  The vendor emailed me to inform me of this and offered me the money back guarantee if I didn&#x27;t like the formula change - which is more than I would expect.    Turns out, I do like the formula change and will buy from this vendor again and again.</li>
    <li> clean and smells good</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best :) got here pretty fast too.</li>
    <li> The product sells for much more at a salon.  I was happy to find it on amazon.  The product arrived promptly as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo and conditioner for almost a year but this is first time I bought it from them. Great price for great product.  This product really made my dry, frizzy and unmanageable hair smooth and soft.  Schwarzkopf Bonacure Repair Rescue Shampoo and Conditioner Liter Duo Set (33.8 Oz)</li>
    <li> ok so where do i start? i cut my hair, i hated it. i ordered this shampoo and conditioner and i am amazed!!!! i have been using this great magical stuff for a little over a month now and i havent measured my hair yet but i believe it has grown about 2inches in this month. wow!wow!wow! not only that, i have super thick coarse hair, which i have always hated but with the bonacure shamp and cond my hair so soft, shiny, manageable, and i simply love it. ohhhh and lets not forget to mention about the compliments i get on texture and scent. everybody loves the way it smells. its the best stuff my hair could have ever experienced.</li>
    <li> I have previously used this product and absolutely loved. It made my hair so soft, healthy, and shiny.  But the product that I received through my purchase here at amazon.com was counterfeit.  It was not the real schwarzkopf bonacure repair rescue shampoo and conditioner.  The shampoo smells the same but is very watered down and doesn&#x27;t lather as well as the real product.  And the conditioner was not even close.  The actual conditioner is very creamy and moisturizing.  The conditioner I received from amazon felt like water and did nothing for my hair but did cause me to have an allergic reaction.  The real Schwarzkopf bonacure shampoo and conditioner never once caused me to have any allergic reaction, the only reaction it caused was beautiful soft shiny hair</li>
    <li> It was so dumb of me to buy for $100 from a store only for licenced hair stylist, what a discount huh? the price from this vender is AMAZING, deff a must.</li>
    <li> I had purchases the shampoo and conditioner through a salon earlier - the product from amazon did not feel the same - seems more like a counterfeit.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo/conditioner I have ever used.  It is wonderful for damaged hair.  Works well with color treated hair as well.  The bottles are large and worth the money.  They also have something to put on your ends after.  Also a great products.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner has helped strengthen my hair, its a great product and its great for daily use!! My hair never feels weighed down, and the price is perfect for the amount you get!</li>
    <li> Did not get the same results as one purchased in salons, maybe its expired</li>
    <li> This Shampoo from Schwarzkopf is the best I ever had, try it and you will love it, my Hair use to be so try and damaged now its nice and shiny ! thanks Schwarzkopf</li>
    <li> I have very damaged ends, and thin hair. This is one of the few products that has improved the condition of my hair. Even my hairdresser mentioned the change! Personally the first time I smelled it, I didn&#x27;t care for it although, I now love it! It makes my hair smell fresh for a long time. It also makes my hair very soft, and easy to brush through when it is wet. This is the second set of bottles I have purchased. I still have a lot of the conditioner from the first set left, since I shampoo two to three times. This is such a great price compared to Bumble and Bumble, which is what I had used before this. It didn&#x27;t come with free shipping when I ordered it though. My hairdresser sells this for $50 in her store. This is a great deal!</li>
    <li> Pump came not working</li>
    <li> I always used this product. Was happy to know it was not so costly in amazon. It works like charm on my hair making it soft and silky. And was delivered on time. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Excellent - Item delivered on time, was as described, great customer service</li>
    <li> I really like Schwarzkopf&#x27;s Bonacure Repair Rescue Shampoo &amp; Conditioner. It leaves the hair extremely clean and smelling wonderful. Great for long hair that gets knots in it easily.</li>
    <li> Previous version of Schwartzkopf Bonacure was wonderful. The texture, aroma and results were great and friends and strangers alike commented often on my hair quality, as well as the wonderful aroma. This version changed and diminished the quality in each of these attributes. I will no longer purchase these products.</li>
    <li> For some reason after I bought this shampoo, strangers are now smelling my hair more and more. I don&#x27;t know whether to praise this shampoo for its awesomeness, or be afraid of its magical powers.</li>
    <li> Very good...more then I need♥ I love the products, my hair is shine,soft,strong,smell so good,sure I&#x27;m so happy✴i just want buy more products .</li>
    <li> This duo set is very very good, my hair is very shiny and beautifull.I will buy another time for sure</li>
    <li> LOve the way it leaves my hair. no residue, and rinses clean. Good bargain for price verses size. Schwarzkopf makes a great product</li>
    <li> Sadly this product is NOT what I expected :(&lt;br /&gt;It was way too pricey and in the end I think I&#x27;m better off with supermarket shampoo since the conditioner doesn&#x27;t condition or softens. Everytime I used it, I had the most terrible hair nots :(</li>
    <li> My son wanted this shampoo and he loves it. He uses it everyday. I think it is good value for the money and it appears that the affects are noticeable.</li>
    <li> I have very straight hair. I like this product&lt;br /&gt;because it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down</li>
    <li> I read the reviews suggesting that the conditioner was counterfeit but decided to go for it anyway because of the price.  However, if the conditioner is real, it is heavily diluted.  It is easy to pour the conditioner right out of the bottle even though previous bottles that I purchased from other companies contained a much thicker solution.  If you like the real product, purchase it elsewhere!</li>
    <li> The product itself is fantastic, rejuv &amp; repair astonishing. Service was horrible. I received half of the full product order. There was no rectification.  I eventually ended up repurchasing the exact same order.  The second shipment had the complete order.  I was never refunded...VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!!  Amazon.com did NOT meet my customer service expectations here.</li>
    <li> Great price for an excellent product. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I loved Bonacure and for some reason these ones that I purchased did not meet my expectations. Not sure what it was, but they never left my hair soft and silky like Bonacure usually does. I ended up throwing it away, I may try it again one day but maybe buy it through somewhere else</li>
    <li> Always use this and it&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> i love this shampoo, after a long time of using it, I can say my hair is in perfect condition and had been restored from all the damage I have made to it...</li>
    <li> This is not real. I just wish I would have read the reviews first.</li>
    <li> I have fine, color treated hair. I have always used salon products, But since using these products my hair is healthier than it has been in years. It actually shines now and my color lasts a lot longer. Try it. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> It saves a damaged hair chemically treated! It leaves your smooth and shiny! It last a while not much product needed to be applied for excellent results!</li>
    <li> Great stuff, does exactly what its supposed to do. Can not be more happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Didnt do anything it said it would do for my hair. Doesnt heal, doesnt protect, doesnt do anything.. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I like how this shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair feeling. I was first introduced to Schwarzkopf by my stylist, but at the salon it&lt;br /&gt;was very expensive. So when I saw this deal on Amazon, I jumped on it. It seems to be just as good as the smaller more expensive one from the salon.</li>
    <li> ...its watered down and feels like some cheap brand, like Suave. while the shampoo is the normal awesome Bonacure, I am NOT happy with the conditioner, which is why I gave it only three stars. I have heard it&#x27;s risky to purchased this product but this is the first time that I&#x27;ve had an inferior product.</li>
    <li> i bought the set and received only the condicioner. i stayed at usa more 10 days and they dont send the shampoo.</li>
    <li> Felt that it is Great product with great value for both shampoo and conditioner.But when received the product the seal was open.not sure if an used one or sample piece is sold</li>
    <li> My hair is conditioned and in good shape because of this product.  For those who need the extra help, this item really works.  Really helps with dry and dull colored hair.  My hair is also wavy and coarse and this product really helped get me to the condition I am in now.  I only needed about a weeks worth to get back my lustrous hair.  Highly recommend for colored, dry hair that needs help with moisture, shine, and control.</li>
    <li> Make sure when you get them one is shampoo and another one is conditioner. They are  sent them to me 2 shampoos</li>
    <li> Conditioner is not the same consistency that I am used to. Severe hair fall since I started using this duo set.</li>
    <li> this product was used by a hairdresser in georgia - although i was only visiting georgia, this shampoo and creme rinse was one of my best \\&quot;finds\\&quot; - not only do i love the stuff (if you have dry hair, THIS is the ticket!!), but this is the 2nd order ive placed thru this company (for the same products) and it arrives QUICK, packed well and a whole lot cheaper than the smaller bottles i bought at the hairdressers in ga - thank you guys!!</li>
    <li> This product is great for damaged hair with breakage. I used this along with a keratin and argan oil supplement for when my hair is dry and my hair was very damaged and fried from straightening with a too hot flat iron and these products are definitely helping to repair it. I am hoping that by the time these huge bottles are empty my hair will be back to a healthy condition. I will continue to use this brand&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> good stuff but with  the price increase from $25 to $41, i wont be buying it agin</li>
    <li> No I didn&#x27;t like it. These is not the same product which I bought from saloon. My hair fall is heavy .</li>
    <li> I bought this from Amazon - My girlfriend has been using this since last 3 years - And this is first time we got this big pack - But she swears this is not original. Buyer Beware.</li>
    <li> makes my curly/frizzy hair manageable. Gives hair volume and smells good too.  I wish it had come with a pump insert though.  It is kind of heavy to lift up and pour out.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  Works well on fine and color treated hair.  Gives volume.  Does flattened out hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for over 13 years.  There have been a couple of times I have ran out and have had to use my Husband&#x27;s \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; stuff.  I instantly run out to get this product.  It makes a huge difference with how my hair feels and styles.  I won&#x27;t use anything else.  All of the Schwarzkopf products are amazing.  You get what you pay for - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This stuff is such a superior product to anything you can possibly buy off the shelf.  Now, there may be more expensive stuff out there, but this works for me.  I have fine hair, but lots of it.  Every day I have to wash and blow-dry it - sometimes I can take Saturdays and Sundays off, but depending on my schedule, I&#x27;m using Schwarzkopf 5 to 6 days out of 7.  My hair looks healthy when I use Schwarzkopf.</li>
    <li> been using this shampoo and conditioner for a long time and I will use it for as long as I can</li>
    <li> I purchased the Repair rescue shampoo, conditioner and sealed ends from a recommendation by a cosmotologist who hightly recommened it. I bought it from a beauty supply that sells only the \\&quot;trade\\&quot;.  So I know it was real. I was anticipating having my soft, shiny, manageble hair,  what I got was dry, hard, cruchy hair. The conditioner should make hair feel like butter, after washing the conditioner out, it felt like I didnt apply any conditioner at all, my hair was hard to manage and hard to comb. The sealed ends product did nothing!!! I had to use so much of each product, that should have been clue. I spent quite a bit of money and I&#x27;m not a satisfied customer. I knew from the first wash, that this product was junk. It should not take several washes to see if a products works. After reading other post, it appears this is reformulated, and they missed the mark on this!!! I&#x27;m throwing all the products out.</li>
    <li> I always buy this product....but for some reason the conditioner has changed and it is horrible</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!!! My hair color last longer and there&#x27;s no build up.  Also, the smell of both shampoo and conditioner is just so YUMMY!!!</li>
    <li> I had purchased this item about 2 months back, when my Original 250 ml Shampoo and 200 ml Conditioner can were about to get over. I was really liking the products i was using, so i decided to order them in Big Packs. But it turned out a horrible mistake for me.&lt;br /&gt;I started using shampoo after 1 month of purchase and found it was a bit different than what i had been using, but it was still okay. One week ago when i opened the conditioner, i was very much shocked. The Texture of the original conditioner vs the one came in 1 lt. pack were way different. This product when applied to hair felt as if my hair would all stick together. I am very much disappointed by my purchase and would not recommend anyone to buy it. Better go for smaller usuall packs.</li>
    <li> Only issue I had was, when the product arrived both bottles were shampoo. When I ordered a combo pack that was to be 1 shampoo and 1 conditioner. The product itself was great</li>
    <li> Good price and on time</li>
    <li> Not the queality that I expect from this brand. While shampoo does clean the hair, the conditioner does absolutely nothing</li>
    <li> I have used this product before, this is not the same.. This shampoo and conditioner left my hair even more dry than it was before.. I tried to use for a month thinking it was just my hair. This conditioner left my hair so dry I couldn&#x27;t comb out the tangles, I had to put leave in conditioner that I had on hand in order to comb out my hair. I will never order this product from the internet....  its not the same!! I went and bought some pantene shampoo and conditioner and it has done more than this repair and rescue.</li>
    <li> Works very well for my hear. I would recommend for someone who dyes his/her hair, it is very gentle on the dye and it last much longer if you would you use it instead generic shampoo.</li>
    <li> Please note that the 2 stars given are based on what in my opinion seems to be a sub-par product purchased from this vendor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had originally purchased the duo set from a reputable salon (brick and mortal shop) some time ago and when I compared the Shampoo and Conditioner bought this time around they were not the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that threw me off was the product labeling.  The Schwarzkopf Bonacure Repair line used to use a light blue and red labeling on the bottles.  These bottles contained the red and white labeling.  I now realize this is not an issue since it appears like they have changed to the red and white bottle labeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing to concern me was the quality of the product itself.  I still had some of the original shampoo and conditioner previously purchased from the salon and the smell and consistency were different as well.  I read the labels to compare them and the ingredients in each of the bottles were the same.  I even poured a bit on my finger to compare the consistency between them and I still had my doubts.  At this point I was just convincing myself that I was making a big deal out of nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is where point #2 will start to make sense.  It is when I finally used the shampoo and conditioner that I knew they were not the same as what I had purchased before.  The quality of the conditioner had a watered-down consistency and the feel of my hair after rinsing it off was just incredibly different.  The hair felt dry and I felt as if I had purchased a low-quality sub-par product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that when purchasing this product at retail price it is not cheap.  In fact the duo set I had bought cost $50.00 and that was still considered special pricing; so buying it through Amazon and from this seller seemed like a real bargain. It is not a coincidence that other buyers who have bought this product before have the same complaint about the quality and questionable authenticity of the shampoo and\or conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was disappointing to see that even when you’re dealing with a 3rd party company you run the risk of getting ripped off.  I even tried to convince myself that perhaps the differences in the line had to do with the manufacturing plant – one plant versus the other.  Really??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now I’ll stick to the real thing and pay the extra $$ if I have to since all the other bargains posted in Amazon seem like too good to be true.</li>
    <li> best shampoo and conditioner for damaged hair</li>
    <li> Whatever company I ordered from this last time did not give me real Schwarzkopf.. I have been using it for over a year so I know what it looks and smells like.  Whatever I got is not the real thing - it smells awful and the color of the shampoo is not the same.  I have never had it have Spanish on the bottle either and this one has it.  Whoever is selling this is not selling the real thing unless the formulation has completely changed.</li>
    <li> I found the product very good. I recommend. My hair was wonderful. Super soft and shiny. Still very fragrant. Nominate.</li>
    <li> It is ok for smooth your hair and clean it up. But for the repair part, I do not think it really works. Anyway it just as ordinary as other shampoo except for personal preferences I do not like the smell.</li>
    <li> and order came fast, and they last a long time - there is 4 of us that use it and last 2 months</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for two years now and I love it.  Smells great, makes my hair very soft.</li>
    <li> excellent price.  quick delivery. provided pumps and nicely packaged</li>
    <li> I think this is a fake shampoo. I used to use this a few years back and loved it. This particular one makes my hair look and feel dirty. In the dumpster it goes!</li>
    <li> Made my hair really oily, smelled great but was not worth it at all.</li>
    <li> Ok so I love this product! BUT I got color care instead of repair rescue?! It clearly says repair rescue on my order form too! Very disappointed with the mix up! But I still love this product!</li>
    <li> I have previously purchased this product from my salon and absolutely loved it. I had some product remaining, so I was able to compare the two side by side. It did not smell the same, have the same texture, lather the same, or have the same results on my hair. The product that I received through my purchase at amazon.com was undoubtedly counterfeit. Supremely disappointed in my purchase.</li>
    <li> The shampo and conditioner is Repair Rescue and send me save color.... very bad&lt;br /&gt;I need my reposition the my money or send me the correct product but I live in Ecuador</li>
    <li> This was well worth buying, I received these bottles in a cute tote bag along with the option of pumps. The shampoo is highly concentrated so you only need a quarter size in on your hand for lathering, and same as the conditioner. However I like to use a little more conditioner due to my hair being dry. After just one use my hair feels full and I just let it air dry, and it&#x27;s perfect! It&#x27;s light and you can see the difference with first time use. I&#x27;m a loyal customer now</li>
    <li> was exactly what i ordered</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner seem great.  It arrived without any damages in the packaging however it was missing the dispensers for one of the bottle and even the one that arrived is stuck and for some reason won&#x27;t work. Without the dispensers it does get a bit tricky using this product unless you transfer into other containers. Taking off one star for the discomfort :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/14 Almost 3-4 months into using this product, I have started to feel the quality of both the products is not that great. It seems different from the previously store brought products I had used. the conditioner seems more thinner and does absolutely nothing for my hair. I&#x27;m starting to think this product is counterfeit. Taking 3 more stars off for that.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo and conditioner. It makes my hair soft and doesn&#x27;t make it dry and OMG!!! I love the smell of it :)</li>
    <li> I paid this amount at a salon for the smaller size. What a great deal this was. I will buy hear from now on.</li>
    <li> What I received was not the actual product.  Not only is the packaging different but there is an underlying smell that is not of the original product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes my hair feel better than any shampoo I have ever used. And it helps my hair from tangling.</li>
    <li> Just too much stuff, hard to handle.  I had to get dispensers and it was still way too thick for usage.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses this on my hair and I love it. Priced it at Ulta and wayyyy to expensive there so I ordered on here. I know some said they got a bootleg bottle, but mine are the same smell and consistency as the one in the salon.</li>
    <li> The product is good but 1 of the pumps was broken beyond repair.</li>
