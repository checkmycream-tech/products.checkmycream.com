      <li>i received my mother&#x27;s special blend skin toning oil today.i hope it minimize my stretch marks.most of the reviews talks good about it</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>This product is fabulous!</li>
      <li>it has helped alot with the itching problem and although i still have many marks on my belly</li>
      <li>It smells more like chocolate than anything (must be the cocoa butter)</li>
      <li>so i will be placing an order for sure  &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t leave it up to fate.</li>
      <li>--I was 21-- for the quick weight loss, but this FOR SURE deserves credit for my skin!).</li>
      <li>It smells pretty good, lighy coconut oil scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells nice and absorbs fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>I have noticed one of my gray shirts becoming a bit darker where it covers my stomach though--</li>
      <li>I recommend it to every pregnant mother I know!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for most of my pregnancy and have yet to get any stretchmarks (where I applied it in time--started at the end of the first trimester, so my advice is to begin applying it as soon as you can!).</li>
      <li>and it goes on light and smooth.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m at 20 weeks - with a huge tummy and still stretch mark free.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff so much!</li>
      <li>have used it with great results, and no stretch marks or stretched out skin!  </li>
      <li>I started using Mother&#x27;s Special Blend when put on steroid treatment in 2006.</li>
      <li>i think pure coconut oil works better</li>
      <li>The price was just right, and it WORKED!</li>
      <li>It absorbs into your skin really super nicely and it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, like the other cream I purchased kind of does.</li>
      <li>nothing truly does - but my belly skin was so much more supple that they were minimized and after my son was born they faded much quicker than any of my friends&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s when I started looking around for something more promising.</li>
      <li>Luckily, after some online research, I discovered Mother&#x27;s Special Blend.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I applied the oil as directed throughout the entire pregnancy because it felt so good on my itchy pregnant belly</li>
      <li>This is a great value compared to other products out there</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m already six months pregnant.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended this to EVERY pregnant person I know.  </li>
      <li>My massage therapist now uses this product for all her pregnant clients.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know pregnant women can get stretch marks on their thighs</li>
      <li>I have been using this product since I was about 3 months pregnant (am now about 5 months along).</li>
      <li>i highly recommend :)</li>
      <li>It soothes the itching really quick, but I&#x27;ve found that I now need a lot more than I used to, which I suppose is understandable as I have more surface area to cover and the little one is plumping up quickly :).  </li>
      <li>I was lucky enough not to get them everywhere, and decided that Palmers did a pretty good job at preventing them.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not perfumed, so it doesn&#x27;t smell all nice, thanks to my sensitive nose</li>
      <li>say this is totally worth a try.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pregnant first time now</li>
      <li>but i used to work at a dermatology office and one of the doctors i used to work for used this while she was pregnant and she highly recommended it!  </li>
      <li>I received this skin toning oil as a gift from a friend when I announced my first pregnancy.</li>
      <li>I am sure I will purchase a third time for after the baby.</li>
      <li>At first, I put it on once a day after my shower, and then twice a day or more once I got bigger.  </li>
      <li>I would totally buy this again and will be buying more if I have another baby.</li>
      <li>today is ma first time of using it.</li>
      <li>I was recommended by a friend who just had her first baby.</li>
      <li>My sister first used this in her pregnancy.  </li>
      <li>Whenever any of my friends find out they (or their wife/girlfriend) are expecting a baby, this is the FIRST thing I recommend.  </li>
      <li>So I used Palmers cocoa butter for my first pregnancy and got stretch marks on my butt and belly button.</li>
      <li>It also has not helped with the itching, but it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I love that this oil does not stain, however, I only use it at night under my tank tops that I wear to bed.</li>
      <li>or if this really works, but I won&#x27;t go through a pregnancy without it!</li>
      <li>With this pregnancy though, I started noticing that I was getting stretch marks higher up on my belly.</li>
      <li>I think avoiding stretch marks is largely hydrating your skin with the right type of moisturizer/oil.</li>
      <li>With that said, I would highly recommend any pregnant women to give this product a try.</li>
      <li>That being said, I still really like the product so far and it has a very mild scent (smells like hot cocoa).</li>
      <li>After I saw how AMAZING she looked after having a baby, I knew I would use the same thing when I got pregnant (which was about a year later).  </li>
      <li>After doing more research online I came cross it again and it was much cheaper, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
      <li>I have other stretch marks from puberty, so I am certain that using a great oil (and not gaining too much weight) are the key to preventing stretch</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll certainly buy another for myself when baby number 2 comes along (eventually).</li>
      <li>I am pregnant with my third child and instead of getting more stretch marks, the ones I currently have are disappearing!</li>
      <li>I was referred to this product by a friend who had recently been pregnant, she swore it helped stave off any stretch marks!  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
      <li>you are thinking of buying this, IHIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
      <li>and I am still stretch mark free, even after four big babies.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need too much either; I think I used 2 bottles for my whole pregnancy.</li>
      <li>I used it every morning and every night for the whole term of my pregnancy with my twins and didn&#x27;t get one stretch mark.  </li>
      <li>so i haven&#x27;t really grown that much</li>
      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>I used this the whole time and got no stretch marks.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I immediately switched back to the Mother&#x27;s Special Blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I never found anything that actually worked but Mothers Special Blend did help a lot with the itching.</li>
      <li>So far, I really love it (as a moisturizer and a reliever of itchy skin) and I do not have a single stretch mark.</li>
      <li>Just look at the ingredient list - you don&#x27;t need anything more or anything less.</li>
      <li>I would definitely suggest this to anyone who is pregnant.</li>
      <li>This product was recommended to me by a friend who, like me, was older when she had her kids.  </li>
      <li>I got a bottle as a gift when I was 3 months pregnant, and am still using the same bottle now at 5 months postpartum.</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m pregnant with my second child and have been using Palmers again....</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I started using Mother&#x27;s Special Blend when put on steroid treatment in 2006. Due to health conditions I tend to gain and lose weight often and I ALWAYS have a bottle of this oil by the tub! It works wonderfully and has a nice smell. It is not too greasy if you massage it into the skin. Helps me with that tight itchy skin feeling that comes along with a swollen belly. Also works on toning to prevent and lighten stretch marks. So would I buy it if I were you?? YES! Buy 2 because once you fall in love with this product you are hooked for life!!!</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing a set of three of these bottles. I am sure I will purchase a third time for after the baby.</li>
    <li> I got this stuff at whole foods actually on a whim  because I saw it there and was just browsing for prenatal vitamins to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brought this stuff home and had the hubbie rub my belly (make a wish!) with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally love the smell! It smells more like chocolate than anything (must be the cocoa butter) and it goes on light and smooth. It absorbs into your skin really super nicely and it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, like the other cream I purchased kind of does. It might rub off a little on your clothes, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to stain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, I&#x27;m 26 weeks and still don&#x27;t have any stretch marks (thank God on both accounts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say this is totally worth a try. Plus it is cruelty free!!</li>
    <li> I used this the whole time and got no stretch marks. It is amazing and everyone who is concerned with getting stretch marks needs to go out and purchase this. It works wonders. I have never been so happy with a product and can still wear a two piece and look great!]</li>
    <li> My acupuncturist who also owns a natural/whole food health store recommended this product early in my pregnancy. She used it herself (and got no stretch marks) and instructed me to use this every day after I showered and to continue using them for another 3 months after I deliver. I put it on ritually over my breasts, belly, and hips. I didn&#x27;t know pregnant women can get stretch marks on their thighs so I didn&#x27;t put the oil on them and that&#x27;s the only place I got stretch marks. I got those stretch marks during the last 3-4 weeks and I started to put on the oil immediately after I noticed them and continued for 3 months after my daughter was born and they eventually faded away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people claim that stretch marks in hereditary, but my case with the thighs is one example that defies this claim. I&#x27;m Korean but spent most of my life in a very dry high desert part of CA. My mother had her children in Korea where the climate is extremely  humid and skin stays very moist, and she did not get any stretch marks from any of her pregnancies. I think avoiding stretch marks is largely hydrating your skin with the right type of moisturizer/oil. With that said, I would highly recommend any pregnant women to give this product a try.</li>
    <li> I received this skin toning oil as a gift from a friend when I announced my first pregnancy. She swore by it, but I was skeptical. My mom got stretch marks and I figured I was doomed due to genetics. One of my close friends is a dermatologist who told me no topical product would prevent stretch marks (she told me only retin-a and/or laser treatments after the pregnancy would help). Anyway, I applied the oil as directed throughout the entire pregnancy because it felt so good on my itchy pregnant belly and I liked the scent. To my surprise, I did not develop ANY stretch marks despite having an almost 9 lb. baby (I am 5&#x27; 2&amp;#34; and a size zero). With my subsequent pregnancies, I started applying the oil the day of the positive pregnancy tests and I am still stretch mark free, even after four big babies. This is a great value compared to other products out there and I like that it is all natural. Now I am the one giving this out to pregnant friends, it really is a great product.  Edited to add: I&#x27;ve since had a set of twins, still not a single stretch mark. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I started using this pretty recently. I am pregnant with my third child and instead of getting more stretch marks, the ones I currently have are disappearing! I have tried several different things to get rid of my previous pregnancy stretch marks, but nothing really worked. With this pregnancy though, I started noticing that I was getting stretch marks higher up on my belly. I asked my midwife if she recommended anything for the stretch marks, and she told me about this product. Within the first two days of using this oil, the little stretch marks that I had begun developing were gone, and within the first week, my old stretch marks were starting to disappear. I am putting it on twice a day. I have to say that I&#x27;ve never met this products match! I will definitely keep buying it, if not for me, than for a friend!</li>
    <li> So I used Palmers cocoa butter for my first pregnancy and got stretch marks on my butt and belly button. I was lucky enough not to get them everywhere, and decided that Palmers did a pretty good job at preventing them. Now I&#x27;m pregnant with my second child and have been using Palmers again....big mistake! The stretch marks that I got prior just got worse and started to grow. That&#x27;s when I started looking around for something more promising. I spotted this product in my local heath food store but was hesitant to purchase it. After doing more research online I came cross it again and it was much cheaper, so I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m very glad I did, although I already have existing stretch marks, this product has minimized their appearance. It has a bit of an odd smell due to to cocoa and almond oil, but it is not strong, and I love that it&#x27;s all natural! The only problem I came across is that it soaked into my shirt more than my skin, so I have to expose my belly for a half hour or so my skin absorbs it. It also has not helped with the itching, but it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. I wish I could have found this product much earlier since I just started using it and I&#x27;m already six months pregnant. I will use this for the remaining months of my pregnancy and afterwards as well.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff so much! I used it throughout my pregnancy and it helped with the itching and I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks! I have other stretch marks from puberty, so I am certain that using a great oil (and not gaining too much weight) are the key to preventing stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice and absorbs fairly quickly. You don&#x27;t need too much either; I think I used 2 bottles for my whole pregnancy. Now I use it out of the shower to prevent dry skin. I would totally buy this again and will be buying more if I have another baby.</li>
    <li> tried and tested with my 2 pregnancies. No stretch marks. With my first pregnancy, when I got to my 5th month, my belly started to itch like crazy. I literally had red streaks from the scratch marks. I did not want to splurge $70 on those balms...tried Palmer&#x27;s but those did not help with the itching. Luckily, after some online research, I discovered Mother&#x27;s Special Blend. The price was just right, and it WORKED! I used twice daily, all the way through pregnancy and a few months after. I recommend it to every pregnant mother I know!</li>
    <li> My son is now 6 months but when I was pregnant I probably spent over $200 dollars on creams, oils, and lotions to prevent stretchmarks. I never found anything that actually worked but Mothers Special Blend did help a lot with the itching. It smells pretty good, lighy coconut oil scent. I really didn&#x27;t enjoy that its greasy so wait a few min before putting on a shirt. Other than that like I said it did help a lot with the itching but didnt prevent any stretchmarks from coming out.</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous! I got a bottle as a gift when I was 3 months pregnant, and am still using the same bottle now at 5 months postpartum. I didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark on my belly during my pregnancy, and have continued to use the product on my c-section scar. It&#x27;s not too greasy, has a nice smell, and delivers results. I send all of my girlfriends a bottle when they announce thier pregnancies. I&#x27;ll certainly buy another for myself when baby number 2 comes along (eventually).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for most of my pregnancy and have yet to get any stretchmarks (where I applied it in time--started at the end of the first trimester, so my advice is to begin applying it as soon as you can!). It soothes the itching really quick, but I&#x27;ve found that I now need a lot more than I used to, which I suppose is understandable as I have more surface area to cover and the little one is plumping up quickly :).  I have noticed one of my gray shirts becoming a bit darker where it covers my stomach though--granted, I put a lot (and I mean -a lot-) of oil on whenever I feel the slightest itch, so that&#x27;s probably why, and it&#x27;s a small price to pay to keep stretchmarks at bay. Other than that, I haven&#x27;t found any stains on my clothes or sheets.  I would definitely suggest this to anyone who is pregnant.</li>
    <li> i received my mother&#x27;s special blend skin toning oil today.i hope it minimize my stretch marks.most of the reviews talks good about it so am hoping for something good....i will give it 3 stars cos today is ma first time of using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since I was about 3 months pregnant (am now about 5 months along). I use this product once in the morning after I shower, and then again at night. So far, I really love it (as a moisturizer and a reliever of itchy skin) and I do not have a single stretch mark. Granted, I am still in my 2nd trimester and stretch marks may be completely unavoidable due to genetics and science, but so far this product has me believing that so far, so good.</li>
    <li> For this product, the description of ingredients on Amazon included: Almond Oil, Coconut Oil, Pecan Oil, Cocoa Butter and Vitamin E.  But on the product itself, there is no Pecan Oil listed.  That being said, I still really like the product so far and it has a very mild scent (smells like hot cocoa). I still think it&#x27;s important to correct the ingredients listed since consumers look for specific oils for different healhcare properties.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for both of my pregnancys with what I think are wonderful results. I actually bought a bottle this time for an expectant friend. I recomend this product to all expectant woman.</li>
    <li> The Oil smelled so nice. Almost like chocolate. Very moisturizing. I use it after the shower for allday moisture. Great product.</li>
    <li> I was referred to this product by a friend who had recently been pregnant, she swore it helped stave off any stretch marks!  With the incredible itchiness of my belly during my pregnancy, I knew I needed something, and this product works perfectly! I put it on after a shower when my skin is warm/damp and while it does take a while to sink in, I don&#x27;t mind walking around with my belly out!  From what I&#x27;ve seen so far it doesn&#x27;t stain your shirts (since it is an oil, after all). The smell is neither strong or bad, its kind of a subtle chocolatey smell.  I really like it and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend who, like me, was older when she had her kids.  She couldn&#x27;t say enough about how well it pampered her skin.  Granted, it does not prevent stretch marks - nothing truly does - but my belly skin was so much more supple that they were minimized and after my son was born they faded much quicker than any of my friends&#x27;.  My massage therapist now uses this product for all her pregnant clients.</li>
    <li> I was recommended by a friend who just had her first baby. She has a history of stretch marks (she already has some on her thighs and butt. She used this product on her tummy and got NO STRETCH marks!! I&#x27;m pregnant first time now and I&#x27;m at 20 weeks - with a huge tummy and still stretch mark free. Just look at the ingredient list - you don&#x27;t need anything more or anything less. It&#x27;s not perfumed, so it doesn&#x27;t smell all nice, thanks to my sensitive nose it turned me off a bit (this is a pregnancy symptom and you may not notice it!) but I still slather it on because it&#x27;s all good stuff. Then I use my regular lotion for arms and legs. I&#x27;d bathe in it if I could.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil about 3months ago and i still got stretch marks. I noticed them in my inner arms and now that im 7mo. im noticing some on my upper stomach.. Maybe the product just not for me</li>
    <li> I am only 4 months pregnant but i used to work at a dermatology office and one of the doctors i used to work for used this while she was pregnant and she highly recommended it!  She swore by it- so i haven&#x27;t really grown that much but the product came much sooner than i expected- within a few business days.  I would definitly order from this company again.  i will be needing a new bottle soon anyways so i will be placing an order for sure  &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> it has helped alot with the itching problem and although i still have many marks on my belly i feel it made the redness leave faster. I put it on after the shower and it feel so good!! i highly recommend :)</li>
    <li> I used this religiously since mid-2nd trimester. I gained 45 lbs total. I had a C-section. When a nurse was examining my stitches, the 1st thing she said when she saw my stomach, \\&quot;Wow! No stretchmarks!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! I began using it at around 6 months, once daily after my shower before bed. The 8 oz bottle lasted all 3 months and I even had some left over to use after my daughter was born.A little goes a long way. I just know that I would have gotten a lot of stretch marks without this product due to my skin type. I had read that it is a myth that stretch marks can be prevented, you either get them or you don&#x27;t. But I was not taking any chances and I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t leave it up to fate. Buy this stuff it works</li>
    <li> I used this every day during my 2 pregnancies (starting around 3 months), and I have never had a single stretch mark! I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s luck or if this really works, but I won&#x27;t go through a pregnancy without it! It also helps to soothe the itchy belly! I love it!</li>
    <li> Whenever any of my friends find out they (or their wife/girlfriend) are expecting a baby, this is the FIRST thing I recommend.  My sister first used this in her pregnancy.  She found it in some health-food store I think, and liked it because it is JUST oils, no chemicals or preservatives.  After I saw how AMAZING she looked after having a baby, I knew I would use the same thing when I got pregnant (which was about a year later).  I didn&#x27;t get not even one stretch mark, and my skin was sooo soft.  I was back in a bikini in 2 weeks (although I also credit breastfeeding, a very hungry baby, and my youth--I was 21-- for the quick weight loss, but this FOR SURE deserves credit for my skin!). Our mother got stretch marks with her pregnancies, so I think she was a little jealous that my sister and I didn&#x27;t, and wished they had this oil when she was pregnant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went through about 1 1/2 bottles during my pregnancy.  At first, I put it on once a day after my shower, and then twice a day or more once I got bigger.  I&#x27;d recommend putting it on and waiting a few minutes before getting dressed so the oil can sink in.  You can also use it after the baby is born, which I did only for a short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, when I was about seven months along, I decided to try some Palmers Belly Butter. The next day, my stomach starting itching and broke out in this rash.  I immediately switched back to the Mother&#x27;s Special Blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended this to EVERY pregnant person I know.  All of my friends (I can think of about 6, early to mid-twenties women) have used it with great results, and no stretch marks or stretched out skin!  One friend I recommended it to said she used it for only a little while and then stopped, and she has stretch marks and the typical stretched out belly-skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the bottle has a tendency to get oily on the outside no matter how carefully you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking of buying this, IHIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend it! If I could only buy ONE thing for myself during a pregnancy, this would be IT! You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> same as all natural oils i think pure coconut oil works better then this i saw no difference using this product</li>
    <li> I have used this with my last 2 pregnancies and have no stretch marks. Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of this oil, but I know it can&#x27;t hurt! I love that this oil does not stain, however, I only use it at night under my tank tops that I wear to bed. This oil does have a slight cocoa smell, but it&#x27;s not nauseating at all. I am easily turned off by strong odors, but it&#x27;s so faint that I don&#x27;t smell it for long. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is the best product to prevent stretch marks!!!  I used it every morning and every night for the whole term of my pregnancy with my twins and didn&#x27;t get one stretch mark.  Best product ever!!</li>
