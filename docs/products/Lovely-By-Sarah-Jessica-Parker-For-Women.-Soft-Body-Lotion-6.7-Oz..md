    <li> Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker is a wonderful clean fragrance and lasts all day.  I receive compliments everywhere I go and especially while standing in line at the grocery store or just shopping.  I do wish they made the shower gel in the 6.7 size it is so nice to be able to layer the fragrance.

Amazon, can you help us get this lotion back at a reasonable price???!!!</li>
    <li> I am constantly complimented on my \\&quot;perfume\\&quot;.  I find the lotion is just right in strength of scent. It is subtle, and leaves one wanting more.
