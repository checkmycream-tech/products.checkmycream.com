    <li> Received them very fast! I was wondering how well they would be made and was surprisingly satisfied.  They were the perfect size and made very well. My toddler is very hard on hair bows and barrettes because she rips them out and plays with them. These stay in very well and she wants them in! When she does have them out and has them in hand, she has not managed to ruin any of them yet. We have had them for several months now and no sign of them breaking or wearing down or not fastening.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very happy with them as well as my 3 year old!</li>
    <li> Great clips. Peppa size bigger than expected which is great! Received the clip within 1 week of ordering them which was amazing given that in the ordr it said it was going to take 4 weeks! Great seller and great product.</li>

    <li> My sweet little niece has super fine/thin hair (and not a whole lot of it) but these were actually perfect for her.  She LOVES Peppa and absolutely adored these. And they don&#x27;t pull so she was able to wear them for her birthday party. I would buy them again for her.</li>
