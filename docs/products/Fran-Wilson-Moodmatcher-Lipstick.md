      <li>I love this!!!!</li>
      <li>The color it turned out me be on my lips was a bright pinkish purple!</li>
      <li>The lipstick is great.</li>
      <li>I might like the bright purple lipstick.</li>
      <li>So glad I ordered the set to try it and see which I liked the best.</li>
      <li>But, the color turns out a bit too bright  on me.  </li>
      <li>It was pricey for just the one stick, but it was as good as I remembered.  </li>
      <li>I loved  </li>
      <li>I loved that</li>
      <li>We all love how it looks, so great product</li>
      <li>Love this lipstick!  </li>
      <li>After recieving it and trying it on, I love the way it looks!</li>
      <li>Even my dental hygienist wanted to know what kind of lipstick I wear because it didn&#x27;t rub off.</li>
      <li>i saw it and liked it, that was why i decided to buy it .</li>
      <li>If you like bright, bold lipstick, this is for you...</li>
      <li>While I love purple lipstick</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for many years.  </li>
      <li>and i love</li>
      <li>this was many years ago</li>
      <li>My two best friends wore it too and it looks completely different on all three of us!</li>
      <li>I love it!It</li>
      <li>the product is soft, lasts all day and is not sticky which is very nice.</li>
      <li>It makes no sense but it so cool!</li>
      <li>It is such a beautiful color</li>
      <li>and it was a beautiful red</li>
      <li>It looks best after a long day but dislike it right when it is put on.  </li>
      <li>Now I hope to try on other lipsticks and see which one I like best on me because I really do want to like this product.</li>
      <li>It goes on very smooth and it smells better than regular lipstick!</li>
      <li>If I were younger and more adventurous</li>
      <li>So it came fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>The bright pink sheer color lasts for many hours without reapplying, though for best results I apply, wait a few minutes, blot with a sheet of tissue, then apply again.</li>
      <li>but it goes on bright pink</li>
      <li>the yellow and the pink are the best colors for me</li>
      <li>It is that the black lipstick turned a bright purple on me.</li>
      <li>I do not like that my lips are the first thing someone sees when I walk into a room.</li>
      <li>Almost a hot purple.</li>
      <li>and it really lasts all day!</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>Before I never heard of Mood lipstick and pretty much was ignorant about it all</li>
      <li>Some are lighter, some brighter some with a darker hue, some more purple, some more red, but all are pink.</li>
      <li>There should be a photo of the single lipstick and nothing more.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>This was a very deceiving listing.</li>
      <li>I got a whole set elsewhere.</li>
      <li>Came out very purple on me.</li>
      <li>down the road i will come back to buy  some  despite what happend.the product looks good to me.</li>
      <li>love the black lipstick</li>
      <li>Despite my disappointment at the unexpected color, I am very happy with how the product wears.  </li>
      <li>I bought the pink one a few years ago and I initially thought it was going to be a soft, natural looking pink tone on me that would be perfect and lovely looking.</li>
      <li>yet I gave it one star because it is no different than any other mood lipstick I own</li>
      <li>Somewhat drying, nice color (but not different from any other color-changing lipstick,) long-lasting.</li>
      <li>It is fun to take out a &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; lipstick in public and apply it like it&#x27;s just another balm.</li>
      <li>I bought This lipstick thinking it was going to be red from reading the reviews, but unfortunately it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s not separate from anything else</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure what Fran Wilson thinks purple is, but purple (which is maroon in the tube) comes out bright pink.</li>
      <li>so if anyone out there wants red like I do beware</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ll see how it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve tried nearly all the colours.</li>
      <li>This is NOT black lipstick.</li>
      <li>It goes on clear and turns hot pink.</li>
      <li>Not black mines came out maroon</li>
      <li>every other mood lipstick is basically the same color pink I&#x27;m really trying to look for a red lipstick I used to own a blue mood lipstick</li>
      <li>it was a hot pink color.</li>
      <li>the black lipstick turned a really bright dark pink and stained my lips for days</li>
      <li>The listing showed several individual tubes, each marked with their color.</li>

<li> it&#x27;s pink just like</li>

<li> every other color turns out pink</li>
<li> The color looked more purple/darker in some images I saw; for me, it was very similar to the color from those green color-changing lipsticks, albeit a little darker because the base some black to it.</li>

<li> I ordered this in black</li>

<li> My lips started to heal when I stopped using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I was sad because I really liked the color but not worth having dry lips :-( .</li>

    <li> This lipstick isn&#x27;t even black. Don&#x27;t buy it. It spreads in like crayon.</li>
    <li> I recvd this on Wed. I put it on at about 7pm, I washed my face several times and its still a hint of it there and it is now 4 pm on Thurs.  This is better than those expensive stay put or so call long lasting lipsticks.  The color is so pretty its like a dark pink on me.  I love this!!!!</li>
    <li> It arrived loose in a box, turned up all the way, broken at the base and smashed into the lid.&lt;br /&gt;And just a warning....This is NOT black lipstick. It changes color to grandma pink after you apply it.</li>
    <li> i thought it was a set and it was just one</li>
    <li> I got this for christmas from my mom and i love it!I got the black lipstick, at first I was scared to try this because I already have too many black lipsticks, but when i tried it it turned like a bloody type red. I love it!It looks amazing!And this item arrived the 24th and she ordered it the 22nd. So it came fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> i saw it and liked it, that was why i decided to buy it . down the road i will come back to buy  some  despite what happend.the product looks good to me. thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what Fran Wilson thinks purple is, but purple (which is maroon in the tube) comes out bright pink. It&#x27;s not even close to being a purple hue. I have purple hair and wanted lips to match, but this is clearly pink. The lipstick is great. It doesn&#x27;t rub off and lasts a while. I like the lipstick, but not the colour. I&#x27;m going to try getting black cos I see that that one comes out purple. We&#x27;ll see how it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve tried nearly all the colours. They all come out in different shades of pink. Some are lighter, some brighter some with a darker hue, some more purple, some more red, but all are pink.</li>
    <li> I bought this without carefully looking atthe the description thinking it was actual black lipstick (which was what I wanted) but that was an error on my part. After recieving it and trying it on, I love the way it looks! My two best friends wore it too and it looks completely different on all three of us! It makes no sense but it so cool! We all love how it looks, so great product</li>
    <li> the black lipstick turned a really bright dark pink and stained my lips for days</li>
    <li> I thought the color of the lipstick was black, but it&#x27;s a mood lipstick. It goes on clear and turns hot pink.</li>
    <li> Not black mines came out maroon</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Thought it was black but the lipstick changed colors</li>
    <li> The listing showed several individual tubes, each marked with their color. Then it had this picture with multiple colors. It looked like it should be a variety or sampler pack. There was no disclaimer that the picture with multiple lipsticks really only contained one tube, and the one color I got wasn&#x27;t even one of the colors shown on the picture. This was a very deceiving listing. I will NEVER buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Years back I used the blue as my standard lipstick. Now 15 yrs later I ordered the set of 6- and surprise-the yellow and the pink are the best colors for me now- I never would have guessed!  So glad I ordered the set to try it and see which I liked the best.</li>
    <li> I bought the pink one a few years ago and I initially thought it was going to be a soft, natural looking pink tone on me that would be perfect and lovely looking. WRONG. I made the mistake of applying it while in the car at night while with my mom on our way for an errand. Then when we came back home I wanted to see how it looked on me in the bathroom mirror and to my horror it was a hot pink color. Now it&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t like pink in general it was just a let down for me as I did get my hopes up and got the opposite of what I expected. Before I never heard of Mood lipstick and pretty much was ignorant about it all but now I do know and will approach with prior knowledge. Now I hope to try on other lipsticks and see which one I like best on me because I really do want to like this product. Oh it did last long by the way and was moisturizing. Had to wash it off my lips with a wash cloth. Props to the product anyways. ;)</li>
    <li> Somewhat drying, nice color (but not different from any other color-changing lipstick,) long-lasting. Applies and feels similar to balm stain/chubby stick type lip colors. The bright pink sheer color lasts for many hours without reapplying, though for best results I apply, wait a few minutes, blot with a sheet of tissue, then apply again. The finish is slightly glossy at first, and once the glossiness is gone the color lasts as a stain for quite a while (8+ hours) and likely longer if you apply some balm and are careful about eating/drinking. The color looked more purple/darker in some images I saw; for me, it was very similar to the color from those green color-changing lipsticks, albeit a little darker because the base some black to it. It is fun to take out a &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; lipstick in public and apply it like it&#x27;s just another balm. The color develops over about 10 minutes after applying.</li>
    <li> It was pricey for just the one stick, but it was as good as I remembered.  I got a whole set elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This lipstick is great for a base lipstick that will stay on for hours. I have used this for years.</li>
    <li> I loved  the color thank you 😁</li>
    <li> I bought This lipstick thinking it was going to be red from reading the reviews, but unfortunately it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s not separate from anything else it&#x27;s pink just like every other color turns out pink every other mood lipstick is basically the same color pink I&#x27;m really trying to look for a red lipstick I used to own a blue mood lipstick and it was a beautiful red this was many years ago and I haven&#x27;t located one that is quite the same yet I gave it one star because it is no different than any other mood lipstick I own I ordered this in black so if anyone out there wants red like I do beware this is not a red color</li>
    <li> It is not that it is not good lipstick. It is that the black lipstick turned a bright purple on me. While I love purple lipstick I do not like that my lips are the first thing someone sees when I walk into a room. And that is the thing about buying this type of lipstick online. There is no way you can test out the product. There is no way to tell what the product will look like with your chemical makeup. If I were younger and more adventurous I might like the bright purple lipstick. If you are a bit crazy with your makeup and you like to shock people just a bit you might want to try this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered &amp;#34;black&amp;#34;, and the product looks black.  However, when I put it on, it was pink.  I understand that the shade is supposed to change according to the users body chemistry.  But I expected it to at least be a shade of black.  Despite my disappointment at the unexpected color, I am very happy with how the product wears.  Once it&#x27;s dry it stays on so well it&#x27;s almost difficult to wash off.</li>
    <li> Love this lipstick!  I&#x27;ve been using it for many years.  I use it as a base, then layer it so it lasts all day!  Even my dental hygienist wanted to know what kind of lipstick I wear because it didn&#x27;t rub off.</li>
    <li> Wanted the color to be black but it goes on bright pink&lt;br /&gt;Pretty color thought...</li>
    <li> Made my lips dry and chapped. My lips started to heal when I stopped using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I was sad because I really liked the color but not worth having dry lips :-( .</li>
    <li> Although I like this product, I have ordered this elsewhere and received the entire set of lipsticks. I feel that the Amazon photo is very misleading, and was disappointed. There should be a photo of the single lipstick and nothing more.</li>
    <li> The color it turned out me be on my lips was a bright pinkish purple! It is such a beautiful color and it really lasts all day! It goes on very smooth and it smells better than regular lipstick!</li>
    <li> Felt like I was back in the 80s again!!</li>
    <li> This lipstick has long lasting staying power.  I loved that and the fact that it left my lips moisturized.  But, the color turns out a bit too bright  on me.  It looks best after a long day but dislike it right when it is put on.  If you like bright, bold lipstick, this is for you...</li>
    <li> I purchased the black and it wasn&#x27;t even black. Keep in mind that the lips you see are the color of the lipstick. I didn&#x27;t pay attention to that before.</li>
    <li> The color is just a bit different from the rest of the Fran Wilson&#x27;s lipsticks but I like it</li>
    <li> Came out very purple on me. Almost a hot purple. Not a huge fan of the shade but the product is soft, lasts all day and is not sticky which is very nice.</li>
    <li> love the black lipstick</li>
