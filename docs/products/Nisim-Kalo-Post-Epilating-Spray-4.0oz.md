### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and i see nothing permanent for sure!!!!!</li>
      <li>It works best on lighter hair areas.</li>
      <li>I am EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
      <li>the smell isnt very nice</li>
      <li>Good for the summer, use with moderation and as instructed.</li>
      <li>One thing you have to realize is that it works best when used right after the hair is removed from the root.  </li>
      <li>then I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s going to be a lot more effective for you.</li>
      <li>The strip will grip the hairs better (and it will stick to the powder on your skin, and not your skin itself)</li>
      <li>After a year of usage, I would say I lost about 15% of the hair, maybe slightly more in some parts.</li>
      <li>but you probably have to do so many treatments before it even does that.</li>
      <li>:)  EDIT2</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m necessarily ok with losing.      </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years</li>
      <li>This Kalo Spray more quickly covers more surface area of the body&#x27;s skin than the lotion, but I like them both.</li>
      <li>Being a guy I grow a lot of hair very quickly.  </li>
      <li>thank you so much and have a nice day.</li>
      <li>I got an epilator which works great, but the hairs still grew back.  </li>
      <li>when I shaved my chin  then put the spray, or cream it didn&#x27;t work, then I pluck  hair with the roots and use the KALO spray, it is working, I am so excited.</li>
      <li>Originally I gave it 5 stars</li>
      <li>found it was most effective on coarse hair.</li>
      <li>and I find the liquid spray to be more effective for covering larger areas.  </li>
      <li>I was very pleased and am ordering a second bottle.  </li>
      <li>i need to get more lotion on my legs for more long than 3 days in a row.</li>
      <li>The great thing about it is that it&#x27;s not part of some other type of chemical hair removal system, which means I&#x27;m free to remove the hairs as I please (mainly via plucking).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Most people will requireabout 10-15 sessions to completely rid the hair.</li>
      <li>I am glad that it does not grow as fast or has much though.</li>
      <li>their website:  Kalo Spray is ideal for treating larger areas like legs or the back.</li>
      <li>Results were noticed within just a few weeks, but the longer it is used, the more effective you will see it to be.</li>
      <li>These two points are fairly counterproductive to each other.  </li>
      <li>If you grow hair more slowly or have more fine hair</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m so happy I can wait an extra few weeks between waxings and that eventually will be able to go much, much longer (could it really be true, that some day it will be truly gone...?).  </li>
      <li>Sounds pretty systemically disrupting to me.  </li>
      <li>I got this for $22, but now I see the price has jumped up to $37, which is around the amount I paid for it the first time I bought it 3 years ago.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re the same volume, but this bottle is shorter, fatter, and more rectangular in shape compared to my 1st bottle.</li>
      <li>To all the ladies and guys out there thinking about this you may not want to apply this just before a hot date.    </li>
      <li>And, being that it really is a lot more comfortable to wear cycling clothes with less hair</li>
      <li>Most people want quick results especially when spending a considerable amount of money.</li>
      <li>Being a cyclist I do do a certain amount of hair removal.  </li>
      <li>95% of the hairs have not grown back and the remaining hairs that grew back are fine and come out easily when tweezed.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable using it on such a large area of skin</li>
      <li>It was after a year that I really noticed reduced, slower hair regrowth.</li>
      <li>The smell is rather musky, but it&#x27;s a light musky smell that seems to dissipate after a short while.  </li>
      <li>I think that&#x27;s why it worked so fast for me.  </li>
      <li>This makes life sooooo much easier.</li>
      <li>I stopped using it after I contacted them to ask what their ingredients really are.  </li>
      <li>people (and the Kalo website) said they had to use it several times before noticing results; I noticed after the very first time that regrowth was 25%or more slower; the new hairs were smaller and finer and lighter in color.  </li>
      <li>After long term use this product has definitely been proven to be effective.</li>
      <li>I much prefer the cream (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RE8GYG?tag&#x3D;a52-20&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8) as it makes the skin extra soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>becasue you epilate the hair from th root, so it takes just a &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; time to grow back and this spray adds a &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; more time to grow back, i have been using this for over a year now</li>
      <li>I can, however, say for sure that it DOES NOT completely stop hair from growing back.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not too fond of the spray, though, as it&#x27;s a bit messy and slightly more costly than the Nisim Kalo cream.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Agree that the pump kind of sucks</li>
      <li>Definitely recommend using as described:  twice the first day, three times the next; sometimes I skipped the repeat applications and the regrowth was somewhat slowed but not as much as when I&#x27;d been more careful.  </li>
      <li>This product came quickly and I don&#x27;t have to use very much of it, so it will last a long time!</li>
      <li>I purchased Kalo direct and used Kalo correctly and faithfully for two years.</li>
      <li>Very embarrassing, since I&#x27;m a female.  </li>
      <li>The product is the same formula I remember, and works decently (but not miraculously).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve honestly just given up on the spray pump and started carefully pouring a small quantity into my hand and applying that way.  </li>
      <li>For me it does slow down regrowth, which is exactly what I wanted/needed, but doesn&#x27;t seem to do much more than that.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably the skin being sensitive from waxing, because the sensation disappears the next day.</li>
      <li>I think I barely noticed any change after using it for a month, but I figured since I bought it</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if the pump has been changed or not, but after pushing them experimentally they feel the same to me.  </li>
      <li>The product would probably be rated higher if the cost was less.  </li>
      <li>so it takes a long time to get rid of the hair, but it does work and is a whole lot cheaper than laser that takes many expensive treatments.  </li>
      <li>so i want to know about kalo lotion because i want to complete big one like 12oz than 2oz which not enough of lotion like three days.</li>
      <li>I purchased 2 bottles directly from Nisim, but it is more expensive than Amazon, so I decided to get my third bottle from Amazon.  </li>

<li> I wash my face prior to getting in the shower, lightly dry the area where I am going to put it.  </li>

<li> I figure after the third bottle I won&#x27;t need anymore, or maybe I&#x27;ll start focusing on other areas of my body.  </li>
<li> Let it dry for about a minute, put on my moisturizer and then hop in the shower.  </li>
<li> ......Which you wont and even then it will only have very little of a effect maybe make it might grow back alittle slower</li>
<li> Anyway, I finished my second bottle and have very little hair on my upper lip, chin and cheeks.  </li>
<li> I typically apply this after shaving for several days in a row.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t find the spray messy to apply, but the lotion is much easier to apply and less messy.</li>
<li> And, it only slows it for a few days for me.  </li>
<li> I am a forgetful person</li>
<li> I saw absolutely no improvement.</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re careful to keep it upright when you spray it, it works</li>
<li> (Don&#x27;t get your face wet in the shower).  </li>
<li> I have always had heavy facial hair since I was a teenager.  </li>
<li> It can be a little sticky and dry your skin by the next day, using a little lotion will help</li>
<li> I push the pump really hard when the bottle&#x27;s sitting upright on a table, and I can barely get any of the product out.</li>
<li> I think the photo here is for a larger bottle I purchased in the past.</li>
<li> nothing can get rid of body hair other than electrolysis works on hairs one by one.</li>
<li> and I just wanted this for my legs, so like the other reviewer, when the pump isn&#x27;t priming I pour it into my hands and apply that way.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s been about a year since I bought this bottle and the pump is pretty much useless.</li>
<li> Its crazy that in this day and age there still isnt anything out there that can get rid of body hair permanently and quickly.</li>
<li> If you use cold wax strips (they hurt less and are usually less messy than hot waxes), sometimes the adhesive side can grab your skin instead of hair, so you have to use multiple strips on one patch of hair.</li>
<li> This product is not worth the $42.00 I paid for it.  </li>
<li> it slows the growth down for1</li>
<li> What I&#x27;ve found is that Kalo dramatically slows down hair regrowth for me.  </li>
<li> hairier areas of my body grow slower after plucking the hair or shaving due to using this product!</li>
<li> and I have noticed a slight slowing of hair growth on my chin area.</li>
<li> I had high expectations of this product because it&#x27;s sooo ridiculously expensive</li>
<li> It does however slow hair growth down and makes the hair grow back less thickly.</li>
<li> that whenever I spray Kalo inhibitor on my armpits and legs, they would tingle, itch, or sting a little.</li>
<li> Tried hair removal creams, but they were too harsh for my skin.  </li>
<li> After repeated usage for a month on a small chin area, I am disappointed to see that same hair is still growing back.  </li>
<li> but the lotion is for small areas</li>
<li> Once it loses its priming</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought my 1st bottle 3 years ago from a different site and I still have some left. I just ordered my 2nd bottle today.  I don&#x27;t find the spray messy to apply, but the lotion is much easier to apply and less messy. I find the spray doesn&#x27;t smell as stinky as the lotion does though. But the stupid, crappy pump on the spray means I will only use the lotion from now on.  I can, however, say for sure that it DOES NOT completely stop hair from growing back. It does however slow hair growth down and makes the hair grow back less thickly. I think I barely noticed any change after using it for a month, but I figured since I bought it I might as well keep using it. It was after a year that I really noticed reduced, slower hair regrowth. I generally only need 2-3 weeks between waxing sessions, but when I forget to Kalo, I notice hair regrowth within a week and therefore need to wax then.  I&#x27;ve noticed (it&#x27;s a tad annoying) that whenever I spray Kalo inhibitor on my armpits and legs, they would tingle, itch, or sting a little. It&#x27;s probably the skin being sensitive from waxing, because the sensation disappears the next day. The lotion does not have this issue.  EDIT: Just received my 2nd bottle in the mail today. They&#x27;re the same volume, but this bottle is shorter, fatter, and more rectangular in shape compared to my 1st bottle. I got this for $22, but now I see the price has jumped up to $37, which is around the amount I paid for it the first time I bought it 3 years ago. I don&#x27;t know if the pump has been changed or not, but after pushing them experimentally they feel the same to me.  WAXING TIP: If you use cold wax strips (they hurt less and are usually less messy than hot waxes), sometimes the adhesive side can grab your skin instead of hair, so you have to use multiple strips on one patch of hair. Rub talcum powder or baby powder on the area with hair. The strip will grip the hairs better (and it will stick to the powder on your skin, and not your skin itself) so you useless strips and save yourself from more pain. :)  EDIT2: Dropped my review by 1 star. It&#x27;s been about a year since I bought this bottle and the pump is pretty much useless. I push the pump really hard when the bottle&#x27;s sitting upright on a table, and I can barely get any of the product out. Super disappointed. :(</li>
    <li> After long term use this product has definitely been proven to be effective. Results were noticed within just a few weeks, but the longer it is used, the more effective you will see it to be. The great thing about it is that it&#x27;s not part of some other type of chemical hair removal system, which means I&#x27;m free to remove the hairs as I please (mainly via plucking).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not too fond of the spray, though, as it&#x27;s a bit messy and slightly more costly than the Nisim Kalo cream. I much prefer the cream (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RE8GYG?tag&#x3D;a52-20&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8) as it makes the skin extra soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I purchased Kalo direct and used Kalo correctly and faithfully for two years. They said it &#x27;takes time.&#x27; I saw absolutely no improvement. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This makes life sooooo much easier. Why didnt I think about this sooner. Every womans dream. Just follow the instructions and sit back. recomend for all</li>
    <li> Being a cyclist I do do a certain amount of hair removal.  Being a guy I grow a lot of hair very quickly.  These two points are fairly counterproductive to each other.  And, being that it really is a lot more comfortable to wear cycling clothes with less hair it&#x27;s not a battle I&#x27;m necessarily ok with losing.      What I&#x27;ve found is that Kalo dramatically slows down hair regrowth for me.  I typically apply this after shaving for several days in a row.  Where I used to have leg stubble by later the same day I now can go several days before needing to dare the razor again.    I&#x27;ve tried the lotion and the liquid spray and I find the liquid spray to be more effective for covering larger areas.  The smell is rather musky, but it&#x27;s a light musky smell that seems to dissipate after a short while.  To all the ladies and guys out there thinking about this you may not want to apply this just before a hot date.    The one thing I do not like about this product is the spray pump.  It quite honestly is a very poor pump.  Once it loses its priming it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get it to function correctly again.  And, this has been the case for me for several bottles now.  I&#x27;ve honestly just given up on the spray pump and started carefully pouring a small quantity into my hand and applying that way.  It still covers well, and I&#x27;m much less frustrated.    As with any hair product results are going to vary for different people.  For me it does slow down regrowth, which is exactly what I wanted/needed, but doesn&#x27;t seem to do much more than that.  And, it only slows it for a few days for me.  If you grow hair more slowly or have more fine hair then I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s going to be a lot more effective for you.</li>
    <li> After repeated usage for a month on a small chin area, I am disappointed to see that same hair is still growing back.  It is still course.  This product is not worth the $42.00 I paid for it.  I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The product is the same formula I remember, and works decently (but not miraculously). The bottle was smaller than I expected, though. I think the photo here is for a larger bottle I purchased in the past.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 bottles directly from Nisim, but it is more expensive than Amazon, so I decided to get my third bottle from Amazon.  I use it on my upper lip, cheeks and chin.  I have always had heavy facial hair since I was a teenager.  Very embarrassing, since I&#x27;m a female.  I shaved and it looked horrible once the hairs started growing back.  Tried hair removal creams, but they were too harsh for my skin.  Then I started waxing (such a nuisance). I got an epilator which works great, but the hairs still grew back.  I searched on line for a hair growth inhibitor and saw Kalo so I decided to give it a try.  It does work, I noticed a difference in about 6 weeks.  One thing you have to realize is that it works best when used right after the hair is removed from the root.  You should also give it time because there are hairs already growing under the skin that will have to be removed once it breaks through the skin.  Anyway, I finished my second bottle and have very little hair on my upper lip, chin and cheeks.  I figure after the third bottle I won&#x27;t need anymore, or maybe I&#x27;ll start focusing on other areas of my body.  This is how I use it.  I wash my face prior to getting in the shower, lightly dry the area where I am going to put it.  Spray it on the mustache area, below my lower lip, on my chin and cheeks.  Let it dry for about a minute, put on my moisturizer and then hop in the shower.  I let the steam from the shower open my pores so the Kalo and moisturizer can absorb into my skin.  (Don&#x27;t get your face wet in the shower).  This was my nightly routine whether or not I removed hair.  I think that&#x27;s why it worked so fast for me.  95% of the hairs have not grown back and the remaining hairs that grew back are fine and come out easily when tweezed. I am EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT.  I&#x27;ve used it for about 7 months now, so time and patience is the key.</li>
    <li> This product came quickly and I don&#x27;t have to use very much of it, so it will last a long time!</li>
    <li> used this after waxing and had a very painful experience. It smells like garbage but that&#x27;s not the problem. Had massive breakouts, red bumps and rash all over my skin after using this. never recommend it to anybody!! just awful awful worst product ever used!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years so it takes a long time to get rid of the hair, but it does work and is a whole lot cheaper than laser that takes many expensive treatments.  It works best on lighter hair areas.</li>
    <li> when I shaved my chin  then put the spray, or cream it didn&#x27;t work, then I pluck  hair with the roots and use the KALO spray, it is working, I am so excited.</li>
    <li> Originally I gave it 5 stars but I&#x27;ve edited myself.  I stopped using it after I contacted them to ask what their ingredients really are.  Sugar doesn&#x27;t make your hair stop growing.  They agreed that they didn&#x27;t fully disclose their ingredients on the label.  It&#x27;s some enzyme that interrupts sulfur metabolism.  Sounds pretty systemically disrupting to me.  I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable using it on such a large area of skin (so permeable to chemicals!), and they refused to answer my questions.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, all the hair that stopped growing during use, grew back when I stopped.&lt;br /&gt;Back to shaving  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people (and the Kalo website) said they had to use it several times before noticing results; I noticed after the very first time that regrowth was 25%or more slower; the new hairs were smaller and finer and lighter in color.  I was very pleased and am ordering a second bottle.  This will be a slow process but I&#x27;m so happy I can wait an extra few weeks between waxings and that eventually will be able to go much, much longer (could it really be true, that some day it will be truly gone...?).  Definitely recommend using as described:  twice the first day, three times the next; sometimes I skipped the repeat applications and the regrowth was somewhat slowed but not as much as when I&#x27;d been more careful.  I did get big red bumps last time I used it but they disappeared by the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agree that the pump kind of sucks but the lotion is for small areas and I just wanted this for my legs, so like the other reviewer, when the pump isn&#x27;t priming I pour it into my hands and apply that way.  If you&#x27;re careful to keep it upright when you spray it, it works OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From their website:  Kalo Spray is ideal for treating larger areas like legs or the back. Kalo will prevent about 10% of the hair from growing back when used after the hair has been removed by the root.  You should notice results after about 2-3 hair removal sessions.  Most people will requireabout 10-15 sessions to completely rid the hair.</li>
    <li> Been using the product for about 2 weeks and I have noticed a slight slowing of hair growth on my chin area. But, the hair still grows. I am glad that it does not grow as fast or has much though.</li>
    <li> This products does work but very slowly!  I have used it for over 1 year now.  I must say I have not always followed instructions 100%. You are supposed to spray on after waxing 3 times that day and 3 times the next.  I am a forgetful person so i found that inconvenient; if i didn&#x27;t leave the bottle out, i would sometimes forget to reapply the next day. You also have to wait until it dries so 3 times in one day is kinda annoying- the smell isnt very nice either (kinda smells like sweat almost, its weird).&lt;br /&gt;I found it was most effective on coarse hair. After a year of usage, I would say I lost about 15% of the hair, maybe slightly more in some parts. During that time, I have used just over 3 bottles. The product would probably be rated higher if the cost was less.  Most people want quick results especially when spending a considerable amount of money. If this is you, it may not be the product for you.</li>
    <li> ......Which you wont and even then it will only have very little of a effect maybe make it might grow back alittle slower but you probably have to do so many treatments before it even does that. This will not get rid of your body hair nothing can get rid of body hair other than electrolysis works on hairs one by one. Its crazy that in this day and age there still isnt anything out there that can get rid of body hair permanently and quickly.</li>
    <li> I gave it a year...doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL. Waste of money!!!! I had high expectations of this product because it&#x27;s sooo ridiculously expensive and I am extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> hi everyone, I&#x27;m samia from Los Angeles, CA. so i want to know about kalo lotion because i want to complete big one like 12oz than 2oz which not enough of lotion like three days. i need to get more lotion on my legs for more long than 3 days in a row. So will i should get another lotion for a second of kalo lotion to purchase it? please let me know and leave a comment to reply me back thank you so much and have a nice day. - Samia</li>
    <li> it slows the growth down for1 becasue you epilate the hair from th root, so it takes just a &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; time to grow back and this spray adds a &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; more time to grow back, i have been using this for over a year now and i see nothing permanent for sure!!!!!</li>
    <li> Good for the summer, use with moderation and as instructed. It can be a little sticky and dry your skin by the next day, using a little lotion will help</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews before I decided to buy this, but dont bother it doesnt work at all, I have been using for a year now, following all the instructions and havent noticed any diference.</li>
    <li> This Kalo Spray more quickly covers more surface area of the body&#x27;s skin than the lotion, but I like them both.,&lt;br /&gt;My hairier areas of my body grow slower after plucking the hair or shaving due to using this product!</li>
