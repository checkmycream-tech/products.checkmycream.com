      <li>I love this hot comb.</li>
      <li>So far  I am very pleased with this model.  </li>
      <li>Use caution of course, and make sure you have a developed technique to twist hair as you run it through for better straitening.</li>
      <li>I love this hot comb for quick maintenance between visits to my hairdresser.</li>
      <li>And personally, I think the good reviews are a scam.</li>
      <li>The heat controls are true to the setting, so it gets very hot.  </li>
      <li>It heats up quickly and features temperature control and a built-in comb rest.</li>
      <li>She do like it for what it is: a quick fix with no worry of burning my hair or scalp.</li>
      <li>Heats quickly and it won&#x27;t fry my, which I&#x27;ve done before with a stove comb.</li>
      <li>It heats up quickly and you can increase or decrease the amount of heat needed for your hair.</li>
      <li>I greatly enjoy using this hot comb because of the ability to control the heat and it creates silkly shiny hair.</li>
      <li>Controls are easy, you can determine how much heat you need and save yourself breakage.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving 2 stars only because the 1st comb worked pretty good for me</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Just the right amount of heat for my hair.  </li>
      <li>And honestly, she could get the same or better results with the flat iron if she did smaller sections and more passes.</li>
      <li>, it was on the lowest setting when this malfunction happed, I never turned it up any higher.</li>
      <li>The design on this version has relocated the controls higher on the handle, so no accidental shut-offs.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t become all that hot.  </li>
      <li>I bought 2 of these combs, the 1st one worked out pretty well</li>
      <li>TOO HOT</li>
      <li>This was my first pressing comb purchase ever</li>
      <li>This works better for me than the flat iron, (Shorter hair).</li>
      <li>This hot comb works very well, the controls are placed in a way that let&#x27;s it stay hot.  </li>
      <li>My hair can only take the nearest to the lowest heat possible because of its natural &amp;#34;fragility&amp;#34; so this hot comb is just great.  </li>
      <li>Works better than I expected for this price.  </li>
      <li>and I really like the results.</li>
      <li>I use it every day and leaves my hair shiny and straight.</li>
      <li>The next day when I tried to use it, the indicator light came on but the comb never got any heat.</li>
      <li>Heats up fast...</li>
      <li>service was fast.</li>
      <li>Good for making thick, curly hair manageable.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this Andis Ultra High Heat Press Comb on Dec. 30, 2014.  </li>
      <li>the cord is more than long enough.</li>
      <li>My daughters love this tool because it works very well on their thick and curly hair.</li>
      <li>Not only does it heat up quickly, but it straightens much easier and faster than a flat iron.  </li>
      <li>It gets as hot as you could possibly need.</li>
      <li>I like that you can control the level of heat, and I have had no problem with it getting hot enough to do my hair without resorting to the highest heat setting.</li>
      <li>The controls are higher up on the handle so that when it is gripped you are not constantly shutting it off.  </li>
      <li>Comb does not get hot enough.</li>
      <li>I have been natural for 4 years.</li>
      <li>Then tried again several days later, still wouldn&#x27;t get hot.  </li>
      <li>My 2nd comb was defected, I used to use the 1st comb on a high heat number like 15 or 20, if I were pressing my entire hair from a fresh wash/ blow dry.</li>
      <li>Would suggest to anyone seeking to remove volume and maintain straight hair during minimal activity.</li>
      <li>I had the comb for a few months and had no problems until when I went to use it, it was so hot it actually started to burn my hair</li>

    <li> Fast Delivery, product just as described, very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Too heavy to work on my hair. Was a total waste of money. Wouldn&#x27;t have given it even one star, but it made me do so.</li>
    <li> My daughters love this tool because it works very well on their thick and curly hair.</li>
    <li> Thanks for a great item!</li>
    <li> Heats up fast... Straights my extras coily curly ... Really hot, so amazingly don&#x27;t need highest heat... It&#x27;s a true plus if u need it!</li>
    <li> great product works like it is supposed to and is well made.!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my mother, but she said it works for her even better than &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; combs that need to be heated on stove. She really liked being able to control the temperature.</li>
    <li> Works better than I expected for this price.  Satisfied.</li>
    <li> had to return.. no go for my hair. i have thick hair.just was not for me. service was fast.</li>
    <li> horrible - doesn&#x27;t work - &amp;#34;cooler&amp;#34; temperature does nothing to hair - warmer temperatures WAY TOO HOT - my daughter burned herself twice.</li>
    <li> This was my first pressing comb purchase ever and I have not been disappointed. I have grown to prefer this method of straightening on my daughters&#x27; hair versus a flat iron.  Not only does it heat up quickly, but it straightens much easier and faster than a flat iron.  It straightens with fewer passes compared to a flat iron in my experience and we don&#x27;t even turn it all the way up.  I only wish it had temperature settings versus numbered heating setting (1-20).</li>
    <li> Great for my afro hair m loving it</li>
    <li> i am not sure if I receive the real it. paint is already coming off.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t become all that hot.  Curling iron is better for the heat and they both govt 500 degrees.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully! Tempeture control is awesome.</li>
    <li> This one is perfect.  The controls are higher up on the handle so that when it is gripped you are not constantly shutting it off.  Make sure you purchase this model 38320. It gets as hot as you could possibly need. Love it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work.  I seem to be on a roll for purchasing broken items.</li>
    <li> She do like it for what it is: a quick fix with no worry of burning my hair or scalp. It heats up quickly and features temperature control and a built-in comb rest. It&#x27;s light (but not feather) weight and the cord is more than long enough. The price is fair as well. That being said, She didn&#x27;t get the silkiness of a press until she went over it with her flat iron. And honestly, she could get the same or better results with the flat iron if she did smaller sections and more passes. All things considered, this is a 3-star product for her.</li>
    <li> I read the complaints on the less expensive version of the Andis regarding the location of the heat control buttons and decided to try the professional one.  So far  I am very pleased with this model.  I hope that it last a long time.  Just the right amount of heat for my hair.  Thank you Andis.</li>
    <li> My goodness this thing works well. Use caution of course, and make sure you have a developed technique to twist hair as you run it through for better straitening. Controls are easy, you can determine how much heat you need and save yourself breakage. Heats fast, and is good quality construction.</li>
    <li> This laid my hair out beautifully. I mean, silky, soft, flowing, and straight. No burning or smoking either. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I am glad I bought this. I use it every day and leaves my hair shiny and straight.</li>
    <li> Great product works great on my gotee - very high quality product is maid very well - heats up fast dial heat control levels - I place my on a plate though so it docent burn my counter tops. Great price - fair shipping - fast delivery. Would recommend this vendor again will do business with them again.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these combs, the 1st one worked out pretty well but about 13 months later it just died out of nowhere so I bought another.... My 2nd comb was defected, I used to use the 1st comb on a high heat number like 15 or 20, if I were pressing my entire hair from a fresh wash/ blow dry. When I recieved the 2nd comb, my hair was already kinda straightened, so I put it on level 10 &amp; that stupid thing burned a patch of my hair out! (That was hotter than I ever remember the 1st comb being on the highest level) I turned it down but it never cooled down any, so I turned it off &amp; unplugged it. The next day when I tried to use it, the indicator light came on but the comb never got any heat. So I had to return it  :(&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m giving 2 stars only because the 1st comb worked pretty good for me</li>
    <li> I had the comb for a few months and had no problems until when I went to use it, it was so hot it actually started to burn my hair, it was on the lowest setting when this malfunction happed, I never turned it up any higher. Save yourself the trouble and don&#x27;t buy this product, it&#x27;s dangerous!!</li>
    <li> I greatly enjoy using this hot comb because of the ability to control the heat and it creates silkly shiny hair.</li>
    <li> Awesome good stuff relly does its job for my five year old daughter....</li>
    <li> This hot comb works very well, the controls are placed in a way that let&#x27;s it stay hot.  The heat controls are true to the setting, so it gets very hot.  I have been using it regularly and I really like the results.</li>
    <li> Loved the hot comb. This works better for me than the flat iron, (Shorter hair). Great for travel. Really happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Extremely fast to hear up and great for edges</li>
    <li> For my purposes - well designed, easy to use, and flexible heat settings.  I am very pleased with this heat comb.</li>
    <li> PIECE OF CRAP....I ordered this Andis Ultra High Heat Press Comb on Dec. 30, 2014.  I used it one time only and the second time I plugged it in ....it didn&#x27;t work.  It simply would NOT heat up....no heat at all.  I gave it the benefit of the doubt and let it rest and tried it again...nothing.  Then tried again several days later, still wouldn&#x27;t get hot.  On Jan. 14, 2015, I printed out my return label and will be sending it back the following day. Don&#x27;t waste your money. And personally, I think the good reviews are a scam.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works well on my thick hair. Heats quickly and it won&#x27;t fry my, which I&#x27;ve done before with a stove comb. Not so great for a full head press but great for edges.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my hair, just the right amount of heat. I was a little hesitant ordering the comb, but I decided to stop using chemicals in my hair so I decided to give it a try. It heats up quickly and you can increase or decrease the amount of heat needed for your hair. My hair is quite thick and  the  heat press comb does the job and gives my hair the look I got from using chemicals. This  brings back memories of my mom straightening my hair when I was a little girl.</li>
    <li> Good for making thick, curly hair manageable.  Slightly tricky when self-straightening roots close to crown of head but expected. Would suggest to anyone seeking to remove volume and maintain straight hair during minimal activity. Thick hair will still revert with increased activity and humidity. But great product good for in-between relaxer treatments.</li>
    <li> Love this thing !!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Waited too long to test it out. It never worked. Too late to send it back. My loss.</li>
    <li> This product is good and I like that it allows you to adjust the heat.  My hair can only take the nearest to the lowest heat possible because of its natural &amp;#34;fragility&amp;#34; so this hot comb is just great.  I like the Tourmaline in it as well!!</li>
    <li> I love this hot comb. I have been natural for 4 years. I always have had a professional press and now I can do it myself with excellent results. Be sure to use a nice pressing creme for best results.</li>
    <li> Great hotcomb! Just watch how you hold it so that you don&#x27;t turn it off by mistake.&lt;br /&gt;Happy Pressing!! :)</li>
    <li> I love this hot comb for quick maintenance between visits to my hairdresser. I owned a different comb by the same manufacturer but had trouble with it because the on-off controls were placed in the middle of the handle, so I kept shutting it off accidently during use. The design on this version has relocated the controls higher on the handle, so no accidental shut-offs.  I like that you can control the level of heat, and I have had no problem with it getting hot enough to do my hair without resorting to the highest heat setting. I would buy again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> Comb does not get hot enough.</li>
