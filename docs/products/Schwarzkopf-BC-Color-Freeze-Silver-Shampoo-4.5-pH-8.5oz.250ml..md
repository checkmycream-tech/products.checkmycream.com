<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works fabulous for pulling the brassy color out of my hair.</li>
    <li> Best purple shampoo I&#x27;ve found yet. Smells great. As with any purple shampoo, if you use it too much, it will keep lightening your hair and eventually get it really white/silver, so use in moderation.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!! My hair was toned, very soft &amp; smelled great after just one use!</li>
    <li> Love love love this purple shampoo! Have been using it occasionally for years! If you have blond hair- it&#x27;s a must.</li>
    <li> I needed this product for my highlights because some turned out gold and I was so happy to find this quality shampoo on amazon.</li>
    <li> I use this on my highlighted hair and within seconds the yellowy tones were taken out! love it! just be careful not to leave too long as it may turn your light blond silver! awesome shampoo for shine and soft hair too</li>
    <li> This is an ok product for every day use for blondes.Overall,I thought it did a good job cleansing my hair but I did not notice any change in the tone of my hair. I have medium blonde hair with some ash tones on the ends but this shampoo did not tone my brassy roots.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for me. Loved the smell and condition it left my hair. Great price too!</li>
    <li> I noticed a very slight difference in a few areas.</li>
    <li> Gets rid of brassiness on silver white hair. Don&#x27;t over due it or you have purple hair. Use it once per week.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. Makes my grey look so much better. Takes out the yellow and is also not harmful to environment</li>
    <li> First off, if I could I would give this product more than five stars. About a month ago I decided to bleach my very dark hair to a platinum blonde - this resulted in several bleaching sessions and severe damage to my hair. Three bleaching attempts later and my hair was mostly a pale blonde but with large chunks the most heinous golden brassy color - it was really just embarrassing. I knew I had to do something while I waited for my hair to stabilize, but I had found in the past that purple shampoo not only failed to tone down the brassiness, but also seemed to damage my hair further. Through research I finally discovered Schwarzkopf Bonacure Color Save Silver Shampoo, saw it had great reviews and immediately ordered myself a bottle. My expectations in the beginning were very low, so when I saw in the first usage that my hair was somewhat less brassy, I was pleased but not yet blown away. By the third usage, the mind blowing awesomeness of this product finally became apparent; brassiness all but gone! My hair was slowly evolving into the most gorgeous and natural looking light blonde! People started commenting on my \\&quot;new\\&quot; blonde hair, absolutely astounded how much better (and healthier!) it was looking. I have continued to use this product several times a week and my hair has only gotten lighter - I feel like I&#x27;m toning it without using a chemical toner, which really has been a relief to my very delicate hair. My hair is not quite platinum blonde, but I do have a few sections that have been brought to white by this shampoo. I will be chemically toning my hair within the next week and this shampoo will be indispensable in keeping it that perfect platinum shade. I still have more than half a bottle left, but I love this shampoo so much that I just purchased my second bottle. I highly recommend this to anyone that is maintaining chemically treated blonde hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; shampoos and this is my favorite.  I did not necessarily expect it, so it was a nice added bonus, that it is conditioning and smells great.  I have not used my blue malva since I got this because this is way more conditioning and my hair looks better for it.</li>
    <li> WORKS. Takes out brassiness that appears after getting foils done. Definitely don&#x27;t leave on more than a few minutes or use more than once a week or your hair may start looking lavender/purple.</li>
    <li> Makes the silver in your hair just POP.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, it actually does what it says. Great product. Hair feels great. And looks great.  It did spill out of the package.</li>
    <li> Is this really Schwarzkopf? I&#x27;m a loyal user of this product and brand for years and got lazy, I didn&#x27;t feel like going to ULTA. This product does not smell, feel or work like Schwarzkopf I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s authentic.</li>
    <li> I followed the instruction but didn&#x27;t see any difference. I keep using twice a weeks for 2 months, keeping Nitlonger each time and still no effect on my hair (more effect on my curtain shower ;-b&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still golden blond when I wished I was more ash blonde.&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, I tried.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.</li>
    <li> I honestly cannot believe how well this shampoo works. I&#x27;m a natural dark brunette, but have it a  fairly light blonde.  I&#x27;ve used  both shimmer lights and the Jhirmack version if purple shampoo and the results were barely noticeable. I even left the Jhirmack on for an hour and a half once to see if I&#x27;d get better results. The very first time I used the Schwarzkopf, I left it on for three minutes and I was absolutely blown away by how much less gold and brasiness I had in my hair. This is literally the first thing that&#x27;s ever given me the blonde I really wanted. I could not be any happier. I&#x27;ve now used it for the second time, and it just keeps getting better. So happy to have found this product. Thanks to all the other reviewers!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful shampoo.  You don&#x27;t need to &amp;#34;wash and repeat&amp;#34;  and you don&#x27;t need to use alot of the product.  The result is shiney, silky hair with a wonderful, soft smell.  It keeps my highlights looking fresh and bright.  Expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my silver hair! Keeps it super fresh in color. Although it does dry my hair out quite a bit. But totally fixable with conditioner! I would suggest putting it on dry hair, for the color to soak in better. Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> My shampoo arrived as color freeze and looked a little different from the original packaging in the picture. So far the shampoo has work great just as I assume the color care would.  I use it every other day.</li>
    <li> Came in as described and in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> Kept my hair blond and not coppery!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal fan of Clairol Shimmer Lights, but Schwartzkopf blows it out of the water. Consider me a convert. It smells nice, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, and the purple color is super rich. I&#x27;ve used it twice, and I can already see a major difference in my hair color. For reference, I have naturally black hair, bleached blonde. Even after professional toning, the color was still very warm and brassy, but the Schwartzkopf shampoo is cooling it down nicely. In two washes, I have gone from orange, to a much nicer strawberry blonde. The bottle says to rinse the shampoo out immediately if you have blonde hair, but I let it sit for about two minutes before rinsing.</li>
    <li> Really great shampoo. I&#x27;ve used purple shampoos in the past but never liked them. This shampoo really works!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I use it to deal with the business in my blonde hair. I don&#x27;t do what it says (rule breaker!) and wash it right off — I leave it on for about 5 minutes before I wash it off. It seems to have more of an effect.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit annoying to do that, though, because it does drip and goes into my eyes, unlike most shampoos and conditioners I would leave in, which is a bit strange.&lt;br /&gt;I found L&#x27;oreal Brass Banisher to have better results than this, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s an actual treatment, and it&#x27;s only a one-time thing. This is just purple shampoo, you can use it as many times as you wish.&lt;br /&gt;It controls my brass perfetctly fine, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This is The Best purple shampoo for platinum hair I love it! I have tried many other platinum shampoos but this has worked the best for me!</li>
    <li> I have bought every brand of COLOR DEPOSITING purple shampoo to tone down my blond (which tend to go yellow) and allow my naturally light gray hair to blend better with my blond. Some purple shampoos just brighten up white/gray hair, and some actually deposit color similar to a toner at a beauty salon. This shampoo is better than any other more expensive shampoo I&#x27;ve tried - most of which cost way more. I&#x27;ve repurchased this on Amazon and won&#x27;t use any other brand now.</li>
    <li> This product along with the Blonde Me bleach and developer are awesome!</li>
    <li> Great fragrance and my it seems to condition hair, so while wet, it feels fairly soft.  Fragrance is lovely.  Seems to do its job, keeping yellowing away, although I only use &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; shampoo once a week or so.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t really do much for my hair, and I leave it on for a couple minutes every time I wash my hair. Yellow still showed through. I&#x27;ll give it 3 stars since it smells nice like vanilla-ish and it didn&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking this would tone down my new brassy highlights that I got the other weekend but I was wrong and that&#x27;s okay! Everyone&#x27;s hair is different, at least I have a good smelling shampoo that makes my hair feel thick and soft!! : )</li>
    <li> This is great to get rid of those ugly yellow/peach tones left in your hair after bleaching/coloring--&lt;br /&gt;Or even because of environmental factors. I love it, but you&#x27;d better follow directions and don&#x27;t leave it in too long. You will look like an anime character. If that&#x27;s your thing, no biggie! But I didn&#x27;t feel purple that day.&lt;br /&gt;If you do make that mistake, use a clarifying poo 2x&#x27;s- Like Suave (don&#x27;t have to get high brand)&lt;br /&gt;And the purple washes out- your hair will still be toned though and it lasts a good while. I use the color save conditioner as well - also very good and leave-in spray.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the purple turn you away from this product- it&#x27;s far better than Clairol&#x27;s Shimmer Lites. And even though I love the box toners, &#x27;poos are really a simple alternative; without the commitment. Try it! :P</li>
    <li> This is a strong shampoo for toning.  It is a deep, dark purple.  It does not really lather up.  I view it more as a toner than a shampoo.  I use it sparingly a couple of times a month when I need to strongly tone down the silver.  I don&#x27;t view it as a regular shampoo in my repertoire.  It has a fairly strong, slightly bitter scent.  It will stain the tub due to its dark color.  I put it on the ends of my hair and let it soak for several minutes and then I generally lather up with another silver shampoo (Pureology or Aveda Black Malva work best for my money).  Be careful not to let it sit too long if your hair is very white as mine is, it might get a bit lavender.  I do consider this an important product in my toolkit for silver hair, but do not recommend it for daily use.</li>
    <li> Although this is a very dark purple shampoo, it doesn&#x27;t deposit the purple pigment into your hair to do what it should. It smells good, but doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This is the best toner shampoo for Blondes I have used. It moisturizes and take out the brassiness that comes with bleached hair. I use this about twice a week and it keeps my blonde hair looking platinum! Great product</li>
    <li> When my dad went gray, there was a product for men called Come Alive Gray, alas, not for women.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo, a gorgeous purpley blue has kept the yellow out of my hair and given my gray a&lt;br /&gt;wonderful silver sheen.</li>
    <li> I like it, very good shampoo!</li>
    <li> So happy with this shampoo! I used shimmer lights on my very blonde ombr&amp;eacute; and it did absolutely nothing but this shampoo is awesome! I saw a lot less orange and brassiness after only using it once. Also it did not dry out my hair like shimmer lights did. The bottle says to rinse immediately after putting it on but that doesn&#x27;t accomplish much. I left it on for almost 30min and had great results. I wouldn&#x27;t over due it though, my hair started getting gray because I was leaving it on too long. I laid off of it for a week and the grayness went away. I&#x27;m using it once or twice a week and no complaints here. I love it</li>
    <li> This stuff really works, it does tone your hair. I have naturally dark brown hair and I double-process bleach it until I am completely platinum. It keeps the brass away, smells nice and does not dry my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 4/5 partly because it works TOO WELL; If you get it on your shower curtain, walls, tile, tub, towels...wash it IMMEDIATELY. It will stain. Also, if you leave it in your hair too long, you&#x27;ll have lilac-violet hair for a few days.</li>
    <li> Seriously works! Best brand of purple shampoo, it took away the brassy orange blonde that I had after a poorly done ombre</li>
    <li> This is the best silver shampoo I have tried. If you have slightly brassy/gold hair, this product works wonders in toning down the unwanted gold colors. I feel like it is a bit stronger than the other generic purple shampoos, such as Shimmer Lights, which was exactly what I was looking for. I have left the product on my hair for over a minute and not had my hair turn purple.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and maintains my (dyed) silver hair.</li>
    <li> Love the product.  I had natural light brown hair and I bought several different types of box hair dye in an attempt to dye my hair blonde. My hair had a reddish tint with allot of brassiness even after dying my hair 4 times. This product made a difference the very first wash. Now my hair is a beautiful blonde color and I have received many compliments. The plus side is even if you have some gray like me it makes your hair look like you had highlights done. I will purchase this product again and I highly recommend it. One bottle will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and that it leaves the hair soft. I was using a different purple shampoo but it left my hair coarse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This silver shampoo is strong! I left it on my hair a little too long and it kind of tinted my hair :-( So next time I&#x27;ll put in, wash and rinse right away.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does EVERYTHING it promises. It took two washes to get the brass color out of my blonde highlights. Shimmer lights doesn&#x27;t come close! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This product really works for me when I get my hair frosted and it come out a little to blonde, it blends the colors and works quite well.</li>
    <li> I use this almost every time I wash my hair and it really tones down the yellow/brassy color. After I bleached my hair, I painted the shampoo on yellow spots with a coloring brush,left it on for about 20 mins, washed it out,  then proceeded with the toner. It made a noticeable difference!</li>
    <li> This product&#x27;s performance is amazing. If you&#x27;ve bleached your hair, then you know that it can sometimes have yellow streaks instead of the desired platinum-blonde color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo truly makes a difference. It will gradually fade away the yellow and give you a more natural-looking, creamy beige-blonde. It really does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***If your hair has turned out entirely neon yellow or dark orange after bleaching, then you didn&#x27;t leave the bleach on long enough, and that&#x27;s a separate issue. I doubt this product will make a major difference if you fouled-up the bleaching process or if your hair is simply too dark and doesn&#x27;t respond well to bleach.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m surprised and impressed that such a relatively inexpensive, easy-to-find product produces such dramatic, professional-level results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need to go to a salon in order to get perfect blonde hair. I know that many people use a toner after bleaching, but with this product, I don&#x27;t even need a toner, I&#x27;m satisfied with the color I&#x27;ve achieved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the cost!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: If you leave this product on too long, it will turn your hair purple-gray-white. This can be fixed by washing it again with regular shampoo, but it may take several washes.&lt;br /&gt;You will end up with a very cool-toned ashy blonde. If you are going for more of a golden-blonde look, then be cautious with this product...</li>
    <li> Very pigmented, and can stain showers/walls. Otherwise it&#x27;s a great product, didn&#x27;t dry out my long highlighted hair, and kept the blonde parts blonde for 10 weeks without any additional touch-ups/toning. Good price too, one bottle lasted about 3mos washing every other day.</li>
    <li> A much better shampoo than, for example, Clairol shimmer lights - does not damage your hair as much and does eliminate brassiness better. Of course it is not going to make super brassy hair white after one wash, but it definitely works.</li>
    <li> I had used a Schwarzkopf styling product years ago and enjoyed its pleasant scent, so I thought I would enjoy this product. I absolutely hated this product because it has a repulsively strong scent of cheap perfume and caused me to have an allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first disappointment was reading the warning on the label: \\&quot;Product may cause an allergic reaction. Discontinue use in case of allergic reaction Harmful if swallowed, avoid contact with eyes and may cause skin irritation in certain individuals. Keep shampoo bottle out of direct sunlight. Keep out of reach of children.\\&quot; As someone who is sensitive to perfumes, I expected the worst after reading this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have blond highlights, so I followed the instructions to massage it into my wet hair and then immediately rinse it out. The shampoo did not lather well at all. Within hours of washing my hair, my scalp became extremely itchy. Suspicions confirmed: this product is not for those with sensitive skin! Thankfully, Amazon offered me a full refund without having to return this item, which I will donate to someone who enjoys smelling like they are wearing an entire bottle of old-lady perfume. The perfume smell was so sickening that I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash my hair just to stop smelling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that this product contains Acid Violet 43, which according to EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep database, has been \\&quot;Banned or found unsafe for use in cosmetics\\&quot;, at least in some countries.[source: [...]</li>
    <li> I am not sure if this really keeps my hair from getting brassy - which is why I purchased it.  But I think it is a good shampoo and smells great.  I have repurchased since.</li>
    <li> It does have a lot of pigment, which I love.  However, it&#x27;s not sulfate free, so its damaging and leaves my hair dry and brittle feeling.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; or silver shampoos and recommended by my hairstylist. All of these types of shampoos tend to be a bit drying. To combat that I use this 50% of the time use another color treated system aimed at color protection and moisture on the other days of the week. However it does a great job of keeping my platinum from going bronze (which my hair really loves to do). Despite swimming laps once a week in the pool and having very hard water (not sure if that matters), this shampoo keeps my blond yellow not orange - yay!</li>
    <li> I have colored my hair for decades and decided to grow in my natural color. The colored part of my hair is medium golden blonde. My hair stylist told me to use purple shampoo to tone down the gold and darken the white during the transition. It certainly softens and refines the &amp;#34;color change line.&amp;#34; Schwarzkopf was a brand name I trusted.</li>
    <li> I color my hair an ashy medium brown color, but it just naturally wants to turn brassy and golden. I’ve found the BC silver shampoo really helps in toning down the brass and maintaining color longer. I do find the shampoo to be quite drying, but it’s nothing that a good deep conditioning afterwards can’t take care of. Also, be warned that even though it’s called silver shampoo, it is actually a dark purple and can make a bit of a mess in your shower. I only use the shampoo about once a week and leave it on for a couple of minutes. If you have really blonde hair, it would probably help to use it more often though.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo every other day to keep my blonde highlights ashy and not golden.  I can&#x27;t buy it anywhere locally so purchase this on Amazon every time I order it.  I have tried other purple/silver shampoos and I always come back to this one.  Some smell better but don&#x27;t lather or just don&#x27;t work as well.  This is my favorite still.</li>
    <li> It did not have the expected effect at all. The color of my hair stayed the same yellowish as it was before using. I thought maybe it will take many times when the product start working, but it never happened even after 10 times. I used different brand after and it worked after first usage. So I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best purple shampoo I have used to date. I had just put highlights in my hair on top of a medium natural blonde. Needless to say with our hard water, after just a week my highlights were turning yellow and the base color I had used was turning brassy. The first time I used this shampoo I washed it out immediately as the directions stated, and only noticed a subtle difference in my yellow tones. So the next time I used it I left it on for about a minute or so, and washed it out. This time I noticed a big difference. My highlights are almost platinum now, and are back to the beige-y blonde that  they were when I first did them. As for the base color I used under the highlights, it is still a little brassy but is slowly turning into a really light blonde. This is the best blonde I have ever had. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about having that ugly yellow dishwater blonde. The only reason I did not rate this shampoo 5 stars is because it is a little drying. My hair feels crunchy in some spots if I do not condition well enough after using it. But that could also be due to the bleach from the highlights. Nonethelss, you should still use a good conditioner with this shampoo. I would totally recommend this shampoo to anyone who wants to maintain their blonde hair and combat yellow tones.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife who spent a fortune on her hair coloring. She swears the product is amazing, and she is VERY particular about this type of stuff- she has no problem returning products that are anything less than stellar, and apparently this is a keeper</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tries all competitive brands silver shampoos. I always return to this one. It is surely the best.</li>
    <li> This purple shampoo is amazing! Takes the brassy tones out of my hair in minutes. Leaves hair a lil dry so condition after</li>
    <li> I have highlights and have been in the sun lately so my hair got bleached out...this brought it back to the original highlighted color!</li>
    <li> I have highlighted hair and typically use the Paul Mitchell Platinum Shampoo which is also purple, however my hair dresser had run out, and there wasn&#x27;t free shipping on Amazon, so I decided to try this.  It worked just as well and I&#x27;ll probably be using this brand from now on, I think it may have been cheaper too.  Great product to get out brassiness.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I use it once a week and it keeps the brassiness away! Definitely will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Pretty good purple shampoo. Would rate it higher if it brightened more, it does rid brass but I have others that brighten a bit. Still does the job</li>
    <li> Very quick delivery. Very good product to tone down the yellow tones.</li>
    <li> just another blue shampoo</li>
    <li> best stuff ever. thick super suds went from red brassy hair to natural brown hair, i get so many compliments on my hair.  will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> This stuff is seriously amazing. I definitely noticed the difference when I go on vacation and only pack my travel shampoo (mind you, it&#x27;s Nexxus, so it&#x27;s decent stuff). It makes your hair so shiny, bright, and smooth. Will definitely buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist had a bad day and totally &amp;#34;brassed out&amp;#34; my hair, especially my low lights. Rather than go back and have her reprocess my hair, I thought I&#x27;d try this shampoo. First off, it&#x27;s really deep purple. I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it. I&#x27;m sure it would stain anything porous so beware if you have natural stone surfaces in your bathroom to wash away any spilled product asap. I&#x27;ve been using this for about three weeks and am really pleased. The orange tones in my hair are gone as far as I can tell.  After the first few washes, I realized that the front of my hair was better than the back (I guess I tend to apply shampoo in the front and work it in). i ended up &amp;#34;painting&amp;#34; my hair using a mirror over the sink with the product right out of the bottle to get the bits that were still not quite right; I waited a few minutes and then washed hair as usual. Worked great. It&#x27;s nice to have a little control over my hair color, rather than feel like it&#x27;s completely out of my hands.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know the shampoo is black.  Scared me like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.  The manufacturer should have stated it was black in color on the bottle.</li>
    <li> I use my regular shampoo for coloured hair to clean my hair and scalp then I use this shampoo to save the colour,It tones the colour and it doesn&#x27;t dry the hair too.</li>
    <li> Worked like a charm! Used it twice so far on my highlighted hair and I have had several people ask me if I dyed my hair. Tones the bronze out of blonde down to a beautiful, smooth white. Just what I wanted!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works well and does not dry out your hair, I highly reccomend it! It works better on bleached hair.</li>
    <li> Best purple shampoo i have used</li>
    <li> Was really hoping this would help with the brassiness in my hair after bleaching didn&#x27;t work out that well. Tried several days in succession at varying times to see if that might help, 1-7 minutes, without any success. Each time I used the shampoo I had to be sure to scrub my hands afterward thoroughly lest my skin/nails have a purplish hue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t hate it since it wasn&#x27;t that damaging to my hair- I read reviews beforehand about it being drying and made sure to use conditioner. It also has a nice scent which helped make the whole process a little more palatable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the same, disappointed.</li>
    <li> Perfect for platinum hair. My color looked just as good 6 weeks later. Smells great and makes your hair feel great as well.</li>
    <li> This is TRULY purple shampoo. VERY perfumy, that&#x27;s my only gripe. Also, watch your white shower curtains, this is very staining. Works well to tone down the brassy look of blonde (colored) hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed that a high end product contains toxic parabens.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time. It works great and leaves your hair feeling soft after shampooing. Good smell too</li>
    <li> Really takes out all the brass in my light blonde hair in between salon visits. This is a must have for blondes!</li>
    <li> This is the best violet/purple based shampoo, however there is a bit of a downfall: it makes your hair so dry! Fortunately, there are plenty of conditioners and &amp;#34;intense treatments&amp;#34; by the same brand that makes your hair super soft.</li>
    <li> will never use another shampoo again. My grey/white hair never look so good.</li>
    <li> Wow. I wish i knew about purple shampoo sooner. I feel like i just got back from the salon ! I use it on my highlighted hair. My hair feels clean after i use it. The lid on mine does not seem to seal well and bits of it leaks out. Hasn&#x27;t stained anything though.</li>
    <li> Help take out the orange my blonde low lights were trying to grab. I have dark brown hair and this product works well</li>
    <li> i have bleached blonde hair that i tone to a white or almost white color. i have tried at least five purple shampoo products or other purple toners and this is by far the best! it has the deepest purple pigment out of all of my products. i have bought 3 bottles so far and will continue to buy more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect forma my</li>
    <li> Worked wonders to  combat the brassiness that normally happens after my hair is lightened. Will buy again and highly recommend. It lasts a long time if you use it every other shampoo. I still have 1/3 of a bottle left and have been using since early July.</li>
    <li> Best toning shampoo I have ever used! I have very dark brown hair naturally that is now almost platinum blonde, and this keeps the brassiness out consistently. Love it, definitely salon quality.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!  My hair tends to get brassy from time to time and this takes it away.</li>
    <li> didnt make my colored hair any whiter..</li>
    <li> Best toner shampoo for blondes.</li>
    <li> This shampoo worked well for me! I had light yellow bleached-blonde hair, and this product toned it down nicely to a more natural looking blonde. Works very well if you use it with the Clairol Shimmer Lights conditioner.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this shampoo by my hairdresser after the keratin treatment. Unfortunately it contains sodium chloride and cannot be used in my case. So I had to give it away to my friend who has bleached hair. She is happy with this product so far.</li>
    <li> I decided to stop coloring my hair to see how it looked.  I still have some of the light brown color but I am mostly grey.  Right after my hair dresser suggested this product and I used it, I noticed the difference.  This product takes the ashen tones out and leaves the grey looking very silver.  I get a lot of complements on the color of my hair and this product definately gets the credit.</li>
    <li> This is a really good purple shampoo. The best I have ever tried and I have tried many. It does not dry your hair out and it takes away unwanted yellow/gold tones.</li>
    <li> Great product to keep the yellow out of your blond hair, works nice</li>
    <li> Smells ok.  I find it to be very drying compared to other purple shampoos, but it&#x27;s pretty cheap. I use it as a backup to my other purple shampoos.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my stylist to keep my color. My hair is dyed bright red with blond streaks. This product really helps keep the red bright.</li>
    <li> Takes out a little of the orange color but you need to use a real toner to remove it totally.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this. It&#x27;s so nice and pigmented I did notice a difference in my hair after use, unfortunately it&#x27;s also incredibly heavily on the fragrance. It&#x27;s a very cloying scent that definitely lasts all day long. If it was a brighter scent I wouldn&#x27;t mind it much. But it&#x27;s like a heavy floral perfume and I found it triggered a migraine so I had to wash my hair a second time with something else to combat it. If you&#x27;re into heavy fragrances that last, you may just enjoy it, but if you&#x27;re sensitive to scents like I am, steer clear.</li>
    <li> Very nice for grey hair, it won&#x27;t yellow.</li>
    <li> Got it wayyyy earlier than expected about a month!!! But i was going to dye my hair today so ill have to wait to use it :) i love the color and the smell</li>
    <li> Ok, white hair coming in, might as well make it shiny.  Good product line.  Have been using Schwarzkopf products for several years and Amazon&#x27;s prices are really good.</li>
    <li> I had just used a root touch up product in 9A to cover the gray roots on my highlighted hair. It gave me what looked to me like &amp;#34;hot roots&amp;#34;, meaning it was very orange-y at the roots. Gross. I was thinking I&#x27;d have to get a toner of some kind at Sally&#x27;s. While researching toner, I read reviews about how this shampoo could really get rid of the brassiness. I was skeptical, because I have not been all that impressed with other purple shampoos, even the expensive ones. I tried it anyway and I am completely amazed by this product. I left it on for 3 minutes since I had a such a huge problem. My hair is now a perfect ash blonde. There is no hint of orange or yellow anywhere on my head. My hair is also very shiny and has a clean, light feeling that I love. I have hard water and don&#x27;t get to feel that kind of clean too often. I hope they never stop making this stuff. If you just screwed up your blonde and look brassy and awful, try this before you do anything more drastic.</li>
    <li> I almost never write a review but i felt people should be warned about this product.  It turned my dogs and my hair blue!  The info page also did not describe the horrid chemicals in the product.  Many are carcinogens! A total waste of my money!</li>
    <li> It took almost all the brassy tones out of my hair. Even after just one use people were asking if I got my hair done! I just wish it was sulfate free. Can&#x27;t use it after my Brazilian blowouts.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great price and Schwarzkopf makes great products. I have had platinum colored hair for several years and tried lots of differently purple shampoos. This one is definitely my favorite. I put it on first thing when I&#x27;m in the shower and rinse it out at the end and my hair is just the right shade of platinum – not too white, definitely no brassiness and not a purple hue at all.</li>
    <li> I went in for a Gwyneth Paltrow blonde and came out with a Nikki Minaj orange!  Not trusting the salon to fix the color they screwed up, I searched for an alternative to cut down the brass.  Within one washing, my hair color started to even out, and within two, it was a normal color again!  I was a little leery because of the &amp;#34;silver save&amp;#34; being in the title and wasn&#x27;t sure if it worked well for blondes.  But it worked great to tone down the terrible brassy highlights the salon left me with.  I definitely recommend this for bad color fixes as well as for blonde maintenance.  I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but it perks up my color the couple times a week I do use it!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anybody who&#x27;s hair decided to pull lemon yellow after bleaching to blonde! This is what happened to me, and no matter how much my stylist tried to tone it, I was still &amp;#34;lemoncello yellow.&amp;#34; After about a week of using this shampoo and leting it sit like is recommended for silver hair, mine FINALLY went that nice ashy blonde. Awesome job, shampoo!</li>
    <li> Great product. Definitely toned down the yellowness of my blond hair. Softening and giving it a less brassy look. I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> I use one squirt of this shampoo in addition to my regular shampoo each time I wash my very grey hair.  There is no staining this way and it&#x27;s enough to keep brassiness at bay.  I don&#x27;t do anything different--just lather up and rinse.  I like it!</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd bottle it is perfect and does the job for a great price</li>
    <li> The best on the market for white or silver hair.  It takes out any hint of yellow just sufficiently to make my hair shiny silver but NOT blue or purple.  I have many compliments on the color of my hair and have had several strangers ask if they can just touch my hair.  I have found that my hair tends to turn more to the blue side if I use it every shampoo,  so I use it only every other shampoo.</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended this product when I went in for highlights.  I hate brassy blonde and she said if I used it once a week my hair would stay normal looking - I guess chemical and water deposits will otherwise lend it a orangey hue over time.  It has been a month and so far so good.  I use it once a week and my hair is neither purple (a slight disappointment to my husband) or brassy blonde.  I&#x27;ll update if something drastically changes, but so far it is working well.</li>
    <li> its a very quality product, turns my hair so beautiful, i m going to order it again, its a really nice silver shampoo</li>
    <li> I have thick hair that is naturally dark brown. Ive bleached it several times and its finally mostly blonde. It did have quite a bit of red tone as well as a lot of brassy tones. This prduct does cut down some of the brassines but only after quite a few washes...not a miracle cure as some described it... atleast not for me.</li>
    <li> This product worked great to get the extra brass out of my hair. It gets pretty foamy and smells nice too.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to someone seeking to remove mild to medium brass in their hair.</li>
    <li> works great...just a problem with the top...but got worked out.</li>
    <li> I have to be careful because I have a very sensitive scalp.  I use this shampoo once a week and get nothing but compliments on the lovely shade of blonde my hair has become.  No red or brassiness...  eeeek.  I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> When you use this shampoo, you don&#x27;t get results right away it takes a few shampoos to tone the hair. I would NOT recommend this for any drastic changes, this is just a purple shampoo. Just be careful it is drying to the hair so make sure you condition really good.</li>
    <li> I like the shampoo because my hair still feels soft afterwards, but I didn&#x27;t notice much of a color change like other reviews say. I was hoping it would be a miracle worker and get rid of my brassy tones in my bright blonde hair, but after using it four times I haven&#x27;t seen a difference. I prefer it over Clairol&#x27;s Shimmer Lights purple shampoo just because it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair so bad like the other stuff, but color-wise I saw more improvement with Clairol.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best!  I was so sick of being yellow after my haif dressers toner wore off.  Can&#x27;t believe how great this is.</li>
    <li> I have always bought this product for my blonde hair and I love it. Helps fight the brassiness. The formula is more condensed than most. A little bit goes a long way. Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I have platinum hair, and this gives that extra bit of platinum to a yellow bleached out head... Be careful using on pre-bleached hair as it tends to grab color very quickly.. Don&#x27;t give up, keep using until you get the desired look...</li>
    <li> This shampoo is freakin&#x27; AWESOME! Forget about Shimmer Lights. This shampoo puts it to shame. In fact Shimmer Lights and other comparable brands aren&#x27;t even worthy to be compared with this shampoo. I have platinum blonde hair and I hate any sort of yellow in it. In one shampoo, this brand did what the other brands hadn&#x27;t done in spite of being used 2-3 times a week: namely got rid of the yellow tones! One thing I will say as a word of caution: this shampoo really does the job. For that reason, I would recommend using it only once a week and only leaving it on 1-3 minutes. Overdo it and you may end up with violet hair.</li>
    <li> This is seriously the greatest stuff ever. I got an ombre a couple of months ago that left the ends of my hair prettty orange. I finally decided to do something about it and this shampoo is AMAZING! my hair is naturally pretty dark naturally, so i left the shampoo in a little longer than recommended and it&#x27;s slowly but surely turning into the light color i was originally going for! Does leave my hair pretty dry, but i expected it and use moroccan oil hair maskafter every use and my hair is silky smooth! definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> THIS MAKES YOUR SILVER/WHITE/GREY HAIR COLORATIONS SPARKLE AND SHINE: NOT OILY OR GREASY TO ME: DOES NOT IRRITATE SKIN AS SOME OTHER PRODUCTS TEND TO DO:&lt;br /&gt;HOPE THIS WILL PLEASE YOU ALSO:&lt;br /&gt;DAILY BLESSINGS:  GRANNY DORIS</li>
    <li> Perfect for keeping the blonde highlights pale. I usually end up with very brassy tones and have to re-highlight more often than I would like. Bought this and use it every other day and it keeps my blonde nice a pale. Keeps the red in my natural brown down a bit too. If i use it every day my hair tends to get a bit white. Smells great, makes my hair feel great, and silly me loves the purple color. Will order again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Ok but no English instructions</li>
    <li> The whitest my hair has ever gotten! Amazing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used purple shampoo before, but after going ombre I want to take care of my hair as best I can. I&#x27;ve done ombre hair a year ago, but at that time I noticed the brassiness almost immediately, and I never did take care of that, so I always had orange-tone brown ends. This time around I did more research on how to keep my hair as &#x27;ash-tone&#x27; as possible. I also bleached my hair lighter this time. So far my hair hasn&#x27;t been brassy yet. i&#x27;ve used this shampoo around 5 times, so I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s working but only time will tell.</li>
    <li> I had high expectations for this, but it actually offered no help to my hair turning brassy. I will be searching for another silver shampoo that actually works and maybe won&#x27;t dry out my hair as much.</li>
    <li> Will continue to order</li>
    <li> My stylist told me to try a silver shampoo inbetween colorings, as my purple/silver-toned toner often washes out. I like an ashy blonde color to my highlights AND my darker lowlights.  I first tried this product by using it like a normal shampoo and oops.... I already had my dark brunette roots growing in and it made my roots look dull and gray. So, I waited about a week and it washed out, and i started using it about once a week, and mixing a TEENY dab (I mean, a small squirt) in with my normal hydrating shampoo (because, this shampoo does have a tendency to dry my hair out...which is good for texture I might add).  It works GREAT like this.  I just had my color done, so in a few weeks I&#x27;ll go back to using it as I described above. I saw someone above say they painted it on certain streaks and I&#x27;m excited to try that. I have a few platinum blonde pieces underneath that poke out, and I think that would brighten them up, while leaving my darker roots alone.  I&#x27;ve used Aveda blue malva&amp;lt;?&gt; or something, and didn&#x27;t like it. The other product I happen to like is by John Frieda, and it&#x27;s meant for toning blondes down. But this stuff is less gradual and more immediate. love it</li>
    <li> It does a wonderful job cleaning the scalp while not stripping your hair of natural oils.  However, the color payoff is not strong to notice a difference right away.  I still had some orange undertones even after multiple uses.</li>
    <li> used the first time and it worked wonders on taking any brassiness out of hair.  i will definitely be using nothing other than this product for shampooing.  i would highly recommend this product to others.  it also leaves hair manageable and shiny</li>
    <li> My hair can become brassy quickly after it gets colored. I have tried a few other purple shampoos but this one is the bestI have found. It immediately retstores my hair to salon day quality blonde!</li>
    <li> favorite purple shampoo. keeps my blonde color as well as moisturizing and giving my hair a nice soft, silky feel</li>
    <li> I absolutely recommend this shampoo. I tried highlights for the first time, my hair is naturally very dark, therefore had a huge problem with brassiness after I highlighted my hair. This shampoo has made it look so much better I love it!.</li>
    <li> it works and the seller was great!</li>
    <li> Really great. One thing I really like is that you don&#x27;t need to leave it in for a few minutes.You&#x27;d probably love it. :)</li>
    <li> The Schwarzkopf Color Save Silver Shampoo - I researched a variety of brands and this one stood out on the reviews. First of all, there are no directions about how long to leave it in my hair. Secondly, it doesn&#x27;t work. I have tried leaving it in 1-2 minutes and then 5 minutes. Same results, my hair is just as golden as before when I didn&#x27;t use it. Nothing happens. I am very disappointed.  I didn&#x27;t hear a peep from customer service.</li>
    <li> Best purple shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  Very rich color and a lovely musky smell.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair too much.</li>
    <li> My gray picks up pigment from everything.  It was starting to look way to yellow and my silver strands had lost their sparkle. What a relief to find this product! The yellow toned down after the first use and the silver sparkles in the sun again.  Getting LOTS of hair complements again. Other purple shampoos don&#x27;t come close to working as well and I&#x27;ve tried lots of them.  I did  started mixing it with a bit of my regular shampoo because my timing isn&#x27;t great and if you leave it on to long you can pick up some tint. I do advise using rubber gloves. I noticed my nail beds looked a bit purple but that may not be an issue for other people.</li>
    <li> This product is the best toning shampoo I have ever come across. I decided to purchase it after seeing a review on youtube and learning that it was safe for extensions. This product does not streak like some of the cheaper store brands have a tendency to do. And I had a lot of time between application and rinse before the color started setting in. I have bleach white hair and do not like to use developer for toning, and this by far will be the only thing I reach for from now on. It was perfect!</li>
    <li> I have very dark black Asian hair and got some blonde highlights for the first time.  I was worried about my highlights turning brassy so I researched ways on avoiding that, and discovered that I needed to use &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; shampoo.  I reviewed various purple shampoos here on Amazon and on different hairstylists&#x27; websites as well, and decided on this product after the consistent recommendations.  I have used it for several weeks now, and my highlights look shinier and lighter.  I wash my hair a lot, and use this product after using my regular shampoo (I read that the purple shampoos are not really for &amp;#34;washing&amp;#34; your hair to get clean), then condition.  For the price I paid here on Amazon, it is so well worth it.  You don&#x27;t need a lot, and it smells good, too.  Note:  I notice that when I tried using just this shampoo, it does not lather well, but if i use it after shampooing my hair with a regular shampoo, then this one lathers a lot.</li>
    <li> Product is as described, arrived incredibly quick. Love how it makes my white hair almost surreal.</li>
    <li> I have never had problems with an abnormal amount of hair falling out but after using this shampoo once a week for three weeks, my hair is very damaged. Even two weeks after stopping use of this product my hair continues to break and fall out in large amounts every time I brush or touch my hair. Also this wasn&#x27;t an allergic reaction like the bottle warned of, it just damaged my hair.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it will.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m platinum blond and I use this shampoo everyday. It makes me hair looks almost white. Very cool. I&#x27;ve always loved Schwarzkopf products but been having a hard time finding any since I moved to U.S. Big thanks for the seller and Amazon for delivering products that are so hard to find at retail stores.</li>
    <li> great customer service, thank you very nice!</li>
    <li> This stuff really takes the brassy color out of highlights! It doesn&#x27;t make your hair all gross like some of the other purple shampoos. I have fine hair and really like this stuff! Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I use this with a purple rinse and it is amazing! Be careful though, it will stain your shower if you don&#x27;t wipe it away really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited 6/30/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to edit this because a lot of the other reviews don&#x27;t seem to match my experience. I had very dark brown hair and now I have a platinum pixie (think Gwen stefani or pink). I wash my hair a few times a week with this. It doesn&#x27;t really dry out my hair but I also use a purple conditioner with it. The Kevin Murphy Blonde Angel Rinse to be exact. I get in the shower, wash my hair, rinse it out, condition it, leave that on for 1-2 minutes, then rinse. I have NEVER had my hair turn purple or look anything less than platinum. I even think my hair looks better after a few washes than straight from the salon. I have even tried to make it turn purple by leaving the shampoo on then leaving the conditioner on. Still nothing.  So that&#x27;s my experience after using it for about a year now.</li>
    <li> So far, I am really impressed.This does not dry the hair like Clairol Shimmer Lights, and no need for a heavy conditioner afterwards. I used Schwarzkopf in the late 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s, but moved to other brands over time. I am glad to see this is still a quality product.  I will happily continue to use this to keep the brassiness out of my blonde hair.</li>
    <li> My golden blond hair turned gray.When i received it,the shampoo was spilled all over the bottle.</li>
    <li> I bought this to toen down the grassiness in my blond highlights after a bad hair coloring. It is amazing!!!!! I was initially worries about it turning my hair gray or something, but it has only made it look amazing. It also gives your hair a shiny, super pretty gloss for days after using. I love it!</li>
    <li> Did not work for me at all. Made my scalp greasy and my hair dry and flat.</li>
    <li> I have naturally blonde hair and was a little worried how well this product would work.  I am very pleased, my hair has brightened and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the violet color doing anything negative to my hair.</li>
    <li> Alrighty, so as a first time user of this shampoo, I do like it. But I do not see why so many people think it is super-amazing. It is a purple shampoo and it does what a purple shampoo is supposed to do, which is tone down brassy tones and liven up blonde, silver and white hair. I have level 12 neutral blonde with light golden blonde highlights. This shampoo did make my highlights a little more neutral, which is what I wanted, and did liven up the color of my hair a little bit. By liven I mean that it looked brighter-ish. Anyways, I think its a good purple shampoo, it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used the product, but read great things about it online.  I bought a LOT of it, different products, and all of them had labels that were falling off, or peeling off.  Is that normal?</li>
    <li> Great for blondes that tend to go brassy.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo for colored blonde hair I have every used.  It really tones down the brassiness.  Sometimes I&#x27;ll have slight purple streaks if it gets on the more porous parts.  I just apply it to my roots.  Love this!</li>
    <li> Best Purple shampoo to aide in brassy highlights or blonde hair, Makes my hair feel much healthier opposed to Shimmering Lights,</li>
    <li> This is the best toning shampoo I&#x27;ve used. I am a neutral-toned, chemically processed blonde with highlights and lowlights. I use this shampoo 2-3 times a week to maintain my color tone, and combat my natural tendency to go brassy. I usually lather this up and leave it on my hair for about a minute before rinsing it out, and follow it up with a heavy conditioner. The days I use this shampoo there are absolutely noticeable results, and the highlights in my hair look shimmery and almost white, as opposed to a funky yellow color. I was previously using AG Beauty&#x27;s toning shampoo, and this stuff blows it out of the water!</li>
    <li> I only gave it three stars because I have used other shampoo&#x27;s I like better for high lighted hair.I will not buy it again because I could not see any difference in my hair color.</li>
    <li> It might just be me, but I love the smell of this toning shampoo. It does a beautiful job at getting any brassiness out. Bottle arrived leaking, though.</li>
    <li> Works great! My hair was very brassy. I used it once and it went to a yellowish color. That evening I went in for a hair cut and my stylist said for me to leave it in for 5 min each time I use it until I reached the desired color. My hair is a great light blonde now! Great product! Smells really good too but you will definitely need to condition really well after using it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the reviews, but it really dries my hair, an the smell is so awaful, i do prefer the one i was using before naissant</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t eliminate the yellow reflection on my slightly colored hait</li>
    <li> Works and smells great. I used to buy it from my stylist and it was 3x&#x27;s the price. And since I have moved to the mts in Blue Ridge, GA so this works out great. Thx</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference color wise and hair didn&#x27;t feel very clean after washing</li>
    <li> I love it!  Product is just what I wanted and I received my order in two days!</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t really worked for me, my yellow hair remained yellow so not buying again</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this shampoo yet, But I&#x27;ve used the Moisture Kick one and loved it, so I&#x27;m assuming I&#x27;ll love this one too, especially because its for colored hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo removed literally all of my brassiness in three washes. It is a must have for bleach blonde hair.</li>
