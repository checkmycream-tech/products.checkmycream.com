      <li>all the brushes held up throughout the washing (and I used a fairly descent amount of friction to scrub them).</li>
      <li>The brushes are good for the price.  </li>

      <li>amazing.</li>
      <li>Would have been nice to include info on what each brush is used for, but maybe thats just my own inexperience</li>
      <li>It would have been nice if the use (e.g, eye brush) were on the brushes.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s my own fault, and at the price I cannot complain.  </li>
      <li>I think I will just throw away the case and make my own, because if it hasn&#x27;t stopped smelling now, it probably never will.</li>
      <li>Very happy with my brush set, its very durable ( no bristles falling out of brushes).</li>
      <li>but when it comes to traveling the case is nice.</li>
      <li>fortunately I ordered the set for the face brushes and eyeliner brushes and those are good.</li>
      <li>I have been very happy with them so far and have no complaints.</li>
      <li>The brushes are so soft  and work great!</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ve worked perfectly for me so far.</li>
      <li>I am keeping them, the bristles are GREAT - so soft and everything seems really good quality.</li>
      <li>YOU WILL LOVE EACH PROFESSIONAL PERFECT ITEM!!!!!!</li>
      <li>It may not be MAC or better brands, but it does the job.</li>
      <li>but I love the set.  </li>

      <li>and I have used most of the brushes in some way.</li>
      <li>I travel a lot and needed a cheap set to take with me, and these don&#x27;t disappoint!</li>
      <li>I would reccommend to a friend with offering them my opinion on maybe needing more sizes.</li>
      <li>The roll-up case is okay, but reeks of a vinyl/plastic smell.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure that Smell will fade with time</li>
      <li>The big brush gives me perfect coverage and applies evenly.</li>
      <li>All in all I love the brushes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> You got what you pay.  It is definitely made in China, and the price is so low. But you can not say it is not a bargain, either.</li>
    <li> Yes, at first the brushes and the pouch smell. But the brushes lost that chemical smell as soon as I washed them with soap. The chemical smell lingered a little longer for the pouch but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal. The actual brushes I love! I use almost all of them.</li>
    <li> I received my brushes very quickly after I ordered them. I have been very happy with them so far and have no complaints. Very soft on my face and there is a an eye brush of every size making eye shadow application easy and efficient.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price! It did have a bit of a weird smell when I first opened it, but I just let it sit out open for a day and it dissipated. Liked it so much I got one for my niece for xmas!</li>
    <li> These work really well, although one of the brushes did not last very long. I have had no problem with the rest of them. Maybe just a freak thing with the one. I like that the hairs on the brushes do not come out. Some brushes you buy the hairs come out one buy one and get on your face and in your makeup. I have not had that problem with these. I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> Holds more brushes than any other bag out there. Perfect!</li>
    <li> This brush set is pretty nice so far. I have not used it very long but so far I am enjoying them. I have pretty sensitive skin and these brushes are really soft on my skin. I originally bought the set for the eye brushes I saw in it. It also has a convenient carrying case for the brushes if your one the go and they won&#x27;t get ruined just being thrown into you bag or drawer you keep your make up in.</li>
    <li> So I read about the smell and figured I&#x27;d give them a chance hoping the smell would eventually fade. It&#x27;s been over a couple weeks now and the smell is just starting to fade. First, I took them out of the plastic wrappers to let them \\&quot;breathe\\&quot; better and laid them out on my dresser. After a few days, I sprayed Febreeze over them...they still smell a little. My next plan is to give them a good wash. I am keeping them, the bristles are GREAT - so soft and everything seems really good quality. I just haven&#x27;t used them yet because of the smell. When I do I&#x27;ll get back and write an addendum to this review. Here&#x27;s hoping!    Here&#x27;s an update! It&#x27;s been 6 months now and I LOVE these brushes! The smell did fade after a couple of washings (I used regular hair shampoo - nothing fancy) the bristles are still soft, aren&#x27;t shedding, makeup goes on great and they are lovely - a definite recommend!</li>
    <li> I am a makeup artist and I thought these would work perfectly for me! The case they came in is so convenient! When I first got these brushes they worked great! After a couple times using them on my client the Bristles started falling out and three of the brushes are no longer usable. So I&#x27;m hoping this doesn&#x27;t happen to the rest of them! Other than that they work nice! Just not worth the money if they&#x27;re falling apart</li>
    <li> Great set for a great cost!  I recommend this product for traveling.  It helps me to stay organized for travels.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know all the uses of every brush. It would have been nice if the use (e.g, eye brush) were on the brushes.</li>
    <li> i was really surprised at the softness of the bristles, everyone is always bashing fash but i decided to take a risk, and i loved it!</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes that don&#x27;t shed! Get these if you&#x27;re into makeup!</li>
    <li> I never ever wright about the stuff that I get off amazon. but I had to do one for this. I really love the brushes, they came real fast. I did a big order and this was the first thing that came in the mail. The Brushes are individually rapped the foundation and bush brushes have protective sleeves that you can keep which i think is awesome! they had a funny smell when i first got them but i let them air out overnight and they were good to use the following morning. I just really like these brushes and for the price you can not bet it!! ODER NOW!!!!</li>
    <li> Wow they are so so soft I barely used them today and they work absolutely amazing. The feel good on my skin haha sounds weird XP but really soft brushes and work amazing. There is a slight odor idk i cant really explain it, but its not that bad i just leave the bag opened so they can breathe. Its not even a strong strong odor just slight. But of course the smell will go away but again amazingly soft sturdy brushes. I recommend(: They came a day before they were expected I was so happy!</li>
    <li> I bought this set a couple of years ago, I just recently started using it and omg, these brushes are amazing!!!! They don&#x27;t shed at all and sturdy,  very well made and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> These are great make up brushes, especially for the money. They did have a smell like others said, but it didn&#x27;t bother me. And it has since gone away. I would definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> This is my first set off make up brushes so i have no frame of comparison but they get the job done. Would have been nice to include info on what each brush is used for, but maybe thats just my own inexperience</li>
    <li> Great gift for my 17 year old daughter.  She loves makeup, and loves glam.  Perfect!  She&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy.  I would highly recommend this set.</li>
    <li> Ordered 3 sets of these, since they were rated pretty well, as Xmas gifts for a few girl-friends.  Nice assortment of brushes in general.  However, one set was missing the largest powder brush all together.  The eyelash combs in two of the sets were missing teeth.  If I put all three sets together, I could have come up with one that was worthy of giving as a gift.  Sent all three back and will go to Sally Beauty or Walgreens to look at them in persone before purchasing... Lesson learned, not all things can be reliably purchased online.  DVDs and books are one thing, makeup brushes are, apparently, another.</li>
    <li> i love this set only reason i didn&#x27;t give it 5 star is because i dont use all the items lol but i love it</li>
    <li> Amazing Value for the quality. I was looking for something inexpensive because MAC brushes are breaking my wallet and I was pleased with the quality of these brushes. There are a lot of brushes here great for eyes. I wish It had a round circle brush, but the flat brushes and flat angled brush are great and I love the large round brushes for brush, bronzers and highlighters. I can&#x27;t say that the small flat angled brush competes with my MAC small angled flat brush but it is a decent one... Can&#x27;t beat the quality for the price!</li>
    <li> I purchased this a s a gift for my son&#x27;s friend for back to school.  She loved it.  I wanted to keep it.  The case smelled a little strong, kind of petroleum-ish but I&#x27;m sure that will pass.  It&#x27;s a lovely little set and makes a wonderful gift.</li>
    <li> These brushes are whatevs. I like them enough but I don&#x27;t use them. I go for a different set I have but when it comes to traveling the case is nice.</li>
    <li> Perfect!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Exactly what i paid for.  Very soft on my face and there is a an eye brush of every size making eye shadow application easy and efficient.</li>
    <li> I bought this set because I&#x27;m new to the world of makeup, and I wanted something that had a lot of brushes for a a decent price. The other reviews helped me choose this set. Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it. There&#x27;s a lot of brushes to choose from, except for a good time blush brush. I feel like the bigger ones are too soft to really spread blush and/or loose powder. I especially like the eyeliner brush and the foundation brush.</li>
    <li> The brushes are good for the price.  Brushes are more stiff and not as full as I&#x27;d like but again, not bad at all for the price.  The case has a bad fake leather/rubber smell but all I did was remove the brushes and left the case sit out in my living room for about a week and the smell went away.</li>
    <li> Came on time, and works great. I use them everyday and they work wonderfully. I highly recommend them for makeup application! I really enjoy mine.</li>
    <li> Really like the brushes! Would order again! The smell the other reviews were talking about is just the smell of new plastic from the case, not from the brushes. Would recommend! The shipping was fast too!</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the brushes. They are soft and seemingly well-crafted. Perfect for the amount I was willing to spend on a set of brushes.</li>
    <li> Lots of brushes to choose from.  Folds up nicely, can&#x27;t wait to use it on my vacation next month. Could make a great gift as well.</li>
    <li> I love these soft brushes and its affordable! The only complaint is ...1 brush arrived w/ a little loose, but its way better than e.l.f.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; makeup brushes, and so far they seem to be doing the trick! I may update later on, as I use them more, but no shedding of bristles, nothing that wouldn&#x27;t make me order them again.</li>
    <li> The brush set exceeded my expectations.  The are soft on the skin and apply make up nicely.  Great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> half of the brushes are super soft and nice, i love them. the other half are not so soft specially eyeshadow brushes. fortunately I ordered the set for the face brushes and eyeliner brushes and those are good. the bag had a distinct smell but after airing it out now is usable.</li>
    <li> I like these but they smell a bit funny and shed.  They do the trick and they are a great price.  I would buy again if needed.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!  They are far far superior than the one brush I paid more than double the amount that this entire set cost.&lt;br /&gt;They are soft to the skin, easy to clean and blend nicely.  Very well made and worth the price and more.  Love these brushes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have stated, the case does have a plastic odor, but it does not transfer to the brushes.  Just air the case outside.  Plus, I really didn&#x27;t use the case anyway.  : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you FASH!!</li>
    <li> I did not give this product 5 stars because of the smell. But most of it went away in couple of weeks. I am not a professional make up artist and probably can not do the best judgement, but I do like quality .</li>
    <li> Omgeeeeeee I love this. Its so soft and blends very well. Im so happy I brought This product shipment was great! Hope to buy new products soon</li>
    <li> Its never arrived to my house. I was very looking forward to it. This is an prime item so it should of been here within a couple days but its been over a week now.</li>
    <li> Very nice set. Bought them for the wife and she just loves them. Well worth buying. Thinking about buying another set.</li>
    <li> I bought these awhile ago and only 3 of the brushes have made it this far. The rest of them broke or the tops fell off. , They didn&#x27;t feel cheap until time started wearing them down, within a week of using them two of the tops fell off. If your considering this set be prepared to buy another set in 1 or 2 months, I would keep looking for different brushes.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my brush set, its very durable ( no bristles falling out of brushes). Came in a cute gold case, they are great gifts !</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush set and the cut sparkly goldish bag it comes with.  The brushes aren&#x27;t too hard, not too soft -- just right and there is a brush for every thing you need when applying makeup.  No shedding and each brush is carefully placed in a plastic film -- whoever made these was careful in the making and packaging of the product.  I am completely satisfied with this purchase!</li>
    <li> The brushes started shedding after a few weeks. There is a good assortment of different sizes and types of brushes if you just want cheap eye shadow brush options. I would not buy this again</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before I bought the brushes so I knew that they were going to have a smell when I opened them.  I washed the brushes thoroughly and after a few days I couldn&#x27;t smell it anymore. (And the smell is just what they absorb from their packaging.)  The brushes are ok, but not great.  The eye brushes lose A LOT bristles all the time, which I&#x27;m pretty sure is not supposed to happen.  But, hey, for $10 what can you really expect?  Overall they do what they&#x27;re supposed to do with only some shedding so they get 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I only needed the angled eye liner brush but figured this would be a good buy. The description is a little misleading because the angled brush is not really for eye liner because it&#x27;s not flat but rather for the brow or for eye shadow. Quality doesn&#x27;t seem too bad for the price of the set.</li>
    <li> I kept reading about this &amp;#34;bad odor&amp;#34; but I did not experience that at all!  The brushes are so soft  and work great!</li>
    <li> Good brushes for the price... Smelled of paint as Soon as I opened package but washed them w baby shampoo and went away... Not a big fan of the blush brush and the powder brush. Doesn&#x27;t seem to pick up enough powder, but all the small brushes are amazing!</li>
    <li> The big brush gives me perfect coverage and applies evenly. Great value because of how many brushes for the price. Totally awesome. Would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> When I order on 10th of September... And Delivery Quick to my Home then open pack I really excited to see how it is... Brush come out so Soft!!!!! I Love so much!!!! Very Perfect to use small brush than elf... Got to BUY More!!!!</li>
    <li> They are perfect for my use.  My coworker who also got a set loves hers.  Great bag and great brushes.</li>
    <li> I use my set every single day and I love it! The brushes are soft and apply my makeup beautifully. I haven&#x27;t had any shedding either.</li>
    <li> I needed new brushes for eyeshadow and found this set. For the same price as three or four eyeshadow brushes, you get the full set of makeup brushes. The eyeshadow brushes in particular are great with different stiffnesses and widths as you would expect. The handles are plastic and a little long (hits the mirror as my nearsighted self applies shadow). All in all I love the brushes. The roll-up case is okay, but reeks of a vinyl/plastic smell. Won&#x27;t use it anyway.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great. I love the travel bag that they come in. It keeps them from moving around and makes it easy to just grab and go. Wonderful price. I also wanted to comment on the smell factor that I seen some people writing about, there is a smell from them being new but after washing them and airing them out the smell is gone.</li>
    <li> Two years ago I spent $130 on a set of makeup brushes I thought would last me forever.  They started falling apart in three months!  This time I figured I&#x27;d buy something inexpensive to see how they work.  These brushes far exceed the quality on my last set, and outperform the old ones, too.  They have enough styles within the case so all my eye makeup can go on just the way I want, and cleaning is easy, too.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price. Very soft brushes, and so many of them! Great packaging, plus the bag is cool for travelling!</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY THE ULTIMATE PERFECTION IN BRUSHES.....EVERYTHING YOU WILL EVER NEED....OR WANT!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE LOVE LOVE EVERY SINGLE ITEM......AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;BUY THESE...YOU WILL LOVE EACH PROFESSIONAL PERFECT ITEM!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This was a wonderful special purchase.  The brushes are high quality the handles are wooden and the roll up pouch keeps everything organized and keeps the brush bristles from being smashed.  I should have bought 1 for my sister and 1 for my daughter!!  Great buy and great value!</li>
    <li> This product came in a short amount of time. The brushes worked well, and although they had an odor from the case, they could. be aired out in just a few&lt;br /&gt; days. Over all, I was happy with this product.</li>
    <li> The brushes were so so soft (perfect for the price), but the only thing I didn&#x27;t like, it smells so bad, like gas, they should work on it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. However, upon receiving the brushes they smelled very chemically. I needed to air them out for like 2days, followed by washing them and then i used them.</li>
    <li> I have always wanted a nice set of makeup brushes but didn&#x27;t want to pay the typical prices, so I thought it was worth taking a gamble on these even though I wasn&#x27;t familiar with the brand and I was a little nervous about the \\&quot;odor\\&quot; that other reviewers described. Items were shipped very quickly. On opening the package, I understood in a flash what other reviewers had complained of: a powerful, vinyl or plastic smell. I removed the brushes from the cellophane wrap and washed them in mild shampoo while also placing the vinyl storage roll in a sunny window for one afternoon. Voila! No more overpowering plastic smell. And the brushes...fantastic! They are all very soft and the shapes are so precise that I can actually get a really nice line of eyeliner on my lid without having to correct with a tissue. This has been one of the best bargains I ever purchased from Amazon. If you are waffling, I recommend you go for it and buy these!</li>
    <li> I bought this set of brushes after reading a lot of reviews about different brush sets on amazon. I choose this one mostly because it had so many brushes for under $20. I did not expect much quality because of the price but I am so surprised by how nice they are for cheap brushes. Besides the fact that they had so many brushes in this set, I brought it because I wanted more shapes and sizes for my eye make up. When the package first arrived, it stunk pretty bad but I had anticipated that. I washed the brushes expecting some of the synthetic hairs to come out but all the brushes held up throughout the washing (and I used a fairly descent amount of friction to scrub them). I aired dried them and I washed the brush set tote (the gold thing it came with, not sure what that is called), in the washing machine and aired dried that as well. It still stinks but not as pungent as when it came. I have had the brushes for a week and I have used most of the brushes in some way. There is good variety in stiffness and looseness in the brushes, although I do wish the eyeliner brush was slightly stiffer for more control but nothing I can&#x27;t work around. I thought this would be a temporary set until I could buy a more expensive set from MAC but I am going to hold off because these are awesome!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great for the price! They&#x27;ve worked perfectly for me so far. The case it comes in is pretty cool and stores them well...the brushes will not fall out because of a flap keeps them in place.</li>
    <li> When I got them and opened up!! Wow!! I was very surprised about the gold case and the brush. looks nicer than the picture. Very soft. I am happy with my purchase and I recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I got these brushes and they are GREAT! For the price I really like them. but when i got them they had a weird smell to them. but once you wash them they are really good. nice and soft.</li>
    <li> This set is AMAZING. The brushes are soft and perfect, and do not shed at all like other brushes for a similar price. Out of all the sets you can buy for this similar price, THIS is the best option!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(As others said, the case smells a little funny, but it fades in time :])</li>
    <li> Bought these for my girlfriend to use for her Esthiology course and, in keeping with the other reviews, the case has an intense smell out of the bag that lingers for quite some time. It&#x27;s been almost a month and there is still a hint of a \\&quot;varnishy\\&quot; odor, but this only applies to the case. She washed the brushes and there is no hint of a smell and she loves them. She has gotten plenty of compliments on how soft the bristles are and how great it works. For the price, you can deal with the smell of the case or just get another case to put the brushes in.</li>
    <li> I am using my husbands account but I just wanted to say I really like this brushes but it seems like there is not enough of them. It seems like there is some missing but what brushes is here is great. There are well made. They did have a lil bit of an odor but after I washed them thats not a problem. The case is cute also. I would reccommend to a friend with offering them my opinion on maybe needing more sizes.</li>
    <li> I think writing down a review should be optional. Just like how it used to be. I just want to give a couple of stars, clear my order history and get on with the rest of my day. But now we can&#x27;t send a rating until we give a review on the product we ordered. I used to only write a review if there was something wrong. I f not, then I give five stars. I don&#x27;t time to write a review for everything I order so I&#x27;ll just copy and paste this on every order. MAKE THIS SECTION OPTIONAL. Thank you and have a great day!</li>
    <li> Received on time. Brushes and brush holding bag looks great.  Having no problem with the brushes leaving hair on my face.</li>
    <li> I bought this set to use when traveling. I was stunned when the product arrived; it was far superior to what I had imagined, and as illustrated! The case was well-made and encased the brushes beautifully. The brushes appeared to be of good quality. I may use these brushes at home as well - there are more of them than my very expensive at-home brushes.</li>
    <li> I bought this set and when i got it  i compare it to other 3 products of similar price and quality and this one is the best out of the four, it is super soft, soft soft, looks beautiful, the case doesnt smell and the color is very nice, it looks fancy, i will recommend it for gifts of for yourself, i gave it to my mother and she loved it.</li>
    <li> this set arrived in the mail on time and was in great shape. i havent had a chance to use it yet, as i dont wear make up on a regular bases, but i am so looking forward to testing these brushes out. they are super soft.</li>
    <li> Bristles are soft. The one thing I noticed immediately is the strong smell. Other than that the product is okay.</li>
    <li> love it! good price and nice quality brushes. The brushes are really soft and I would really recommend this set of brush for others. Great price for the deal!</li>
    <li> There are quite a few brushes for a good price.  The product is as described.  My only problem was the smell, which other reviewers have addressed, and the fact that I don&#x27;t actually need so many brushes.  That&#x27;s my own fault, and at the price I cannot complain.  I&#x27;ll probably keep a few and give the rest away so it doesn&#x27;t take up so much space in my cabinet.  Still, it was the best deal for the money.</li>
    <li> I am writing this review with the help of my wife. I found this to be a decent general product that comes with a case to protect and hold all the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The case is adequately made.&lt;br /&gt;There is a zippered pocket to hold eye shadows or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are not hard or overly soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;There was grease or something on the case when I opened it after pulling it out of the plastic wrap.&lt;br /&gt;Smells like paint thinner even after being thoroughly and repeatedly washed.&lt;br /&gt;Even after washing 3 or 4 times the smell does give headaches.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are not labeled and some of them are very similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just so you know:&lt;br /&gt;The handles are a little long for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;Handel&#x27;s are made of wood.&lt;br /&gt;I bought these on amazon for 19$&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a budget product I am not disappointed but would not recommend it for anything but perhaps a starter kit. (That you intend to replace in the near future.)</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with the quality of the brushes in this set. They are very well made and hold my makeup well, unlike many other and more expensive brushes I have used. The bristles are very soft and are make the brushes equal in quality to brushes that sell for $30 each. Even after washing the brushes many times (to get rid of the toxic smell of the case), no bristles came off and the bristles stayed soft and maintained their shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the smell of the case makes it practically unusable. I have let it air out for weeks and it still has much of the nasty chemical smell that it had originally. I think I will just throw away the case and make my own, because if it hasn&#x27;t stopped smelling now, it probably never will. It is not worth getting headaches from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Even though the case is trash because of the fake leather chemical smell, the brushes are an amazing deal for the price and do not maintain the smell after being washed a few times.</li>
    <li> The time I received it was great the product was great..Lots of brushes  that seem to be of good quality</li>
    <li> I do professional make up and bought this for the case but then when I received it i noticed how good the brushes were i choose these brushes over my $75 to $150 dollar each brushes these dont shed and are light weight nice set to have and the only bad thing is the case smells a lil like new rubber/ paint kinda but I&#x27;m sure that Smell will fade with time and it doesn&#x27;t seem to rub off on brushes add my make up page karmelo Bonilla to see these brushes in use great product plan on ordering several more sets....</li>
    <li> These are actually pretty nice brushes for the price. They are super super soft and didn&#x27;t shed a single hair when I washed them with olive oil and dishsoap. The brand name on each brush is printed somewhat sloppily, but not that big of a deal. Bad thing though is that the bag looks kinda cheap and it smells AWFUL! It&#x27;s like you just opened a damn paint can...it&#x27;s pretty bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the brushes are a good find and feel amazing! The bag just reaks.....</li>
    <li> I really love this brush set. I would advise that you handle with care because the magnet clip on the outside doesn&#x27;t take much for it to rip off. Also the eyebrow comb fell off the stick.</li>
    <li> This set&#x27;s quality was better than I expected. I travel a lot and needed a cheap set to take with me, and these don&#x27;t disappoint! The brush hair is sturdy and super soft. It also holds makeup well. It may not be MAC or better brands, but it does the job. The only thing I would change is the bottom plastic piece; it just looks cheap. Other than that, good buy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rating this product based on the smell alone.  I have not actually used the brushes, as I haven&#x27;t been able to get past the smell.  I think it&#x27;s the case, but it made the brushes smell, too.  It&#x27;s some weird, strong chemical smell.  I can&#x27;t fully describe what it smells like, other than the fact that it takes my breath away (not in a good way) and makes my stomach turn.  The smell transfers to whatever comes in contact with this thing and stunk up my whole drawer and every item within the drawer.  I don&#x27;t know what the case is made of, but I swear it&#x27;s something toxic.  And if I don&#x27;t trust what the case is made out of, I&#x27;m not so sure I trust what the brushes are made of either.  Therefore, I don&#x27;t want them to actually touch my face.  So, they most likely will not.</li>
    <li> The product came right away after ordering it. The brushes are really soft and seem sturdy so far. It does have a slight smell to it, but nothing critical. I think it&#x27;s great for the price!</li>
    <li> Got this as a Christmas present for my teenage daughter - she loved it - very luxurious brushes and cute bag to keep them all toegther</li>
    <li> The brushes work great and are nice and soft, but they have a funky chemical smell which hasn&#x27;t gone away yet even after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I naught them because people said there good but there alright. The brushes are not as full as they could be. The blush brushes were nice but are a little pokey.</li>
    <li> I have not used the brushes yet since I just got them today but they look and feel great!! Soft brushes, and they feel like great quality. I did experience the not so pleasant smell but I received them about an hour ago, took the plastic wrappers off and left them open to air out. The smell is fading already...what the big deal anyways? Its not like they are going to make your eyes smell that way, people can be so picky!! Anyways, I cant wait till this weekend so I can use them, big night on the town!! I recommend them!</li>
    <li> OK so I almost did not buy these because everyone is so disturbed by the odor, which was present when I initially opened this makeup brush set.  Then I washed the brushes thoroughly as stated in the Amazon ad, and left them out to dry for a couple of days.  Like magic &#x3D; no smell.&lt;br /&gt;While I am not a makeup artist and have no talent to ever be one, I love these brushes for what I need.  I have only had them for a little while, but no shedding yet.  I am pleased.</li>
    <li> This set met my expectations. The set has every type of brush I need at a very reasonable price.  The brushes seem to be of good quality.</li>
    <li> These have been good brushes so far.  I have used them for about 3 weeks now and have not had any problems with them shedding.  I do agree with all of the other reviews that said the carrying case smelled like gasoline.  I took the brushes out of the carrying case right away to let them air out for 24 hours after they arrived.  The carrying case is still out in my garage to air out, which is fine.  I didn&#x27;t buy the set for the case, I just wanted the variety of brushes.</li>
    <li> great set of makeup brushes at a great cost. packaging had an odd chemical odor but after sitting out for a day all was good.</li>
    <li> I have always wanted to buy nice brushes but they can be so darn expensive for just one!  I was really nervous about buying these because they are so cheap! But after buying them I decided that cheap is the wrong word....they are inexpensive.  Inexpensive brushes that feel just like the brushes at Saphora (or pretty close at least) I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Really like these brushes - all of them seem to be good quality, none of them are losing their bristles and all are soft and feel great on the skin - with the variety of sizes, there&#x27;s a brush for anything you&#x27;d ever need  for putting makeup on - one of my favorites is a brush to use after putting on mascara to remove clumps and separate the lashes</li>
    <li> Great brushes, last long when taken care of.I would recommend them</li>
    <li> Did smell weird when first opened but I love the set.  There is a brush for any occasion and folds up well for putting in purses, bags, etc</li>
    <li> It smells really weird. I&#x27;ve aired it out and it still smell. Kind of cheap  material but I think it would be good for beginners</li>
    <li> the bag they came in (the outer gold bag) smells so bad like chemicals or moth balls. It was a good price and the brushes are high quality.</li>
