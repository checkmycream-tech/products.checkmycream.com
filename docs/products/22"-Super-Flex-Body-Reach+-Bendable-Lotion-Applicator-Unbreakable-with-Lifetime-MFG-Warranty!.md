### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect.</li>
      <li>The application pads and loofa pads are perfect.</li>
      <li>The adjustability is perfect.</li>
      <li>The reach is perfect.</li>
      <li>The wand is excellent reflecting great design.</li>
      <li>great tool for people who have to put cream on their backs</li>
      <li>A good &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34;...</li>
      <li>It is good</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t find it very easy to use but guess I need to practice with it more to get the hang of using this product.  </li>
      <li>I like the large applicator pads and the flex handle is great.</li>
      <li>Arrived safely.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>I would have better control of the wand.</li>
      <li>Need to use it longer and more often.</li>
      <li>short, VERY impressive LIFETIME product.</li>
      <li>This wand works wonderfully for its purpose and because it is bendable, works well with my limited range of motion.  </li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s nice to finally be able to lotion my own back.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery, package well, very satisfied.  </li>
      <li>The item spread the lotion around fine</li>
      <li>Not recommended by the manufacturer or probably any dermatologist, but when desperation strikes, the velcro attachment w/o the sponge is fine for a light scratching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The way it was made was fine and durable, easy to clean.</li>
      <li>Great to have, help a lot with putting lotion on you back</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a gadget that works this well for many years and am totally and completely satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>so this has helped tremendously.</li>
      <li>I chose this 22&amp;#34; super flex body reach due to lack of my own flexibility.  </li>
      <li>The handle seems to be solid but very light plastic.</li>
      <li>Performs exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>Very well made!</li>
      <li>The top grip seems unlined with the actual brush</li>
      <li>When this arrived the pad on the tip was lying exactly opposte the correct position, and the handle was bent backwards.</li>
      <li>OK, I haven&#x27;t had it that long, but I just don&#x27;t see how it can break.</li>
      <li>works fairly well but isn&#x27;t as flexable as I thought it would be hard to store.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>but the lotion sponge needs to be bigger and more flexible to do your back.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not perfect but it&#x27;s pretty darn good.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it yet with alcohol or other light liquids, but imagine it would be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have severe arthritis and live alone</li>
      <li>so evidently, this is not well suited for a short person.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Oh - without the sponge, it works pretty well as a back scratcher!</li>
      <li>It is not stiff enough to apply lotion beyond the lower shoulder.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used it three times so far.</li>
      <li>Apparently, an effort was made to follow the Gillette model and use sponges having a very short life and an attachment system that only worked with their sponges.</li>

<li> When you bend it for use, it holds long enough for applying lotion, but it will straighten somewhat, though not completely, between uses.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m now able to put moisturizer on my back which has been impossible.</li>
<li> I have been looking for something like this for a very long time.</li>
<li> And it is a little too long, I didn&#x27;t expect that to make a difference, but it twists just a little in my hand when trying to reach different areas of my back.</li>
<li> Probably more me being unfamiliar with the product than it being a bad design.</li>
<li> I note this only in case you are considering it for someone with weak arms who lives alone and needs a deep bend in the handle.</li>
<li> Other than that I like it.</li>
<li> I wasn&#x27;t wrong: this is very sturdy.</li>
<li> but I wish it was a little longer.</li>
<li> but thats just a little inconvenience.</li>
<li> Not great but somewhat easier then trying to reach your back with your hand.  </li>
<li> but it is very difficult to bend the wand and this reach the middle of your back.</li>
<li> Unfortunately they don&#x27;t (at this time) appear on the same Amazon listing, so just search BENDABLE BODY WAND to find another length.&lt;br</li>
<li> Handle is too small in diameter permitting rotation of wand.  </li>
<li> However, I found the application sponges and their attachment to the wand an abysmal failure!</li>
<li> I wish I would have purchased a shorter one, because it was difficult and floppy when trying to apply.</li>

    <li> Performs exactly as advertised. A good &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34;...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it three times so far. It works okay but the lotion sponge needs to be bigger and more flexible to do your back.</li>
    <li> Great to have, help a lot with putting lotion on you back</li>
    <li> Heaven on a handle when you have two-inch hives in the middle of your back in the middle of the night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very well built, heavy duty wand that comes in three lengths for persons with different levels of shoulder or hip mobility: 14\\&quot;, 18\\&quot; and 22\\&quot;. Unfortunately they don&#x27;t (at this time) appear on the same Amazon listing, so just search BENDABLE BODY WAND to find another length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The range of motion in my shoulders varies with flare-ups of arthritis, so I just ordered the longest. In photos it looked sturdy enough to last a lifetime, and I didn&#x27;t want to have to order another if my shoulder froze up again. I wasn&#x27;t wrong: this is very sturdy. The handle seems to be solid but very light plastic. When you bend it for use, it holds long enough for applying lotion, but it will straighten somewhat, though not completely, between uses. I note this only in case you are considering it for someone with weak arms who lives alone and needs a deep bend in the handle. Otherwise it&#x27;s not an issue. It also means you can straighten the bend as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As advertised, the sponge does not soak up your lotion or cream. I haven&#x27;t tried it yet with alcohol or other light liquids, but imagine it would be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh - without the sponge, it works pretty well as a back scratcher! Not recommended by the manufacturer or probably any dermatologist, but when desperation strikes, the velcro attachment w/o the sponge is fine for a light scratching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it comes with a velco dot that can be applied in such a way that you can wrap the sponge around the tip and use the wand for washing between toes. If someone&#x27;s mobility limitation prevents bending, this would do double duty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, VERY impressive LIFETIME product. OK, I haven&#x27;t had it that long, but I just don&#x27;t see how it can break. Very well made!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, package well, very satisfied.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This wand works wonderfully for its purpose and because it is bendable, works well with my limited range of motion.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The reach is perfect. The adjustability is perfect. The application pads and loofa pads are perfect. Handle was slippery especially with lotion/soap on hands so I wrapped a rubber band around the handle for traction. Perfect.</li>
    <li> Not great but somewhat easier then trying to reach your back with your hand.  Need to use it longer and more often.</li>
    <li> works fairly well but isn&#x27;t as flexable as I thought it would be hard to store.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have to struggle and hurt  my back to add lotion/sunscreen to my back and feet anymore, what a life saver.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I chose this 22&amp;#34; super flex body reach due to lack of my own flexibility.  I am short, 5&#x27;1 so evidently, this is not well suited for a short person. The bend in handle of the applicator handle tens to straighten out.  I wish I had ordered the shorter version.  I would not recommend this for a short person.</li>
    <li> I have not complaints on the product.  It works as advertised and is so simple to use.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone needing what it provides.</li>
    <li> This product is just as described. I like the large applicator pads and the flex handle is great. Will recommend</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t find it very easy to use but guess I need to practice with it more to get the hang of using this product.  Probably more me being unfamiliar with the product than it being a bad design.</li>
    <li> The wand is excellent reflecting great design. However, I found the application sponges and their attachment to the wand an abysmal failure! Apparently, an effort was made to follow the Gillette model and use sponges having a very short life and an attachment system that only worked with their sponges. I plan to replace their system with standard Velcro tape and use fabric applicators.</li>
    <li> great tool for people who have to put cream on their backs</li>
    <li> Before purchasing I contacted the company and asked if the product contained latex I was told there was NONE.  Well it does have latex so if you have an allergy AVOID this product.</li>
    <li> It is good but I wish it was a little longer.</li>
    <li> Will not hold its shape. It is not stiff enough to apply lotion beyond the lower shoulder.&lt;br /&gt;It does not replace another person.</li>
    <li> Just as described.  This product is just what the doctor ordered.I would recommed this product to others that can use it.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have purchased a shorter one, because it was difficult and floppy when trying to apply. I would have better control of the wand. The way it was made was fine and durable, easy to clean. Buying extra applicators recommended.</li>
    <li> Handle is too small in diameter permitting rotation of wand.  A claim is made that pad is non-absorbent, but there is a lot of medication which seems washed away when cleaning it.</li>
    <li> I have some issues with my hands, and wish the wand stayed bent. And it is a little too long, I didn&#x27;t expect that to make a difference, but it twists just a little in my hand when trying to reach different areas of my back.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a gadget that works this well for many years and am totally and completely satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it does. And it&#x27;s nice to finally be able to lotion my own back. The top grip seems unlined with the actual brush but thats just a little inconvenience. Other than that I like it.</li>
    <li> Arrived safely.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> The item spread the lotion around fine but it is very difficult to bend the wand and this reach the middle of your back.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. Just what I was looking for. I have been looking for something like this for a very long time.</li>
