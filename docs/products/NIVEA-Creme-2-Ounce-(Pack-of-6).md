      <li>but on my body Nivea is wonderful!!</li>
      <li>Very pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>Good creme!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I like this one better!</li>
      <li>Smells nice though.</li>
      <li>Good hand cream for winter  : )</li>
      <li>Very easy to carry around in purse or apply it on the go.</li>
      <li>I continue to use Nivea for severe sunburn or burns of any kind - and have not found a product that performs better.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t have been more thrilled with the results.</li>
      <li>Good product, can&#x27;t find the original anymore except online.</li>
      <li>Has a lot of body to it - more so than the jarred or bottled versions.</li>
      <li>After using the product for a couple of days I could tell that my skin looked smoother,was more supple and definately softer.</li>
      <li>Every time I think I&#x27;ve got all the water squeezed out and go to try to use it, there&#x27;s more.  </li>
      <li>I love Nivea and got the tubes</li>
      <li>Uses it mostly on his face, hands and legs.  </li>
      <li>My mom&#x27;s favorite creme</li>
      <li>To be honest, I&#x27;ve used both the Germany version(claim to be the original formula) and this one (made in Mexico).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best consistancey, and doesn&#x27;t dry up and get sticky.</li>
      <li>Yes, it has petrolatum inside, but it works to protect the creme from getting ripped off easily, so my hands are always moisturized.</li>
      <li>This is a FANTASTIC travel creme for hands, neck, etc.</li>
      <li>It is affordable and the results are definately worth it!</li>
      <li>Just the right size for her purse and work.</li>
      <li>And the price is very reasonable.</li>
      <li>Very convenient!  </li>
      <li>I have fair, dry, sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Really keeps his skin soft and smooth - no question about it.  </li>
      <li>I love Nivia, have used it on my dry face for years.</li>
      <li>and I think it moisturizes dry skin better than anything else.</li>
      <li>I use the the Nivea creme in a large jar but the creme in the tube feels thicker.  </li>
      <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s really impractical for traveling or using on the go.</li>
      <li>It really helps moisturize like nothing else...</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I really like this Nivea for my hands in the lab.  </li>
      <li>so I know very well what it should feel like.  </li>
      <li>Use it at work as a nurse, love the thick, non greasy moisturizing and the clean scent is great, not full of alcohol based perfumes that actually burn irritated dry hands.</li>
      <li>Recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>it normally comes in</li>
      <li>But I find it to be best working as a hand cream during the winter times when the air is cold and dry.</li>
      <li>I carry the tube version in my purse for my handcream, the large economy size tub for my face/body, and a smaller tin for travel size.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of this creme in the large tub</li>
      <li>There was so much scar tissue that I actually had to wear a size-larger shoe on that foot.  </li>
      <li>Now only able to find the small tubes that I can keep in my purse, at work, in my car, on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>So glad I found the same product in a small tube.</li>
      <li>After using the product as he directed, the scar tissue completely disappeared, leaving behind an area of smooth skin (that no longer tans!)</li>
      <li>Using this product is the only way my hands do not hurt from the frequent hand washing required.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s marketed here in the US as a &amp;#34;cold cream&amp;#34; type product, but the original thick cream - only the round blue jar or dark blue tube - is a product originally developed in Germany after WWII to treat radiation burns &amp; other severe skin injuries.  </li>

<li> My skin gets so dry during the winter months and need a very heavy moisture creme.  </li>

<li> It has saved my skin during these extremely cold winters in New England.  </li>
<li> Before finding it on Amazon, she was having a hard time finding the 2 oz.</li>
<li> I have kneaded those tubes like a mad baker trying to get it to blend back</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re looking for a quality lotion you can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very disappointed because I can&#x27;t use a single tube.  </li>
<li> Very bad quality</li>

    <li> Good creme! Not greasy!</li>
    <li> I have fair, dry, sensitive skin. I have tried every type of facial moisturizer/cream on the market. My grandmother used Nivea on her skin, her complexion looked great even at the age of 93! I decided why not give it a go, what have I got to loose? After using the product for a couple of days I could tell that my skin looked smoother,was more supple and definately softer. I also use this cream for my body lotion. One thing to be forwarned about: A little Nivea cream goes a long way,so use it sparingly. I carry the tube version in my purse for my handcream, the large economy size tub for my face/body, and a smaller tin for travel size. Nivea can be purchased at your local discount store, pharmacy or on the web. It is affordable and the results are definately worth it!</li>
    <li> Finally found this Nivea creme in a tube. Very easy to carry around in purse or apply it on the go. My mom&#x27;s favorite creme and I ordered a lot for her! She uses it on her face, hands and arms. But I find it to be best working as a hand cream during the winter times when the air is cold and dry. To be honest, I&#x27;ve used both the Germany version(claim to be the original formula) and this one (made in Mexico). I like this one better! Yes, it has petrolatum inside, but it works to protect the creme from getting ripped off easily, so my hands are always moisturized. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love Nivia, have used it on my dry face for years. It&#x27;s the best consistancey, and doesn&#x27;t dry up and get sticky. Good product, can&#x27;t find the original anymore except online.</li>
    <li> I love Nivea and got the tubes so I wouldn&#x27;t get the creme under my nails as I do with the jars, but getting the creme out of the tubes is work.  I&#x27;ll have to find another way to apply my Nivea in future.</li>
    <li> Use it at work as a nurse, love the thick, non greasy moisturizing and the clean scent is great, not full of alcohol based perfumes that actually burn irritated dry hands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this creme in the large tub it normally comes in but it&#x27;s really impractical for traveling or using on the go. So glad I found the same product in a small tube. This is thicker than any other lotion I&#x27;ve used and I think it moisturizes dry skin better than anything else. And the price is very reasonable. If you&#x27;re looking for a quality lotion you can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  Wife loves it.  Just the right size for her purse and work.</li>
    <li> Does not rub in all the way. Kinda just sits on the skin. Smells nice though.</li>
    <li> German-born hubby uses this all the time and LOVES it.  Really keeps his skin soft and smooth - no question about it.  Uses it mostly on his face, hands and legs.  Very pleasant scent. Has a lot of body to it - more so than the jarred or bottled versions.</li>
    <li> I use the the Nivea creme in a large jar but the creme in the tube feels thicker.  I use creme de la Mer on my face ($285 for 2oz!!) but on my body Nivea is wonderful!! I was using  Kiehl&#x27;s body lotion but after trying Nivea creme, I no longer have to spend $$ on body lotion! Now I need to find a bargain face cream!</li>
    <li> I use Nivea Creme all the time so I know very well what it should feel like.  ALL 6 tubes were jacked up.  The stuff inside is separated. There is a heavily perfumed water on the top and a thick cream underneath.  I have kneaded those tubes like a mad baker trying to get it to blend back so it&#x27;s usable but it doesn&#x27;t work - it just squishes around in there and stays separated.  I&#x27;m very disappointed because I can&#x27;t use a single tube.  Every time I think I&#x27;ve got all the water squeezed out and go to try to use it, there&#x27;s more.  Very bad quality and I&#x27;m not going to waste my time returning them all, they just went in the trash.</li>
    <li> The product was excellent- but the price was average. The same product could be purchased individually at a local for the same price.</li>
    <li> This is a FANTASTIC travel creme for hands, neck, etc. especially on transatlantic flights.  Best of all, the tubes conform to the &lt;3oz security rules!</li>
    <li> I have used this hand cream for over 5 years.  Now only able to find the small tubes that I can keep in my purse, at work, in my car, on Amazon.  Recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s marketed here in the US as a &amp;#34;cold cream&amp;#34; type product, but the original thick cream - only the round blue jar or dark blue tube - is a product originally developed in Germany after WWII to treat radiation burns &amp; other severe skin injuries.  It as recommended to me 20 year ago by my corporate physician when I developed a terrible build-up of scar tissue on the top of my foot do to an injury that was continually re-opened, and continually re-healing.  There was so much scar tissue that I actually had to wear a size-larger shoe on that foot.  He suggested I liberally apply Nivea 3 times a day until I noticed improvement. I remember doing this for about a month.  After using the product as he directed, the scar tissue completely disappeared, leaving behind an area of smooth skin (that no longer tans!) I couldn&#x27;t have been more thrilled with the results.It was over 20 years ago.  I continue to use Nivea for severe sunburn or burns of any kind - and have not found a product that performs better.  It is difficult to find the original in retail stores, but Amazon can usually find it for me.</li>
    <li> My skin gets so dry during the winter months and need a very heavy moisture creme.  I like the squeeze tubes and the 2 oz. size is perfect.  I place one in the car, in the bathroom, in my bedroom, in my purse.  Very convenient!  It really helps moisturize like nothing else... what dry skin?  It has saved my skin during these extremely cold winters in New England.  I love it!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product. Before finding it on Amazon, she was having a hard time finding the 2 oz. tubes.</li>
    <li> I really like this Nivea for my hands in the lab.  Using this product is the only way my hands do not hurt from the frequent hand washing required.</li>
    <li> Good hand cream for winter  : )</li>
