<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Confortable and easy to use.</li>
    <li> While this product performed beautifully, making the size curl I needed while keeping my hair from slipping on the bore, it only worked three times. Had it not stopped working, it would have been an unbelievably helpful tool. When I tried to rate  it only two stars, but definer came up as &amp;#34;Hated It!&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t hate it; I hate the fact it stopped working.</li>
    <li> The product is just I needed.  I can curl and blow dry damp hair at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;I could never use those hot curling irons. Heats quickly has tangle free button.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product.  Price was good.  Shipping speedy.</li>
    <li> I returned it as the plug was not compatible with British sockets or adaptors. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this hot air brush with the hopes that it would work not only as a blow dryer but also a curling iron.  I had rotator cuff surgery and could not lift my arm to do my hair so I thought this product would help with that problem by using my good arm to do my hair.  My hair is very fine and short but the brush was a bit too big to give me a decent curl.  Perhaps if it got hotter and was more like a curling iron, it might have worked.  It also did not produce enough hot air to dry my hair.  I had to partially blow dry my hair first and then attempt to use this to style my hair.  The concept for this hot air brush is a good one, it is just not powerful enough.  Overall, I was disappointed in this product and would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. After blow drying, use this to finish &amp; it gives your hair a nice shine.</li>
    <li> Dryer turned on, except the barrel end tip kept swiveling &amp; cap could not be tightened. Next morning the switch was loose then would not turn on at ALL.So I never even got to use it. And to make matters worse the box it came with was thrown out &amp; can&#x27;t return without it. $25.00 down the toilet.I&#x27;m not happy at all. I&#x27;ve used Helen of Troy before without problems but this one is  JUNK</li>
    <li> I have used this type of hair dryer/curler for years and when my last one died (different brand) I couldn&#x27;t find another.  I tried one that didn&#x27;t work right and had to be sent back.  This from Helen of Troy is perfect.  It dries and gives some lift and curl without looking \\&quot;set\\&quot;.  Easier to use than having a brush in one hand and a dryer in the other and everything is done in one process.</li>
    <li> good seller. The dryer works well as a styler. Not intended to dry completely wet hair. You must get it mostly dry and then use this to style. Works much better than a curling iron because it adds body and the curl tends to stay longer.</li>
    <li> I have had a few of these and have always been happy with them over the years. However, this one must have a loose part in it because it rattles when you turn it on and makes a high pitch sound. Annoying!</li>
    <li> Does not get hot enough for a lasting wave.  Adequate but I expect the heating element to weaken.</li>
    <li> I have the straightest hair and it goes me body and curls if I want them. Amazing, wasn&#x27;t sure it would work but it does</li>
    <li> I just got this product and am so excited with the results.  My hair is fine and short and needs body.  This is just what I wanted.  The results are full, textured hair and done so quickly too!  I can even touch up my bed hair the next day and get the same fresh styled look.  Quick, easy, does it get any better than that?</li>
    <li> This is a very handy tool for someone looking to dry and curl their hair.  I don&#x27;t have the coordination and strength to use a hair dryer and brush to style my hair so this is ideal.  My hair is short so the 3/4\\&quot; is perfect but it also comes in 1\\&quot; and 1 1/2\\&quot; barrel sizes.</li>
    <li> WOW!This is not for me at all!I have long,fine hair and thought this Hot Air brush would give me nice waves...Tangle free?!Yeah right! I used this on 3 different occasions thinking if I did something different I would get better results,instead my hair got tangled in this every single time!And it was almost impossible to get out.This would probably work if you have short to medium hair,but if you have long hair I would recommend staying away from this.I am going to give this to a friend since it has no use for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an identical item that I&#x27;d had for many years.  It is just perfect for my fine, wavy hair that likes to wave in the wrong places sometimes.  I keep another one in our RV for when we travel.  I was so happy that it still is available, an excellent product!</li>
    <li> This item was sold as new but came with an additional overwrap like possibly it was not new. It heats up very quickly, then won&#x27;t go back on for a few minutes. Playing with it, I think it has a faulty switch. I have a feeling I was sent someone elses reject. If it wasn&#x27;t for the time &amp; cost, I would return it.</li>
    <li> Other than hair about 4-6 inches tending to get tangled in the teeth, it does the job.</li>
    <li> I love this product, have used the Helen of Troy Hot Air brush for years, I needed a new one after my old one was wearing out. I was excited to find it here, and I ordered two. The older ones didn&#x27;t have the softer brush, these do. Love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair. I was looking for a curling iron with tangle free, ceramic combs to replace the one I have which has been discontinued.  I decided to try this product and was pleased with the results.  It does hold the hair in place while drying so this eliminates blow drying then curling. The release button works great for tangle free.  If there is anything I would like to change perhaps I would like for the temperature to get a little hotter.  My hair is thick and course so I have to hold in position for a long time to dry and control the curl. But I would recommend this product to anyone looking for curl control as well as a styling tool.  It is light weight and easy to handle.  Good quality</li>
    <li> PURCHASED AS A GIFT BUT HAVE ONE. I LIKE IT, IT WORKS WELL FOR ME. WOULD RECOMMEND VERY HIGHLY AGAIN.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful hot air brush.  I stumbled upon this Helen of Troy site some years ago when I could no longer purchase a hot air brush locally.  I ordered two.  After using the first one for about two years, it died a natural death and I started using the second one.  Now I have ordered another...just to have one on hand always.</li>
    <li> I have used this type of curler/dryer for years now and my brush just broke apart because it was about 15 years old. I still have the motor and it works great but can&#x27;t buy just the brush. this unit is soft on my hands and is perfect. If you have never used a curling brush, you are in for a treat. Curls your hair and doesn&#x27;t leave bumps where the curling iron does. You can blend your hair all together with this air brush curler. No need for a curling iron. I don&#x27;t use it to dry my hair because that is too cumbersome, use only on almost dry or dry hair for a quick curl and beautiful do. I like the 3/4\\&quot; instead of the 1\\&quot; because my hair is short. Takes about 3 minutes and it&#x27;s done! love this system. Totally recommend</li>
    <li> I bought this after getting a recommendation from a friend.  It works great.  Just enough curl, without the \\&quot;fixed\\&quot; look of a curling iron.  Easy to use and quick!</li>
    <li> I will not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I use it on damp hair to style.  I use it on dry hair to add body.</li>
    <li> Love this brush, does everything I hoped for.  I semi dry my hair then use the brush to style.  Easy touch up second day.</li>
    <li> I have been using hot air curling brushes for years.  Liberated me from old fashion curlers.  Had the 1\\&quot; but like to keep my hair short.  This 3/4\\&quot; barrel makes my life so much easier in trying to tame the frizzies and define my curls.  Hope they never stop making them.  I even take it with me to the hair salon!</li>
    <li> I have straight, white, thin hair- I can get back to having some control over the style.  Just love this hot air brush.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> my hair is very fine and falling out. Still I want to look my best, I have tried the type that is like a hair brush, but it pulls my hair out, this one has a plastic bush that doen&#x27;t pull the hair.</li>
    <li> I had looked all over for a hot air brush to replace my beloved Sassoon hot air brush that finally gave out after 5 years.  I wanted a brush type with plastic teeth, not the bristles which break my hair off.  I wanted hot air so I could dry my hair while styling it.  I wanted a hot air brush that didn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.  Well, I found the answer to all my wants with the HELEN OF TROY Hot Air Brush 3/4 inch Tangle Free.  It is even more light weight than my previous air brush.  It has a powerful enough motor to dry my short to mid-length shag-cut hair.  I had never heard of this particular brand, but I am so very, very glad that I went ahead and ordered this.  For a reasonable price, I now have a wonderful replacement that I love even better than my Sassoon!!  I am so glad that I finely decided to try Amazon.com before buying a second-rate curling iron that didn&#x27;t do what I wanted it to do.  Thank you Amazon.com for having exactly what I wanted!!</li>
    <li> I have used this as a dryer and styler when my hair was very short, now that I am growing it out, its easier to blow dry my hair with my regular dryer till hair is damp. Then style it. I do have to say you must hold it im place a few seconds for curl or wave.  It is used a little different than a curling iron, you hold it against the roots and turn the styler to wind hair then hold for a few seconds. I think it is alot easier than a curling iron, plus you dont burn yourself.</li>
    <li> This is my second Helen of Troy hot air brush, and I have to say I liked the first one better.  Haven&#x27;t figured out what&#x27;s different about this one, but I don&#x27;t get the same results.  Maybe I just have to get used to it.</li>
    <li> so great, easy to use...my hair is soft and has big fluffy curls or nicely thick..buy it you will love it too</li>
    <li> This is the best hot air brush I have ever used, I have two sizes, 3/4in and 1 in. It is easy to handle and tangle-free. The wand is easily removed for cleaning. It saves me time and effort styling my hair.</li>
    <li> Great product; I use it every day! Can&#x27;t get along without it! works better than the last brand I purchased! Will NOT disappoint... :)</li>
    <li> I like the long flexable ponts on the barrel. I have used this air brush for many years. I find it difficult to find the 3/4 barrel in stores. Was pleased to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Allows me to dry and brush style at once with just one hand.  It is great with my short hair.  My hair Is dried and styled in minutes.  This is the second one I have owned. The last one lasted for years.</li>
    <li> I wear a pixie cut. I have thin, fine hair with some body. I was the only girl and didn&#x27;t really learn how to use hair appliances properly. I watch other people and try from example, yea right. Kinks from curling irons, Uneven bangs using a blow dryer no matter how many times I re-wet my hair. This hot air brush is FANTASTIC. I just picked it up and tried it and voila!!!! even curled under bangs every time. Plus in-between hair cuts it helps to put some body in, maybe a little lift, or however you want to style your hair. You can not go wrong with this Hot Air Brush.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but wish it also came in a 1/2&amp;#34; size.  My hair is short so I could really use that size.</li>
    <li> I have short hair and the 3/4&amp;#34; barrel works better for me than the 1&amp;#34;.  It dries my hair and gives me poof at the same time.  I have bought it before and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is the very BEST hairstyler and hair dryer in one! I have very fine, thick, shoulder lenght hair and was a little skeptical that this product would be usefull for me. It is! Actually it is the best hair styling product I have ever purchased. It dries and sets my hair very quickly, usually in five minutes or less. What a timesaver. I am so delighted with this product that I purchased eight (8) to keep in my closet so I don&#x27;t have to hunt for the best product EVER!!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!.  It&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve ever found for easily curling fine hair.  The 3/4&amp;#34; barrel size has been difficult to find in stores, so I was glad to locate it on Amazon.  Five stars for sure!</li>
    <li> Since my hair is short this is the perfect size for my hair. I am a older person who finds it hard to handle hair dryer and brush to do my hair this is the perfect size to dry and style my hair. Hard to find smaller sizes in store.</li>
    <li> Works perfect for fine hair, doesn&#x27;t over curl.  Blow dry first then use the&lt;br /&gt;Brush to style to specific curl you like</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush because I have short hair and the 3/4 &amp;#34; brush is very easy to use. One time I let my hair air dry before using the brush, and found it was very effective on the dry hair as well as the wet hair. I now use it mostly on hair that is dry and combed into the style I want, then apply the dry brush to add fluff and shape. I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Was so thankful to get it.  Shipment was prompt, as usual.  Use it almost every day, it is great for daily restyling.  Can you believe WalMart dd not have it on the shelf.  So shop on Amazon, they are reliable, affordable, and you can count on them.  MERRY CHRISTMAS</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. I currently have two as I don&#x27;t want to be without if the product is discontinued.</li>
    <li> I like this product and it reminds me of something I had 40 years ago. The only thing bad I can say about it, is that my hair is thin and fine so it works OK on it.  If you have thicker hair I would say it would take hours to dry your hair.  It could use a few more amps.</li>
    <li> Love it, as it is so easy to use. It does a great job on my hair. Would recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> My Mom had bought one of these &amp; really liked it so I decided I wanted one.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived approx. 3 days after I ordered it. Good-bye, blow dryer!</li>
    <li> I just received my third hot air brush made by Helen of Troy.  I have two in different sizes depending on how long my hair is at the time.  I completely wore out the first one after about 3 years of daily use.  The dryer was still functioning but the plastic teeth surrounding it finally gave up.  I just love this product and can happily recommend it to anyone who wants a good quick hair do with this amazing air brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several of these and they are a great styling tool.  I haven&#x27;t used this one yet, because the previous one is still working.  But it got awfully hot a couple of times, which usually means it&#x27;s about to burn itself out.  That&#x27;s the only problem with these, a not so perfect thermostat.</li>
    <li> not like my old one...does not seem to be as well built....curls hair different too</li>
    <li> Works okay but can be hotter to help set the curl better.  It does get tangled in the hair and the button does not work</li>
    <li> This is a great air brush. My hair is on the short side and use the brush on damp hair and it does a great job to dry and curl it and also use it on dry hair.</li>
    <li> I love this brush the only thing I use for styling my hair.</li>
    <li> everyone was in perfect condition</li>
    <li> I like the Helen of Troy for styling my hair. I love this brush. I have been using this for years.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a client and she brought it back to me and said it worked for a couple of days using it and then she went to use it again and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on, bummed and upset this happened.</li>
    <li> Beautifully designed, easy to handle BUT power is severely lacking.  Would take an hour to actually dry even slightly damp short hair with this device.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this product and it works great on short hair!  I use it every day and love the convenience of a round, tangle-free brush and hair dryer in one hand!</li>
    <li> Yes this was exactly what I was wanting for my personnel care product.&lt;br /&gt;It has worked well to my satisfaction.</li>
    <li> First of all, it does not unlock my hair each time~~~so I have to unplug and work the hair out of the teeth of the roller!!!  My hair is not long, at all, so I am VERY disappointed.  There was no instructions as to how and where to send it back~~no invoice in the box. This is the FIRST EVER item that I have ordered through AMAZON that has REALLY disappointed me.  I will continue to order through Amazon, as I usually find the best prices.  But I will definitely not order from this vendor.</li>
    <li> I love these Helen of troy hot air brush. I have one of every size. They are easy on the hair but curl it nice</li>
    <li> This one didn&#x27;t work and I didn&#x27;t bother sending it back. I thought for sure it was too twirl...I did get a better one...</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mom and she mentioned that it kept getting stuck in her hair. She had a stroke and has to use one hand to dry her hair, so this constantly getting tangled in her hair was no help. I went back and ordered the 3/4 inch John Frieda and we have no issues. The &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; on this dryer is not the same as the John Frieda. It may be okay for those without physical challenges, but it didn&#x27;t work for our needs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really excited about this Product. It was my 3rd try for an item like this. I was disappointed with similar items but love this Brush very much. It does the job I expected it to do.</li>
    <li> I cant travel without it. So practical, it s a must have.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron. It&#x27;s the second one I&#x27;ve purchased the other one lasted for years.  I have lightly curly hair so after I partialy dry hair with a blow dryer it works great to put light curls where I want them.</li>
    <li> i am still getting the hang of this curler...never been handy with them. always seem to come out looking like Farrah&#x27;s gawky little sister or something lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but i like this a lot. i have fine medium length hair and (as my sister instructed me to do for best results) i dry my hair with a blow dryer, and use this to curl and give body. The waves i get last all day and it doesnt tangle my hair as long as im careful, and also use the release.</li>
    <li> Does the job I expected.  Nice loose curls from damp hair.  Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this for anyone! It works great on curling the hair and it smooths it out too along with drying it.</li>
    <li> Helen of Troy iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did not work at all. I had tried one a friend had and it did well. This didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;Seem to warm enough on high. If I had kept the box I would have sent it back. I did try it several times and followed instructions.</li>
    <li> I have used this and sold several  in my beauty salon for years and love it-don&#x27;t like that when it gets older and hot it turns itself off-but guess that is a safety feature--Amazon is the ONLY resource for the 3/4 inch size--</li>
    <li> This is the fifth Helen of Troy 3/4 Rotating hot Air Brush that I bought for a Gift for long hair and short hair use. I have one myself, some other brand when grab hair in the roller, the hair didn&#x27;t stay inside the roll, always fall, but Helen of Troy brand, hair rolling in the air brush and stay so you can roll easily. Good for people that loose lots of hair. Air brush is better than blow dry.</li>
    <li> handle a little fat but does the job</li>
    <li> This is my second airbrush of this model.  I&#x27;m still using the old one, but it overheats so ordered a new one, for when the old one bites the dust.  It works very well and the old one has been around a while.  I would like to order another one in a bigger size barrel.</li>
    <li> I really love this brush. I&#x27;ve been searching for something like this awhile. It does tangle sometimes - I had to rip a bunch of hair out a few times. But, my hair is extremely curly. Smoother hair will have no trouble!</li>
    <li> The first one didn&#x27;t work, and I returned it to the company.&lt;br /&gt;The second one is working .</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly.  Works great!  Never had one like this before.  Love it!  I have very short hair and the 3/4&amp;#34; size is perfect.</li>
    <li> Product is great. I have had several other hot air brushes of different brands and this one is the best. Bristles are longer and grab hair for much easier styling and volume. Love it!</li>
    <li> Dries &amp; styles. Hair doesn&#x27;t tangle! Styles or straightens. Long cord. Shipment came fast.would work on thick or fine hair. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> For Christmas, I was given the Helen of Troy curling iron with the 1&amp;#34; barrel.  It worked perfectly, but the barrel was a little bit too large for me, so I purchased the 3/4&amp;#34; barrel iron.  Unfortunately, this item keeps shutting itself off when it is lifted into curling position.  Luckily for me, I still had the 1&amp;#34; iron, so I switched the barrels and now have one complete (working) iron.  I would suggest that you sell these irons in the future with both barrels so that a person would not have to spend double the money and wind up with only one machine.</li>
    <li> This is my second one of these.  It does what it says it will do.  Prompt shipping</li>
    <li> So far it has worked pretty well styling my hair.  I like the size, 3/4 inch, for my short, fine hair.  I hope it will work for several years.</li>
    <li> Just tried it for the first time and very happy with the results.  I have VERY fine hair that is hard to style.  This brush picked up all of my layers and gave me more volume than I&#x27;ve been able to achieve with other types of stylers.  Just be careful if you get the 3/4\\&quot; barrel as it catches in my hair if I put too much into it.  I had a 1\\&quot; before and it didn&#x27;t do that.  I like the extra lift with the 3/4\\&quot; versus a 1\\&quot;, so this is a \\&quot;keeper\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this brush served as a dryer as well--it is a good product.  It was not what I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for years but recently I cut my hair short so I needed a smaller barrel than the 1&amp;#34; I already had and this one works great.  Also while reading all the posts before I purchased this unit I learned that you can take the end cap off (where the cord goes into the unit) and clean the dust out of there.  My old one kept on overheating so I tried that and it works again great.  Just an FYI.....</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a 3/4 inch hot air brush and finally found this one on Amazon.  Hadn&#x27;t tried this brand before and was a bit nervous because it was so inexpensive.  But it turned out to be a great brush.  It doesn&#x27;t get tangled up in my fine medium length hair and dries it quickly without damaging it.  I definitely recommend this brush for those who need a smaller diameter brush!!</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this new replacement for a former version of the curling dryer.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in excellent condtion</li>
    <li> I purchased this right before going on a trip because I hated packing a hair dryer and a curling iron.  My hair dresser actually recommened this bacause I was burning my hair with the curling iron.  Once I got the hang of it I really liked it.  I have packed away my hair dryer and curling iron.  I actually purchased two so I would have a back up.  I would recommend to anyone.  I really like it alot.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, especially on short hairdo&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Did not know such an item existed until online research.  Sounded like a great accessory &amp; decided to try it. Still getting used to it, but like it a lot.  Not to be used solely as a hair dryer, but when finishing up with my short hair it helps to &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; and blend in areas . I think it will often replace my curling iron, though I believe that, a good dryer &amp; this air brush are all necessary.  Think it will be great for touch ups--glad I found it!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I have beautiful curls or lost of body when using this hot air brush. I have short hair and it is quick and easy and my hair dries smooth, shinny and  fast without burning or frizz. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This brush is perfect to use for my fine hair.  Does a nice job of curling.  I would recommend it for anyone who has a shorter hair style.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the job it does, can&#x27;t find any better product.  I have to purchase several brushes at a time because&lt;br /&gt;when you turn it off for a bit and go back to it,  the brush will not come back on.  In order to finish fixing my hair I have to&lt;br /&gt;find an old one that had stopped working, plug it on and ta da it will come back on after it has had its rest. When you are on a time schedule it is inconvenient!</li>
    <li> This was an excellent purchase! I have short-medium baby-fine hair that is very sensitive to heat and chemicals, and this curling brush has done a very nice job. I am able to use the brush on the higher heat and have not noticed any damage to my hair. The air flow is very comfortable to work with and my hair dries very quickly. My one con for the brush is that my hair will tangle on the brush if I wind it too tightly, and the curl release is probably only about 50% effective. I&#x27;ve just learned how to handle the brush and it&#x27;s really not much of a problem. I would definitely buy this item again!</li>
    <li> I have very short hair, and although it&#x27;s the narrowest I could find, it&#x27;s really hardly usable on most of my hair.</li>
    <li> Exactly as ordered.  This worked out fine.  I would recommend to anyone in the market for a hair care product.</li>
    <li> If you have fine hair, be careful with this. My husband had to help me get it out of my hair. No power. Takes forever to dry.</li>
    <li> not what i thought it was... i was looking for something more like a curling iron. It&#x27;s okay for touch ups, but not for wet or nappy hair... hair must be blown out and straighten before hand.</li>
    <li> I have used this for over a year and love it. It works great, gives a lot of body to my hair. I either let my hair air dry for awhile, as I have thick hair, or partially dry it with my blow dryer, then use this. I an so happy that I have 3 sizes, 3/4\\&quot;, 1\\&quot;, &amp; 1.5\\&quot; as my hair is layered. I just bought my mom a 1\\&quot; for her birthday and she is thrilled.</li>
    <li> Mine only lasted a few manths and then fell to pieces in a way that could not be put back together again.  At it&#x27;s best it was not so good; weak air flow, jerky brush roll and slow drying.I loved the idea but not execution.</li>
    <li> I first purchased at a retail store. when I was unable to find a replacment locally but searched the internet. Made a purchase, still very happy. Recently I decided to purchase again so that when this one does need to be replaced, I would already have one on hand. And because I was thinking ahead, I purchased two. So all total that would be four that I have purchased. Summary, used one until needed replacing, currently using the second purchase and have 2 on reserve.</li>
    <li> This hot air brush is very easy to use!  My hair is pretty short and I could not find a hot air brush&lt;br /&gt;at the store with this small of a barrel.  I love my brush!  Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Works fine but burn out and melt after a couple of years, usually I purchase two at a time, because this unit works the best for my wife who does her hair every other day</li>
    <li> I have fine short hair yet this still managed to grab my hair and tangle it.  The release button does not rotate enough to release the curl. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> Works very well for my fine, short hair.</li>
    <li> This Helen of Troy 3/4&amp;#34; Rotating Hot Air Brush is very easy to use and does a great job on my hair. It is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> All I wanted was a simple hot air curling brush. Notice I said SIMPLE. Helen of Troy has it so now I can retire my old, old one. It is just what I wanted and needed for a resonable price.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  I have short, fine hair and it does a great job.  I like the rubber tipped bristles, doesn&#x27;t hurt my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added on 6/18/13: I have to reduce my rating from 5 stars to one star.  The hair dryer stopped working this morning.  Barely lasted 2 months.  Not a good buy.</li>
