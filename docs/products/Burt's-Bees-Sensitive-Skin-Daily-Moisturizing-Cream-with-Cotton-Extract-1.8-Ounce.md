<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product. A little goes a long way. Not greasy, absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t feel like a layer on top of my skin. No irritation or overwhelming scent. Doesn&#x27;t smell like anything really. Works great on my sensitive yet acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Use to use Cetaphil until my skin started having a bad reaction to it. Decided to try the Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Skin product line. My skin has never looked this great!</li>
    <li> Our daughter says she likes it and it works well. So I guess that all can be said. It&#x27;s a little pricey.</li>
    <li> And while I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, I am feeling that as I get a little more mature, I need to be a little kinder to my face. After all the products I use on my face in a daily manner, making sure my skin is well-cared-for has become an increasing concern. Little wrinkles, fine lines, sometimes a just taught-skin feeling like it&#x27;s been a little too much today (or yesterday). This creme is formulated for sensitive skin, but works on all skin types. It&#x27;s light, non-greasy, paraben free (which is important to me), is not animal tested (stopped using certain brands because of that), and is made with 99% natural products it lists for you in detail on the side. My skin relaxes after an application of this light creme; it&#x27;s soaked in like it was a natural part of the body - your face wants this! And none of the greasy residue or having to wait ten minutes for absorption. Occasional dry patches on my skin are quickly treated with this moisturizer, but I never get that over-used zit-factory response to some heavier cremes. It&#x27;s not blocking my pores - it&#x27;s melting into my skin. This is a brand i swear by over more expensive, better known name brands; not just because it&#x27;s natural, but because it works with your body, and doesn&#x27;t go to work ON your body. It doesn&#x27;t feel foreign on the skin, it doesn&#x27;t feel like a &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34;, it feels like just adding more of my natural beauty to shine out. Go natural and see the difference. FEEL the difference. It&#x27;s immediate, and you&#x27;ll see results soon.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Daily Moisturizing Cream is like it proposal ,I use it for my baby,and just so so,that is all</li>
    <li> I bought this product to substitute Aveda botanic kinetics hydrating lotion which is much more expensive, I thought might as well give this one a try since its burts bees, but apparently this product can not provide sufficient hydrating power for my extremely dry mouth area, but I&#x27;ve found out that it works pretty well applied together with Vaseline Cocoa Butter Petroleum Jelly, so I assume it&#x27;s just not enough oil in itself.</li>
    <li> My favorite face cream.</li>
    <li> As listed on the Burt&#x27;s Bees website, this product contains phenoxyethanol, a dangerous preservative that can cause cell mutation when exposed in large quantities. In fact, most of their new items contain this chemical, including the Radiant and Ageless lines. I find it a bit too much myself, that they tout a healthy and organic image and then place ingredients worse than parabens in their products. Unfortunately, most \\&quot;organic\\&quot; companies do the same.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Skin Daily Moisturizing Cream as part of a BzzCampaign.  I was excited to try it out since I have been a big fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm for years.  The moisturizer has a great texture.  Not too heavy.  I love that it is designed for sensitive skin as my skin is quite sensitive.  Though I am in remission, I have psoriasis, and have to be cautious to use gentle products on my skin.  My skin has a tendency to dry out throughout the day, but this moisturizer kept it feeling moist but not oily all day.  It has a nice light scent, that is not perfumey at all.  I only give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I prefer my moisturizer to have SPF.  This one will be great for days spent mostly indoors or during the rainy season, though.  I would confidently recommend this product to others with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know I had sensitive skin until a visit to the dermatologist determined that I had acute dermatitis (a condition where your skin suddenly becomes red, itchy, dry, and peeling). My dermatologist recommended I change my bodywash to something for sensitive skin since the one I was using was harsh and could be the reason for the breakout. A few days ago, I had another dermatitis break out on my neck area. It was extremely itchy (more itchier than mosquito bites), little bumps were forming, and my skin was peeling and red in the span of one day! I suspect it was because i was using a harsh toner on my jawline during the previous few days to get rid of some acne and that action might have caused my skin to fight back with dermatitis. Ugh! So I decided to switch to Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Skin Solutions for Sensitive Skin and see how well it would work for my skin condition. I am a BzzAgent and had signed up to try a sample of this product which came just in time. The moisturizer I would give four stars. It really helped soothe my neck&#x27;s inflamed and itchy skin condition. I especially like the pump design on the moisturizer. You just press and hold the button and moisturizer will keep coming out until you let go. The texture of the moisturizer is smooth and thick but not as thick as the cleanser. My face felt moderately moisturized. I don&#x27;t think it would be an adequate moisturizer for extremely dry climates like winter though. It did calm my dermatitis skin condition and stopped the itching after I applied it which I am so happy about. I would approve the moisturizer for sensitive skin people.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. In just a couple of days my skin is softer, plumper and smoother. This is a wonderful moisturizer. However, I do have 3 cautions.    1.When I remove my makeup at night I use a pre-moistened towelette; Biore. I remove my makeup, wipe my face with a damp cloth and use moisturizer. When I did this my face DID get very red. I looked sunburned. The next time I removed my make up and used this moisturizer I I let my face dry first, and this time my face DID NOT get red. So be warned that mixing this with other products may irritate your skin.   2. No where on the box/bottle does it state that it contains SPF. I use foundation with SPF so I do not worry about sunscreen. You may need to apply a separate sunscreen; just beware of my first caution.   3. The box claims to be 99% natural. I do not know what the 1% contains but if you are a strict Vegan or very concerned about additives you may want to contact the company for more information.  These 3 cautions do NOT prohibit me for highly recommending this product. My skin hasn&#x27;t looked so smooth and clear for years.  Disclaimer: I am a bzzagent and I have been given this product by the company to review this product and give an honest  opinion based on my everyday experience. This way interested buyers can have a  detailed description of its long term use. I do not receive any monetary compensation for my review.</li>
    <li> I received this product as a sample from bzzagent. I have been using this product for  over a week now and it is a really nice product. It has not irritated my sensitive skin and I have noticed that my skin tone looks quite even as a result. I&#x27;ve noticed that other reviewers were bothered by the scent but I found it to be a subtle, pleasant scent although the product does not contain an actual fragrance. This particular moisturizer I think I would probably use more in the summer months as it does absorb pretty quickly. I usually need a heavier moisturizer during the winter months however the Burt&#x27;s Bees moisturizer still gave me good results when I used a good exfoliating product before application. I would recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin issues. Overall it is a great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I was given a sample of this product to review as a buzz agent. I loved the simple goodness of this moisturizer. It is all natural and did not cause my skin to sting and burn. It provided moisture for my skin all day long. I go without makeup alot and my skin was healthy and glowing while using the Sensitive Daily Moisturizing Cream. My brother in law usually cannot use a moisturizer because it will cause his face to become red and inflamed but he was able to use the Sensitive Daily Moisturizer with no redness at all!</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Skin Solutions for Sensitive Skin Daily Moisturizing Cream is a wonderful moisturizer for sensitive skin!  It is made with 99% natural ingredients and is fragrance-free.  This moisturizer has a really nice, light texture.  It goes on smoothly, absorbs well, and a little bit goes a long way.  It creates a really nice base for makeup application.  My skin looks and feels better since using this product!  And it&#x27;s so gentle that I&#x27;m not afraid to use it on my young daughter, which is a bonus!  The only thing stopping me from giving this product 5 stars is the absence of any sunscreen... a little SPF protection would make this a perfect product!  I received a complimentary sample of this product as a BzzAgent, but I&#x27;m now a paying customer!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product from Bzzagent, and I used it in combination with the cleanser from the same line. The bottom line is that I thought that it was a good product and the results were amazing: I LOVED the silky soft texture it gave to my skin! (I can&#x27;t stop touching my cheek...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also goes on light, and it moisturized my skin while leaving a radiant appearance that wasn&#x27;t greasy. It &#x27;sinks in&#x27; to the skin and doesn&#x27;t rub off (like some waxy natural moisturizers do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it for just one nitpicky reason: as the packaging claims, it is &#x27;99% natural&#x27;. I read the ingredient list and I don&#x27;t care for the sound of the other 1% (e.g., sodium benzoate, benzoic acid, phenoxyethanol). I&#x27;m not a chemist, and maybe they&#x27;re harmless..but they just don&#x27;t sound like something I want to put on my skin. While this is probably the nicest moisturizer I&#x27;ve used in terms of results, I want to find a moisturizer with the same results but a more appealing ingredient list. I haven&#x27;t settled yet...</li>
    <li> I love this light cream, great for my sensitive skin. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Not as moisturizing as others I have tried but as stated it does not irritate my sensitive skin and feels nice going on. Doesn&#x27;t absorb as quickly as other products I have tried. It&#x27;s just OK and I&#x27;ll probably just go back to my old standby, the Clinique Dramatically Different Lotion+.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin! After use my skin has been more balanced, neither oily or dry.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, this did not bother my skin (two stars).  But, it is not a cream (more of a lotion / less viscous) -- it was not moisturizing enough for me, in fact, it didn&#x27;t lubricate / soften my skin at all.  Will need to find something more emollient.</li>
    <li> I received Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive facial cleanser and daily moisturizing cream for review as a member of Buzzagent.  I was very surprised.  The Burt&#x27;s Bees sensitive skin products are all natural and made from cotton extract.  My face is very sensitive and I normally have red skin on my forehead as well as on my cheeks.  These products do not cause my face to turn red at all.  My skin is soft and not dry or oily after using this product.</li>
    <li> I recently received this product to try because I am a Bzz Agent. This product does exactly what it says it will do. It is a basic moisturizer that does not cause flare ups or reactions on people with sensitive skin. There is no added fragrance and it is absorbed quickly into the skin without leaving any stickiness or residue. It is a fairly light moisturizer, so I would not recommend it as a night cream. Personally, I will not continue to use this product because it does not contain SPF. I prefer that my moisturizers have a built in SPF rather than having to use a separate product. This is a very basic moisturizer with no added ingredients to fight acne, prevent oiliness or anything else. This makes it a great product for people with highly reactive skin that cannot tolerate anything harsher.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for the past 3 weeks and have really been loving it. The scent is so soft and clean that it&#x27;s barely there at all. I believe the scent is from the Cotton Extract.  My husband likes the lack of scent because he&#x27;s quite sensitive to them. The container is very fresh looking, and the pump lets me dispense just as much product as I need. There&#x27;s no SPF in this product, so I use this on the days that I know will be rainy or when I know I&#x27;ll be kept indoors. The consistency is closer to  a cream than a liquid and it gives me a nice moist, smooth base for applying my foundation. I would recommend this to just about anyone, and especially to men who may be bothered by flowery scents in a facial moisturizer. I received my bottle of Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Skin Daily Moisturizer from BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> I am a bzzagent and I received a full sized Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Sensitive Daily Moisturizing Cream with Cotton Extract for free to try out.  It has skin-friendly ingredients-from nature that include rice extract, which helps support cellular turnover and nourishes the skin. It has aloe which is famous for its emollient and moisturizing properties that helps soother skin.  Also included is Eyebright, which contains tannis which is thought to decrease inflammation. Finally, White Genepi, known for its anti-inflammatory properties.  It includes seven \\&quot;oligosaccharides\\&quot; or sugars that help improve the skin barrier, reduce the appearance of skin redness and increase the production of keratin. I did like the moisturizer more than I did the cleanser. It was lightweight and offered good coverage.  It did have the same clay like smell that the cleanser had which I didn&#x27;t mind. The moisturizer didn&#x27;t claim to be fragrance-free like the cleanser did which I guess is good because it does have a smell to it. The moisturizer did a good job of moisturizing my face with causing any redness or irritation. The moisturizer didn&#x27;t have as many claims to it as the cleanser did so you can&#x27;t really disprove or disagree with its claim. Overall this moisturizer seems to be a good product and does what it claims. It is available at mass retailers, drug stores, grocery stores and natural health food stores nationwide for about $14.99.</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers, I received Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Skin Daily Moisturizer free to try. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now. My face tends to break out easily with a lot of products but not with this one. My face has been clear and soft. The only negative that I see is that there is no SPF. Otherwise, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have hypersensitive skin and have cut out all sls and working on parabens. This was affordable, unlike most paraben free products and I love it :)</li>
    <li> It was delivered as promised. Nicely packaged. But unfortunately I only got a chance to use it once. When I opened the bottle, the cap came off with the nozzle and... well, now my walls and the sink are very well moisturized. I&#x27;m upset right now so this review is mostly venting. The cream itself feels nice, although it&#x27;s not easy to rub it in unless you take a very small amount.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t much to say other than I really love this moisturizer. I purchased this, to try something new, after my previous moisturizer (from Yes To Cucumbers) finished. And as much as I loved my previous moisturizer, I believe I love this one a tiny bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having sensitive skin makes it a challenge to really find good, gentle products that don&#x27;t have weird smells; and this product smells just fine and is very gentle on my skin. I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts since using this product (though I am sure the fact that I drink a lot of water has also helped with keeping my skin clear). So, I will definitely be repurchasing this product again once it runs out.</li>
    <li> I received my BuzzAgent kit last week and tried this product out. I am quite picky about my skin care products and I must say this was not too bad! My skin feels softer... who knew that cotton could be used in skin care (other than to apply product to that is). I would recommend this not only to sensitive skin people but anyone that wants to try something new with out the scare of a strange reaction. Good Job Burt&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> I bought this product about two weeks ago and I love it, it feels nice and soothing against my skin.</li>
    <li> I received the Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Skin Moisturizer and cleanser through Bzz Agent.  Overall they are both solid products.  It definitely moisturizes the skin, and when you put it on, it does not feel watery.  It feels more like it is actually covering the skin.  As far as the cleanser, that cleans the skin with making it feel stripped and dry.  For the lotion, the smell was a little strange.  It smells somewhat yeasty or paste-like.  The smell does wear off after a short amount of time, so it&#x27;s not a huge distraction or bother.  My brother, also a sensitive skin person, said that the lotion felt a little tingly.  I didn&#x27;t experience that.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for sensitive skin. I have severe allergies to many chemicals, especially certain make-up, facial lotion, and sunscreen. My face can easily feel itchy and burning. I don&#x27;t have any reactions or oily skin after use.</li>
    <li> If you use Burts Bees anything, Just letting you all know. My girlfriend used a sample of this daily moisturizing creme for sensitive skin 4-5 days ago and the next day it severely dried out her face. The skin is cracked around her nose and chin and her neck is dry and sore. I suggested to her it might have been the cream that was the problem because I watched her put it on, We tried it again on her arm and it left behind a spot that is dry and sore exactly like her face and neck. We contacted the company with a full description of what had happened today 3/6/12 and they clearly did not read the message. They told her to contact their health department, but to get back to them after she documented what happened to her with one of THEIR doctors, nurses, or vets if she still wanted a refund (for the FREE sample which shows they didn&#x27;t read the message) and thanked her for being a \\&quot;loyal customer\\&quot;. Its suppose to be for SENSITIVE skin which she has and there are no warnings on the bottle that this could happen. Be aware if you have a problem Burt&#x27;s BEES IS A BUSINESS THAT DOSE NOT CARE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this also happens to you try using Vaseline it is helping her nicely with the dryness and cracking.</li>
    <li> I received a full size bottle of the Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Skin Daily Moisturizing Cream from BzzAgent.com to try. While I don&#x27;t like the moisturizer quite as well as I like the cleanser, it is a good product. The main thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is actually the container. I find it difficult to get the right amount out. If I use a full pump worth, it is too much but it is difficult to only press the pump part way down. The moisturizer is fragrance-free but has the same scent as the cleanser. The scent fades quickly though. To me the moisturizer feels a bit sticky when it is first applied but it leaves my skin feeling soft once it has a minute to soak in. The moisturizer contains rice extract for moisturizing and aloe for soothing along with the cotton extract which is in all of the products in the sensitive skin line. I do wish that Burt&#x27;s Bees offered a version of this with the addition of sunscreen. I like having moisturizer and sunscreen in the same product so I am not adding layers of products to my face each day. I love that all of the products in the sensitive skin line are 99% natural, hypo-allergenic, dermatologist tested, and allergy tested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other Burt&#x27;s Bees products in the past and really enjoy them. Some things that I really like about the company are:&lt;br /&gt;No animal testing&lt;br /&gt;Natural ingredients whenever possible and clearly labeled&lt;br /&gt;Environmental friendly packaging and manufacturing processes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was very pleased with the products in the Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Skin Solutions for Sensitive Skin line. I have always found Burt&#x27;s Bees to offer high quality products at reasonable prices. While I received these products for free for review purposes, the opinion and experience presented in this review is entirely my own.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use moisturizers without sunscreen anymore but this is a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Perfect product in perfect shape!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s not greasy at all, it is absorbed immediately, is fragrance free and never causes irritation. My skin is normal but borders on being dry and sensitive. I received this product years ago from Bzzagent to try for free. I have been buying it every two months ever since. While this doesn&#x27;t bother me, some people have concerns that there is no SPF in the product. (I&#x27;m not a fan of moisturizers with sun screen because I feel like they&#x27;re heavy on my skin. I prefer to keep the sunscreen in my makeup)</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Skin daily moisturizing cream is a low cost product that does what it claims to do - use 99% natural ingredients without causing redness or irritation.  It is also fragrance free and hypo-allergenic.  I started using this product day and night after using [[ASIN:B004W24LQ6 Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Skin Facial Cleanser with Cotton Extract, 6 Ounce]].  First of all, I have very sensitive skin that is prone to redness and hives.  My first impression of this moisturizer is positive.  It reminds me very much of Kiehl&#x27;s Moisturizer[[ASIN:B000H75DKS 4.2 oz Ultra Facial Moisturizer  All Skin Types )]] in that it is very plain and creamy yet light.  The reason I give this product 3.5 out of 5 stars is because it does not provide adequate coverage for my under-eye wrinkles.  For instance, I can use La Mer all over my face and I won&#x27;t need any other product.  However, if I use BB&#x27;s moisturizing cream, I need to supplement it with an under-eye cream.  Also, this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t seem to last all day long.  Soon it will be winter and where I live, the moisture is zapped out of the air.  I already know that this product will not provide enough coverage in the winter - I will have to apply it more than once a day.  I am optimistic about this product, however because I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple days and it&#x27;s holding up to the department store brands (like the Kiehl&#x27;s I mentioned earlier) but for a fraction of the price.  Also, it&#x27;s probably unfair to compare it to La Mer.  For those of you who are into packaging like I am, I was impressed that a corporation like Clorox (owner of Burt&#x27;s Bees) managed to design dispenser just right.  It pumps out the perfect amount of moisturizing cream every time and it&#x27;s compact - a good travel companion that&#x27;s not fragile.  Hope this review helps you make a decision!  FYI - I am reviewing this product after receiving a sample from BzzAgent).</li>
    <li> I am a 32 year old woman who has been very picky in findinga skin-care regimen for my entire life - for that reason, it has been hard to have any kind of consistent routine in taking care of my skin. I am especially fond of natural products, which has catered to my pickiness, given there had not been many of these products to choose from while growing up. I would have to say that finding this product absolutely came at the right time as my age is getting to a point where I probably shouldn&#x27;t disregard a skin-care routine any longer. After having tried the cleanser and moisturizer every morning for the past week, I think i have found a product I can stick with for the long-term. It caters to my needs, without too many harsh ingredients affecting seemingly virgin skin. If you are reading this and find what I have said resounding with you, then this product is for you! I received this product as a BZZZ Agent - I will most certainly continue purchusing this product once my free product has finished.</li>
    <li> I have been using burts bee&#x27;s products for years, this is my least favorite product thus far. The &#x27;cream&#x27; as they call it- is more like a lotion. Its very thin and really does not quench my dry skin. It is very gentle though and would be very suitable for sensitive skin. But really, overall, its so thin that I would probably recommend it to somebody who has oily skin. If you have dry skin, don&#x27;t buy this, seriously. Right now, when I use this, it sinks in and my skin feels like, whoa, wait , hey! So I have to use another cream on top of it! If you have oily skin and do not require to much in the way of moisturisation- this will be suitable for you.</li>
    <li> I would totally recommend this to a friend. I use it nearly everyday, and my skin has never been irritated by it. I love that a little of it goes a long way, that I can put it on before my makeup and my face isn&#x27;t left all oily, and the sweet, spicy smell of it. You only need a tiny little dab to cover the dry areas, so the price is well worth it. This little bottle will last me a long time!</li>
    <li> I am a BzzAgent also and received this as a sample.  I have been using it (along with the cleanser) for a few weeks now and it is pretty good.  I like how lightweight it is on my skin, the lack of scent, and the reduction in redness in my skin.  The only reason I hesitate to give it five stars is because although it hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts, it is not helping clear my acne and rosacea flare up.  I will probably buy this as long as it doesn&#x27;t make me breakout.</li>
    <li> I review products for BzzAgent and received a free tube of Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Skin Solutions facial cleanser and daily sensitive moisturizing cream. Burt&#x27;s Bees has a extensive line of products, and all use natural and gentle ingredients. I felt that the   facial cleanser came out of the tube to quickly and that I was wasting some every time I used it. Also after I washed it off,  my skin felt a little sticky. The same thing happened when I used the daily moisturizing cream although I liked the packaging of that better. It has pump action control on the top of the bottlethat gives you the perfect amount to use each time. I suffer from psoriasis andhad no problem using either product. I didn&#x27;t care for the smell or lack of scentto the product but after using the product and the initial sticky feeling went away I found that it left my face feeling smooth and clean. I like the fact that their products are hypoallergenic, dermatologist tested and allergy tested. In the future I can see myself purchasing the moisturizing lotion but probably not the cleanser. In fact I noticed if you go to Burt&#x27;s Bees web page right now you can get a two dollar off coupon. You can also see an extensive line of Burt&#x27;s Bees products in your local pharmacy or department store cosmetic aisle or just check out burtsbees.com for more info.</li>
    <li> I use this along with Yes to Cucumbers gentle milk cleanser (&amp;#60;3) and a homemade diluted apple cider vinegar toner, and it works well. I get a pimple here and there only when I do not wash my face daily, otherwise this system works well. Its hard to say which piece is the effective &amp;#34;acne eliminator&amp;#34; but I like this moisturizer and think it does a good job for its purpose. It goes on a little heavy and feels a little thick at first, but that feeling fades in about 15 minutes. Leaves skin moisturized while also using natural ingredients, so to me its a fair trade off! Neutral scent.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product...just not enough of it.  It made my skin feel so soft.  I would definitely buy again</li>
    <li> This product, I had high hopes for. I prefer to use natural products as I have very sensitive skin and LOVE other Burt&#x27;s products, however this product did not seem to moisturize very well and ended up suffocating my skin to the point of oiliness. It felt as if it just sat on my skin. I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Excellent natural face lotion. Haven&#x27;t had any issues as far as irritation goes. Smells a little funny at first but goes away quickly. Worth the $$$.</li>
    <li> I love pretty much anything Burt&#x27;s Bees has, and this is no exception. Now I don&#x27;t think I have sensitive skin per say, I figure it can&#x27;t hurt and use sensitive products on my skin and face. The scent is very relaxing and not over powering. It&#x27;s a nice cream that absorbs very fast and easily. The size may not appear big, but lasts quite a while.</li>
    <li> I love this! I have very dry skin, I get this delivered every month by subscribe n save and it saves me about $2 compared to if you went to walgreens to buy it. If you love this you will like the one with royal jelly even more! They are both great</li>
    <li> I am allergic to many things and this cream is perfect. It&#x27;s not to heavy and doesn&#x27;t have any smell. I&#x27;ve had no problem with skin breakouts</li>
    <li> Loving this product so far - it&#x27;s light, not greasy and virtually no scent. I use a lot of Burt&#x27;s Bees products and have always been happy!</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees does it again. The lotion works great for moisturizing your face with out making it oily and having you break out. The lotion is pricey for the amount you get, hence the 4 stars. If it was $3 cheaper, I would give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a BzzAgent and received this from a Buzz campaign.    This moisturizer is great!  I usually use Aveeno Daily Moisturizer, as it doesn&#x27;t cause problems with my skin, and this is very similar, if not better.  Very moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t make my skin itch, lasts a long time, and is non-oily.  The scent isn&#x27;t great, but what can you expect for a product for sensitive skin!  The only other thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it comes in a container that reminds me of a spray-on deodorant.  But overall, very good product.</li>
    <li> I have been using the sensitive face wash and lotion for a few weeks now and I LOVE it! I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts since starting it. I also have extremely dry skin and it has kept my face hydrated and so soft and smooth. I will tell everyone who has sensitive skin to try it out. I&#x27;m excited to keep using it with the cold days coming up! LOVE LOVE LOVE Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
    <li> I was thrilled when I received this in my free BzzKit to sample and review. I have been a longtime fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products, but I have to admit that I didn&#x27;t consider myself to have sensitive skin. I was more excited for my boyfriend, whose skin responds to the weather changes here in the Northeast very dramatically. We&#x27;ve both been using it though, and I have been pleasantly surprised at what a great moisturizer it is, just in general. I have oily, acne-prone skin, and I haven&#x27;t found that this has made me break out more than usual. In addition, I sometimes get a strange reaction on my neck when I wear jewelry (I think it&#x27;s a metal allergy, but haven&#x27;t pinned it down yet). When that happens, putting any lotion or anything on it makes the skin on my neck BURN - turn bright red and sting enough to bring tears to my eyes. Putting the Burt&#x27;s Bees sensitive skin moisturizing cream on it, though, doesn&#x27;t affect it nearly as much as traditional moisturizers not made for sensitive skin. It&#x27;s going to be very handy to have around for when that happens, and I have a feeling that it will become a staple product for my boyfriend. We both love that it&#x27;s almost 100% natural - we try not to use any harsh chemicals on our faces anyway, not just because of his sensitive skin.  The only reason I don&#x27;t give it five stars is because I think that these days, ANY moisturizer intended to be used during the day should have SPF. I know that Burt&#x27;s Bees isn&#x27;t exactly behind the pack in that one, since I can rarely find any brand that has SPF in addition to the other attributes I want in a moisturizer, but I would dock them all a star for that. I think there MUST be a way to make all of these products with SPF... Sensitive+SPF, Acne treating+SPF, Wrinkle Fighting+SPF etc. I don&#x27;t want to pay an arm and a leg more to protect my skin from the sun... now that science has shown how essential it is to wear sunscreen, I think that beauty product manufacturers should catch up.  Anyway, aside from my little rant... if you have sensitive skin, I would definitely give this one a go. At the very least, it won&#x27;t irritate skin that is already inflamed or otherwise reactive, and it might even help calm it down.</li>
    <li> I recieved a full sized sample to try as a BzzAgent. It&#x27;s not completely oil free, but it absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t seem oily on the skin.  It absorbs so fast I felt I needed to apply it quickly. It&#x27;s very mild and wasn&#x27;t irritating even around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Nice, all-natural product for sensitive skin. Hasn&#x27;t made me break out and keeps me moisturized. Only problem is it has no sunscreen, which I like to have in a Daily Moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizing cream I&#x27;ve found. It&#x27;s very light and is absorbed very easily and quickly into the skin without making it feel greasy. It doesn&#x27;t irritate or cause pimples. It&#x27;s perfect as an aftershave balm or for those very dry winter days. Plus, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I would say I have medium sensitive skin, and don&#x27;t easily break out. My skin reacts really well to this stuff. I typically didn&#x27;t use face cream but after receiving this as a gift I use it every day and my skin looks really great. I&#x27;ve been using it since Christmas 2014 every day, and have had no problems. Really a great product. Smell is understated and package lasts a while. Great smooth creamy texture.</li>
    <li> This cream is very light and the smell is fairly neutral. I need a deeper moisturizer for my dry skin so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again. Probably better for oily skins.</li>
    <li> My sensitive skin loves this product and the price on Amazon is the best!</li>
    <li> This cream did not irritate my skin as many things do.  It&#x27;s expensive, but works.</li>
    <li> I received this product through a bzz campaign and I&#x27;m so glad I did! It is rich and highly moisturizing, contains mostly natural ingredients, and is very gentle on my skin.  It&#x27;s especially great for when my skin is dry, but it is not too rich to use during the fall months.  Plus a little bit goes a long way, so I just dispense about a pea size for my whole face and neck.  The scent is light and reminds me of sweetened oatmeal (which I find pleasant), but it fades quickly after application.  It&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> I got Burts Bees Sensitive Skin Facial Moisturizer to try for free as a bzz agent, what I love about it is that it blends so well with my makeup. The product has a nice smell and goes on smoothly. I used the product for several days and had no issues with my sensitive skin. I love to buy this brand whenever I can because they are so environmentally friendly, but I&#x27;m disappointed that the moisturizer doesn&#x27;t have SPF in it. In this day and age I wont wear something for long if it does protect my skin from the suns rays.</li>
    <li> I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Skin Solutions for Sensitive Skin Facial Cleanser and Daily Moisturizer since I received it as BuzzAgent on October 3, 2011.  It has definitely not caused any irritation to my sensitive facial skin at all.  I would have liked to experience a noticeable difference in the softness and smoothness of my skin, but I did not with Burt&#x27;s Bees as I have with other facial skin products.  My main woe with the moisturizer is that it has no sun protection, which my face is very sensitve to, and I have to apply a sun protection product over the top of it every single day.  For the price of $9.99 (cleanser) and $14.99 (moisturizer) I will look for sensitive facial products with a little more scrub in the cleanser and sun protection in the moisturizer.  I like the fact that Burt&#x27;s Bees products are all natural, but I still need protection from our natural sunlight too.</li>
    <li> This is a gentle, smooth product that&#x27;s great for sensitive skin.  Wish it also had SPF for an easy, one-step lotion in the morning.</li>
    <li> This lotion is perfect for dry, sensitive skin. I put it on almost every night. I have very sensitive skin prone to breaking out and I have had no qualms with this product!</li>
    <li> I previously used the Vitamin E moisturizer by The Body Shop, and while I really liked it (it smelled amazing!!), and this one is a great substitute. It&#x27;s considerably cheaper and it moisturizes just as well. I also prefer the pump bottle, as it keeps the product more sanitary.</li>
    <li> I was initially impressed with this moisturizer. I am a BzzAgent &amp; received a full size product to try &amp; review. I like the packaging &amp; a little goes a long way &amp; my skin felt softer and definitely more moisturized. Sometimes I get itchy, dry skin in the fall as the weather changes and I avoided that this year. However, my skin did break out instead. My skin is acne prone &amp; it is hard to find a moisturizer that moisturizes without clogging my pores. I wish this line of products included an acne ingredient as well.</li>
    <li> I was excited to have the opportunity to try this product as a Bzz Agent. I love Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products and there is a lot to like about this lotion. It blends well, absorbs quickly is safe for sensitive skin and is made from natural ingredients like cotton extract. A little goes a long way so this bottle will last forever. The scent isn&#x27;t overly pleasant but doesn&#x27;t linger and is understandable that they don&#x27;t want to use added fragrences in a product designed for senstive skin. The big miss, for me, is the lack of sunscreen in the product. My sensitive skin is also very senstive to the sun so I would prefer my daily moisturizer to contain SPF.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes but what a dissapointment! I have combination/oily and it&#x27;s hard to find a product that works. This moisturiser was heavy and pasty and had a breakout. Never buying it again!  I tried neutrogena naturals and couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
    <li> I am very thankful for this product. Light enough for my skin.. But still deeply moisturizing. So helpful that I put on a recent sunspot on my neck.  A week later after applying I literally scratched the sun spot off to reveal new skin underneath. I&#x27;m not sure if it was this cream or fate, but it helped me tremendously.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is AMAZING. Smooth, lightweight, and great for my sensitive skin. I&#x27;m really picky, and my skin reacts to some moisturizers with tiny clogged pores and bumps, which I hate, obviously. This moisturizer is the best one I&#x27;ve found out of drugstore and luxury brands. The complaints I have with the product are packaging and volume related. 1.7 oz is not a lot of moisturizer, especially lightweight formulas. The bottle is misleading. It looks like it should hold at least 3 oz of moisturizer instead of the 1.7! And while the pump packaging is handy, I find it gives me about twice as much as I need. So while my neck, decolletage and hands appreciate the extra moisture, I&#x27;d rather use less and have it last longer. I&#x27;m finding myself going through one bottle per month, since I use it at night as well. I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement just to save some pennies, but I think I&#x27;m just going to have to suck it up, because nothing works on my skin like this stuff. I also use the makeup removal wipes in this line, which are also great.</li>
    <li> Great price, smells good, wish there was a way I know when I&#x27;m running out so that I can reorder</li>
    <li> I truly wanted this to work, but I broke out with this also. But, I&#x27;m finishing the bottle using it on my arms and hands. I&#x27;m truly bummed!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive 50  year old skin with the \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone oiliness. Yay me. This lotion is very moisturizing on my cheeks, feels very soft. I use it sparingly on my T zone and dont have any issues as far as it being more oily. Little goes a long way. Awesome !</li>
    <li> This is a nice quality moisturizing cream. It works very well for my face, especially around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I was trying to find a more natural and less pricey alternative to my Cetaphil face wash and my Mark Calm and Composed lotion.  I have classic combo skin: extremely oily t-zone, but dry patches around the cheeks/mouth areas. I bought this lotion along with the Burt&#x27;s Bees sensitive skin cleanser after reading all the reviews about people experiencing these wonderful transformations. I appreciate that this lotion was lightweight and not oily, but it seems to aggravate my drier areas and leave patches of dry skin, tight skin, and a slight burning sensation.  Unlike most other reviewers, I DO like that this does not contain a sunscreen because sunscreens tend to make me break out so I only use them when I know I&#x27;m going to have a lot of sun exposure.  I&#x27;m going to exchange this for the night time sensitive cream version before completely giving up on their products with the hopes that I just need something more moisturizing, as I do like the cleanser more than Cetaphil.  I&#x27;m a little fearful though that my skin is having a reaction to the phenoxyethanol that is being used as the preservative.  We&#x27;ll see!  I may just have to bit the bullet and go back to my Mark Calm and Composed lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: After receiving and using the Night Cream version of this product, I am so happy to report that I love Burt&#x27;s Bees now!  I highly recommend getting the Night Cream instead if you have drier skin or combo skin. It&#x27;s not heavy like most night creams so it can be used during the day without any lingering greasy feeling or look.  Along with the cleanser, my skin looks better than it has in years!</li>
    <li> I received my BuzzAgent kit this weekend and tried this product out. I am very iffy about my skin care products and I must say this is a great product! My skin feels softer... who knew that cotton could be used in skin care (other than to apply product to that is). I would recommend this not only to sensitive skin people but anyone that wants to try something new with out the scare of a strange reaction. Good Job Burt&#x27;s! I dont usually classify my skin as sensitive skin but in the Winter its a great moisterizer!!</li>
    <li> Have suffered not only with a sensitive skin but with acne all my teen years and adult life as well, am very wary of any product that touches my face. So as a BzzAgent when I got the moisturizer I did not think twice, as Burt&#x27;s Bees is synonymous with natural and not so harsh ingredients. The cream is not greasy and does not feel sticky after application, easily absorbed and makes skin soft.</li>
    <li> I am also a Bzz Agent, and received this product as a free sample to try. I have always been a fan of the Burt&#x27;s Bees line of products, but I had yet to try one of their moisturizers. My skin tends to be oily, so I usually avoid these like the plague, because I had yet to find one that didn&#x27;t clog my pores (even the ones that claimed not to). Well, I tried it for the first time just yesterday, following the recommended regime of applying it after using the face wash...and I have to say: this product is completely different from all of the other moisturizers that I have tried in the past! I awoke this morning with smooth, supple skin, with no breakouts, bumps, or irritation! Finally! I really think that the addition of cotton was a super smart move, and I definitely see a trend coming! I highly recommend this product if you are someone who is prone to breakouts, and looking for a moisturizer that will do the job without leaving a layer of gunk and chemicals on your face!</li>
    <li> (Another BzzAgent, I was sent a sample of this lotion to try.)   I was very excited to try out this new sensitive skin care line from Burt&#x27;s Bees. I have used Burt&#x27;s products in the past and really liked the quality, plus I have pretty sensitive skin, so this seemed right up my alley.  This lotion is very rich and creamy. I did not experience any sensitivity issues or irritation at all while using it. Plus, it only takes a little to cover my whole face and neck. The only con for me is that I think the lotion gives a little to much moisture for my oily/combination skin.</li>
    <li> I am a Bzz Agent so I was able to sample this product for free.  I enjoyed the natural ingredients of the moisturizer, and how lightwight it is once I applied it on my face.  I also like the dispenser it comes in.  It really makes it easy to dispense a small amount.  I just wish it included in SPF too!</li>
    <li> En...I hope my honey will love it, her skin is exceeding sensitive</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products, so I might be a bit biased. I think this is a great product for people with sensitive skin who just want a moisturizer without any other &amp;#34;gimmicks&amp;#34; (such as anti-aging, or acne clearing, or any other miracle promises). I have historically had combination skin, so it&#x27;s harder to find a product that moisturizes those dry patches enough, but this does just fine. I do alternate daily use with another moisturizer; I use this in the morning, and something with one of the extra &amp;#34;gimmicks&amp;#34; at night. Works really well after using the cleansing wipes.</li>
    <li> It is hard for me to find good moisturizers. I have psoriasis and my skin usually hates everything. I will be purchasing more of this.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer! It makes my skin feel super soft and hydrated. One thing I wish it had was spf, but that&#x27;s hard to find in a low chemical cream.</li>
    <li> I have oily, sensitive skin and this is the first moisturizer I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily and greasy and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I hope they never stop making this product.  It is perfect for my skin.  I love how it soaks right into my skin and makes my skin look and feel so soft.  If you have oily skin, give it a try.  My skin adores this moisturizer!</li>
    <li> My skin is oily and acne-prone, but is also sensitive to products and becomes dry, tight, and flaky in the cooler months.  I&#x27;ve tried so many lotions, hoping to find one that gives me light moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or make my skin red, and finally found one.  Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Daily Moisturizing Cream really delivers the results I&#x27;ve sought out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Very light-weight.  Absorbs fast and fully in moments, and never feels heavy on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;- Mild scent, kind of like cinnamon in a way.  Not at all overpowering, which is lovely.&lt;br /&gt;- Mostly natural ingredients and does not contain parabens (very important to me).&lt;br /&gt;- Has not once caused irritation or redness on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;- Pump bottle is nice and works well.  Takes up little counter space.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t cause excess oil production (some lotions do on me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- No SPF&lt;br /&gt;- Pricey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this facial cream daily for almost a month and love it.  I don&#x27;t need much to get the proper moisturizing.  My face isn&#x27;t flaky or dry, but not irritated either.  It is well-balanced and delivers great results.  I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone, male or female.</li>
    <li> Good for sensitive skin, fair price for quality of product. I wish they made it in a larger size. Great gentle mousturizer</li>
    <li> I like this cream, purchased after reading the reviews. been using it for a couple days now, besides a bit rich when first applying, everything seems nice about this cream, my face is smooth and silky throughout the day. it is made out of natural ingredients so it does smell a little bit like delicious baked buns...which makes me hungry every time i put this cream on.</li>
    <li> My husband and I use this product and love it. We both have sensitive skin, but this stuff doesn&#x27;t irritate. It soaks in quickly, but still leaves your skin feeling hydrated. It has a pleasant smell that doesn&#x27;t linger. We have it on subscription; it&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> This goes on a little heavy and pasty, but like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have any nasty harmful chemicals!</li>
    <li> Much too oily for my face. Tried to save some money, but I returned to Clinique and similarly priced moisturizers.</li>
    <li> When I apply it to my face I feel like the moisturizer makes it feel too creamy and heavy. It does do the job but I sometimes feel uncomfortable. It is okay for the price but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it..</li>
    <li> This product is so great for daily use. I recommend it even for really sensitive. And the lotion as well.</li>
    <li> Simple. Does the trick as claimed.</li>
    <li> My husband has sensitive skin all over his body.  His uses this cream as a body lotion.  He has tried several lotions.  He has seen western doctors and natural path doctors and no one could cure the rashes on his chest and back.&lt;br /&gt;After a shower when he is still damp, he applies a small amount of this face moisturizer to his body.  His skiN is soft and he no longer has breakouts!</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and I have worked hard to remove all parabens/phlalates and preservatives from my cosmetics collection. This moisturizer not only fits the bill for \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and non-toxic ingredients but it also has a very mild and pleasant smell. I have to admit that smell and fragrance is a huge turn off for me with many of Burt&#x27;s Bees competitors. For the price, this stuff is the best you can get! It also has a very nice texture. The only complaints I have is that the pump makes it slightly difficult to meter out the exact amount of product that I need any given day. Usually I end up wasting a little lotion. Also, while it is long lasting, you really need the sensitive night cream for overnight use. I tried to use the night cream 24/7 but ended up seeing white residue on my face during the day from the cream. The daily lotion is what&#x27;s perfect for daily use.</li>
    <li> Made my skin react with a red rash.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees daily moisturizer is good.  It&#x27;s a tad tacky, so I like it better at night.  It really does soften the skin and makes it feel so smooth.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin.  I&#x27;m allergic to some lotions, some products dry my skin, and others make it too oily.  This lotion is just right and makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
    <li> I use this daily moisturizing cream to remove my eye makeup each day.  I like how light it is, and non-irritating.</li>
    <li> Works great on my face, which has very sensitive skin. I tried three different moisturizers side-by-side, and this is the only one that did not irritate my face. You only need a small pea size amount of this product to cover your face. I usually reapply a second treatment later in the day to stay moisturized. The smell is not too alluring, since this moisturizer does not have added fragrance; however, that may be the key to its effectiveness.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. No breakouts. Absorbs quickly. Burt is proud of his lotions. The price per ounce will confirm that. However, I am yet to find one that does the job as well.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin &amp; this product made my cheeks burn after I applied it. The other parts of my face felt dry, this is disappointing as I use other products from Burts Bee &amp; love them.</li>
    <li> I started using this along with the Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Facial Cleanser and I love them both! When first switching, this moisturizing cream was a little hard to get used to because it can feel heavy when first applied but that is just something to get used to (because it is a cream, which was different from what I had been using). Since using this product my skin has felt so smooth and soft. I highly recommend this product! I love it!</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. I used a neutrogena moisturizer and my face started peeling and for a week felt like it was rubbed raw. I used the lotion to help fix the awful feeling and after the dryness cleared up I kept using this and my face is soft! Definitely buy. This should be rated 6/5 stars.</li>
    <li> I used Moisturel for years, but my face began break out when using it.  I changed to Burt&#x27;s Bees six months ago, and my face has done great since.  On the downside, Burt&#x27;s Bees is a bit pricey, hence four stars instead of five,  Of course, Moisturel wasn&#x27;t cheap either.</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily skin and as I&#x27;m sure thats not really the products fault it just makes my skin even oilier i tried putting smaller amounts and it just kept being oily. I would say if you love the burts bees brand like I do get the daily moisturizing cream. The price stinks but its worth it. This wasn&#x27;t all cons it smells great and goes on well I have been using it on my hands and it has really been helping me fight this cold winter dryness there but i probably won&#x27;t be putting it on my face again.</li>
    <li> This is a light, smooth moisturizer that goes on easily and sinks right into you skin. I am a fan of these products!!! Great speedy service too!!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin that breaks out easily, so this was such a welcome surprise!  It goes on smoothly and sinks in quickly without being oily.  I have a gluten allergy and was worried because the ingredients weren&#x27;t in the product description, so I listed them below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;aqua (water, eau), helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, glycerin, cetyl alcohol, CI 77947 (zinc oxide), zea mays (corn) starch, gossypium herbaceum (cotton) flower extract, oryza sativa (rice) extract, beta vulgaris (beet, extrait de racine de betterave) root extract, artemisia umbelliformis extract, euphrasia officinalis extract, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, saccharum officinarum (sugar cane, extrait de canne a sucre) extract, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, jojoba esters, hydrolyzed jojoba esters, kaolin, lecithin, sucrose, fructose, glucose, inositol, citric acid, benzoic acid, trehalose, xanthan gum, glyceryl laurate, potassium sorbate, sucrose stearate, sucrose polystearate, sodium benzoate, sodium stearoyl lactylate, sodium PCA, alcohol denat., phenoxyethanol\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE  11/1/2013&lt;br /&gt;I noticed some \\&quot;adjustment\\&quot; in my skin for a short period of time where I had a few isolated breakouts.  I added Burt Bee&#x27;s Acne Toner and that solved the problem.  I also have noticed that my red cheeks have evened out and are less red!  For me, this means that I can go without makeup when I&#x27;m not working, which is a huge difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have plenty of moisture using this product and I will definitely keep it in my daily regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still love it!</li>
    <li> In my quest for a moisturizer that works well, is unscented, and safe for my body I tried this product.  So far, this is the best I&#x27;ve had.  It rates a 3 (if I recall) on the EWG Database website, which is OK.  I&#x27;ll be looking for something with a slightly better rating, as well as slightly less expensive, but for right now this is pretty decent.</li>
    <li> When I started using this product, I kept getting red, itchy, painful, swollen eyes. I thought it was my contacts, then I couldn&#x27;t even get my contacts in without irritation. I stopped using this moisturizer and was shocked when the irritation went away. I never had anything like this happen to me before using any skin or makeup products. It was pretty scary. Skin Deep says the ingredient Phenoxyethanol can irritate skin, eyes, or lungs - maybe that was the issue. [...]</li>
    <li> In the winter I get dry skin on my face, so I got this and now my wife is using it all up. It works really well, doesn&#x27;t have much of an odor.</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion that has worked for my EXTREMELY sensitive skin! I have bad eczema, dry skin, chapped lips, and lots of pimples... This lotion has helped with ALL of those problems. I only wish it wasn&#x27;t such a tiny bottle, but it seems to be lasting through a lot of uses. It doesn&#x27;t take an absurd amount to moisturizer my skin (which is surprising because my skin usually soaks everything right up). It hasn&#x27;t cleared up my acne by any means, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t irritate it or make it worse. I think I will try the Burt&#x27;s Bees acne line and see if when combined with the sensitive line will help save my face from all the product abuse it&#x27;s had over the years...</li>
    <li> All natural ingredients, no poisonous toxins, and smooth moisturized, soft feeling skin. This is my new face lotion for life.</li>
    <li> Long term user Excellent product</li>
    <li> I must be super ultra sensitive because this stings my face. Once the stinging subsides it doesn&#x27;t leave any visible irritation. It feels nice and smooth on my skin and absorbs great. I really wouldn&#x27;t call it a cream, though - it is much thinner than I expected. One full pump is way too much for one use so I have to very carefully just do a half pump. It is also fragrance free but that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t have any scent - it&#x27;s odd and slightly unpleasant. I probably won&#x27;t continue using it.</li>
    <li> I love this cream, especially knowing it&#x27;s a healthy product. Works all day keeping my face feeling wonderful! The scent is also subtle.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty simple cream. Simple things are sensitive skin&#x27;s best friend; bells and whistles like fruit acids and fragrance can irritate my skin, dry it out, or leave me itchy and blotchy. None of those things happen when I use this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump dispenser itself is hygienic and practical, it&#x27;s easy to dispense the right amount every time. The cream is light, non-greasy, absorbs quickly and works well under makeup. I recently tried the Burt&#x27;s Bees Intense Hydration day lotion and didn&#x27;t find that it moisturized any better than the Sensitive version does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the day cream along with the Sensitive face cleanser and night cream for a while now and together these products seem to keep breakouts at a minimum. It works fine during the winter but it doesn&#x27;t heal eczema. The only downside I can think of is there&#x27;s no SPF: I think a non-chemical sunscreen would make this even better since it is a day cream.</li>
    <li> I had been using clinique in a circular container which I did like but hated getting moisturizer all inside my fingernails.  This is much less expensive, much cleaner to use, and is gentle on my skin.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife because she&#x27;s in love with pretty much anything from Burt&#x27;s Bees... She says it&#x27;s a wonderful cream, so that gets a 5 star right there.</li>
    <li> i like burts bees products; i have mature, slightly oily skin but felt i needed a moisturizer anyway.  This is nice that it goes on under makeup nicely and doesnt break me out.</li>
    <li> I like the lightness of the product.  The smell is neutral as well.  The only issue is that I bought it to travel and it took up a lot of room in the bag to show security -- the container was much larger than I anticipated :).</li>
    <li> Great for my sensitive skin. Very light and pleasant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the company, but this product was mostly mediocre. The smell was a little off putting, though it did work just fine. For the price, you can find comparable products that are double the size. I did like it, but will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice mild moisturizer. Doesn&#x27;t do a lot of extremely dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive Irish skin, finally found a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make me blotchy. Love Burt&#x27;s Bees, my new favorite!</li>
    <li> I could only use one certain moisturizing cream before due to my sensitive skin. This one is the first I tried and it doesn&#x60;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I will use this product tomorrow morning I am looking forward to using it as the scent is very nice. I am adding to this review as I have used it a few days now, I love the way it makes my skin feel, very, very soft and well hydrated. thank you. I also like the price.</li>
    <li> excellent price, arrived early, fantastic product!</li>
    <li> I was a little bit disappointed.  Not as much moisture as I had expected.  I&#x27;ve moved on to something else. I guess this would be okay if you have normal skin type, but not good for extremely dry skin like mine.  It didn&#x27;t, however, cause any irritation on my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I just love this Burt&#x27;s Bee Sensitive Daily Moisturizing Cream.  You only need to use a little and you feel the moisture in your face all day.  Love it!  I have extremely dry, sensitive skin and and I use all of Burt&#x27;s Bee Sensitive products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to petroleum products and this stuff works great, although I&#x27;ve found that Garnier Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel Cream works just as well with no heavy feel.     The price is a little high but it&#x27;s worth it to me because my skin is soooo sensitive and it&#x27;s nice to have options.</li>
    <li> Very nice moisturizer...works well and causes no sensitivity issues.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous cream that can be used day and night. The packaging is sanitary and allows the ingredients, some of which are quite beneficial to skin, to remain stable. I have purchased this over and over because it is soothing and can be used at any time; it works well under make up because it sinks in nicely. I love that it is fragrance free. That&#x27;s so hard to find sometimes. It also has no irritating ingredients, at least that I am aware of and I have very sensitive skin. At night I pair it with a serum to increase moisturization and to give it a &#x27;boost &#x27;. NOTE: The ingredients listed here with Amazon are not accurate. Check the box for the accurate ingredients.</li>
    <li> After a facial cleaning this tops it all. It makes your face feel nice A SMOOTH..</li>
    <li> Skin still felt dry even after applying generously.</li>
    <li> I really like this when used by itself; however, I live in South FL so I must wear daily sunscreen and this doesn&#x27;t (like other Burt&#x27;s Bees daily moisturizers I have tried) seem to soak in after the sunscreen. Maybe because the sunscreen is waterproof?  The sensitive skin night cream is great too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m also a Bzz Agent and just began using this product.  I do like how it goes on.  It&#x27;s very smoothe.  I am hoping it will help to calm the slight redness on my cheeks.  Not crazy about the smell though.  I hope it works!!</li>
    <li> I got this day lotion to try in a BZZZ kit. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and I love it. It&#x27;s for sensitive skin so it doesn&#x27;t bother me, there is no fragrance, and best of all it leaves my skin feeling smooth and not greasy. Another great Burt&#x27;s Bees product!</li>
    <li> I received this product from being a Bzzagent and I think this facial moisturizer is a great product. As the weather is getting colder this is the time of year when moisturizer is a necessity and this is a great one as it goes on thin and does not have that \\&quot;Old lady\\&quot; lotion smell. It works great on my half oily/half dry skin to help balance it all out.</li>
    <li> I received a full size sample of this cream and I was really excited to try it, but I was a bit disappointed in it. It makes my skin red as I apply and I feel like I have to rub it in for a few minutes till it has completely soaked in my skin, otherwise it leaves white spots and streaks of lotion. You only need a small dab of lotion to apply to the whole face, which is good because it will last you a long time! I wish it had SPF, though!</li>
    <li> I got to try this product for free through Buzz Agent.  It has worked great for me.  My skin is usually prone to breaking out in pimples and red spots due to stress and allergies.  Since I have been using the Burt&#x27;s Bees Moisturizer for sensitive skin my pimples and red spots occur much less frequently, and after using it for a month straight my skin is clear now.  A little bit of the product goes a long way, so this container should last a fairly long time.  I have several family members with sensitive skin and/or eczema and I have recommended it to them as well.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this lotion from BzzAgent. Overall it is a nice light lotion for warmer months. When the weather got cold this was not heavy enough for my skin. It was gentle on sensitive skin though. I&#x27;d probably buy this product next spring and continue with my heavier winter lotion.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to give a helping hand to people like me who tried everything on this planet with minor results and want some relief from their suffering. This cream is almost magical believe me I tried almost every cream out there without any true change to my skin issues. I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes on day two my skin was so much better I&#x27;m truly a believer this cream is outstanding !!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is just so-so. Definitely not a miracle product. There are better moisturizers out there.</li>
    <li> I used this every day and never dries out my skin.  Perfect for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Amazing for my sensitive skin. I had a problem after I used my BHA exfoliating lotion from paula&#x27;s choice and this product helped me to calm my skin. Very good</li>
    <li> It feel good but not nourish enough for my mature and dry skin. I&#x27;ll keep using it but combining with a bit of natural facial oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands (including expensive ones like Lancôme, Estee Lauder, etc) but never tried anything that awful - the smell, the feeling (feels like you put a sunscreen on, the one that has zinc, you know). Was really suspicious that a face cream can be that cheap but decided to give it a try based on all these great reviews! I am still somewhat in shock not getting why so many people find it to be a great cream! used it a hand/foot cream but still did not like it. Never buying this brand again! (love all their baby&#x27;s products, like shampoo, etc.)</li>
    <li> Very nice moisturizer, no bad odor and feels very good on.</li>
    <li> Great product for anyone with sensitive skin! Doesn&#x27;t clog pores or leave an oily feeling after application.</li>
    <li> I have mixed skin, I get acne sometimes on my chin and forehead, but my skin is also very sensitive. This has been the perfect moisturizer, it&#x27;s not greasy, and my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out. I&#x27;ve never had any problems with it causing irritation. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 6 months now and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Love it! I have sensitive skin and needed a facial moisturizer badly and now I am saved! I recommend for anyone with sensitive skin! It came in fast and is everything I imagined!</li>
    <li> works well and doesn&#x27;t irritate skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 51, male, and have had very dry, reactive, and sensitive skin most of my adult life.  I&#x27;ve tried everything, including fish oils, frequent hydration, and humidifiers in the house, not to mention many many moisturizing creams and lotions over the years.  Lately, i&#x27;ve tried to only buy more natural, paraben and chemical-free moisturizers that won&#x27;t irritate my skin and/or allow these toxins and poisons to seep into my body.  My wife recommended this one to me, and it works GREAT!  My skin feels supple and smooth, and my dry patches have dissappeared!  I rub some on my face, elbow, and knee joints after a morning shower, and it works all day. This stuff has quickly become one of my two favorite daily moisturizing creams, the other one being Dr. Mercola&#x27;s organic cupuacu daily moisturizer cream.  Kudos to &#x27;Burts Bees&#x27; for offering this truly great product!  I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
    <li> All of Burt&#x27;s Bees products are great and this is no disappointment.  Very gentle and kind on older skin and keeps me from being dry and itchy.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Great for the face - light/non-sticky and low fragrance. I also like the pump design to dispense the lotion.</li>
    <li> Not happy with this product at all. I have sensitive skin and a few minutes after applying, my skin gets chapped with white skin flakes and it leaves my skin even more dry!! I gave this product a try for a week and had the same dry results each day. Not good at all for those with true sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Smells just like rice water very pleasant scent. It is not very thick, so it will absorb fast, but my face had a reaction to it and broke out really bad.</li>
    <li> If you are prone to breakouts DO NOT use this! yuck..and it feels sticky on your skin! What a F waste of money....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for those who are not prone to breakouts and have normal skin (lucky), it could work for you</li>
    <li> works as good as oil of olay.&lt;br /&gt;It really is great for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing and I&#x27;m not one to write reviews much.  This moisturizer goes on light but moisturizes like a heavier cream.  You can use liberal amount and it doesn&#x27;t clog pores. It leaves no shine either or greasy residue.  Only bad or negative thing I can think of is the price. Little pricey in my opinion. All and all I would say this will be your go to facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I am a BzzAgent and received this product through a buzz campaign.  I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm for many years but have not tried many of their other products in the past.  The aspects of their lip balm that I have loved for years definitely carry over into their other products!  I do not have extremely sensitive skin, but have had mild reactions to some cleansers that I have used in the past.  This moisturizer is very light and gentle.  It is made almost entirely of natural products and it not tested on animals.  The lotion absorbs into my skin very quickly and does not leave it feeling greasy.  A small amount of this lotion is enough to cover my entire face.  It does not have any scent and disappears quickly and entirely into your skin.  The only way this product could be improved for me would be to include sunscreen, although I realize this would likely make it more difficult for those with really sensitive skin to use.  Overall I think this is a really good moisturizer, especially for those with sensitive skin or who prefer a product with natural ingredients.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned, you can&#x27;t go wrong with Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
    <li> I received this mosturizer as part of a bzz campaign and I have to say, I&#x27;m hooked! The mosturizer has a very light and non-greasy feel to it and it leaves my skin soft and hydrated. I have also noticed a huge decrease in redness and breakouts. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product in the mail as a BzzAgent.  The first day I tried the moisturizer I discovered that a little bit goes a long way.  A full squeeze would have been enough to cover my face, neck, and shoulders.  The product goes on smooth but I have been having to remove excess with a towel, perhaps I&#x27;m still applying to much.  As far as the sensitive skin claims, after a few weeks of use it has not improved any underlying symptoms (redness) but it has caused no new problems which is a plus.  I especially like the fact that it is virtually odorless.  I would recommend using it in combination with the face wash to achieve best results.</li>
    <li> I suffer from itchy, dry places on my face and also have an oily T zone.  This particular moisture has helped with both problems.  The itchiness has subsided in the last 2 weeks since beginning to use the moisturizing, and my forehead and nose are less oily.  My skin feels softer and more like I expect it to feel with a good quality moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I really like Burt&#x27;s bees products, I uses lot of them. Unfortunate this moisturizer made my skin break out, bad.  Won&#x27;t be using again.</li>
    <li> Light and natural on my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> My skin is oily and very sensitive. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of face lotions -- many makes me face either break out or just red and blotchy. Two lotions that sort of works: Kiehls - doesn&#x27;t irritate but makes my pores bigger. LaMer - doesn&#x27;t irritate either but somehow it only works as a night lotion - the next morning feeling is amazing but during the day use - it tends to be a bit too thick and oily for being active during the day (I&#x27;m not talking about exercise or anything -- just normal daytime activities) Burt&#x27;s Bee is perf for me as a daily face lotions. Absolutely no irritation and goes on very smoothly.</li>
    <li> I switched over to this once I found out that the people over at Loving Naturals have gone on family hiatus.  Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling on the skin.  So far so good!</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly and absorbs nicely. Good for oily and sensitive skin. It is very reasonably priced for a facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for my sensitive skin, causing break outs and itching. I use other burt&#x27;s products, but my face is especially sensitive and this isn&#x27;t a keeper.</li>
    <li> I had an allergic reaction to this moisturizer. Even after I washed it off, my face was so red and I even had one spot that the skin had broken open. I had only worn for 2 hours!</li>
    <li> Tried for something different. Good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> it did a good gob. my  skin started to look really good and bright</li>
    <li> Very nice moisturizing cream. Non greasy and no annoying fragrances.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter who has dry skin and she loves it!!&lt;br /&gt;No added chemicals is the reason I love Burt&#x27;s Bees</li>
    <li> I have to rosasea and no medicine or expensive creams helped me however Buurt&#x27;s Beees Sencitive Daily Moisturizing. cream if I have a clean face red disappeared cream really is excellent I recommend</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizer I use for my acne-prone, sensitive skin. It does not break me out, and it gives my skin a very fresh, vibrant appearance. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is a good company which tries to use natural ingredients without sacrificing quality of product.  This moisturizing cream soaks in well and is not greasy.</li>
    <li> Great Product, I have oily to dry skin and cannot use many products so this has worked very well for me.</li>
    <li> The daily moisturizing cream that I usually use is very pricey, so much so that I decided that using it twice a day morning and night was probably racking me up at least another couple pairs of shoes a year in money I could be saving. So, I decided to try Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Skin Daily Moisturizer as an alternative or substitute for my nighttime regimen. The moisturizer is just ok, I appreciate that it is 99% natural and for the price, it is a decent product, but it left my skin not feeling as soft and moisturized as other products. If you&#x27;re looking for a cream for sensitive skin and not wanting to pay top dollar, this is probably a good start and a good product to purchase and test out. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different so this may be perfect for your skin type!</li>
    <li> I love most of Burt&#x27;s products. However this one lacks one very important item. There is no \\&quot;SPF\\&quot; for day time sun protection!</li>
    <li> I  was sent a sample of this lotion after doing some research online. I really do love this lotion and agree that its defiantly a product for warmer weather. It sinks right into the skin and keeps my skin hydrated all day. I also have not experienced any oily build up or shine in my t-zone in my opinion it provides a matte finish in my oily areas while keeping my skin supple and smooth.</li>
    <li> For the first few days I used this (in conjunction with Boots No 7 Calm Skin Redness-relief gel and Boots No. 7 Soft &amp; Soothed Gentle Toner), I thought it wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough. After a few days, and a very moisturizing face wash that I use after DHC cleansing oil, I noticed that I didn&#x27;t need additional moisture. More importantly, my skin is softer and definitely less reactive than it was before. It also retains moisture much better than it did before - I&#x27;m not running to the bathroom in the morning to slather my face like I was just a few weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you need to give your skin time to adjust. If this isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough, think about the other products you use. They all interact and you need to consider how they work together. I use products from lots of different companies for a reason - they are a combination that works for me. Finally, no more redness!</li>
    <li> The product is in perfect conditions. Thanks to the provider, all is ok. I recommend and i save to my favorites.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer! It is not to thick, and it does not break it my sensitive skin. I feel like all types of skin can wear this moisturizer and love it!</li>
    <li> The best for sensitive skin!  Not greasy and absorbed into skin quickly.</li>
    <li> This is great if you don&#x27;t touch your face after applying a pumpful. If I touch my face while the cream is drying my face feels dry. But if I leave it alone, I feel hydrated for the day.</li>
    <li> I have used many different creams in my days as I have very dry skin because of my condition, until I tried this Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s cream. I have to say it is the best one --I have been using it since January and love it--I use it as my day cream--under make-up also---not too greasy at all---perfect!</li>
    <li> I love the light feel of this product and the smell is good too. Moisturizes effectively for harsh New England weather without feeling greasy. I do wish it contained SPF though.</li>
    <li> Not a heavy moisturizer, covers well and doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out. Doesn&#x27;t add the extra oily feeling some products do.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I like that it is fragrance free. I use it as an aftershave, and it moisturizes without irritating. I&#x27;m also prone to breakouts, but my skin has cleared up nicely since switching to this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne for about 3 years, and have recently turned to a more gentle regimin with my skin (UltraGlow Black Soap because I dont have access to a more natural variation, but the black soap I have been using has started clearing my skin wonderfully &amp; I use witch hazel as a toner) and wanted to finish it off with another natural product , and this is PERFECT. It&#x27;s light, but still moisturizes, and even gives my face a freshness or a glow if you will. It really does have a nice smell, and dispenses a good amount of moisturizer. I had never tried any Burt&#x27;s Bees products before, but this experience has made me want to try more of their products.</li>
    <li> This is a great light weight daily moisturizer that is 99% all natural.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has the best price with their subscribe and save option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not non-comdogenic though. I&#x27;m in search of a non-comdogenic light weight moisturizer to help eliminate small black blackheads.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and usually when I change moisturizers, I end up breaking out during the adjustment period. This has not happened. It moisturizes really well. I just wish there was some sunscreen in it so I wouldn&#x27;t have to add another product.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive + dry skin and always prefer natural products and this BB&#x27;s cream is the winner! it makes my skin so soft and i love the texture of the cream- almost like a whipped cream. very happy about this product and would buy again and again!</li>
    <li> I purchased this onoline because I wanted to try a new moisturizer. I didn&#x27;t think my moisterizer was really working, so I switched to Burts Bees Sensitive Skin moisturizer. It is wonderful. Weeks after using it in the morning, i noticed my skin felt very soft and had a natural glow. There are certain days i don&#x27;t need to wear makeup. The smell is wonderful too! Do you know what witch hazel smells like? Well, it smells kinda minty and cottony and plain too. Wow.. will use reast of bottle and I will buy more.</li>
    <li> I love Burts Bees! I bought the scrub also and love the pair of these products. My face feels smooth and refreshed.</li>
    <li> great moisture for sensitive skin. day or night. blends in well, my face just soaks it all up. not oily or greasy, not heavy. very moisturizing. on pump is more than enough for your whole face and neck.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! It feels almost like whipped cream gently sliding onto the skin. My skin is silky soft since I started using it three weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in a high altitude, dry, arid climate. For the last couple of years (since I moved here), my cetaphyl facial moisturizer stopped working. I had red scaly patches of dry cracking skin on my cheeks. I have very reactive, acne prone skin as well. As of this last week, I have noticed a huge reduction in redness. The scaly dryness was gone the first day I applied this to my face. Also as of this week, I noticed my acne clearing up. I should mention that I use this in combination with Burt&#x27;s Bees Citrus facial scrub, and I started both products at the same time, so I&#x27;m not sure which definitively led to the clearing of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first week or two, the results were visible, but mild, as I think my skin was healing from a long period of damage. I&#x27;m so glad I stuck with it! The reason I kept putting it on my skin was mainly because it felt so fantastic. Soft! Not greasy at all. Just silky. One pump of the cream is enough to cover my whole face. I use another for my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In response to the SPF concerns: Most sunscreens are harmful chemicals that can be extremely damaging to sensitive skin. I can only surmise that the company is up on the latest research that shows SPFs might be doing more harm to skin than the sun itself. I live in California, I go out in the sun every day. I come in before I&#x27;m burned. If you are extremely fair skinned, I&#x27;m not sure what will work best for you. For me personally, I was thrilled to find a product without sunscreen. Sunscreen almost always burns and stings my reactive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only con for this is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to reduce a worry line in the center of my forehead as much as cetaphyl did. I might try the night cream for that. At 31 years old, I might just be getting stronger lines anyway. That being said, this has saved my cheeks and my overall skin tone, while cetaphyl did not. For the worry line, I would have given this 4.8 stars. I figure with all of the reviews about the missing SPF, 5 stars can go a little ways toward evening things out. This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.my overall skin tone, while cetaphyl did not. For the worry line, I would have given this 4.8 stars. I figure with all of the reviews about the missing SPF, 5 stars can go a little ways toward evening things out. This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> A gentle, medium-weight moisturizer that absorbs quickly and has a mild scent. And natural!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first bottle, and thus far I love it. A little goes a long way, the GF uses just a half-pump and I use a full pump for full face and throat coverage. It has a silky texture, a mild interesting scent (no fragrance), and absorbs fast. Even with the GF and my \\&quot;combination\\&quot; skin it doesn&#x27;t cause any pore blockage, and my fragrance-sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t react at all to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is small but easy to handle, and the pump is precise (no drip, easy to dispense a partial pump).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After discovering my old standby (Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture) uses parabens and other unsavory ingredients, I set out to find a replacement, and came up with this cream cream for a cost-effective natural lotion.  This Burt&#x27;s Bees has a good EWG \\&quot;skindeep\\&quot; rating (cosmetics database for ingredients and toxicity).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consider the lack of SFP a plus and wouldn&#x27;t have bought this cream if it did have sun protection. I don&#x27;t always want sun protection (modest sun exposure is good for you unless you&#x27;re extremely fair skinned), and most sunblocks have nasty chemicals in them-- hardly something you want to absorb into your facial skin every day! Most lotions with SFP also have a slightly greasy feel to them, and a strange scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to keep using this one. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. I have very dry skin and my face gets flaky during the winter.&lt;br /&gt;But since I&#x27;ve been apply this cream my face has been feeling great.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thin and not oily and think like the other products. No scent whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Love it. This was the second product I bought from Burt&#x27;s Bees (first one was the aftersun soothe and I also love it), and I had already finished one bottle so I bought my second bottle. This was the first cream I found can easy my acne and blemish, which is also cheaper than some other brands. I only use a thin layer on my skin, so it would not be oily even if in summer.</li>
    <li> My  skin is very sensitive, now I have found a moisturer which my skin absoutely loves, no burning, just full of moisture.  A little bit goes a long ways, I use 1/2 pump since a full pump  seems to much.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I like how it dries quick and goes on soft, not thick. I used it every day and would definitely recommend this if you have sensitive skin or like moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t make you break out and hydrates well. No fragrance.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Daily Moisturizing Cream, 1.8 Ounces  ,the cream is very good ,it&#x27;s useful for my face,i like it very much!</li>
    <li> This stuff is yummy for your skin.  The sheer smooth feeling is, I think, unbeatable.  I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers in my life, some ridiculously expensive, and this tops them all. It&#x27;s like light-weight cool silk on your skin.  After buying this once at the store, I just had to find a way to ensure a supply.  Did you know you can sign up on Amazon to receive a favorite item at regular intervals w/no shipping cost?</li>
    <li> Having sensitive skin, I really enjoy this product. It is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t have any perfumes. It doesn&#x27;t sting my face like some moisturizers do.</li>
    <li> Twenty words?  How silly--I can say it in three: very good moisturizer.  For those who cannot use anything containing petroleum derivatives, this is one of the few petroleum-free moisturizers available.</li>
    <li> Lightweight and has worked well for my sensitive, dry skin. I live in Florida and desperately needed a moisturizer that worked for my face without being greasy or causing additional sweat after application. This is my new daily lotion!</li>
    <li> I chose this moisturizer because I have always loved Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  My skin is normal but lately I have been getting dry patches of skin on my face under my eyes.  I usually don&#x27;t use a moisturizer because if I do my skin becomes very oily.  This moisturizer is very creamy and smooth.  It is not greasy at all and it is absorbed into my skin without feeling heavy and oily.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I wish it was tinted, but it smells amazing and isn&#x27;t greasy. Definitely recommend this lotion.</li>
    <li> My 16 year old daughter is plagued with sensitive skin. There are very few products she can use for her face and body. We try different things and are constantly knocking different brands/types off the list. Simple brand moisturizer gave her a horrible rash, pHisoderm gave her serious redness and irritation... it goes on and on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Skin has worked amazingly well for her. She gets dry skin and dry patches on her face in the winter and fall. It gets to the point to where you see so much flaking and it looks like healing scabs almost. This moisturizer gives her the moisturization she needs, without irritating her sensitive skin. She doesn&#x27;t break out from it, it doesn&#x27;t give her the rashy texture that other moisturizers do. It really has been a blessing of a product for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter uses Elidel rx on her face as needed when it gets really bad. Since using this Burt&#x27;s Bees, she doesn&#x27;t need the Elidel nearly as often. That is a huge benefit, especially considering that we have to pay $167 out of pocket every time she needs a refill of the rx.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a 5star product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Mild, goes on smooth. Works just as well as my fancy cream that I spent three time as much on...</li>
    <li> I feel like I am constantly looking for a new moisturizer that will not turn my skin red, break me out, or does not have a ton of chemicals. Burt&#x27;s Bees is usually a good place to start looking, but after this purchase I have come to realize that I just don&#x27;t like most of their products. This moisturizer feels odd on my skin. It goes on thick even when I used a small amount. It feels like it creates a mask and by the next morning, I have a large layer of super dry skin that feels like it is suffocating the new skin underneath. However, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin red which was one of the things I was searching for in a moisturizer. I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Not a lot of stores carry this particular item of the Burt&#x27;s Bees line.  The price I have paid in the past was outrageous but I love the product.  The price from this retailer is wonderful.  Will definately buy again.</li>
    <li> Great everyday lotion. Very good price.</li>
    <li> I guess my acne prone sensitive skin is too sensitive for this..</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees stuff.  Keeps my face soft...</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this face cream!  It is not heavy like &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; would suggest, but not as liquid-like as a lotion.  I was having trouble with dry skin this winter.  Heavier creams were making me break out, and fragrances seemed to irritate the flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion helped my dry skin without either of these problems.  The products with sunscreen seem to irritate my skin as well, so I don&#x27;t mind the lack of sunscreen, as I use this at night, too.  The flaky, itchy patches on my forehead and nose are gone, my skin feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle pump operates smoothly, and does not get a dried clog at the opening every day, like some others I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This truly has no fragrance, it just smells like lotion, the way fragrance-free detergent smells like soap - no perfume odor at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Burt&#x27;s Bees, I hope to use this product for a long time to come!</li>
    <li> I tried this product and also the night cream. It just seems too heavy for my skin and made me break out even worse. I love the idea of the product, but my skin doesn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing effect can be</li>
    <li> I gave this 5 stars because it is, quite simply, amazing.  This moisturizer has everything your skin needs and none of the bad stuff you don&#x27;t need.  It is so pure, it sinks right into your skin and leaves no sticky residue or shine.&lt;br /&gt;So many products we put on our faces have ingredients that are banned in Europe and the UK.  The FDA does not monitor cosmetic or skin care products as carefully as I wish they would.  What you put on your skin can sink into your blood stream, and effect your whole body.&lt;br /&gt;The purity of Burt&#x27;s Bees products is refreshing, and a joy to use.  Yes, I use a vitamin C serum in the morning and retinol at night.  This moisturizer goes on smoothly right over it.  I&#x27;m so glad I found this, and other, Burt&#x27;s Bees Products!</li>
    <li> Bought 2 bottles of this product for my parents, one of whom has sensitive oily skin, the other whom has sensitive dry skin. They both love it and have requested that i buy more for them. My mother claims that it soaks right into the skin without leaving any residue. She has asked me to pick up the sensitve night cream as well. My father noticed that it does not cause any reaction to the skin and leaves it feeling moisturized without feeling heavy. I&#x27;m tempted to pick up a bottle for myself!</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, and uses it every day. When she is happy, life is good. It&#x27;s a great product from a company with a very positive reputation.</li>
    <li> This is gentle enough for my 7 &amp; 8 year olds to use daily but still is very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin.  So far, this has been the only lotion that I have been able to use without breaking out; the product is light enough that my skin doesn&#x27;t feel clogged, but it continues to work all day.  It leaves my skin feeling refreshed, and takes away quite a bit of the redness and irritation.</li>
    <li> This cream doesn&#x27;t irritate my dry rosacea-ridden face, but it&#x27;s hard to tell whether or not it&#x27;s hydrating enough for my flaky skin :-( Have only been using this a few days. Will try to update in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and this lotion works will for me. My skin tends to peal in some areas and using this has prevented that. I also am happy that is does not have a strong smell it its light and feels nice on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin with a LITTLE bit of recurring acne on my cheeks. This lotion caused an immediate breakout (next morning). Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Like small bees very products</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it states on the box \\&quot;Moisturizes without causing redness or irritation\\&quot;, but neither of these statements were true for me. The product seemed to disappear off of my skin after rubbing it in, acting more like a foam than a cream, but it left my skin feeling as tight and dry as when I just stepped out of the shower. Application of the product was accompanied by the familiar redness and irritation that comes with a dehydrated dermis but seeing as how it did not actually moisturize my skin, that&#x27;s to be expected. I was able to mask that redness with Nars Pure Radiant Tinted Moisturizer, but the Burt&#x27;s Bees cream did not interact optimally with the Nars and made it look chalky on my face so I can&#x27;t say that it plays nice with makeup. I&#x27;m giving it two stars because while it didn&#x27;t do what I had hoped, it didn&#x27;t light my face on fire and when you have sensitive skin, that&#x27;s something to be thankful for in avoiding.</li>
    <li> It moistures my face without any odor. I feel good after using it</li>
    <li> UPDATE 12/12/14: After using this for a few months, I went back to the Burt&#x27;s Bees Intense Hydration facial moisturizer. I started noticing my skin feeling \\&quot;dry\\&quot; and having to reapply this a second or third time. Especially now that we&#x27;re getting into the dryer winter months, it just wasn&#x27;t worth it to me since I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin to necessitate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW: Love this. Non-greasy, easy and smooth to apply, face is moisturized all day. I don&#x27;t necessarily have sensitive skin to need this, but I do like this better than their Intense Hydration facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Smells a little weird but it does moisturize very well.&lt;br /&gt;I got it because it doesn&#x27;t contain mineral oil, which can be carcinogenic.</li>
    <li> I feel bad giving this a low review because I really like Burt&#x27;s Bees and I was very happy to see them making a sensitive skin line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure this works just fine for a lot of other people with sensitive skin, but for some reason this made me break out very badly.  It also left sort of a strange, waxy texture on my skin.  If you have dry skin this probably acts as a nice, soothing coating, but on me it just didn&#x27;t work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do just fine with Burt&#x27;s Bee Radiance day cream, however, so I recommend that as an alternative to this one if you are weary of trying it or didn&#x27;t like your own results.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many moisturizers over the years.  This is the first one I have really LOVED.  It does wonderful with combination skin and is not full of parabens.  I hope Burt&#x27;s Bees never quits making this product.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and fairly acne prone skin.  This lotion works great.  It isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out.  During the winter months, when it&#x27;s really dry, I have to put on a little more than usual, but still works great.  Love the pump container too.</li>
    <li> Have always been cautious of putting moisturizer on my face as it is sensitive and breaks out easily. But I have been using this now for over 2 months and have not had any problems and has really made a difference in the appearance of my complexion. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I received a sample packet of this in the mail and it was enough to convince me that I needed to order it. I put it off, using whatever I had, and my combination skin revolted with occasional zits and oilyish t-zone. Just received it and I apply once or twice a day after washing and my face is clear and soft, and feels clean after applying instead of greasy lotiony feeling. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Very good and does not cause allergy problems for me.</li>
    <li> I still experience a bit of redness using this moisturizer, but it fades and is not nearly as bad as that of other products I&#x27;ve used. I will continue my search, but for now, this is the best I can find.</li>
    <li> not moisture at all, I am not using it now, I give it to my husband...</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because this is the best moisturizing cream I have found for my sensitive skin--it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin on my face with a greasy feeling after applying it and takes care of the flaky/dryness that I have.</li>
    <li> my mom had some kind of allergic reaction on her face. Bought it for her and she likes the product a lot!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and usually break out after applying any type of moisturizer. However, I&#x27;ve had no issues after using this for well over two years. It&#x27;s a great product and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Works but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is great, there is no greasy or oily feeling when you put it on.  During the really cold, dry months I need a thicker moisturizer, but for the rest of the year this one works the best.  Leaves my skin is clear and soft.  A little dab goes a long way with this one, I was really surprised how long this little container has lasted.</li>
    <li> Great for my sensitive and oily skin. Moisturizes well and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin at all, and is lightweight and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Fabulous cream, even better than the one in the jar. Little to no fragrance, which I appreciate. I buy this over and over.</li>
    <li> I love Amazon because they always ship early!! Anyways this lotion is fantastic for everyday use for any skin type.  Its not too thick or thin and it has a light natural scent.  I great buy!</li>
    <li> I like Burt&#x27;s Bees products and I like this cream; I only wish they made it with an SPF 20.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, oily skin. Most makeup, lotions and sunscreens give me a rash. This moisturizer is light, smells amazing, doesn&#x27;t make my skin greasy. It makes my fine lines less visible, and gives me a nice glow, not oily at all. Amazing! Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> My teen daughters have tried a lot of mositurizing products. Like a lot a lot. Like &amp;#34;why do we have another product here when you haven&#x27;t finished that one?&amp;#34; Like &amp;#34;are they paying you to wash your face?&amp;#34; Like &amp;#34;did you guys knock off a Sephora?&amp;#34; But - according to them - it&#x27;s tricky finding the right balance moisturizing and over-moisturizing. I&#x27;ll take their word for it. In any case, this is their top choice. &amp;#34;By far&amp;#34;... so that&#x27;s ringing endorsement.</li>
