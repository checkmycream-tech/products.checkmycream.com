      <li>This is the best price I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
      <li>The best scent for a man!</li>

      <li>Excellent product, item as described, quick turnaround and great packaging.  </li>
      <li>All that night, almost every girl I danced with would stick her nose in the nape of my neck (about where I applied the perfume) and rub herself on me while proclaiming how she loved the way I smelled.  </li>
      <li>We are very satisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>So I think that is very important look to who buy the stuff.</li>
      <li>I love that I can order it from the Amazon Marketplace and have it arrive at my home.</li>

      <li>This Obsession received doesn&#x27;t smell same to the original Obsession made by the company.  </li>
      <li>To be perfectly honest, the product I received smelled like wet toilet paper (which isn&#x27;t exactly seductive.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend Obsession for Men.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other colognes and not received nearly such an enthusiastic response from the ladies.  </li>
      <li>If you looking for a new scent or having been using Obsession for sometime give this a try the price and scent can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
      <li>At this point, I&#x27;m not many years away from this becoming my &#x27;old man&#x27; smell, as well.</li>
      <li>Better late than never.</li>
      <li>honest I&#x27;m not happy</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great fragrance.  Have used it for years.</li>
    <li> I DON&#x27;T CARE THAT ITS A MANS COLOGNE!  IM BUYING IT FOR ME BECAUSE THE WOMANS SMELLS AWFUL COMPARED TO THE MENS!  THAT TELLS ME THAT CALVIN SHOULD PROBABLY HIRE A WOMAN TO PICK A WOMANS SCENT BECAUSE THIS ONE IS INTOXICATING AND CAN BE USED AS A  UNISEX SCENT AS I WILL BE USING IT FOR THAT REASON EXCLUSIVELY.</li>
    <li> I was getting ready to go out to a huge dance party one day when a friend asked me if I wanted some cologne.  I told him no, as I did not want to smell like a weirdo guy who wears perfume.  My friend kind of forced it on me though, and I am glad he did.  All that night, almost every girl I danced with would stick her nose in the nape of my neck (about where I applied the perfume) and rub herself on me while proclaiming how she loved the way I smelled.  Seriously, this happened like 5 times that night.  I&#x27;ve tried other colognes and not received nearly such an enthusiastic response from the ladies.  I&#x27;m an obsession man all the way.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand for years. My wife also uses Obsession for women. This is all we ever use.</li>
    <li> I really disgusted because I bought this article for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday, and I didn&#x27;t recive it in the estimated time, in fact, I received it with two weeks almost three of delated and I never recived any apologies or regrets about it. So I think that is very important look to who buy the stuff.</li>
    <li> honest I&#x27;m not happy this product its not smell the same the one I got on the Macy&#x27;s store I think the quality is not the same</li>
    <li> To be perfectly honest, the product I received smelled like wet toilet paper (which isn&#x27;t exactly seductive. Go ahead, try it out for yourself). I bought Obsession from a department store three years back for around $70 I think? and fell in love with it. I was running low so I decided to use the last of my Prime membership to get this, and couldn&#x27;t have been more disappointed. It&#x27;s not even the same shade so my best guess is that it&#x27;s watered down?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy from this reseller again.</li>
    <li> Husband loves the product and the size is great for traveling.</li>
    <li> This product was a meant as a gift and I was informed that it came late.  Better late than never.</li>
    <li> calvin klein obession is a fantastic product. would always recommend to others to use.  and is at a great low price</li>
    <li> The best scent for a man!</li>
    <li> Great; I have been using it for 30 years.</li>
    <li> I tried a sample of this in the store and it is pretty amazing.  I really like the smell of it.</li>
    <li> We are very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> it is a great cologne for men and also its a great price and you dont wait to long to receive it.&lt;br /&gt;i couldnt beleive it cane so quick,,,,</li>
    <li> I am absolutely a fan of Obsession by Calvin Klein. I love that I can order it from the Amazon Marketplace and have it arrive at my home. It is always as advertised and convenient.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000GHVGRI Obsession by Calvin Klein for Men, Eau De Toilette Spray, 6.7 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this scent for the past 32 years ( as long as I&#x27;ve been married) My wife picked it out for me  and I&#x27;ve used it ever since. This is the best price I&#x27;ve ever found. for the 6.7 oz. I put it on in the morning an it last well into the evening. Even after a stressful day at work. If you looking for a new scent or having been using Obsession for sometime give this a try the price and scent can&#x27;t be beat. I highly recommend Obsession for Men.</li>
    <li> Scents are a very personal thing, but I&#x27;ve use this exclusively for decades now. At this point, I&#x27;m not many years away from this becoming my &#x27;old man&#x27; smell, as well. As guess there are worse was to smell in old age.</li>
    <li> SCENT WAS WEAK AND DIDN&#x27;T LAST. THE VENDER, OTC WAS QUICK TO REFUND MY MONEY. I WOULD NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN!</li>
    <li> I have been using Obsession for Men for more years than I can imagine...I keep getting compliments, so I keep using it!  Shopping on line (for price) works.  This WAS the original in the original packing at a MUCH better price than I could get it for locally.</li>
    <li> I used to wear it long time ago and I am coming back, great cologne, very well established, price extremely reasonable &amp; excellent service, will come back.</li>
    <li> the product was exactly as i expected. Plus it arrived on time. I have absolutely no complaints and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This Obsession received doesn&#x27;t smell same to the original Obsession made by the company.  Is this a watered version???? product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, item as described, quick turnaround and great packaging.  I have used this cologne for over 20 years and still enjoy it.</li>
    <li> My favorite men&#x27;s cologne.  I have been wearing for more than thirty years.</li>
