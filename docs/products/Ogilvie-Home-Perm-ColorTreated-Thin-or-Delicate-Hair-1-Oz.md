      <li>and this works incredibly well with my hair...</li>

      <li>The perms themselves are good but the foam is easier to use.</li>
      <li>It came quickly and was packaged perfectly.</li>
      <li>I was happy to find Ogilvie still available and to have great results with it.</li>
      <li>I ever receive the Foam Perm that I ordered I will be happy because I love the product.</li>
      <li>Love it !&lt;</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair</li>
      <li>Glad to get it.</li>
      <li>It has more steps.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure all are satisfactory.</li>
      <li>Because many home permanent companies have gone away, Ogilvie has stayed, thank goodness.  </li>
      <li>You will love the foam perm.  </li>
      <li>Not does my hair look fuller, it looks healthy After having different perms, this is the very best.</li>
      <li>Wish I had better results to share...</li>
      <li>This particular perm is so gentle and gives the best results.  </li>
      <li>this is a really good perm and gentle to your hair</li>
      <li>Easily Overprocesses.  </li>
      <li>it will be easy growing my hair out from a blunt cut, just below chin length cut now that it&#x27;s in spiral curls...</li>
      <li>I was very happy with this perm, my hair is coloured and quite fine, but I found this perm very gentle and would definitely use again</li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s hoping it stays available to us home permers.</li>
      <li>graduated from Beauty School, when I was 17 Years old, and have Given Many Many Professional Perms, and I prefer This Perm to any I have used before !  </li>
      <li>It is better than any professional could do.</li>
      <li>I had used other Ogilvie Perms, and thought they were Good, but this Perm has a Pre Perm Conditioner, and you can time the perm, yourself, so it is not going to overprocess.  </li>
      <li>I was pleased to find this online, they don&#x27;t sell these in our local stores anymore.</li>
      <li>thanks!  </li>
      <li>I use large rollers, and follow the instructions, but still get \\&quot;fried, frizzy\\&quot; hair.</li>
      <li>This is the second time ordering the perms, must have came from a differant supplier this time as instead of the foam that I ordered they were the original and could not get any satisfaction by calling or e-mailing them.</li>
      <li>I like the less steps better.</li>
      <li>Always used this product in the past and they give me a nice soft curl with no frizz.</li>
      <li>the perm looks very soft and feminine...</li>
      <li>am 63 years old, and have always had fine, limp hair.  </li>
      <li>It is hard to find home perms in the stores, so this is a product I love.</li>
      <li>It takes me about 3.5-4 hours to roll my hair and complete the perm process.  </li>
      <li>I have thick, some wavy some straight hair and this perm on larger rods gives my hair much more even styling of natural soft waves which lasts a year.  </li>
      <li>be careful, it can make your hair very curly!</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t the same gentle home perm I  ordered last time although it is close.</li>
      <li>Next time I will go back to my old rods and perm</li>
      <li>Not only does it turn out just the way you want it to at the beginning, it also is long lasting, which means you don&#x27;t need another perm until your hair has grown out  and need a hair cut and a new Ogilvie perm twice a year.  </li>
      <li>I have fine, thin hair and that is the perm I purchase.  </li>

    <li> When I recvd my order it was the wrong perm. I had ordered the foam &amp; recvd the reg.&lt;br /&gt;Even packing slip had my correct order on it. Just not filled correct. Long process but still waiting for my corrected order.BIG BIG disappointment in America RX drug for poor customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I ever receive the Foam Perm that I ordered I will be happy because I love the product. Have been using for years.</li>
    <li> This is the second time ordering the perms, must have came from a differant supplier this time as instead of the foam that I ordered they were the original and could not get any satisfaction by calling or e-mailing them. The perms themselves are good but the foam is easier to use.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the same gentle home perm I  ordered last time although it is close. It has more steps. I like the less steps better. This one didnt last very long because I used rods that were too big. Next time I will go back to my old rods and perm I hope. There is nothing wrong with this perm. It is very good. It came quickly and was packaged perfectly.</li>
    <li> As I said before in my reviews, this product works for me.  I have fine, thin hair and that is the perm I purchase.  Do not get a lot of curl, just get enough body, to help me manage my hair.</li>
    <li> I was pleased to find this online, they don&#x27;t sell these in our local stores anymore. Saves me a lot of time of have to curl my hair daily. Always used this product in the past and they give me a nice soft curl with no frizz. You do need experience setting your hair in the curlers before using it.</li>
    <li> I personally had a terrible experience with this product, because I had an unexperienced hair dresser perming my hair and she left it on too long.</li>
    <li> Only wish I could still get this Foam Perm from Ogilvie.  It&#x27;s a wonderful, easy to use perm that worked great!</li>
    <li> Ogilive home perm for thin,delicate hair is the only one that works.  It is better than any professional could do. Not only does it turn out just the way you want it to at the beginning, it also is long lasting, which means you don&#x27;t need another perm until your hair has grown out  and need a hair cut and a new Ogilvie perm twice a year.  Not does my hair look fuller, it looks healthy After having different perms, this is the very best.</li>
    <li> The box shown on website is not the one sent.  Even tho both perms are for \\&quot;color-treated, thin or delicate hair\\&quot;, the formula has been changed to a \\&quot;new\\&quot; fresher scent, etc.  The one pictured is the one I expected and wanted.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;The gog ate my user&#x27;s instruction&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Where can I find an e-version of it?</li>
    <li> Have been giving myself perms since the &amp;#34;Toni era&amp;#34; and my Mom gave them to us as teens.  You will love the foam perm.  Dripping at a minimum.  Recommend.</li>
    <li> Because many home permanent companies have gone away, Ogilvie has stayed, thank goodness.  This particular perm is so gentle and gives the best results.  Even if your hair is NOT Colored, Treated, Thin or Delicate I&#x27;d recommend using this perm as it gives the best results.  I have thick, some wavy some straight hair and this perm on larger rods gives my hair much more even styling of natural soft waves which lasts a year.  I only perm once a year.  My hair is shoulder length.  It takes me about 3.5-4 hours to roll my hair and complete the perm process.  I am very careful how I roll the ends of my hair to avoid frizz.  Try this perm it is wonderful.  It has a before and after conditioner too.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and this works incredibly well with my hair...thanks!  the perm looks very soft and feminine...it will be easy growing my hair out from a blunt cut, just below chin length cut now that it&#x27;s in spiral curls...before it was flat and ugly!!!  All I have to do is run my hands through the curl, put a leave in conditioner on it and out the door I go!</li>
    <li> Product came sooner than expected and just as advertised. Very happy with it and will buy from them again.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find home perms in the stores, so this is a product I love. Glad to get it.</li>
    <li> be careful, it can make your hair very curly!, use big roll and short time. I would not use it again, it make my hair very dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure all are satisfactory. I thought I was ordering the foam perm so I might not be as happy as i wanted to be. Not their fault but mine</li>
    <li> always use this &amp; I bleach my hair too, but the perm does not hurt my hair.</li>
    <li> I had used the Toni home perms for over 40 years, and was extremely happy with them and very disappointed when the company closed.  Ogilvie seemed like an alternative, but after several tries I am still unhappy.  I use large rollers, and follow the instructions, but still get \\&quot;fried, frizzy\\&quot; hair. I do color my hair, but don&#x27;t do that till a couple of weeks have passed after the perm. I am afraid I will have to go to the beautyshop...but I tried that a few times and always went back to my Toni. Wish I had better results to share...but I don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> this is a really good perm and gentle to your hair</li>
    <li> This is a Wonderful Product !&lt;br /&gt;I am 63 years old, and have always had fine, limp hair.  Sraight as a String.  Easily Overprocesses.  I had used other Ogilvie Perms, and thought they were Good, but this Perm has a Pre Perm Conditioner, and you can time the perm, yourself, so it is not going to overprocess.  And a Post Perm Conditioner.  Love it !&lt;br /&gt;I graduated from Beauty School, when I was 17 Years old, and have Given Many Many Professional Perms, and I prefer This Perm to any I have used before !  WORKS FOR ME !!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using home perms for about thirty years. Lately they are impossible to find in local stores and many brands have been discontinued. I was happy to find Ogilvie still available and to have great results with it. Here&#x27;s hoping it stays available to us home permers.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this perm, my hair is coloured and quite fine, but I found this perm very gentle and would definitely use again</li>
    <li> Just what I needed...Perfect for here and there curls.</li>
