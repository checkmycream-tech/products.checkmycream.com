### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very impressed!</li>
      <li>lol.    </li>
      <li>Sooo basically this smells great.</li>
      <li>These have become my signature scents and whenever someone at work asks what smells so good, everyone says my name.</li>
      <li>She loved it.</li>
      <li>The spray smells good</li>
      <li>Chances are, you&#x27;ll love it though!</li>
      <li>and I will have to buy more!</li>
      <li>Love the product!</li>
      <li>GLAD</li>
      <li>so Inlove there&#x27;s nothing better than this smell for me</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>(I have to know this because my profession is Avon Sales Representative)I love the spray, and will probably love the perfume as well.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff</li>
      <li>We do love the smell of this, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me like some perfumes do..</li>
      <li>Love this stuff &amp;#60;3</li>
      <li>In 2 hours the scent is pretty subdued which if you want to smell like a cotton candy stand isn&#x27;t good.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a nice mild scent.</li>
      <li>(might I add that Pupperdog does an excellent job of packaging their items, there was NO way this was going to get damaged on its way here, however, had I not as careful as I was in opening, I could have punctured the can with my old car key)and sprayed some on my wrists and was absolutely THRILLED!</li>
      <li>If you love to smell sweet as candy....just buy this.</li>
      <li>USE LIGHTLY</li>
      <li>For those who don&#x27;t know the difference between a perfume and a body spray, the perfume is always more intense, more concentrated than the spray.</li>
      <li>It says on the back: A wonderful blend of spun sugar and creamy vanilla combined with notes of tender strawberries, lush raspberries and clean musk.</li>
      <li>This was actually a three pack which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
      <li>I always wanted to smell sweet like this, and when this arrived today, I eagerly unwrapped it</li>
      <li>(Incedentally all my favorite scents, no wonder i like this SO much..)    </li>
      <li>it does smells sweet though.</li>
      <li>★★ smells good enough to eat...</li>
      <li>Other than that it is a great scented spray.</li>
      <li>I gave her benadryl that night to calm the hives.</li>
      <li>It smells good for a little bit, but the scent fades away.</li>
      <li>Ever since I was a little girl, I have loved this smell.</li>
      <li>The first two ingredients are SD Alchohol 40 and isobutane.</li>
      <li>I love body sprays especially since they don&#x27;t give me headaches like perfumes!</li>
      <li>smells EXACTLY like</li>
      <li>Amazed that it really does smell like cotton candy!</li>
      <li>Very feminine and girly scent.</li>
      <li>Really?</li>
      <li>Really.</li>
      <li>I was afraid to buy perfume online just because I couldn&#x27;t smell it first, but the price was fair and it seemed promising.</li>
      <li>I also love Pink Sugar by Aqualina and Pretty in Pink (a discontinued VS scent).</li>
      <li>I LOVE this scent and am anxiously awaiting the matching perfume.</li>
      <li>this smelled completely like cotton candy.</li>
      <li>If you want to smell like candy, buy this spray, a little goes a long way and you will LOVE it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so cheaply priced that even if you do not like it, you can throw it in the trash or give it to someone else at a small loss.</li>

    <li> This product is dangerous. The first two ingredients are SD Alchohol 40 and isobutane. It also has Propane in it. My 10 yr old daughter received it from a friend for a birthday present along with some other cosmetics. She had a severe allergic reaction to it. She broke out in severe hives and could not sleep. I gave her benadryl that night to calm the hives. Days later she had an Anaphylaxis attack. She broke out in hives again and her temperature shot up to 104 degrees. This product should be outlawed! Propane? Really?</li>
    <li> If you love to smell sweet as candy....just buy this. It&#x27;s so cheaply priced that even if you do not like it, you can throw it in the trash or give it to someone else at a small loss. Chances are, you&#x27;ll love it though!</li>
    <li> Sooo basically this smells great. I was afraid to buy perfume online just because I couldn&#x27;t smell it first, but the price was fair and it seemed promising. I love this stuff and I will have to buy more!</li>
    <li> Ever since I was a little girl, I have loved this smell. I didn&#x27;t know what perfume smelled like this (this scent puts me in mind of sweet-tarts candy). I always wanted to smell sweet like this, and when this arrived today, I eagerly unwrapped it (might I add that Pupperdog does an excellent job of packaging their items, there was NO way this was going to get damaged on its way here, however, had I not as careful as I was in opening, I could have punctured the can with my old car key)and sprayed some on my wrists and was absolutely THRILLED! I LOVE this scent and am anxiously awaiting the matching perfume. For those who don&#x27;t know the difference between a perfume and a body spray, the perfume is always more intense, more concentrated than the spray. (I have to know this because my profession is Avon Sales Representative)I love the spray, and will probably love the perfume as well. If you want to smell like candy, buy this spray, a little goes a long way and you will LOVE it.</li>
    <li> When I looked at the description it said 3 2.5 oz and that&#x27;s why I ordered it for this price.  When I got it I only received one and was puzzled. I checked the website afterwards and I didn&#x27;t see that description anymore.  The spray smells good but it&#x27;s too pricey when I could go to Walmart and get it for $3.00</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 9-year-old granddaughter who loves cotton candy. Amazed that it really does smell like cotton candy! She loved it.</li>
    <li> I ALWAYS get compliments when I wear or spray this scent. I absolutely love it. I also love Pink Sugar by Aqualina and Pretty in Pink (a discontinued VS scent). These have become my signature scents and whenever someone at work asks what smells so good, everyone says my name. Very feminine and girly scent. Not overpowering. I love body sprays especially since they don&#x27;t give me headaches like perfumes!</li>
    <li> I bought this at my local Family Dollar Store, it&#x27;s not overpowering.. it does smells sweet though. My daughter always says \\&quot;mommy you&#x27;re wearing the cotton candy perfume again, i can tell.. you smell like candy.\\&quot; then she adds \\&quot;you&#x27;re going to get attacked by the bees..\\&quot; which i never have.. lol.    It says on the back: A wonderful blend of spun sugar and creamy vanilla combined with notes of tender strawberries, lush raspberries and clean musk. (Incedentally all my favorite scents, no wonder i like this SO much..)    My daughter has asked if she can have some too. We do love the smell of this, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me like some perfumes do.. it&#x27;s a nice mild scent.</li>
    <li> OHHHHHH MYYYYY GOOOODDDDDD DOOOO NOTTTTT BUYYY THISSSSS TERRRIBLLLEEEE SMELLLLLLLLLLLL YOU WILLL GET SICKKKKKKKK</li>
    <li> Love this stuff &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Very impressed!★★★★★ smells good enough to eat...</li>
    <li> Really. Sometimes I just sit there and smell the bottle it&#x27;s that close to cotton candy. However, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last that long on me</li>
    <li> it smells like sweaty clowns and i literally threw it away the second i opened it. the smell made me want to puke it&#x27;s terrible</li>
    <li> I use this occasionally on my clothing. I like the &#x27;distant&#x27; smell of cotton candy from the carnival it leaves. If alot is used at one time, it is too overpowering though. USE LIGHTLY</li>
    <li> I HAVE THIS (friend gave it to me) AND IM DO GLAD I FOUND IT!!!!!!! This is a dream and if you don&#x27;t want to put it on you! You can can put it as an air freshener for your room! 😍😍 so Inlove there&#x27;s nothing better than this smell for me smells EXACTLY like cotton candy definetely recommend this (ESPECAILLY for such a low price</li>
    <li> It smells good for a little bit, but the scent fades away. Also, $5+ is a lot to be paying for this small little can. One more thing, when you sweat with this on, it creates a very unpleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want to smell &#x27;yummy&#x27; ? Everyone I know does. Anyway the 1 and only complaint I had with this spray is it doesn&#x27;t last long enough. In 2 hours the scent is pretty subdued which if you want to smell like a cotton candy stand isn&#x27;t good. Other than that it is a great scented spray.</li>
    <li> this smelled completely like cotton candy. I will be reordering this</li>
    <li> This was actually a three pack which was a pleasant surprise. Love the product!</li>
    <li> It smelled horribly. It sounded appealing from the previous reviewers, but it smells horrible. I do not recommend.</li>
