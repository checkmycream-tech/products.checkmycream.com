      <li>he venido adquirendo articulos los cuales  son de buena calidad satisfanciendo la necesidades del comprador, pero siempre exiten los riesgos en compras a distancias como por ejemplo; la plancha para cabello true ceramic pro comprada desde venezuela con el numero de guia MAR0109346141, llego dañada a destino, no prende y segun las condiciones</li>
      <li>, this is a true ceramic pro.</li>

      <li>The problem was they got so hot</li>
      <li>I bought these when they first came out and</li>
      <li>I HAD FIRST RECEIVED ONE</li>
      <li>I ordered a TCP when they first came out.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought so many flat irons that don&#x27;t work</li>
      <li>Thanks for shipping very fast.</li>
      <li>so I am not sure if that is good.  </li>

      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>The only thing I use before I even dry my hair is a leave in spray conditioner, nothing more and it lasts.</li>
      <li>very fast shipping, straightens very well, i just have a little problem, my true ceramic have a plate loose, and have a burnt smell while iam using it even if iam using the medium level hot, everything else</li>
      <li>Because I only lasted two years exactly.</li>

      <li>The plates are not closed.  </li>
      <li>I was totally dissappointed with this item, not even going to call them flat irons, because flat irons are suppose to get hot.....</li>
      <li>and it does not dry my hair.</li>

    <li> This Iron is just the best. Use it and see the results for yourself...it leaves the hair so bright and soft you won&#x27;t belive it.</li>
    <li> This True Ceramic Pro is as good as a $200 one.  It heats up quickly, makes my hair shiny, and is very easy to use.  My daughter bought one and recommended it to me so I purchased one through Amazon and am thrilled with the price and quality. The ceramic end does not damage my hair.</li>
    <li> TRUE CERAMIC PRO Infared Ionic Styler Flat Iron 1\\&quot; (W/FREE GIFT)&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I have been using the True Ceramic Pro for years. My old one started acting up (the power would not always turn on). I could not go without it so I ordered another one. I use it because my hair does not frizz anymore and it does not dry my hair.</li>
    <li> Thanks for shipping very fast. I tried it today, I feel satisfied with it. I hope my daughter will love it.Thanks.</li>
    <li> I ordered a TCP when they first came out.  Unfortunately they are no longer available.  Mine has died after 8 long years of heavy use.  I tried ordering this one and am dissapointed.  It is not the same.  Does  not heat up to the temperature it should.  and different packaging, makes me wonder.</li>
    <li> I have used this item only a couple of times but I am so far very satisfied. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> Srs Amazon.Desde hace tiempo he venido adquirendo articulos los cuales  son de buena calidad satisfanciendo la necesidades del comprador, pero siempre exiten los riesgos en compras a distancias como por ejemplo; la plancha para cabello true ceramic pro comprada desde venezuela con el numero de guia MAR0109346141, llego dañada a destino, no prende y segun las condiciones de reclamo y devolucion hay q cancelar el envio de venezuela a amazon, tambien dice que si no es vendida por amazon tendra que ser desvuelta donde la adquirio osea a otra tienda.  Este producto fue comprado con los cupos electronicos de cadivi el cual es limitado(400$) razon por la cual no puedo desvolverlo ya q no cuento con mas cupos.    Nota: En vista de estas serie de condiciones no me quedo otra que resolver el problema con la plancha contactando servicio tecnico.           Sin mas a que hacer referencia me despido de uds tomando en cuenta q fui el afectado en dicha compra.    Giovanny Quintero.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought so many flat irons that don&#x27;t work that I think I&#x27;ve spent three times the amount of money this iron costs for nothing. My mom bought this one and I take it from her everytime I wash my hair to flat iron it. And it looks natural... It doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s flat ironed... It makes my hair look healthy. The only thing I use before I even dry my hair is a leave in spray conditioner, nothing more and it lasts.</li>
    <li> I need to buy another one of these.  The one I have still works great but, the red is wearing off the plates so I am not sure if that is good.  Still it leaves my hair so smooth and frizz free!  I have naturally curly thick hair and this is the best!  I have bought a Chi and will never again.  TCP allows you to control temp, Chi doesn&#x27;t and the Chi made my hair smell burnt and was not nearly as shiny.  This thing is quick in one pass.  Will buy another soon.  I have had this one for at least 7 years.  Swear by it and my hair is so difficult but it us wonderful.</li>
    <li> The True Ceramic Pro hair styling tool is amazing! My hair is very curly, yet it straightens easily, and STAYS STRAIGHT! Wonderful product. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I owned this bfore anf gave it away, and everyone in my family loves it, this is a true ceramic pro. I bought these when they first came out and some onf them look different i just bought 3 and received very fast, will buy more for my family members</li>
    <li> I am not satisfied with the product.   The plates are not closed.  Not heated sufficiently   Very bad.   Buy something better.  I lost my money.</li>
    <li> very fast shipping, straightens very well, i just have a little problem, my true ceramic have a plate loose, and have a burnt smell while iam using it even if iam using the medium level hot, everything else this flat really straight</li>
    <li> Es bastante liviana y cómoda, alcanza altas tempraturas muy rápidamente y me deja el cabello realmente suave, con un alisado natural. ¡La recomiendo!..</li>
    <li> I love the True Ceramic Pro. This is the best hair straightner I have ever used. I have used very expensive straightners and all they do is damage my hair and make is feel like straw.

    <li> I am completely satisfied with this product. it straightens my hair on the first try! It only takes seconds for the flat iron to heat up to 400 degrees. it&#x27;s nice having straight, frizz-free hair. This product is truly amazing!</li>
    <li> Best iron so far. Lasts longer than most, and works a lot better than most. I feel that it smooths the hair much quicker, therefore less damage. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I get it for my daughter she loved it and used it every time she need it this item has I thumps with us</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. Love it. Have had it for many years. No problems. Long cord and high heat setting.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think that this is the true, True Ceramic Pro. I purchased a pair of the True Ceramic Pro flat irons about 2 years ago, and I loved them. The problem was they got so hot the spring in the handle just gave out. I have searched for another pair for a long time. Then I ran across the........&lt;br /&gt;True Ceramic Pro Infrared Ionic Styler AS SEEN ON TV $49.46...... \\&quot;infrared\\&quot;  must mean \\&quot;not hot at all\\&quot;!!!!!. I was totally dissappointed with this item, not even going to call them flat irons, because flat irons are suppose to get hot.....don&#x27;t waste your time nor $$$</li>
    <li> OMG! The Ceramic Pro Flat Iron is great! It leaves my hair so smooth and it definately does not make it dry. I totally recommend everyone to get the Ceramic Pro. I have not been to a hair stylist in ages!</li>
    <li> THE IRON IS EVERYTHING I EXPECTED.  I HAD FIRST RECEIVED ONE THAT MAL- FUNTIONED HOWEVER, THE COMPANY RESPONDED RAPIDLY TO REPLACE IT THANK YOU.</li>
    <li> Hi!  I bought the \\&quot;True Ceramic Pro Infrared Ionic Styler\\&quot; that included a Free Gift, and you sent me \\&quot;Divina Hair\\&quot;, a totally different item.  I need you to send me what I bought.  Thanks  Maria Carmela</li>
    <li> While it worked, it was really great.&lt;br /&gt;My wife was delighted, since it really helped her with her hair doing.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a true quality product, one that fits it&#x27;s publicity.&lt;br /&gt;Why do I rate it so low? Because I only lasted two years exactly. After that ¡zap!, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on... no problems with the electricity this time, it just died.</li>
