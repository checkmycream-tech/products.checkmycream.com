      <li>I love Nubian Heritage products!</li>
      <li>Very good for healing rough skin anywhere on the face or body...smells great too!</li>
      <li>This soap smells totally amazing, and has a silky emollient feel.</li>
      <li>Be sure to remove the oil your skin produces (I use blotting papers or tissues) so that it doesn&#x27;t just sit there on your face and make a good environment for pimples.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like to work this in my face anyway to give myself a nice face</li>
      <li>my mom liked it as well.</li>
      <li>Pleasant, light sandalwood scent.</li>
      <li>It melts very easily from the warmth of your hands.</li>
      <li>This fragrance is strong!</li>
      <li>Perfect for post shave calming of the skin as well as general day to day face protection.</li>
      <li>This is the best facial product I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love the Nubian Heritage line.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have that kind of time in your morning regimen, this would be a fantastic night cream with something lighter during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>like to put this moisturizer on while my face is still damp for the most absorption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And it smells fabulous!</li>
      <li>I will be ordering many more.</li>
      <li>Good consistency &amp; very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>but I have a coffee mug warmer that I use to liquefy it before I shower and when I come out its easy to use to-</li>
      <li>Originally, I was going to return it because it smelled too strong, but it turns out I was using too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, realize that this moisturizer will absorb very well, but your skin will still produce oil that kind of sits on the surface.</li>
      <li>Both this and the shea butter infused with Frankincense and Myrrh are fabulous.  </li>
      <li>Not too greasy leaves skin feeling clean and smooth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve definitely liked other body butters and oils better, but this was just OK.</li>
      <li>This shea butter has a nice light natural smell.</li>
      <li>Great for dry skin.</li>
      <li>This moisturizer has a lot going for it: it&#x27;s 98%  natural, it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin or cause breakouts, and it&#x27;s very rich!</li>
      <li>(I use MUFE HD, L&#x27;oreal True Match, MAC Face &amp; Body, and Clinique Mattifying powder).</li>
      <li>Excellent moisturizer for African American skin.</li>
      <li>This product seemed kinda pricey to me but it was worth the money.</li>
      <li>I would reccomend using it right after washing face to hold in moisture and then try to wait 10-15 min before applying ay makeup, otherwise eye makeup might run.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m personally alright with it, but it is a very strong &amp; lingering smell.</li>
      <li>Very much like this product.</li>
      <li>Make sure to blot WELL after applying your makeup and to set with a mattifying powder in your oily areas and things willstay under control for several hours.</li>
      <li>I used the nubian heritage shea butter scented with papaya and coconut first and found the smell way too fruity and overpowering.</li>
      <li>I generally rub a pea-sized (or smaller) amount between my palms or keep it in a warm area so that it is easier to spread.  </li>
      <li>I love these subtle, warm fragrances from naturally derived sources.</li>
      <li>and it becomes much easier to use).</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin</li>
      <li>works VERY well under makeup.  </li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re using it for small areas it works very well, and smells amazing.</li>
      <li>My husband has a sensitive nose and he really couldn&#x27;t stand it.</li>
      <li>I put one of my favorite scented natural oils in it after melting it down and finished the pot.</li>
      <li>So if you&#x27;re sensitive, be warned!</li>
      <li>People have been commenting on how clear and glowing my skin is-</li>
      <li>I have been looking for years for a natural oil/butter for my skin</li>
      <li>and this stuff jsut sinks right in.</li>
      <li>I use them daily on my hands and feet----very rich, soothing, with  minimal ingredients.  </li>
      <li>This has helped restore my facial volume, calm down irritation, and even my skintone.  </li>

    <li> Both this and the shea butter infused with Frankincense and Myrrh are fabulous.  I use them daily on my hands and feet----very rich, soothing, with  minimal ingredients.  I love these subtle, warm fragrances from naturally derived sources.</li>
    <li> It smells like play doh and is a bit hard to work with. The smell doesn&#x27;t entirely dissipate, either. I&#x27;ve definitely liked other body butters and oils better, but this was just OK. I put one of my favorite scented natural oils in it after melting it down and finished the pot.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is strong! My husband has a sensitive nose and he really couldn&#x27;t stand it. I&#x27;m personally alright with it, but it is a very strong &amp; lingering smell. So if you&#x27;re sensitive, be warned! Otherwise, very good shea butter. Good consistency &amp; very moisturizing. If you can stand the smell, go for it!</li>
    <li> I am half nigerian/ brazilian with dark skin, very prone to dryness. I have been looking for years for a natural oil/butter for my skin and this is it. I used the nubian heritage shea butter scented with papaya and coconut first and found the smell way too fruity and overpowering. This shea butter has a nice light natural smell. If you like the smell of sandalwood you&#x27;ll like this. I use this on my face and body after using african black soap and my skin is moisturized without being too oily. People have been commenting on how clear and glowing my skin is- i will use for the rest of my life! (as a side note, it is a little hard to use but I have a coffee mug warmer that I use to liquefy it before I shower and when I come out its easy to use to- alternatively you can mircrowave it for about a minute and it becomes much easier to use).</li>
    <li> This product gives very good hydration to individuals suffering with psoriasis. The dry scaly patches are relieved instantaneously with this product.</li>
    <li> Smells a little like playdough in the jar, hence the 3 stars. Otherwise a great product. Will probably get the Honey Black Seed one next time. I love Nubian Heritage products!</li>
    <li> Great hydrating cream.  I love it!  Excellent moisturizer for African American skin. Not too greasy leaves skin feeling clean and smooth.</li>
    <li> This product seemed kinda pricey to me but it was worth the money. I apply it once daily and it actually started to tone my skin up. my mom liked it as well.</li>
    <li> Very much like this product. Its help my skin a lot. Would recommend it too anyone. Especially for wrinkles and all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had good expierences using ths  moisturizer. You only need a small amount for going over your face.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product - I mix it with a few drops of essential oil to treat my psoriasis.  Works very well.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the Nubian Heritage line. The body butters feel awesome on the skin. Not greasy but moisturizing. Great scent too.</li>
    <li> Quality Shea Butter. Pleasant, light sandalwood scent. Not whipped. I think, after reading reviews that suggested this product was hard, some people expected it would be whipped. It is supposed to be compact. It melts very easily from the warmth of your hands. The additives do not seem to affect the consistency.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has a lot going for it: it&#x27;s 98%  natural, it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin or cause breakouts, and it&#x27;s very rich! This has helped restore my facial volume, calm down irritation, and even my skintone.  And it smells fabulous! Originally, I was going to return it because it smelled too strong, but it turns out I was using too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some advice on using it as a moisturizer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re oily-skinned like me, realize that this moisturizer will absorb very well, but your skin will still produce oil that kind of sits on the surface. Be sure to remove the oil your skin produces (I use blotting papers or tissues) so that it doesn&#x27;t just sit there on your face and make a good environment for pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to put this moisturizer on while my face is still damp for the most absorption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need the smallest amount. I generally rub a pea-sized (or smaller) amount between my palms or keep it in a warm area so that it is easier to spread.  If you don&#x27;t let it melt, it will be grainy and you&#x27;ll have to work it in your face. I like to work this in my face anyway to give myself a nice face massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wait 15-30 minutes prior to putting on makeup so you can remove any residue or extra moisturizer you may have put on if you were being too generous.  If you don&#x27;t have that kind of time in your morning regimen, this would be a fantastic night cream with something lighter during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works VERY well under makeup.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it balling up under oil-free foundations (I use MUFE HD, L&#x27;oreal True Match, MAC Face &amp; Body, and Clinique Mattifying powder). I don&#x27;t use face primers (I only use eye makeup primer),so I don&#x27;t know if that would change the results. Remember, the oil from your skin will still come through (this isn&#x27;t mattifying), but not in crazy amounts. Make sure to blot WELL after applying your makeup and to set with a mattifying powder in your oily areas and things willstay under control for several hours.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a moisterizer for my dace that would hydrate but would not cause breakouts or irritate my eyes. I use this every morning. Avery small amount goes a long way. I have very oily skin and this stuff jsut sinks right in. I would reccomend using it right after washing face to hold in moisture and then try to wait 10-15 min before applying ay makeup, otherwise eye makeup might run.</li>
    <li> The shea is solid and you rub your fingers over to release the oils. If you&#x27;re using it for small areas it works very well, and smells amazing. To do your entire body is time consuming; I would try the Nubian cream instead.  I do love all the Nubian products!</li>
    <li> This soap smells totally amazing, and has a silky emollient feel. I use it for body, face, and hair. Great for dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial product I have ever used. Perfect for post shave calming of the skin as well as general day to day face protection. I will be ordering many more.</li>
    <li> Nubian Heritage have awesome skin products</li>
    <li> This is the BEST stuff ever. I use this stuff on a daily basis for multiple purposes. Very good for healing rough skin anywhere on the face or body...smells great too!</li>
