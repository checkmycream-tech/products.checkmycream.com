      <li>Pigment is nice and stays put for hours.</li>
      <li>The sparkly colors are really nice and have always blended well for me.</li>
      <li>Really nice package all together.</li>
      <li>The pigments where nice, the variety between mattes and shimmers.</li>
      <li>But I took a chance and ordered this for a nice change of pace.</li>
      <li>This item came in perfect condition, no one eyeshadow was broken, so very happy about that.</li>
      <li>I love that it has both matte and shimmer colors.</li>
      <li>The more matte ones don&#x27;t stick as well, but I&#x27;ve managed to make them work.</li>
      <li>I love my Fash pallette.  </li>
      <li>this is perfect for a throw in the bag travel item, but it&#x27;s not a professional set.</li>
      <li>If you are experienced in make-up and you looking for something more professional quality...keep shopping.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll love it with all the choices of colors available in the palette.  </li>
      <li>Overall there are some very good colors that are in it.  </li>
      <li>something that wasn&#x27;t a huge dent in my pocketbook but still a nice set of shadows that I could have lots of fun with and thats what I got.</li>
      <li>Also the hinge of the eyeshadow box broke easily.</li>
      <li>The FASH pallet is a good buy, the colors are vibrant and easily applied.</li>
      <li>It has both matte &amp; shimmer colors and the eyeshadow goes on pretty smooth and even more vibrant when used with a good primer.</li>
      <li>Actual shadows are about the size of a dime but look great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
      <li>I wonder if the payment of the product I ordered was accepted  NEW 2011 FASH Eyeshadow, 88 Warm Matte and Shimmer Palette  </li>
      <li>My sister had these sparkling and bold rich eye colors that I envied.</li>
      <li>the colors are vibrant, i bought that and a set of brushes from fash and let me tell you, the best 25 bucks ive ever spent!</li>
      <li>There are so many colors that the possibilities are endless, is a nice size so it can fit inside a purse.</li>
      <li>The make up came in really quick.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Amazon is always a pleasure to shop on and provides really quick service.</li>
      <li>The last is amazing when used with primer.</li>
      <li>I would have liked for the color trays to have been bigger.</li>
      <li>Had to leave it open and let it air out for about a day before that smell  wore off, but Really nice all together.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fun if you like to change your make-up often, or use as during Halloween.</li>
      <li>The only thing is that the mirror looks like it was made of plastics, so I prefer to use my own mirror.</li>
      <li>I love all of the colors and its very fun to try all the different colors.</li>
      <li>I have mostly used the earth tone colors and on my dark skin it did an okay job</li>
      <li>Use an eyeshadow primer to make bold colors really pop.</li>
      <li>but I really like the ones I do use so its worth it, and for the price you just can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
      <li>It is exactly what is shown in the picture.</li>
      <li>I love the different colors.</li>
      <li>There are some colors that look really similar, maybe even repeats, but they are colors I&#x27;ve used a lot of so far, so it&#x27;s nice to have doubles.</li>
      <li>I am no professional, just love playing with make-up.</li>
      <li>I really like this item it came to me pretty fast</li>
      <li>and I have pretty sensitive skin, but if you&#x27;re sensitive to strong smells, this might not work very well for you.</li>
      <li>The colors do have a certain smell to them.</li>
      <li>She will be very excited.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The eyeshadow is great but the box came with eyeshadow powder all over it and an eyeshadow was broken.</li>
      <li>Great selection of eyeshadow colors but three were broken in transit.  </li>
      <li>The shadows are very silkly to the touch and very pigmented.  </li>
      <li>and it got dragged with me as I drove a good hour to another city, and afterwards not a single color was broken.</li>
      <li>all i can say is wow.</li>
      <li>The only thing I disliked about this palette was that I would fall in love with the colors and then run out of it.</li>
      <li>The small pallet makes way for easy handling.</li>
      <li>The colors are different than the usual colors offered in most 88 color palettes.</li>
      <li>there are shimmery colors, and matte colors, and they stay on very well as long as you use a primer.</li>
      <li>Overall, this palette was exactly what I thought I was getting when I ordered it, and it was well spent money, but I figured if you are looking at these comments as much as I did before buying this, you&#x27;ll want to know the good and bad things about it before spending your hard-earned money.</li>
      <li>and i was a little bummed at how small they were, only because i LOVE THAT STUFF!</li>

<li> and i was a little bummed at how small they were, only because i LOVE THAT STUFF!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only been getting into make up alot if the last few years, lots of high end shadows for me.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if there really is a way to prevent this from happening.  </li>
<li> I took the other review advice and bought a eyeshadow primer to use with this product.</li>
<li> I have other brand pallettes, but when it&#x27;s time to apply makeup, Fash is always the one I select.  </li>
<li> The only bad thing I can say is, it smells like fresh plastic.</li>
<li> Due to poor packaging by the manufacture the eye shadow was shaken loose and mixed together at time of delivery.</li>
<li> After reading lots of comments of different eyeshadow palettes, I was expecting all colors to be crashed because of the shipping, but NOTHING was broken.</li>
<li> the colors were tiny and some were broken and unusable.</li>
<li> When I received the package it was messy and one on the colors were broke.</li>
<li> What I did not like is that one shadow color was broken when it arrived, and some of the colors seem to be to shimmery and not rich.  </li>
<li> You can definitely wear them on a day to day basis or go crazy fancy.</li>
<li> so i didn&#x27;t have the issue of broken shadows either.</li>
<li> none of it was broken up.</li>
<li> The color come in dime size option, the package arrive without any problems and none were broken.</li>
<li> Some of the colors was completely useless.</li>

    <li> I love this palette! The colors are different than the usual colors offered in most 88 color palettes. It has both matte &amp; shimmer colors and the eyeshadow goes on pretty smooth and even more vibrant when used with a good primer. The price is great so I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Received product in a satisfactory time. Due to poor packaging by the manufacture the eye shadow was shaken loose and mixed together at time of delivery. Some of the colors was completely useless.</li>
    <li> I really like this item it came to me pretty fast ans none of it was broken up. I love that it has both matte and shimmer colors. I would buy this again in a heartbeat</li>
    <li> all i can say is wow. i got the eyeshadow palette  and i was a little bummed at how small they were, only because i LOVE THAT STUFF! there are shimmery colors, and matte colors, and they stay on very well as long as you use a primer. the colors are vibrant, i bought that and a set of brushes from fash and let me tell you, the best 25 bucks ive ever spent! it also was all bubble wrapped and stuff so i didn&#x27;t have the issue of broken shadows either.</li>
    <li> This palette has an amazing selection of shimmer and matte eyeshadows to mix and match. Pigment is nice and stays put for hours.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been getting into make up alot if the last few years, lots of high end shadows for me.

    <li> I got this looking to experiment with some fun-colored eye shadows, which is exactly what it is perfect for. It is exactly what is shown in the picture. I love all of the colors and its very fun to try all the different colors. There are some colors that look really similar, maybe even repeats, but they are colors I&#x27;ve used a lot of so far, so it&#x27;s nice to have doubles. The sparkly colors are really nice and have always blended well for me. The more matte ones don&#x27;t stick as well, but I&#x27;ve managed to make them work. I do wish there were darker brown colors though. Also, I brought this palette to school in my backpack to reapply my makeup after swimming, but then I forgot about it and it got dragged with me as I drove a good hour to another city, and afterwards not a single color was broken. The colors do have a certain smell to them. They&#x27;ve never harmed my skin and I have pretty sensitive skin, but if you&#x27;re sensitive to strong smells, this might not work very well for you. Overall, this palette was exactly what I thought I was getting when I ordered it, and it was well spent money, but I figured if you are looking at these comments as much as I did before buying this, you&#x27;ll want to know the good and bad things about it before spending your hard-earned money.</li>
    <li> Actual shadows are about the size of a dime but look great. Use an eyeshadow primer to make bold colors really pop. Definitely would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The only thing I disliked about this palette was that I would fall in love with the colors and then run out of it. It wasn&#x27;t enough. It&#x27;s fun if you like to change your make-up often, or use as during Halloween.</li>
    <li> I took the other review advice and bought a eyeshadow primer to use with this product. The last is amazing when used with primer. The colors are metallic but not overly so. You can definitely wear them on a day to day basis or go crazy fancy. I look forward to using all the colors.</li>
    <li> The FASH pallet is a good buy, the colors are vibrant and easily applied. The small pallet makes way for easy handling.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good. I was surpised. After reading lots of comments of different eyeshadow palettes, I was expecting all colors to be crashed because of the shipping, but NOTHING was broken. Becides, for me, colors look even brighter then on the picture. The only thing is that the mirror looks like it was made of plastics, so I prefer to use my own mirror.</li>
    <li> This item came in perfect condition, no one eyeshadow was broken, so very happy about that. There are so many colors that the possibilities are endless, is a nice size so it can fit inside a purse. The price is great and the product is very good in my opinion. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> After watching all those YouTube videos, I was looking for a palette that would encompass color options that I could play with. I am no professional, just love playing with make-up. I have had this palette for some times but I just recently started using it. The color come in dime size option, the package arrive without any problems and none were broken. When it comes to pigmentation, it is not all that. You will definitively need to use a primer. I have mostly used the earth tone colors and on my dark skin it did an okay job but I guess you get what you pay for. I say: if  you are on a budget and that you are looking for  a starter kit to play with then get it. If you are experienced in make-up and you looking for something more professional quality...keep shopping.</li>
    <li> I love my Fash pallette.  The shadows are very silkly to the touch and very pigmented.  I have other brand pallettes, but when it&#x27;s time to apply makeup, Fash is always the one I select.  Great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> I like the matte colors that are in the set.  What I did not like is that one shadow color was broken when it arrived, and some of the colors seem to be to shimmery and not rich.  Overall there are some very good colors that are in it.  I use about 13 out of the 88 but I really like the ones I do use so its worth it, and for the price you just can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I wonder if the payment of the product I ordered was accepted  NEW 2011 FASH Eyeshadow, 88 Warm Matte and Shimmer Palette  And when I get  Thank you.</li>
    <li> The eyeshadow is great but the box came with eyeshadow powder all over it and an eyeshadow was broken. Also the hinge of the eyeshadow box broke easily.</li>
    <li> this is perfect for a throw in the bag travel item, but it&#x27;s not a professional set. the colors were tiny and some were broken and unusable. if all the colors were usable, I would have given this a four star. I would have liked for the color trays to have been bigger.</li>
    <li> I love the different colors. When I received the package it was messy and one on the colors were broke.</li>
    <li> Great selection of eyeshadow colors but three were broken in transit.  There was eyeshadow covering the exterior of the box and all over the interior.  I&#x27;m not sure if there really is a way to prevent this from happening.  A sheet of plastic was covering the eyeshadows in the box as an extra measure of protection but it didn&#x27;t work.  On the bright side, it was inexpensive and I still have a lot of colors to play with.</li>
    <li> My sister had these sparkling and bold rich eye colors that I envied. She told me she was wearing FASH and showed me her amazing palette of beauty. I had to have it!</li>
    <li> The make up came in really quick. It&#x27;s a gift for my daughter and I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll love it with all the choices of colors available in the palette.  She will be very excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is always a pleasure to shop on and provides really quick service. For the product the value and price were terrific and simple!</li>
