      <li>My husband love it..</li>

      <li>Much better price then going to the store.</li>

      <li>Product seems to be fine.  </li>
      <li>So I ditched my go to cologne Acqua di Gio, with many success stories under it&#x27;s belt in my bachelor days</li>
      <li>Love the fragrance, been wearing for 5 years, I get so many complements, but does this dealer sell the real stuff?</li>
      <li>Its original and new product iam very satisfied.</li>
      <li>The longevity of this cologne is great and the price is great as well, you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
      <li>&quot; smell about him and that by the end of the play, she caught herself practically leaning completely on this \\&quot;amazing smelling guy.\\</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been through a couple of bottles already &amp; can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
      <li>The product shipped quick</li>
      <li>I wear this cologne daily and it never fails to make my wife snuggle up to me and tell me how good I smell.  </li>
      <li>Very quick and packed very well.</li>
      <li>Ok... she was pregnant at the time, maybe it was her hormonal imbalance or something to that effect, this stuff doesn&#x27;t smell like an old man to me.&lt;br /&gt;Test</li>
      <li>So take it for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>So take it for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Everyone has their preferences but if you are looking for a great smelling soft cologne that will not overwhelm everyone in the room than look no further.</li>
      <li>, I was going to buy this magical potion that makes even married women pretty much ditch their husbands right in front of them.</li>
      <li>I figured for half the price if it smells good its worth it, to my surprise its the original one and smells exactly like the one I buy at Macys.</li>
      <li>the review should end here, right?</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a pretty cool little bottle that fits nice on my bathroom counter... collecting dust.</li>

      <li>The first thing I received in the order of 4 items.</li>
      <li>A generous amount for such a cheap price!</li>
      <li>first target...</li>
      <li>Not too rich but masculine.</li>
      <li>I keep several colognes on hand and Brit is great, It also is one of the few quality colognes that go on sale from time to time so you can get it for $30 instead of $65 from time to time</li>
      <li>and I know this is the real stuff...</li>
      <li>/&gt;shipping was fast</li>
      <li>Then I smelled both of them for the real test.</li>
      <li>But the stuff I got is the real stuff.</li>
      <li>The seller was very prompt with the shipping and the product was reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>I ordered this perfume for my Husband and he really like it...</li>
      <li>I received the package in the mail and it is the real stuff.</li>
      <li>I hesitated to buy this fragrance discounted online as I was afraid that I would receive a product that was not up to standards, but it arrived perfectly and in a timely manner.  </li>
      <li>This is a very crowded market.</li>
      <li>It is not one of those rustic masculine manly cologne&#x27;s, it is rather soft and clean and light.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love the product and it arrived before expected delivery date!</li>
      <li>I recieved my product very quickly, much more then expected and it was new and unused as advertised.  </li>
      <li>it really that strong?\\&quot; Half giggling, she answered, \\&quot;It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s strong so much as it&#x27;s kinda soapy</li>
      <li>it really that strong?\\&quot; Half giggling, she answered, \\&quot;It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s strong so much as it&#x27;s kinda soapy</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten any compliments on it yet, but this is likely my favorite daily cologne.</li>
      <li>Although I&#x27;ve never smelled the original from a department store or anything, the packaging seemed of high quality, the bottle seemed of high quality and the smell lasts quite a long time.</li>
      <li>I spent a long time looking for a scent that I could call my own, and after testing many different colognes I finally settled on this one.</li>
      <li>It was shipped from a vendor called New York Perfumes...</li>
      <li>Not an hour into the shift, the only good looking nurse there approached me and said that one of the patients had just complained about my cologne and that I should try and wash some of it off.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t wait to have her extra fluffy and roused (to put it kindly).</li>
      <li>Not an hour into the shift, the only good looking nurse there approached me and said that one of the patients had just complained about my cologne and that I should try and wash some of it off.</li>
      <li>I never once heard any compliments or inquiry as to what I was wearing either (which I get pretty regularly even still with the Acqua di Gio).</li>

      <li>Where have you been today, playing Bingo at an old folks home?\\&quot; ....</li>
      <li>but until I can get to a Burberry outlet (where the fragrance is always on sale), I would suggest you get it directly from a Burberry store/outlet/department store.</li>
      <li>is smell will last for whole day.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product, because it is the only one my son wants to wear and I do not blame him.</li>
      <li>smell rich not cheap.  </li>
      <li>I compared the new bottle with my old bottle and they are the same right down to the writing on the bottom of the bottle.</li>
      <li>&quot; Then she went on to gab about the rest of the night and got all fluffy and excited again when she got to the part about how her and her husband ran into that same guy from the play at a nearby bar.</li>
      <li>If she gives you anything but excited approval when you test it... put a big PASS on it and keep looking bub, your probably headed down the same road as me if you don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t definitively say that it is a fake, my nose is not that spectacular.</li>
      <li>If she gives you anything but excited approval when you test it... put a big PASS on it and keep looking bub, your probably headed down the same road as me if you don&#x27;t.l where I was doing a clinical rotation in the ER for school, hoping I would get a few reassuring compliments from some of the younger (or older) nurses working there...</li>

    <li> I wear this cologne daily and it never fails to make my wife snuggle up to me and tell me how good I smell.  I&#x27;ve been through a couple of bottles already &amp; can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  I&#x27;m also in and out of businesses all day dealing with the public &amp; it seems some woman is always asking me what I&#x27;m wearing.  When I tell my wife she just smiles and says they have good taste.</li>
    <li> I like this cologne a lot..... but I just don&#x27;t wear it that often. It smell nice but I just like Hanae Mori HM better for casual wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t call it a romantic, or a casual scent. But I guess it can be for both. I might put this on for when working.</li>
    <li> This is very good EDT for men. Many women like this cologne, so for the price which I found on Amazon is an excellent deal.</li>
    <li> I hesitated to buy this fragrance discounted online as I was afraid that I would receive a product that was not up to standards, but it arrived perfectly and in a timely manner.  100% satisfied!</li>
    <li> I LOOKED FORWARD TO THE BURBERRY BRIT COLOGNE.BUT I WAS BITTERLY DISSATIFIED WITH THE COLOGNE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THERE WAS HARDLY ANY SMELL AND GONE IN 2 MINUTES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I CALLED THE AGENTS AND WAS TOLD TO SEND THE COLOGNE BACK.GOT A REFUND SO NO DAMAGED DONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;G</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a must buy!!! Once you spray it on you can&#x27;t help but keep&lt;br /&gt;on smelling it!!!! Seriously!!  It&#x27;s very soft and Sexy!!!</li>
    <li> The first thing I received in the order of 4 items. Very quick and packed very well.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance, been wearing for 5 years, I get so many complements, but does this dealer sell the real stuff? not so sure.  First impression was that it smelled a little different but I can&#x27;t definitively say that it is a fake, my nose is not that spectacular. I never really analyzed the box before, but definitely never noticed Arabic on the bottom like the one I got.  Could be import, I guess, but until I can get to a Burberry outlet (where the fragrance is always on sale), I would suggest you get it directly from a Burberry store/outlet/department store.</li>
    <li> ok this cologne is and well remain great&lt;br /&gt;the smell is not overwhelming unlike some&lt;br /&gt;it keeps you guessing and smelling&lt;br /&gt;the scent lasts a good 5hrs  maybe even more&lt;br /&gt;shipping was fast i was expecting it after xmas&lt;br /&gt;thank you i will diffidently purchase from this vendor in the future&lt;br /&gt;well also recommend to friends&amp;family&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Burberry Brit for men is a good cologne, that doesn&#x27;t smell too strong.  The Amazon Fragrance page sells it at half the price as department stores, and it&#x27;s the same item.  It ships quickly and without breakage, and the aroma gets good compliments often.</li>
    <li> I recieved my product very quickly, much more then expected and it was new and unused as advertised.  Great sent but i have been using it for a couple of years now.  Much better price then going to the store.</li>
    <li> I have a few cologne&#x27;s around, some I like and some not so much. I smelled this at a TJ Maxx and immediately liked it. It is not overpowering and it doesn&#x27;t even last that long. But the scent is incredible. It is not one of those rustic masculine manly cologne&#x27;s, it is rather soft and clean and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has their preferences but if you are looking for a great smelling soft cologne that will not overwhelm everyone in the room than look no further.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne on shear whim having heard a long, exaggerated story from a female coworker. Basically, without out all the girly &#x27;woo&#x27; about it, my coworker said she was out with her husband to a holiday play and the man sitting next to her had the \\&quot;most attractive\\&quot; smell about him and that by the end of the play, she caught herself practically leaning completely on this \\&quot;amazing smelling guy.\\&quot; Then she went on to gab about the rest of the night and got all fluffy and excited again when she got to the part about how her and her husband ran into that same guy from the play at a nearby bar. With the courage of alcohol (I guess), she flirt-terogated him to find out what cologne he was wearing... none other than, you guessed it, Burberry Brit.&lt;br /&gt;Now... the review should end here, right? Sounds amazing, just seeing this girl get all worked up about it...WRONG...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought into her story all the same and had made up my mind, I was going to buy this magical potion that makes even married women pretty much ditch their husbands right in front of them. No true reason to have something with this potential power, being married myself, I just enjoyed the concept of it I guess. So I ditched my go to cologne Acqua di Gio, with many success stories under it&#x27;s belt in my bachelor days (even dated a girl once that called it \\&quot;sure f***\\&quot; ...classy lady), I suited up and sprayed down my new attention getter...&lt;br /&gt;My first target...the wife of course... I couldn&#x27;t wait to have her extra fluffy and roused (to put it kindly). Within seconds of walking in our home, my wife starts sniffing the air like a birddog and looks at me with a bitter beer face and says to me, \\&quot;Bluck! Where have you been today, playing Bingo at an old folks home?\\&quot; .... Ok... she was pregnant at the time, maybe it was her hormonal imbalance or something to that effect, this stuff doesn&#x27;t smell like an old man to me.&lt;br /&gt;Test target two... sprayed the tiniest bit on me and headed to the Hospital where I was doing a clinical rotation in the ER for school, hoping I would get a few reassuring compliments from some of the younger (or older) nurses working there... wrong again. Not an hour into the shift, the only good looking nurse there approached me and said that one of the patients had just complained about my cologne and that I should try and wash some of it off. The culprit, a 79 y/o lady that has COPD from smoking, of all things. A little confused I asked the nurse, \\&quot;Is it really that strong?\\&quot; Half giggling, she answered, \\&quot;It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s strong so much as it&#x27;s kinda soapy and, well, odd I guess...\\&quot; (guess she was trying to tell me off easy). Then later that night she was laughing about the irony of the whole thing, pointing out that people usually complain about the smell of a Hospital, not the cologne that staff members wear in a Hospital...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To cut this long story short, I can&#x27;t wear this cologne even if I wanted to. My wife, even post-pardum, hates it and though I never heard anymore negatively voiced opinions like those two I shared again, I never once heard any compliments or inquiry as to what I was wearing either (which I get pretty regularly even still with the Acqua di Gio). The only reason I gave it two stars rather than one is that I kind of enjoyed the comedy it yielded and also, all things aside it&#x27;s a pretty cool little bottle that fits nice on my bathroom counter... collecting dust. So take it for what it&#x27;s worth. My only advice is have your lady friend with you if you decide to test it out at the store. If she gives you anything but excited approval when you test it... put a big PASS on it and keep looking bub, your probably headed down the same road as me if you don&#x27;t.l where I was doing a clinical rotation in the ER for school, hoping I would get a few reassuring compliments from some of the younger (or older) nurses working there... wrong again.

The only reason I gave it two stars rather than one is that I kind of enjoyed the comedy it yielded and also, all things aside it&#x27;s a pretty cool little bottle that fits nice on my bathroom counter... collecting dust. So take it for what it&#x27;s worth. My only advice is have your lady friend with you if you decide to test it out at the store. If she gives you anything but excited approval when you test it... put a big PASS on it and keep looking bub, your probably headed down the same road as me if you don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell quite like I thought it would, but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s this seller&#x27;s fault.  Their service was impeccable!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! I bought this for my boyfriend it smells great! He loves it too! And he&#x27;s a cologne nut (so that says something)! The product shipped quick, I has it in my hands After only a few days! The bottle is huge! A generous amount for such a cheap price! Overall, very happy! B</li>
    <li> Product seems to be fine.  Delivery was late.  Amazon blamed the seller, and the seller blamed Amazon.  So I received what was supposed to be a birthday present after the birthday.  Be careful of this one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product, because it is the only one my son wants to wear and I do not blame him. This is the best smelling perfume for males that I have had the pleasure to smell. The seller was very prompt with the shipping and the product was reasonably priced. I will buy from this seller again. Seller to me has an A+++++ rating. I and my son are thrilled with this purchase from this seller.</li>
    <li> Great product Great price at Amazon and it make you smell good.&lt;br /&gt;Burberry Britt also last the entire day.  Enjoy! you can&#x27;t beat it.&lt;br /&gt;You smell rich not cheap.  Best price online \\&quot;Amazon\\&quot; Rocks!</li>
    <li> I spent a long time looking for a scent that I could call my own, and after testing many different colognes I finally settled on this one. I often get compliments on it when I am out and about from both men and women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This purchase was actually a gift for my father. He has worn royal copenhagen for years, but complimented me on my choice of cologne while I was home for the holidays. This served as a perfect father&#x27;s day gift.</li>
    <li> Great product and received at right time. I ordered this perfume for my Husband and he really like it...i really love the smell and the good thing about the burberry brit is smell will last for whole day. My husband love it..I suggest to buy this product. Its original and new product iam very satisfied.</li>
    <li> When I first ordered this product I had my concerns knowing its an expensive cologne, it runs up to $79.00 at Macys. I figured for half the price if it smells good its worth it, to my surprise its the original one and smells exactly like the one I buy at Macys. Great buy at a great price!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered Burberry Brit for men.. It was shipped from a vendor called New York Perfumes... I received the package in the mail and it is the real stuff. It is not imposter cologne. It came in a Burberry box and it is the same bottle that I bought from Macys. I compared the new bottle with my old bottle and they are the same right down to the writing on the bottom of the bottle. Word for word and both say made in France. Then I smelled both of them for the real test. I must say they are identical. I was worried because I read other reviews after I ordered it saying it was fake. I don&#x27;t know what vendor they bought from? But the stuff I got is the real stuff. Other people said they had Arabic writing on the bottle on the bottom. Well mine did not. I have been wearing this for about 7 years and I know this is the real stuff... Only difference is this bottle was $40 instead of $80 .</li>
    <li> Brit is a great cologne. I rank it up with Aqua di Gio(armani). Although Gio is my all-time favorite, Brit comes in at no.2. I keep several colognes on hand and Brit is great, It also is one of the few quality colognes that go on sale from time to time so you can get it for $30 instead of $65 from time to time</li>
    <li> Love the product and it arrived before expected delivery date!</li>
    <li> This is a very crowded market. This scent is good. I guess it depends on what you want your cologne to do for you. This one is a nice even scent. Not too rich but masculine.</li>
    <li> I noticed that other cologne reviews complain of Arabic writing on their colognes and that this denotes a fake product, however, my Burberry Brit from Amazon came with Arabic writing, and I don&#x27;t believe it is fake. Although I&#x27;ve never smelled the original from a department store or anything, the packaging seemed of high quality, the bottle seemed of high quality and the smell lasts quite a long time. The only odd thing about it is that I can&#x27;t smell it on any clothes I&#x27;m wearing shortly after I&#x27;ve sprayed, but if I put the jacket or shirt down for a night or so, I can smell it just fine when I pick it up the next day. The longevity of this cologne is great and the price is great as well, you really can&#x27;t go wrong. I haven&#x27;t gotten any compliments on it yet, but this is likely my favorite daily cologne.</li>
