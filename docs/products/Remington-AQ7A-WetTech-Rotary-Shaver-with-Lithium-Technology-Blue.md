<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> When I saw this was meant to be used with shaving gel, I thought hey, maybe this is finally the electric shaver that will make me give up blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should say: I shave not just my face but also my head.  I&#x27;ve gone through perhaps 5 electric shavers, many for Amazon Vine.  Some of them have almost been good enough; most of them have been good enough for my face at least.  This one is sort of at the bottom of the barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I didn&#x27;t use it in a shower, I can&#x27;t comment on that.  However, I used it out of the shower at the sink.  I used it with both shave gel and aloe vera gel.  In both cases, it became clogged up.  Not cool.  It did not give me a smooth, close shave on my face, which others have; I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair, so this is a pretty basic test.  On my head, it gave me a very poor shave indeed, much worse than other electric shavers I&#x27;ve tried.  Understandably, this is not meant for heads, just faces, but it&#x27;s a test I perform regardless.  Some have almost been able to hack it here.  This one didn&#x27;t come close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not an expert, just someone who&#x27;s tried a lot of shavers, does not want to spend a lot, and keeps going back to the blade.  I hope, someday, an electric shaver will shave both my face and head as quickly, or quicker than a blade; require less time, cost and cleanup; and give me a clean, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t the one, though, and does not compare favorably with others I&#x27;ve also used and discarded.</li>
    <li> The Remington AQ7A delivers a close shave, especially if you use the circular motion, it limits the amount of returns to spots.  Another positive is it is light weight.  The light weight may cause some to feel like it is cheaply made but I will reserve judgement until I have used the AQ7A more extensively.  An additional positive is the included shower mirror that works just as good as the one I paid ten dollars for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real negative at this time is it does not have a trimmer which means you will have to use something else for the finishing touches. For me that is a hassle because I have a goatee. It really is a bare minimum shaver.  I had a 3 day growth and it handled my tough beard with no problem, with only some minor snagging that was barely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The AQ7A is really more for those that shave everything off and don&#x27;t need any finishing touches and is recommended for those people.  For those that need something for finishing touches you will want to skip this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a great fan, but this razor does an adequate job after several minutes of repeated passes. I find it most useful for shaving in the field when I don&#x27;t have a mirror or water, brush and that sort of thing. Typically used for travel and military outings. It shouldn&#x27;t take so long to get rid of a dry beard. I think it might do a better job on coarse hair. My fine hair tends not to get cut off completely. I have to do many passes to clean the scruff.</li>
    <li> My husband is a horrible writer so I&#x27;m writing this for him.  Overall, he likes the razor. He said it does cut, but not as close as he would like.  We *think* this might be caused by the gray hair starting to populate his beard.  Gray hair has a texture all to itself and I&#x27;m not aware of any razor that has a design to accommodate all gray hair. (Idea? Not necessary?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does hold a good charge.  He has not tried it when wet: that&#x27;s not something that really interests him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He said for the price, and based upon his other experience with razors, it&#x27;s worth buying.</li>
    <li> Grand daughter loves it; with gel or just for a &#x27;light day&#x27; dry shave of the legs.</li>
    <li> It just doesn&#x27;t work as well as my cheaper one did. Very disappointed. I spent a lot of money expecting it to work much better.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected from Remington had this brand before they were good razors this one gives a very poor cut from day one its price was cheap so is it&#x27;s quality I figured the lower price was due to it not having trimmer not so got less than I paid for and that wasn&#x27;t much.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as good as it should for the price.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money. I bought this razor ,it was delivered yesterday. I plugged it in ,nothing. The Charger was broken. It would not even start to charge. I figured if the charger is broken the razor cant be far behind. I packed it up, got a return order and sent it back Had enough.</li>
    <li> Love it! Not quite as close as a blade razor but it does the job.</li>
    <li> Got this for my elderly father a few months before he died. Gave a close shave and cleaned easily. We prefer to &#x27;buy local&#x27; whenever we can but, with that method we&#x27;d tried a similar model, made by Norelco, but didn&#x27;t find it gave a quality shave and took it back. This Remington is now in the hands of my nephew and has much life left for his use.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so exited when I bought this razor. Use it in the shower, charging base, remington, all great. I have only used Remington shavers, and although they have declined in quality I thought I would give this a try. Let me make it very clear how much they have disappointed me, I stopped going to work to write this review because my shaver stopped working the 8th time I have used it. No overcharging, not sitting in heat. This razor has been babied and it has broken when I needed it the most. Battery is not strong enough to hold a charge, and I cant plug it into a wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE LAST REMINGTON SHAVER I WILL EVER BUY - GARBAGE BRAND THAT WILL GO OUT OF BUSINESS TO NORELCO</li>
    <li> Shaves bald head smooth without the nicks from blade shaving. Charge holds for a crazy number of shaves.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my 80 y/o dad who had not used an electric razor in 40 yrs. I knew he would love the wet shaver, &amp; HE DID. (and he will tell you&lt;br /&gt;straight up his opinion.)</li>
    <li> Very Pleased with the product and the service</li>
    <li> Very nice shaver, can sustain battery for almost a week without charge, makes too much noise when you shave, it looks like Remington reduced the quality and accessories of the product but did not reduced the price</li>
    <li> I have been a longtime Norelco user, and I was curious to see how this Remingston electric razor worked by comparison. I was very pleased overall. I use my razor everyday, and while I prefer a dry shave, I was pleased to see that I could enjoy an occasional wet shave if I desired with the Remington AQ78.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had this Remington long enough to judge its battery life.  A full charge on my previous Norelco gave me about seven or eight shaves, i.e. one full week, before I needed to charge the unit for six to eight hours.  I have used this Remington for almost a full week, and the battery life appears to be quite good.  It&#x27;s possible I may get nine or ten shaves before it needs re-charging.  As far as its noise level, it&#x27;s comparable with my Norelco.  Overall, though, I prefer the rubberized feel of this devide.  It&#x27;s smooth and provides an easy grip. There&#x27;s no real chance that this will ever slip out of my hand.  I do like the simple black and white color scheme of my Norelco, but that&#x27;s a very minor point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all that aside, how does it work?  It works, in my opinion, just as well as any other electric razor I have owned.  That is, it&#x27;s good but takes some effort.  A decent shave takes me seven to ten minutes, and as with my various Norelco razors, I often have to go over the same area several times to get the job done.  Thus, this Remington AQ78 is just as good, but no better, than the other razors I have used over the years.  It is recommended if you need a decent, inexpensive razor, though I could easily say the same for Norelco.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, rotary shavers are generally better than other type of shavers. And this Remington model fulfilled its purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a clean shave, and comes with its own charging stand and travel mirror. It charges up quickly. Also, you can use it with water, in a shower, etc. However, unlike in other rotary shavers, there&#x27;s no pop up trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another con, when you want to clean out the head, it doesn&#x27;t really open up automatically like in other shavers, but you have to press a slow-moving button and practically have to open it up manually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, I thought it was very nicely packaged (almost like I was buying a gift set) and has an attractive design. With the inclusion of a trimmer and a cheaper price, it would have been almost perfect.</li>
    <li> Remington states that the AQ7A Wet-tech rotary shaver has dual-track heads and 33% more head flexing for an \\&quot;ultra close shave.\\&quot; The lithium battery is supposed to give an hour of shaving between recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the Remington AQ7A gives a pretty fast shave, but not the \\&quot;ultra close shave\\&quot; advertised.  I&#x27;ve been using a Panasonic shaver ([[ASIN:B005DKKBRY Panasonic ES-LT41-K Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Black/Silver]]) and I don&#x27;t think the shave is as close as the Panasonic.  The RPM of the Panasonic is much faster, but he Remington still gives a good shave. Either the Panasonic or this Remington can be used as a wet shaver.  But I didn&#x27;t think the wet shave with the Remington was any closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparison to the Panasonic there are a few things that I didn&#x27;t like about the Remington.  The Remington does not have a pop-up trimmer for trimming sideburns, mustaches, etc.  Some might find that to be a deal breaker.  The Remington does not have an indicator of how much charge is left on the battery like the Panasonic.  And the charging base of the Remington is about twice the size of the Panasonic charging cord. So if space is an issue when traveling, that might be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the Remington was good, but my personal preference is the Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I am not a big fan of electric shavers because I rarely find one that does what it says. This product was no exception as I did not get a close shave even after multiple attempts. However, I will say that it was no worse than other shavers I have used. It works in the shower, which is a plus for those of us on the go. It does not have a trimmer, which may or may not be a deal breaker for you. For the price, it&#x27;s not bad, and if you like electric shavers, I think this model will work fine for you. If you are looking for a close shave similar to a quality razor blade, this is not what you need.</li>
    <li> I had my husband try out this shaver and compare to the Norelco I bought him for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;What he liked:  Close shave, ergonomic grip, good battery life, looks cool&lt;br /&gt;What he didn&#x27;t like:  no pop up trimmer, pulls when used dry, charging stand instead of power cord&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has no particular interest in shaving in the shower so that feature isn&#x27;t something he&#x27;s used.  Some have mentioned that helps minimize discomfort when shaving but he is \\&quot;old skool\\&quot; and can&#x27;t be convinced to take an electric appliance into the shower!  Also, the charging stand kinda bugs me.  It would lead you to believe the razor should be stored in the stand in between uses, plugged in and draining power.  Can&#x27;t imagine why you&#x27;d need this with a lithium powered device that&#x27;s going to hold a charge for a week or two.  I&#x27;d rather have a regular power cord we could stash in a drawer most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington shaver is currently selling for $20 more than the Norelco PT730 which comes with a pop up trimmer.  Unless shaving in the shower is of the utmost importance to you, I&#x27;d go with the Norelco.</li>
    <li> Like many men, I have a love/hate relationship with electric razors. Love the convenience, but hate the irritation and sometimes long shaving times. I&#x27;ve been using a [[ASIN:B006GQYSGO Philips Norelco PT730 Powertouch Electric Razor]] for the past year, along with my trusty 5-blade [[ASIN:B000BUUVTE Gillette Fusion Manual Razor]] in-between, when I want a really close shave. The Norelco blades are starting to get a bit dull, and I&#x27;ve always wanted to try an electric wet shaver, so I picked up this Remington AQ7A Wettech Rotary Shaver with Lithium Technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I charged the unit initially for 24 hours, per the instructions. I like that it has a quick 90 min. full charge time after that - I always seem to forget to charge my stuff. It also has a quick 5 min charge cycle good for one or two shaves (I have a feeling I&#x27;ll be using this feature frequently...lol.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to skip the dry shave and just hop in the shower with some Edge Gel and try this guy out! Felt very weird at first using an electric razor with gel, but after a minute I realized I should have done this A LONG TIME AGO. What a difference in the closeness of the shave and the lack of irritation over my dry Norelco electric! The trick is not to use too much shave gel or the blades can&#x27;t reach your face very well - just a thin layer of gel/foam is best. I used the travel mirror that was included with the razor and it worked just OK. (I&#x27;ll definitely be getting a real fog-proof shower mirror shortly.) When I got out of the shower after that first use I realized I missed a couple of spots on my face. I&#x27;ve since gotten better at getting my whole face now. I still don&#x27;t get the the kind of truly close shave I get with my Gillette Fusion Manual Razor, but it&#x27;s still a pretty decent shave, and I don&#x27;t have to deal with the bloody toilet paper blobs stuck to my face afterward. You men know what I mean here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rubber surfaces of the razor are nicely grippy even when wet and soapy, and I didn&#x27;t have any trouble holding onto it at different angles. The rotary blades are very flexible and followed the contours of my face fairly well. As usual, I couldn&#x27;t get my upper lip near my nose all that well - but that&#x27;s a common drawback of most electrics. Also, I sometimes wear a goatee and rotary electrics are pretty bad at cutting in close to a beard - this model is no better than the rest at this. I know to use a separate electric trimmer around my beard beforehand - ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS MODEL DOESN&#x27;T EVEN HAVE A BUILT-IN TRIMMER - minus 1 star for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve shaved with it four times so far and the battery is still going strong - so I think it has good longevity. I&#x27;ll always keep my manual razor handy, but I think maybe this is one of the best shaves I&#x27;ve gotten from an electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDED!and I didn&#x27;t have any trouble holding onto it at different angles.

    <li> I have been using this electric razor for a few weeks, and there are a few things about it that mildly annoy me.&lt;br /&gt;The shave itself is good, and I like that it can be used in the shower.  This makes for easy cleaning afterwards as the head opens on a hinge (so you won&#x27;t loose it in the shower).&lt;br /&gt;A few things bother me.  The design of the head is such a way that I have trouble shaving around my upper lip - as the razors have a distance from the end of the metal guard.  This causes me to have to really press hard against my nose to properly shave my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;No trimmer makes it so you cannot trim your sideburns.  Not sure why this was left out - perhaps to make sure it is waterproof?</li>
    <li> This is a typical electric rotary shaver.  The battery seems to last longer than my previous shaver and it is lighter.  As others have noted, this shaver doesn&#x27;t have a built-in sideburn trimmer but I&#x27;m using a mustache trimmer for that purpose so it isn&#x27;t a big problem for me.  I&#x27;ve not tried it in the shower but the case looks like it could rise to the challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice feature is that this shaver is easier to clean than any other shaver I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> The Remington AQ7A Wettech Rotary Shaver has worked reasonably well for me as an inexpensive electric shaver. I like the simple design and the small charging base that doesn&#x27;t take up much space. The battery is good enough that the shaver can be taken on short trips (less than 1 week) without recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are a few points about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- like most electric razors, give your face a week or so to adjust to the blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- don&#x27;t press too hard to avoid injuries&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- in my experience, even though this shaver can work dry or wet, a dry shave is smoother and better overall&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- if used daily, no electric shaver should be expected to last for more than 1 or 2 years at most (and it&#x27;s almost always cheaper to purchase a new shaver than to replace the blades)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad that bathroom shavers are finally utilizing lithium technology. With up to three times the battery life, you will no longer have to worry about the battery running out after a mere 20 minutes of shaving time. You now have a full lithium-driven sixty minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seriously, this is a good razor for its price range. Many of the other reviewers have mentioned that there is no trimmer, but that is pretty standard for an electric razor in this price range. The charge lasts well, it&#x27;s simple to clean and it works well. It&#x27;s not a super close shave, but it&#x27;s an easy, quick shave. If you have had issues with electric razors in the past, this one will not be the magical one that doesn&#x27;t cause you problems.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for the right electric shaver and its been years...I will still continue looking.&lt;br /&gt;First off, I am a big fan of razors, it is the closest shave you will have from a straight razor to a handle whether its a single, double or quadruple blade.&lt;br /&gt;This electric shaver does a nice job, in dry and in wet conditions. The shave is close but if you run your hand agains the grain of your beard you feel the small stubble.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t really tell by looking at it after shaving but I will show a stubble around 2 pm, (disclosure: I can grow a thick full beard fairly easy).&lt;br /&gt;The shave under wet conditions (shower) definitely leaves less irritation in your skin which is nice as with most shavers I have used I have a lasting irritation on my skin after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver will last at least 4 full rounds and does a good job. However, I am not ready to accept anything less than a close, clean, non-irritating (Sharp blade) shave yet.</li>
    <li> Husband likes it; easy to clean.</li>
    <li> It works well.Shaver is light and base with rubber bottom is heavy enough to stay on counter as you remove it.</li>
    <li> The Remington AQ7A razor currently replaces an older-model Remington rotary-style electric shaver. In the package is the razor itself, a charging cradle/cord, a small cleaning brush and a plastic \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot; mirror for use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using electric razors of various styles for many years now and my impressions of the Remington AQ7A are generally favorable. This razor replaces an older model Remington rotary-style shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it is generally understood that an electric razor will not provide as close of a shave as a standard razor will, I found the AQ7A to perform as well (or a bit better actually with the benefit of having fresh cutting blades/foils) as other electric razors that I have used over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular model is built to be waterproof, and functions as advertised, allowing the razor to be used in the shower if wanted. I generally do not shave in the shower but that option is handy and it seems to perform about as well there as it does during dry usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Rubberized Grip: Blue rubberized grip actually works well in terms of gripping the shaver both in and out of the shower. I actually like the color, but of course opinions will vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solid Feel: As part of waterproofing the razor, some of the moving parts seem to have been eliminated, which makes the razor seem more solid and less likely to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Improved battery: I&#x27;ve used the razor 7-8 times and still haven&#x27;t seen the charge indicator light up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;No sideburns/beard trimmer: I don&#x27;t use it often but I do miss this feature. I&#x27;m sure Remington has plenty of other options for purchase though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging stand: I really don&#x27;t like having the bulky charging stand as part of the device. I&#x27;m sure some will like having the base but I don&#x27;t like having this accessory, especially if I&#x27;m on a long enough trip where I will need the charger. It would be nice to have the option of charging without the base by just plugging the cable directly into the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery Gauge: While the improved battery life make a difference, the gauge only indicates when the battery is low, versus providing any sort of level/amount of battery remaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In most ways I think this device is an improvement on the previous model Remington shaver owned. The very basic feature set with improved battery and waterproof housing make it a very basic but useful device to have around in the mornings!harging without the base by just plugging the cable directly into the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery Gauge: While the improved battery life make a difference, the gauge only indicates when the battery is low, versus providing any sort of level/amount of battery remaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In most ways I think this device is an improvement on the previous model Remington shaver owned.

    <li> I&#x27;m coming to this after having used a Braun 7505 electric shaver for 8 years, and a Norelco for 10 years before that. I have never changed the blades on my Braun in the last 7 years, and it *still* does a way better job than this one. A closer shave, in less time, with less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here are my gripes about this Remington:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels cheap. My previous two felt solid and sturdy. This one feels like plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t use it corded, only cordless. I suppose this is a safety feature. You can use this shaver in the shower, and I guess someone might be stupid enough to try to do that while it was plugged in to a wall outlet if it were possible. But it&#x27;s not possible. Which means that when the battery in this thing stops holding a charge (for rechargeable lithium batteries, that usually takes about 3 years after the manufacture of the battery), it&#x27;s a piece of garbage, as there&#x27;s no convenient way to replace the internal battery. Now, my old Braun doesn&#x27;t hold a charge real well either at this point. But I can still use it, because I can run it corded. This one doesn&#x27;t have that option. Also, the base is required for charging. It&#x27;s not huge, but it&#x27;s more bulky than just a cord. More to pack on extended trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shaving with this Remington, I can still feel quite a bit of stubble. A quick run over it with my old Braun 7505 (which, again, is using a 8-year-old, never-replaced cutter), and it&#x27;s gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No trimmer. Both my Norelco and Braun have trimmers. For me, it&#x27;s essential. I&#x27;ll often go a week or more at a time without shaving, and use the trimmer to shorten everything so the razor can deal with it effectively. That&#x27;s worked well for me. Without one, this razor tears at the hairs. It hurts. I don&#x27;t like that. Trimming sideburns or beards is also pretty much impossible without one. Why Remington would have released a product without one is beyond me, as all other brands seem to include one with their equivalent models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d much rather have a straight-style foil electric razor like the [[ASIN:B001DNE3KQ Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver]], which is supposedly pretty awesome, shower-tolerant, and includes a trimmer. I find foil shavers faster to use, and more effective. If I wanted a three-circle rotary type, I&#x27;d stick with a Norelco like the [[ASIN:B006GQYSC8 Philips Norelco AT810 Powertouch with Aquatec Electric Razor]]. It&#x27;d do a better job than this one, and be built better. Either option (the Panasonic or that Norelco) is comparably priced to this one, works wet or dry, includes a trimmer, and would just be a much better choice overall.ent models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d much rather have a straight-style foil electric razor like the [[ASIN:B001DNE3KQ Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver]], which is supposedly pretty awesome, shower-tolerant, and includes a trimmer.

    <li> It is a kosher ready shaver and very good shaver too ! It is difficult find one like this , great</li>
    <li> This is one great shaver.  I use it in the shower all the time to shave my bald head.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a good product easy to use close shave .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for 4 months and have been very satisfied.  20 second shave every day.  Real close.  The only thing i miss is it doesn&#x27;t have the trimmer feature.  The Charge last 1-2 months.  I only recharged it twice and not because it needed it, only because i didn&#x27;t charge in a while.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my son &amp; he is very happy with the performance of this shaver. He likes the fact that he may use it in the shower, also.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace my battery operated shaver.  I know it&#x27;s for men, but works great for the 3 ladies in this household.  Actually better than my old one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using &#x27;triple head&#x27; razors for almost 40 years.  The first few lasted for several years each, these later ones not so much.  It seems they are getting worse and not better.  My previous razor was a Norelco 8240 XL and I&#x27;ll be comparing the Remington AQ7 to it.  I&#x27;ve been using the Remington for a few weeks.  According to the user manual I should use it for at least a month before passing judgment, but the Vine program isn&#x27;t giving me that long.  When I&#x27;m shaving I use Afta or CVS pre-shave, which I highly recommend.  The shave with the Remington is not as good as I was getting the Norelco.  I leave the Remington in the charging stand when I&#x27;m not using it so I don&#x27;t have a feel for how long it will hold a charge.  I did initially try it in the shower but I really did not like that.  I got a horrible shave (I didn&#x27;t use any gel so that may have helped) and the whole idea of standing in the shower while I shave makes no sense to me.  The Remington also seemed louder than the Norelco so I measured it with a multi-meter I have and sure enough the Norelco was 2.5 dB at 6 inches and the Remington was 5.5 dB at the same distance.  Finally, I use the clipper on my razors all of the time.  When I found out the Remington does not have a clipper I was really disappointed.  Final verdict: if you really, really need to shave in the shower this razor might be for you, otherwise I suggest looking elsewhere.</li>
    <li> It gives a nice shave, but I would not trade my [[ASIN:B001AJ6YS2 Norelco 7310]] for this Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington advantages:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads seem to spin faster than on my Norelco 7310.

The shaver is a little larger, and the charging stand adds more bulk.&lt;br /&gt; - Expensive (price averages $69 vs $39 for Norelco 7310)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither shaver has a fuel gauge (lights showing battery level)&lt;br /&gt;Neither shaver comes with a travel case&lt;br /&gt;Neither shaver has a switch lock to prevent suitcase-on&lt;br /&gt;Both companies ask you to spend $25-30 per year on replacement heads.

    <li> It didn&#x27;t have a sideburn trimmer &amp; I just figured they all did</li>
    <li> This is a decent rotary shaver. While not as close as a foil shaver, rotaries give better coverage. I use it as a dry shaver, not wet. How much hot water can you afford to let go down the drain?</li>
    <li> I really like the new Remington shaver.  Although it has the same style rotary head as My Norelco, for some reason it seems to shave cleaner.  I have yet to try using it in the shower.  For some reason (my age) it just doesn&#x27;t seem like a sane thing to do.  I still prefer my edge Gel and a normal disposable raiser blade.  Nothing is as clean as that process; however, for a quick shave while driving to a date or a meeting, this Remington really fills the bill.</li>
    <li> The new Remington AQ7A shaver has some major improvements over the older [[ASIN:B001BJHCVO R-5130 model]] which I rated only \\&quot;okay\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It certainly functions well enough as a razor, producing a close shave and leaving the skin smooth and unabraded. Shaving with a rotary razor requires a different technique than with other types&amp;mdash;go over the same area several times in little circles and pull the skin taut if there are tight curves or wrinkles.  Only minimal pressure is required and there is no pulling or pain. The blades don&#x27;t touch the skin so they don&#x27;t scrape it and the likelihood of ingrown hairs is reduced.  Being able to use this shaver in the shower with shaving gel is a major advantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The redesigned handle is significantly less bulky and fits very comfortably in the hand.  The cobalt-blue soft touch plastic has a nice feel and combined with the well-placed ridges, gives a good grip when used in the shower.  The scalloped base hints that this version can be used in the shower and rinsed for cleaning although it shouldn&#x27;t be submerged in water.  The overall appearance is attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The button that opens the blade compartment has been redesigned so that it is less likely to be pressed accidentally.  The blades and the blade mechanism are the same and although they require some care in cleaning and are expensive to replace, they last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery charges quickly and the motor isn&#x27;t noisy.  It comes with a recharging stand with a non-slip base which is handy because the shaver just slips right in and stays charged rather than requiring that the plug be manually inserted in the base for recharging.  There is a blue LED to show the battery is charging and a red LED to show when the charge is low.  The battery on the older model lasted a little over two years using it two or three times a week but it was a nickel-metal hydride type and this new model has a lithium-ion battery which I am hoping will last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good choice in a rotary shaver with a very functional and attractive design and it gives good results used wet or dry.nger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good choice in a rotary shaver with a very functional and attractive design and it gives good results used wet or dry.</li>
    <li> This shaver doesn&#x27;t come with a trimmer. This was the first in a series of disappointments that I found with this product. I&#x27;m not an enormous fan of electric shavers and this one failed to make me a believer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is good for the face, but not so good for the neck. I found that the razor was bad at getting close shavers for bits that it didn&#x27;t get the first time. It&#x27;s not the most comfortable shaver either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since replacements for this razor are expensive, I don&#x27;t think this razor is a very good electric shaver and certainly not worth your money.</li>
    <li> While I obviously haven&#x27;t tried every razor, this is the best one I&#x27;ve used. Some razors give me irritation, but this one has only given me minor irritation and I&#x27;m sure over time, with regular use, my skin will get used to it. I have only used it twice dry over the sink but may try using it in the shower soon to see how it holds up in there. Overall, I would recommend this razor because it is a wet/dry razor and reasonably priced. I&#x27;ve seen razors priced over $200, so for $70, you are getting a good razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several days now and it still has a charge.  I used to use the \\&quot;other\\&quot; triple headed razor (and it&#x27;s a good razor but) this has all that the \\&quot;other\\&quot; has and I like the fact that this is much lighter.  The grip feels good in the hand and, of course, it shaves close without having to go back and forth over and over.  I gave it five stars because I could think of no reason not too..</li>
    <li> This is a nice razor for both dry and wet shaving. It use it in front of the sink and in the shower, and it work well in both applications. The charge-to-use ratio, for lack of a better term, is also good. I usually charge it only once per week...but it has gone two weeks between charges and still ran just fine.I also like the stand...an item that other manufacturers have stopped including with their razors...probably to save costs...but that makes them less handy, in my opinion. Finally, this unit fits well in my had.</li>
    <li> Remington&#x27;s AQ7A Rotary Shaver is hard to criticize.  It offers a quality shaving product at a price much lower than the higher end shaving offerings, but has often demanded features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the expected wet functionality is here.  It can be used wet, but as most reviews suggest, you will find limited use for this functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, unique to a rotary shaver in this price range is an included docking station.  It seems simple, but it does help you keep it charged up, when you have an easy dock to drop it into.  Why fumble with hooking up the cable&#x27;s plug each time, when you can just drop it in the cradle?  I love that!  Furthermore, leave it in the cradle regularly should you with.  With the lithium technology, you do not have to worry about batteries being affected overtime as dramatically as shavers from a decade ago. Sure, the battery will not last forever but it will hold up longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, the shaving performance is as expected for this price range and even some shavers nearly twice as much.  Nevertheless, as other reviewers suggest, these products always leave some to be desired if you&#x27;re particularly fussy regarding your shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a quality product from Remington.  They have brought forward many premium features such as wet use technology, lithium battery technology to not see decreased battery performance over time, a charging cradle, and solid performance.  All of this can be had at an attractive value.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good wet/dry shaver for the shower to shave my legs. I quit using ladies&#x27; shavers some time ago, because they never seem to reach deep enough. I have been using the Gillette Mach 3 Turbo, which is a motorized (battery powered) blade that is a cross between a manual and power razor. I decided to give it a go and try this Remington wet/dry, and am so pleased with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first wet/dry shaver that I have felt comfortable with actually WET, as it feels nicely sealed, and the rubber grip is superior, giving it a secure feel in my hand. The shave is comfortable and doesn&#x27;t leave any red, raised or raw feel afterwards. I use gel when wet, as recommended, and it works fast and fluidly. I brought it to Europe for our month-long vacation and my husband and I shared it. His skin felt so soft and kissable afterwards. ☺&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great for travel, as we only needed to charge it every several days. It lasts about 60 minutes (reportedly) of actual shaving time, but I do like to charge it regularly. It&#x27;s a nice looking razor, and would also make a lovely gift for that special person in your life.</li>
    <li> I owned the Remington Wettech Rotary Shower razor for barely a week when it fell into the bathtub and one of the rotary heads busted off. Irreparably. Turns out the plastic clips for the rotor are very thin and cheaply made.  And it costs about $22 plus S&amp;H to replace the rotor head attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the thing broke, it was a good razor. It shaved nicely without yanking the hair and could be used wet or dry. It charges fast for hours of use. It even comes with a little shower mirror. There&#x27;s no sideburn attachment, so if that is neccessary, this is not the razor you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you need a tough razor that will survive a drop into the darn tub, this is not the razor for you.</li>
    <li> I chose this electric razor for my teenage son.  Before receiving this razor, he depillitated \\&quot;Old School\\&quot; (disposable razor and shaving cream, not straight razor and shaving soap.  Not THAT old school).  Yep, my previous offspring was an electric razor virgin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 17 year-old said these features are the razor&#x27;s PROs:&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s quiet, so he can shave before school without waking the house.&lt;br /&gt;- Rechargeable&lt;br /&gt;- Holds the charge for a long time&lt;br /&gt;- Waterproof&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;- Fits in his hand easily&lt;br /&gt;- Relatively inexpensive (This is Mom&#x27;s PRO.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He noted the following CONs:&lt;br /&gt;- No trimmer so he can&#x27;t keep his faux hawk neat.  (I explained that his face razor is not to be used to manage his \\&quot;do\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;- Gets clogged up if used by his younger sister to shave her legs (I explained to the girl that her brother&#x27;s electric razor is not to be used for her depillitation needs)&lt;br /&gt;- Although it says it works dry, it takes several passes to get &#x27;er done.</li>
    <li> works very gooid&lt;br /&gt;had to replace one but got a replacement the next day&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> Not what I expected, no power and cheap, Dad &amp;#34;hates it.&amp;#34; Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband to try out, and he likes it better than any other electric razor he&#x27;s used. Normally he doesn&#x27;t really notice much difference in any of the decent razors out there and their performance. They all work well and are relatively the same. However, this one did stand out. He said this one really does not pull or snag on some of those longer hairs. It&#x27;s nice and lightweight. It gives a smooth, clean shave, and he mentioned that it feels like it glides over the skin nicely. (He uses it dry, not in the shower, just to let you know this review is based on using it dry.) It also stayed charged all weekend. We have a small bathroom with just one outlet and our daughter had unplugged this razor to do her hair and never plugged it back it, so a long charge is always a perk for us. He would recommed this to anyone wanting a really nice electric razor.</li>
