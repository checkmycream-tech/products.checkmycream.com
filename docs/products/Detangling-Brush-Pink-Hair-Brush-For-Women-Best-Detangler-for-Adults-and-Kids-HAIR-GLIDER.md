<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have long fine hair and no longer use a spray-in detangler because this brush gets through wet hair easily without pulling.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Does good! No pulling of the hair!! I love it</li>
    <li> I have serious issues with my hair tangling. I cam across this brush and thought I would give it a try and WOW, was I ever surprised!! I have very thick hair and I have found with most brushes they either brake or just plain don&#x27;t work and don&#x27;t get through the tangles. This brush is easy to use, it&#x27;s the perfect size in my hand and actually gets through the tangles and it seems to mold to my head! ! I always put it in my purse now, since my hair tangles throughout the day. I can&#x27;t leave home with out it! Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Finally found the perfect brush for myself and my 3 year old daughter! We love the color and its sleek design. My 3 year old daughter doesn&#x27;t cringe or cry anymore when I brush her hair specially in the morning when she wakes up! With her long locks, she gets her hair tangled all the time. Fixing her hair is not a pain anymore and we are so delighted! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this brush... I have 4c hair and I use this for my wash n&#x27;go &amp; to define my twist outs. Definitely a must have for us natural girls</li>
    <li> I have 4 daughter.  All with long hair.  They all loved it.</li>
    <li> I got my brush today and it was just in a nick of time. My daughters hair has always been thick and hard to comb. Most times I have to wet it before I comb it. It&#x27;s rather cold out so I really didn&#x27;t want to wet it. Well this brush eliminates the need for me to wet her hair before combing it. It is gentle on the hair while still getting it untangled. Love this brush!</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It feels great on my head, easily takes away the tangles, and the color is fantastic! I have a hard time trying to find a good brush, for I have mixed hair. But this gets the kinks out, and smooths it well so I can get it into a ponytail! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This by far is the best Detangling brush I have purchased, and I have bought several for my daughter!  This is the first one that has actually worked and no tears were shed!  Mornings are much easier with this Ultimate Detangling Brush!</li>
    <li> There are a number of detangling brushes on the market, but none compare to this.  Why?  The ergonomically handle is EASY to hold if you&#x27;re brushing yourself, or you&#x27;re brushing someone else.  As a father of a girl with long hair, tangles are part of our daily lives.  This brush helps ease that struggle.  Get one - you&#x27;ll agree!</li>
    <li> Finally something that works, I use this on my daughter before school. This saves me time and stress. Grateful for the few moments of peace in the morning</li>
    <li> My daughter has been bugging me for this brush for a year, so when I had the chance to review it for a reduced price I jumped on the opportunity! Now I see why she wanted it! She has very long hair to her waist, and this brush works great at removing the tangles. It leaves her har looking smooth and soft, no flyaways or static. This a great little brush, and the pink color is so bright and girly!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I purchased this brush hoping that it would work out for my daughter. She has long fine hair that tangles easily. Despite what many reviews stated, this brush does pull and break hair. It also has rough plastic bristles that scratch your head when you brush. This brush was definitely a disappointment.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews, I thought this would be a great detangler, however the bristles are stiff and cause my daughter pain when brushing her hair.  I suspect she&#x27;ll like it more when she is older (she&#x27;s 4 now), but there are other, less stiff, brushes on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Works great, way less complaining from my 5 year old.</li>
    <li> It work great my daughter get really bad knots in her hair from sleeping tossing and turning, she use to cry when ever it was time to brush her hair! Not any more now!</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair, for a long time I had a mat of tangles at the base of my skull that used to take me up to an hour to detangle. My hair was getting unmanageable so I cut it off. After donating 4 pony tails to locks of love, as my hair reached all the way down to my knees when I was standing up, I thought my hair would be easy to care for. But if I&#x27;m not careful, I still get very bad tangles in my short hair. Now that I am starting to grow it out again, I thought my troubles would be back, but I received an opportunity to try this brush at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased, review. (all opinions are my own) I took my hair down from it&#x27;s ponytail and ran the brush through, figuring it would get caught fairly quickly. To my surprise, it didn&#x27;t really snag at all. It actually did as it claimed. My hair was smooth and the spot at the base of my skull that always gets missed no matter how hard I try, was also smooth and untangled. I am really shocked. I have tried so many brushes for myself and had sort of given up on finding something just for me. I will be keeping my brush in a safe place so my kids don&#x27;t lose it and recommending to all of my friends. I am very happy with this purchase and would buy it again. It is worth the money.</li>
    <li> Can a brush be elegant and posh? Well, this detangling brush, in pink has my vote. The dual height bristles glide through my granddaughter&#x27;s thick locks without so much as a tug. She has such a tender head...brushing was a chore. Not anymore! She loves the hot pink color, she super cool heart design on the back AND that it doesn&#x27;t hurt to brush her hair anymore. Kudos to the seller for this detangling brush, it&#x27;s a hit here at Grandma&#x27;s house!</li>
    <li> Brushing my daughters hair is a battle! So I decided we needed to try one of these. This brush is amazing. Do you know what was also amazing?! Brushing her hair without her whining. Doing her hair can sometimes be so stressful due to the knots that she can get. I am so glad that it will be easier now. Her hair was so smooth after using this brush. I would recommend it to anyone with little girls!</li>
    <li> Love this detangler brush, glides through your hair!!</li>
    <li> I was able to get this product for an awesome price to try it out &amp; review. This brush has made my life a little easier, no more tears shed while I brush my daughter&#x27;s hair. I like that it has different size bristles &amp; they are very flexible so they don&#x27;t yank on the hair as I go. I also use this brush on my fried hair &amp; I have noticed much less hair in the brush, really a good buy for kids &amp; adults.</li>
    <li> I received this brush , and I must say I was so impressed . The brush really does what is claims to do. I tried it and my hair does get very tangled , it did the job great without lots of agony , it glides through the tangles with very little effort .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is designed for professional salons for dry or wet hair, is no problem for this large brush.Great comfort for scalp thanks to the cushion that allows the nylon pins to glide through the natural flow of your hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more hair loss or broken hair by rearranging the split ends and removing dead hair, having a regenerating role on hair.Kids will also love it as they will not have to bear the pains of a comb pulling on their hair and damaging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush works amazingly and is very attractive to boot.I highly recommend this brush to have for all your needs , I will not buy any other kind of brush again .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this brush to everyone with tangled hair and kids.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter who has hair down to the middle of her back...She absolutely loves this brush....It has a great shape and is easier to pull through her hair than a regular brush with a round handle.</li>
    <li> My daughter is 5 years old with long hair. Every night after washing her hair we spent lots of time detangling it. This brush is amazing! It glides through her hair.&lt;br /&gt;We love it and she can brush her own hair with it.</li>
    <li> This is the best detangling brush I have seen so far.  My daughter love using this brush.  Before purchasing this brush, she would use a brush once in a blue moon. Since having this brush, she brushed her hair every day.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Great brush!! It really works.  Don&#x27;t buy the other ones that look similar-- we tried one other kind and had to return it.  This one is good.</li>
    <li> I have a 3 year old that hates to have her hair brushed and throws a fit about it each and every time. So when I was offered this Detangling Brush for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered one to at least try. It arrived and I washed her hair then proceeded to brush it with her fancy new detangling brush. OMG she didn&#x27;t even whimper!!!!! I definitely love this brush and the fact that it saved my daughter a tantrum. I would recommend this Detangling Hairbrush for anyone who has a sensitive scalp or a tangled mess.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this brush! Does exactly what it says beautifully. Glides through hair and detangles with ease. Vertically no hair is in the brush after brushing, which means no breakage for my fine hair. LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! A must have beauty accessory......GREAT gift idea!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this brush for my Granddaughter and she will use it. However, I wish I found this years ago because I love how it glides through my hair as well. You wont be sorry if you buy this brush I promise you !!</li>
    <li> I actually had a detangler brush and I needed a new one because the bristles where bending all awkwardly. So I purchased this one and it works really well. 👍</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Wish they made them for left handed people like me. Other than that, I give it 110%</li>
    <li> I was surprised that it was lightweight and hollow... too light. a little cheap. but my daughter is very happy bruushing her hair with it she says it isn&#x60;t as painful.</li>
    <li> I have a little girl with a tender head and she loves it! Works well getting tangles out without too much pulling!</li>
    <li> THIS DETANGLING BRUSH IS PERFECT FOR THOSE SOFT HEAD TYPES THAT ARE EASILY HURT BY TANGLED HAIR!! I RECEIVED THIS ITEM AT A DISCOUNTED RATE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW.</li>
    <li> I have three girls and I can tell you this brush is WONDERFUL!  My oldest has shoulder length thick naturally curly hair, middle one has thin straight (and I mean STRAIGHT lol) hair that currently goes to the middle of her back and my little one has thick straight with wavy patches... So you can see that we have a little of everything.  They all love this brush. It really does glide through their hair with ease.  We got this a few months ago and they constantly fight over it so I came back today to get a couple more to have on hand.  It&#x27;s small enough that we can take it easily with us anywhere.  It really is a good brush!</li>
    <li> Awesome product and quality. Works great on my daughter&#x27;s hair. Love the color also. Very light so easy to handle.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that long, and it snarls badly when I wash it. I had high hopes that this brush would reduce the time, energy and pain I went through combing it out. It helped some, but not as much as I had hoped, and it didn&#x27;t cut down on the time at all. This brush is very cheaply made, and the bristles bend far too easily. If they were sturdier, they would separate the strands of hair easier.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing for my morning routine with my 11 year old. She wants to grow her hair out, but the battle of combing though her fine hair was getting to be too much. She&#x27;d be crying and I&#x27;d be frustrated. Then we received this detangling brush and our morning ritual goes much smoother and we both leave happier. We love how easily this brush runs through hair. It really glides. It works on my daughters, thin, fine hair and my thick coarse hair. Both of us have hair well below our shoulders. This brush takes care of business without tugging. It fits comfortably in the her small hand, and my larger adult hand. I notice with my hair less hair is being left in the hair brush and we have yet to meet a tangle in my daughter&#x27;s hair that this brush couldn&#x27;t manage without tugging, tearing or pain!</li>
    <li> My wife really likes this brush to detangle my daughters hair. It is a huge improvement over a standard brush and definitely causes less pain when brushing out tangles.</li>
    <li> Detangling Brush is the most oddly shaped brush I have ever used! And know what? It works!&lt;br /&gt;Great ergonomic design makes brushing motion easy and natural. The bristles do the de-tangle job just as they say they will. Who knew! Well... I knew that a wide comb and a narrow comb worked differently. Why not apply that to a brush? My hair stylist has been holding out on me. ;) These are the next stocking stuffer, girl gift basket, just &#x27;cause I love ya gifts! Your friend and family are going to love you, too! Buy several as backup gifts, today!</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter, she has very long hair. It works very well.</li>
    <li> This little brush is simply amazing.  My Goddaughter whines and cries every single time we have to brush her hair.  It&#x27;s even worse after time in the pool. It seems she has a sensitive scalp.  I purchased this brush on a whim and it turns out it is truly painless.  I don&#x27;t know what the trick is but it just works and gently.  And it definitely detangles all the knots.  You just have to go through the stubborn knots a few times.  I have now ordered 3 more so we can have them at all our family pool homes.</li>
    <li> My 3 daughter&#x27;s love this brush.  Definitely have to buy a couple more!  Doesn&#x27;t hurt them and makes their hair so smooth. And, it&#x27;s a perfect size handle for them to hold and brush as well.</li>
    <li> I fall in love with this brush. No words super</li>
    <li> I have long and very, very thick hair. I spend a lot of time trying to get the tangles and knots out. Unfortunately, I usually end up with a headache from all of the yanking and pulling. I fell in love with Detangling Brush Pink Hair Brush. I must admit, when I first saw it, I thought it was pretty weird looking. It features dual bristles staggered at 2 different levels specifically designed to create an effortless glide through hair motion. The bristles are designed to tease out knots with each stroke. It fits my hand perfectly, and is very comfortable to use. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who needs an amazing hair brush!&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review</li>
    <li> We have one for the bathroom, and one for the kids. I love the no more screaming when we brush the kids hair.</li>
    <li> Love it! Arrived on time and it smooths my hair without pulling it! I have medium thick hair and its wavy.</li>
    <li> Great looking brush.  I like the shape and size.  My daughter loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> As a woman with thick hair, I&#x27;ve tried a whole lot of brushes. Most don&#x27;t last long - either they won&#x27;t go through my hair, or they break (either break the brush or break my hair). This one though is perfect. It feel good in my hand, feels good on my hair, and just plain works. After all, a brush should work to get rid of the tangles, right? Besides, I really like the bright pink too!</li>
    <li> I ordered this detangling brush for my 2 girls.  I have a 3 and 5 year old with fine hair, and when they wake up, I call it their &amp;#34;bird&#x27;s nest&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s such a mess.  This brush moves through their hair very easily, and helps get the tangles out without pain.  It works well on wet or dry hair, and I also use it on my hair too!  I have a similar brush, but it doesn&#x27;t have a handle like this one.  This one is easy to use to brush out hair and do ponytails since it has a handle.  It is also easy for them to use to brush their own hair.</li>
    <li> I love this hairbrush!!  The handle is the nicest.  It fits in your hand perfectly.  The bristles are not too stiff so your hair doesn&#x27;t break when brushed.  They also feel nice on your scalp.  I love pink so this was a bonus.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;It doesn&#x27;t hurt, mama!&amp;#34; That&#x27;s what my daughter said to me when I first tried this on her - withOUT our normal detangling spray. It&#x27;s such a great size and shape, it&#x27;s easy for me to use on her, as well as for her to use herself.  She is almost 3 and has that fine thin hair that tangles if you look at it funny. Not only does this brush make quick work of the tangles, but it also helps smooth her hair to keep it from getting as tangled in the first place. Plus, she calls it her princess brush because of it&#x27;s amazingly awesome pink color.</li>
    <li> This Brush was exactly what I was looking for! I LOVE IT!! Th handle is shaped so it is easy to hold, the bristles are not to hard and it does a great job at detangling!</li>
    <li> Our morning school routine can be very hectic, and trying to brush three heads of long hair gets ridiculous. Seriously, it use to be stressful, but this awesome brush has been a lifesaver! My daughters love the short handle..it&#x27;s perfect for their little hands, and I love that they are able to use it easily themselves. And no more tears brushing out tangles! Great product...highly recommend!!</li>
