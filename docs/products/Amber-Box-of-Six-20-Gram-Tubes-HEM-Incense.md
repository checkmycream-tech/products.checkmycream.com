    <li> My partner and I love the fragance of this Amber incense. Great cleanser and iluminating vibe for every room. Excellent for angelic calling.</li>
    <li> this amber is intoxicating, both bitter and sweet at once. it will easily become the dominant smell in the room, so use with care. if you prefer a lighter scent, this is probably not for you. if you are like me and enjoy a rich, strong scent that lingers on, this will not disappoint.</li>
    <li> Lovely, sweet, fragrance. Reminds me very much of the incense at Mass. I wasn&#x27;t sure what &amp;#34;amber&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;would smell like, but this is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I originally found this in a store in a small box for a higher price. I enjoy it regularly. Many of my clients and friends enjoy the deep pleasant scent. It is split up in many packages.

    <li> Amber is simply the best of so many scents, particularly when HEM does it. Like marigolds in a fall garden Amber is just an obvious choice that anyone can love.</li>
    <li> The Amber scent is ok but not great enough to buy again. Had to burn several at a time to smell it in a room. Peace</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this incense before, and I love it. It&#x27;s one of the few amber incenses out there I do like. Long-burning and delicious.</li>
    <li> There are many types of incense I don&#x27;t really enjoy.  Some are too strong or smoky.  This HEM Amber incense is lovely and has a kind of warm clean spicy smell.  It&#x27;s my go to when I want something that isn&#x27;t really overwhelming, but that makes my home smell welcoming, clean and is a scent many seem to enjoy.</li>

    <li> Great smelling incense.  Good burning time.</li>
    <li> this incense has a mellow flavor with tangy under tones.  If you are looking for a sweet scent throughout, you may be disappointed.  Think of it this way, a light flowery scent with just a hint of citrus.  If that sounds good, then these are for you.  Also I have found HEM to be one of the best brands and the price always seems to be right.</li>
    <li> I have always enjoyed HEM brand incense and I have purchased more than a few boxes from this seller. I have never been disappointed.

    <li> A heavenly scent. Reminds me of high mass. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Nice soft scent. hard to explain. Sweet, gently scented. I like this one. I will order again. Highly reccommended. Has a cake like scent. Try it. You&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> The incense is nicely packaged and promptly arrived but it is a bit &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; for my liking.  It hits my nose pretty strong, not subtle at all, so isn&#x27;t well suited for my use with meditation.  Other Amber incense I have purchased have not been this way so I think it&#x27;s this particular manufacturer. Others may enjoy the strong scent.</li>
    <li> I love the HEM brand of incense. Amber smells really good and comes with a lot of sticks. This is the best deal for your money</li>
