      <li>I have very fine long hair that is prone to get oily fast in south Florida...</li>
      <li>My daughter has curly hair that tangles much.</li>
      <li>and this makes it so much easier to manage post shower.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this to use on my 18 month old&#x27;s fine blonde hair to stop the frizz.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Her hair is a little more manageable with its use.</li>
      <li>We have used it for both of our children and we love all of the Little Twig products.</li>
      <li>the next day I go back to using my old conditioner (suave rosemary &amp; mint--works very well at detangling, but it&#x27;s not tear free).</li>

    <li> Great conditioner and detangler for baby and toddler hair. Nice smell. Not too overpowering. I only notice the smell during application, not once it&#x27;s washed out. Softens my daughter&#x27;s hair and makes combing after bathtime much easier! Will likely purchase the companion shampoo once I&#x27;m out of my current one.</li>
    <li> Awesome buy! Great product. Highly recommend it. Easy to use and very useful when having curly hair. Makes the process so easy</li>
    <li> Allergen-free &amp; great for sensitive scalps. Every other shampoo makes my kid&#x27;s scalp itch due to her allergies. Also gets the tangles out of her fine hair without weighing it down. Good product.</li>
    <li> I use this on my 2 years old daughter&#x27;s hair. She has eczema and it does not make her itch or irritate her skin.</li>
    <li> My children have delicate skin. This is the only conditioner I could find that did not smell terrible. The sent is great, it dosent sting their eyes and it detangles well. even though its an investment, a small drop does the trick so one bottle lasts a long time</li>
    <li> I love this product for my daughter&#x27;s hair. She has very curly, fine hair and it gets knotted very easily and this stuff works wonders! I just wet her hair and massage through the tangles for a couple minutes. It leaves her hair, soft, silky and smooth. I have tried other brands but nothing compares to this one. Our favorite is the lavender :)</li>
    <li> great stuff, works better than California baby, has a less chemically odor. Also, love the pump. I have seen this in Target as well, seemed to be about the same price as on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Granted this is the only hair conditioner I ever bought for my daughter, i do like it. Her hair is a little more manageable with its use.</li>
    <li> My daughter has curly hair that tangles much. After reading good reviews here on amazon I decided to give it a try. And never regretted. It smells nice and indeed makes combing much easier.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The only option in the market that actually works... it prevents tangling between washes... I love it! I may be expensive at first but it lasts very long and it actually serves its purpose unlike several products.</li>
    <li> Light weight which is perfect for my thin haired toddler who gets rats nest tangles at the back of her head. The smell is lovely.</li>
    <li> My baby&#x27;s hair is soft, she is just 14 month, and it&#x27;s easy to get knots. As baby hair wash without conditioner caused the hair dry and dull, little twig is stunning product, after several uses, the knots is gone, and kidda shinny effect appears. Will recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use on my 18 month old&#x27;s fine blonde hair to stop the frizz.  It works great.  I decided to try it on myself as well and my scalp is so itchy.  I&#x27;m not sure which of the organic ingredients is causing this?  He does not seem to have an adverse reaction to it so I will continue to use it on him but probably will not re purchase.</li>
    <li> My daughter has terrible problems with tangles. It&#x27;s a big struggle at my house. She has decided that she wants to keep her hair long, so I was looking for a good detangler to get us through. This isn&#x27;t it. It smells good and works okay as a conditioner, but I didn&#x27;t feel like it did much in the way of detangling. I was trying to comb through the tangles in the tub with the conditioner in and I was getting nowhere. Finally I just gave up and rinsed it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then when I empty the tub, there is all this yellow/orange stuff lining the sides of my tub. The conditioner itself is white but I use burt&#x27;s bees shampoo, which is yellow/orange. I have used the burts bees for years, so I know it&#x27;s not the problem. I can only guess that the color comes from the shampoo, but there is no film when I use the shampoo alone. It looked disgusting. So I scrub the tub, which took AWHILE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the next day I go back to using my old conditioner (suave rosemary &amp; mint--works very well at detangling, but it&#x27;s not tear free). So then a few days later, I run out of suave and try to use the little twig again. The film on my tub is back when i empty the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to get good reviews, so apparently a lot of folks like it. It does smell good, but the price is really high and it certainly did not detangle better than what I was already using. I use suave rosemary &amp; mint in the tub as it detangles well and then if she doesn&#x27;t get detangled in the tub, I use disney princess detangler and a boar bristle hair brush. These work well. The only reason i switched was because she got conditioner in her eyes and was really upset. I will just have to be more careful when I rinse her hair because I&#x27;m certainly not interested in scrubbing my tub every day!</li>
    <li> Our son has curls and this conditioner has been a life saver.  One word of caution it is a thick conditioner so you need to rinse it good otherwise it will leave a residue. I don&#x27;t know how anyone could use it as a leave-in conditioner which is an option they give. They scent is very light &amp; doesn&#x27;t irritate my sons very sensitive skin. We liked the conditioner so much we even bought the shampoo.</li>
    <li> Awesome product ...my 5yr&#x27;s hair is very soft after using this....n i use it to. I am 32....love it</li>
    <li> a little goes a long way. fantastic leave in conditioner for adult hair too!  I have very fine long hair that is prone to get oily fast in south Florida...this stuff is awesome!!!  Added plus....a 2 on EWG</li>
    <li> Does work rather well but you do need to use quite a bit and you also should purchase a separate detangler brush.</li>
    <li> Immediately upon applying my daughters hair was smooth and easy to comb through.  Amazing product!  Have a 2 year old with thin curly hair about shoulder length and this makes it so much easier to manage post shower.  Leaves hair soft with curls perfect.  Highly recommend, just switched from California Baby and glad I did.</li>
    <li> Finally!  A lightweight conditioner that leaves toddler hair (and I now use it on myself too!) tangle free and beautiful.  Of course, we are thrilled with the non-toxic formulation as well.</li>
    <li> Our 18 month old daughter has very thin, very long hair.  (Almost to the middle of her back.)  It isn&#x27;t all the same length, and we were considering cutting it as it was becoming very frizzy and fly-away.  We now use this conditioning detangler after every bath and we love it.  No more talk of having to cut her hair - the frizzles have been tamed.</li>
    <li> Great organic product!  We have used it for both of our children and we love all of the Little Twig products.</li>
    <li> Baby conditioner is so hard to find, so Amazon the the rescue.  This stuff smells great and makes my kids hair soft.  We have a wood burner and our home is really dry, so I love having this to make my kids more comfortable.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not heavy and is also a good detangler.  OK if you don&#x27;t wash out...love that it is all natural.</li>
    <li> My guy has curls (&#x3D; tangles) and this stuff works great in his hair. Tear free and makes combing his hair easier on both of us. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner! The smell is also amazing. Works wonders on my daughters super fine hair. I also like the pump dispenser.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is by far the BEST I have ever used on my daughter&#x27;s head. She&#x27;s 2.5yrs old who has fine hair past her shoulder blades and ... hates having her hair brushed! Yuck! I only have to use a dime sized amount (nickel-sized if she&#x27;s been in the wind) &amp; I can brush out all of the tangles with very little to no tears. We love California Baby for their soaps, bubble baths, &amp; lotions, but when we tried their conditioner I was not impressed at all. To get any tangles/knots out you have to use A LOT but then my daughter&#x27;s hair looks greasy the very next day. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention Amazon&#x27;s service! When my first order arrived &amp; the pump head was broken, I called right away &amp; they replaced it immediately with a whole new bottle! So now I have 2 bottles of the best conditioner out there for my daughter - that will last me YEARS!!! Now I&#x27;M stuck using up the California Baby conditioner. ;)</li>
    <li> I got this product because I have allergies to ordinary conditioners. This doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and does detangle well; the itch factor is gone too. It doesn&#x27;t replace conditioner, though. Smells good, but the smell doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> My almost two year old daughter has nice thick wavy hair.  Shampoo can be a little drying, so I thought this detangler might help.  It definitely helps with detangling the hair, but the product weighed down her hair so it looked greasy.  In addition, her beautiful waves/curls no longer bounced.  I stopped using this product and started using Jayson&#x27;s Childrens Conditioner.  That product does not weigh her hair down and there are zero tangles when combing through her hair.</li>
    <li> I tried this for my daughter&#x27;s hair. she is biracial. All it did was dry her hair out, and it didn&#x27;t really detangle. It was not meant for her hair type, might work for another hair type though.</li>
    <li> Smells soooo good! Leaves daughter&#x27;s hair very smooth and no more complaining when i have to brush her hair! Works great!</li>
    <li> This is thick and rich and smells good. I had no problems getting all of the tangles out with this.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my little daughter who has long straight hair!  every time when I was combing her hair, she would complain! I cut her hair every 3 months to avoid tangled tips but she would still complain.&lt;br /&gt;After I applied this conditioner to her hair for the first time, her hair was so smooth that she was surprised!  It smells really nice too!&lt;br /&gt;You only need to apply a little bit of this conditioner to the tip of the hair (not the roots).  It takes a little longer than a normal rains to wash it off, but you can feel the softness immediately.  We&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now!</li>
    <li> My daughter has long thick hair that gets into tight awful tangles that look like dread locks. This is the only thing that actually works to enable me to get these knots out. I put a blob of it onto the knot, work it in a bit and undo the knot with my fingers and a wide tooth tangle comb. It truly is the best and only thing I have found that really works. I love the lavender scent to calm us while we remove those knots!</li>
