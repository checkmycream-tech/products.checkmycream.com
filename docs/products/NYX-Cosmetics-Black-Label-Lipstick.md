### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent, quality lipstick.</li>
      <li>Very sexy look!</li>
      <li>Looks great and lasts all night.</li>
      <li>I knew it wasn&#x27;t a matte lipstick, which is my favorite and the best for my lifestyle.  </li>
      <li>This is an excellent product and it arrived VERY quickly.  </li>
      <li>but then you&#x27;ll be good to go.  </li>
      <li>The pigment isn&#x27;t great, you have to apply quite a bit of it to get good coverage, but it does go on nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>The lipstick goes on really smooth and works great as a \\&quot;base-coat\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>It gives off an oily kind of feel and isn&#x27;t my favorite NYX product, and I LOOOOVE NYX.  </li>
      <li>However on the bright side my item came extremely fast upon request which I was very satisfied about</li>
      <li>I Love it.</li>
      <li>That being said, the lipstick is okay.</li>
      <li>I was expecting more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
      <li>I generally LOVE NYX cosmetics</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work for me on its own but work beautifully to deepen and enrich other colors.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth after that and doesn&#x27;t come off easily.  </li>
      <li>love it, its moisturizing, black and beautiful.</li>
      <li>But for the time being, its good enough.</li>
      <li>lipstick itself is true to its color and it covers your lips well.  </li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>I needed black lipstick to cosplay as Harley Quinn and wanted something with good pigment unlike the cheap stuff you find around Halloween.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>It would be nice if some of the bigger makeup brands would put out darker lipstcks</li>
      <li>so if you want a very quick and fast service I recommend this seller but on the lipstick not so much.</li>
      <li>I like it, and it&#x27;s perfect for my Rose Lalonde cosplay, however you do have too put on a layer of lipstick, then a layer of black eyeshadow because the lipstick isn&#x27;t dark enough.</li>
      <li>It looks very well when added to pinks and reds.</li>
      <li>though it was although it very moisturizing</li>
      <li>My old black lipstick which I bought at Hot Topic for about $3 worked 10x better than this.</li>
      <li>After reading the reviews I was expecting this lipstick to be of higher quality, but in fact the lipstick is very transparent, even after several coats.</li>
      <li>It is fairly resistant to transfer or leaving behind SWAKs.</li>
      <li>very soft and lip gloss did not have to be added to it.</li>
      <li>The first application doesn&#x27;t go so well, so maybe rub a little on your hand first,</li>
      <li>Also protects your lips from the dry-out of the liner and keeps them completely moisturized.</li>
      <li>it changed the color of my lips to a very darkish navy blue color.</li>
      <li>It takes soooo many layers for it to even look dark grey.</li>
      <li>Next time I will try a new brand.</li>
      <li>My wife enjoy dark colour &amp; myself too &amp; the product cover well and is long lasting.</li>
      <li>need multiple applications to get the dark, full coverage but it doesnt flake up on me or make my lips feel dry.</li>
      <li>So if you want a very pigmented matte black lipstick this lipstick is not for you.</li>

<li> The color is a bit dull and it doesn&#x27;t seem to blend very well.</li>
<li> and it doesn&#x27;t long at all.</li>
<li> This lipstick is not what I expected this black lipstick is not pigmented enough and its very sheer and glossy.</li>
<li> It doesnt last long and you have to go over a few times to get it dark.</li>
<li> So I guess I can&#x27;t be too disappointed, but this lipstick doesn&#x27;t stay true enough to pigment for me.  </li>
<li> This lipstick wasn&#x27;t as dark as I expecting</li>
<li> Its really hard to find black lipstick, at least in the area I live in.</li>
<li> I put some black kohl eye pencil to line my lips and some translucent powder to matte my lips because of its glossy texture but it didn&#x27;t work out how I wanted to, even though it did matte my lips</li>
<li> This lipstick does not look black at all.</li>
<li> The black is not as harsh as I thought it would be..</li>
<li> I usually just put this on, then go over all of it with a jet black eyeliner.</li>
<li> Wanted a black lipstick, this is it, I would recommend it, but not sure whether others will like it like me.</li>
<li> This lipstick does not cover well, and comes off with hardly any effort.</li>
<li> I was skeptical about this purchase.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This lipstick does not look black at all. It takes soooo many layers for it to even look dark grey.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product and it arrived VERY quickly.  It took only one day to make it to my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lipstick itself is true to its color and it covers your lips well.  The first application doesn&#x27;t go so well, so maybe rub a little on your hand first, but then you&#x27;ll be good to go.  Goes on smooth after that and doesn&#x27;t come off easily.  Excellent, quality lipstick.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I was expecting this lipstick to be of higher quality, but in fact the lipstick is very transparent, even after several coats. My old black lipstick which I bought at Hot Topic for about $3 worked 10x better than this.</li>

    <li> The color is a bit dull and it doesn&#x27;t seem to blend very well. It&#x27;s just ok. I was expecting more.</li>
    <li> I bought this lipstick for my Halloween costume. For $7+ you&#x27;d think you would be getting a quality product, but that couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth. This lipstick does not cover well, and comes off with hardly any effort. If you value your money DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> This lipstick is not what I expected this black lipstick is not pigmented enough and its very sheer and glossy. I put some black kohl eye pencil to line my lips and some translucent powder to matte my lips because of its glossy texture but it didn&#x27;t work out how I wanted to, even though it did matte my lips it changed the color of my lips to a very darkish navy blue color. So if you want a very pigmented matte black lipstick this lipstick is not for you.

    <li> I needed black lipstick to cosplay as Harley Quinn and wanted something with good pigment unlike the cheap stuff you find around Halloween. I generally LOVE NYX cosmetics so I have this a try. It&#x27;s okay. The pigment isn&#x27;t great, you have to apply quite a bit of it to get good coverage, but it does go on nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this purchase. A friend recommended I try it. It doesn&#x27;t work for me on its own but work beautifully to deepen and enrich other colors.</li>
    <li> Its really hard to find black lipstick, at least in the area I live in. So when I seen the price of this I immediately ordered. That being said, the lipstick is okay. It doesnt last long and you have to go over a few times to get it dark. But for the time being, its good enough. Next time I will try a new brand.</li>
    <li> This lipstick wasn&#x27;t as dark as I expecting and it doesn&#x27;t long at all. It would be nice if some of the bigger makeup brands would put out darker lipstcks</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. The lipstick goes on really smooth and works great as a \\&quot;base-coat\\&quot;. To get it darker I usually just put this on, then go over all of it with a jet black eyeliner. Looks great and lasts all night. Also protects your lips from the dry-out of the liner and keeps them completely moisturized. I Love it.</li>
    <li> The black is not as harsh as I thought it would be..very soft and lip gloss did not have to be added to it. It looks very well when added to pinks and reds.</li>
    <li> I hope they never run out of this lipstick!!&lt;br /&gt;I love it, its moisturizing, black and beautiful. I will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> My wife enjoy dark colour &amp; myself too &amp; the product cover well and is long lasting. Very sexy look!</li>
    <li> I knew it wasn&#x27;t a matte lipstick, which is my favorite and the best for my lifestyle.  So I guess I can&#x27;t be too disappointed, but this lipstick doesn&#x27;t stay true enough to pigment for me.  It gives off an oily kind of feel and isn&#x27;t my favorite NYX product, and I LOOOOVE NYX.  I&#x27;m hoping I can find a way to pair it with a lip liner pencil and make this work out.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I though it was although it very moisturizing that&#x27;s it. I will never purchase it again, it should be stated its not a matte.</li>
    <li> Its so creamy when you put it on! I&#x27;ve only had to reapply it after 4 plus hours or eating. Not necessarily when drinking though. It is fairly resistant to transfer or leaving behind SWAKs. Well worth the money.</li>
