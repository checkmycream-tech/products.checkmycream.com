      <li>Having the rough and fine sides is awesome.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s wonderful compared to the other crappy ones.</li>
      <li>If you wnat to treat your feet to a good scrubbing, purchase this particular fpedicure tool.  </li>
      <li>But overall it is a great asset</li>
      <li>It was very simple and had great results.</li>
      <li>No questioning the quality here, it is not some cheap Oriental import.</li>
      <li>Great to keep in the shower and use daily.</li>
      <li>I like the design handle, it&#x27;s easy to clean</li>
      <li>Quick and easy.</li>
      <li>A very nice and reasonable priced tool and should last for many years to come.</li>
      <li>It rinses clean quickly.</li>
      <li>The price is right -- very well made and easy to clean.</li>
      <li>Very light weight, a bit lighter construction than I&#x27;d have preferred but does a completely satisfactory job.</li>
      <li>Great little foot file.  </li>
      <li>Works well and  the price was right.</li>
      <li>I have more control, and get a better job done in less time than with any pumice stone I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Worth the money, its really well made.</li>
      <li>It really does get out that ground in dirt from gardening in flip flops!</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s pretty sturdy, also I could not find this anywhere else in the stores but here.</li>
      <li>and i love it its has two side with different situations</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t exactly the sexiest purchase, but the tool gets the job done.</li>
      <li>I soak my heels first and then use the file to remove the softened callus&#x27; .</li>
      <li>It is far superior to any other file I have ever found.</li>
      <li>If u are looking for a nice little rasp to keep up inbetween pedicures</li>
      <li>This foot file is well made and works very well.  </li>
      <li>Made of stainless steel &amp; does the job well.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this 5 stars plus!</li>
      <li>afterwords really helps.</li>
      <li>Being stainless steel, it does not rust.  </li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s why I use it so much it.</li>
      <li>Really don&#x27;t find this product helpful at all.....</li>
      <li>handy little item!</li>
      <li>and I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>well if you want to smooth a rough patch of skin on your feet.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t just smooth over the rough spot, it literally removes them,  </li>
      <li>but if you have some scary heels I bet it would do a great job.</li>
      <li>It takes more of the dead skin off of your feet than the ped egg does.</li>
      <li>love this product - i&#x27;ve been using flexible sanding blocks in coarse to take care of me feets, but this product, built with quality stainless grating using German ingenuity, will last me a lifetime...</li>
      <li>Though This product was listed as new</li>
      <li>Having the two sides - rough and fine - allows its use on more delicate areas as well as tougher areas like heels.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy and requires barely any effort.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ve added another file on the other side, which was very smart, the emory board side really didn&#x27;t do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>use this so frequently</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how much more solid and substantial this foot file is compared to those I have had in the past.</li>
      <li>My feet look like I haven&#x27;t spent the whole summer walking around barefoot!</li>
      <li>This thing is a little much for me</li>

<li> This thing is a little much for me</li>
<li> That said, the shape of the foot file allows it to rest on a flat surface, and there is no stain left behind, and it dries quickly.</li>
<li> I expect it will last a long time.</li>
<li> /&gt;i&#x27;m just a little peeved that the men&#x27;s version (exactly the same product) is slightly cheaper...</li>
<li> Works well, does the job and holds up to long term use.  </li>
<li> how long you sand an area of skin.</li>
<li> This file removes calluses equally as well, but it leaves the skin rough because it doesn&#x27;t have the emery-board-style sanding surface that the Ped Egg includes.</li>
<li> this file makes my feet more bad...</li>
<li> I have pretty thick and hard calluses on my heels</li>
<li> This file keeps the cracks from spreading and becoming painful.</li>
<li> and i always look for the toughest and roughest thing i can find to scrape them down with.</li>
<li> I previously used a Ped Egg and bought this because I wanted a file with a handle.</li>
<li> I am disappointed that it only took 3 years for the handle to snap off, but thanks to the shape I can hold it in my palm and still use it.</li>
<li> And if you want something heavy duty for you calluses, this is also it.</li>
<li> I bought it locally few years ago at Bed Bath and Beyond.</li>
<li> it is waste money.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never used this type of item before, but my heels needed some heavy duty work.</li>
<li> Too bad I found it so late in the summer, because my heels now look human, not like its time for a trip to the blacksmith for new shoes.</li>
<li> The file does not remove thick callouses no matter how hard you press or you</li>
<li> I am a gardener and my feet get really dirty</li>
<li> I have terrible, thick calluses on my heels.  </li>
<li> While it looks wicked, don&#x27;t be afraid!</li>
<li> but I&#x27;ve had a horrible callus on my foot for months from running and a friend suggested a foot file.  </li>

    <li> This foot rasp worked alot better than i thought it would. I have pretty thick and hard calluses on my heels and i always look for the toughest and roughest thing i can find to scrape them down with. I always assume that if it works for the avg person, then i need something tougher. This file did the job and i was amazed. If u are looking for a nice little rasp to keep up inbetween pedicures this is it. And if you want something heavy duty for you calluses, this is also it.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how much more solid and substantial this foot file is compared to those I have had in the past. The handle is perfectly shaped and has silicone like inserts on each side that make it easy to grip, even when hands are wet and soapy. Having the two sides - rough and fine - allows its use on more delicate areas as well as tougher areas like heels. I would have loved it even better if there were some sort of hole or hanging apparatus on the handle so I could hang it in the shower rather than balance it on my wire shelves. But overall it is a great asset and I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a foot file aficionado but I&#x27;ve had a horrible callus on my foot for months from running and a friend suggested a foot file.  This one did the job nicely.  The price is right -- very well made and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Works well and  the price was right.</li>
    <li> I like the design handle, it&#x27;s easy to clean and it&#x27;s very effective. I definitely recommend this to anyone. Made in Germany so it&#x27;s pretty sturdy, also I could not find this anywhere else in the stores but here. Amazon is the only place that I know that carries this.</li>
    <li> love this product - i&#x27;ve been using flexible sanding blocks in coarse to take care of me feets, but this product, built with quality stainless grating using German ingenuity, will last me a lifetime...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m just a little peeved that the men&#x27;s version (exactly the same product) is slightly cheaper...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but i&#x27;m happy with this product!</li>
    <li> gets the job done. good handle for easy use.</li>
    <li> this thing has changed the way my feet look and i love it its has two side with different situations</li>
    <li> Works well, does the job and holds up to long term use.  For the price, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.  Great to keep in the shower and use daily.</li>
    <li> While it looks wicked, don&#x27;t be afraid! It fits nicely in the hand, and gives easy control even when soapy. I have more control, and get a better job done in less time than with any pumice stone I have ever used. It rinses clean quickly. No questioning the quality here, it is not some cheap Oriental import. I did take away one star because there is no hole or loop in the handle to hang it up in the shower. That said, the shape of the foot file allows it to rest on a flat surface, and there is no stain left behind, and it dries quickly. I expect it will last a long time. Too bad I found it so late in the summer, because my heels now look human, not like its time for a trip to the blacksmith for new shoes.</li>
    <li> This file is sturdy, easy to grip, and very easy to use in the shower. I previously used a Ped Egg and bought this because I wanted a file with a handle. This file removes calluses equally as well, but it leaves the skin rough because it doesn&#x27;t have the emery-board-style sanding surface that the Ped Egg includes. I also wish it had a rope or hole so I could hang it up in the shower.</li>
    <li> Purchased on 12/31/2011, the handle broke in 2014. I am disappointed that it only took 3 years for the handle to snap off, but thanks to the shape I can hold it in my palm and still use it. It isn&#x27;t as efficient as before and it has torn up my palms a couple of times.</li>
    <li> The best I have ever used in the market!!! It&#x27;s very sturdy and requires barely any effort. I can&#x27;t believe the price point. It&#x27;s wonderful compared to the other crappy ones.</li>
    <li> Doesnt work as well as i hoped. Wish it had something to hang it up with.</li>
    <li> the best foot file I have ever used. I started using them at a salon that did my pedicures. It takes more of the dead skin off of your feet than the ped egg does. I have used a variety of foot files and this one is the best. I give it 5 stars. :)</li>
    <li> This thing is a little much for me but if you have some scary heels I bet it would do a great job.</li>
    <li> The packaging arrived damaged and stapled back together... Though This product was listed as new I can Only can assume this item had been used... Yuck</li>
    <li> Made of stainless steel &amp; does the job well. If you wnat to treat your feet to a good scrubbing, purchase this particular fpedicure tool.  judyh</li>
    <li> Really don&#x27;t find this product helpful at all.....my pumice stone works better than this!  In my opinion, the use of the Pedi-egg combined with the pumice stone to smooth yields the best results.</li>
    <li> Works well for the purposes it&#x27;s made for.  Very light weight, a bit lighter construction than I&#x27;d have preferred but does a completely satisfactory job.</li>
    <li> This metal file is a wonderful rasp. It seems to be out of production as I only found one source. It is far superior to any other file I have ever found.</li>
    <li> This is my third purchase of this product. I bought it locally few years ago at Bed Bath and Beyond. when I returned to buy it again, it was gone! I looked for it online and thank goodness I found it. This is the best foot file I have ever used! It doesn&#x27;t just smooth over the rough spot, it literally removes them,  it also takes away cracking of the heels and any ground-in dirt. They&#x27;ve added another file on the other side, which was very smart, the emory board side really didn&#x27;t do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this so frequently it seems like I go through one a year. I am a gardener and my feet get really dirty and that&#x27;s why I use it so much it. It really does get out that ground in dirt from gardening in flip flops! Lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this 5 stars plus!</li>
    <li> Worth the money, its really well made.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used this type of item before, but my heels needed some heavy duty work. It was very simple and had great results. My feet look like I haven&#x27;t spent the whole summer walking around barefoot! (which of course I did). A couple of use suggestions: Use BEFORE you take a shower and some nice moisturizer specifically for the foot afterwords really helps.</li>
    <li> A very nice and reasonable priced tool and should last for many years to come. My soles have never felt better!</li>
    <li> this file makes my feet more bad... don&#x27;t wanna recommend to anyone. it is waste money. i used several times and never worked properly and finally.. guess what. i already throw this away to trash can....</li>
    <li> Received order as promise. It was package well. It was what I expected...will order again. I have used another product for a couple years but when I tried this product I loved it.</li>
    <li> This foot file works well if you want to smooth a rough patch of skin on your feet.  The file does not remove thick callouses no matter how hard you press or you how long you sand an area of skin.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re getting good use from this. Works well</li>
    <li> This was suggested toe by a friend.  I have no idea what makes it different but something does.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Callused heals have bothered me for many years. I soak my heels first and then use the file to remove the softened callus&#x27; . Quick and easy.</li>
    <li> Great little foot file.  I have terrible, thick calluses on my heels.  This thing made short work of them in no time.  I like the double sides for rough/fine,  handy little item!</li>
    <li> This foot file is well made and works very well.  Being stainless steel, it does not rust.  It would be nice if it had a rope hanger to hang up in the shower.  I would recommend it -- it&#x27;s a good product!</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t exactly the sexiest purchase, but the tool gets the job done. The handle is curved and that makes it easier to reach all areas of your calloused regions easier to reach. Hooray. Now I can wear flip-flops and my girlfriend won&#x27;t look at my feet in disgust. She seems to care more than I do about how my feet look.</li>
    <li> Having the rough and fine sides is awesome. I wear flip flops a lot which caused my feet to become cracked around the heels. This file keeps the cracks from spreading and becoming painful.</li>
