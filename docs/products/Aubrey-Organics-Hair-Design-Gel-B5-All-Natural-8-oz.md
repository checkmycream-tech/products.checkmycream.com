      <li>Thank you, works really well and smells nice too.  </li>
      <li>keeps hair soft, good hold</li>
      <li>It works pretty good, I found it best to put on shortly after a shower as it seems to work better when you hair is slightly damp.</li>
      <li>Good to use with long hair and not short,  doesnt leave much residue which is good but takes more amount</li>
      <li>Other than that its great.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have very porous hair and products have a habit of just sitting on top of my hair, but I find this product is well absorbed into my hair by the end of the day.</li>
      <li>I love this product, it&#x27;s very natural</li>
      <li>Love using natural products!</li>
      <li>Threw it away, wasn&#x27;t worth the time to return.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love that this product is all natural</li>
      <li>I began my search for leave-ins with safe, natural ingredients that defined my curls but didn&#x27;t leave a film of chemical garbage on my hair.    </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.</li>
      <li>I avoided using most styling aids until well into my mid 20s.</li>
      <li>It even stands out among other Audrey Organics&#x27; other products that I&#x27;ve tried as the absolute best.</li>
      <li>Considering that this is a product made with aloe, vitamins, and essential oils, that is fine by me.    </li>
      <li>I like it cause I can put as much as I need.  </li>
      <li>This seems to be working really well.</li>
      <li>Really like the Aubrey Organics Hair Design Gel B5</li>
      <li>It works well, however, perhaps a coincidence, but it seems to work like &amp;#34;miracle grow&amp;#34; as to how fast his hair grows now and how often he has to get a hair cut.</li>
      <li>3.5 stars .the reason that I gave this gel a 3.5 star is because the gel is very runny.</li>
      <li>This product works reasonably well.</li>
      <li>This is a High Quality Gel.</li>
      <li>This product hold better than other natural gels I have tried.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product, esp because it is something natural I can use.</li>
      <li>This is the first entirely organic hair gel I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>but so far this is helping!</li>
      <li>You only need to use a small amount, about the size of a dime, and you get a nice natural hold.  </li>
      <li>The only problem is that I need a lot - and they don&#x27;t have a large volume discount.</li>
      <li>The smell is very strong and not exactly a good smell but the product does serve its purpose.  </li>
      <li>-- but some of the natural ones are ineffective.  </li>
      <li>This is really the only gel I use.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s thick and fine .</li>
      <li>They become so soft but at the same time defined!</li>
      <li>you want a semi strong hold this is not a good product at all.</li>
      <li>Works well on my hair, not to stiff but gives fine limp hair body.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Unfortunately in my search for corn free gel due to corn allergy this one did not work for me. I have a lot of thin hair and this gel does not provide any hold. A few minutes after using the gel it looks like I did not add anything to my hair. I have a short pixie cut and don&#x27;t need a lot of hold, but I do need some. This did not work for me.</li>
    <li> 2nd bottle. Works well on my hair, not to stiff but gives fine limp hair body.</li>
    <li> Thank you, works really well and smells nice too.  Just what I wanted!</li>
    <li> This is really the only gel I use. I never load mystery chemicals into my healthy hair. I avoided using most styling aids until well into my mid 20s. After a breakup I decided to cut my long wavy hair which resulted in its springing up into frizzy spiral curls. After using conventional styling aids I began my search for leave-ins with safe, natural ingredients that defined my curls but didn&#x27;t leave a film of chemical garbage on my hair.    My search didn&#x27;t last long, but my hair had grown out a bit before I discovered Aubrey Organics&#x27; B5 Design gel. This is the only product of any kind with which I am consistently happy. It even stands out among other Audrey Organics&#x27; other products that I&#x27;ve tried as the absolute best. I never have to rotate between this and other similar products.     This is not a gel for maximum hold or funky styles - this is more of a conditioning gel. What I like about B5 Design Gel is that it uses herbal gums to control frizz in my hair without weighing it down. I don&#x27;t have very porous hair and products have a habit of just sitting on top of my hair, but I find this product is well absorbed into my hair by the end of the day. Considering that this is a product made with aloe, vitamins, and essential oils, that is fine by me.    This is a great natural heat protector and it is also a good conditioner aside from doing a good job of defining gentler, non-coarse curls. Also, one eight ounce bottle goes a long way - I bought a second bottle to keep around when I finished the one I had - which still hasn&#x27;t happened. I even enjoy the smell of this gel, which is light and herbal.     I cannot recommend this product highly enough for those who want conditioning and frizz taming with light-to-moderate hold.</li>
    <li> I like this better than the chemical based stuff I was using. It works pretty good, I found it best to put on shortly after a shower as it seems to work better when you hair is slightly damp. The other stuff I had been using from a haircut place for years started to give my scalp some rashes and I needed something that would hold my hair and wanted something that was caustic chemical free. Only thing is it&#x27;s not as heavy of a hold gel as my other but it works well enough, so no worries.</li>
    <li> Works just like regular hair gel.  I am very happy with this product, as I did not expect an organic product to be as good as one of the regular off-the-shelf products.  I will be using this forever it seems.  Cheers.</li>
    <li> This product works reasonably well. I just wish it would last a little bit longer. Other than that its great.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing gel&#x27;y about this stuff... it&#x27;s like using scented water... no hold or styling ability whatsoever.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This gel doesn&#x27;t increase acne with daily use. Most hairgel increases acne.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve finally got my hair under control.  I don&#x27;t like to use all those standard beauty products -- do they cause cancer? -- but some of the natural ones are ineffective.  This stuff holds my hair in place and also makes it look shiny.  Great.</li>
    <li> No harsh chemicals, all natural, makes my short hair stay in place without being spiky hard. Just work into wet hair, style, done. Love it!</li>
    <li> wonderful gel. It de frizzes my hair without making it look hard and shiny. I use it every day with a blowdryer.</li>
    <li> I like it cause I can put as much as I need.  I need a light solution for my hair and this works for me.  I just want to keep static from affecting my hair and a lift where I want it.  It is organic and doesn&#x27;t affect my health negatively. It is a healthier product.  I am glad it it available!</li>
    <li> A light product on your hair , but I think it gives very good holding results.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a High Quality Gel. Organic.  It helps hold the hair in place even after it gets mushed around.</li>
    <li> I have been using Aubrey products from at least the late 1980&#x27;s. Really like the Aubrey Organics Hair Design Gel B5 All-Natural. Makes my unruly, light hair behave better. Has a nice smell too. I like that it is a combined hair conditioner and hair gel that one can apply after getting out of the shower; it does not have to be rinsed out of the hair! Saves me time...</li>
    <li> This is great stuff! I have waist length hair that&#x27;s thick and fine . This makes the best curls. It has great hold too</li>
    <li> I am white with long fine-ish blonde hair. I have moved over to all natural products in my house from cleaning supplies to hair care &amp; this gel is perfect for my hair. It is light weight &amp; perfect for me. Love using natural products!</li>
    <li> My husband switched to this because it is organic.  It works well, however, perhaps a coincidence, but it seems to work like &amp;#34;miracle grow&amp;#34; as to how fast his hair grows now and how often he has to get a hair cut.</li>
    <li> Love this pvc free gel!</li>
    <li> This product hold better than other natural gels I have tried.  The smell is very strong and not exactly a good smell but the product does serve its purpose.  Will probably buy again unless I come across something better.</li>
    <li> I got this gel for my husband and it&#x27;s just a waste of money! This gel makes your hair looks white like if you have dandruff and dry!! Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> This gel is awesome and hypoallergenic but you can buy it for $7 elsewhere!!!  $19.99 is outrageous.</li>
    <li> Good to use with long hair and not short,  doesnt leave much residue which is good but takes more amount</li>
    <li> this product has a scent</li>
    <li> This is the first entirely organic hair gel I&#x27;ve found. I&#x27;ve tried Jason&#x27;s and it was more natural than typical hair gel, but some of the ingredients were questionable. Aubrey organics has a great list of ingredients and works well.</li>
    <li> 3.5 stars .the reason that I gave this gel a 3.5 star is because the gel is very runny. However it does hold very good. It doesn&#x27;t flake up either. The reason  I decided to use organic gel is because the regular gel was making my forehead break out. This gel has not!</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Thought this product was oily and did not hold hair in place at all.  Threw it away, wasn&#x27;t worth the time to return.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a semi strong hold this is not a good product at all.</li>
    <li> i use this product everyday!&lt;br /&gt;It is the best for my curly hair; never stiff but gives good body.</li>
    <li> For my curly hair this gel is the best! They become so soft but at the same time defined! I LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> It smells even better than the ones I had before. I love this product, it&#x27;s very natural and I&#x27;ve used it for a long time. Not many stores carry it around NYC.</li>
    <li> This product really does the job for me, great ingredients, pleasant scent, good price. I love it!</li>
    <li> keeps hair soft, good hold</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  You only need to use a small amount, about the size of a dime, and you get a nice natural hold.  No plastic look, easy on your hair.  If you&#x27;re a man with really fine hair, I recommend it.  I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different products and this has become my go-to one.  I don&#x27;t like the products with wax or plastic in them.  Using this product I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair every day either, rub a little water in my hair and some gel and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> This seems to be working really well. My hair is transitioning from straight to wavy and Sumners are brutal but so far this is helping!</li>
    <li> I am a white Irish girl with the curliest hair you have ever seen - Shirley Temple locks plus plus. This gel works very well to control the curls and make them look nice. The only problem is that I need a lot - and they don&#x27;t have a large volume discount. So I have to mix it with other products to save money.</li>
    <li> Awesome Product. Its organic, which is why I went for it!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product, esp because it is something natural I can use.</li>
    <li> The best organic gel for curly or wavy hair, I have used so many HAIR GEL Organic products in the market. Let me tell you Aubery gel b5 does the job, I wish I had discover it sooner.</li>
    <li> Not worth 11 dollars. more like 4.99.</li>
    <li> I love that this product is all natural but I do not like the smell! It stinks and I am in the process of trying to figure out perhaps another finishing product that will smell good! It means a lot to me if my hair stinks. This doesn&#x27;t help that pet peeve. Other than that, it holds well and does what it says! I haven&#x27;t had the white residue problem like others but I don&#x27;t cake this stuff in my hair. I would recommend it with another smell good product. :)</li>
    <li> The gel is good but I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and have a really hard time finding hair products that work.  When I first used this I thought it was going to be a nightmare because the texture was a bit watery and the smell was HORRIBLE but I was wrong!!!  I haven&#x27;t had a bad hair day since I started using this product over a month ago.  The smell is bad and strong at first but I promise you that after about 5 or 10 mins the smell goes away and everything looks great</li>
    <li> My favorite hair gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years. Usually buy it at whole foods, but they stopped carrying it. Thank you Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally curly hair, this gel is great. It keeps control of the frizzies, without weighing my hair down or making it look wet and feel crunchy. A little goes a long way. Also, not a lot of unwanted chemicals, and no animal testing! I definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over twenty-five years. It leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable. There&#x27;s never any residue build-up. I have curly/wavy hair. I think B5 Design Gel is excellent for all hair types.</li>
