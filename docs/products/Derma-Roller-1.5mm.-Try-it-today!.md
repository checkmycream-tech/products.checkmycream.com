<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product makes your skin feel and look good.  Smooth&#x27;s out wrinkles and improves imperfects such as  dark spots. Works great need to try it can&#x27;t go wrong especially with there money back guarantee</li>
    <li> I love this derma roller! My skin has improved drastically. My fine lines have begun to disappear and my deeper lines are much smaller. I literally feel my pours shrinking more &amp; more each day! I am very impressed with this results. It&#x27;s easy to use and I can tell that it enhances the effectiveness of the serum I use. I highly recommended this! Thanks a bunch!</li>
    <li> I saw this at my mom&#x27;s place once and knew I had to get my hands on it! And since using it, I am not sorry for one single moment. After the first use, my skin felt softer, looked younger, and my acne scars seriously started disappearing. I am still using the product and see new results that satisfy my every single day. I definitely recommend this product above all creams and ointments out there.</li>
    <li> As I have been getting a bit older with age, my skin has changed and become more sensitive. I began noticing more break outs, not a lot, but enough. I have been using this for a few weeks now and I am noticing the difference in my skin, a big improvement in the appearance. I have been having fewer break outs and I look younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> While I am still young, my mother and I frequently discuss the new products that we have either tried or heard about from others. While visiting home she told me about this one. Apparently one of her friends brought this around during one of their beauty parties (like a Tupperware party, except with makeup and products). She got one for herself, and I do have to say that it has helped her look quite a bit younger, even though I&#x27;d say that she already looks quite good for 49. Naturally, upon returning home I bought one for myself and decided to try it out. Like I said, I&#x27;m still young. That being said, I am huge fan of the price, the simplicity of the roller, and I am positive that I can already see some results! Ba da ba ba ba! I&#x27;m lovin it!</li>
    <li> Tons of information online on dermarolling, needling, \\&quot;collagen induction therapy\\&quot;. The \\&quot;at-home\\&quot; rollers with short needles (.15mm, .25mm, sometimes .50mm) are recommended to enhance productivity of your serums - drives them in deeper. These can be used several times per week. Usage of the more professional sizes (to treat wrinkles &amp; scarring), with needles measuring 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, is recommended to be spaced two to three weeks apart. The roller is comprised of a series of fine needles which are used to puncture the skin and cause wounds and inflammation, which stimulates the body&#x27;s own production of collagen. According to the makers of these instruments, results can take three to nine months to fully appear as the body takes time to generate new collagen. I use a .25mm to drive in products, and a couple of times have tried the 2.0mm for more intense treatment. I&#x27;ve had no adverse reaction, and have actually noticed that my facial skin is thicker and firmer. Some gals like to use a topical anesthetic for the 2.0mm treatments, but I have not found it necessary. If interested in trying, please ladies, do your research!</li>
    <li> Miracle Titanium Dermaroller Microneedle Skin Care System For Men &amp; Women + FREE Travel Case by Hermosa Naturals: Increase your Circulation and Look Younger with Dermaroller Skin Care System    Hermosa Naturals was introduced to me by one of my blog followers via social media. I love social media for this reason, I find the best gems and treasures. The Hermosa Naturals Miracle Titanium Dermaroller MicroNeedle Skin Care System is a smart, savvy, and simple way to increase your circulation in your skin (roll out cellulite, imperfections, ripples, dark spots) and makes the skin look younger! It also makes the skin so soft. With increased circulation, your skin is better oxygenated and better nourished. Nutrients are able to access the skin cells better, metabolize better, naturally making the skin appear more youthful. It also buffs the skin, give you a healthy and vibrant glow.    The concept reminds me of eastern medicine and beauty practices, similar to Ayurveda. They practice exfoliating and circulation techniques in eastern medicine and beauty regimens because they are aware that doing so improves the skins color, texture, flow, and glow. I&#x27;m so happy I had the opportunity to try such a brilliant product and share my experience with others. I also adore the travel case. The case makes it easy to bring the roller along on trips and to my spa appointments (should I wish to share it with the estheticians). Can&#x27;t keep quiet too long about a good thing.    Manja!

    <li> I have to admit I was a bit skeptical at first, but this is the BEST skin treatment I have used in a long time! It&#x27;s only been a few weeks but I am already noticing a dramatic change in my skin. Getting older doesn&#x27;t have to mean chemicals ladies! My fiance has even notices a change that has been great for us! The lines under my eyes are going away and my cheeks seem to have raised! I would absolutely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Time has a way of weathering the skin in so many ways. Being a equestrian rider I know just how much damage the sun and elements can do to your skin.  My mother bought this product for me to try and I fell in love with it. In under a few weeks my skin looks not only heathier, but feels softer, and the lines are beginning to slowly disappear. I believe everyone should have a derma roller! My skin alone has improved drastically and I&#x27;m even getting others noticeing as well. I pratically feel my pours shrinking more with each use. I am very impressed with this results and think everyone should try it out.  It&#x27;s easy to use and simple to maintain. The best thing I have ever tried. AMAZING PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t look or think about any other product after using this one. Most successful product I&#x27;ve used. No other product showed this results and can&#x27;t compare.</li>
    <li> The anti-aging derma roller by Hermosa Naturals can serve a diverse demographic. This is because the product is universally adaptive to any race or gender. This device works wonderful to smooth out those lines and hide those wrinkles, while being gentle on your skin. Combined with some of the various facial products and cleansers, this device can work wonders. The anti-aging derma roller can help anyone firm yet soften their skin and do so effortlessly. The travel case is a great addition because it allows you to take the tool with you anywhere you go, providing it with safe storage and ergonomic stowing. I recommend this tool to anyone who wishes to maintain or improve their skin.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using the Derma Roller from Hermosa Naturals for a few weeks now, and really loves it. She really feels the difference compared to others. Highly recommended. My wife likes using products that make her feel comfortable and relaxed. With researching online, we are glad we made the right choice to go with the Derma Roller. When I take a look at my wife she looks healthier and looks younger. This is a A+ product in my opinion.  The one I have is white, but I plan on buying the black one as well. If your looking to get a gift for someone then I really recommend this before anything else. The Derma Roller Skin Care System by Hermosa Naturals can help remove your wrinkles, cellulite, dark circles, stretch marks, scars, big pores, crows feet and more! What are you waiting for? Stop reading and buy 2.</li>
    <li> At the age of 35, I was looking for something that didn&#x27;t require much work and this definitely fit the bill.  Wasn&#x27;t to sure how the titanium would feel on my face, but it&#x27;s quite nice, leaving a healing sensation.  Easy to handle and no mess!  I was able to diminish not only the dark circles around my eyes, but it&#x27;s starting to remove the wrinkles on the outer parts of my eyes as well. I have even started using it on my hands and find that I am not needing a paraffin wrap from the nail shop as often.  I am definitely happy with my purchase...no clean-up, no chemicals, no mask to wear and the best part about it is I can take it with me wherever I go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t expect much for the price, but will share this with others I know.  This is definitely going in the stockings this coming holiday season!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my stretch marks, they&#x27;re really bad from weight-loss and weight-gain, and I started using it immediately and started seeing results immediately as well. I can&#x27;t even believe it worked! I thought it was going to hurt and not work, but it was almost painless, and it showed results straight away. I&#x27;m going to keep on using this for a very long time!</li>
    <li> I tried this product because I&#x27;m sick of my crows feet. It makes me look older than I really am. I can&#x27;t believe my crows feet are gone and my skin looks beautiful like I haven&#x27;t been smoking for twenty years!!!</li>
    <li> *Ladies and Gentleman*,&lt;br /&gt;Today was not just any other day. Today, I fell in love with an a stunning new product. Just recieved my dermarollar! I Love This Titanium WONDER!

    <li> I actually turned 40 at the beginning of in April. Like most women I had let my skin care routine slide and when I looked in the bathroom mirror I was horrified to see the wrinkles, and also uneven skin tones. I immediately went on the Internet and began doing some research and came across this product The Hermosa Naturals Derma Roller Skin Care System. I bought it immediately because it inexpensive and had some good reviews. I have now been using it for two months and after some effort of using with my usual moisturizer I have noticed a considerable amount of firming up of the skin around the jaw-line and eye areas. I apply the moisturizer with the Miracle Derma Roller System and find that it really works in well firming and toning the facial skin. If you are anything like me I am always a bit impatient to see results so I use the roller twice a day and can see a certain amount of uplift to the facial skin because it seems to boost collagen levels in the skin, making you look younger.</li>
    <li> The derma roller has made my skin look younger. No more dark spots and my skin feels soft. Was afraid to use at first but it didn&#x27;t even hurt. Will definitely be recommending this product to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it and look many years younger. It is great with my anti aging products and it is absorbed into my skin.</li>
    <li> Fai ally I feel like I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s again. I&#x27;ve been using this product for months now and I can&#x27;t complain, this is one of the best investments that I&#x27;ve made. I tried using other beauty products but this stands out, my skin feels softer and it&#x27;s also reduced some pores I had. I hade some Acane scars and I&#x27;m so excited that they are fading away.  For anyone looking for a way to look younger I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin and have to be very careful about what I use on my skin, but as I get older, wrinkles and cellulite are continuously becoming of increasing concern. I was so happy to find the Hermosa Naturals Anti-aging Derma Roller. It&#x27;s gentle enough for my sensitive skin and my skin looks years younger without expensive and abrasive topical products. Perfect in every way!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my birthday last month. At first I was skeptical because all the flaws on my skin was quite distinguishable and I often have trouble with covering it up with make-up. I tried it for the first couple weeks not expecting to see any immediate results, but to my surprise, I noticed my scars were fading!!! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I tried coco butter and a bunch of so called remedies and never had the results like this. And the big indicator was when my sister asked to borrow it and I never received it back. Will definitely recommend this derma roller to anyone who looking to naturally reduce skin imperfections. I won&#x27;t get into any more details but it is well worth it for the value and the results.</li>
    <li> When I first saw the Titanium Dermaroller, I was a little leary based on how it looked. All the reviews were awesome, so I gave it a try. All I can say is, &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34;! My face is smoother, more toned and the spots that were starting to creep in were taken care of too! All without using different skin care products. I am purchasing another one to use for my body....cellulite, be gone!</li>
    <li> http://www.amazon.com/Selling-Titanium-Dermatology-Hermosa-Naturals/dp/B00IZ0D2VQ/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1396784414&amp;sr&#x3D;8-3&amp;keywords&#x3D;derma+roller  It made my skin feel soft and supple.  It was very easy to use also!  My skin tone is even, yes!!!</li>
    <li> I just had my first baby a few months ago! And I wondered how I was going to get rid of these stretch marks and all the cellulite I&#x27;ve accumulated. So, I did some research and came across this Titanium Dermaroller. I read about it and thought it was worth a shot. Best investment I&#x27;ve made to get my body looking back to normal! And it&#x27;s so easy to use!!</li>
    <li> The derma roller from Hermosa Naturals is exactly what the ad says it is-“The Best Selling Anti-Aging Derma Roller.  My wife was trying to urge me to by the derma roller for both of us.  At first I was very reluctant because I figured it was for women.  So I finally gave in and purchased two.  When we got them we ended up having two different colors.  A black one for me and a pink one for my wife.  The free travel case was cool and needed.  The derma roller lives up to its reputation as being the number one choice for professionals and the stars of Hollywood. As we used the derma roller we noticed a dramatic change in our skin.  We noticed that the dark marks from wearing glasses were disappearing, a lot of our scars that we had since childhood had virtually disappeared.  Not to mention old acne scars totally vanishing. Our skin looks brilliant and we feel and look like “A-Listers“.  This is an amazing product that everybody should get.  My wife and I do not regret the purchase not one bit.</li>
    <li> It is every women’s right to lie about her age, but turning 40 really shocked me. Mother nature is not kind and I began to notice wrinkles and lines in my creases on my face. I turned to this product never thinking that the claims would be very effective but tried it anyway, and to my surprise I am beginning to look younger as the wrinkles and lines start fading away. Every day it does a little more, I can’t wait to see what I look like in a few months. I was scared a week ago, thinking I would only look worse as my life progressed, but with this product I am no longer worried, and I am actually looking forward to my looks in the near future. I have already recommended it to my entire family.</li>
    <li> I had no idea I was going to get the results that I did from this product but my god, it is amazing. I recooodmend it to all of my friends whenever it has a chance to come up in conversation. Check this out, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was so surprised how good it works. From the pic, it looked like it could be painful but its actually gentle. It gets rid of those wrinkles and smoothes out those problem areas. If you ever wanted to try a derma roller, this is the product for you. I&#x27;m big on beauty because I do makeup and so the skin is something that I pay especially close attention to. My mom&#x27;s skin is turning over a new leaf and renewing youth. Makes a great mothers day gift if you get overnight shipping. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I was sckeptical in the beginning, I must say,I have paid for treatments and I will say this product helps me save money.The treatments cost 100 dollars and dont last very long,with this product i can renew my skin anytime,anywhere.I especially like to use it before outings in the evening,and I have a class reunion comimg up and this will definately come in handy for that. I used to believe in creams to fix my problems but you have to remove dead layers of skin and physically remove blockage in pores on a micro-level to see results, Don&#x27;t fall for magic creams do something that is making a physical differance to your skin. I would reccomend trying this derma roller before i took a risk on products that you cant even understand the science behind,as I did. I wasted alot of money on other products that didn&#x27;t work and it&#x27;s nice to find something that does without relying on an esthetician.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this works as well as it does. I was skeptical at first but after a friend recommended it to me and showed me her results, I had to try it out for myself. So easy to use and my skin has never looked better. If I ever lose it, I&#x27;m definitely buying another.</li>
    <li> As someone with pale, prone-to-wrinkly skin, this tool is the BEST! I love everything about it- the rolling is both invigorating and relaxing simultaneously. Great for increased blood flow, which helps the skin to appear younger and less aged. Love it!</li>
    <li> But I did! My skin was looking younger in weeks. Even my boyfriend noticed! I loved everything about this product and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone looking for younger skin. I&#x27;ve tried everything from olay to mary kay and this by far works the best.</li>
    <li> Good value for your money, this gadget. Skin exfoliated, absorbs healthful products more readily. After using using this a few itmes, my face is more clear and fresh-looking.</li>
    <li> I used this titanium roller skin care product, not really expecting much.  After a week of using it, I feel it really made my skin look younger.  It is an interesting device, as it is deceiving how effective it on revitalizing skin.  I have recommended it to some of my friends as it really works well.  It is a great natural alternative to going to see a dermatologist. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical of using this product however I placed an order. Received the product extremely fast and have been satisfied with its performance. Never before has my face been so smooth. I had many issues with Dark Circles under my eyes and have found that it has almost completely gotten rid of them since using it. I highly recommend trying out this product! Get it as quick as you can.</li>
    <li> I have to admit this product did look to be suspect at first. But after using this product after a couple of days I really did notice that my skin was more smoother and just absolutely brilliant complexion. Not only does this product make me feel good but it also makes me feel like a teenager again.</li>
    <li> It adds color to your face and stimulates the blood flow.  It&#x27;s a mini-massager for your skin.  It&#x27;s very useful when you&#x27;re looking pale</li>
    <li> The derma roller has made my skin look younger. No more dark spots and my skin feels soft. Was afraid to use at first but it didn&#x27;t even hurt. Will definitely be recommending this product to friends and family.</li>
    <li> This device works wonderful to smooth out those lines and hide those wrinkles, while being gentle on your skin. Combined with some of the various facial products and cleansers, this device can work wonders. The anti-aging derma roller can help anyone firm yet soften their skin and do so effortlessly. The travel case is a great addition because it allows you to take the tool with you anywhere you go, providing it with safe storage and ergonomic stowing. I recommend this tool to anyone who wishes to maintain or improve their skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this now for a while and keep coming back to it over the other products and creams I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m not sure how it works, but this thing has pretty much eliminated the fine lines under my eyes, and noticeably softened my crow&#x27;s feet. It didn&#x27;t even give me acne. I already had some acne on my chin and I think this actually helped. A true miracle product! My fiance even uses it and I can tell he likes it because he looks younger. At first he was skeptical but now he likes it.</li>
    <li> Soo I am not going to lie a product like this seemed too good to be true! I have always had a problem with stretch marks and cellulite since I was a teenager and I tried numerous products to help reduce/fade them. But nothing has worked quite like this Derma Roller. One of my co-workers actually recommended it to me and I thought why not?! I am glad I did! I&#x27;ve been using this product and have seen great results. My stretch marks are on my lower hip area and not too visible unless I&#x27;m in a bathing suit. I always wear a wrap or something to disguise them. Derma Roll from Hermosa Naturals has faded them greatly with a little bit of patience and NO CHEMICALS which is what I love most! I really do recommend that you try it especially if you&#x27;ve tried all the magic creams this a simple easy way to treat a host of skin issues that occur inevitably as we age as woman! You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Beware of the reviews, there are not &amp;#34;customer verified&amp;#34;. It seems very suspicious to me. Check twice before buying this product!</li>
    <li> I have been self conscious about my eyes for years. I had a ton of wrinkles underneath them and crows feet. I also almost always had  bags under my eyes. All of this made it hard for me to smile with confidence. My friend told me about this product after I asked her how she looks so young and perfect. I have used this for a few months and absolutely love the results! My eyes have improved so much that even my mom who never gives compliments said I am looking a lot better. I notice my under eye bags have disappeared and my lines have gotten more shallow. I am so happy that I have found something that actually works without having cosmetic surgery!</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it&#x27;s real easy to use . Id definitely Buy it again . VERY SATISFIED CUSTOMER .</li>
    <li> I saw this product advertised right before the holidays and I thought it would be a great gift for my grandma. She has been using it for a few months now and really loves it. Her skin looks much tighter and feels very soft. She uses it as directed and has been very consistent with keeping at it. I think this is the secret that most people don’t take seriously. You must be consistent with something in order to see results, just like anything else. Consistency is key and all the efforts you put in to use the product as directed will prove that. This product really lives up to its expectations. This product was great for my idea of gift giving for over the holidays and after trying the product, my grandma really thanked me for getting it for her. I am very happy with my purchase and recommend it to anyone looking to better their skin.</li>
    <li> Great product. I bought this for my mom and she let me use it as well. And I was very happy with it. I&#x27;ll definitely recommend the product to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Derma Roller for a few months now, and I will say that it is great. After a few weeks I could really tell the difference in my skin, with dark spots and stretch marks fading. I would recommend it to anyone looking to improve skin imperfections!</li>
    <li> I had never heard of a physical tool that would help improve the quality of my skin, I&#x27;ve always tried creams etc....but since I started using this product I can definitely tell a visible difference, it definitely helps me preserve a more youthful look than past treatments.</li>
    <li> I love it!  It makes my skin look so great, I feel so much younger, and it&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of this product at first as I have tried out dozens of other acne scar remedies, but this product really works!  Within just a few days the appearance of my acne scars disappeared and my skin looks and feels better than it has in years.</li>
    <li> I am a dermal roller trainer and totally agree with The reviewer before me who gave an excellent explanation of transdermal needling and whether this is effective on stretch marks or not.&lt;br /&gt;A 1mm needle will not get you the results on your stretch marks but will allow deeper absorption of the product being applied immediately after needling.&lt;br /&gt;A 2-3 mm needle is required though a 1.5 mm needle can be used for stretch marks. You really should have this done in a insured clinic or salon, I do however recommend this product with a 2mm roller and treating yourself at home.</li>
    <li> really helped me.i love it.will order again.i feel so renewed inside and out.thank goodness for this item.with daily use it helps.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my mother because she is really into cosmetics and she loves to keep her skin looking nice and refreshing. she&#x27;s been getting older recently and we can see that she has been dealing with the turmoil of getting wrinkles, creases, and the typical baggage under her eye. I was worried about her because I knew it would hit her hard. Sure the creams and other items would help but I knew there had to be something out there that could help her out. I heard of this product on a whim from a friend who said the results where great. I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. After a few weeks my mom was seeing results and I couldn&#x27;t be any happier for her! The creases and baggage where gone and now the wrinkles are starting to fade!! I would recommend this product from Hermosa Naturals, it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
