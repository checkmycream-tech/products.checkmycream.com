### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>On the plus side, this product provides excellent coverage of my gray roots between colorings.</li>
      <li>This is the best product on the market for covering gray roots between colorings.  </li>
      <li>If you are balding, this may be the perfect product for you as it does color your scalp.  </li>
      <li>This is the perfect gray cover between salon visits.  </li>
      <li>Bumble and Bumble great products!!!</li>
      <li>Bumble and Bumble color sprays are a great alternative to temporary dye.  </li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>you don&#x27;t want to be wearing good clothes when you use the product.  </li>
      <li>like applying any kind of hair color</li>
      <li>This product is amazing - it really does a great job of covering up areas with light hair coverage.  </li>
      <li>I will use this product for the top of my head.</li>
      <li>and I love it for myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maria G.</li>
      <li>Needs a more accurate nozzle!</li>
      <li>This product is wonderful if you use it only for covering gray roots in an emergency situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>love this and recommend it to all who are or having thinning hair and want your scalp to look as though you did not lose your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>love this product.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it would be ok if you applied it to an updo and didn&#x27;t even think about touching your hair all night.</li>
      <li>I was attending and the hostess asked if I had been touching dirt.</li>
      <li>I was pleased because it immediately took care of the oiliness.</li>
      <li>I use a tissue to lightly rub any scalp that is prominently exposed</li>
      <li>WAKE UP B&amp;B and equip your bottle with a fine tuned nozzle.</li>
      <li>This is a great color, but only for the areas away from your face.</li>
      <li>STYLE EDIT has the PERFECT tiny nozzle to get near the outline of your face.</li>
      <li>I practiced to be able to spray it lightly and at an angle, and it works for me (any powder or crayon or mascara type products I tried either didn&#x27;t cover or didn&#x27;t adhere to my hair very well).</li>
      <li>This is a good travel size and lasts about two months--a large bottle like the 4 ounce size will last 6 months or more.</li>
      <li>The picture shows a full size product, I received the size of a sample.  </li>
      <li>I put the can VERY CLOSE to my scalp (almost touching) and spray spurts in spots to just cover the gray that shows - like where a part is.</li>
      <li>Not a bad product for covering greys</li>
      <li>I am sure it will look more obvious than if you get a close match.</li>
      <li>However, I was quickly displeased when I arrived at the party</li>
      <li>and you need a quick \\&quot;cover the gray\\</li>
      <li>I do love this particular color though...</li>
      <li>While my hair grows back in, this amazing powder gives one the illusion of a full head of hair with a quick spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It will look more natural that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>Worth the time and money to find when you can&#x27;t get to the hairdresser and your roots are sticking out.</li>
      <li>When I first sprayed the product on my hair</li>
      <li>Will read the description more closely next time.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use a lot of hair products so this might be obvious to others, but watch out when you use it - don&#x27;t wear light clothing and don&#x27;t spray it near light colored fabrics, because it&#x27;ll stain.</li>
      <li>It seems like this product is more for covering grey hair.</li>
      <li>What a mistake, saw the the large bottle and thought that was what I was buying.</li>
      <li>The brown spray colors her scalp and makes her hair appear much thicker than it is.  </li>
      <li>but I would rather not use it much.</li>
      <li>She had been disheartened by how much scalp shows through her hair, and this has remedied that for her.  </li>
      <li>I gave it four stars instead of five because the pigment is pretty intense, so if you get any on your clothes, fingers, (or the porous interior of an older bathtub when you wash your hair), you have to be careful to remove it quickly or it may stain.</li>
      <li>This dry shampoo works more like spray paint than powder, leaving my hair dull and crunchy (like I&#x27;ve dipped my head in a vat of cheap hair spray).</li>
      <li>I spent the rest of the party making trips to the bathroom to clean my &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; forehead.</li>
      <li>If your hair style only shows a small area of exposed gray then I think you will love and appreciate this product for those days when you really should color your hair but just don&#x27;t have time.</li>
      <li>So much easier to fix the back of my hair.</li>
      <li>I know it&#x27;s pricey but worth it and last a long time.</li>
      <li>What a HUGE waste of money!  </li>
      <li>Great for covering gray roots - small can lasts me 6 months - a little goes a long way!</li>
      <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s a new product on the market avaialble at drugstores; in the future I will purchase that instead</li>
      <li>Maybe the white powder is better, at least with respect to staining.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly like any other hair spray...</li>
      <li>I use just a tine spray on the colic and it covers up what looks like a bare spot.  </li>
      <li>good product but very expensive.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is amazing - it really does a great job of covering up areas with light hair coverage.  Doesn&#x27;t run and washes out neatly!  Would recommend to anyone dealing with hair loss, thinning hair or hair just growing back in!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use a lot of hair products so this might be obvious to others, but watch out when you use it - don&#x27;t wear light clothing and don&#x27;t spray it near light colored fabrics, because it&#x27;ll stain. I didn&#x27;t really notice an increase in volume or greasiness, either, and it&#x27;s not cheap. Maybe the white powder is better, at least with respect to staining.</li>
    <li> Needs a more accurate nozzle! Ugh! I bought this from my stylist to cover gray in between appointments. I like the color, but there is not fine tuned &amp;#34;spout&amp;#34; or nozzle so that you can cover up the grays around your face. It&#x27;s exactly like any other hair spray...wide... I tried to cover my temples and forehead line but it ended up ALL OVER MY FACE!! There is NO WAY to pin point this spray!! WAKE UP B&amp;B and equip your bottle with a fine tuned nozzle. This is a great color, but only for the areas away from your face. STYLE EDIT has the PERFECT tiny nozzle to get near the outline of your face. I will use this product for the top of my head. It&#x27;s also STICKIER than Style Edit...again...just like hair spray... I do love this particular color though...it&#x27;s perfect...but the texture and HUGE SPRAY PATTERN make it impossible to recommend. : /</li>
    <li> Bumble and Bumble great products!!! But the bottle drips all over, floor, sink and my face. Love the product HATED the spray nozzle.....</li>
    <li> Now that I look back at the order, it does say 1 oz. - but the picture is a 4.4 oz. can (which I have used before).  I was shocked when I received this tiny can that looks nothing like this picture.  I have previously ordered this product elsewhere and paid about the same price for the larger can.  I am very disappointed with this pricing.  An address of Beauty Supply Center, 1036 S Holt Ave., Unit 6, Los Angeles, CA 90035 was the return address - I could not find this on the Internet.  They did not include a phone number for me to call them with complaints.</li>
    <li> This product works well to cover gray in your part area. However, it seems way overpriced for how small the can.</li>
    <li> Great for covering gray roots - small can lasts me 6 months - a little goes a long way! Does have off texture but I only use it between colorings to cover gray</li>
    <li> good product but very expensive.  I purchased it online--unavailable locally.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a new product on the market avaialble at drugstores; in the future I will purchase that instead</li>
    <li> I have a colic on the back of my head.  It makes my part split and I have a hard time covering it up.  I use just a tine spray on the colic and it covers up what looks like a bare spot.  So much easier to fix the back of my hair.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t do it! This is the worst dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried. When I first sprayed the product on my hair I was pleased because it immediately took care of the oiliness. However, I was quickly displeased when I arrived at the party I was attending and the hostess asked if I had been touching dirt. What the heck? There was brown dye all over my forehead and fingertips. Even after I wiped it off (with soap and water) every time my hair touched my forehead it would leave its brown mark. I spent the rest of the party making trips to the bathroom to clean my &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; forehead. Maybe it would be ok if you applied it to an updo and didn&#x27;t even think about touching your hair all night. Overall, very disappointing.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend.  I can see why hairdressers don&#x27;t recommend as it saved me from moving up my appointment.  love this product.  Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> It shows a big bottle but i received a tiny sample so misleading. I got ripped off and feel i was cheated</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo works more like spray paint than powder, leaving my hair dull and crunchy (like I&#x27;ve dipped my head in a vat of cheap hair spray). I was terribly disappointed, especially considering how much I love other Bumble and Bumble products.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful if you use it only for covering gray roots in an emergency situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT use it like hair spray. I put the can VERY CLOSE to my scalp (almost touching) and spray spurts in spots to just cover the gray that shows - like where a part is. I use a tissue to lightly rub any scalp that is prominently exposed so it is not colored and leave it on the hair.  It will look more natural that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like applying any kind of hair color you don&#x27;t want to be wearing good clothes when you use the product.  If your hair style only shows a small area of exposed gray then I think you will love and appreciate this product for those days when you really should color your hair but just don&#x27;t have time.</li>
    <li> Matched my hair perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply, just keep your fingers out of your hair after applying.&lt;br /&gt;Would order again.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect gray cover between salon visits.  Only thing, it wears off to the touch, so you have to be careful when scratching your head!</li>
    <li> for those times in between hair color and you need a quick \\&quot;cover the gray\\&quot; - I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite a number of years.  Oh, a little goes a long way...I know it&#x27;s pricey but worth it and last a long time.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this product to use in between appointments to hide the gray roots.  I used it once and found it to be very messy; it dripped onto my hands.  After one use I read the ingredients and found that this is a toxic product, different from the hair color I regularly use.  I gave it to my hairdresser!</li>
    <li> The picture shows a full size product, I received the size of a sample.  The product itself is not up to my expectation as I was looking for a dry shampoo. It seems like this product is more for covering grey hair. I tried returning it as soon as I received it but Amazon did not let me because it&#x27;s a pressurized bottle...very weird. Oh well.</li>
    <li> Covers grey we&#x27;ll but is messy and feels artificial. Not a bad product for covering greys but I would rather not use it much.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at my salon for $36 to cover gray between appointments.  What a HUGE waste of money!  It&#x27;s terribly messy and hard to control.  It covers.....however, your hair will be untouchable.  It will feel, hard, stiff and it will look dull, dull, dull.  If you are balding, this may be the perfect product for you as it does color your scalp.  I can&#x27;t imagine any other reason to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mother whose hair is very thin.  She had been disheartened by how much scalp shows through her hair, and this has remedied that for her.  The brown spray colors her scalp and makes her hair appear much thicker than it is.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This is the best product on the market for covering gray roots between colorings.  Nothing compares.</li>
    <li> On the plus side, this product provides excellent coverage of my gray roots between colorings. I have a friend who is experiencing some hereditary hair thinning and she uses the blonde color on her scalp for a bit of camouflage. A little bit goes a long way. I practiced to be able to spray it lightly and at an angle, and it works for me (any powder or crayon or mascara type products I tried either didn&#x27;t cover or didn&#x27;t adhere to my hair very well). The down side is that is a matte finish, and if it doesn&#x27;t match your hair color closely I am sure it will look more obvious than if you get a close match. I gave it four stars instead of five because the pigment is pretty intense, so if you get any on your clothes, fingers, (or the porous interior of an older bathtub when you wash your hair), you have to be careful to remove it quickly or it may stain. This is a good travel size and lasts about two months--a large bottle like the 4 ounce size will last 6 months or more.</li>
    <li> Bumble and Bumble color sprays are a great alternative to temporary dye.  Worth the time and money to find when you can&#x27;t get to the hairdresser and your roots are sticking out.</li>
    <li> I had lost my hair in spots due to vitamin malabsorption.  While my hair grows back in, this amazing powder gives one the illusion of a full head of hair with a quick spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this and recommend it to all who are or having thinning hair and want your scalp to look as though you did not lose your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am totally recommending this and I love it for myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maria G.</li>
    <li> Way too messy and expensive!</li>
    <li> What a mistake, saw the the large bottle and thought that was what I was buying. MISTAKE. It was the tinniest little bottle ever for alot of money. Will read the description more closely next time. What a ripoff</li>
    <li> This is not what I expected and there was no information about this product or directions on how to use it.</li>
