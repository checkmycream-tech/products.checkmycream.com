      <li>Pleased with results.</li>
      <li>I have to say I really love this product.</li>
      <li>I used it for more than a month and nothing has changed.</li>
      <li>I had some time to kill after work, and my curiosity got the better of me.</li>
      <li>Best of all, it only costs $1!</li>
      <li>I had one on my right cheek, a cluster of four on my forehead, and another cluster of 4 on the very top of my forehead, just under my hairline.</li>

      <li>Full review soon on my YouTube channel: xolaurieox</li>
      <li>I absolute love this product.</li>
      <li>This works better than products that cost more than double the price.</li>
      <li>Maybe if you have mild acne it would probably work.</li>
      <li>Always, always, ALWAYS start with a clean face at the beginning of treatment and moisturize either right before you zit-zap or right after.</li>
      <li>It canbe used on even the most sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Dries all my breakouts right up.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had this more than a couple of weeks but as far as I can tell, this really does work.</li>
      <li>St. Ives Blemish &amp; Blackhead Control Apricot Scrub, 6 oz]], &amp; while its done a great job at reducing my acne overall, it hasn&#x27;t disappeared entirely.</li>
      <li>I use this roll-on applier over my entire t-zone because it truly shrinks pores better than any scrub or toner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>First off, let me say that I am not at all acne prone.</li>
      <li>Truthfully, for only $1 you cannot beat the quality.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is the first E.L.F. product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I hope I don&#x27;t get any more whiteheads, but if I do, I will definitely use this product again.</li>
      <li>I tried Clean and Clear Acne Spot Treatment (salicylic acid)</li>
      <li>I actually like this, though, because you don&#x27;t have to worry about losing or wasting any product like most applier that squeeze or squirt too much out at a time.</li>
      <li>I use this product and within 2 days my zit is gone, great price with the same active ingredients as the higher priced products.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the roller ball packaging as it doesn&#x27;t seem very hygienic to me</li>
      <li>Much cheaper there.</li>
      <li>It really works for me.</li>
      <li>gets rid of zits really fast</li>
      <li>skin tolerates this product really well.</li>
      <li>This makes them much easier to conceal using [</li>
      <li>Doesnt really work, my acne didnt get any better like i expected but were ever else the product touches</li>
      <li>I think it will take only one or two more treatments before they are gone completely.</li>
      <li>other very important tip:</li>
      <li>Okay, so this produce smells very \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; but that alone still doesn&#x27;t make this any less than a 5 star product.</li>
      <li>First, I completely remove my makeup.</li>
      <li>I have mild acne and breakouts, but after using these a couple of times a day with my other face wash products my acne has cleared up pretty well!</li>
      <li>My skin is extremely sensitive and very allergy-prone.</li>
      <li>I mentioned earlier, I only rarely get pimples, so I can&#x27;t really comment on how it works for that.</li>
      <li>But a couple months ago, I developed some pretty big whiteheads.</li>
      <li>On larger zits, it takes about two days to fully smooth out, but the size it reduced in a single day.</li>
      <li>not sure if that&#x27;s happening as much as I&#x27;d like, but it&#x27;s worth a shot!</li>
      <li>Even after the major treatments and even &amp;#34;growing out of&amp;#34; acne to some extent, I am still, at 25 years old, highly prone to break outs and my skin never really seems clear or fresh looking.</li>
      <li>It dries clear, so no one even knows I have it</li>
      <li>The Clean and Clear Acne Spot Treatment caused a slight burning sensation.</li>
      <li>I have to use a couple times but it makes the acne disappear completely after a couple days</li>
      <li>The cluster of whiteheads just below my hairline is almost completely gone.</li>
      <li>Or buy on amazon if there isn&#x27;t a store near you.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had ANY problems at all as far as irritation or allergic reactions.</li>
      <li>With Salicylic acid to slough off dead skin cells and promote skin cell renewal as well as witch hazel to sooth the skin and tea tree oil to act as a natural anti-bacterial agent and skin soother, this product has powerful blemish fighting ingredients that work in harmony to banish those blemishes!</li>
      <li>I tried several different products to try to get rid of the whiteheads, but nothing really worked.</li>
      <li>This blemish stick WORKS like no other spot treatment I have ever used.</li>
      <li>The only problem with the roller is that only a small amount comes out so you really do have to roll the applier over your face or spots several time to get the right amount of solution onto your skin.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t do much to shrink my whiteheads, but it definitely caused the surrounding skin to become very dry and flaky.</li>
      <li>At the time they developed, I was trying various different drugstore foundations.</li>
      <li>But like I said earlier, I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for all-over, chronic, major acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I ice the spot on and off to reduce swelling (SUPER important with those painful swollen red bumps, especially if they throb and ache) and when I take the ice off, I saturate it with this stuff.</li>

<li> neither black nor white headed) bumps on my forehead and by my nose.</li>
<li> My only (minor) complaint is that is does smell a little musky, due to the different herbal oils, but you really can&#x27;t notice it after a few minutes!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve found that for the really troublesum blemishes that applying through out the day has dramatic results.</li>
<li> This is my Holy Grail product because it will get rid of small about-to-surface pimples over night and white heads are cleared overnight, too.</li>
<li> Those suckers would last weeks.</li>
<li> and I have found that even makeup that usually breaks me out won&#x27;t cause me any problems so long as I wear this underneath.</li>
<li> I mean it came out a little bit only, but after using a while, it stop coming out.</li>
<li> I carry my Zit Zapper with me everyday.</li>
<li> But I had quite a few whiteheads.</li>
<li> It hasn&#x27;t really dried my face out either</li>
<li> what little acne I have on my face!</li>
<li> I have taken out a giant zit in a single day, which used to be impossible for me.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure which one.</li>

    <li> Okay, so this produce smells very \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; but that alone still doesn&#x27;t make this any less than a 5 star product. Truthfully, for only $1 you cannot beat the quality. This blemish stick WORKS like no other spot treatment I have ever used. With Salicylic acid to slough off dead skin cells and promote skin cell renewal as well as witch hazel to sooth the skin and tea tree oil to act as a natural anti-bacterial agent and skin soother, this product has powerful blemish fighting ingredients that work in harmony to banish those blemishes! Literally! This is my Holy Grail product because it will get rid of small about-to-surface pimples over night and white heads are cleared overnight, too. On larger zits, it takes about two days to fully smooth out, but the size it reduced in a single day. I use this roll-on applier over my entire t-zone because it truly shrinks pores better than any scrub or toner I&#x27;ve ever used. The only problem with the roller is that only a small amount comes out so you really do have to roll the applier over your face or spots several time to get the right amount of solution onto your skin. I actually like this, though, because you don&#x27;t have to worry about losing or wasting any product like most applier that squeeze or squirt too much out at a time. My only warning: this product has alcohol in it so your skin will dry out if you use this all over your face too often. I personally apply it all over my face twice a day but I follow by spraying rose-water all over, too, to keep my skin moisturized. This also works well under makeup and I have found that even makeup that usually breaks me out won&#x27;t cause me any problems so long as I wear this underneath. You can find this product for a dollar at Target. Go pick it up and I swear you won&#x27;t regret it. Or buy on amazon if there isn&#x27;t a store near you. You won&#x27;t regret it!&lt;br /&gt;** Oh yeah! No parabens! Beauty lovers rejoice!</li>
    <li> I just bought this and I have to say it cleared up what little acne I have on my face!</li>
    <li> Works but not faster than anything else out there.</li>
    <li> At first, it was okay. I mean it came out a little bit only, but after using a while, it stop coming out. I needed to cut it off to pull it out. horrible product, but the it helps to kill acne.</li>
    <li> I used it for more than a month and nothing has changed. Maybe if you have mild acne it would probably work. But if you have a lot of acne do not buy!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this more than a couple of weeks but as far as I can tell, this really does work. I get a few bumps about once a month and within a few days they&#x27;re clearing up fast.</li>
    <li> Still currently using this product.</li>
    <li> This works so well. My pimples become visibly smaller after each application. The smell is kinds strong when you apply but it is gone after the application.</li>
    <li> I decided to use the ELF Zit Zapper after a recommendation from a friend, &amp; because it was only a buck at Target! I get acne around my chin &amp; the sides/creases of my nose. I started applying this in the morning &amp; evening after washing my face, before applying moisturizer. I use [[ASIN:B0000536Y7 St. Ives Blemish &amp; Blackhead Control Apricot Scrub, 6 oz]], &amp; while its done a great job at reducing my acne overall, it hasn&#x27;t disappeared entirely. Usually when I get acne breakouts, they&#x27;d stick around for at least five to seven days - since I started using the Zit Zapper, I&#x27;ve noticed they&#x27;re less inflamed &amp; bumpy overnight, &amp; almost entirely gone by three to five days. This makes them much easier to conceal using [[ASIN:B003FBRUCC Neutrogena SkinClearing Blemish Concealer, Fair 05, 0.05 Ounce]]. This stuff works amazing well for the price, &amp; its easy to use since its a gentle ball roll-on. My only (minor) complaint is that is does smell a little musky, due to the different herbal oils, but you really can&#x27;t notice it after a few minutes!</li>
    <li> I use this product and within 2 days my zit is gone, great price with the same active ingredients as the higher priced products.</li>
    <li> I have mild acne and breakouts, but after using these a couple of times a day with my other face wash products my acne has cleared up pretty well! It hasn&#x27;t really dried my face out either, it&#x27;s a really good buy!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my teenager. Pleased with results.</li>
    <li> First off, let me say that I am not at all acne prone. I can count on one hand the number of pimples I&#x27;ve had in my life.  But a couple months ago, I developed some pretty big whiteheads. I think it may have been from a crappy foundation. At the time they developed, I was trying various different drugstore foundations. So it could have been any one of them. I&#x27;m not sure which one. But I had quite a few whiteheads. I had one on my right cheek, a cluster of four on my forehead, and another cluster of 4 on the very top of my forehead, just under my hairline. I tried several different products to try to get rid of the whiteheads, but nothing really worked. I tried Clean and Clear Acne Spot Treatment (salicylic acid) a tea tree oil cream, and Neutrogena On the Spot Acne Treatment (Benzoyl Peroxide) I used them all 2-3 times a day, for over a month, but there was no change in my whiteheads. I was getting frustrated and discouraged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work as a cashier. I recently had a customer come through my line and buy this Zit Zapper. She asked me if I&#x27;d ever tried it, and told me a friend of hers swears by it. I told her I&#x27;d never tried it. I know we sell quite a bit of it though. I had some time to kill after work, and my curiosity got the better of me. I decided to buy some. I had very low expectations. My skin is extremely sensitive and very allergy-prone. I figured I&#x27;d use it once, have an allergic reaction, and end up tossing it in the trash. But then I realized, I didn&#x27;t have anything to lose. After all, it only costs $1. So if it ended up in the trash, it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;d be out a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is how I apply it. First, I completely remove my makeup. Then I roll the product on to my fingertip and spread a thin layer on the whiteheads. I let it dry, (which takes only a few seconds) and then apply a second layer. I apply it just before I go to bed, so it has a chance to soak in and do it&#x27;s thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 days now. Itis AMAZING! The cluster of whiteheads just below my hairline is almost completely gone. The cluster on my forehead and the one on my cheek, have also shrunk significantly. I think it will take only one or two more treatments before they are gone completely. I see and feel improvement every time I use it. I&#x27;ve also used this after cleansing my face after my shower. I use it under my primer and foundation. It dries clear, so no one even knows I have it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin tolerates this product really well. I haven&#x27;t had ANY problems at all as far as irritation or allergic reactions. In addition to being sensitive and allergy prone, my skin is also extremely oily. The Clean and Clear Acne Spot Treatment caused a slight burning sensation. It didn&#x27;t do much to shrink my whiteheads, but it definitely caused the surrounding skin to become very dry and flaky. But I didn&#x27;t have either of those issues with this Zit Zapper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews where the smell seems to be an issue for a lot of people. People have commented that it smells terrible, but it&#x27;s not an issue for me. In fact, I rather like the smell. This product doesn&#x27;t have a lot of complicated ingredients. It contains salicylic acid, witch hazel, and tea tree oil. That&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned earlier, I only rarely get pimples, so I can&#x27;t really comment on how it works for that. But it has worked wonders on my whiteheads/clogged pores. I hope I don&#x27;t get any more whiteheads, but if I do, I will definitely use this product again. I have already purchased a second tube, and will continue to repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first E.L.F. product I&#x27;ve ever used. I have to say, I&#x27;m very impressed. This product works great and it works quickly. Best of all, it only costs $1! This works better than products that cost more than double the price. Give a try, if you don&#x27;t like it or it doesn&#x27;t work for you, you&#x27;re only out a dollar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for all skin types. It canbe used on even the most sensitive skin. Great product.</li>
    <li> Great product. I would buy it at target or something though. Much cheaper there.</li>
    <li> I absolute love this product. It really works for me. I have to use a couple times but it makes the acne disappear completely after a couple days</li>
    <li> I purchase this product at a local store. It works for me.. beautifully. I apply it only to the area that is inflamed. I&#x27;ve found that for the really troublesum blemishes that applying through out the day has dramatic results. Both for beginning signs of a blemish and after care. I have always used Witchhazel and Tea Tree Oil on my face for my moderate to severe acne, this product has both.. with the convenience of being pocket size.</li>
    <li> I have to say I really love this product. I used to have severe cystic acne years ago which I would probably not recommend using this product on. I cleared that up with prescription topical solutions and birth control (my acne was hormone related as a lot of people&#x27;s is). Even after the major treatments and even &amp;#34;growing out of&amp;#34; acne to some extent, I am still, at 25 years old, highly prone to break outs and my skin never really seems clear or fresh looking. This product has helped me in two ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, when I get a serious, painful, swollen cystic break out (which happens probably once every few months), this is part of my line of attack. I ice the spot on and off to reduce swelling (SUPER important with those painful swollen red bumps, especially if they throb and ache) and when I take the ice off, I saturate it with this stuff. I ice it for about 10 minutes at a time and then take a 30-60 minute break. I do this as often as possible. I have taken out a giant zit in a single day, which used to be impossible for me. Those suckers would last weeks. Even with just icing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I am prone to random clusters of headless (neither black nor white headed) bumps on my forehead and by my nose. This was frustrating the crap out of me so I started saturating those areas with this stuff nightly. This used to be a chronic problem, now I have NO bumps. It took about three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep doing it because I&#x27;m trying to get my pores from looking so clogged, not sure if that&#x27;s happening as much as I&#x27;d like, but it&#x27;s worth a shot! Anyway, giant zits and tiny bump clusters are gone. But like I said earlier, I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for all-over, chronic, major acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other very important tip: Always, always, ALWAYS start with a clean face at the beginning of treatment and moisturize either right before you zit-zap or right after. This WILL dry your skin. And likely so will washing it. Dry skin &#x3D; break outs. Find a moisturizer that your face likes and go over-board. Good luck!</li>
    <li> Product works great but it cost $1 everywhere else.</li>
    <li> Great product! Dries all my breakouts right up. I don&#x27;t really have what is considered acne, just occasional breakouts but its works perfectly for my skin.</li>
    <li> Doesnt really work, my acne didnt get any better like i expected but were ever else the product touches it dries it horrendously.</li>
    <li> i thought it works temporary.</li>
    <li> Excellent Value! It is easy to use, store and apply. It does not over dry the skin area and can be reapplied.</li>
    <li> gets rid of zits really fast</li>
    <li> I saw results a day after applying it! Love it!! Full review soon on my YouTube channel: xolaurieox</li>
    <li> This stuff works.  I don&#x27;t like the roller ball packaging as it doesn&#x27;t seem very hygienic to me but it does work well.</li>
    <li> I carry my Zit Zapper with me everyday. Its the perfect travel size. Similar to a tube of lip gloss. Its main ingredient is syclic acid which is found in most face washes! So it is perfect for on the spot  Zit control. it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and it goes on smooth so you can apply it throughout the day! definitely a must have I have had it for over about 6 months now and I still have a ton left .</li>
    <li> Honestly, this thing works fast and it works well. Simply gets rid of redness and even gets rid of blemishes no matter what the stage.</li>
