      <li>The ingredients are great, and I would use this lotion based off these factors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great for hands and cuticles</li>
      <li>These products make great baby gifts, too.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m in love!!</li>
      <li>just amazing!</li>
      <li>I really loved this lotion for a number of reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why that is, but I would describe it like when something tastes good</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t need a lot of it to cover a good size</li>
      <li>Good lotion,  not greasy</li>
      <li>Not as good as the body cream.</li>
      <li>If you like the smell, I&#x27;m sure it would be a very nice cream.</li>

      <li>This is an amazing moisturizer.</li>
      <li>, I tried a combination of Honest Company&#x27;s bath wash, Vanicream and Aquaphor.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First, I tried Honest Company&#x27;s bath wash and lotion.</li>
      <li>make my mistake in thinking all natural is always the best.</li>
      <li>make my mistake in thinking all natural is always the best.</li>
      <li>/&gt;1) I can use it on my face and body--multiuse is very important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I just love this product.</li>
      <li>I would have stuck with them if they had worked because I love the ingredients and EWG (Environmental Working Group) ratings, but they just did not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think California Calendula Cream is better.</li>
      <li>(Badger is mostly olive oil.)</li>
      <li>I am sure I would be happier with an unscented version or one that has the apple scent like in their sunblock.  </li>
      <li>Lovely scent that lingers, but isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
      <li>I love the shampoo but</li>
      <li>is my winning combination:&lt;br /&gt;(1)</li>
      <li>I love the ingredients as well.</li>
      <li>It really did feel like a miracle!!!!</li>
      <li>This product works great for my 7 month old&#x27;s cheeks.</li>
      <li>Not greasy and easily absorbs into skin.</li>
      <li>the lotion/cream&#x27;s scent is too strong.</li>

      <li>It rubs in pretty quickly and absorbs nicely.  </li>
      <li>I would use it more at night right before bed.  </li>
      <li>The smell is very distinct - it smells like my grandmother who died almost 25 yrs ago now</li>

      <li>Love this new Babo cream!</li>
      <li>I recently had the pleasure of reviewing the Babo Botanicals Moisturizing Cream for free in exchange for my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love how organic this is, it has a mild scent creamy texture and goes on great,it&#x27;s not oily and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation to my two month old</li>
      <li>, that&#x27;s how distinct it is.</li>
      <li>This moisturizing cream is THE BEST of both worlds - sinks in better than a typical LOTION, but doesn&#x27;t leave as much sticky residue as an OIL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>We started using it on my son just once a day, right before bed</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice lotion, it goes on smooth, and isn&#x27;t sticky or heavy.  </li>
      <li>I bought this wash and lotion and his eczema was clearing up after the first bath.  </li>
      <li>Because of this, I have tried many different solutions to help remedy the redness and itching.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty concentrated</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am pleased to say that Babo Botanicals Moisturizer Cream is actually made here in the USA.  </li>
      <li>I love when we are supporting local</li>
      <li>This lightweight whipped formula contains a light and comforting natural scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply</li>
      <li>and I still have most of the product left.</li>
      <li>The smell is a little strong, but not terrible.</li>
      <li>This miracle cream is definitely miraculous, it leaves you with soft skin and as a bonus smells amazing.</li>
      <li>At first it does have a very oily feel to it</li>
      <li>I have been looking for more long term moisturizing solutions</li>
      <li>We were so blessed to find out about this new product &amp; receive a container of it right about then.  </li>
      <li>My son has the Most dry cracked hands and he loves this!</li>
      <li>Unlike a lot of baby (and adult) moisturizers which can be thick and gloppy, this formula feels very light and elegant.</li>
      <li>I really stopped even trying for a while there.</li>
      <li>Thanks Babo</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
      <li>and I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>My baby&#x27;s skin was so sensitive she needed &amp;#34;medication&amp;#34; for it and Mustela worked for her!!</li>

      <li>My 2 year old son has mild to moderate skin allergies and eczema.</li>
      <li>Only 12 dollar and works better than the 100 $ plus fancy products my wide uses!</li>
      <li>Angel Baby Oil (from Earth Mama Angel Baby, just for an added all natural element, to get the calendula in there, and to help her scalp.</li>

      <li>My infant developed eczema on his torso.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This cream comes in a small container which makes it easy to take whether you put it in a diaper bag, backpack, or purse.</li>
      <li>I used to buy high priced moisturizing products and using this all natural affordable miracle cream brought me the same results on my complexion.</li>
      <li>It is a gentle formula that can be used on anyone in your family that has irritated, dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I have had a hard time finding lotion that works for my kids, they all have ezcema problems, and Babo works quickly!</li>
      <li>Extra gentle cream soothes &amp; comforts sensitive or dry skin</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t quite pinpoint the scent, but I generally don&#x27;t buy scented</li>
      <li>I like to use it to massage our ten month old after bath time, it relaxes him and puts him to sleep.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am truly amazed by this product!  I absolutely LOVE all of the Babo Botanical products that my family has tried, so I am not surprised that this one is good.  But, it truly lives up to it&#x27;s name!  My son has super-sensitive skin, eczema, allergies to artificial fragrances, etc.  A couple of months ago, he started constantly itching all over.  The doctors recommended coating him in hydrocortisone twice a day, along with oral allergy medication.  This made me shudder, but we tried it for a couple of days to no effect.  Then we tried Aveno eczema cream.  Nothing was working.  We were so blessed to find out about this new product &amp; receive a container of it right about then.  We started using it on my son just once a day, right before bed and his itching was gone!  Within only a couple of days, he was back to his old self, no walking around scratching like crazy.  It really did feel like a miracle!!!!</li>
    <li> I should start off by saying I&#x27;m already a Babo Botanicals enthusiast (and you could be one, too!), but that doesn&#x27;t mean I won&#x27;t tell the truth if I don&#x27;t like something. However, this stuff rocks! I live in Michigan and this winter was BRUTAL. It got to the point that my hands were so dry and chapped that anything I put on it would burn and leave my skin red for hours. I really stopped even trying for a while there. Then this glorious pot of goodness arrived. I put in on, cringing expectantly at what I assumed would be yet another lotion that burned my aggravated hands, but all it did was provide some instant relief. No burn. No redness. Whoa. I&#x27;m a convert! It took a few days of religious use, but my hands drastically improved and haven&#x27;t gone back to being painful since. So happy to have this product and brand! And in case you&#x27;re worried about the small size, a little goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my sons and I tried it since I have dry and sensitive skin. I am over 40 and I just love this product. Results are amazing and I would highly recommend it. I used to buy high priced moisturizing products and using this all natural affordable miracle cream brought me the same results on my complexion. Also I went on vacation and used this product as an after sun cream, just amazing! I use it as a day &amp; night cream daily.</li>
    <li> My infant developed eczema on his torso.  I bought this wash and lotion and his eczema was clearing up after the first bath.  I did use this with aveno&#x27;s baby oatmeal bath, but it&#x27;s a great combo. Good lotion,  not greasy, i like the smell (but i could see how some may not).</li>
    <li> Weird smell. Not as good as the body cream.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t terribly impressed with this cream. I think California Calendula Cream is better. The smell is very distinct - it smells like my grandmother who died almost 25 yrs ago now, that&#x27;s how distinct it is. If you like the smell, I&#x27;m sure it would be a very nice cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on myself and 7 month old. This cream goes on with a non greasy feel. Immediately after putting it you can still turn a doorknob without having it slip inside of your hand because of the greasiness.  It takes a few minutes for your hand to completely absorb it though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream comes in a small container which makes it easy to take whether you put it in a diaper bag, backpack, or purse. It spreads well so you don&#x27;t need a lot of it to cover a good size area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint (and reason for 4 stars instead of 5) would be the scent.  While it is in the container and when first rubbing in I find the scent to be very pleasant and almost relaxing.  After a minute of so though the scent seems to change for the worse. I don&#x27;t know why that is, but I would describe it like when something tastes good but then has a different after taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This reviewer received a free product for the purpose of writing a review. Amazon has not modified or edited this review.</li>
    <li> I hardly ever write reviews, but I just had to because... This moisturizing cream is THE BEST of both worlds - sinks in better than a typical LOTION, but doesn&#x27;t leave as much sticky residue as an OIL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My baby (under age 1) has had dry skin with red patches on her ears, legs, under her elbows, knees, and anywhere drool is left behind. She was constantly itchy and scratched herself to the point of bleeding sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to buy a product that wasn&#x27;t 100% organic with all natural ingredients, however, I went down a long road before I came to this one and I want to save you the time and energy I wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I tried Honest Company&#x27;s bath wash and lotion. Fail.&lt;br /&gt;Second, I tried a combination of Honest Company&#x27;s bath wash, Vanicream and Aquaphor. Helped a bit, but stopped working after a few months.&lt;br /&gt;Third, I went all natural and bought Badger Baby Balm, Badger Oil and Babo Miracle Cream. (Badger is mostly olive oil.) I really wanted to love all three products, esp. the Babo but I agreed with the reviewers that said the smell turned them off. I would have stuck with them if they had worked because I love the ingredients and EWG (Environmental Working Group) ratings, but they just did not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I bought Mustela&#x27;s Cream Wash and Moisturizing Cream!!!&lt;br /&gt;*Note: I also bought Aveeno Baby Eczema Therapy Bath (oatmeal bath packets).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hers is my winning combination:&lt;br /&gt;(1) Mustela Cream Wash in separate tub/sink&lt;br /&gt;(2) Aveeno oatmeal bath in her baby tub&lt;br /&gt;(3) Angel Baby Oil (from Earth Mama Angel Baby, just for an added all natural element, to get the calendula in there, and to help her scalp. It contains: grape seed oil, jojoba oil, and organic calendula)&lt;br /&gt;(4) Mustela Moisturizing Cream after the bath and everyday all over&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t believe the other reviewers, but after JUST ONE BATH we saw an improvement!&lt;br /&gt;It has been 3 days now and her red patches are almost all gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t make my mistake in thinking all natural is always the best. I realized sometimes we need medications and those are synthetic. My baby&#x27;s skin was so sensitive she needed &amp;#34;medication&amp;#34; for it and Mustela worked for her!! I&#x27;ve been agonizing for 10 months...Couldn&#x27;t be happier!!one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t make my mistake in thinking all natural is always the best.

    <li> My 2 year old son has mild to moderate skin allergies and eczema. Because of this, I have tried many different solutions to help remedy the redness and itching. Our doctor prescribed a steroid that worked well, but only temporarily. I have been looking for more long term moisturizing solutions and I think I have found it with babo botanicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for over a week and it definitely does what it claims. It is made for dry and sensitive skin, comforting that inflammation and itchiness that eczema causes. My only complaint and the reason I gave it 4 stars, is the scent. I can&#x27;t quite pinpoint the scent, but I generally don&#x27;t buy scented products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am anxious to try their other products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This reviewer received a free product for the purpose of writing a review.

    <li> Very good cream. Not greasy and easily absorbs into skin. I use this for myself and my baby.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing moisturizer. I use it in my face and i am over 45 yo! Only 12 dollar and works better than the 100 $ plus fancy products my wide uses!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love!! This miracle cream is definitely miraculous, it leaves you with soft skin and as a bonus smells amazing. We have two boys and I even use it on them. I like to use it to massage our ten month old after bath time, it relaxes him and puts him to sleep. I love the ingredients as well. I am definitely having this in my purse !</li>
    <li> This product works great for my 7 month old&#x27;s cheeks. He drools a lot, and he ends up with red patches around his mouth and cheeks. A little goes a long way. I suspect I won&#x27;t run out for quite some time. The smell is a little strong, but not terrible. It reminds me a little of Burts Bee&#x27;s chapstick smell. I put one tiny drop just on his cheeks, and my husband noticed when I brought my son into the room. I would use it more at night right before bed.  I have had a hard time finding lotion that works for my kids, they all have ezcema problems, and Babo works quickly!</li>
    <li> I love how organic this is, it has a mild scent creamy texture and goes on great,it&#x27;s not oily and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation to my two month old it&#x27;s a bit expensive for this tiny bottle but you only need a small amount each time.

    <li> This new cream is amazing. My son has the Most dry cracked hands and he loves this! He&#x27;s Used it on his face too! Great product you won&#x27;t be disappointed! I love the texture! Thanks Babo</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice lotion, it goes on smooth, and isn&#x27;t sticky or heavy.  The ingredients are great, and I would use this lotion based off these factors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, the smell- it&#x27;s horrible.  It reminded me of the powder that my grandmother had in her bathroom.  bla.  I gag every time I put on this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This reviewer received a free product for the purpose of writing a review. Amazon has not modified or edited this review.</li>
    <li> I really loved this lotion for a number of reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I can use it on my face and body--multiuse is very important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It can be used for adults and babies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Many times lotion leave a residue after using them, which I absolutely hate. This does not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have currently been using it on my expanding bump, being in the 8th month of pregnancy. As well as to moisturize dry areas from Florida humidity. It&#x27;s pretty concentrated so you don&#x27;t need much. I&#x27;ve been using it about every other day and I still have most of the product left. I will likely purchase in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This reviewer received a free product for the purpose of writing a review. Amazon has not modified or edited this review.</li>
    <li> I recently had the pleasure of reviewing the Babo Botanicals Moisturizing Cream for free in exchange for my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream comes in a little 2 oz container (which doesn&#x27;t seem like much, but I have learned that a little goes a long way).  It is a gentle formula that can be used on anyone in your family that has irritated, dry, sensitive skin.  I found that, unlike other lotions, it doesn&#x27;t sting when I apply it to the dry areas on my hands.  Which was an automatic relieve in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like that I do not have to sit here rubbing on a thick lather of cream trying to work it in. It rubs in pretty quickly and absorbs nicely.  At first it does have a very oily feel to it and I did not like it, but after a few minutes that feeling went away so I was relieved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased to say that Babo Botanicals Moisturizer Cream is actually made here in the USA.  I love when we are supporting local businesses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product details as listed on their website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Extra gentle cream soothes &amp; comforts sensitive or dry skin&lt;br /&gt;  Colloidal Oatmeal relieves eczema, very dry patches, irritated or chafed skin&lt;br /&gt;  Organic Calendula Oil &amp; Shea Butter soothe, moisturize &amp; soften&lt;br /&gt;  Great for hands and cuticles&lt;br /&gt;  This lightweight whipped formula contains a light and comforting natural scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply a small amount to super dry, sensitive or irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to mention that I am not a huge fan of the scent.  It has a very floral smell to me and I have never been drawn to those scents, unfortunately.  I am sure I would be happier with an unscented version or one that has the apple scent like in their sunblock.  I&#x27;m a sucker for sweet scents!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think it&#x27;s a great cream and it still does it&#x27;s job of keeping you moisturized.</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo but the lotion/cream&#x27;s scent is too strong.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything and found it sticky</li>
    <li> Love this new Babo cream! Unlike a lot of baby (and adult) moisturizers which can be thick and gloppy, this formula feels very light and elegant. I use it on my baby, but also on myself. Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel slick or greasy. Lovely scent that lingers, but isn&#x27;t overpowering. We are big consumers of Babo products - socially conscious brand, organic ingredients and no chemicals or junk. These products make great baby gifts, too.</li>
