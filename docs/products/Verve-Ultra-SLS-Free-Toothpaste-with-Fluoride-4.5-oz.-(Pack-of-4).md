      <li>This is much better than Tom&#x27;s of Maine.  </li>
      <li>This toothpaste has a nice flavor and seems to clean my teeth well.</li>
      <li>I am happy with this new SLS-free toothpaste that I tried in order to replace the Rembrant for Canker Sore Sufferers (which was discontinued).  </li>

      <li>The taste is pleasant, and so far I have not suffered from any canker sores.</li>
      <li>This is the best sls free toothpaste hands down.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for SLS free this is the one.</li>
      <li>I have to use SLS free toothpaste.</li>
      <li>FABULOUS toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>This is a fantastic no SLS toothpaste.</li>
      <li>verve, I ordered a free sample from the verve website.</li>
      <li>I found another website selling Tom of Maine&#x27;s version that was more economically and stocked up.  </li>
      <li>After Rembrandt discontinued its SLS free toothpaste, it was on to find another product.  </li>
      <li>So far, so good.</li>
      <li>Hoping this doesn&#x27;t cause cankers as I just started using this week, but so far so good.</li>
      <li>I have experienced canker sores from foods, sunflower seeds and I am sure other foods.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth, it&#x27;s got a great mint taste, and it doesn&#x27;t leave me with dry mouth.</li>
      <li>Great mild mint taste and low foaming.</li>
      <li>I like it better than the evidently discontinued Rembrant &amp;#34;G&amp;#34; toothpaste</li>
      <li>Thank you for getting it just right!</li>
      <li>Sweet mint versus spicy mint</li>
      <li>This is been a true life saver.</li>
      <li>It tastes better than the Rembrandt Gentle, but that toothpaste flowed out of the tube more like normal toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>The taste is a very pleassant Spearming which I think is great.&lt;br /&gt;There is also Tom&#x27;s of Maine which has an SLS free toothpaste.</li>
      <li>My family is very susceptible to canker sores, so this SLS free formulation has been a Godsend.</li>
      <li>, Squigle, Toms of Maine, Closys, and a Whole Foods SLS free brand</li>
      <li>suggest buying this product, even though it is a quantity of 4, it will be worth it.  </li>
      <li>If you seem to continue to get them, this product is worth a try.  </li>
      <li>I tried Squigle too, and it didn&#x27;t seem to leave a fresh feeling.  </li>
      <li>Squigle did not leave a fresh mouth feeling, at all.  </li>
      <li>Worth the price</li>
      <li>Well worth the money, I am stocking up on this stuff.</li>
      <li>, gel is just right (not gooey).</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m ulcer free so far!!  </li>
      <li>Tastes good, leaves teeth feeling clean, no more canker sores.</li>
      <li>Great fresh taste, although it was too hard to get the toothpaste out of the tube I got.  </li>
      <li>ever since rembrandt got rid of its SLS free toothpaste I had to find a new one.</li>
      <li>Something that I find that is lacking from many of the other available products.  </li>
      <li>The big plus is that it has a nice consistency (the Rembrandt used to get hard) and a really good taste.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this toothpaste for only a week and notice a HUGE difference in my mouth!</li>
      <li>Thanks Verve Ultra!</li>
      <li>I am finally getting some relief :).</li>
      <li>First, I&#x27;d like to know how you get it out of the tube.  </li>
      <li>I even called their parent company and wrote them (as they said many have done the same)</li>
      <li>Very concerned when Rembrandt stopped making their SLS-free toothpaste.....reviews of others led me to Verve and they were right.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel like it gets my teeth as clean as the Colegate Total which I had been using (and love).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I&#x27;m just more diligent about brushing and will keep on using this toothpaste as long as it reduces the canker sores.  </li>
      <li>I literally was almost in tears when I found out that Rembrandt had discontinued its Gentle White SLS Free toothpaste.</li>
      <li>and I still remember I could not eat my chocolate covered strawberries because it hurt too much.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend !</li>
      <li>For Canker Sore Relief was discontinued, I tried several SLS free toothpastes in my hunt for a replacement.  </li>
      <li>Before I purchased this I used Sensodyne toothpaste, which really helped regarding tooth sensitivity while whitening and this seems to be working well for that as well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used pro enamel which did clean but left a chalky taste on your teeth.  </li>
      <li>Ive been looking for toothpaste free of sls and betaines for a very long time...</li>
      <li>It might work okay at reducing canker sore episodes, but I used it less than a couple of days, so I cannot attest to whether it works or not.  </li>
      <li>This toothpaste is also high in anticavity contents (i.e. fluoride) which is another plus.</li>
      <li>The taste is standard peppermint, which I am not crazy about</li>
      <li>so I know my diet really isn&#x27;t a huge contributor to canker sores, other than the sunflower seeds I eat.  </li>
      <li>I have bought other SLS free brands that didn&#x27;t suds up</li>
      <li>I used to brush with store-bought toothpaste for years and one day picked up Crest Pro-Health since it was on sale (it&#x27;s a pretty popular toothpaste; didn&#x27;t think I could go wrong).</li>
      <li>I eat very clean and am an active individual</li>
      <li>When Rembrandt Toothpaste - Extra Gentle -</li>
      <li>I used to suffer from canker sores, but Verve toothpaste almost completely eliminated the problem.  </li>
      <li>If you have canker sores regularly, you really need this (or another SLS-free toothpaste).  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this toothpaste to anyone who is sensitive to SLS.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Too difficult to squeeze the paste from the tube.</li>
    <li> I am prone to canker sores and learned that the preservative SLS could be contributing to the issue.  I used to buy Burt&#x27;s Bees toothpaste, but they stopped making it.  Tom&#x27;s didn&#x27;t seem to work and it was hard to find the ONE product they made without SLS anyway.  I am so glad I found Verve.  I still get canker sores around that time of the month, but not nearly as often as I used to.  Please don&#x27;t stop making this!</li>
    <li> This stuff is terrible.  First, I&#x27;d like to know how you get it out of the tube.  I had to literally squeeze the whole tube in one hand as hard as I could to get a drop onto the toothbrush.  The taste was okay but after 3 days, I could feel plaque around the base of my teeth so knew it was not cleaning.  I used pro enamel which did clean but left a chalky taste on your teeth.  A, waiting on my tube of closyn to arrive as I feel that will be the best.</li>
    <li> it comes out of the tube very dry.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste has a nice flavor and seems to clean my teeth well. It is quite difficult to get it out of the tube  because it is so thick. I use it because I get mouth sores from most toothpaste.</li>
    <li> After Rembrandt discontinued its SLS free toothpaste, it was on to find another product.  I stumbled upon Verve and I am very happy with it.  I have an allergy to SLS and instantly gives me cancer sores.  If you seem to continue to get them, this product is worth a try.  It has great taste.  Something that I find that is lacking from many of the other available products.  I will warn you, SLS is similar to a soap, so you won&#x27;t get the foam you are used to with toothpaste.  But SLS is also used for removing grease so at least it isn&#x27;t in your toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Reason for my purchase: I have always experienced issues with canker sores in my mouth.  Essentially, for me, canker sores develop when I am getting sick and they multiply very quickly.  As I have aged (I am only 26) I have experienced canker sores from foods, sunflower seeds and I am sure other foods.  I eat very clean and am an active individual so I know my diet really isn&#x27;t a huge contributor to canker sores, other than the sunflower seeds I eat.  In addition, I get them from stress; graduate school hasn&#x27;t helped my cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How well it worked for me: OUTSTANDING! I have been using this toothpaste for only a week and notice a HUGE difference in my mouth! I can usually tell right away when I am going to get an inflamed taste bud or canker sore. This toothpaste has helped immensely to diminish my existing canker sores, relieve a majority of sore inflammation and prevent new ones from developing.  I know this because when I develop one sore I begin to get several other around my mouth. I used to just get them on the outer wall of inside my mouth and now they develop on my tongue, which is twice as painful. I also experience fevers from them, so I really understand how painful they can be.  Before I purchased this I used Sensodyne toothpaste, which really helped regarding tooth sensitivity while whitening and this seems to be working well for that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest buying this product, even though it is a quantity of 4, it will be worth it.  I use it in combination with prevention everyday mouth rinse.  I have also purchased prevention oncology mouth rinse, which I use when I have a flare of sores, and they both have helped A LOT in combination.  I am finally getting some relief :).</li>
    <li> Great fresh taste, although it was too hard to get the toothpaste out of the tube I got.  It was as if it was old or too thick.  It tastes better than the Rembrandt Gentle, but that toothpaste flowed out of the tube more like normal toothpaste.  I tried Squigle too, and it didn&#x27;t seem to leave a fresh feeling.  Tom&#x27;s of Maine next....</li>
    <li> Finally!!!  A toothpaste without industrial detergents!!!!!!!!! Ive been looking for toothpaste free of sls and betaines for a very long time...thank you verve</li>
    <li> FABULOUS toothpaste.  Great taste and best of all, it keeps canker sores away.  I only wish they continued to offer the travel size which fits so well in my bathroom cabinet.</li>
    <li> This is refreshing and cleans well. Does the job much better than Toms of Maine. If you&#x27;re looking for SLS free this is the one.</li>
    <li> I used to brush with store-bought toothpaste for years and one day picked up Crest Pro-Health since it was on sale (it&#x27;s a pretty popular toothpaste; didn&#x27;t think I could go wrong). Well, I finished a tube of that stuff and bam! I developed really bad canker sores -- lots of them. Went back to my usual store-bought toothpaste but got canker sores with that one, too. My dentist said I likely developed a sensitivity to SLS with the Pro-Health toothpaste and now needed to use a SLS-free toothpaste, but they&#x27;re hard to find in stores. Found Verve Ultra on Amazon and it works great. Leaves that nice, fresh, minty feeling after I brush and doesn&#x27;t cause any mouth irritation whatsoever. Worth the price and I hope Amazon continues to carry it!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic no SLS toothpaste. Great results. Good taste. It actually foams up like regular toothpaste. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothpaste ever.  I used to suffer from canker sores, but Verve toothpaste almost completely eliminated the problem.  If I do get one now, they heal right away,  Really awesome.</li>
    <li> ever since rembrandt got rid of its SLS free toothpaste I had to find a new one. I have tried a number of them.&lt;br /&gt;For verve, I ordered a free sample from the verve website. The taste is a very pleassant Spearming which I think is great.&lt;br /&gt;There is also Tom&#x27;s of Maine which has an SLS free toothpaste. The taste is standard peppermint, which I am not crazy about but if you like peppermint you will like it..&lt;br /&gt;I also tried Squigle and Closys and did not like the taste.</li>
    <li> If you are troubled by mouth sores, this is the toothpaste for you. No sodium laurel sulfate &#x3D; no mouth sores. Tastes good, too.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this new SLS-free toothpaste that I tried in order to replace the Rembrant for Canker Sore Sufferers (which was discontinued).  The taste is pleasant, and so far I have not suffered from any canker sores. I would recommend this toothpaste to anyone who is sensitive to SLS.</li>
    <li> I got this as a replacement for Rembrandt G (formerly Rembrandt for Canker Sores) when Rembrandt discontinued it.  Awesome product for anyone with canker sores due to SLS!  Not a sore in sight since I started using it.  Tastes better and feels cleaner than Rembrandt G did, too.  If you have canker sores regularly, you really need this (or another SLS-free toothpaste).  I do not exaggerate when I say it will change your life...those who suffer from canker sores know what I mean!</li>
    <li> Love Verve. Very concerned when Rembrandt stopped making their SLS-free toothpaste.....reviews of others led me to Verve and they were right. Taste is fresh and not sweet (yay!), gel is just right (not gooey). Thank you for getting it just right!</li>
    <li> I like it. Good replacement for Rembrandt</li>
    <li> I have been using this specific toothpaste for over 2 years. It has changed my life. I used to get 1 to 2 canker sores a month since I was a teenager. They would be the big ones that affected my ability to eat, brush my teeth and sometimes speak. I got one really bad before my wedding day and I still remember I could not eat my chocolate covered strawberries because it hurt too much. Since I have been using this toothpaste (way before Amazon started selling) it I get 1 to 2 canker sores A YEAR! I buy it in bulk now.</li>
    <li> Have used this paste for years. Great mild mint taste and low foaming.</li>
    <li> I suffer from severe canker sores in my mouth, as do both my children.  I used to use the Rembrandt Canker Sore toothpaste, but it&#x27;s been discontinued.  We tried this based on reviews.  The big plus is that it has a nice consistency (the Rembrandt used to get hard) and a really good taste.  Sweet mint versus spicy mint (as my kids would describe it.)  The two downsides are:&lt;br /&gt;1.  By the end of 2 minutes of brushing, it feels like there&#x27;s no toothpaste left in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;2.  I don&#x27;t feel like it gets my teeth as clean as the Colegate Total which I had been using (and love).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I&#x27;m just more diligent about brushing and will keep on using this toothpaste as long as it reduces the canker sores.  Can&#x27;t say that yet.  Crossing my fingers!</li>
    <li> Very happy I found it. Helped solve the problem of ulcers and inflamed tissue with a pleasant taste.</li>
    <li> For chronic canker sores, this is the only thing that will help minimize the pain and suffering. Highly recommend !</li>
    <li> I literally was almost in tears when I found out that Rembrandt had discontinued its Gentle White SLS Free toothpaste. I had used that toothpaste for 15 years. I even called their parent company and wrote them (as they said many have done the same) so who knows maybe one day it will return. But until that day I started my quest for a substitute. I bought Rembrant&#x27;s Deeply White (which they said was a substitute...NOT!), Squigle, Toms of Maine, Closys, and a Whole Foods SLS free brand but didn&#x27;t like any of them. I went online and found Verve Ultra and so far it is the best of all of them. I literally tossed all the other ones in the garbage yesterday. Hoping this doesn&#x27;t cause cankers as I just started using this week, but so far so good. YEAH!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for over two months (bought October 3, 2014). I do not suffer from canker sores, so I can&#x27;t speak to that. However, I didn&#x27;t like the dry mouth I would get after using the foamy toothpastes with SLS. I tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine and didn&#x27;t like it. I think it was too bland for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I then tried Verve based on the great reviews and I must say it is a fantastic toothpaste! It&#x27;s smooth, it&#x27;s got a great mint taste, and it doesn&#x27;t leave me with dry mouth. It does take a few brushings to get used to having the sensory feeling of less toothpaste because it doesn&#x27;t foam, but it&#x27;s worth the perseverance.</li>
    <li> I like it better than the evidently discontinued Rembrant &amp;#34;G&amp;#34; toothpaste</li>
    <li> Had frequent canker sores for 5 years. Dentist recommended and now no more.&lt;br /&gt;Super happy with the product. Got to eat my first girl scout thin mint cookie with no worries of a reaction.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. My current go to toothpaste since Oral-B discontinued the Rembarndt &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; type toothpaste. very nice alternative.</li>
    <li> I have to use SLS free toothpaste. This brand is reasonably priced and the paste still works like regular tooth paste. I have bought other SLS free brands that didn&#x27;t suds up and I felt that my teeth were not clean. This product works perfectly!</li>
    <li> Tastes good, leaves teeth feeling clean, no more canker sores.</li>
    <li> My family is very susceptible to canker sores, so this SLS free formulation has been a Godsend. I highly recommend this toothpaste; it doesn&#x27;t cause pain when brushing even with an active sore.</li>
    <li> When Rembrandt Toothpaste - Extra Gentle - For Canker Sore Relief was discontinued, I tried several SLS free toothpastes in my hunt for a replacement.  Verve Ultra leaves a long lasting fresh mouth taste.  I&#x27;m sticking with this one.  I thought CloSYS left an odd metallic lingering taste, and tossed it after one use.  Squigle did not leave a fresh mouth feeling, at all.  I&#x27;m not surprised that Verve has been rated so highly on the customer reviews.  I like that Verve has fluoride and is made in the USA.  I&#x27;m very pleased with Verve.</li>
    <li> If you suffer with canker sores get this. For years I had them all the time, huge and painful stared using this maybe two small ones a year now. It works!!</li>
    <li> Other toothpastes were causing my mouth to blister, and I finally searched for and found what was called a hypo-allergenic toothpaste. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Iwas not happy with other products on the market. This product by far surpassed other products, verve ultra is cheaper and of higher quality.</li>
    <li> Tastes and smells great...performs as well as regular toothpaste and I&#x27;m ulcer free so far!!  I plan on giving this out as xmas gifts for the rest of the fam that suffers from mouth ulcers!</li>
    <li> This is been a true life saver. I tried many different toothpastes trying to figure out how to cut down on the repetitive canker sores (to include sores on my tongue which is probably the absolute worse place to get them). I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for about 3 weeks and have gotten zero sores. After averaging one to two sores a month, its nice to be able to talk and eat with no pain. This toothpaste is also high in anticavity contents (i.e. fluoride) which is another plus. It has .24% of fluoride, which beats out the .15% of fluoride in Sensodyne. I haven&#x27;t really seen any other brand of non-SLS toothpaste with that can match that amount of fluoride. Well worth the money, I am stocking up on this stuff.</li>
    <li> I was using Rembrandt canker sore toothpaste, and it worked great at reducing canker sore occurrence.  I can no longer find the toothpaste, so I used a similar product of Tom of Maine&#x27;s.  This toothpaste came in a close second to the Rembrandt toothpaste.  Amazon sells Tom of Maines, but it was selling $10 for one tube!  I looked for a cheaper alternative and purchased Verve Ultra SLS-Free.  First, it was very difficult to get out of the tube, and second it tasted terribly.  It might work okay at reducing canker sore episodes, but I used it less than a couple of days, so I cannot attest to whether it works or not.  I found another website selling Tom of Maine&#x27;s version that was more economically and stocked up.  I threw out my 4 pack of the Verve toothpaste.</li>
    <li> works well with wearing braces</li>
    <li> This is the best sls free toothpaste hands down.  Since Rembrandt stopped making their canker soar toothpaste I have searched high and low for a comparable toothpaste.  I have tried a few over this time and after I found this I will not change.  This is much better than Tom&#x27;s of Maine.  I have not gotten one canker sore with this toothpaste and my job has been terribly stressful. The mint flavor is strong and is comparable to crest toothpaste without the sls. Thanks Verve Ultra!</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste, now my go-to toothpaste. I was looking for an SLS-free toothpaste, and this also has a nice pleasing freshness.</li>
