<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product really tighten up your skin. I was shocked well it worked for me. It&#x27;s a must have if you lost weight and you have those cellulite left over because of it.</li>
    <li> Love this cream!  After over a week of using my thighs are noticably smoother.  It has a pleasant smell and the bottle is shaped conveniently for application.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical this cream would work, as I&#x27;ve tried others without results.  Within a few applications, I could tell a difference.  I applied it to one side of my thigh, but not the other, and there was more firmness and the dimpling was noticeably smaller on the side I used the cream on.  It&#x27;s very lightweight and has a mild scent.  Definitely recommend this cream if you are wanting results!</li>
    <li> This is truly a blessing! A cream that doses what it says. After using for several days I thought my eyes were deceiving me, but after continuous use I am able to see a dramatic difference in the tone and tightening and the cellulite bumpiness is smoothing away.  And the loose skin that was starting to develop is tightening, too!</li>
    <li> This is wonderful cellulite cream. I can tell a difference on my tummy and my butt. It doesn&#x27;t take much easy, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I got this product to reduce the cellulite on my thighs.  You can almost feel the skin tightening when you put it on.  It absorbs easily into my skin and leaves it silky smooth.  When you smell the cream in the bottle is smells like coconut but when you put it on, it&#x27;s a cinnamon/brown sugar smell.  Best of all it is paraben free.  Parabens have been in the media lately regarding their connection to breast cancer so I always look for paraben free.  The pump bottle dispenser is nice too.</li>
    <li> First of all this is a SPRAY, not a sticky cream. I love that it&#x27;s not in a tube or jar, the spray makes it easier to use and reaches more places. Absorbs quickly when used with a messager. Smells nice. On my secend week and I&#x27;m starting to see a little less dimples. OH and it&#x27;s Paraben free.</li>
    <li> Did nothing, dont like the pump bottle.</li>
    <li> Love it! Can tell quite a difference in only a week. Works best with the massager.</li>
    <li> This cream has a nice light scent that is very pleasant. It&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky, oily, or greasy in any way. The cream absorbs quickly into my skin. It helps with making skin feel smoother and more even textured. Definitely a nice product. I love that this comes in a pump form instead of a jar too.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my skin :(</li>
    <li> So I was skeptical about this. I have kinda droppy loose skin on my stomach. I just started applying this lotion twice a day 2 days ago and my husband noticed and said that my stomach was starting to go back to the way it used to be. In only 2 days, the skin of my stomach is now  feels smoother to the touch. I still have the stretch marks but I will work on those after I use this product. So far so good! Very satisfied with the results!</li>
    <li> Great quality cream, really like that it&#x27;s Paraben Free, comes in a convenient spray bottle which is easy to carry around and it has a very nice light smell which is great too.This cream seems to really help reduce the appearance of cellulite, my skin now looks far more smoother and feels softer, loving it and would recommend it to all my friends for sure! Also will buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m being patient waiting to see results.&lt;br /&gt;Hope the product works like it promises to.</li>
    <li> Of course having a kid has made things go south, slip, droop, and worst of all......become bumping and uneven under my skin. I hate my stretch marks but I have my cellulite even more. I learned from a friend that this was available on amazon and I could try it from the seller. So I took them up on their off and needless to say I&#x27;m very impressed. In the short time of use I can see a difference and it is so soft, smooth, and easy to apply! I will definitely order this again when I start running low!</li>
    <li> Best cellulite cream ever!!! My 3rd day and seen results all ready. My skin feels and looks more soft and toned. Great coconut smell.</li>
    <li> Best Cellulite cream smells absolutely amazing, almost like a tropical coconut type scent. The scent is mild but enough to make someone not have to use a perfume. It leaves your skin feelings soft. I have been using it a little over a week, perhaps two. I would like to give it a longer time before saying it actually did the trick completely. However, between this and diet and exercise, I am seeing a difference. This is a product that I will continue to use for a prolonged period of time to see the difference and because it smells so good!</li>
    <li> Great value, amazing product! I love the smell of it, and how smooth this glides on. Other creams that I have used to help with cellulite, didn&#x27;t feel as nice as this one does when applied. I will continue to use this product and look for more wonderful products from this company. They obviously know what they are doing! Thank You!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products but this one finally looks like the right one.</li>
    <li> I think all cellulite creams are pretty much the same but this one smells decent which is nice.</li>
    <li> didnt seem to do anything...</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I am using  it since a couple  of weeks and have seen some results from the first application. It has a nice smell, is not sticky and absorbs quite good and fast.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very sensitive, and normally cellulite creams tend to irritate it, after a while. With this product so far, I did not have any kind of problem.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again. Is good value for money.&lt;br /&gt;Have tried many expensive treatments in the past, and this one is perhaps one of the best creams tried so far.</li>
    <li> not sure about cellulite reduction but skin was soft</li>
    <li> I like the smell and the feel of the lotion but I can&#x27;t tell a bit of difference in the amount of cellulite.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a great improvement on my cellulite. And the bottle doesn&#x27;t last too long cause it is not big. I expected better results.</li>
    <li> Loved the cream very smooth and love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell like other creams...</li>
    <li> I love it and need more!</li>
    <li> MY girlfriend has been using this for the last 4 weeks and loves it, She says it is making her legs feel tighter then they even have and that she is not seeing all the cellulite spots on the back of her legs anymore. I will be buying this for her as long as she wants me to.</li>
    <li> smells great, feels great! But I haven&#x27;t noticed any results.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any changes at all. I&#x27;m active and I work out also but this product did Not help with Cellulite at all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed :(</li>
    <li> I like this item its still to early to see results. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad. Also I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t come off like other creams I bought. I hope it works</li>
    <li> Smells great, ordered for my Best friend, she said it goes on smooth and she loves it because it&#x27;s made with such great ingredients !</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t see any effect. I thought i would receive the brush</li>
    <li> It makes my skin soft. The pump is a little difficult to use. It comes out in small amounts, and with your hands slippery from applying the cream, the pump has a tendency to slip in your hands.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it worked or not</li>
    <li> Great moisurizer, have not seen much of a reduction in cellulite as of yet.  May take more than one bottle to see noticeable results.</li>
    <li> love the product the lotion does work but you also have to do your part of the deal to keep your body tone or slim the only thing i dont like about it is that they said you&#x27;ll get that free massager thing since it comes with the lotion. Well that&#x27;s a lie you only get the body.</li>
    <li> This the 3rd supply of Simonida I have ordered from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;This supply smells different from the oher 2.&lt;br /&gt;It smells like sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;It left me wondering if this order is really Simonida?&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the product has updated, not sure.&lt;br /&gt;Did not file with Amazon. But somewhat concerned.</li>
    <li> I like this cream. It certainly smells better than most cellulite creams, and I have tried my fair share, believe me. I have seen a noticeable decrease in cellulite, but I have also been dieting, working out 6 days a week, and wearing bioceramic cellulite shorts, so I cannot attribute my results to this cream alone and cannot factor out the variables.</li>
    <li> I can see a little firming around my buttocks area!  On my second bottle now, will keep you&#x27;ll with more updates..</li>
    <li> I am not sure why people are saying this is a spray because I got this too and it wasn&#x27;t a spray. It was a &amp;#34;pump&amp;#34; action lotion and you have to rub it into your skin, like all lotions. I really like this. I love the scent too. It has a light scent and is not strong at all. Smells so elegant and feminine. It sort of smells like coconuts to me but a very light scent. It absorbs quickly into my skin and moisturizes well. However, I don&#x27;t put it everywhere since it&#x27;s a small bottle and wouldn&#x27;t last long if I did. This is not greasy at all. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know anything about the claims but it does make my skin feel soft and smooth. It also moisturizes well. I hope to see further results with continued use.</li>
    <li> I like this cellulite cream because it contains all natural ingredients like shea butter, avocado oil and coffee bean extract to name a few. It helps eliminate the look of cellulite by rehydrating the skin and getting rid of all those nasty unwanted toxins. It works great on my sensitive skin and has a light, fresh fragrance. The pump makes it easy to dispense just the right amount so you don&#x27;t waste any and it makes my skin so incredibly soft! My skin just soaks it all up so it doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue. Definitely a must after my shower.</li>
    <li> Great product! Really helps firm skin! It even seems to be helping my stretch marks!</li>
    <li> I only received the cream and had to pay seperate for the massager. There were no instructions on how much to use. Seems to be fixing the one area I needed it for.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very silky and the pump dispenser prevents waste, as a little goes a long way. No unpleasant scent. I have no comparison as this is the first cellulite cream I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note this is not a combo set, it&#x27;s just the lotion. The massager needs to be purchased separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how well it works against cellulite as I haven&#x27;t worked it into my daily routine; 15 minutes per leg.</li>
    <li> I love it! It makes your skin feel really good and you quickly start to see results. It also smells really good.</li>
    <li> I like this spray cellulite cream because it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, it was made in the USA, and it really works besides not being tested on animals. It arrived quickly and packaged well and it works well no problem with the pump or anything. It goes on smooth and seems to be tightening the loose skin on my tummy from weight lose. I would recommend this cream to anyone who is looking to get rid of cellulite of tighten some loose skin. Thank you</li>
    <li> Perfect for after my 2 kids.  They have lighten up very nice</li>
    <li> I was pretty skeptical using this product since I know that no product can remove cellulite. After trying it for a few days, I&#x27;m noticing my legs actually look healthier. It smells amazing too!</li>
    <li> Well,I have tried many different &amp;#34;cellulite&amp;#34; products in the past and this one seems to be working so far.my skin seems to be much more hydrated,as well as softer and smoother.i will continue to use,thanks</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love that this product is in a spray bottle.  It sprays a nice light coat so my skin doesn&#x27;t feel overwhelmed by product.  I just started using it, but I love that it is made in the USA.  I am confident that I will see a difference over the coming weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days and I&#x27;m already seeing results. It smells amazing and they don&#x27;t test on animals. Great product! !!</li>
    <li> Love this cream! Great scent and leaves my skin feeling smooth... Works great with cellulite massager :-)</li>
    <li> This is the first using this so I love it been testing out for a few days and loving it. Planning on buying more of it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 4 days now and i am liking this very much. Its not sticky and doesnt leave any residue. Its smooth and its beginning to do its work.</li>
    <li> I use this product in conjunction with a moderate carb and sugar free diet. My weight has fluctuated between the same 30 pounds for most of my adult life. Because of this, I have areas of loose skin. This product tightens them up visibly. It has a pleasant scent and the pump makes it go on quickly. It&#x27;s moisturizing and makes your skin breathe. I recommend that you use it liberally following a bath. I love that it&#x27;s made in the USA and not tested on animals. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> YES YES YES. Finally! I&#x27;ve been searching for a cellulite cream that WORKS! This is not oily and goes on easily. The packaging is simple and sleek and has a pump to receive the product. I have the hand held roller that I use after applying to really get in the fat and muscle &#x3D;) LOVE THIS thank you!</li>
    <li> I use this along with a massager and the results are incredible</li>
    <li> product has a nice aroma.  noticed a bit more of a hydrated skin tone appearance versus other cellulite creams that I have tried, which tended to be a little more drying of the skin.  didn&#x27;t notice a tingling/heating sensation either as i have with some other creams.  convenient size for traveling and i liked that it had a pump.</li>
    <li> It was easy to use. Felt smooth on my skin. Brighten my skin up.</li>
    <li> I am a skeptic toward all things that magically work on fat or cellulite, but with a nice discount coupon, I gave it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it comes in a pump. I spread it on my cellulite regularly according to the instructions. While nothing can remove cellulite short of liposuction, this rich, moisturizing cream&#x27;s ability to increase elasticity and moisture retention definitely improved its appearance.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really see much difference until about three weeks of constant use, but I took pictures (which no one will EVER see!) before and after for corroboration, and I really did see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream feels and smells wonderful, and I&#x27;m sure that encourages enthusiastic application, which may help break up cellulite bunches. I think it has caffeine in it because after the first few uses, there is a sense of tightening of the skin, but without the drying effects I had come to expect from such products.</li>
    <li> I just started using this one. It didn&#x27;t show any results first. It has coconut-vanilla smell - not my husband&#x27;s favorite. Though I should say that the skin is soft and it might work - I just should keep using this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks so far and decided to share my thoughts. This cream smells amazing, a nice coconutty sunscreen scent, and this is saying a lot for me since I don&#x27;t generally like coconut scents. The pump on the product is easy to use and releases minimal product so nothing will go to waste. As to the performance of the product, I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s decreased the appearance of my cellulite, but my legs do feel slightly more firm and that&#x27;s what I like about it. I feel that with continued use I might actually see a decrease in cellulite, but so far I&#x27;m more than happy with the firmer feel of my legs. I don&#x27;t think this is a viable alternative to exercise and natural methods of losing weight, but I believe that using this in conjunction with a good diet and exercise will result in great results. Overall, I would recommend this product but just know that it takes time to work and it won&#x27;t work completely on its own. Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> im feeling so much smoother! love this product! highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for my back thigh area. I have seen the difference in appearance back there.It firms up my skin and it feels firm too.I took a before and present picture and it sure does work. If you are looking to get those&lt;br /&gt;problem areas tightened I recommend you try this first. I use it everyday in the morning and at night after I shower. Great size too I only need about 2 or 3 pumps per leg. Great cellulite cream!</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s great about Queen Simonida Cellulite Cream Is it is 100% Paraben Free!!!!  Parabens are easily absorbed ...and can contribute to Cancer and Hormonal Imbalances.  Queen  Simonida Stimulates the Lymphatic System ...  Activates Blood Circulation and  Contributes to the Elimination of Cellulite!  There are so many benefits to this product ...I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Received this item a few days ago. It has a nice clean scent, is silky and not sticky like some lotions.  Works great with the messaged.</li>
    <li> Many who know me, knows that i&#x27;m a skeptic when it comes to these types of things, but I seen it and I said it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try and I am really glad I did because I definitely have seen improvement in the short time that I have been using it!!!! excited to see the end results :)</li>
    <li> I got this because as I have aged I have noticed more problems with my skin.  The very first thing that I liked about this is that it is Paraben Free!  I have dealt with close friends recently and cancer so this made it extremely important to me!  I also appreciated the fact that it is made in the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;i have bought several different products like this recently, but I liked this one the best!  It doesn&#x27;t go on thin and runny, it has a nice thick texture to it.  I have been using it for several days now, and am anxious to see continued results.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday and after a few days I&#x27;m seeing a difference. As we know we notice our cellulite before other people do and you will be the first to notice the difference. Love this product. It makes me feel more confident in wearing shorts and a short skirt!</li>
    <li> I received the Best Cellulite Cream on the correct delivery date.  The cream has a nice smell and goes into your skin very easy.  Looking forward to using for a while to see what the results will be in the future.</li>
    <li> I have to admit I didn&#x27;t expect a lot from this but was hopeful.  But boy was I pleasantly surprised!  It goes on like silk and leaves the skin super soft for hours - enough that my husband noticed - and I can already see less dimpling in my thighs.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> great product...only been using it for fews days and I already see results. Very easy to apply on and smells great which is also a plus :-)</li>
    <li> Just started this product, and loving it so far! LOVE that it comes in a spray, so its easy to apply and not greasy! I gained alot of weight in my stomach and thighs after having my daughter and definitely need some tightening up in those areas, and so far so good!  I did receive this product at a reduced rate to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I have been in the hunt for a good cellulite cream for a long time now and I finally found it&lt;br /&gt;This is a thin formula very nice and soft cream easy to blend into the skin and due to it being very light. Because of the formula a little goes a long way and it smells delicious too&lt;br /&gt;It is better to use with a massager because it helps distribute the product and active the circulation so it works faster.&lt;br /&gt;In a short time you can see the difference I recommend it</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that I really prefer this pump action bottle to the scoop out creams that I have tried. I think it keeps things a whole lot neater. My skin does feel tighter in the areas that I have applied it and the cream itself has a mild scent. I likght how the cream has a real light non-greasy feel to it.I also purchased the massager brush mitt to go along with this cream and I love it. It really helps work the cream into the body.</li>
    <li> Very smoothing and smells good. Gets rid of the visible cellulite you have on your body. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It is so great. I used it a cole times and after massaging a couple times I feel like my stomach is tighter and some of the marks are starting to fade away some. If you have a chance to check it out with cellulite it is worth trying.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product long at all mostly used on my legs but I have notice a little of a difference... as I continue to use it the more the cellulite seems to be disappear.</li>
    <li> This cream comes in a spray bottle and has a nice scent to it. I like that it is Paraben free, made in the USA and not tested on animals.  I have not been using it for to long but so far it seems to be working good. I notice the skin on my thighs and arms getting a little tighter already. I will definately be recommending this product to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT. I have been rubbing daily on my stomach and its soft and getting smoothe!  Smells good too!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me.  I&#x27;m going back to another product I found on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Instantly could feel this product working it&#x27;s magic! It smells really good and it has a nice feel to it, not greasy and sticky like similar products. Within a few minutes I could feel it drying and my skin tightening along with it. After a few days I noticed the areas I applied it were visibly firmer, my husband noticed to and he had no idea I was using it! Love it, will buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting on this and I love love love it it&#x27;s kinda like magic if I wasn&#x27;t shy I&#x27;d take pics this is my go to product from now on!!</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff!!! I have 4 kids so believe me I know how embarrassing it his to have streak marks.  I have tried so many thing an spent so much money only to find out none of it worked.  I thought at this great price id give it a try, an It works yay.  I really can just put it one in the morning an have no worries.  I go to the gym an my clothes slide all around an shows my skin ( which sucks ) but this cream makes it look all smoothed out. It really works an now I have to put it on everyday lol. When I look in the mirror no more sunk in skin an red marks. It just smooths an  fills it all in an away.  Super glad I gave it a try. Now Im a permanent customer</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream off and on for a week. I have problem areas ( doesn&#x27;t everyone??) and getting older , well, cellulite comes with the territory. i have so far been liking this product. It&#x27;s interesting that it is a spray type lotion; it absorbs very quickly and does not feel greasy or slimy. I can get dressed immediately after application whereas some lotions are quite thick and wet feeling. This also has a lovely smell. I can see a difference in the area behind my thighs..my skin feels tighter. Having never used cellulite cream before, I can safely say that this one works!</li>
    <li> Smells great and feel just as good.  Easy to apply and does not irritate my skin at all!!</li>
    <li> The only complaint is I didn&#x27;t order enough !!! I love everything about this product !! 1st I love the fact that it&#x27;s is Paraben free ,animal friendly and made in the USA of the absolute best ingredients !! 2nd the texture and the smell are sooo great ! 3rd this cream leaves your skin feeling great !! It made a noticeable difference !! &amp;lt;3 &amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> really works well.  doesnt seem greasy so its great to use right before bed so you dont have that greasy feeling when you sleep</li>
    <li> This really is the best cellulite cream. I can already see the cottage cheese disappearing. Ugh.. I was so stressed over it but now I&#x27;m happy . Has a pleasant smell. Which is a plus</li>
    <li> I just started using this Cellulite Cream about 2 weeks ago and I can already tell a difference on my legs especially. I guess that is my main problem area. It leaves your skin feeling softer and tighter, Has a great smell to it and easy to apply. I will definitely recommend this to all my friends and family or to any one who is looking for a great defying product that works. THANKS</li>
    <li> I got this product for free for my unbias and honest opinion.  I am a 48 year old woman, mother of three boys and i do have cellulite on the back of my theighs just  a couple of spots not big spots its just beginning! I put the cellulite cream on before i go to bed message it in and looks like its getting fewer and fewer spots. I like the scent and the creaminess of the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product a few days, and I&#x27;m already seeing results!! I have used it on the back of my legs and buttocks. It&#x27;s so easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. My skin is smoother and less ripply in appearance. I recommend using it with the massage applicator that can be purchased separately.It helps to massage the cream in better.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this!! I can notice such a difference in the short time I have been using it! I can&#x27;t wait to finish this bottle to see the amazing results!!</li>
    <li> I love this Cellulite cream. This product comes in a spray bottle which is a huge plus for me because it doesn&#x27;t go on too thick. It has a pleasant smell and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy. I have been using it for a few days and my skin does feel smoother and firmer. I can&#x27;t wait to keep using it and see the results. I recommend it for anyone looking for a good cellulite cream.</li>
    <li> This is a nice cream with a pretty amazing beachy coconut like scent. I have been using it for about a week and haven&#x27;t noticed anything yet, but I honestly didn&#x27;t expect anything so soon. I apply about 3-4 pumps to each thigh and it is nice and smooth.  It does not have a burning or icy sensation upon application and may be something you may want to try  if you are sensitive to the other creams that tend to have the burning or icy feeling.</li>
    <li> Love that the bottle is not over sized and it is a spray not a cream. I am not a fan of products that I have to get all over my hands. This spray works like a gem! Have been using for about two weeks and can see a slight difference in the thighs and hips. The smell is nice without being overbearing. Works great with a hand massage and leaves my skin feeling moisturized! A few sprays go a long way once you use a massage roller. You can rub in with fingers first if you wish.</li>
    <li> great product, nice scent</li>
    <li> I gave it as a gift to my aunt and she said the product works well on her cellulite. She has used it for just over a week and says that her problem area- thighs seem a bit tighter but she is going to continue using it and update me. She also likes the fact that it is non greasy and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t purchase products like this, but as I am getting older I have noticed I needed something to help tighten my skin. I have only been using this product for a short time but I can see a big difference! I use it on my stomach and my upper legs. It has a light scent and comes in a spray bottle which makes it convenient to use. This product works great and I highly recommend it to anyone who has problems with lose skin!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! My skin has definitely changed as I&#x27;ve gotten older so cellulite just comes with the territory. At first I was skeptical but after a week of use I immediately noticed a difference in my skin. Tighter, smoother, and firmer in all my target areas (buttocks and thighs). I have an acute sense of smell and I have noticed it has a light, clean fragrance and it goes on great with easy absorbance and little residue. I love the packaging and that is has a spray nozzle which make usage easy. I highly recommend this product and will be purchasing another one when this one runs out.</li>
    <li> I have lost some weight and the appearance of my skin as I have gotten older, needs some improvement. I seen this product and at first was sceptical and then decided to give it a try. I have been using this for about a week now. I use it every time I get out of the shower, which is every day. I have noticed that it has made my skin tighter and firmer in my thigh area and the back of my legs. It has a light pleasant scent which is nice too. I know that the more I continue to use this cream the more and more results I will get. So looking forward to more beautiful supple skin.</li>
    <li> Being a healthy individual who engages in healthy living I&#x27;m, unfortunately, cursed with some cellulite. I am glad I was offered to receive this product for evaluation purpose in return for an honest and unbiased review. As soon as I opened the jar I fall in love with this product! Smells good, this scent is not overpowering, it is very soothing and relaxing. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks and can see it’s slowly helping. I only use it during the day, putting it on my stomach, legs and upper arms after my morning shower and massaging it in for a minute or so.  This cream is very light and easy to apply; it goes on quickly and smoothly, making it easy to follow the directions and apply in a circular motion. My skin smells good; it is hydrated, not greasy, and just &#x27;tightened up&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy, once again my skin looks smooth, and the appearance of cellulite is less noticeable. I had stretch marks on my stomach and this cream made them fade. I didn&#x27;t think that was possible any more. This product is doing a fairly good job and the improvement can be seen. I think as time progresses and a few more weeks I&#x27;ll be able to notice more results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In combination with working out and eating right it really is a miracle product for firming that last bit of loose skin. Don&#x27;t be discouraged if one jar doesn&#x27;t give you a huge appearance of diminished cellulite because everyone&#x27;s bodies are different. Some people have it easy and can get this fixed with one jar while others need to buy more than one. Regardless of how long it takes, this stuff does actually work and with consistency, you can get to where you want to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation purposes, my review is based on my experience with the product which may differ from yours.</li>
    <li> This product works great. My legs look in better shape after trying this product. This is not greasy. It smells good. It comes in a pump not a wipe in cream. This is not tested on animals and it is made in USA.</li>
    <li> Easy pump spray action.  I just spray on my thighs and leave it.  I am noticing the &amp;#34;dimples&amp;#34; on my thighs are disappearing. Seems like my skin is tightening. The smell is good and very easy to use!</li>
    <li> Must say it sure gives me the feeling of working.&lt;br /&gt;Just me being inpatient.</li>
    <li> My body says Thank You!!!!  Noticeable changes in viewing my cellulite.  Definitely making the cellulite dissolve. Skin feels tighter as well. Feels as though my skin is actually detoxifying.  Much needed :) Fast shipping and arrived in great form.</li>
    <li> I am loving this cream. Been using it for a few days now and my skin feels much smoother and firmer. It has a very light pleasant scent. I will continue using this effective product to see even more great results. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> By far the BEST cellulite cream available.  Combine this with the massager brush and you will NOT be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> The cream has a nice smell to it unlike many other creams I&#x27;ve seen.  The bottle is easy to use and is almost in the form of a spray bottle.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and smoother than before.  I have only been using this  cream for a short time, but I can&#x27;t wait to continue to use and see the results.</li>
    <li> This actually works I cant believe it. My legs look great. I will keep buying.</li>
    <li> Ive been using the cream daily as stated on the packaging and to be honest i have not seen a difference.  The cellulite in my leg looks the same as before i started. I use this cream in conjunction with working out on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it everyday but do not seen any improvements to cellulite.</li>
    <li> Totally like this produt it works like magic I fell that my cellulite is all gon thanks again</li>
    <li> Smells the best out of any cellulite cream I have ever used.  The lotion leaves my skin silky soft and I have already noticed an improvement in my cellulite.  I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> It was very hard to get out.. I needed too open the bottle. It was not enough to make a difference.</li>
    <li> I think this cream really works and I was skeptical at the beginning .But after 3-4 weeks I definitely see less &amp;#34;dimples&amp;#34; on my legs .And it&#x27;s smell so nice !</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a bit of difference. Looks and feels like regular lotion. Definitely don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Stinks!!! Ugh but it fades not sticks around forever as w self tanners that you have to bathe good to remove the smell. I go to bed w it on and smell is gone the next morning. Don&#x27;t have to re-shower.&lt;br /&gt;As far as results, I&#x27;ve used it religiously for well over a month and Ive not noticed any decrease in cellulite. My skin does feel softer though to the touch. But no real disappearance of cellulite. Maybe it just takes allot of exsersize no Miracle in a bottle!</li>
    <li> My skin feels tighter and more rejuvenated! I really know this product works after using it a while! I want to stay looking my youngest for my husband and this is a tool under my belt! It&#x27;s almost like you can feel it working into your skin! It has helped me not show my age! I would recommend to anyone looking to tighten and firm your skin!</li>
    <li> I bought this to firm up my buttocks and thighs, and it seems to actually do the job. My skin feels much firmer after I use this, and the smell is quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;This product was received for the purpose of testing and  review.</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for a few days now and can already see that my thighs are starting to look less bumpy. i will defintaly continue on using this, and hope for even better results</li>
    <li> This spray on cream is the best! It is so much easier to apply and the smell is not overbearing. I after having 2 babies I went from 120 to 200 in such a short period of time and I am seeing cellulite like no other.  I am seeing a a difference after using this cellulite cream.  I love the fact that it is paraben free.</li>
    <li> Leaves your feeling softer , firmer, and tighter, Has a great smell to it ! Easy to apply , Would recommend to any one who is looking  for a great defying product .</li>
    <li> Not bad but not a miracle cream either..</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was doing wrong, but I did not see any improvement on the appearance of my cellulite by the time I had used up the whole bottle.</li>
    <li> Great product! And together with the brush it works even better!</li>
    <li> Cream goes on smooth and it smells good. Ive been using this for about a month, and noticed that my thighes look smoother. Granted nothing but excersice or surgery will remove all cellulite.</li>
    <li> This product has a nice sweet smell that&#x27;s not super strong and does a good job at reducing the site of cellulite on my thighs. It makes them look significantly better I am very happy with this product. I will now add this into my routine along with diet and exercise to get rid of these unsightly thunder thighs. Nice to have something to make them not look so bad in the process.</li>
    <li> I got this in the mail a few days ago and use it after I get out of the shower.  The smell is not over powering - light, clean and crisp.  After several days I have already noticed an improvement in the dimpling.  I am so excited to use this product and plan to get more!</li>
    <li> perfect bottle pump.  I like the cellulite cream, it does apply just like a good moisturizer without waxy feeling.  This very comfortable to wear.  I have a big issue with cellulite so it will take some time to see long term result. though, i am very positive with it.</li>
    <li> i have had significant improvement after using this product. my legs look much better after my &amp;#34;fat Dimples&amp;#34; are going away :-)</li>
    <li> I am just now starting to notice a bit of cellulite on my thighs, which is upsetting as in my younger days I have very nice firm and nice looking legs. But as my age has progressed, so has the cellulite. I am hoping that I am attempting to repair or reverse the damage just in time, before it gets too bad. The Simonida&#x27;s Caffeine Cream Cellulite is the first I have ever tried and I think I picked a good one! It has only been about a week, but I can already see some firming of the skin in my thighs, and I like that it does not have an overpowering odor, as my husband has a very sensitive nose, and would not be able to stand it if I got in bed with strong smelling creams. I use it nightly after my shower and before bed. I cannot wait to see the long term effects. I received this product for free in exchange for a review, but all opinions expressed are solely my own.</li>
    <li> Most annoying company in the world. They&#x27;ll hound you to death for a good review, even after you&#x27;ve told them you didn&#x27;t use their cream, gave it away as a gift and don&#x27;t want to hear from them another dozen times.</li>
    <li> I am not sure this product works long term, but seems to be effective immediately.</li>
    <li> The only proudct works for me.i see the result after 2 week.love it.i just recommended to all my family and friends. Thank You.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product and I&#x27;m sad to say it does not work as I expected, but I guess I can&#x27;t expect a miracle in a pump...The cream is light and spreads easily, it does make your skin soft but unfortunately after 1 month of use I don&#x27;t see the slightest difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunatley I will not buy this again and will stick to my excersise and diet.</li>
</ol>
