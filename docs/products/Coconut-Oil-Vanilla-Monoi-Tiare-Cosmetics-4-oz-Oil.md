<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wife says this works as it should and she is happy with everthing about it except the cost....</li>
    <li> I liked the idea of this but didn&#x27;t find a way to make use of it.</li>
    <li> As described. Very good</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing! I use it when I get out of the shower. It absorbs fairly quick, and the scent lasts all day. My cat also likes to lick my legs and arms when I&#x27;ve applied it, so she approves too.</li>
    <li> fast service! I use this oil on my hair, face, and body. It&#x27;s great for dry skin. I recommend this seller highly!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used vanilla products in one form or another for many years. This formulation doesn&#x27;t appeal to me. The Gardenia product is much better.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing and smells amazing... I have a terrible, completely by accident, sunburn and this stuff is keeping my skin so amazingly moist. Anyone who has ever been sunburned knows how dry and parched your skin gets, seriously nothing helps like this stuff. And the smell oh my goodness one word yum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did solidify in my house last night with the AC on but I took it in the shower with me as another reviewer suggested and ran it under hot water and bam it was liquid again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a real vanilla bean in the bottom so don&#x27;t be surprised by the black stuff floating it is all natural goodness!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice. A little to Vanilla smelling for my taste, but it does make my skin very smooth.</li>
    <li> Beware .. you can&#x27;t eat this .. smells like you should be able too and skin feels soft little goes along way</li>
    <li> Intoxicating smell! I love it!</li>
    <li> This product is okay but I don&#x27;t care for the smell.  Too vanilla in my opinion.  I use it but only to use it up.  I won&#x27;t re-purchase it.</li>
    <li> Love the hint of vanilla</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance, uses it in the bath all the time. It moisturizers your skin, makes it soft. I need to replenish my order</li>
    <li> Do not buy from this seller.  Product appeared old.  The oil/lotion was completely solid and stuck in container.  There also appeared to be mold in the container.</li>
    <li> Have to melt it to use.</li>
    <li> Coconut oil has some wonderful properties that make it perfect for skin. The protein in the oil is similar to the proteins in human skin, so the oil is more easily absorbed and used by the skin. Coconut oil has natural antiseptic properties, too, so it is often used for a variety of health purposes. In the past, I have had difficulty finding an oil for my skin that had a high percentage of coconut in it. Monoi Tiare has ended my search. I&#x27;ve been using this oil for about a week now, and there has been a marked improvement in my skin, which is now much softer and smoother. My hands get rough and dry in the winter, and the improvement has been surprising. I had a couple of rough, red patches on my arms, and they are completely gone. My feet and knees are also much better. I&#x27;m really impressed with what regular use has done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially love the scent of this oil, which reminds me of marshmallows. Although the oil has a strong scent right out of the bottle, the scent dissipates fairly quickly, leaving behind just a hint on the skin that is quite pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important to note that ALL coconut oil is solid at temperatures below about 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Thus, you have to warm this product if it is stored at temperatures below 70 degrees Fahrenheit. This is easily done, though, by placing the bottle under or in warm water, or near a heating source, like a floor vent or baseboard heater. The oil quickly liquefies as it warms, and is easily poured and spread over skin.</li>
    <li> Love this Monoi oil!! I use it on my hair and skin everyday best natural moisturizer</li>
    <li> this is the best skin product i&#x27;ve tried so far. i put it in a spray bottle and solved the issue of oil coming out too much or too fast.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the purchase.  I need a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> This smells heavenly and melts on your skin. It does solidify in cool temps.</li>
    <li> The smell of this stuff is just amazing. Seller was fast unlike another on here that sells the same item. Will be a regular buyer.</li>
    <li> I liked it, its not always liquid depending on the temperature you have it. I wish it would have more essence because I really like to smell Vanilla and for me just its jut not enough.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to try this. Love the smell and the oil absorbs great into my skin. Only drawback, and I&#x27;m not sure if this happens with every bottle, is that the oil hardened inside the bottle. I have to run it under hot tap water to melt the chunk of oil. Not sure whats up with that but I am not using it up as fast as I probably would if it stayed pure oil.</li>
    <li> Nice smell.  Very light and even the fiancé enjoyed putting some on himself.  It is an oil so it will be on your skin for a while but I still enjoy the summer smell of it and know it is doing good for my skin.</li>
    <li> Great for wintertime!  I put this on before bed and I woke up smelling like cake.  I hesitate to say that because so many synthetic, mass-market, teenager-oriented fragrances have come out with \\&quot;buttercream frosting\\&quot; and \\&quot;birthday cake\\&quot; as flavors (gag), but this actually does smell like real, edible, lovely vanilla.  YUM.  I&#x27;m curious to try the others now.&lt;br /&gt;[[ unfortunately, the seller I purchased this from put a giant ugly barcode sticker across the back label (ingredients, etc.) that was impossible to remove, so I wasn&#x27;t able to give this as a gift.  Amazon was great about giving me a prompt refund, though. ]]</li>
    <li> Great scent! Very moisturizing</li>
    <li> Smells great and feels great on skin but very hard to get out of the bottle when the coconut oil solidifies.  It would work better in a jar.</li>
    <li> Smells good. Turns solid in cooler temps. Returns to liquid once warmed. Looks a little weird when first get it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. The smell is AMAZING. It smells like baked vanilla coconut treats, and lingers for awhile (not strong or overpowering even on initial application, just yummy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is very moisturizing and sinks in quickly. It&#x27;ll only feel greasy if you use too much product. I prefer it to &#x27;regular&#x27; extra virgin coconut oil because it seems to go on smoother for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The packaging leaves something to be desired - when you first get it, it has this inner lid thing that has to be removed- it&#x27;s hard to remove/not get stuck inside the bottle. It has a screw top lid and I really wish it had a flip top lid instead. I&#x27;ve almost tipped and spilled the whole thing mid application many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is more expensive than plain coconut oil but definitely worth it. A very luxurious product.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. The particles of monoi oil are smaller than other types of oil, so it soaks into your skin/hair. The smell is warm and light, with a vanilla marshmallow scent. I use this on my body immediately after a shower, as well as in my hair (I have dry, wavy red hair). It makes your hair soo soft and shiny, but don&#x27;t overdo it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this on my face at night after I apply my retinol cream, and fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes have plumped and decreased. My skin is naturally SUPER oily, and though it seems counter-intuitive to use oil on my face, it actually helps my skin to not be as oily. I have only used this at night, not under makeup, so I can&#x27;t vouch for the results of how my skin would react as a day moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true that the oil solidifies in cooler temperatures, but instructions for dealing with this (a common issue with coconut based oils)  are written on the back of the bottle. I can&#x27;t believe one reviewer threw their bottle away due to this! Don&#x27;t waste it, ding dong!!! This stuff is like the holy grail of multi-purpose moisturizers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have is that the bottle design causes the oil to come out all at once, but at the same time, I absolutely love this retro-style label. It&#x27;s like 60&#x27;s style Hawaiian kitsch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An inexpensive, wonderful product, I would recommend this brand of manoi oil to absolutely anyone!</li>
    <li> excellent.  awesome scent!</li>
    <li> I agree with pretty much everyone else stated about this oil.  It smells DIVINE, I mean so delicious.  It does turn semi-solid when left in a cold environment but by the time I am done showering, it has melted enough for application (I hjave not had to soak it in water yet).  The oil does leave your skin feeling silky smooth, I will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> as described.. price ok but i found it even cheaper;) im very happy with the product i have very curly biracial hair and my hair has been thirsting for monoi!!! it literally sucks it up and it does not make my hair oily at all i have never experienced any other oil that worked like this. coconut oil is really the best oil for curly hair. My mom uses it too but only sparingly because it WILL make her straight thick hair oily! so i guess its all about hair texture. its fantastic on the skin too!</li>
    <li> I use itmore for my hair. It grows so well and longer than I could ever grow it with pomade</li>
    <li> Product packaging was perfect. Received in timely fashion. Love love the product. Smells delicious and goes on great.  Must be kept above 68 though or must rinse bottle in warm water to get lotion out of the bottle</li>
    <li> I love coconut oil, I never thought it could get any better...until I found this. The smell is fantastic and like all coconut oil nourishes your skin leaving it soft and moisturized. I even like putting a bit on the ends of my hair.</li>
    <li> This has a great scent and I love it for my bare legs with shorts or a dress.  I will order more and maybe try another scent.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s sweet, strong, and highly-concentrated.  You can actually see a bit of vanilla bean in the bottle, infusing the oil.  A little goes a long way.  Even a drop on my palms after a shower is enough to perfume my hair, which is long and thick.  There is one detractor:  the packaging.  It&#x27;s a completely open bottle neck and allows the oil to spill out too fast, which is a tricky thing, considering the fact that the bottle will naturally get slippery.  You have to be very careful when dispensing it so not to waste precious vanilla oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it yesterday to help scent a batch of homemade deodorant.  It worked beautifully.  Just a few drops moistened the batch and serve as a natural perfume.</li>
    <li> so awesome. Made my hair smell so wonderful, and the smell last ALL DAY.  And to the reviews saying it was solid. Well duh it coconut oil. Coconut oil when cold become solid. But the melt very fast. LOVEEEER THIS OIL.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
    <li> I have very dry, curly hair. I washed my hair, used this alone while my hair was wet, and when it dried, my hair felt moisturized still and it smelled great! Haven&#x27;t tried it on my skin yet, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great. I&#x27;m not a fan of vanilla usually, but, I like this! :)</li>
    <li> It does make you skin super silky and  soft. Smells good. A little pricey and doesn&#x27;t last very long. Overall okay.</li>
    <li> This product is AWFUL.  It comes solidified - not a liquid - and if I want to use it?  I have to &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; it in hot water for 15 mins first.  Terrible!  I wish it was as promised - an OIL.  That would be awesome, but it&#x27;s another FAIL in my book.</li>
    <li> The divine arroma that greets the senses when using this product is enough to love it, but the good old standard of coconut oil that is useful for all dryness that ails mankind makes this a very unique product to use.  I will order this again.  I also saw they make the product with sandalwood-delightful possibilities.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this oil!! it smells like yummy and it has a warm aroma to it. Very lovely and tropical oil and I recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing! I like to apply it out of the shower on slightly damp skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time, I will get another scent. The vanilla was a bit too strong for my personal taste.</li>
    <li> Was not what I expected.  Not very good. Hardly any smell to it.</li>
    <li> This oil smells so good that I want to eat it!! I&#x27;ve been using it on the ends of my hair and i have absolutely noticed an increase in shine and softness. I&#x27;ve also tried it on the back of my arms where I often get keratin pilaris (bumps). Surprisingly, this has helped with that too and I&#x27;ve been using it every night. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Love this oil. Smell so good.</li>
    <li> I am a dude and I&#x27;m obsessed with this stuff. Picked it up in Bora-Bora and can&#x27;t get enough of it.  After shower I use it on my entire body, including face and a bit in the hair.  The smell is intoxicating and it just makes my skin feel great.  I also love just using regular coconut oil, which is a lot cheaper, but the Monoi vanilla smell is out of this world.</li>
    <li> WOW! I adore this product so much!&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely, dry skin, especially during harsh winter months up here in the Northwest.  After I get out of the shower I rub this oil all over my skin, especially dry elbows, knees and feet and WOW! Within minutes my skin absorbs this yummy, vanilla, scented oil and I feel so soft and healthy! It is magic in a bottle! And the vanilla scent will last for hours which I personally love! I will definitely be buying another one of these once mine runs out.  I bought it in September and I have about half a bottle left, another plus, a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Lovely Oil. Difficulty to pour without pouring too much or drip, and narrow circumference of bottle bottom, but very aromatic oil for the hair.</li>
    <li> A friend gave me a bottle of this.  I&#x27;m not a fan of vanilla scents in general but this is different, not fake smelling.  But the main thing is it is literally the best thing I&#x27;ve put on my hair ever.  Rubbed into the scalp, hair,, especially the ends, and then shampooed out, it leaves my hair incredibly soft.  I don&#x27;t use it daily, I think it might get heavy after a while, but when my hair feels dry, this perks it up. awesome stuff.  Can&#x27;t wait to try a different scent.</li>
    <li> While really moisturizing, it doesn&#x27;t sink in quite as fast as some of the reviews allege. I used it sparingly on damp skin, and it took several minutes. While it smells decent, I also wouldn&#x27;t rave about it as far as that goes. I don&#x27;t smell anything other than a somewhat odd vanilla, and it&#x27;s faint. Since scent preference is subjective, others might like it. I work with scents and am pretty picky. That is why I gave it four stars instead of five. That, and the shipping could have been somewhat faster. I will either make my own, or try the sandalwood next time.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;m always searching for body lotions, oils, scrubs. The bottle isn&#x27;t very large (4oz), and it&#x27;s almost thick in the bottle - but when you squeeze a bit into your hands and rub, your body heat turns it into oil and you&#x27;re ready to go! At first I had a hard time judging how much to squeeze out. Too much and it&#x27;s oil city. After 1 use I had the amount down pat and found it to be amazing! It wasn&#x27;t greasy (except where I applied too much), absorbed pretty quick &amp; I loved the vanilla scent!!!! Very sweet &amp; soft. But not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t worry about the weird lump in the bottle either. - it&#x27;s a flower!</li>
    <li> I like how it feels on skin and helps condition my hair. I leave it in my hair and then rinse it out. Overnight is best.</li>
    <li> You smell as sweet as vanilla all day long. And I believe that since it is pure vanilla it keeps unwanted bugs away</li>
    <li> The scent is light  and lovely, not overwhelming. The feel of the oil is also light and moisturizing, it isn&#x27;t greasy. Perfect for everyday use on the skin and hair.</li>
    <li> I was surprised by all the reviews for a great hair product. I barely used any on my hair and it made it look so oily and it weighed it down. Perhaps I need to blow-dry my hair which I don&#x27;t do. The smell is great but doesn&#x27;t last all day or 1/2 day. I have to put it on my clothes for it to smell the whole day and who wants oil on their clothes? Yes, it does leave skin soft if using after your shower but that was not the reason for my purchase.</li>
    <li> I use this almost every night. It&#x27;s soooo luxurious and smells amazing. Not greasy feeling. Feels summery and beachy. If you like those kind of smells and like intense hydration--buy this. It&#x27;s wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: It needs to be warm (68 degrees, apparently) to be liquid form. Otherwise it&#x27;s solid--you can squeeze it out if you have enough in the bottle, or run it under warm water to emulsify the oil. In the summer months it should be liquid all the time.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Was worried about how it would smell but coconut and vanilla, how could you go wrong? It smells great!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in the quality of this product . I would not recommend this product to anyone. It&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Everyone seems to use this in different ways.  I like to use it on my arms after I shower.  The coconut smell actually lingers on ALL day...very subtly.  I enjoy catching the scent every once in a while throughout the day.  And it does seem to smooth my skin nicely.  It&#x27;s not terribly greasy, but don&#x27;t expect it to soak in like lotion.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I wanted.  Received it in perfect condition.  I use this product to make my own body scrub because the vanilla smell is amazing.</li>
    <li> Nice on your skin, Goes solid if not at room temperature.  It might be better in a jar,  because it is easier to get to if it goes solid.</li>
    <li> smell soo good and sweet. and received my order in 2 days!!! ♥♥ This product does deliver and it has a real vanilla bean in the oil so that the oil is infused with Vanilla. makes you want to eat it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Smells amazing and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
    <li> Beautiful product, smell is lovely, absorbs well, leaves skin smooth and helps promote a bronze tan!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and smells good...but the bottle cap was loose when the shipment arrived.  The bottle isn&#x27;t sealed for safety, so oil leaked everywhere.</li>
    <li> This oil smells so good and I have to keep ordering it for me and my wife. I use it on my hair and skin. Going to order 4 more bottles to keep a large stock.</li>
    <li> I know this is just coconut oil with Gardenia and vanilla essential oil in it, but it smells wonderful. I&#x27;m so glad I ordered it. Please remember that this is coconut oil, so it becomes a solid when the temp drops. I just fill my bathroom sink with hot water and toss the closed bottle into the water and within a few minutes, I have a liquid that I can easily work with. I put it in my hair and use it like a lotion on my body.</li>
    <li> I just luv the smell and the way it makes my skin feel,,, It comes right away I didn&#x27;t have to wait long for it to appear in my mailbox</li>
    <li> MY HAIR IS LEFT VERY SOFT.  NOT OVERLY OILED, AND THE SWEET SMELL IS GREAT!!!!!  I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANY ONE WHO WANTS TO HAVE SHINNIER  AND HEALTHIER LONG TRESSES.</li>
    <li> addicted to this stuff, as others have stated just put in the shower with you to let it warm up and application is a breeze!</li>
    <li> This oil has a nice soft/warm scent.  The bottle label does warn that the oil gets hard due to its natural ingredients.  That&#x27;s a bit of a nuisance if I get out the shower and forget to heat the bottle first.</li>
    <li> This is a small bottle and you have to be very careful pouring it out or you will end up with way to much. It only takes a small amount.it makes your skin soft and smell nice.</li>
    <li> I rubbed a little on my dry ends of hair and in my hands. It is powerful enough to substitute for perfume. It&#x27;s a nice option in the bathroom to have a scented oil for dry skin and hair. I wouldn&#x27;t use it every day</li>
    <li> I like the oil. I was kind of taken back when it would harden inside the bottle but then I read some reviews and realized that was the norm. The smell is nice and it helps to soften my hair. I&#x27;ll be keeping it around.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells screamin&#x27;, I like to use it after a shower or bath, it&#x27;s  vey nice.  My only complaints are that it&#x27;s a heavier oil then I expected and I&#x27;ve found that I can&#x27;t put it on my chest because it kinda made me break out - also - I the scent fades away kinda quick for my taste, wish it would linger on the skin more (&#x27;cause it smells so nice).</li>
    <li> Great oil to use on frizzy ends of hair. Lifhtweight</li>
    <li> Sweet,smell very good.</li>
    <li> Amazing scent! and super moisturizing for my hair and nails, a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I wear this oil on the beach,and after a shower as a moisturizer.The scent is so yummy that I dab it on my neck as a cologne.My boyfriend likes it in his hair and it leaves his hair silky smooth.I would recommend this oil to all my friends.Its THAT GOOD!</li>
    <li> This is fantastic and smells heavenly! I can&#x27;t live without it now. My skin and hair feel so nice.</li>
    <li> Everyone said what is that smell?&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is awesome. I use it on my face after I wash it and on my hair&lt;br /&gt;Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Will be repurchasing this again</li>
    <li> Heaven in a bottle.  You smell like the tropic when you use this as body wash.</li>
    <li> Smells so good, lasts on skin for hours, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness. ❤️❤️❤️</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me for my sun tan skin...lots of sun from hiking, walks &amp; softball games.  It is great as an everyday all over body lotion.  Smells great and is good food sensitive skin.  Great for dry ends on your hair too.</li>
    <li> smells good if you like coconut oil and want something with a fragrance this is perfect for you.</li>
    <li> Not wild about it. It smells like it has turpentine in it.</li>
    <li> This oil has a wonderful, sweet scent.  I use in on my skin and in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered two of these so far.</li>
    <li> I have searched high and low for my super sensitive skin years and started by trying the coconut oil I cook with haha, loved it and now buy this. My skin is glowing and dries fast. No more itchy legs!! Buy it. Smells amazing too.</li>
    <li> Love love love this oil..I received it just as described if not better because mine did not have the problem of being in s solid form, the package was brand new and the flower was at the bottom..I used it in the shower that night and felt like I was in a tropical island and so smooth with a pleasant smell that was detected all night long. I will order again when it runs out.</li>
    <li> I use Monoi Tiare Tahiti Coconut Vanilla Oil daily on my hair and my body and it mositurizes so well!..Not only does it not leave a heavy greasy feeling but it makes my hair so much softer and easier to manage!...I&#x27;ll apply this oil after I get out of the shower and it locks in the moisture and my skin feels soft and supple all day long!..What I also love about Monoi Tahiiti Coconut Vanilla Oil is the irresitable smell of vanilla last until I wash my hair again the next day!...I love smelling sweet all day!:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a couple of quick fun facts about Vanilla:&lt;br /&gt;Vanilla is an appetitie suppresant and it also can help repell mosquitoes b/c they can&#x27;t stand the smell of vanilla!</li>
    <li> I bought the vanilla scented one and it is quite strong...it smells kind of like vanilla cotton candy. It is so strong that I find it best to cut it with some unscented coconut oil...which as an added bonus makes it last much longer. In my climate this oil is a solid at room temperature. I would have given them that last star if it had been in a wide short jar instead. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a liquid in Tahiti but not in Seattle. Fortunately, running the bottle under some warm water releases enough oil to do the job. I like to use is to sooth my legs after shaving or waxing them. All in all, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good buy and a nice treat for my skin.</li>
    <li> Smells great and keeps my skin looking wonderful. I get compliments on how I smell all the time when wearing this!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this and the feel seems thicker than regular coconut oil. I only have to use a quarter sized amount for my body. It spreads nicely and the smell is not overwhelming. Love it.</li>
    <li> This smells absolutely yummy!!  Better than I had hoped. YAY!</li>
    <li> Smells awesome! Just had a baby &amp; was looking for something quick to put on in the shower instead of lotion after the shower. Smells so amazing, tropical smell with a nice amount of vanilla so you don&#x27;t smell too overpowering. Leaves my skin nice &amp; soft. Wish it came in a much much bigger bottle, I may even water it down a bit in a spray bottle. I really love the smell.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite go to for my curly hair. I love the smell, and get compliments every single time I wear it. Wonderful on my skin too!</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my best friend for her birthday.  She absolutely loves it!  She has already purchased more because she went through it so quickly, said she wished they sold this product in a larger size.</li>
    <li> What a great product - this one smells heavenly and feels even better on the skin, which stays hydrated all day.  Nice benefit for northern climates in winter - feel like you&#x27;re in the tropics.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and I really like how smooth my skin feels. When its cool or cold it will solidify. But that doesn&#x27;t bother me one but because that means it&#x27;s natural/real coconut oil. If it didn&#x27;t solidify, I wouldn&#x27;t want it on my skin because my question would be &amp;#34;what the heck is this?&amp;#34; If you turn it upside down, put it next to the tub or sink, carefully let some of the oil descend it will be just fine.  For me it was either the big bottle of chemicals or a little patience for the real stuff. Sorry for the long winded comment. In short, I&#x27;m going to purchase 3 more :).</li>
    <li> This oil was recommended to me by someone as a product she uses to help moisturize her nails. I use it at night as a hand moisturizing treatment.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my feet as well, works nicely to help moisturize my summer dry feet. I haven&#x27;t actually used it as a tanning oil yet.  Has a great fragrance. Item arrived on time and was well packaged.</li>
    <li> Smelled great but I didn&#x27;t see any difference than using lotion. I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> My friend received monoi oil on a cruise line &amp; we&#x27;ve been using it on our feet to keep them smooth in the summer. But when I looked up the price, it was $60+. So I searched around &amp; found this comprable oil. I received it quickly, dispite not being amazon prime eligible, so I was happy about that. 4 oz. may not seem like a lot, but you literally only need less than a dime size drop of this to do an entire foot! It smells amazing!!! It is an oil, but within 10 minutes, it was absorbed and my feet are not particularly dry. It smells wonderful and feels super nice. I decided to spread some onto my legs and it provides a nice sheen. I do not think this would make a good massage oil though, due to how quickly it is absorbed into the skin. Try it. I would be surprised if you do not love it!</li>
    <li> The vanilla scented oil is amazing and not overpowering. There isn&#x27;t really anything to control the flow of the oil from the bottle, though. It comes out very fast even when you&#x27;re trying to pour slowly - and that&#x27;s kind of annoying. I wish there was something over the mouth of the bottle that controlled the flow of oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise this is fantastic and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy or sticky. The smell is delicious. I also put a little in my hair, but again it&#x27;s very hard to pour out just a few drops.</li>
    <li> This product worked perfectly for my purpose. Packaging was excellent and shipped in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel soft. First purchased in French Polynesia and instead of flying there again, was thrilled to see it online. Lovely smell.</li>
    <li> i use it for my dry skin, my hair, smells wonderful....i almost use up mine, will buy another one.</li>
    <li> Smells great, bottle is pretty, but difficult to get oil out of the bottle without warming it under water. I think the product inside is a good oil, but would be better if in different container.</li>
    <li> The scent is fabulous! It&#x27;s a smallish bottle (too much to travel with, unfortunately). I&#x27;ve read other reviews, and I can see how some would have trouble when the oil is warm, it comes out too quickly. Well I got mine in the winter, so I&#x27;ve been forced to dig my finger into the little opening to scrape some out!&lt;br /&gt;So the bottle design needs some work, but the product is wonderful!</li>
    <li> smells great! you have to soak in it a sink full of warm water in the winter, but if you are in a warm climate.. theres no need!</li>
    <li> Great skin product and conditioner. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin silky soft</li>
    <li> Smells amazing great product works great</li>
    <li> Used to make brown sugar body scrub and it works beautifully on dry skin especially when combined with other body oils.</li>
    <li> And, it was worth the try.  Smells so good.  Coconut oil is awesome for the skin.  My daughter, the esthetician, recommended this.</li>
    <li> Excellent product; fair price; very very good shipping; would buy again</li>
    <li> First got this product in Hawaii and I have always loved it.</li>
    <li> I will purchase more of this! It has the most delicious scent and makes my skin feel so soft. Please note that it is a solid in the bottle which has gentle heating instructions. It is worth the extra step to feel the wonderful oil and smell the vanilla!</li>
    <li> Not sure if my oil was old or not, but it didn&#x27;t look good when I received it.  It was in solid form and looked old.  Threw it out!</li>
    <li> I love the scent and what it does for my skin and hair. My hair feel softer and no flyaway.  A must try and a small amount goes a long way for the hair. You may have to experience to get the right amount for you hair length.</li>
    <li> If u like Pacifica island vanilla or any of the demeter cake scents u will adore this scent.  if u know the old l&#x27;occitane vanilla or any of the other vanilla I mentioned u will not be disappointed. This is a sweet vanilla lovers dream!</li>
    <li> Received product quickly. Love the smell and feel of it.</li>
    <li> Love this product on my skin.  Absorbs well into my skin, no greasy and has a nice hint of Vanilla which is light.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re very happy to receive the product and the packaging was good. It took a bit longer to arrive than we expected but it was still well within the suggested timeframe.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I am addicted to the vanilla coconut smell. It is light, refreshing, and almost airy. The oil is hydrating but be warned, the bottle is small.</li>
    <li> Smells great, but the smell doesn&#x27;t last long. It makes me look a little greasy for a while, but my skin absorbs it and it&#x27;s fine after a little while. I&#x27;d buy this again. Also, I think there should be a lid with a pump.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, LOVE this oil!  Use on body after shower.  Smells amazing!  Really really nice.  I want to try the other scents but each time I reorder I keep going back to this one because it is so nice!  I only wish it was sold in a larger bottle-I can go through this size bottle in a couple of weeks.  I&#x27;ve never had any issues with shipping, never had any spillage-which I have endured with similar products previously so this has been a welcome change!  Will most def repurchase-over and over.  Can&#x27;t recommend enough!</li>
    <li> I wish this came in a bigger bottle, it is a delicious fragrance and makes my skin look and feel gorgeous.</li>
    <li> It smells so good and makes my skin feel wonderful. Great product. Did I mention how good it smells ummm?!</li>
    <li> This oil smells sooo... good. It&#x27;s the scent that pauses a passerby to find out what that wonderful aroma is. As said in other reviews it absorbs nicely with no oily residue, just leaves you soft. And there is a vanilla bean in the bottle, caught me by surprise nice touch though. Great find, great treat.</li>
    <li> Have been ordering this oil or others by the same company for years. Wonderful ... just wonderful.</li>
    <li> Mixed with grape seed it did not go sold I love it.</li>
    <li> I remember this product being on the market for quite some time now as a kid a remember the divine smell of it when my step sister used it.&lt;br /&gt;For the past 2 years ive been ordering it from time to time but recently very often.&lt;br /&gt;I love coconut oil and the health benefits of it is amazing! Whether for your skin or hair this product is ideal!&lt;br /&gt;What tops it all is the super nutty smell of it! Usually pure coconut oil doesn&#x27;t have a smell, but the the hint of Vanilla and tiaré flower in it makes it heavenly!&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t make my skin too oily! It gaves it a natural glow! I live in the Sunshine state of Florida and i don&#x27;t have to worry about about my skin being too greasy. I add a drop of it in my daily moisturizer. I also use it after i shampoo and dry my dreadlocks and it moisturizes my locks nicely.&lt;br /&gt;The reason i give it 4 stars is because the bottle opening is very poor quality it pour out too much of oil all at once and if ur not careful it spills all over the place! I usually keep the bottle in my bag and because of that i put it into a plastic zip lock bag for protection and i dont know how, it still runs out and the bottle is closed! It&#x27;s a greasy mess! The first set of bottles came with a plastic safety top on the inside but my last order came with none! The company really needs to consider a more secure bottle top for it! Apart from that i trully recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I loveee this stuff lol i get compliments all the time about how yummy i smell. It is a true vanilla smell not a sugar cookie smell. I wish is came in a larger container.because i need more lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m typically somewhat irritated with coconut oil as a moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t rub in easily and it feels heavy. But this melts immediately when you start rubbing it in and it seems to absorb considerably better than straight up coconut oil from a jar.&lt;br /&gt;And this stuff smells good enough to eat. It has a rich vanilla smell with a hint of real gardenias (and this is the only product with any sort of flower smell that I can stand to wear--because it doesn&#x27;t smell perfume-y or fake). And the smell lasts much longer than any other conventional lotion I use. I&#x27;ve had people get comically excited over what lotion I&#x27;m wearing. The stuff smells that delightful.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this!!!! Incredible! It works really nicely on my hair as well as my skin.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd bottle. I put this on all over my body after a shower or bath and feel so luxurious. The smell is super yummy! It&#x27;s very tropical coconut/vanilla. Mostly smells like vanilla. Last summer after sunning, I couldn&#x27;t live without this oil. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Overall I like this product- I&#x27;ve used it as both a body oil and in my hair. Smell is strong out of the bottle, but it dulls quickly to a nice sweet vanilla scent. Leaves my skin soothed and hair soft. It does however harden which I find annoying- it will &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; quickly if you take it in the shower with you or run it in hot water in the sink, but I don&#x27;t always remember to do that, or sometimes I&#x27;d like to use it quickly as not part of a shower routine. Like it otherwise.</li>
    <li> Smells really good! VERY sugary. It actually reminds me of a more natural version of the sugar perfume. Kind of like cotton candy. My bottle has not lasted very long, so I think I will start mixing this with a base oil to tone down the sugar and make it last longer. I like it!</li>
    <li> I use this as a pre-poo conditioner.  Like the strength coconut oil gives my hair.  The fragrance is not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Everything went well.I love it. I just wish it was in a big bottle. I will be ordering again.it cost a lot for a little container. But I love the smell.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like having to haet the bottle to get out the oil.  The product is itself if nice.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff, I wish it came in a larger bottle! It smells and works great, and the best part is that its natural.</li>
    <li> You only need a teaspoon size for  your damp hair after a shower. When I use it for my nephews curly ethnicity hair I use a little more</li>
    <li> The Tahiti Coconut Oil smells fabulous!</li>
    <li> smells delish!! helps my hair and skin to be more soft!! BUY IT!!!!</li>
    <li> People that don&#x27;t know that natural coconut oil solidifies in cooler temperatures are probably the only reason this product does not have a perfect 5 star rating. The vanilla bean in the bottle is a great touch to this product. The natural smell of vanilla isn&#x27;t overpowering, which is a welcomed touch to the overall versatility of coconut oil. All that is missing is a better top to pour smaller amounts from the bottle.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fiancée, so this review is mainly HER perspective :) (I&#x27;m not using it, but really like it). A little goes a long way. Nice, but was expecting it to be sweeter and more \\&quot;coconutty\\&quot;, but I suppose that is due to the Tahitian flowers. Lovely product overall! Miss the pretty lady on the label, but that logo is on other products. Great sensual beauty line :)</li>
    <li> Product is great... The scent is light vanilla and it  moisturizes so well! It&#x27;s also perfect for soothing a sunburn. I gave it 4 stars because the bottles leaked a little during shipping.</li>
    <li> This is great!!!! It is organic and has the vanilla bark in it very pleased with it. I use it to create my hair oils</li>
    <li> I recently heard about this product on who, what, wear. I think it will be an upcoming trend and see why. It is coconut oil which i use in cooking and have put on my hair before. it is an oil and mine wasnt separated, as some people complained of. the smell is not that fakey vanilla smell so many lotions smell of. It is definitely more creamy. You can actualy see a flower in it! So far i am loving it and the only reason i gave it 4 stars is that there is nothing to stop the oil from pouring out, so you have to be really careful.</li>
    <li> Love it and fast shipping, thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this oil!  It works great on its own as a moisturizer or hair treatment, but I also use it to scent homemade beauty products.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get oil in the mail, I got a lotion and people say it smells really good while mine is unscented or at least it appears to be.</li>
    <li> I returned the first one and gave it a bad review but the second one was perfect !  I just got a bad bottle.  I use it while I am in the shower.  Scent lasts for 12 hours.  Lovely scent !</li>
    <li> I love this oil , smell awesome great product !</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have very long hair that&#x27;s also very dry and this moisturizes it very well. Although it&#x27;s solid below 68 degrees F, I have no problems warming it up (by either putting the bottle in hot water, on the radiator or in the microwave for a few seconds) to turn it liquid again for use.</li>
    <li> The picture is not how it appears, its milky that will melt away into oil.  Smells great and very concentrate.  Small bottle, good for traveling.</li>
    <li> This smell is amazing! A lovely tahitian, vanilla, coconut smell. I use it on my hair whenever it feels dry and it makes my hair look revived and fresh. I normally have very dry hair.</li>
    <li> The one and only complaint is it does NOT specifically state if it is food safe.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item twice- It smells delicious when you put it on and makes your skin luxuriously soft. It does not keep the smell, however.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this! Smells so good and my skin loves it.  I wish it came in a bigger bottle.  I use it so often, I already need to re-purchase so my skin stays happy!</li>
    <li> I had actual flower and stem in my bottle. Smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I could hardy smell vanilla here, even when I stuck my nose in the bottle. It feels nice, but based on other reviews, I envisioned smell-induced flashbacks to tropical vacations and that yummy wonderfulness of the tropics. This is oil you can put on your body that has a very faint smell of vanilla. I would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Love it, the smell is wonderful. I make a scrub with coarse sugar and use half of this and half regular coconut oil, smells fabulous!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite body oil, along with their regular one. Each bottle of oil has a flower in them and they smell absolutely wonderful! They leave your skin feeling wonderful and the smell stays with you all day. I have used these oils for several years now and highly recommend them, as well as Monoi Tiare Tahiti&#x27;s other products.</li>
    <li> I wanted to get a coconut oil because I had heard that it helped clear up a skin condition that I have and yet I didn&#x27;t want to smell like suntan lotion or fast food. When I saw this oil with a vanilla fragrance I jumped at the chance to try it. Let me say I am not disappointed! The vanilla fragrance is strong at first but within moments mellows to a faint sweet marshmallow and then disappears. The oil is not greasy and my skin seems to drink it up, and my skin condition has started clearing up as well! I use it on my children when they get out of the bath instead of lotion and they love it. I also put some in my hair for a couple hours before shampooing and when I got out I didn&#x27;t need my regular leave in conditioner, so I think I&#x27;ll try it once a week to maintain my hair texture. This oil is great and because a little goes a long way the 4oz.bottle is lasting longer than I thought it would. I shopped around for Monoi oil and this is the best product &amp; price, some products aren&#x27;t 100% coconut oil and sell for far more so I&#x27;ll be getting more of this when it finally runs out.</li>
    <li> This stuff has your skin so soft and moist and it does not have a greassy feel to it but you sure can feel the softness and moisture</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It&#x27;s basically just coconut oil with a bit of vitamin e oil, vanilla fragrance and a tiare flower in the bottom. The smell is AMAZING. It smells like baked goods, and lingers for around 12 hours (not strong or overpowering even on initial application, just yummy). It is very moisturizing, can seem greasy if you overapply, and sinks in quickly. I prefer it to &#x27;regular&#x27; extra virgin coconut oil because it seems to go on smoother for some reason. The packaging is meh - when you first get it, it has this inner lid thing that has to be removed- it&#x27;s hard to remove/not get stuck inside the bottle. It has a screw top lid and I really wish it had a flip top lid instead. I&#x27;ve almost tipped and spilled the whole thing mid application many times so packaging leaves something to be desired. But the product inside is amazing. A bit spendy compared to &#x27;regular&#x27; coconut oil, but worth it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Leaves my skin so soft, and smells amazing!!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful! It easily liquifies if you run it under warm water for about 10 seconds.</li>
    <li> could not get most of product out of container</li>
    <li> My # 1 coconut oil now! ! Love the smell.</li>
    <li> I love this monoi oil it smells very good and the scent lasts a long time! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> great product exactly as ordered thank you</li>
    <li> On the prowl for a scent similar to nars monoi body oil and I had high hopes for this and.....no.........Not close. This scent was very faint and had a weird after smell. Like it smelt like one way when i first put it on then it smelt crazy after a couple minuted. Idk maybe I got a bad batch. I won&#x27;t be re purchasing. And I had high hopes for this one</li>
    <li> Got some of this while in Tahiti and it is so pleasant smelling and nice.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. Your skin will feel like silk once you use it. It does not take much product for the great effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LW. Kansas City, MO</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself! This smells so good. It makes your hair really soft and it makes u smell so heavenly. Can&#x27;t wait to purchase my next one</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Moistuizes and smells heavenly!  Will keep purchasing!  The only thing is, if it is cold, it will solidify and is hard to get out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for the first time and am in love!  This is the most amazing smelling stuff ever.  I put a little on wrists and behind my ears, under my hair, in my hair, everywhere!  It solidifies but can be easily warmed into a liquid.  My skin feels great and smells great.  It is a marshmellow mixed with vanilla and heaven type scent which fades quickly but your skin has a mellow sweet smell.  I get tons of compliments of people wondering what perfume I have on.  I&#x27;ve never used oils before and it&#x27;s great.  Definitely worth every penny I paid.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and I DO LIKE it. It is great for the skin, feet, hands, etc... but not really worth the price.  It is only coconut oil and different essential oils.  I can make this at home for less and in so many other scents. If you can&#x27;t get it out the bottle.  Put is in hot water and it will soften. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> smells wonderful with real natural vanilla bean sticks for scent! Once it soaks in it leaves you feeling soft.  My only fear is that because it is oil it will assist me in burning if I  go out afterwards in the hot sun.  So I&#x27;ve only ever applied it if I&#x27;m not going out.</li>
    <li> I LOVE it, only complaint is I&#x27;d buy a bigger bottle!  Its delicious, never over-powering.</li>
    <li> Received item as promised and as described.  It&#x27;s wonderful!  Thank youW</li>
    <li> expectations were met! service excellent</li>
    <li> smells delicious, definitely the real deal!</li>
    <li> Bought this because of a friend&#x27;s suggestion.  It has a nice light smell that reminds me of sugar cookies.  My skin absorbs it fast and the oil leaves me soft.  I am excited about trying other scents!</li>
    <li> Smells great. I use it for my hair and skin. Wish it was in a bigger bottle. It turns into a solid pretty quickly but whenver I plan I on using it, I run it under hot water for 30-45 seconds.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I had heard so much about it. I originally bought it to use for my hair, but I&#x27;ve since started using it on my skin. It&#x27;s wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I use it when I get out of the shower mostly, but sometimes I use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s helped keep my hair smooth, shiny, and hydrated. I only apply it from the mid-length of my hair down to the ends and my hair never gets oily. I have fine, easily breaking hair and this has helped diminish the amount of split and broken ends that I have.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels plump, soft and moisturized which has been amazing because I tend to have pretty dry skin.  It&#x27;s also helped prolong the length of my tan. It doesn&#x27;t feel very oily the skin at all. It really seems to absorb well.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is amazing.  The vanilla doesn&#x27;t smell cheap or too sweet. It&#x27;s a very nice, subtle scent.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint, as is most people&#x27;s, is that I wish they sold it in a larger bottle. I think I&#x27;ll blow through this bottle quick.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love with this coconut oil and once I&#x27;m finished with this bottle, I&#x27;ll be repurchasing a new one. Maybe two.</li>
    <li> Great product and great transaction. Very moisturizing all over the body and I really love the scent. Lasts forever. I would purchase again.</li>
