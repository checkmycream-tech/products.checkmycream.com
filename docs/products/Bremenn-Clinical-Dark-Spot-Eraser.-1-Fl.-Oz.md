    <li> I Love this product  it removed my  sun spot and more.. Bremenn clinical dark spot eraser was recommended to me by a friend, she said it removed her molasses spots. I usually use the Alpha Hydrox brand which it removed all my acne dark scars but did not remove the other unwanted spots.  I bought Bremenn clinical dark spot eraser and after a week of use I saw results. Sun spot over my top lip were completely gone, and a few freckles on my cheek are lighter in color.</li>
    <li> Does not work well. After one month of daily use, sometimes 2XD, just a slight lighten. Not enough for the expense or time spent.</li>
    <li> I have used  one tube and it worked removing a dark spot I had. Going to use this tube to do the same with oher spots.&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I have used it previously, &amp; it actually does diminish the dark spots significantly.  Will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> After 2 months of daily use, there is no noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve veen using these Bremenn eraser for a couple weeks now, morning and night, and I haven&#x27;t seen that much difference.</li>
    <li> I bought this product strictly for my arms.  Most older women&#x27;s forearms look very discolored.  I&#x27;ve tried product after product.  Some less expensive, some more.  Though the brown spots haven&#x27;t completely disappeared, they are noticeably lighter.  I&#x27;m not giving up, but so far this is the best I&#x27;ve used, and I will continue to use it unless I discover something better.</li>
    <li> It turned out I had an allergic reaction to it. Iwas unable to use it at all. I hope it works better for everyone else</li>
    <li> I wok as rural carrier at the postal service and I received sun every day and I think my skin still the same with flakes</li>
    <li> I have not found any difference in my skin condition so far after using it twice a day for almost a month.</li>
    <li> On my second bottle. Got it at Costco on sale. Almost finished with the second bottle and didn&#x27;t even lighten my brown spots a bit. Very disappointed. Hoped that it would work. Would never use this produt again</li>
    <li> The product definitely lightened my dark spots on my hands, but it also was very harsh and after ten third use left very red burn spots that lasted for days.</li>
    <li> The dark spots on my face seem to be lighter. It will take time, I&#x27;m sure, to fade them and I don&#x27;t expect to ever get rid of them, but at least they are lighter.</li>
    <li> Look like it is working now.&lt;br /&gt;I like to use twice per day!&lt;br /&gt;Some dark spots of mine have been faded.</li>
    <li> I choose this product for hope in finding a product that actually would work on my brown sots, yeah right. The place I ordered the product from was dependable and perfect service!. I do not get why, no matter what you pay, no one can help you with dark spots on your face, just add more  cover-up on your face! Stop the Madness! Stop the madness. Why can&#x27;t anyone do what they say they are going to do?</li>
    <li> Saw no lightening at all.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.  Could the fact I&#x27;m 84 years old affect it&#x27;s performance?</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;ve used this product long enough to really rate it. So far, I&#x27;ve not noticed much change in the color of the areas to which I applied it.</li>
    <li> I have a dark spot on my cheek and used this product as recommended, twice a day, for about 2 month now. No change at all, VERY DISAPPOINTED – save your money and try something else.</li>
    <li> Finally a dark spot remover that works!</li>
    <li> found this at a big box store and it really helped spots lighten or go away&lt;br /&gt;When it was not at store I thought of Amazon and there it was and cheaper&lt;br /&gt;being Prime membership no shipping cost and did not have to waste gas to get it&lt;br /&gt;I continue to use it and my hairdresser now likes it&lt;br /&gt;In Texas it is sunny most of year and is great to put on hands on the wheel that&lt;br /&gt;get a lot of sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;I do always use a 45 sun screen too</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a few weeks. My spots may have faded some; it&#x27;s honestly hard to say if they have or it&#x27;s wishful thinking. I think they have faded a little bit.</li>
    <li> THE TUBE IS VERY LIMITED IN ITS CONTENT.  I AM STILL IN THE PROCESS OF USING AND WILL BE ABLE TO EVALUATE ITS EFFECTIVENESS IN ABOUT MONTH.&lt;br /&gt;EASTER PITTMAN</li>
    <li> No noticeable fading of dark spots</li>
    <li> I have being using this product for about 3 weeks only once a day (label recommends twice a day) and I am seeing results that I have not seen with other dark spot removers.  I will continue the use of this product and if the results continue, I will reorder this product.....also I have sun damaged spots on my face that this product is fading.  If this product continues to produce the results that I am currently experiencing, I will reorder this product.  Age 64.</li>
    <li> this product works very good on me. However , the price is little bit high compare with others. I still recommend it for my friends.</li>
    <li> Have used it for 3 weeks twice a day as directed with very little results.  I am quite disappointed at the results, expected much better results as advertised. .</li>
    <li> It works better than other products that I have tried.</li>
    <li> Absolutely works 100%.</li>
    <li> I am still using this and one spot I have been concentrating on may b slightly less dark.  I will continue using this product.&lt;br /&gt;until it is empty or I can tell there is no improvement</li>
    <li> It took a very long time using this daily for me to see my dark spots looking lighter.  I will continue to use and finish the product and review again after that.</li>
    <li> My face has cleared up with this dynamic Dark spot Eraser. I am so sorry I waited so long to buy it. So I am going to continue using it. Thank you so much,</li>
    <li> So far I have been using this product twice a day for 1 full month and it has done absolutely nothing.</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t work on me the spots don&#x27;t go away</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much difference.</li>
    <li> Been using for a year. Very slow to lighten.</li>
    <li> This does seem to lighten the spots. They don&#x27;t completely go away so far but I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> It is starting to fade my dark spots. I will have to use it longer before I do get final results.</li>
    <li> It has done absolutely nothing to the dark pigment on my skin.  Just another product and I have even spoken to my Dermatologist who&#x27;s given me an old home remedy and so far so good and so much less expensive!  IT&#x27;S Castor Oil mixed with a few other ingredients.</li>
    <li> does not work...Don&#x27;t waist your money.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Costco on a whim as my general assumption is that none of these creams work. I was wrong! The dark spot about 1/4 inch above my lip (which I&#x27;ve been covering with liquid cover for more than a year) is pretty much gone. It seems that the general darkening immediately above my top lip is also lightening. I remain surprised that something actually worked!</li>
    <li> I have noticed liver/sun spots have become lighter.  The only problem is that it is such a small tube and runs out fast because I use it on my arms and face.</li>
    <li> My mother gave the dark spot eraser that she bought at Costco. I have benn applying for 5 weeks  a dark spot i have on my right cheeck,. It really has gotten ligther.  I am vety happy with the product!,, Try it it may not work on all spots but it might be that it works on you spot!!</li>
    <li> Hassn&#x27;t lightene the dark spots on my face as much as I expected or hoped yet.  Hardly can tell any diference yet.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 8 weeks and have not noticed any difference in the dark spots on my face.</li>
    <li> I used this product faithfully and according to directions and didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all.  What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on a sunspot for more than a month now and it hasn&#x27;t even disapeared a little!</li>
    <li> Okay, this is only a week old trial, but based on that I&#x27;m impressed!  I bought mine also at costco ($39).  I have used it on my hands 2x a day, very lightly as directed (at this rate, it&#x27;s going to last me a long time.)  I am a runner, and I neglected my hands with the sunscreen, so they are covered in patchy red/tan spots.  My hand look old!  I started on Monday evening and this is friday.  There is a very noticeable difference.  The light tan spots are almost gone, and the blotchy red ones are WAY less noticeable.  Now, I haven&#x27;t gone out in the sun since its winter and I wear gloves.  The test will be on vacation, but I&#x27;m hopeful  I have 2 spots on my nose and one on my cheek that I just started using.  It remains to be seen if it will work.</li>
    <li> So far better than any I have tried.  Progress is slow, but a change seems to be happening.  Will be patient and stick with it to see the outcome.</li>
    <li> My mother bought me this product as a gift. I am a mixed, white/black woman having serious problems with pigmentation on my cheeks, forehead, and lips.  After using this product for 3 weeks I noticed significant lightening of the darkened areas.  After approximately 4 weeks, my skin tone was even and the pigmentation had diminished.  I would recommend this product to women with my type of complexion. I am very, very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> I think it works rather well but you don&#x27;t get much and it&#x27;s very expensive. There are other products out there that do the same thing and costs a lot less.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find it at Amazon.  For me it is one of the best dark spot erasers I&#x27;ve tried.  I have tried quite a few.</li>
    <li> The problem with dark spots is that with a topical cream like Bremenn is that the improvement is so gradual that you may not notice any change for months.  Usually takes a few tubes to start noticing some improvement.  Since the dark spots are also underneath the top layers of skin, they take time to move up to the top.  I find getting rid of dark spots is a never ending project and requires an assault from many different treatments...continuously.</li>
    <li> Sorry, but it didn&#x27;t work for me. I used it twice a day and everything was the same.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the last 30 days and am seeing a faint reduction of my dark spot on my face. I will continue to use the product until the tube is empty and hopefully by that time the spot will be completely gone.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about 3 weeks and,I have not seen any difference yet.</li>
    <li> After three weeks there was no noticeable lightening of the area. I didn&#x27;t expect that the darkness would disappear but there was NO improvement.</li>
    <li> This product arrived fast but I have dark spots from pregnacy unfortunately I saw no difference</li>
    <li> this cream gave me a bad reaction, redness and itching and now this spot is inflamed and very noticeable.</li>
    <li> I had a very bad acne break out , and it left dark spots. So in hopes of getting my face clear again. I bought this product . First off. When you apply it and rub it in, it doesn&#x27;t dry or mix or whatever , it just stays on the skin , and is very greasy. Second off it made my break out very badly. So I&#x27;m very disappointed .</li>
