      <li>Works great on my very long hair.</li>
      <li>$50 for a salon result full size ionic dryer.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it my hair was much softer and more manageable.  </li>
      <li>, that is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>The nozzle is perfect - rotates, doesn&#x27;t fall off, thin opening for directing the air.  </li>
      <li>It gets HOT if desired (can set to cool, warm or hot; high, medium or low) for styling/straightening, and has a cool shot.  </li>
      <li>Hair dries fast and left my fine hair very full and volumnized without any hair product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy which is good too.</li>
      <li>I actually received a compliment that my hair was very shiny and healthy</li>
      <li>Drys my hair super quick and is pretty quiet!!</li>
      <li>so I needed to replace it, and with the price on this 1900 watt positively ionic dryer, I had to give it a try.  </li>
      <li>I pretty much keep it on hot high.  </li>
      <li>While this bling is cute, and probably sells dryers as an impulse buy, but I&#x27;m more practical and would rather have saved the extra money that was put into these little blings, but that&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
      <li>There is a HUGE difference in the shininess and silkiness of my hair after using it compared to a standard drug store dryer.</li>
      <li>so i could really see how it worked.</li>
      <li>This is a decent hair dryer for the price.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just this particular hair dryer or all of them, but the \\&quot;high\\</li>
      <li>So worth the current price of $59.95.  </li>
      <li>They did tell me that I could send it back to the manufacturer to have it replaced by them, and when I said that it wouldn&#x27;t be worth me shipping it to the UK to Babyliss, they said \\&quot;oh</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d had some other Babyliss dryers in the past that didn&#x27;t seem to make more than a year, but this baby is still going strong.  </li>
      <li>It dried my fine highlighted hair, which I have alot of, fast.</li>
      <li>dries my hair quickly (and that&#x27;s something to say, as my hair takes \\&quot;forever\\&quot; to dry) and the \\&quot;hot\\</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this blow dryer if your interested.</li>
      <li>It is really easy to accidentally change settings or turn it off mid blow dry.</li>
      <li>Dries it in a reasonable time \\&quot; 15 minutes\\&quot;and if I dry with my paddle hair brush it also make it straight as a board.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as heavy duty as my Chi was, but this is a fine dryer for the price.  </li>
      <li>It is very lightweight and not too loud but definitely a powerful little machine.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
      <li>I have long, semi-thick, very frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>At least when it breaks, you can easily return it.  </li>
      <li>The high was way to powerful for use with a round brush and the low took forever!</li>
      <li>I was very surprised to get a flat iron with this hairdryer purchase.  </li>
      <li>a bad dryer--not a professional Chi, but still a nice dryer.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just this particular hair dryer or all of them, but the \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting feels like low or medium. There is very little power at all. After reading all of the reviews on this manufacturer, I thought I was getting a great deal for a quality product. Not my experience.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer about a month ago and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it!  The first time I used it my hair was much softer and more manageable.  I have naturally curly hair and that&#x27;s no simple accomplishment. The only thing I&#x27;d change is the location of the switches. Several times I&#x27;ve accidentally turned it off when drying my hair.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> This is a decent hair dryer for the price. It dried my fine highlighted hair, which I have alot of, fast. It just needs a medium speed for styling.  The high was way to powerful for use with a round brush and the low took forever! I gave it to my Mom who has short hair and she is fine with it. Maybe I am not a pro with a blow dryer but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is the best product I have encountered.  It&#x27;s an investment.  I love it.  I convinced my sister to get it, and now my mother will be getting it too.  Everyone who uses it falls in love with it.  I recommend it 100%.</li>
    <li> I bought one about 6 months ago. I love it! It takes only 3 - 4 minutes to dry my hair.  My hair is long, and I have a lot of hair. I used to use a Revlon. I had no idea that a hair dryer makes such a difference.  It makes my hair shinier, too. It is true that this one is a little heavier than regular dryers, but it&#x27;s not that heavy.  I hope it will last for a long time, but when it breaks, I will get another Babyliss.</li>
    <li> The dryer definitely delivers as promised. There is a HUGE difference in the shininess and silkiness of my hair after using it compared to a standard drug store dryer. In fact, it looks just like after a visit to the Salon. It&#x27;s not too heavy which is good too. The bling factor is just sort of silly to me and was not a factor in my purchase. The negative- the placement of the buttons was not great engineering. It is really easy to accidentally change settings or turn it off mid blow dry. Overall, a very good buy though. $50 for a salon result full size ionic dryer. Good deal!</li>
    <li> After owning another babyliss for 6 years I wanted to get another one! I chose this model because is lightweight and has 1900 watts!! Drys my hair super quick and is pretty quiet!!</li>
    <li> I ordered the hairdryer and flat iron combo pack and when the flat iron stopped working 6 weeks after I purchased it, I contacted the seller, who refused to replace it.  They did tell me that I could send it back to the manufacturer to have it replaced by them, and when I said that it wouldn&#x27;t be worth me shipping it to the UK to Babyliss, they said \\&quot;oh it&#x27;s actually a Conair product and you would send it to them in the US\\&quot;.  So, save yourself money and go to Target and purchase a Conair hair dryer.  At least when it breaks, you can easily return it.  As for how the dryer works, it&#x27;s okay, nothing great as I&#x27;m sure a true Babyliss would be.</li>
    <li> I just got my dryer today and used it immediately. It is very lightweight and not too loud but definitely a powerful little machine. My hair was frizz free and super shiny - so far I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. It can&#x27;t hurt that it&#x27;s also very pretty even if the bling is completely unnecessary. Happy nonetheless.</li>
    <li> I ordered this one based on reviews and the price which was really good and i don&#x27;t regret it. Besides is beautiful is very powerful and not heavy. My hair does&#x27;t look frizzy at all and i try it without any leave-in treatment so i could really see how it worked. i&#x27;ve never had a babyliss before but i think they got me know.</li>
    <li> My Chi finally blew up so I needed to replace it, and with the price on this 1900 watt positively ionic dryer, I had to give it a try.  It&#x27;s not as heavy duty as my Chi was, but this is a fine dryer for the price.  It is not as quiet, and the cord is not as tough, but the unit is lighter in weight and the cord is just as long.&lt;br /&gt;It dries my hair quickly (and that&#x27;s something to say, as my hair takes \\&quot;forever\\&quot; to dry) and the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; setting is truly HOT and is great for styling.  The edge of the filter has little rhinestones on it, and it comes with a small rhinestone coated keychain in the shape of a hair dryer.  While this bling is cute, and probably sells dryers as an impulse buy, but I&#x27;m more practical and would rather have saved the extra money that was put into these little blings, but that&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad dryer--not a professional Chi, but still a nice dryer.  Worth the 49 dollars for sure.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised to get a flat iron with this hairdryer purchase.  So worth the current price of $59.95.  I tried it - amazing!!  Hair dries fast and left my fine hair very full and volumnized without any hair product.  Buy this duo before it runs out.</li>
    <li> Instead of receiving the [[ASIN:B002CGSDEU BaByliss Pro BABDTW5586 Diamond Titanium 1900-Watt Ionic Hair Dryer, White]], as ordered, I received another with a flat iron. I have no use for the flat iron and am very disappointed. I&#x27;m in the process of emailing the company to identify options. I don&#x27;t know if that has happened to others, but I wanted to let you know it happened to me. Chris</li>
    <li> Can anyone tell me if these dryers have a diffuser and concentrator? I am trying to decide which one to purchase. The black one says that it includes one ( diffuser) but it is not shown. It does show that it includes a concentrator but it does not say that it is included.</li>
    <li> I love my blow-dryer. I ordered for my bday years ago and I am so attached to it. My hair just flows after using with no static and no frizz it is just wonderful.</li>
    <li> Simply amazing!!! It&#x27;s the best I ever tried. I am fully satisfied about this product and I strongly suggest it.</li>
    <li> This is the most I&#x27;ve ever paid for a hair dryer but worth every penny.  My hair is very thick and this dryer does the job in minutes.  It&#x27;s light and not too noisy.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for a couple of years, and it is still in perfect condition.  I&#x27;d had some other Babyliss dryers in the past that didn&#x27;t seem to make more than a year, but this baby is still going strong.  I liked it so much I got the black one for my daughters (theirs is also still going strong).  The dryer is somewhat heavy to hold (occassionally I have to briefly rest my arm) and not very quiet (although quieter than others I&#x27;ve owned), but it seriously dries and styles your hair in a quick amount of time.

The nozzle is perfect - rotates, doesn&#x27;t fall off, thin opening for directing the air.  There air intake is easy to clean for lint/hair.  The rocker switch placement on the handle is a little annoying (I occassionally turn it off by mistake) but livable.  The cord is thick and long.  Based on the superior performance for years, this gets two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> This is a perfect example of paying for what you get. I have long, semi-thick, very frizzy hair. For years I have spent money on blow dryers that always lacked in performance. Bought this dryer, and my bad hair days are no more. I actually received a compliment that my hair was very shiny and healthy, that is worth every penny. Only critique, I let someone borrow the dryer and they snapped off the back filter/vent. Dryer still works perfectly, I just have to be careful that I don&#x27;t let my hair get sucked into the vent.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer.  It has great temperature control.  Don&#x27;t even hesitate if you are wondering whether to buy it or not.  It is excellent.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim but I am glad I did. Works great on my very long hair. Dries it in a reasonable time \\&quot; 15 minutes\\&quot;and if I dry with my paddle hair brush it also make it straight as a board. ( awesome discovery) I would definitely recommend this blow dryer if your interested. I&#x27;m so happy I have mine.</li>
