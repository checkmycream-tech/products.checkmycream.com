      <li>What can you say about a cheap tie clasp that clasps your tie to your shirt?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll begin by saying for so long</li>
      <li>In light of this design issue, I don&#x27;t recommend this product, as it is far too fragile.</li>
      <li>Instead, I would opt for a product such as Bundle Monster&#x27;s product BMC 4PC Necktie Clips, which I have had much success with and have received compliments on.</li>
      <li>Just wow.</li>
      <li>This tie bar snapped in half on the first day as I was putting the tie bar on.</li>
      <li>3 of them broke within the first two uses, other two seem sturdy enough.</li>
      <li>Apparently, there is a very delicate sliver of metal that holds this whole thing together, and it doesn&#x27;t take much to break.</li>

<li> It was wider than I expected, but that&#x27; my fault for not checking measurements.</li>
<li> Thin metal piece that holds the part where you press down to open thw clip.</li>
<li> It just needed to work and the price could be &amp;#34;our little secret.&amp;#34;  </li>
<li> Pay a few bucks for something that will work</li>
<li> Finally I looked for the least expensive one.  </li>
<li> Very poor quality.  </li>

    <li> This tie clip broke just as I was about to use it for the first time. Just wow.</li>
    <li> Snapped in half the second time I used it. I guess that&#x27;s why it was $2.</li>
    <li> Equivalent to the 30 dollar clips at the stores</li>
    <li> What can you say about a cheap tie clasp that clasps your tie to your shirt?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll begin by saying for so long my tie has ended up in....soup, oatmeal, mashed potatoes, fajitas, spaghetti, mussels, flambeed shrimp.  Gosh I could go on all day.  One day I thought &amp;#34;Why not get a tie clasp and avoid all these problems?&amp;#34;  I searched tie clasps and discovered you can invest a bunch of money in them.  Did I want a solid gold one which reenacted the skull scene from Macbeth?  Perhaps.....the number of options and prices was dizzying.  Finally I looked for the least expensive one.  My theory was the JOB of holding my tie close to my shirt didn&#x27;t involve significant engineering.  It didn&#x27;t need to be a great piece of art.  It just needed to work and the price could be &amp;#34;our little secret.&amp;#34;  THAT is why I am giving this tie clasp very high marks and a great recommendation.</li>

    <li> The tie clip looks very nice but it broke the second time I used it, and when you would try clipping in the tie it felt like if it was going to rip the tie</li>
    <li> Dont purchase cause its cheap it snaps and breaks way too easily</li>

    <li> It broke after one use. I have to push the inside part in place carefully each time or it doesn&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
    <li> I have used this 4 times and it snapped apart ! I know it&#x27;s cheap, but after waiting almost 2 months for it to arrive it should have lasted more than 4 uses !!</li>
    <li> too long for my skinny ties</li>
    <li> Son loves it accents it civil air patrol uniform great</li>
    <li> Good price. The clip almost clips over the side. Not evenly lined up. Good for the price. Ships from China where they only make the highest quality stuff.</li>
    <li> Broke the first time my son tried to wear it.  Very poor quality.  We were able to return it and get our money back.</li>
    <li> Bought a batch of 5. 3 of them broke within the first two uses, other two seem sturdy enough. Not high quality, but not terrible for the price.</li>
