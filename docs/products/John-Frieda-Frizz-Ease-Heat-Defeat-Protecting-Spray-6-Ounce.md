      <li>I don&#x27;t have dry hair, but would like to keep it that way, and this has helped greatly!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used another product until someone recommended this to me and I instantly loved it! It is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy!</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair looking shiny and minimizes damage. Contrary to other reviews, you can use this with a hair straightener. That&#x27;s what I do and it works beautifully. And I LOVE the way it smells!</li>
    <li> It makes my hair feel kind of sticky. But it does look very healthy. Thanks for sending it so quickly.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this, works well with my hair. ugh don&#x27;t know why they require me to write a story when I just want to give 5 stars</li>
    <li> Decent product, great seller.</li>
    <li> My hair seems to be drier after using this.  I generally have smooth, shiny hair but not with this product.  My ends seem dry and brittle.</li>
    <li> Arrived sooner than promised and exactly as expected-thanks</li>
    <li> This is awesome makes my hair smell good and smooth and silky</li>
    <li> it was like adding hair spray to damp hair. it doesn&#x27;t help with tangles in long hair to comb out. don&#x27;t apply till you have comb out hair first.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t create a frizz free look for my hair.  In fact, I think it made it worse.  I&#x27;m not sure if its a good fit for people who dye their hair and have damage to the ends.</li>
    <li> Seems fine but definitely no radical and noticeable improvement.  I am sure it helps but it is hard to tell.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of this spray. I have used a heat protective spray before that worked great, however, this one turned my hair greasy.</li>
    <li> It works fine... Makes hair smooth &amp; shiny... Especially when used with and after the curling iron I have... Thank you</li>
    <li> I am not sure this stuff works, but it definitely smells really good. I have not noticed a difference in my hair after using the flat iron; with or without the product, it seems the same.</li>
    <li> The bottle arrived empty. I love the product, I have purchased in stores previously and I really like the brand. As for this purchase, having it arrive empty was a huge disappointment.</li>
    <li> I have not used to many other frizz ease hair products but it definitely protects your hair when using a flat iron or ceramic curling iron and certainly eliminates the freeze. Nice products, delivers it&#x27;s promise. I will purchase, again.</li>
    <li> I use this each time I wash my hair as it is fine hair and tends to frizz and tangle easily. This helps to keep my hair conditioned and has resulted in the ability to grow it out to shoulder length. As a result I need to use little, if any styling product.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite John Frieda products. It really works and doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or feel funny. It smells really good too.</li>
    <li> This works okay. Smells good and the spray is nice and even. I won&#x27;t be repurchasing though because it makes my hair a bit oily (even with light use). I prefer the tresemme</li>
    <li> love this item.  i am very fussy about my hair and this helps keep the flyaways away and i don&#x27;t feel that my hair is not as brittle after blow drying.</li>
    <li> This really works. I was skeptical at first, but it has made a big difference in my hair. No more frizz!</li>
    <li> Love it as a bi-racial female this product really has help my hair and I don&#x27;t wear my hair straight but when I do I put this in before I blow dry my hair to straightened it.</li>
    <li> Yes. I use and love it! XOXOXOXO</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do any wonders to my super frizzy hair... It&#x27;s like just any heat tamer spray.. Nothing special... I am not gonna order again...</li>
    <li> Really like this spray! The best part about it for me is the scent. . it is not overwhelming or perfumy but it is light and fresh. I have thick hair and it tames the frizz enough for my needs.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and have a hard time finding it.&lt;br /&gt;This way it arrives at my door and is exactly what I need.</li>
    <li> just another useless hair product</li>
    <li> This product was very helpful in my frizzy hair. I have thick long hair and it worked wonders before I flat ironed it! Smelled great and lasted all day!</li>
    <li> I use this when I dry and style my hair with the Frieda hot Air Brush, and it works very well and gives me a smooth finish, so it has been an excellent choice on my part and I will order it again.</li>
    <li> My favorite heat protector ever! Smells so good and does a great job at protecting my hair and making it shine. I use it with a flat iron and curling iron and it works just fine.</li>
    <li> Perfect addition to the set</li>
    <li> I used it with the hot air brush, it is really good, not so much hair damage after I used it.</li>
    <li> Leaves a starchy feeling. The spray protects well against the heat, but the starchy, dirty feeling it leaves is a drawback. One starts with clean, smooth, happy hair and ends with hair that feels like wool and also it feels like it will break if you run a  comb through it. I will use it since it cost money and I am not too rich to afford getting a newer one, but I really don&#x27;t like this spray.</li>
    <li> Great product will purchase again</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really see a difference?</li>
    <li> I was tired of paying 40 dollars for my hair straightening balm from my hair stylist so I decided to give this a try. I have wavy hair so not super curly and this product does the job! It keeps it straight for at least two days (I wash on the second) but overall, its worth the money. The only downside is that when I don&#x27;t use a volume booster, my hair is flat within two hours. Its a small sacrifice for a product that works very well at keeping your hair straight!</li>
    <li> I really like the way that the spray spreads out the liquid.  Much  easier to pump and disperses well, also protects against heat pretty well i think.</li>
    <li> great product. Works as described!</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing! After I shampoo and condition my  hair with argan oil infused products i spray this on my damp hair and utilize my blow dryer with a paddle brush. This will literally snap my flat iron time in half and also help to keep my hair straight at the roots considering my hair is natural curly and I have not had a perm in 2 years.</li>
    <li> Would not recommend it hardens my hairlike like a greasy pomade...yucks...i only used it twice then just throw it in the garbage.. I should have asked amazon for a refund.</li>
    <li> This product is working well for me because at times my hair will frizz up especially when it&#x27;s rainy and wet.  I like the product .</li>
    <li> Works wayyyyy better than I thought it would. Got it just because I got the John Frieda Hot Air Brush to go along with it, and I was out of heat protectant spray. But my goodness, I&#x27;ve tried many, many different heat protective sprays over the years, obviously, but this one does do a really good job at taming the frizz. Unlike some [most] of my other favorites which just do a really good job at protecting the hair from the heat! I am African American, so if that helps someone, then there ya go! Of course &amp;#34;Frizz&amp;#34; is like our middle name! ^_^ Hahaha... if it can tame the frizz-beast of the mane of an African American, then it definitely must be worth something! Of course I have other ways I tame my frizz also, and WANT the frizz at some other times. So it&#x27;s cool to have a good aiding agent to help even that much more along the way! And on a last note, this product grouped in with a couple more other items, came way, way, way earlier than expected! Not broken, punctured, opened, out of place or damaged. Which is all a plus in my book! Ok, Happy Shopping y&#x27;all, and remember to Always Keep It Classy! :)</li>
    <li> love the pump&lt;br /&gt;not sure how many chemicals it has&lt;br /&gt;I like to use naturally and ocassionally this one..&lt;br /&gt;it has spf too which i like most</li>
    <li> My hir was smoother with a lot less frizz. There was buildup on my hair. The spray is light and effective</li>
    <li> Living in Florida My Hair tends to get very frizzy especially during the summer.  I was rather pleased with how straight and frizz free my hair was after using this product.  I highly recommend giving this product a try.  I got many compliments.  I did my hair myself and was asked if I got it professionally done.</li>
    <li> I personally like it because it calms down the frizz while protecting my hair at the same time! I definitely recommend this product just as much as I recommend the rest the John Freida products.</li>
    <li> Very cost- affordable! Doesn&#x27;t work as well as other heat protectors though.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years now. I try to keep my hair healthy looking and know that using heat on it can damage it over time. I just use a few spritzes of this, along with my leave in conditioner and Shine, and it seems to do the job. I am in my early 60&#x27;s and my hair is still shiny and does not look frizzled or dry. So far so good.</li>
    <li> It probably protects the hair against the heat of the dryer well but my hair needs more body.  I went back to Tigi&#x27;s Catwalk Curls Rock Amplifier ( I have a perm).  It gives the hair a smooth feel and one can comb it well when it is wet after applying it.  It is too expensive in Amazon.com but I found it in in the grocery store at a more reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried to use something like this before I dry my hair and its awesome!</li>
    <li> Using the high temp irons, I&#x27;m really worried about hair damage and this keeps my hair protected and in good condition.  It sprays on easily and pleasant odor.  A little works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the John Frieda Frizz Eaze before and really like it! That&#x27;s why I ordered more when I also purchased a John Frieda Hot Air Styling Brush! I LOVE it! It works great and has cut the time to get my hair presentable in half! His products are great, as far as I can tell!</li>
    <li> I only need to put like 3 sprays of this in my hair in order to keep my hair from getting poofy and damaging my hair! ;)</li>
    <li> Protects my hair from split ends.  I love many of the Frizz East products.  Thanks John Frieda!</li>
    <li> Helps control the frizz and damage to my hair</li>
    <li> I love the frizz ease products so I was not surprised when I fell in love with this heat defense! It works great at adding shine while protecting your hair from the damage of styling.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this item and I have to say that it works really good for my hair. It takes the frizz right out of my hair when straightening, good product.</li>
    <li> This helps a little bit with the frizz when I blow dry my hair, but really not by much. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because the tiny amount that it helps really isn&#x27;t worth the price of the item. I&#x27;d rather try another product to see how it fares with my hair.</li>
    <li> Would buy again. I actually have very wavy hair and it really calmed the frizz down, and didn&#x27;t take away my wave.</li>
    <li> I read the instructions after to know how to use right. I used this twice before heating , and I think it doesn&#x60;t work.</li>
    <li> DOES NOTHING ANY OTHER BASIC PRODUCT WOULD DO....TRY ANY OF THEM AT CVS OR LESS MONEY...THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE EXCEPT THE PRICE...</li>
    <li> If you want to have a really FLAT, FLAT hair, this is a good product, but given the circumstances that I have a thin hair, this product  would be better if it gets you volume and at the same time stop the frizziness.</li>
    <li> Great heat protectant! Definitely keeps my ends from being fried and my stylist has noticed a change as well so I know the product works.</li>
    <li> The only product I&#x27;ve found that protects my hair from the heat of a hairdryer and straightener and also gives it a nice finished look.</li>
    <li> made my hair too dirty...</li>
    <li> Love this heat protectant. I wished it was available locally. But the price online isnt bad and it works amazingly with hair extensions</li>
    <li> Makes my medium size curls so smooth, love it!</li>
    <li> I have thinning naturally curly hair, with some hair extensions.  I don&#x27;t know exactly what this product is supposed to do, but it leaves my hair looking greasy and weighted down.  It is less frizzy, but at what cost? Maybe it just isn&#x27;t good for my hair type.</li>
    <li> Good product, unless you have wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;Quick shipping</li>
    <li> This styling spray reduces frizz and smells really good. I am not 100% sure about the heat protection, however my hair is very thin and I have yet to see damage after constantly ironing my hair (I apply the spray every time). I would buy it again just because of the frizz control and the amazingly clean scent.</li>
    <li> This works good for me, but my blow-dry doesn&#x27;t last very long b/c it gets oily faster.  This product does not work for my friend; her hair still gets extremely damaged!</li>
    <li> Seems to be working well, hair feels soft and easy to manage.</li>
    <li> Canlt live without it. User it after every shampoo. Keeps my hair smooth and frizz free.</li>
    <li> This is great heat protector and styling spray.  I have been using it for a number of years and have always been pleased.  It leaves a nice shine to my hair also.  I especially like it when I let my hair go to it&#x27;s natural curl... if I let it dry naturally or spay later and let it dry with the Frizz Ease on it, the curls become separated and highlighted... which I like.</li>
    <li> This product is very good at keeping the frizzies at bay during humid or rainy weather. It sells for a good price and protects hair from intense heat.</li>
    <li> I have searched for most of my life for that elusive product that will control my insane hair.  This works better than some by is not anything special.</li>
    <li> I got this because it was recommended by one of the women that was doing my hair. She told me to use before I blow dry or straighten my hair. That being said, I have used it (and other products) and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that great. I&#x27;ll stick with my SheaMoisture products or some other brands that I have tried as this wasn&#x27;t that great.</li>
    <li> I cannot get the full effect since the sprayer came apart.  I would have to use the product by putting the liquid in the palm of my hand and then on my head.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair sticky. I am asian and have thick black hair.</li>
    <li> It is okay as long as the humidity isn&#x27;t too high.</li>
    <li> My husband has the frizziest and thickest hair ever,  If works wonderfully on him and finally his hair looks really cool. Yeah!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this because the product description said it would protect my hair from humidity. This product did not work for that, and it left this strange smell in my hair.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell much but my niece said her hair felt softer than it use to and she liked it</li>
    <li> We only got it yesterday so I don&#x27;t know what the long term effect will be, but it smells yummy and there were no frizzies upon first use</li>
    <li> Includes carcinogenic chemicals such as parabens. I bought it hastily without checking the ingredients. Won&#x27;t be using it.</li>
    <li> good product for styling... I use with my blower brush, works well  I would reccommend it, especially for very fine thin hair</li>
    <li> This product smells very clean, like something in a salon. I can&#x27;t place it though. Like with all heat protectants, I never know if they are protecting well. I like the sprayer, and the fact that you can lock it. That&#x27;s helpful when you have little brothers. I don&#x27;t use it as directed. You are supposed to spray it into damp hair and blowdry and straighten. I don&#x27;t blowdry my hair so I just spray it in and let it dry a bit before straightening. It does not leave my fine hair greasy. Its supposed to help with frizz also, but all I really have is flyaways and baby hairs so I don&#x27;t notice any less frizz. Doesn&#x27;t help flyaways or baby hairs that I notice. Might repurchace because it was cheap, but I like to try new products.&lt;br /&gt;Four stars because this was the first one I&#x27;ve tried and I can&#x27;t compare it to anything. Plus I was hoping for flyaway help:(.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel that protect my hair, I suppose it do it that. The indications says to aplicate on dry hair before to use heat, but the hair get a little wet, so, when I use my iron I hear Shrshsrhshhs!!! like something burned. I think the directions of this product must be more specific. Smell very well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit smaller than I expected but I does seem to be working on my hair. I gave it a four star because its kinda smaller than I expected</li>
    <li> I can now blow dry my hair using only a round brush as opposed to feel I have to use a hair iron to fix my &amp;#34;frizzies,&amp;#34; and Lalso have noticed an improvement to the health of my hair when combined with the natural hair coloring I started using at about the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an important time saver for me as I have baby fine, thin hair that tends to kink and frizz. I&#x27;ve also noticed that while my hair still kinks to some extent when I get overheated while wearing my riding helmet, it no longer frizzes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m happy with the results, I removed a star because of the long list of chemical additives. I still search for an organic product that works.</li>
    <li> I like the spray, but i rather have the cream but the spay is ok</li>
    <li> Really nice because it was a gift for my purchase the product is very nice and good quality!!! i like it very much!</li>
    <li> Hair type: I have naturally wavy, frizz-prone hair. I live in a humid climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this with a hair dryer/straightener, and does a pretty good job. I have my doubts about its longevity - it certainly does not keep my hair smooth and frizz-free for half as long as the bottle claims (24 hours). It will, however, get me through a typical work day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the sprayer - it releases a nice mist that allows me to cover a lot of hair. Also, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling tacky or stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this product and will continue to use it -- but I am going to continue to search for the holy grail of heat protectants.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Use my InStyler almost every day and this product helps keep hair shiny and burn-free!</li>
    <li> I use it just in case on my human hair wigs and on my hair before I press it.  I can&#x27;t see a big difference I just hope it is working and protecting my hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this product when she uses her curling iron and it has done a fabulous job of protecting her long hair from damage.</li>
    <li> I have very light, fine hair. This is the only product I have found that is not super priced that does not make my hair clumped and heavy. Makes my hair smooth, less frizzy and remains light.</li>
    <li> I use this every time I blow dry and flat iron my hair. No matter how high I set the heat, my hair does not frizz and stays sleek and shiny for hours. It smells nice and isn&#x27;t heavy. I have fine/thin hair and this product doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, even if I over spray it! Great product...you should buy it!</li>
    <li> This is about the same as any other product that I have used that protects hair from heat. It&#x27;s good for all types of hair, but I don&#x27;t feel like it works that well.</li>
    <li> I really like using this, and I always take it with me if I travel! I can tell a difference if I use it than if I don&#x27;t, I do have a few other heat protection products, and I switch it up depending on what I am doing to my hair...&lt;br /&gt;I normally use this if the weather is bad-raining ect since it keeps the frizz down, which is a big plus, that is my main reason for using this product, and it does work GREAT for frizz!!!&lt;br /&gt;the item is as described, and works well. I take it when I travel so I have something with me since I don&#x27;t know what the weather will be where I am at... I always like to have it with me!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anybody, especially those that struggle with frizz!!!</li>
    <li> I like  this product ...works great for my hair issues. i have reccommedned to friends . will order again in the future. I appreciate this product on line .  Thanks for your prompt delivery</li>
    <li> This was for my daughter, she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Neva Squires-Rodriguez Author of The Liliana Series&lt;br /&gt;Read &amp;#34;Liliana&amp;#34; a Contemporary Suspense-Filled Romance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming Soon:&lt;br /&gt;Two phenomonel Christmas Stories with Co Author Tamara Philip, Title yet to be relased.  Check my Author page around Thanksgiving for more info.</li>
    <li> I think this product works great for the price. I have used more expensive brands but they leave my hair feeling heavy or greasy so I went back to this one. I don&#x27;t straighten my hair daily but I think it offers great protection from the heat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and highly recommend it for no frizz hair whether air drying or using a blow dryer.</li>
    <li> After coloring my hair for years, and now blow drying and flat ironing my hair everyday for the last month (after a new haircut,) I noticed my hair was starting to look damaged. Skeptical that these products even worked, I searched for a brand that got a lot of good reviews, no matter the cost. I was pleasantly surprised to find this product, and so inexpensive! This heat protectant does work, it smells good before and after using heat, and it left my hair soft and feeling better then when I started! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a leave-in product to use with my new ceramic hair straightening wand that would protect my hair, and I did read these reviews, but liked these three facts: 1)  It&#x27;s John Frieda 2) The cost was terrific and 3) it helped curb the frizzies in humid weather! I just used it and I really like the very even spray this bottle delivers, it has little or no scent, and if it does, it is light; and wait for it.......IT LEAVES YOUR HAIR LIKE IT HAD TWICE THE VOLUME....no greasy feel like so many other leave-ins, and nice and straight, without looking thin and whispy as so many oily products do. I love this and will be ordering it from now on, forever. Again, another amazing product from Amazon: my shopping site for &#x27;everything&#x27;! PS: those of you who say it does not help very kinky, curly hair; understand, it takes a \\&quot;relaxer\\&quot; and a professional salon treatment to change the inherent nature of cultural hair. Don&#x27;t expect over the top changes; but for the average head of hair that needs help with humidity, volume and a straight style, this IS the product to purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product , it does protect my hair from the heat of the blow dryer , and give it extra shine</li>
    <li> It makes my hair crunchy and hard...terrible and did nothing to help with heat protection at all or to help to give volume. Just bad.</li>
    <li> In one application I noticed less frizz and in the winter, no more flyaway hair. No funny smell to deal with either.</li>
    <li> I guess with these products it is just down to personal choice and product loyalty.  This is no better or no worse than any other protective spray on the market.  I do like the Freida products but am not sure I would buy it again.  I am more apt to try some other product--always looking for that magic potion.</li>
    <li> This primer is the real deal! I use to use expensive salon brand primers. This outbeat them! Its great from the spray bottle to the great clean smell. I have straight thick hair thats frizz alot. This product worked wonders with my frizz.  I would suggest the  use of this product is after wash and before blow dry or straight iron. Don&#x27;t think it was design for dry hair. It does give the hair a wet  feel so use before your drying process.</li>
    <li> I have fine, super frizzy hair. John Frieda products have been &#x27;hair saving&#x27;. I always use Frizz Ease Protective before using any appliance on my hair.</li>
    <li> John Frieda&#x27;s Frizz Ease line has some pretty amazing products it it, and this is one of my favorites.  I love the product, and it arrived very fast as well!</li>
    <li> It smells really good and It does a good job protecting your hair from the heat. Has a nice spray mist for even coverage makes me feel like a professional stylist when I spray it! lol</li>
    <li> Great before you blow dry, use it everyday, my hair is in great shape because of this! Absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> smell nice but a little sticky! good product</li>
    <li> I read great things about this product before I bought it. It helps to manage my very think and slightly frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Great product and material.&lt;br /&gt;It was just what i ordered and am very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone, great buy. Love it</li>
    <li> First of all, I recommend this spray(and the rest of John Frieda&#x27;s products), it works really well and makes my hair feel and look great after a blow dry... Emphasis on blow dry. I purchased this thinking that it was meant to be used before ALL heated hair appliances, but after reading the back of the bottle I learned that was not the case. THIS SPRAY IS INTENDED FOR BLOW DRYS ONLY. As long as you&#x27;re aware of this, I suggest this product completely.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps. Happy shopping. ❤</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me.  Wish I hadn&#x27;t been tempted to purchase it.  It is also difficult to hold and spray</li>
    <li> I love this spray because when I spray this to my hair, it doesn&#x27;t just go on one spot with a stream, it sprays it like a mist so it goes to other parts of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It also goes in my hair pretty fast which is good because I could straighten/curl my hair much quicker.&lt;br /&gt;Def. recommended!</li>
    <li> My hair is really fine and when I dry it, it frizzes. I spray this before drying, and it really helps control this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other WalMart products that have worked better at reviving my hair and caming the frizz for less money so it didn&#x27;t help me much</li>
    <li> Wife says &amp;#34;does not seem to help hair much, but it smells nice&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I use this when my hair is wet and then blow dry.  I also use before I flat iron my hair.  I really like it because it is not sticky, doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, and dries quickly.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this heat spray. The great news is it helps wet my hair a little when it dried too much before blow drying. I love that it did not make my hair feel sticky. I had no notice of it weighing my hair down it was so light and airy. When I finished blow drying my hair felt soft manageable and I love that my hair is protected. I love this product and wish I had found it sooner. Such a surprise.</li>
    <li> This bottle sprays the styling gel with a very fine mist instead of a stream like most of the other styling sprays. This means it is distributed on the hair much more evenly. I have found that I don&#x27;t need to wash my hair quite as often when using this spray. It keeps my hair looking fresh for at least three days.</li>
    <li> I like this - doesn&#x27;t weight my fine hair down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with frizz for years and this is the one product that really works!  I used it this morning and 4 hours later I got caught in the rain, typically my hair would&#x27;ve frizzed out but not today!  I have the conditioner also - because it works :)&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived fast and was packaged well, I will order from this vender again!</li>
    <li> Use to help protect hair from blow drying.  Makes it nice and sleek afterwards.</li>
    <li> LOVE this spray. Works wonders on your hair. Helps improve with each use. GOOD price too</li>
    <li> weighs my hair down if i use more than 6-7 squirts (i have a bob, slightly below my chin).  moderation is the key, apparently.  otherwise, i don&#x27;t have complaints.</li>
    <li> Great product.My hair is more managable.</li>
    <li> I have tried many heat protectants but none seem to work as well as this one. I would highly recommend it. It is great for all hair types.</li>
    <li> Gave it to Mom with her first straightener, does the trick!</li>
    <li> highly recommend if you use a lot of ironing products.  it works well for brittle hair or course, fine hair.</li>
    <li> At last I have found a heat protectant for my hair that doesn&#x27;t make it greasy or have a bad smell. I really like this spray and I haven&#x27;t had split ends since I started using it a few months ago &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> It is not something that I want to use and I am definitely not going to write a paragraph about a product that I would ever&lt;br /&gt;purchase again.  It was a waste of money in my opinion and you can take that to the bank.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5 years and I noticed a difference in my hair. I blow dry and straighten my hair every single day and I always apply this heat protecting spray generously before styling. Although due to the amount of damage I put my hair throufht it can&#x27;t be flawless, however I can see that it&#x27;s not as fried and dull like it was before I started to use thus product. One bottle lasts me about 4-5 months, and I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I make a habit of writing \\&quot;Dry\\&quot; or \\&quot;Damp\\&quot; with a Sharpie on my hair products so I don&#x27;t have to look for the directions each time I use a different product.  I knew this one said damp, but I took a chance and used it on dry hair.  Loved it!!!  No matter what I use on wet hair before blow-drying, it&#x27;s just not enough.  Plus, I&#x27;m impatient, and hate blow-drying my longish blonde hair till it&#x27;s smooth.  I use this now before my InStyler or flatiron, and I&#x27;m getting great results.  Much smoother, much less frizz as the day goes on.  Looks even better when I use it again the second day.  I still use a product that&#x27;s meant for damp hair before I blow-dry, then this after it&#x27;s dry. I spray each section immediately before using the styling tool.  When I was much younger I had naturally straight, smooth hair.  Through the years it&#x27;s gotten slightly drier (probably from styling tools) and slightly coarser (probably from age!)  I just reordered this because I like it so much.  I&#x27;m usually \\&quot;on to the next new thing,\\&quot; so that&#x27;s saying a lot.  My hair is color-treated, and it leaves it shiny and not weighed down.  I even spray a little extra on the ends.</li>
    <li> I use it daily to make my hair look smoother.  It is not always possible to find it in my local stores so I am very pleased that it is available at Amazon.com.My hair is fine and easily &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34;  This helps keep it tame and, though not perfect, it is the best product that I have found.</li>
    <li> This product works well. Nice alternative to more expensive brand.</li>
    <li> Used for a few weeks now and do not notice any difference in my hair.  It does smell good, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Love the product and how quickly it shipped! I don&#x27;t have dry hair, but would like to keep it that way, and this has helped greatly!</li>
    <li> I feel like the alcohol in the product damages my hair , the frizz is there when I use the product</li>
    <li> This product works great . I spray it on may wet hair and style with the the styling brush . My hair is frizz free  and very soft and shinny . It stays soft and shinny the next day too. I will probaly keep using this product.</li>
    <li> product works really well. i have thick frizzy hair and takes forever to blow dry but with this it dries faster and looks so much better. def will buy again</li>
