<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> First experienced this product after a foil.  Let my hair so soft, shiny and very healthy looking.  This is so much better then Biosilk Silk Therapy which I used for years.  Moroccan Oil Light has a light scent to it which is also not overpowering.  Would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Item as described. I personally do not like the smell but it helped soothe some of the frizziness in my hair</li>
    <li> Helps make hair smoother and less frizzy. I&#x27;ve also heard it aids with hair growth, but am not sure about that.</li>
    <li> This product is great...My hair is not dried out any more and it smells good too</li>
    <li> I love it the best oil get it worth the price I love it so much I love it . The best oil for your hair</li>
    <li> product is great and the service was faSt - appreciate receiving it - will buy again and probably bigger quanity next time.</li>
    <li> Perfect product, perfect delivery. Thrilled!</li>
    <li> I use this product at the end of the day to give my hair moisture.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found a travel size Moroccan Oil! I&#x27;ve been hooked on this since trying it several months ago. A little goes a long way. I have fine straight hair and many products make my hair appear more oily, but this product does not. It can be used in wet hair before blow drying or as a finishing product to create a smooth look. My only complaint is about the packaging. I wish it came with a pump of some sort like the larger size.</li>
    <li> The only thing that&#x27;s ever tamed my frizz. No oily feel once hair is dry.</li>
    <li> This is a really good oil to use as a heat protectant as well as for sealing in the moisture. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a five is because it has silicones in it. Other than that it is great and it smells AMAZING!</li>
    <li> I have been using the regular Moroccanoil for a long time, but it does build up in my hair, so I tried this &#x27;light&#x27; version.  It is slightly lighter, both in viscosity and color.  I will see how it does over time on the build up.</li>
    <li> GREAT STUFF - don&#x27;t hesitate - great after washing hair for the super shine - not oily - just a nice shine.  Moroccan oil great for treated hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent to use before blow drying. Helps correct damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I had really high expectations for this product and it hasn&#x27;t lived up to them, my hair is definitely less dry, but i&#x27;m not sure i notice much of a difference between this and other products.  I think the non-light one might be better, but I have light colored, thick hair, so I was more concerned about it darkening my hair than I was for it not being strong enough. If you&#x27;re noticing a lot of dry ends, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST HAIR PRODUCT EVER!! I have bleached part of my hair and tinted it blue. The rest of my hair is black. Because of the bleaching, my hair was FRIED! This is the only product that provides all day-multiple days of moisture WITHOUT making my hair greasy. All other products have maid my hair oily and nasty. Especially any argon oil bought at salons or beauty supply stores. Don&#x27;t buy other brands claiming to be the same!!!! They aren&#x27;t! My hair is naturally oily after skipping a day to wash so any other product makes it horrible. This product doesn&#x27;t. Get it and keep using forever!!!</li>
    <li> After reading great things about this product and then having my hair stylist actually try it on my hair, I decided to purchase a small bottle of the Moroccan Oil Light.  I have fine hair, but A LOT of it...  so I thought the Light formula would be best for my hair.  I use it conservatively, as not to weigh my hair down when I blow it out.  I have been moderately happy with the product.  It does seem to smooth fly-aways and makes my hair nice and shiny.  I honestly have to say that I still prefer my Kerastase Thermique, though.</li>
    <li> I could not tell that this product made any difference in my hair. It smells good and is easy to use. It is hard to find products that will prevent frizz in this humid Louisiana air!</li>
    <li> I got this for travel so I dont have to carry around big bottle, this oil is amazing, this little bottle will last you the long time, thank you to whomever came out with this product !</li>
    <li> This product is excellent.  Makes hair silky, shiny and soft.  Careful not to use too much.  Just a little dab will do &#x27;ya!</li>
    <li> I have been looking around for a product to help fight frizz from the Houston humidity.  I have long fine and somewhat thin blonde hair.  As I have gotten older (and more gray-which is colored)I have had more frizzies.  I started using the Moroccan Light oil about a month ago and noticed an positive instant difference in my hair&#x27;s texture and how fast it dries as well as styling.  I only use about a dime-sized amount and rub my hands well to warm it and distribute it evenly thru combed out semi-toweled dried hair.  I start at the ends and work my way up so that the last of the product is up near the roots.  This prevents an over greasy look/feel.  I let the product sit while I put on the rest of my makeup then blow out my hair then flat-iron.  Sometimes I use a little after flat-ironing just at the ends to soften them up if they still feel dry.  My hair looks thicker, holds the style (without the frizz) and smells great throughout the day and into the next.  I do recommend this product but remember that a little goes a long way.  I will update this come July/August when the heat &amp; humidity is at it&#x27;s worst here.  Hopefully, the product will still be as effective.</li>
    <li> I would say that even though I have fine hair that I should have ordered the moroccan oil.  Over all it&#x27;s a good product and smells great.  It took longer to ship than I had expected.  I will order the morroccan oil.</li>
    <li> This oil smells amazing and makes your hair feel awesome. I especially like to place it at the back under all my layers, it seems to keep it tangle free.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine and not really damaged and while this might be good for curly hair or over processed hair I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I use this product as I have very frizzy hair. The oil moisturizes my hair and tames it down, making it looks so much nicer</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. I need to figure out what the right amount is to use on my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. For years I used other &amp;#34;smoothing&amp;#34; hair products from the salon and then tried this and I love it. It smells awesome and is more natural like you own hair oils. It adds just enough weight so your hair lays nicely and looks shiny, not dry.</li>
    <li> Great product. Just right for my fine and processed hair.  I use it everyday and my hair looks and feels great that my coworkers keep asking me what have I done to it.  I would recommend this product to all. Thanks for having it!</li>
    <li> Too greasy!Better pure organ oil for taming frizz!</li>
    <li> Now that I&#x27;ve tried the light, I prefer the original formula over the light.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product.  Even though it&#x27;s very expensive, you only use a tiny bit at a time, so it lasts for many months.  I love that it&#x27;s so light on the hair so that the hair never feels oily. Just touch the top of the open bottle to your palm and the little that stays on your palm is often enough. In very humid weather, you may need a little more, but don&#x27;t go overboard with it.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have fine blonde hair and it doesn&#x27;t make your hair gummy or weighed down. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!! I have very fine hair that is very frizzy, that is, until I apply barely a drop of this fabulous oil to my dampened hair! My hair goes from frizzy to silky appearing with curls instead of frizz! It takes only a tiny amount to get fantastic results! It has a nice smell that goes away once applied. I love it and can&#x27;t imagine being without it now!</li>
    <li> This is expensive, but it does amazing things for your hair!  I bought these for my daughters for their stocking stuffers</li>
    <li> I have really fine hair and this product works great. And, smells so nice ....I want to buy everything now.</li>
    <li> I used this right before I straigten hair.  Adds a nice sheen and helps prevent more breakage.  My hair is very damaged from over coloring</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife.  She said it worked great and that it was well worthwhile.  I do the ordering even though many of the items are for the wife.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let anyone tell you that your hair is too fine to use Moroccan Oil! I have baby fine hair and stylists are forever telling me that Moroccan Oil is too heavy for my hair and will weigh it down. This formulation, used sparingly, provides smoothness and shine without making your hair look oily or as if it is plastered to your head.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product! My hair was seriously fried and for the past few days I have been using it, it&#x27;s texture is improving.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and works great</li>
    <li> I first was introduced to Moroccan oil at my hairdresser. I have been using it since...I love the way it makes my hair look, feel and smell.</li>
    <li> Great before you blow dry your hair. It protects your hair from the heat. I love this product. My hair feels much healthier since I have been using it.</li>
    <li> l love moroccan oil! it is VERY price but great product! loved small size since l am always losing my stuff</li>
    <li> I ordered the light but I actually received the regular.</li>
    <li> Really works great after you have a perm.  I can use this and just let my hair dry and it looks great!!!  Would highly recommend the Light for people with fine hair.</li>
    <li> This costly little serum made no difference in my hair. It has a pleasant smell, it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, neither did it improve the appearance of manageability of my hair.</li>
    <li> It does not matter what type of hair you have this product will help it behave better.  Especially if you are drying your hair out with a flat iron.  This product will allow you to blow dry your hair and achieve the same smooth look you are trying to get with an iron everyday,</li>
    <li> I love Moroccanoil and I just got my hair highlighted so I thought I would try this product.  Just as good as the original!      Heidi</li>
    <li> Exactly as it is in stores.  Love this Product!!  I have fine hair and this is the perfct balance. Not too heavy.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this and fell in love with it. I have thin hair and normally can&#x27;t use oil products but a dime size amount of this on my damp hair creates such a silky shine I love it.</li>
    <li> Love that product !!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It makes my hair so shiny and silky. I prefer to use it after blowdrying instead of before. I put a small amount in my hands then wisp it through my hair.</li>
    <li> Very light, nice fragrance, really helps control my hair. I wish this size came with a dropper to control the flow.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly, fine, blonde hair. I have been using oils in my hair for the past 5 years. This has to be one of the worst oils I have used, and I&#x27;ve used other argan oils. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I was not happy after giving it a fair go for a week. By mid-day my hair would be stringy and greasy looking every day, which was not cute. Oils that do this to my hair tend to work better when I&#x27;m in tropical regions so I&#x27;m going to keep it for traveling... but just a word of warning to other ladies who have my kind of hair! Try and see if you can get a sample from a salon or the website before you buy an entire bottle like me.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! It has been wonderful for my hair. This small travel size was a great way to try it before purchasing a full size bottle!!! I love it!! And as a bonus it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> My wife bought a full size bottle on a cruise and loved the product.  So she was very happy to find this perfect travel size to take in place of the larger bottle, especially with airline size restrictions.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best hair serum I have ever used and I have tried several knock offs.  Nothing comes close to the smoothing and repair this offers.</li>
    <li> Its pretty good same stuff just smells a little off but works and is cheap great alternative for the pricey one (its the same stuff)</li>
    <li> This is the best.  Blond color.keep it in good shape..does not weigh down or darken....i love this product very much.</li>
    <li> I found this through my stylist, and got a great price on Amazon. This is great stuff, I only need a tiny bit, but it smooths the fly-aways and gives my straight, fine hair shine and luster without weighing it down or making it oily. I recommend it to everyone who has dry ends or fly-aways. Put it in your hair when its wet, comb thru and dry as usual. You can also rub it through your finished style to tame any strays.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Nice product.</li>
    <li> I love Morocan oil.  It makes my hair so easy to comb through and never feels oily  just healthly Glad I tried the Treatment Light  will continue to purchase again and again from Amazon</li>
    <li> I have very, very fine blond hair which I have been wearing longer than usual.  I was having terrible problems with breakage and damage.  Moroccanoil was recommended.  Rub the tiniest amount between your hands and then rub your hands through the lower half of your hair after every shampoo.  I am now on my 4th (?) bottle each of which lasts approximately 6 months each.  My hair is much easier to manage.  It detangles easily and static electricity in the winter time is no longer a problem.  Other than making my hair softer it is undetectable.  I now use the Moroccanoil Shampoo and Conditioner as well since I like the oil so much.</li>
    <li> LOVVEEEE this stuff - I always put it on after a blow dry to shape and hydrate my hair - in turn my hair looks soooooooo shiny in photos</li>
    <li> This was a great price for an amazing product. If you haven&#x27;t tried Moroccan Oil before, you are missing out on a miracle! The light version is wonderful for thin/oily hair and smells like heaven!</li>
    <li> Moroccan Oil LIGHT is amazing. It beats every other expensive hair care product I&#x27;ve ever used.  My hair is fine textured, but thick, salt and pepper grey with a few added light blond streaks.  Also it is incredibly effected by humidity.  This gives me the best control over it I&#x27;ve ever had.  It leaves no residue and adds shine and manageability with only a very tiny amount of product, so lasts forever.  Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Very good consistence to apply in blond hair, promotes hydration and frizz less. The smell is so good! Only the price is not good...</li>
    <li> I love it works well and came so perfectly packaged im ordering more soon</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for a couple months now and it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much. It doesn&#x27;t seem to change the appearance of my hair, nor does it feel as soft as other oils&#x27; I&#x27;ve tried in past. I would not buy this again, if I did maybe just not the light.</li>
    <li> Works amazingly on my daughter&#x27;s hair. She&#x27;s 3 years old and gets a dry scalp occassionally.&lt;br /&gt;Since I started using the Moroccan Oil she has had no issues. The light works great, much better on her hair&lt;br /&gt;than the regular moroccan oil. The regular Moroccan oil is a little heavy for her hair but still took care of her dry scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and the entire line of Moroccan Oil.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair soft and smooth! Love this product!</li>
    <li> Love this product! The smell is divine for me, I love catching whiffs of it throughout the day. It gives my hair moisture and integrity without weighing it down, and it feels soft and luxurious. I bought the small bottle at first to try, just ordered the big bottle a few days ago because I&#x27;m out! Totally worth the money, im obsessed.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I use it as directed, and it makes my hair look beautiful and feel smooth and  silky. If anybody is affraid that the hair would look oily, I promise, it doesn&#x27;t. It absorbs instantly. You can reapply to refresh of you need as well.</li>
    <li> All natural product and cruelty free.  The light formula is better suited for blonde hair.  Recommend applying on damp hair before blow drying. It helps to seal in the oil when the hair shaft is still open.</li>
    <li> My hair is very damaged and this stuff helps me get a brush through it w out feeling greasy. Smells great and I would buy it again should it be on sale.</li>
    <li> Much cheaper at Amazon! Packaged well. I like Moraccan Oil light. First I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t give me enuf conditioning. But it does. I have fine hi lited blond hair. This product really cuts down on hair drying time. I use a little on wet hair and when I&#x27;m done styling I use a little more all over it brings out more shine and condoning. I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do this w the original oil. I really like the light. A lot of shops don&#x27;t carry it.</li>
    <li> Got the product right away!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple years.  My hair is long and fine, so it usually sucks up any oily-type product and looks dirty.  I use a dime-sized amount on my wet hair, starting at the ends and ending with the roots.  People compliment how shiny my hair is all the time.  Just start with a small amount, you can always add more while you figure out how much is the perfect amount for your hair.  The small bottle lasts me at least 6 months.</li>
    <li> Moroccanoil was suggested by my stylist in an upscale salon.  I came on here and got it much less expensively.&lt;br /&gt;This oil is great for smooth hair and giving it a healthy look and feel.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  I put a small amount on my ends before blow drying it and it helps with the fly away hair making the hair nice and smooth.  Even after blowing out your hair if you put a small amount on to help smooth out your hair, your hair will look great.</li>
    <li> It leaves hair soft and the product is so light I loved it.  Unlike the other products from this manufacturer I have tried,  I highly reccomend this one.</li>
    <li> I must have this &amp;#34;Light&amp;#34; travel size version with me at all times. One in my car, one in my workout bag, one in my purse and of course I keep several bottles of the 6.8oz. on-hand at home. This product has done wonders for keeping my hair moisturized! Nothing compares.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this oil, if you have sisters worry about hair problem, it would be a good small gift for them</li>
    <li> LOVE IT DOES A GOOD JOB ON MY HAIR AND SKIN&lt;br /&gt;WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANY ONE THAT HAS DRY SKIN OR HAIR</li>
    <li> Due to many medications that dry out my hair, this item came to the rescue and revived it!  Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Works wonders on my hair and it smells absolutely amazing! I Will order the larger size next time!!</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever. Mix with your styling product</li>
    <li> Great product for anyone who needs taming their hair. doesn&#x27;t weigh it down too much but must use sparingly.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and have always loved it.  I tried to order it here to save a buck.  When it arrived, I did notice that it was more runny than my previous bottle I used (yes, both were light since my hair is fine and blonde).  It wasn&#x27;t until recently that I noticed that my bottle expired almost a year ago.  Not Cool!  I&#x27;m paying primo $ for expired products?  BOOO!!!</li>
    <li> i tried the maroccan oil light two months ago and it really works for me and i can say it is the perfect product ever seen in my life</li>
    <li> works great on my hair. I have blonde hair and I feel that it works the way that it says it does. love the smell and the way my hair feels after I apply the product.</li>
    <li> I love it! I use a dime-sized amount daily. It really makes my hair shine. It looks and feels fuller.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Love that kind of brand!!! Perfect for my hair and so soft!!! Love it!</li>
    <li> Great price but very slow shipping</li>
    <li> How did it take me so long to find out about Morroccan Oil. My daughter has long, blonde, but very fine hair that tangles easily. Brushing her hair used to be a nightmare. Now, I can just rub a tiny bit of this oil into her hair after a shampoo and her hair brush or comb slides right through her hair. It makes it very shiny and silky too. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Makes my hair smell so good, makes it easier to comb, my hair looks &amp; feels so healthy. It arrived very fast &amp; was packed well. I am thinking of giving out as Christmas gifts to a couple of friends.</li>
    <li> Great product to help with split ends for my fine, frail hair.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly dry fine hair. When I first discovered moraccan oil it was like a miracle product. The light however does absolutely nothing for my hair. I won&#x27;t be buying this product through amazon again OR buying the &#x27;light&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I have loved the original Moroccan Oil since the very first time I tried it.  I have fine and light-colored hair, but did not find this product to work better for my hair type than the original.  In fact, I found it to be less effective.  Perhaps it&#x27;s because my hair is fairly dry from processing and styling, but I did not find this product to be hydrating enough.  It didn&#x27;t do enough to tame my frizz like the original does.  This product does still smell nice and might work fine for someone with normal to oily hair.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser suggested this product when I asked for something to put more shine in my hair.  I love it!  The fragrance is wonderful and so is the shine.</li>
    <li> Good product. Came just in time.</li>
    <li> excellent price, very fast shipment, what can you get more?</li>
    <li> I definitely notice a difference with my frizz control in this particular product particularly! If only it wasn&#x27;t so expensive...</li>
    <li> My hair is soft, shinny and smells good from using this product.</li>
    <li> Hair stylists have been trying to get me to use Moroccan Oil for years but I found it too oily for my soft, fine hair. It weighed down my hair and made it look unclean. As I&#x27;ve aged though, my hair has become drier, so I tried Moroccan Oil again at the suggestion of my stylist.  It helped with the dry ends but still made my hair feel and look oily.  By accident I bought Moroccan Oil \\&quot;LIGHT\\&quot; online (I didn&#x27;t know there was more than one kind) and it&#x27;s fantastic!  It does everything it claims without being heavy or sticky.  I use it on my wet hair before stying to control frizzies but I also use it on my hair between shampoos to refresh my curls and keep it soft without making it oily!  I wish I had known about the Moroccan LIGHT before!  Now I know why everyone loves it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful!  I thought I would try the light version because I don&#x27;t like the heavy oil film, but it actually feels so good in my hair, not heavy and sticky at all!  It looks like it gave my dried out frizzy hair some much needed shine.  I love it and I think I may even try the original!  I bought the travel size just to give it a try, and I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Was received packed very securely and in a timely manner. Product lasts a long time, cost very reasonable. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> It is okay, not quiet happy with the quality, feels a little watery...</li>
    <li> I have very fine, oily hair, but it tangles horribly and the ends get very unhealthy because I have to wash it every day or the oils build up. Despite this being MORE OIL, it does wonders for my hair. I just don&#x27;t apply it to the roots. I use a dime-sized amount, rub it on my hands, and finger-comb the lower portion of my hair, which is down past my shoulder blades. It smells wonderful, makes my hair super-soft, and the tiny bottle lasts ages.</li>
    <li> Gives great shine and hold to the hair without greasing it.</li>
    <li> Old white hair looks like well old white hair.  Moroccan Oil Light for Fine and Light colored hair is spectacular.  Costs is well outwayed by the very small amount you need to use and the amazing shine it adds.  Use several drops after shampoo while damp.  Many immitations so be careful to get the Moroccan Oil that costs more it is well worth the difference.  Bonus, it really smells nice too, and is nice on dry skin in the winter too.</li>
    <li> I have a ton of wavy and unruly hair, and I love Moroccanoil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I do almost nothing to it, I have yet to own a blow dryer. But this is my secret to healthy looking hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the oil itself is exotic, sweet, and rapturous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not using another brand of hair products.</li>
    <li> Light and does not leave hair with an oily finish. Smooths flyaways and frizz. Adds shine and gloss to dull lifeless hair.</li>
    <li> Moroccan Oil light is a great product for people with fine hair.  People with dry scalp have to apply more than one pump of the light but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Love this product for fine straight hair.  A tiny amount makes my ends look shiny and very finished.  You don&#x27;t need much product at all so I buy the smallest bottle and it last a long time.  Smells like petchuli oil….which I don&#x27;t mind since I&#x27;m a little hippy at heart.</li>
    <li> if you have very dry or processed hair (I bleach mine now) your hair will absorb this fast, which means your hair likes it, but you feel like you have to keep using more &amp; more. My wallet doesnt like that. it smells great &amp; all that but there are absolutely other products out there that are more affordable that give more substantial results.</li>
    <li> I love the product!I love the product! my hair, thin and oily, but this product was very light. recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair very manageable and shiny.  I use it with the Morroccanoil  Gold Shimmer Shinte</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to smell good as long as the regular strength does.</li>
    <li> This product is worth every penny.  I have long hair and I put this on after every wash.  The oil adds shine and really helps with detangling.</li>
    <li> I have really thin hair and its great for shine and as a moisturizer. There is no caking or sticky feeling.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product after hearing about it on Facebook and You Tube.  I had become unhappy that my conditioner made my long hair seemed heavy and flat.  So I purchased a sample of Moroccan Oil Light and put a dime size amount through my hair after washing it.  I was pleasantly surprised at the wonderful scent and how healthy my hair felt.  I find that it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  I&#x27;ll be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> I was told this stuff was the best thing to use on my extensions, there are cheaper versions at Ulta that work the same.</li>
    <li> I was impressed with the timely arrival of my order. The Moroccan oil was everything I expected from the description</li>
    <li> This Product -  Is Amazing - - It does not weigh your hair down - helps keep it  shinny -  You can use it every day  ...&lt;br /&gt;Love it -</li>
    <li> Meh meh, meh meh meh, meh, meh, meh meh.....It&#x27;s just okay, nothing special really.  I like the regular oil better.  My hair type is fine, dry &amp; curly</li>
    <li> I have very fine and oily hair, but my ends get torn up from styling, so this is a great product for me.  does not leave my hair feeling oily or disgusting but takes care of my fly aways, frizz, and broken ends</li>
    <li> My hair is so incredibly sleek and smooth after applying this. I put it on every other day after the shower and it smells fabulous as well. I have had strangers comment on my hair smelling good after wearing this. It has a wonderful almost incense type of smell.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping</li>
    <li> makes my hair feel and look healthy, easy to comb hair. would highly recommend this product to anyone thank you</li>
    <li> This travel size is perfect to try this product if you&#x27;ve never used it before; the regular size is very pricey if you&#x27;re unsure about it.  But this is a great product for fine hair thats needs some moisturizing treatment.</li>
    <li> I like the Moroccan Oil for my hair, which tends to be dry and gets frizzy in humid weather. It smooths hair  nicely and smells great! It works very well on my children&#x27;s hair as well.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this product and I fell in love with it immediately.  It makes hair shiny and manageable plus it smells great!  The price is great.  My hairdresser charged more than twice this price!</li>
    <li> I like this light hair oil.  My hair is finely textured and I have to be very careful with the amount that I use, but when I get it right my hair looks pretty, shiny and it helps with static.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t perform miracles...didn&#x27;t seem to absorb into my hair the way it did for other reviewers...ended up giving it away...</li>
    <li> I love this oil!  The fine and light-colored hair oil is perfect...not heavy, and it leaves hair soft and shiny. I use it every time I shampoo&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love Moroccan Oil..  I always used the darker Moroccan, but tried the lights since I have light hair and love it.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product, I have been using it for years! It works great on color treated and damaged hair.</li>
    <li> the moroccan oil light treatment was as advertised, and you don&#x27;t need a lot of it. I use it on my wet and dry hair.</li>
    <li> High quality product.</li>
    <li> IT works pretty good, love the smell.  I have noticed my hair is much shinier, however I only put it on the ends because I have fine, oily hair and dont&#x27; need any extra oil.</li>
    <li> This product conditions my hair better than any thing else. My hair is silky and shiny. Frizzies are gone.  It smells heavenly! Perfect for fine, wavy blonde hair.</li>
    <li> Great product, love it the difference I can tell when I use it. I will purchase again in the future :)</li>
    <li> Perfect! I will buy this until it is no longer sold, which I hope will be never! It works well and I get complements all the time.</li>
    <li> The best product for dry and dull hair!! I dry my hair until still a little damp, rub very small amount in dry areas and ends and dry completely. My hair looks healthy and shiny! Love it!!</li>
    <li> What captured me at first was the wonderful smell. This lovely oil helps tame my dry, frizzy hair, leaving it less likely to break, and giving it a nice shine.</li>
    <li> makes my hair slick, soft and shiny; very lightweight!  I have very fine hair and it does not weigh it down.</li>
    <li> So I can&#x27;t say I can compare this light version to the regular one, because I haven&#x27;t used the regular one. This variety of oil works very well for my fine and thin hair. A little goes a long way. I typically only use it closer to the ends. Sometimes I use it as a hot oil treatment in the shower and then wash my hair. It makes the hair very soft without the greasy feeling and I feel like as I am using it my hair is getting healthier (feels better, has more natural shine, etc)</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! It makes my hair very soft and helps it shine. It also helps my hair dry faster under the blow dryer. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I had heard about Moroccanoil but never used it because I have baby fine, highlighted hair.  I ordered this small trial size and I love it. My hair is in wonderful condition now.  I smooth about a nickel size through the ends every day and it does not weigh my hair down.  I especially like to use this before any blow drying.  This is a new go to product.</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes my hair so soft to the touch! I only got the travel size so I can take it w/ me on my travels.</li>
    <li> The best oil in the world, no other company could produce a product similiar to this one. It´s not cheap but it is worth.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff! It keeps my ends healthy and shiny. I love it and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Works better than all the morocan oil products.</li>
    <li> It feels good for dry scalp.</li>
    <li> I use it just on the ends of my hair (a dab on each of five fingers) aong with Paradise Island shampoo. My hair has never looked so good!</li>
    <li> Great smelling and keeps my hair smooth and shiny.  Also keeps the static down in the dry winter air.  Never makes my hair look greasy</li>
    <li> i used this on my hair and it made my face and shoulders break out.  i had never had a pimple on my shoulder before.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it leaves my hair soft and shiny. It really helps with the split ends too. This bottle will last forever as you don&#x27;t need much for the ends of your hair. If you use too much, it will end up greasy looking. Also, do not use on your roots or else you will realIy look like you didn&#x27;t wash your hair. I don&#x27;t care for the oily feel on my hands after, but if it makes my hair look gorgeous, I don&#x27;t care.</li>
    <li> What an excellent product! I have extra long and thick indigenous hair. It can sometimes take two days for my hair to air dry completely. I massaged a little of this product in towel dry hair and I was honestly shocked when my hair had air dried very smooth about three hours later. I didn&#x27;t realize that &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t mean a &amp;#34;lighter weight&amp;#34; formula, it only applies to the coloring. Apparently when people who used color treatments were using the regular formula, they found it occasionally &amp;#34;muddied&amp;#34; their hair color. I do not use hair color and my hair is naturally dark black, but I would use this formula again. I will repurchase the regular formula to compare and contrast, though I can&#x27;t imagine much change in them. Shipped super amazingly fast! Excellent smell and texture to my hair!</li>
    <li> The best thing for shine and keeping frizz away.  My hairdresser introduced me to this product.  I use it every day whether I am wearing my hair naturally curly or straightening it.  Never makes your hair look greasy.  Note:  I use the LIGHT formula.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair feel so smooth after I use it. I have used other moroccan oils before but this is abs. the best one out on the market. Yes it is a bit pricey compared to what you can get out there today. However if you want to have smooth smooth hair get this product.</li>
    <li> I love this hair line ileum morocanoil because it leaves your hair silky and with an incredible shine. recommend!!! Appreciate</li>
    <li> Recommended by my stylist.  No regrets  Much cheaper through Amazon than in stores, about half as much in price.</li>
    <li> I tend to get &amp;#34;flathead&amp;#34; fi I use products that are too heavy, but much to my surprise, its perfect on my ends and smells delicious and also rub it on my hands after applying to my hair. The light is definitely light and can be applied on wet and dry hair</li>
    <li> loved it. bought bigger bottle later</li>
    <li> Purchased this with mask and shampoo and conditioner. THis stuff works magic on my blonde hair that i curl everyday!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product for hair, a little bit small bottle but my sister was happy. Later She will order again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have naturally curly hair.  Moroccan oil is the only product that  leaves my hair shiny, manageable and frizz free.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! It never weighs down my fine hair or makes it looks greasy. Makes it soft and still holds a style well. I will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I have dry hair but I love the light one better than the regular one because it&#x27;s not too oily.  Great for shine.</li>
    <li> I love the Moroccan line.</li>
    <li> I bought this because ilikeweylie &#x27;s channel on youtube always raving about it, but it didnt do much for my hair. But this was the first of about 10 things i ordered to show up to my house, and in great condition and it does smell very good.</li>
    <li> Works great with fine hair. Some oils are heavy and weigh my hair down, but if you use this one sparingly it is perfect!</li>
    <li> I have medium length blonde hair &amp; always worry about putting anything in my hair that makes it oily or weighed down. I love this stuff! It smells so good &amp; it really does make my hair look shiny &amp; healthy. A little goes a LONG way so this size was perfect for me &amp; will last at least 6 months with daily usage.</li>
    <li> having naturally wavy, vfine hair and living in a very dry climate. this has taken the frizz out of my hair</li>
    <li> Great stuff, not to heaven. Kills the frizz!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing it everyday for years, it really makes a difference in the strength of the hair. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the Moroccan oil but the light was just too light for me. I believe  my hair  needs an oil that is a tad bit heavier than the light oil. I plan on going back to the regular product.</li>
    <li> Smell good and works not bad but just so so</li>
    <li> I love it, It&#x27;s great for hair. Iove to use it for my skin. has a really nice smell.</li>
    <li> Loved it. Makes my hair so smooth!</li>
    <li> I love this product-- my hair is fine and most conditioners or hair treatments are too heavy and make it greasy. I use this product every other day, though, and it keeps my hair smooth, soft, and non-greasy. I&#x27;ve been using my last bottle for almost a year. I have shoulder-length hair and just a small amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Good for my troubled hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with the results that just a drop provide. I&#x27;ve used it twice in the past week, and it has made my hair feel very soft yet thick. It smells nice too! I&#x27;d definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome, I totally recommend it! In my opinion, if you have this product you don&#x27;t need to buy the hair mask.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  You really only need a small drop in your hair and it goes a long way!  It really calms down the frizzy areas I have in some of my lower layers of my hair. And it smells fantastic as well!  I would say it smells very close to a sweet vanilla... So in the end my hair is smooth, healthy and smells yummy! I am very happy with this oil. :)</li>
    <li> I love Moroccanoil! I have been using it for years. My hair is much healthier since I have been using this product as recommended by my hair dresser. And it smells really good!</li>
    <li> It feels heavy on my hair - even though this is the light version.  I have a different oil that I like much more.</li>
    <li> For my wife, SHE LOVE WHAT IT DOES TO HER HAIR, it does GREAT, she even has me using IT!</li>
