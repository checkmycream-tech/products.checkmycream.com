      <li>I am sure that its been tampered.</li>

      <li>glad to see it&#x27;s still around</li>
      <li>It is a favorite fragrance of his.</li>
      <li>Glad you all are keeping Tuscany on hand.</li>
      <li>Many do not like strong colognes on</li>
      <li>, the original is more Yellowish and has more of a Stronger scent to it</li>
      <li>No ther cologne has this distinct kind of smell.</li>
      <li>This great scent is the same I&#x27;ve loved since it first appeared in the 80&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I knew that when I was making the purchase, so it was no surprise, but I think the original scent is much better.</li>
      <li>Tuscany is as amazing as it was when it was first introduced</li>
      <li>The price increased tremendously when it was discontinued in the malls, which doesn&#x27;t make sense being now in an outlet!</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s important 😄</li>
      <li>But yes, it&#x27;s still the same great Tuscany that&#x27;s always been in my fragrance rotation.</li>
      <li>Cheers Amazon, for having it available.</li>
      <li>Have worn since mid 80&#x27;s-and  the original is great</li>
      <li>It has change over the years-its no longer as musky as it originally was-</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so fresh!</li>
      <li>This is not the original Tuscany cologne, but it&#x27;s close.</li>
      <li>Note the original does not say spray vaporisateur on the bottle-nor does it have greenish color.</li>
      <li>Clean...</li>
      <li>By far the hubby&#x27;s favorite (mine too)!</li>
      <li>Just didn&#x27;t smell the same as I remember, not as good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad for the price though.</li>
      <li>It has such a unique smell that&#x27;s not overpowering, but just the right ammount of good.</li>
      <li>It elicits the same response of joy and calm today as it did the first time I smelled it.</li>
      <li>My wife, who is Italian and Sicilian, turned me on to Tuscany a few years ago, and I immediately fell in love with its wonderful odor</li>
      <li>But me wearing it has also turned on other women, who have wanted to know what cologne I was wearing, so they could go out and buy some for their own husbands!</li>
      <li>The only issue is longevity could be better!</li>
      <li>can only hope the men rediscover this amazing scent.</li>
      <li>... the bottle looks real but this stuff is a cheap knockoff.</li>
      <li>Arrived super fast!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ihave always used Tuscany since 1984.  Glad you all are keeping Tuscany on hand.</li>
    <li> I bought this on Amazon and for half off what I would pay at Dillard&#x27;s! I buy this cologne for my step dad every year and he loves it!</li>
    <li> Masculine cologne. Aramis should reissue this product. Not commonly used. Wife loves it.</li>
    <li> delivery was mucher longer than set forth.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is the same product that i have used for years.</li>
    <li> Thank goodness Aramis brought this fragrance back. Thank goodness again that they did not reformulate it to satisfy &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; tastes in perfume. Tuscany is somewhat old school, but done in a rich and sophisticated fashion and without the bombastic elements that caused people to turn away from powerhouses, like its older brother Aramis. Tuscany begins with a refreshing lemon note, common to masculine fragrances of this time, but here done with subtlety, so that the note whispers rather than screams. As it dries down, it offers a mix of aromatic herbs and flowers, a light musky/dirty quality, and a terrific leather note. Dirty notes have largely disappeared from designer male fragrances, and that&#x27;s a very sad thing. This quality elevates the fragrance and really aids in capturing the vision of the Italian countryside that inspired the perfume. It also offers a passionate quality that will be appreciated when in &amp;#34;close quarters.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who like things like CK One and Eternity, this offers a big step up in subtlety and complexity without really leaving behind the refreshing citrus and delightful woods and aromatics of these. So, the next time you&#x27;re considering buying yet another bottle of Acqua de Gio, CK One, Eternity, and so on, why not branch out and give Tuscany a try? You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> The smell of the Tuscany is missing.  I do know that Tuscany had been terminated and I thought this was the same as the old, but this is a poor substitute.  It is a waist of money.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Not the same as what I used to get before.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not quite how I remembered it, but it&#x27;s a nice scent.  Just don&#x27;t use too much or you&#x27;ll be one of those people.</li>
    <li> I have used this product since 1976,and I intend to use it for all time.1ST I like the scent,Its clean.refreshing and pleasant.I will also say I heard from women of all walks of life.They all say its a breath of fresh air and tends to have a very natural fragrance that if my husband or man friend wore that He would not leave the house.They sometimes  ask if they could get alittle closer.But that isn&#x27;t why its number 1 with me,its because I do love everything about it.I have tried many,the run of the mill and some very special types,but it just can&#x27;t get near Tuscany Spray .Thank you for asking.It compliments itself.Barry</li>
    <li> By far the hubby&#x27;s favorite (mine too)!</li>
    <li> This is literally the only fragrance in the world my stepfather will put on so I got it for a Christmas gift.  I can&#x27;t rate the product itself but I do appreciate the fast delivery especially since it was free.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 was because I felt the price could&#x27;ve been a tad lower.</li>
    <li> It is one of the cleanest smelling colognes. I also like that it holds it&#x27;s fragrance all day when I wear it.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne.  Smells great!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Tuscany since 1988 when it was introduced. I was working at Macys at the time. I have always been complimented on this scent. It has change over the years-its no longer as musky as it originally was- but it still on my shelf.</li>
    <li> I will be buying some more of the Tuscany as well as other items. Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> Arrived super fast! Only thing. Not a problem but I have been using this cologne for a long time and never has the color of it been green! It smells the same.</li>
    <li> My very favorite men&#x27;s cologne!  It may be a vintage scent, but it&#x27;s still awesome!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my friend for Valentine&#x27;s Day! He opened it and said it didn&#x27;t smell like it did a few years ago.  It has a different scent he did not like it.  I have sent it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theresa</li>
    <li> It was what I was looking for and at a very reasonable price. I have used this product at least 8 to 10 years.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance and lasts all day! I recommend this cologne over all others colognes on the maker today. It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> The scent is amazing!</li>
    <li> I have used this cologne for many years always get good remarks about this product</li>
    <li> Used the cologne for years. I like the toilet water better.</li>
    <li> Fake. been wearing this for years, bottle  markings are wrong, cologne itself is the wrong color. Scent is weak and short lived.</li>
    <li> Been loving it for 25 years</li>
    <li> Our local retailers stop handling this and going to the big city was to inconvenient. Amazon was the perfect solution and the price was better..</li>
    <li> This is not the original Tuscany cologne, but it&#x27;s close. The color is green rather than a scotch color. For the price, it&#x27;s a great deal. The ladies like it and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s important 😄</li>
    <li> Maybe fragrances lose their strength and scent over time, but this did not seem to be the original Tuscany scent and had very little potency.</li>
    <li> My Dad loves this cologne. Unfortunately, it seems to be getting harder to find in our area. I was very happy to find it here on Amazon at a great price. Brand new in box just as described.</li>
    <li> The Tuscany I ordered is the same I could have purchased in a store, only less expensive.  Buy some for yourself.</li>
    <li> My husband really loves Tuscany by Aramis. It is often difficult to find in a store, and the one store that I am able to find it at is very pricey. My purchase online looks and smells like the one that I bought from a major retail store.&lt;br /&gt;I forgot to order early, and I had to pay for shipping, but well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;JR</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a one fragrance type of guy... works for me..</li>
    <li> I started using this new bottle today and it does not smell like the same Tuscany. I finished the former bottle earlier this week so it is not the case that I &amp;#34;forgot&amp;#34;or don&#x27;t know what the cologne should smell like. I will give it a day to make sure it is not something with my smell today but otherwise will hope I can get a replacement or refund.</li>
    <li> Product is a fake, not close to the original.  Different color and way different smell.  I wont even use it.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Hardly noticeable after the 1st hour or two, not as strong and long lasting typical of original branded perfumes, probably fake.</li>
    <li> I have used the Tuscany by Aramis product for many years and found that it is ideal for my requirements</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this cologne for 15 years. And THIS is NOT Tuscany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh... the bottle looks real but this stuff is a cheap knockoff. If I sound pissed... it&#x27;s because I just spend $50 on a FAKE that I cannot return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come on Amazon... really?</li>
    <li> Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This is my hub&#x27;s favorite fragrance for probably at least thirty years and has become very hard to find! He get&#x27;s many compliments even from younger ladies so he&#x27;ll wear it as long as it is available. Thank you, Amazon!</li>
    <li> This has a wonderful smell that isn&#x27;t too strong yet it lasts most of the day. I get a lot of compliments on it and have worn it for years without getting tired of the smell. As a plus, I&#x27;m a bit chemically-sensitive and it&#x27;s one of the few that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> Tuscany is what my wife demands I use as my cologne.  I like it too, but more important other people like it as well.</li>
    <li> I was a bit apprehensive with the mixed reviews on this &amp;#34;newly packaged&amp;#34; item. Fortunate (so far) not to have experienced what was mentioned (i.e. sedimentation, precipitation, change in scent) in some of the negative reviews. A good item for those who have grown to love this &amp;#34;hard-to-find&amp;#34; item. Cheers Amazon, for having it available.</li>
    <li> This Product was made in UK.&lt;br /&gt;The package was intact and the bottle was sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the scent was twice weaker than Tuscany Per Uomo I bought in the DisneyWorld&#x27;s brittish shop&lt;br /&gt;and in Dillard, in Orlando, FL, 2000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I still can accept this Tuscany for the price $25.00 including tax, shipment and handling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next one I would buy again offline only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 05/30/2015:&lt;br /&gt;Finishing it: no scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;Changed from 4 stars to 2.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance!!!!!</li>
    <li> This great scent is the same I&#x27;ve loved since it first appeared in the 80&#x27;s. It&#x27;s still a long-lasting, high quality fragrance and its packaging has been updated. The bottle itself now has an affixed logo/branding in the middle, rather than the traditional \\&quot;Tuscany per Uomo\\&quot; written on the lower half of said glass bottle. But yes, it&#x27;s still the same great Tuscany that&#x27;s always been in my fragrance rotation.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice, inexpensive cologne.  I was surprised that the liquid is green instead yellow like the photo but no big deal.</li>
    <li> Great product shipped timely and safely</li>
    <li> The shipping of this item was twice as fast as I expected (3 days), but like others who have commented, the formula has changed. I knew that when I was making the purchase, so it was no surprise, but I think the original scent is much better. I like the scent still, and I would probably rate over all at 31/2 stars.</li>
    <li> Tuscany is as amazing as it was when it was first introduced the smell is so fresh and clean so much to where a good nose will instantly be able to tell that its an expensive cologne of quality and richness. No ther cologne has this distinct kind of smell. It arrived faster than I thought it was but leave it up to Amazon to do their best to keep a market of satisfied customers. I Applaud them for that. But men if youve never smelled this cologne youll come back again and again and oh yes again. I can best describe it as..Clean...Fresh..Quality..Distinctive..Masculine and Manly. So dont be surprised if someone says..&amp;#34;man what is that your wearing&amp;#34;..but dont tell lets keep this old school favorite our little secret..LOL</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It has such a unique smell that&#x27;s not overpowering, but just the right ammount of good. My girlfriend loves it. Really good deal too.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE  GOT IT IM NO TIME.... I WISH THEY MADE A BIGGER SIZE.. BUT THIS IS ONE FOR MY COLLECTION I JUST GOT A BIG BOTTLE OF CALVIN... I CANT BELIEVE I FOUND IT ... KIND OF EXSPENSIVE BUT YOU CANNOT FIND IT ANYWHERE ANYMORE SO I THOUGFHT I BETTER SNATCH IT UP BEFORE THEY RUN OUT IN FACT I MAY GET ANOTHER BOTTLE IF I FEEL CRAZY....</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this company and recived my order very quickly, will shop with them again. There prices were the best!</li>
    <li> Understated and enjoyable. I don&#x27;t want to stink up a scene.  But this is just the right fragrance.  Good choice</li>
    <li> Have worn since mid 80&#x27;s-and  the original is great-this is not the same-You can still buy online at Macy&#x27;s. Note the original does not say spray vaporisateur on the bottle-nor does it have greenish color. Its too bad they say its the real deal-but it is just not. Not bad-just not what folks think they are getting.</li>
    <li> Just like everyone says...it&#x27;s a different recipe that doesn&#x27;t last. Aramis or whoever produces it now needs to bring back the original formula. It&#x27;s not bad for the price though.</li>
    <li> my favorite cologne at a good price</li>
    <li> With this bottle sitting next to my other bottles of Tuscany Per Uomo, it is very clearly a different product.  The cologne in the other bottles is of a definite amber color, whereas this bottle has a distinctive green tint to it.  The smell is different as well.  Some of the scent is similar, but it lacks some of the herbal smell like cinnamon.  It actually has a little bit stronger smell than the normal Tuscany cologne.  Although the bottle has a label that says it is Tuscany Per Uomo by Aramis, the label looks different than my other bottles, and the bottle label does not show the address information for Aramis.  All my other Aramis bottles of this scent say Aramis Inc., Dist N.Y., N.Y.  10022.  The box does have the address information and adds \\&quot;MADE IN U.K. 2MA5.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used this enough to hear comments from others about it.  The stronger smell may not be a good thing, because usually the kind of comment I get about the normal Tuscany is how subtle the smell is.  Many do not like strong colognes on men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this cologne is probably a fake, but I&#x27;m not going to bother with trying to return it.  It does smell good so I am going to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**[UPDATE]**&lt;br /&gt;Having used this cologne for over four months now, I can say that it is definitely not the real McCoy. Therefore, I am reducing the stars to 1.  Normally Aramis Tuscany gives me compliments and people ask me what the scent is that I am wearing. Nobody ever compliments me or asks when I wear this one. I still have most of the bottle left, but I&#x27;m buying something else because this one does not have the scent that I like.</li>
    <li> This is not the same scent I grew up with ..I was happy to find that I couldget it here the bottle labeling and color were both different I was used to seeing that darker yellowish gold color and the scent just not right..but its still a good scent..</li>
    <li> I want to start by addressing my appreciation on how Amazon dealt with this issue. 5 stars for Amazon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Tuscany for years now and I know how it smells. This product is not the Tuscany. the packaging and container are Tuscany but it far from smelling like Tuscany. I am sure that its been tampered. I won&#x27;t spend $1 for such a fake product. Disappointed to find such a fake product sold by Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;I have seen people rating this product as 5 stars. So I am not sure if they don&#x27;t know how Tuscany smells or if they got it from a different seller in Amazon, but I assure you this is not Tuscany.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should allow customers to rate products with (-1) star where they are fake, tampered, or not original!</li>
    <li> My Husband loved the smell, it arrived in good time for his Birthday. The price was very good compared to the High Street shops.</li>
    <li> great smell--came in 3 days --GREAT</li>
    <li> I like it. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the Natural Spray, the original is more Yellowish and has more of a Stronger scent to it but... I would still purchase it.... especially the price.&lt;br /&gt;I had a bad accident in 2002 and I Can&#x27;t Smell Anything so..... with my 5 Daughters and Wife... they are the ones who tells me about the scent and how strong it is or long lasting it is.</li>
    <li> Favorite cologne, can no longer find sold in retail outlets.  Bought product at normal retail price.  Shipped in reasonable amount of time.  Smelled like I remember.  No evidence of counterfeit or bootleg.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this cologne and the price can&#x27;t be beat for the ounces you get.</li>
    <li> My wife, who is Italian and Sicilian, turned me on to Tuscany a few years ago, and I immediately fell in love with its wonderful odor and I never wanted to use any other cologne or after-shave again.  Besides, it turns her on to ME!  But me wearing it has also turned on other women, who have wanted to know what cologne I was wearing, so they could go out and buy some for their own husbands!</li>
    <li> Had a hard time finding this locally, have work it for 20+ years and the ladies love it.  You will not be dispappointed !</li>
    <li> I have to be honest I knew Aramis to have quality products and I chose this one because of the name!!j</li>
    <li> Great product and a great price.</li>
    <li> This cologne is old school and has a clean,fresh,light fragrance. It is not overpowering and will last throughout the day. It is getting more and more difficult to find it in stores,as it has been around for several years. A good choice for any manly man!</li>
    <li> Been wearing Tuscany for over 20 years now.  Love the scent</li>
    <li> Smells very nice and not over powering!</li>
    <li> My husband had use this cologne for over 15 years. He loves it as much as I do. He smells wonderful and he gets tones of complements.</li>
    <li> Still my husband&#x27;s favorite after shave.  Have never been able to find anything he likes as well.  He gets many compliments on it.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite!  It&#x27;s expensive but goes a long way.  An annual Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> Purchased from BeautyEncounter. Nice, sealed packaging. But there is sediment at the bottom of the bottle (see pics) when the cologne settles, and disappears when shaken. I might report this to the FDA.&lt;br /&gt;I have owned multiple bottles of Aramis Tuscany over the years, and none have had this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased (again) in 9/2014.&lt;br /&gt;This time I see a bristle (or fiber) floating inside the otherwise clear liquid.&lt;br /&gt;How do these things get into a sealed bottle of cologne?</li>
    <li> This item was purchased as a gift for Christmas, I rated it 5 stars because of the price. It appears to be legit but will not know until it is opened on Christmas day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years...  I always get the &amp;#34;oh my god, you smell good&amp;#34; from the ladies - so I&#x27;m not planning on changing colognes anytime soon...  Also, I like not smelling like every other guy at the bar or office...  Great price, good scent...</li>
    <li> I Have Been Using This Product For 15 Years Its The Best In Fragrance And Lasting Power And&lt;br /&gt;I Get Complements</li>
    <li> I wear nothing else!  Except clothing...of course :-)</li>
    <li> Been using this for quite awhile.. glad to see it&#x27;s still around</li>
    <li> Love this product, have used it for years. Bought other items not very happy. The dog products are great as well.</li>
    <li> Always get compliments when I wear this old standard.</li>
    <li> It was an easy way to find a difficult product. Just didn&#x27;t smell the same as I remember, not as good.</li>
    <li> When my guy wears this, it drives me completely nuts. Imagine my shock to hear that for a while they actually stopped making it. I ordered another bottle for his birthday, and wanted to get him every type of Tuscany that they made. I was SOOO disappointed to discover the make but one choice of Tuscany for Men at this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only hope the men rediscover this amazing scent. And that Aramis realizes how great it would be for us to be able to buy the full panoply of products for our guys. But then again, we might not get much done....smiling.</li>
    <li> Very dissapointing.Like tuscany when you spray it but the fragrance disappears the next moment.&lt;br /&gt;Dont know what this is but defnitly no quality.</li>
    <li> Just doesn&#x27;t smell quite like my uncles I must try other Aramis&#x27;</li>
    <li> Weird.  It just doesn&#x27;t smell like it is supposed to...</li>
    <li> I love Tuscany this is the best</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK, but not exceptional and not as fragrant as I remember from years past. I try not overpower with my applications, and have had only one favorable comment so far</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tuscany cologne and after shave for so many years and this product i just recently bought did not smell the same. I&#x27;m so disappointed and would like to return the product. It smells like imitation Tuscany. So sorry for this negative review.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my sons birthday.  It is a favorite fragrance of his. He particularly likes its fresh and manly scent.  It is very hard to find,  I was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> When this first came out in 84, I remember getting a decant sample of this in Montreal when I was a kid- I&#x27;ve been in love with it since then! Nothing else matches my body chemistry as well as this! I&#x27;ve gone through many types of cologne and always come back to this one! It elicits the same response of joy and calm today as it did the first time I smelled it. It&#x27;s so fresh! The top notes are heavy citrus, mid notes leathery and bottom notes/ draw down, woody and powdery. The only issue is longevity could be better! I&#x27;m still trying to find a fixative to extend this a few more hrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new bottle does have subtle difference in smell. (Plus the bottle and packaging look and feel cheaper now- for shame Aramis for shame!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a side by side comparison of the old and new. Upon first spray, the new formula smelled substantially &amp;#34;heavier&amp;#34; the cinnamon came through much stronger than the old formula. I was initially very disappointed and put the bottle away for a week and started searching eBay buys for the old formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly after a week- the new formula improved dramatically- not sure if just a touch of air got in with the few sprays enough to mellow things out a bit? But the new smelled significantly closer to old. Now my old bottle is pushing 5yrs old now and scents do change a bit with time and mature/mellow out which the old mix is definitely exactly that. I&#x27;m wondering what the new bottle will smell like in 5yrs? Hopefully the same effect will happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way- I&#x27;m now satisfied enough with the authenticity of the new formula to buy it instead of forking out substantially more cash to get the old formula on eBay (getting expensive and hard to find) - I will continue to buy this product so long as they keep making it!</li>
    <li> this cologn was  given to me as a christmas present approximately 24-30 years ago and I loved it. have been using it ever since,  I am constantly getting praise for it in public and all want to know what it is. a lot of dept stores quit handling it, I do not know why.</li>
    <li> My father loves this smell, I really like it too, great for men and he definatley would purchase again!</li>
    <li> Have used Tuscany by Aramis for many years.  One of my favorites.</li>
    <li> My husbands favorite cologne, and not easy to find. Usually three times the cost. What a great deal from Amazon, and fast shipping as well. Thank you! I will definitely be back soon!!</li>
    <li> My hubby has used this for 26 yrs. he always smells inviting!  The price increased tremendously when it was discontinued in the malls, which doesn&#x27;t make sense being now in an outlet!</li>
    <li> I have worn tuscany for years this does not smell like it.</li>
    <li> Tuscany has changed its formula. This is not the same Tuscany from the mid-1980&#x27;s. The bottle design is different, the fragrance is different, and it has a funny green tinge to it, instead of the classy gold color. If you&#x27;re looking to buy the old classic, this is not it. The picture is misleading as the actual bottle has more of a greenish tinge to it than what is shown. Just a heads up for everyone!</li>
