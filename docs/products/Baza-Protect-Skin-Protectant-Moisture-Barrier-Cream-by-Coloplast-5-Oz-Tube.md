    <li> Works really well for those body folds that can get irritted.  It will prevent the irritation or clear it up if already irritated.</li>
    <li> Protects delicate skin from urine and constant diarrhea like nothing else out there. This was recommended to us by two doctors when faced with a terminal disease &amp; unpleasant treatment side effects for an elderly parent. The one problem we didn&#x27;t have was skin break down!</li>
    <li> I happen to be allergic to fragrance so this does not work for me.  If you aren&#x27;t allergic to fragrance then it is a good product.</li>
    <li> This is the first time we have ued this product and found that it truly speeds up the healing process.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my dad who was in a nursing home.  This was the same cream which was previously used at the hospital for him.  It worked very well.</li>
    <li> The image was deceiving. When I ordered, the picture was of the old bottle design. I thought I was ordering an Anti-fungal Baza cream. I decided to keep this bottle, but also placed a new order for the anti-fungal cream.</li>
    <li> exactly what I expected. very useful product. Arrived quickly</li>
    <li> does great to prevent diaper rash</li>
    <li> I bought this cream to use on my elderly mother.  It protected her from getting rashes.  If you are a caretaker of an elderly person, or even a younger person, I recommend this product for protection of their skin.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product</li>
    <li> This and the antifungal moisture barrier cream are essential to all medicine cabinents. Great for skin on skin rashes. My sister is a wound care nurse and can not speak highly enough on how these Baza moisture barrier creams can help protect against skin breakdown.</li>
    <li> This is one protect skin that work like say it.</li>
    <li> The cream is very good and seems to do the trick, I would buy it again and pass on the item name to others.</li>
    <li> Have not found anything better.  Creamy and washes off when you want it too but doesn&#x27;t just rub off.  Not thick and caky like some products.</li>
    <li> My mom had been very sick, she developed grade 3 bed sores that were very painful.  A nurse told me about this cream, we tried it and it worked miricles, my mom&#x27;s visiting nurse got some and tried it on a patient with  grade 4 bed sores for two years it worked on him as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a miricle, my mom is now pain free, and the sores healed beautifully&lt;br /&gt;I reccomend it highly</li>
    <li> Best stuff you can get</li>
    <li> This is an excellent ointment to protect skin from moisture, thick but not sticky.</li>
    <li> I know that this product is advertised for diaper rash, but I used it on my mother&#x27;s besore which healed in a couple of weeks.  Wonderful product.  I use a little big on the bedsore and cover it with a telfa pad and paper tape.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. Use for diaper rash cream and love it.</li>
    <li> Used by caregivers for elderly.  It seems to work well to keep skin healthy.  Caregivers for mother-in-law&lt;br /&gt;have used it for abouttwo years.</li>
    <li> This was for my husband&#x27;s skin condition on his hands.  His hands will itch like crazy and get cracked and even have infected sores.  All the regular anti-itch and moisturizing hand creams he&#x27;s tried burn and don&#x27;t work that well.  This stuff helps quell the itching and keeps his hands moisturized.  Then his skin has a chance at healing.</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s pediatrician recommended this when he had a bad diaper rash that wasn&#x27;t healing and the regular diaper ointment we use wasn&#x27;t helping. It worked wonders keeping the rash itself protected, and stopped it from worsening. When he gets a really bad rash we use 3M Cavilon spray on top of the Coloplast to give it a bit of added moisture seal. He hasn&#x27;t had a rash that severe since, and now at the first sign of a diaper rash I&#x27;ll start using coloplast on the affected area, and the redness goes away in less than 24 hours.</li>
    <li> Baza Protect Skin Protectant Moisure Barrier Cream is a fantastic product as long as it is used properly.  I seen CNA&#x27;s in rehabs and nursing homes just slap more of the cream over the old cream without cleaning a person.  Luckily, I can control that issue since my Mom is at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If used correctly, people using the cream along with a new brief, should never have a breakdown of skin.</li>
    <li> Item used by professional nurse. The moisture barrier cream is used daily including at night.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product unequivocally/without reservation.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom who just came home from the hospital and then rehab.  Her doctor&#x27;s nurse had recommended it a few months back and she&#x27;d been buying it at the 3-letter drugstore chain.  She was very surprised at the price of this compared to what she&#x27;d been paying.  According to her it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Very helpful in treating my anal tender skin problem.&lt;br /&gt;Only problem, I had to cut the tube in half to be able to use the last of the cream.</li>
    <li> Works well.  My doctor recommended it and very glad he did.  A bit messy to apply but ultimate results is solid protection and relief.</li>
    <li> It is very good for what I used it for.  I do recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years on my patient, and it works great. Keeps skin soft and free of irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is the price. It&#x27;s very expensive, but a little goes a long way.</li>
