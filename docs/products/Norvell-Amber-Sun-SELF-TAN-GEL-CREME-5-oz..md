      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>It has a very nice, light almond scent and doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothing.  </li>
      <li>If applied correctly, it shows beautiful golden tan with no orange streaks.  </li>
      <li>And, I have tried many.</li>
      <li>I. Love.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love this product because smells somewhat</li>
      <li>I love the color you get from it, but I thought I was getting the cream not the bronze colored cream.</li>
      <li>I have had no streaking whatsoever from this product. &#x3D;]</li>
      <li>Plus, I showered before the three applications so three layers and no funky playdough or starchy odor most lotions that contain DHA have.&lt;br</li>
      <li>make sure you loofa well before use ...</li>
      <li>This is the best self tanner I&#x27;ve used - instant color.</li>
      <li>It gives you the most authentic looking tan I have ever seen.</li>
      <li>it helps make sure you spread it evenly, and it&#x27;s good for those who want fast results.</li>
      <li>It goes on easy with a bit of tint</li>
      <li>I have tried over six different types and brands of self-tanners and this is the first one I have been fully happy with.</li>
      <li>Streaks the least and had the best color and eveness.</li>
      <li>The initial fragrance is pleasant and when you wake up the next day your legs are nicely tan with no traces of orange.</li>
      <li>Obviously not as good as the Norvell spray tan but is one of the best sunless  gel/lotions I&#x27;ve used yet!</li>
      <li>is more worry free and produces the same off the beach color.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t think that the item was fresh</li>
      <li>and she was so right.  </li>
      <li>A little goes a long way...and, best of all??</li>
      <li>I used to be able to get this self tanning creme at a local tanning salon.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not saying I may never use the mousse again, but as long as the crème is available I will continue to use it!  </li>
      <li>This is the first self-tanner that really does what I want.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend the Norvell Amber Sun products!</li>
      <li>This is such a fantastic product.</li>
      <li>I am VERY pale naturally and this does not turn you orange, its a really nice glow, and I&#x27;ve applied it three time in 24 hours over the mystic</li>
      <li>I use a small floor fan to dry my legs but without the fan it does dry pretty quickly on its own.</li>
      <li>My skin feels very soft vs. when I use the mousse.  </li>
      <li>All I can say is WOW!</li>
      <li>I do highly recommend if you use your bare hands ( which I do)  to wash your hands well after each application.  </li>
      <li>so you can really decide how much and how dark you want to get.</li>
      <li>No strange after-odors on the skin, no splotchiness, and</li>

    <li> Excellent product, Excellent Service. Thank you. This is such a fantastic product. Best sunless tanning product I have ever used. And, I have tried many.</li>
    <li> Best smelling self tanner we have ever used.Color could be darker but it works.Color lasts for about 4 days.We will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Obviously not as good as the Norvell spray tan but is one of the best sunless  gel/lotions I&#x27;ve used yet!</li>
    <li> This is the best self-tanning product I have ever used. A little goes a long way...and, best of all?? It doesn&#x27;t have that icky self-tanner smell after it&#x27;s been sitting on my skin for a few hours. I love it!!</li>
    <li> Love it!  No orange. No splotches. Beautiful results.</li>
    <li> Absolutely  a great color!  So happy I found it.</li>
    <li> This creme is moisturizing and gives an instant bronze.  It has a very nice, light almond scent and doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothing.  There is no streaking, and it doesn&#x27;t turn you orange.  I love this product and will continue purchasing it!</li>
    <li> I love the color you get from it, but I thought I was getting the cream not the bronze colored cream. I prefer no instant bronzing.</li>
    <li> I have olive skin tone and could tell I was using anything. There was no color difference what so ever. I would not recommend this product for olive skin tone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products on the market, not just ones sold at the drugstore but at tanning salons.  I think this works the best.  Streaks the least and had the best color and eveness.</li>
    <li> All I can say is WOW! This is the first self-tanner that really does what I want. It doesn&#x27;t turn your skin into strange colors like orange and yellow. I have tried over six different types and brands of self-tanners and this is the first one I have been fully happy with. No strange after-odors on the skin, no splotchiness, and best of all the color is a nice natural-looking tan!</li>
    <li> I used to be able to get this self tanning creme at a local tanning salon. I now have to buy it on Amazon and am so thankful to have found it. This is the best self tanning product I have ever used. It gives you the most authentic looking tan I have ever seen. It goes on easy with a bit of tint so you can see any missed spots. I use a small floor fan to dry my legs but without the fan it does dry pretty quickly on its own. The initial fragrance is pleasant and when you wake up the next day your legs are nicely tan with no traces of orange. I do highly recommend if you use your bare hands ( which I do)  to wash your hands well after each application.  My tanned legs usually last 5 days ...make sure you loofa well before use ...this helps your skin to be well prepped for application.</li>
    <li> Subtle and works well if you follow the directions.</li>
    <li> This self tan cream is the best I have ever used, and I thought I had used them all.  A friend recommended this and she was so right.  If applied correctly, it shows beautiful golden tan with no orange streaks.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I was a big fan of the Amber Sun mousse until I tried the crème!!  To me the crème!  is more worry free and produces the same off the beach color.  It has a smell you can tolerate.  My skin feels very soft vs. when I use the mousse.  I&#x27;m not saying I may never use the mousse again, but as long as the crème is available I will continue to use it!  I highly recommend the Norvell Amber Sun products!</li>
    <li> The color was off from others I compared to from tanning salon. Don&#x27;t think that the item was fresh</li>
    <li> Brown glue look when applies. Will try to return</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love this product because smells somewhat and if you don&#x27;t scrub it off after a few days it will be splotchy. I do like the color it gives NO orange tint.</li>
    <li> This is the best self tanner I&#x27;ve used - instant color. This will now be my go to self tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> I. Love. This. Product. The DHA has very little odor. (previously, I said \\&quot;NO odor\\&quot; and I have noticed one now.) it spreads onto the skin well so you can really decide how much and how dark you want to get. I like the bronzers bc it helps make sure you spread it evenly, and it&#x27;s good for those who want fast results. I have had no streaking whatsoever from this product. &#x3D;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it in between Mystic tans to prolong its life,darken my color, and even to correct any lines or blotches I might have gotten from the booth the day before. Its also great for touching up your hands but haven&#x27;t tried it on my face. (I&#x27;m slightly nervous the bronzers might break me out &#x3D;/) I am VERY pale naturally and this does not turn you orange, its a really nice glow, and I&#x27;ve applied it three time in 24 hours over the mystic I just got 24 hours previous and Ive achieved what used to take me three months of baking outside or in a bed. Plus, I showered before the three applications so three layers and no funky playdough or starchy odor most lotions that contain DHA have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End decision- 9/10 and only bc I wish it was a little darker but that&#x27;s nothing another application wont fix.</li>
