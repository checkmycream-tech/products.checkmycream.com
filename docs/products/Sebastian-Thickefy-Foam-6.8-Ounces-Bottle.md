      <li>This product is fantastic!!!</li>
      <li>LOVE this stuff!!  </li>
      <li>Good product and good price.  </li>
      <li>I think the price is fair and the product does what it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
      <li>and I was hoping that this was a good substitute.  </li>
      <li>Sebastian used to make a product years ago that I loved, then they discontinued it.  </li>
      <li>However, used alone after shampooing and conditioning with Sebastian Volupt, I am very pleased with Thickefy (although my brain keeps seeing the name as Thickety...</li>
      <li>I did love the smell!  </li>

      <li>which I kinda like better than Thickefy!)</li>
      <li>does a good job and it is very light on the hair</li>
      <li>I really liked the Sabastian hairspray.</li>

      <li>I love this product.  </li>

      <li>so I make sure I test the product for a week</li>
      <li>Basically does what it claims to do, although it&#x27;s more about making your hair more manageable and shapely without stickiness or crunchiness.</li>
      <li>It should be more &amp;#34;foamy&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Have been using this product for some time and have not found anything that works better.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>

      <li>and if it&#x27;s causing more harm or doing nothing to my hair</li>

      <li>I mainly put it on the roots which is working GREAT for me.</li>
      <li>I have found it best to use with damp hair and then blow dry.</li>
      <li>I was glad to see it available.</li>
      <li>I love that Sebastian thickefy foam is so light and airy when you pump it out.</li>
      <li>This product makes me feel like I have a full head of hair!</li>
      <li>This product is easy to use.</li>
      <li>it is the first product of its kind</li>
      <li>It give body and life to fine hair.  </li>
      <li>and you have fine hair</li>
      <li>I would recommend to anyone with fine hair.  </li>
      <li>It is a light mousse foam that is easy to apply.</li>
      <li>(I have fine, shoulder length hair).  </li>
      <li>It is a God send for people with fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Thought I would try something new, I liked it but know better.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of the Sebastian Shaper Hair spray; having used it now for over 30 years.  </li>
      <li>The foam is so light.  </li>
      <li>I originally bought it at the salon</li>
      <li>It doubles the volume of your hair and your hair remains clean and glossy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure with &#x27;normal&#x27; hair, it would work just fine.</li>
      <li>This product smells really great which is about the only positive thing I can say about it.</li>
      <li>Delivery was quick.</li>
      <li>I have a very fine, color treated and sensitive hair</li>
      <li>Really made a difference with my fine thinning hair.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, the texture of my hair is fine and straight, but I have a lot of hair.</li>
      <li>It is not heavy or greasy which makes it my favorite.</li>
      <li>I have been using this for years on my long fine hair &amp; I love it.</li>
      <li>My stylist used this on my fine thinning hair and it actually did give more volume and also makes it look very shiny.</li>
      <li>There was noticeable thickness with these 3 Sebastian products after the first use.</li>
      <li>I first encountered it at the hair salon</li>
      <li>I found it humorous that the bottle said \\&quot;weightless volume\\&quot; because the only thing it added to my hair, was weight!</li>
      <li>I love this product, but this is the second time I ordered it and it does not foam.  </li>
      <li>however you spell it), Big Sexy Hair, and just about every product you can get at Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It makes my wet hair easier to comb, provides volume, and greatly reduces static (a big plus for me in a dry climate).</li>
      <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that really works.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff for my fine hair, keeps it from getting so flat later in the day.</li>
      <li>I am a little surprised by all of the good reviews for this product.  </li>
      <li>but you don&#x27;t have to use much.  </li>
      <li>Really like lightweight non-sticky consistency.</li>
      <li>Makes your hair sticky; doesn&#x27;t do much in the way of thickening, unless gummy hair is your thing.  </li>
      <li>The consistency is much like soapy water</li>
      <li>Works on my hair very well.  </li>
      <li>No matter how much I use, this foam does absolutely nothing for my hair.  </li>
      <li>REALLY works.  </li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;thickefy&amp;#34; foam really works.</li>
      <li>My hair is very fussy!&lt;br</li>
      <li>This, plus the Sebastian Light shampoo &amp; conditioner are a part of my daily beauty routine.</li>
      <li>The product itself is magnificent; does everything it promises, but getting the product out of the bottle is beyond irritating when I have one eye barely open in the morning.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to apply when wet and dries nicely using a round brush &amp; hair dryer.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I would not buy it again, didn&#x27;t like the texture of it, and didn&#x27;t work on my hair , very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Best product ever! I&#x27;ve tried numerous other products promising to bring volume to my hair. This is the only product that delivers! Volume and style without weight or stickiness. Love it!</li>
    <li> Tried it because the reviews I read! I really liked the Sabastian hairspray. Been using it for years. The mousse I use is gefden. So hard to find it so went thru Amazon. Decided to try the Sebastian mousse. I use both now.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to find a volumizing product that doesn&#x27;t make my hair fall flat within a couple hours, but this does it.  I add about 2 pumps to my wet chin length hair, blowdry through, then use a little hairspray at the end and it lasts for a few hours without having to touch it again.  Even when it does go a little flat, it doesn&#x27;t look greasy or lifeless.  This, plus the Sebastian Light shampoo &amp; conditioner are a part of my daily beauty routine.</li>
    <li> This is the nicest mousse that I&#x27;ve ever used.  I originally bought it at the salon but they no longer carry it so I ordered it online and it arrived quickly, nicely packaged.  It is not heavy or greasy which makes it my favorite.</li>
    <li> love this.....best product yet from Sebastian for my hair</li>
    <li> if you want volume then this is the product for you, I love it</li>
    <li> I have extremely straight, fine hair with absolutely no body, and this product has been unbelievable in giving my hair body without weighing it down......it is the first product of its kind which truly \\&quot;works\\&quot; on my hair without making it look \\&quot;greasy and flat\\&quot;..... and it only takes a small amount (about the size of a dime) for my short hair.  I will definitely be purchasing this product again; however, since it takes so little of the foam, I suspect this bottle will last a long time.  Hint.....I mainly put it on the roots which is working GREAT for me.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic!!! The foam does not weigh down fine hair and makes it look and feel much thicker.</li>
    <li> Good product and good price.  Can use the product to style hair dry or wet.</li>
    <li> I am extremely picky about my hair products--a lot of us are. That&#x27;s because we&#x27;ve actually found products that work; they actually do what they say they do, so why would I want to buy something that&#x27;s either mediocre or just doesn&#x27;t work? Sebastian&#x27;s Thickefy Foam works! I used Progaine Volumizing Foam for years until they stopped making it. It took me forever to find another hair product that would do what it said it would do--give my hair some body and not weigh it down. I knew Sebastian&#x27;s was different right away because of the information on their bottle. It said that they use a \\&quot;liquid to foam technology,\\&quot; and this must me why it works. In the bottle, you can see that it is a clear liquid, but it comes out as foam in the palm of your hand. The other foams/hair products that I tried not only started out as heavy creams but remained heavy and creamy in my hair, even when using a very, very small amount. Sebastian&#x27;s understands that thin hair--I would think any sort of hair--will only become weighed down, limp, oily looking, and lifeless if heavy cream is smeared all through it! Thank goodness for Sebastian&#x27;s \\&quot;liquid to foam technology.\\&quot; (Progaine Volumizing Foam was also a clear liquid in the bottle, which is why it worked so well.) I bought 5 bottles of the Thickefy Foam, and all I can do is hope that Sebastian&#x27;s gets the word out about this foam because once people try it, they will not want to buy any other foam or mousse. Only Sebastian&#x27;s Thickey Foam will do--and remember, you only need a little bit!</li>
    <li> Really made a difference with my fine thinning hair.  Adds great body.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair sticky; doesn&#x27;t do much in the way of thickening, unless gummy hair is your thing.  I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products and this is one actually thickens and gives volume to my thin hair. I use this every morning on damp short hair.  It is a light mousse foam that is easy to apply. There is no stickiness or bad smell. Doesn&#x27;t leave any noticeable residue that other hair products sometimes leave.  Hair remains soft. However, it is meant to thickefy your hair, not give it any hold.  The 6.8 bottle is fairly large and should last awhile since your only need a little for each application.  I will buy again once this bottle is done.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair look fuller.</li>
    <li> This has been the best product that I have used yet for holding my curls.  Wash, comb, and put this on your hair and scrunch.  REALLY works.  Keeps your hair shiny and curly all day.  It is a little expensive but you don&#x27;t have to use much.  I am really happy with this and will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a while now and love it.  I have very fine hair. Delivery was quick.</li>
    <li> Really light and good volume. I have thin and fine hair and it really works without weighing my hair down or tangling it.</li>
    <li> Sebastian discontinued its Body Double and I was hoping that this was a good substitute.  It is not at all as good, but adequate.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but this is the second time I ordered it and it does not foam.  I will be buying in the store from now on.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of the Sebastian Shaper Hair spray; having used it now for over 30 years.  It is by far the best product line I can find.</li>
    <li> The SebastianThickefy Foam is a product that I have used for years.  It is the best product for giving fuller body to my hair.</li>
    <li> does a good job and it is very light on the hair</li>
    <li> This product made my fine hair stiff and sticky and hard to brush out and style. I tried several times to adjust the amount I used because so many of the other reviews I read were so positive that I thought it must be that I was using too much or too little.  I got 4 uses out of a $15.00+ bottle when the pump locked up and instead of releasing a foam only leaked out a milky watery liquid. I tried several times to get the pump to \\&quot;release\\&quot; so I could generate foam to no avail and finally gave up and threw a barely used product away. I&#x27;m very disappointed.  Save your money and buy something else!</li>
    <li> There is a long list of products that do not work for my baby fine, thin, wavy hair. Among them are almost all the Tigi products, Fekkai (or however you spell it), Big Sexy Hair, and just about every product you can get at Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d settled on using cheapo Aussie mousse until I could find something that didn&#x27;t make me look like a depressed rat every time I put it on my head. I tried this based on user reviews, and could not be happier with the results. If you&#x27;re on the fence about trying this and you have fine hair you should give it a shot.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have fine hair and this product gives me the little extra I need to make my hair fuller and feel soft.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at Ulta and only gave it two days until I returned it. I have very fine, limp hair and I need to have some sort of product in my hair to style it {or even look like I have hair on my head}. This product smells really great which is about the only positive thing I can say about it. I followed the directions on the bottle and then blow dryed my hair and it was so heavy on my hair! I found it humorous that the bottle said \\&quot;weightless volume\\&quot; because the only thing it added to my hair, was weight! I&#x27;ve heard a few girlfriends suggest Aquage Foam Root Lifter so I&#x27;m off to try that.</li>
    <li> Really like lightweight non-sticky consistency.</li>
    <li> When I recieved it, it was like water and for some reason still does not come out as foam.  I have used this product for quite a few years and it has never been this way.  I am disappointed in this bottle.  It&#x27;s like they have changed it somehow!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  My hairdresser put me on to this product.  I&#x27;ve got thin / very fine hair.  The &amp;#34;thickefy&amp;#34; foam really works.</li>
    <li> Four pumps is the way to go.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product along with Sebastian Volumizing shampoo and conditioner and I definitely noticed a difference right away!  I have purchased several volumizing products and none seem to make much of a difference.  There was noticeable thickness with these 3 Sebastian products after the first use.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is a God send for people with fine hair.  It give body and life to fine hair.  I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s a bit pricey. I make sure to check if they&#x27;re on sale before I buy it. I have a very fine, color treated and sensitive hair so I make sure I test the product for a week and if it&#x27;s causing more harm or doing nothing to my hair I toss it and I look for another brand. Luckily this brand works for me so buy it if you have the same hair.</li>
    <li> I first tried this in combination with another styling product and was very unhappy with the results. However, used alone after shampooing and conditioning with Sebastian Volupt, I am very pleased with Thickefy (although my brain keeps seeing the name as Thickety...which I kinda like better than Thickefy!) Anyway, the texture of my hair is fine and straight, but I have a lot of hair. Without product, it looks like a stringy mop. Thickefy works quite well to create volume and fullness in my hair, and helps to hold my style all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and I use it as a  styling product as well as a thickener.</li>
    <li> I love Sebastian products but this just didn&#x27;t work well for me. I have very fine thin hair and this did not give me enough body.  My hair is very fussy!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure with &#x27;normal&#x27; hair, it would work just fine.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  The foam is so light.  It gives my hair bounce without weighing it down.  I have used this product for several years now.  I think it&#x27;s the best on the market.</li>
    <li> I love that Sebastian thickefy foam is so light and airy when you pump it out. It&#x27;s so easy to apply when wet and dries nicely using a round brush &amp; hair dryer. I first encountered it at the hair salon I go to so I decided I have to have it. I think the price is fair and the product does what it&#x27;s supposed to, it helps my thin, flat hair seem thicker and fuller. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for some time and have not found anything that works better.</li>
    <li> Excellent product that works very well with my very fine straight hair. It makes my wet hair easier to comb, provides volume, and greatly reduces static (a big plus for me in a dry climate). Unlike some reviewers, I haven&#x27;t found that it makes my hair sticky at all. Generally, three pumps seems to be right for my shoulder length hair. The bottle lasts a long time also. After two months of close to daily use, it&#x27;s maybe about half gone.</li>
    <li> Basically does what it claims to do, although it&#x27;s more about making your hair more manageable and shapely without stickiness or crunchiness. Does not seem thickefy through volume, though.</li>
    <li> It is crap. There is no foam at all. when I use, all that comes out is liquid but no foam.</li>
    <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that really works.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down, and it doesn&#x27;t get gummy, even in a humid climate.  It combs out without leaving the hair feeling dirty or sticky,and  it doesn&#x27;t dry the hair out of make it look dull.  And I have very, very fine hair and have tried all kinds of products.  This is by far the very best I&#x27;ve ever used and I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff!!  it works wonderfully and I do not want to be without it.  If you are considering buying it just go on and do it.  I have found it best to use with damp hair and then blow dry.</li>
    <li> The product itself is magnificent; does everything it promises, but getting the product out of the bottle is beyond irritating when I have one eye barely open in the morning. The pump is faulty. You press down once and it never pops back up, I have to pull it up and press again, pull it again and press til I get the amount of product in my hand that I want. Meanwhile dropping some on the counter or myself. Why cant the bottle just be magnificent like the product. Not sure I will buy again because of it :(</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this foam as an alternative to using a mousse which usually has a lot of alcohol in it and tends to dry out the hair. The consistency is much like soapy water and I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with the results. I will probably stick with regular mousse or gel for my styling needs.</li>
    <li> Works on my hair very well.  I like this product.</li>
    <li> It is rather runny when you pump it from the bottle.  It should be more &amp;#34;foamy&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Love this product, it&#x27;s discontinued where I&#x27;m from - not sure if its discontinued in the USA.  I was glad to see it available. I have pixie short, fine, thin hair. I need products that provide volume and a little texture without any buildup. This is it. As it promises, weightless and flexible. It isn&#x27;t a miracle of thickening, I won&#x27;t lie, but it is a great, light styling product that provides light hold and volume.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use. It doubles the volume of your hair and your hair remains clean and glossy. I will you this product again.I purchased it at Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I am a little surprised by all of the good reviews for this product.  No matter how much I use, this foam does absolutely nothing for my hair.  It does not give my hair any lift or body.  (I have fine, shoulder length hair).  I&#x27;m not sure if I just got a bad bottle, but this was a total waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> Very nice thickening foam for fine hair.  I have been using this for years on my long fine hair &amp; I love it. It adds texture &amp; fullness. I would recommend to anyone with fine hair.  Other products are too heavy that I have tried, but this is light &amp; doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. Also costs less at Amazon than in the local Beauty Supply Store.</li>
    <li> Met all my requirements.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff for my fine hair, keeps it from getting so flat later in the day. Never sticky either.........</li>
    <li> My stylist used this on my fine thinning hair and it actually did give more volume and also makes it look very shiny. It does not weight my hair down or make it look dirty as some other products I have previously tried.</li>
    <li> This foam adds a nice amount of volume without leaving it too sticky.  I normally don&#x27;t like using hairspray like products but this isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
    <li> Love it - have used it for years</li>
    <li> Not the best volumetric product I have come across.  I like that it is soft and bouncy but did not give my desired look. Thought I would try something new, I liked it but know better.</li>
    <li> Overall, I would not purchase this again.  I didn&#x27;t notice thicker hair.  I did love the smell!  I prefer other volumizing foam over this one.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!!  Sebastian used to make a product years ago that I loved, then they discontinued it.  I&#x27;ve been looking for it, off and on for years, hoping they would bring it back.  And they did!  Now it&#x27;s called Thickefy Foam.  This product makes me feel like I have a full head of hair!</li>
