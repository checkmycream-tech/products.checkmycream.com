### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Hopefully they can do something to perfect it !</li>
      <li>This was perfect for me.</li>
      <li>Great coverage.</li>
      <li>Great stuff.</li>
      <li>happy  wife, happy life</li>
      <li>It is a great stain but your eye lashes will feel like they have bondo or superglue on them for a couple of days.  </li>
      <li>It is great for humid climates, or if you are just looking to add definition to lighter eyelashes.</li>
      <li>good for water sports</li>
      <li>It was a good idea</li>
      <li>It was delivered quickly and I am very happy with it.</li>
      <li>and I never have to wash it off, it just kind of wears away.</li>
      <li>I used it very lightly on my blond eyelashes.  </li>
      <li>i think you would do better to see a salon  </li>
      <li>I love the product.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Dries up in the tube very quickly</li>
      <li>I have found that waterproof masacara did a more effective lasting of color.</li>
      <li>So I decided to take my old tint tube and wand, clean it the best I could and dipped the brush/wand in the hard candy tint and put it in the tube, I then applied and got a much more even and manageable application.</li>
      <li>I really think in reading the reviews that it is more for those who are looking for a more natural look.  </li>
      <li>I am fair with light lashes and not a make-up wearer, but wanted something to make my lashes a little darker.</li>
      <li>I really felt comfortable wearing this mascara.</li>
      <li>A classy look for sure.</li>
      <li>It clumps and deposits on top of eyelash area and below the lashes if you are not very careful.</li>
      <li>I have very light lashes and with the promise of this lash stain, it is suppose to hold up for 4 days, it did not last one day.  </li>
      <li>When applied lightly is would lengthen or darken eyelashes as most any other mascara would.</li>
      <li>Seems to do the trick, even in hot weather.</li>
      <li>This is my first ever review.  </li>
      <li>did not dye lashes  left smudges which means i am kind of glad it is not really a dye</li>
      <li>Clumps and smudges a bit more than expected.</li>
      <li>Flaked into my eyes causing extreme itching and burning the very first day!!</li>
      <li>I use eye makeup remover to take off my other eye makeup, which also removes most of this mascara.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited and hopeful that this would actually preform like it claimed.</li>
      <li>Most mascaras only last one or two hours.</li>
      <li>Adequate replacement for Neutrogena&#x27;s recently discontinued lash tint.</li>
      <li>Not heavy and did not smear at all.</li>
      <li>I like the natural look for me.  </li>
      <li>My lashes appeared thicker and black, I&#x27;m fine with that being blonde</li>
      <li>I have thick naturally curly lashes, they are just light.  </li>
      <li>The second day, I can barely tell there&#x27;s mascara there.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on this, just buy a high quality stain or mascara!!</li>
      <li>It dries super hard and brittle, then it flakes off onto your cheeks below your eyes.  </li>

<li> long lasting lash tint.</li>
<li> I have a hard time with mascaras because I have very curly lashes</li>
<li> I would def buy again, the ink stain is thin, more wet than mascara, you must apply slowly and take your time, I did get some above my upper lashes, applied to lower lashes with tip of wand, did get some below bottom lashes, removed with Q-tip dipped in eye makeup remover.</li>
<li> I first applied with the applicator it came with and found it really liquid and hard to apply with my lashes looking way to gunky, thick and dark.</li>
<li> If you wear the whole makeup section at once and prefer the dramatic looks, try one of their thickening mascaras.</li>
<li> And it did stay on for a few days but became flaky and dry.</li>
<li> I rated it as a 5 because that&#x27;s what I wanted my lashes to be dark.</li>
<li> , it takes some time to apply, not a quick apply and out the door thing.</li>
<li> I get a little darkening under the eyes at times, but am very active in sports.</li>
<li> I was not sure how to try to remove it until I read the other comments.</li>
<li> A little eyeshadow and mascara are all I do.  </li>
<li> Also, the formula is thick, which makes it hard to apply to tiny lashes</li>
<li> I went slowly and carefully.  </li>
<li> It lasts a few days</li>
<li> you look so pale without mascara, I don&#x27;t like to apply mascara every day, it stayed on after sleeping, after shower, its a lash ink stain</li>
<li> Cant see what the negative reviews are about.</li>
<li> It left my eyelashes so clumpy and it was impossible to remove.</li>
<li> I was not impressed, but I was going for a very subtle look.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
<li> For those who wear makeup and think this will replace mascara, they will be disappointed.  </li>
<li> This brand is the worst!</li>
<li> This is horrible.</li>
<li> This product is awful.</li>

    <li> I was so excited and hopeful that this would actually preform like it claimed.It went on clumpy and didn&#x27;t actually stay on like it claimed. Hopefully they can do something to perfect it !</li>
    <li> It is a great stain but your eye lashes will feel like they have bondo or superglue on them for a couple of days.  It dries super hard and brittle, then it flakes off onto your cheeks below your eyes.  A classy look for sure.</li>
    <li> Adequate replacement for Neutrogena&#x27;s recently discontinued lash tint. Clumps and smudges a bit more than expected. Time to break out the eyelash comb.</li>
    <li> Dries up in the tube very quickly</li>
    <li> The product says it&#x27;s 4 day lash stain mascara - it only lasted one day on my eyelashes. Most mascaras only last one or two hours.</li>
    <li> This is my first ever review.  I bought this from Walmart. $7  I really think in reading the reviews that it is more for those who are looking for a more natural look.  I used it very lightly on my blond eyelashes.  It did not clump.  I went slowly and carefully.  It gave added color to my lashes.  Im not a makeup person.  A little eyeshadow and mascara are all I do.  I have a hard time with mascaras because I have very curly lashes and they always caused mine to clump together.  I like the natural look for me.  Im low maintenance.  For those who wear makeup and think this will replace mascara, they will be disappointed.  I have thick naturally curly lashes, they are just light.  This was perfect for me.</li>
    <li> long lasting lash tint. good for water sports</li>
    <li> happy  wife, happy life</li>
    <li> I bought this when I could not find the lash tint I had been using. I am fair with light lashes and not a make-up wearer, but wanted something to make my lashes a little darker. I first applied with the applicator it came with and found it really liquid and hard to apply with my lashes looking way to gunky, thick and dark. But I am not an expert at applying mascara. And it did stay on for a few days but became flaky and dry. I was not impressed, but I was going for a very subtle look. So I decided to take my old tint tube and wand, clean it the best I could and dipped the brush/wand in the hard candy tint and put it in the tube, I then applied and got a much more even and manageable application. It lasts a few days and I never have to wash it off, it just kind of wears away. I get a little darkening under the eyes at times, but am very active in sports.</li>

    <li> This product does not perform as instructed.  I have very light lashes and with the promise of this lash stain, it is suppose to hold up for 4 days, it did not last one day.  I have found that waterproof masacara did a more effective lasting of color.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but I felt the need to warn consumers. This product is awful. It left my eyelashes so clumpy and it was impossible to remove. When applied lightly is would lengthen or darken eyelashes as most any other mascara would. It was a good idea but it did not deliver well.</li>
    <li> I love the product. It was delivered quickly and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Have bought before and will again. Doesn&#x27;t give me raccoon eyes, doesn&#x27;t rub off. Seems to do the trick, even in hot weather.</li>
    <li> Great coverage. Cant see what the negative reviews are about. It is a stain. Not a traditional mascara. It is great for humid climates, or if you are just looking to add definition to lighter eyelashes. If you wear the whole makeup section at once and prefer the dramatic looks, try one of their thickening mascaras.</li>
    <li> Wish it stayed on longer.</li>
    <li> This is horrible. Not an actual stain, just a crappy ultra waterproof mascara-that is not even waterproof at all!! Flaked into my eyes causing extreme itching and burning the very first day!! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this, just buy a high quality stain or mascara!!</li>
    <li> Actually a long-wearing mascara and not a lash stain.  At the beauty salon, a lash tint means they dye my eyelashes, so the lashes are darker but not any thicker.  I thought I would get a temporary version of this effect from a lash stain.  This mascara coats my lashes but the color of the underlying lashes doesn&#x27;t change.  Also, the formula is thick, which makes it hard to apply to tiny lashes and then it clumps on my bigger lashes.  I use eye makeup remover to take off my other eye makeup, which also removes most of this mascara.  The second day, I can barely tell there&#x27;s mascara there.  I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item at Walmart. Big mistake. It clumps and deposits on top of eyelash area and below the lashes if you are not very careful. There were no instructions included. I was not sure how to try to remove it until I read the other comments. I would not recommend at all.</li>
    <li> The mascara I ordered that was supposed to stay put for 4 days gave me \\&quot;raccoon eyes\\&quot; within hours. I went out and bought their waterproof mascara that came off in the water and smudged all over. This brand is the worst! Stick with Maybelline waterproof.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I can go to the gym and it never smears or runs. It lasts 4 days!</li>
    <li> I really felt comfortable wearing this mascara. Not heavy and did not smear at all. It was just what I have been looking for.</li>
