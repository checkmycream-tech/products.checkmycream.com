      <li>so glad i bought this stuff.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>My hair still looked OK.  </li>
      <li>This hair product is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products while styling my hair and after a couple of hours any curl in my hair is gone.  </li>
      <li>Wish it was more affordable.  </li>
      <li>alot better</li>
      <li>It has some greasy feel to it, but not horrible like the palmade which is more of an adhesive than a gel.   </li>
      <li>Your will stay in place when the wind blows that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
      <li>Liquid was forming at the top, pearlescent bluish in color,</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I have been using TIGI Bed Head Manipulator for many years.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a must-have product for people who love making their hair wacky and fun!!</li>
      <li>If I&#x27;m going out at night after a full day at work I just touch it up with my iron and don&#x27;t even need to use more product!  </li>
      <li>NEVER HAVE CALM HAIR AGAIN WITHOUT IT !!</li>
      <li>I apply it to wet hair for best effect.  </li>
      <li>The old formula was a great product.</li>
      <li>It smells good, it&#x27;s not too sticky, and for shortish hair, it&#x27;s really good for controlling it and the control lasts for a quite long time.</li>
      <li>Washes out easily.</li>
      <li>The product is so cool,shipping was safe and quick..</li>
      <li>It gives hold to your hair style and is especially great for those with limp, fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve happily used this product for several years.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to purchase more right after I write this review, lol.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, straight hair and a ton of it!  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s well worth the price!  </li>
      <li>The price has increased since I originally purchased this</li>
      <li>I will be looking for another product for my styling needs unless TIGI restores the original formula, or something closer to it.  </li>
      <li>so you have to use more than the higher quality product.</li>
      <li>and this stuff works great to give me that messy, chunky look I love.  </li>
      <li>use it all the time, the taste is OK for a hair product and when spread lightly on crackers compliments cheese very well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It works well, adds body and texture to your hair with just a tiny amount, is not greasy, and has pleasant smell.  </li>
      <li>just right!      </li>
      <li>Product was shipped right away, had it in 4 days!</li>
      <li>You have to use a good deal of it, however, if you want to spike your hair, where it actually stands up in controlled</li>
      <li>the deep turquoise paste that I loved.  </li>
      <li>Super runny</li>
      <li>I experimented with a huge array of products promising this and that.  </li>
      <li>This is just amazing, so versatile and when left in the fridge even cold.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>You rarely see TIGI Bed Head Manipulator on Amazon and they are not supposed to sell it here</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know about you, but right after a shower and no styling hair leaves me with an amorphous \\&quot;fro.\\</li>
      <li>and then I head right into a meeting.  </li>
      <li>the plus side, if this was the original formula, I would be pretty happy, because I was actually shipped 2 x 2oz containers, was only expecting one.</li>
      <li>I just take a little bit on my finger and fix any hairs that are out of place, and it smells pleasant and gives a bit of shine.</li>
      <li>This product is really good if you like your hair to be a little crunchy.</li>
      <li>I did get this product exactly when was told.  </li>
      <li>After buying 1 unit for $17 I will for sure be coming to Amazon for my next purchase.</li>
      <li>was unsure about this product when the hairdresser first introduced me to this product.  </li>
      <li>With this seller, you save so much money, buying 2 jars for the price of 1 at salons!</li>
      <li>This stuff is phenomenal for giving an edgy, chunky look to my super fine hair.</li>
      <li>Great for making straight hair have a little extra pazzaz!</li>
      <li>Plus, it really holds your hair style all day without making your hair oily.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended though for the shorter hair!</li>
      <li>Upon contacting the seller it took over a week for them to check with their supplier, then told me that no such product was available.</li>
      <li>It is very sticky but that is why it works.  </li>
      <li>I recommend it highly!</li>
      <li>But after seeing that it works in all kinds of weather and even after an intense sweaty workout.  </li>
      <li>so much for knowing their customers.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much of anything unless you use a lot, at which point it can make your hair look greasy.</li>
      <li>I can get out of bed, without washing my hair, put some manipulator in my hair to give it height, and head off to work without much fuss.  </li>
      <li>Much happier.</li>
      <li>This works sooo much</li>
      <li>and I now just use this product to smooth and direct hair in a way that looks natural.      </li>
      <li>Whether they changed the formula to increase profit margins or to comply with regulations on new ingredients as they have suggested on the FB site, the truth remains that this is not at all like the old product and unfortunately is no longer worth using.</li>
      <li>It is not their fault that the product formula has changed, but I mention it so that you are aware that they are already shipping the new formula.  </li>
      <li>I tried 4 or 5 other products before Bed Head products were recommended to me, and I love it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is just amazing, so versatile and when left in the fridge even cold.&lt;br /&gt;I use it all the time, the taste is OK for a hair product and when spread lightly on crackers compliments cheese very well.&lt;br /&gt;It can also be used in your hair. A minimum hair  length of 1/8&amp;#34; is recommended. It also lasts very long, the last jar I had lasted me all the way until it was gone.</li>
    <li> I use ICE Spiker when I&#x27;m at work.  I wear a hard-hat several times throughout the day and then I head right into a meeting.  It works great for that but it&#x27;s like wearing a helmet of preserved hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Manipulator is what I used aside from work.  It has great hold but my hair isn&#x27;t 40 Rockwell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve happily used this product for several years. I have short hair and Manipulator provides some \\&quot;character\\&quot; to my hair.  Without it, my hair just looks rather fuzzy and plain.      I like how Manipulator allows my hair to stay soft and have movement. It doesn&#x27;t cause my hair to become stiff like a board.      Love it.</li>
    <li> TIGI Bed Head Manipulator is a fantastic product that salons usually use on my hair. It&#x27;s very thin putty, so it makes it easier to get that messy, just-got-out-of-bed look! Plus, it really holds your hair style all day without making your hair oily. With this seller, you save so much money, buying 2 jars for the price of 1 at salons! And only a little bit of Manipulator goes a long way, so 2 jars last a long time. It also has a wonderful coconut smell! It&#x27;s a must-have product for people who love making their hair wacky and fun!! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I have very unruly, uneven, wirey-to-wavy-to-curly hair.  This product is the baby bear of products for me.  Not too thick, not too thin, not too stiff...just right!      I experimented with a huge array of products promising this and that.  When I had short spiky hair, I found that this product plus the hair stick a perfect combo for awesome hair.  Now my hair is way down my back and I now just use this product to smooth and direct hair in a way that looks natural.      I pay particular attention to the part and edges, but run the product thinly throughout the rest of the hair.  I apply it to wet hair for best effect.  If I miss it and let it get dry, then I end up using way too much product and get a slight sticky effect.  Really, I only need at most three finger tips worth of light dabbing into the product twice for all my super thick, long hair.    I don&#x27;t know about you, but right after a shower and no styling hair leaves me with an amorphous \\&quot;fro.\\&quot;  This product allows me to have that third day after a shower look with the added bonus of clean hair.    I also need to use Joico&#x27;s Silk Result conditioner for thick hair...very nice.  Joico&#x27;s Silk Result shampoo is a good primer for the conditioner, but horrible at cleaning hair...I use Tigi Control Freak shampoo for cleaning...but it could be anything (I like the smell of pineapples).</li>
    <li> Been using this manipulator since 2002. When I received my order in 1/2013, It smelled different, felt different, and looked different, so I thought I got a bad batch of manipulator. But after researching online, I discovered TIGI changed the formula of their product. It doesn&#x27;t do much of anything unless you use a lot, at which point it can make your hair look greasy. Because you have to use more of it, it gets used up faster, which makes the product more expensive than it used to be. All in all very disappointed with the changes to this product!! I will be searching for something new next time.</li>
    <li> Just received item much earlier than expected. Items are new and at this price, a great deal!! My husband loves this stuff. It last forever!! Will definitely be buying again when he runs out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for Bed Head&#x27;s Manipulator. This stuff is phenomenal for giving an edgy, chunky look to my super fine hair. It is very gooey and can easily weigh down your hair if you use too much. It may take a few tries to figure out how to work this stuff right, but it is totally worth it.</li>
    <li> My wife originally bought this from a local store for my son, but I used it when I ran out of my regular DEP gel. This works sooo much betterAnd doesn&#x27;t give you flakes like gel does. Plus, your hair is not like a helmet. Even though it costs more than gel, it&#x27;s a lot less expensive in the long run since 1 tub lasts 3-4 months since you don&#x27;t have to use very much and you get it on the subscription.</li>
    <li> I have been using Bed Head Maniuplator for quite some time based upon the fact that my hairdresser uses the product and it holds my hair in place.  I can get out of bed, without washing my hair, put some manipulator in my hair to give it height, and head off to work without much fuss.  I recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> Product was shipped right away, had it in 4 days! The product works very well too, keeps hair in place without the hard, crunchy look and feel of gel or hair spray.</li>
    <li> I have super short hair... somewhat of a pixie cut and this stuff works great to give me that messy, chunky look I love.  A little goes a long way.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This works great with my hairstyle.  A little goes a long way!  It is very sticky but that is why it works.  It is the best value at Amazon.  I have not seen it any cheaper anywhere else than $15.95 (for 2 oz.) for one unless on sale.  Great value here!    The price has increased since I originally purchased this but if you use the automatic shipment option you get a discount and it is still cheaper than a beauty store.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my mom to style and texturize her short hair. She likes it.</li>
    <li> All the Bed Head products are expensive and this styling hold is no exception.  In Target it is over $13 for 2 oz.  However, it is an excellent product.  I discovered it when I borrowed it from my nephew upon discovering it in his bathroom.  It gives hold to your hair style and is especially great for those with limp, fine hair.  With enough of it, you can give your hair a wet look. It has a pleasant scent as well.  Now my husband discovered it in our bathroom and is borrowing my can of it.  This product just asks to be borrowed if you leave it out in a bathroom.  If you put just a little on your fingertips and run it through your hair, it will give you more volume and hold to your style. You won&#x27;t even be able to feel it.  You have to use a good deal of it, however, if you want to spike your hair, where it actually stands up in controlled spikes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and it is, hands-down, the best product I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s light but gives good control. Excellent!</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this for years, from spiked hair to casual it works great.  I even put a dab in my long hair to calm it down.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, straight hair and a ton of it!  I&#x27;ve tried so many products while styling my hair and after a couple of hours any curl in my hair is gone.  Not anymore!!!  I rub a dime sized amount in my hands and just use it on the bottom 1/3 of my hair and I have hold ALL DAY LONG.  If I&#x27;m going out at night after a full day at work I just touch it up with my iron and don&#x27;t even need to use more product!  This stuff is a bit expensive but you don&#x27;t need a lot and it&#x27;s well worth the price!  After buying 1 unit for $17 I will for sure be coming to Amazon for my next purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple years now, typically going through about one of these things every 3-4 months, so it definitely lasts!   As for the day to day use - this product is great for getting that \\&quot;not too slicked\\&quot; look into your \\&quot;do\\&quot;. I do have a hard time sometimes since my hair is a bit curly, so it&#x27;s note for those that want to straighten - just for the moderate/natural style and hold.   It has some greasy feel to it, but not horrible like the palmade which is more of an adhesive than a gel.   I&#x27;ve slept on it before, and it&#x27;s not too nasty the next day, but as any hair product it&#x27;s best to at least run your head under the sink before hitting the sack!  Highly recommended though for the shorter hair!</li>
    <li> I was looking for some sort of finishing cream to touch up any flyaways and get baby hair out of my face. Bed Head Manipulator can be a little messy and goopy, but it REALLY works. I just take a little bit on my finger and fix any hairs that are out of place, and it smells pleasant and gives a bit of shine. The 2 oz jar is perfect, because it is easy to travel with. And now that I got this product, I think I am going to take it EVERYWHERE.</li>
    <li> I have used this product to add body and style to my hair for about 4 years.  I tried 4 or 5 other products before Bed Head products were recommended to me, and I love it.  It works well, adds body and texture to your hair with just a tiny amount, is not greasy, and has pleasant smell.  I was paying $18 for one 2oz container at the store, so I was very happy to find it much more reasonably priced at amazon!</li>
    <li> I just recieved this product and it only came with one product not 2 as advertised. I looked at the shipping label and it states 1 bed head for $23.70. Big rip off.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great product!    TIGI products are always amazing!    I ordered this product because its very difficult to find in stores.    Excelent price and it is really a good product.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that it would help keep my hairs shape alot better then it does but it smells great and does help somewhat to keep my curl.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this product for several years now.  No complaints or desire to switch to anything else!  Works all day.  Washes out easily.</li>
    <li> Great for making straight hair have a little extra pazzaz! Style and just add a bit to hair and away you go!</li>
    <li> MY SECRET TO HAVING NON FREEZY CURLS  !!!  MY NUMBER ONE STYLING PRODUCT !&lt;br /&gt;GOOD NEVER HAVE CALM HAIR AGAIN WITHOUT IT !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen on Amazon that you can get a 4 oz. jar of this for [...] (about) but then there is the [...] bucks shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Well I think that I&#x27;d rather just have the (2) 2 oz jars.  I makes it easier to travel, handle and store.(if you are pressed for space in the medicine cabinet.)&lt;br /&gt;I was unsure about this product when the hairdresser first introduced me to this product.  But after seeing that it works in all kinds of weather and even after an intense sweaty workout.  My hair still looked OK.  I would recommend this for anyone with moderately short hair that still wants some flexibility.</li>
    <li> My wife loves TIGI Bed Head Manipulator Styling Cream 2.0 oz.. Bext deal at the time that I bought it.</li>
    <li> Used to use this product...got this a couple of weeks ago and it is terrible.,  won&#x27;t be purchasing on line anymore.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Buy it all the time</li>
    <li> The item I ordered clearly stated (pack of 2) I received one item. Upon contacting the seller it took over a week for them to check with their supplier, then told me that no such product was available. They said I could return the item for a refund or they would credit me $10. I accepted the later. I could have gotten that price at my local mall so I won&#x27;t be ordering this product on line again or at least from this seller. I was disappointed and thought it was a hastle.</li>
    <li> Great product works great</li>
    <li> The seller sent my order promptly. I would buy from this seller again. However it seems that the formula for Tigi Bed Head  Manipulator has been changed. The old formula was a great product.The new product is terrible. It is a heavy, greasy mess. After I received my order I went on-line to see if anyone else had  problem and discovered that I wasn&#x27;t alone. If the company keeps this new formula I will never buy another BedHead product again. I sent an email to Tigi about this weeks ago but I haven&#x27;t received any reply.</li>
    <li> Excellant product and shipped timely.  I did get this product exactly when was told.  It was packeaged well.&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> Bed Head Manipulator is the best styling product I&#x27;ve ever used. Hair stays in place all day.  Will only use this product!</li>
    <li> I love using this stuff. It smells good, it&#x27;s not too sticky, and for shortish hair, it&#x27;s really good for controlling it and the control lasts for a quite long time.</li>
    <li> This hair product is my favorite. It doesn&#x27;t work really well for super long hair, but when my hair is short, it work works like a charm. so glad i bought this stuff. Highly Recommend.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product did not meet my expectations.  I have been purchasing Bed Head Manipulator for years.&lt;br /&gt;This one is watery &amp; stringy.</li>
    <li> I actually just started to go through my past purchases and wanted to finally leave feedback for other people since it&#x27;s helped me with my purchases. I just noticed the new price on this hair gel/paste and it&#x27;s at an amazing price right now!!! Holy cow, only $6 when it&#x27;s $19 in other stores and supermarkets. I&#x27;m definitely going to purchase more right after I write this review, lol. THANK YOU AMAZON!!!</li>
    <li> This was my favorite hair product, they changed the formula, it is now runny and does not work as good. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a couple years.  it was nice to find it lots cheaper than at the salons.</li>
    <li> I have short hair and this stuff is great! Not too mention I saved over half price buying this on Amazon.  This will last me quite a while as a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> The product is so cool,shipping was safe and quick..</li>
    <li> i love this stuff, but publix sales a copy cat product which works just as good. you can even find this on sale at Ulta sometimes.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without this gook.  Wish it was more affordable.  Trying to find another product with this ability to work but less strenuous on purse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a manipulator consumer for several years. Within the last six months I noticed the product would have wild swings in consistency. One time it would be runny, the other hard as paste. It was clear the product was not being consistent as I found these changes consistent over different retailers including salon retailers. When I wrote the company merely to point out the fact given i had used the product and liked it, I was dismissed. I&#x27;ve now switched to AQUAGE TRANSFORMING PASTE. Much happier. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> This product is really good if you like your hair to be a little crunchy. Your will stay in place when the wind blows that&#x27;s for sure. I have really short hair</li>
    <li> I used to love this product, have used for 3+ years.  Worked really well on my thin, fine hair. Just got a new jar and its watery, gooey, and looks watered down. I left it out, opened for two weeks to try and get it to the consistency it used to be. It&#x27;s still sloppy wet. Soo disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and just a lil of this gives me lots of shine with a nice natural hold.  Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Product container has been refilled with cr_ap. Liquid was forming at the top, pearlescent bluish in color, perfumey smell...NOT MAINIPULATOR! Is that illegal to refill a container? What about germs ...h_ell with it no more amazon</li>
    <li> Description was that of a 2 pack so ordered three and expected to get 6 singles and only received 3 singles for the same cost shown. Still a good deal but not a great deal.</li>
    <li> I have been using TIGI Bed Head Manipulator for many years.  I was very disappointed to learn that the formula has changed.  My order was sold by HBC DEPOT.  It is not their fault that the product formula has changed, but I mention it so that you are aware that they are already shipping the new formula.  The re-formulation has a different scent, a different texture, and it doesn&#x27;t work as well.  Each of the aforementioned attributes have been downgraded in my opinion.  I will be looking for another product for my styling needs unless TIGI restores the original formula, or something closer to it.  I&#x27;m hoping that if enough vendors are upset with poor ratings, they will contact TIGI and insist the formula be restored to the original (or closer to it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, if this was the original formula, I would be pretty happy, because I was actually shipped 2 x 2oz containers, was only expecting one.</li>
    <li> I had used this product for 6 years and loved it. I always kept a spare on hand.  Yesterday I opened my Bed Head Manipulator  spare  and the formula was changed. It was a purley blue and very runny, and the product had separated.... not at all  the deep turquoise paste that I loved.  I called the manufacturer and they want to send me a complementary gift.  They also told me that because I purchased my product at Target  that it was a knock off and that Target was not one of their customers. They only sell to \\&quot;Salons\\&quot;.  They referred me to a salon that I went to today and was  told  that they had not carried Bed Head for several years.... so much for knowing their customers.&lt;br /&gt; I want  my Bed Head Manipulator  back.. and I want someone to talk to the dude that decided to change the formula. It no longer holds my hair in place is heavy and just weights my hair down.  Who makes these decisions to change the products?</li>
    <li> This seemed thicker and sticky compared to last batch......but still an awesome hair product.</li>
    <li> It came on time and was packaged well, but it was not the salon (sp?) quality product.  I&#x27;ve been using the same product for years but its $19 for a small container in a store.  This product was cheaper but not of the same quality.  Super runny so you have to use more than the higher quality product.</li>
    <li> As many have discovered, the formula for Bed Head Manipulator has been changed. All of the people that thought they received counterfeit products in fact received the new formula. Personally I thought that there was something wrong with my latest until until some quick research confirmed that the formula was changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this was my go to product, but now I cannot recommend this for anyone. Whether they changed the formula to increase profit margins or to comply with regulations on new ingredients as they have suggested on the FB site, the truth remains that this is not at all like the old product and unfortunately is no longer worth using.</li>
    <li> I have bought TIGI Bed Head Manipulator for years, so I know what I am talking about.  Normally this is a thick creamy product that only requires a little dab.  The product I received was so runny it you couldn&#x27;t get it out of the jar.  I brought it to my local hair salon where I normally buy it what the deal is with this.  She said it is either a knock off, or it was damaged in shipping.  She said from time to time they would get their hair gel in from Bed Head with similar characteristics, she said she thinks if it freezes, or overheats during shipping, it loses its thick consistency.  You rarely see TIGI Bed Head Manipulator on Amazon and they are not supposed to sell it here, I am guessing the vendor knew this was damaged and didn&#x27;t want to sell it in their store, and didn&#x27;t want to throw it away.</li>
