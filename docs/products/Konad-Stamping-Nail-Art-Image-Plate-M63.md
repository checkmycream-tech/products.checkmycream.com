    <li> Loved this plate water marbling made easy</li>
    <li> cute designs! too bad i  ordered this plate after i found all my options on amazon to get bundle sets for half the price!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this plate mostly because of the houndstooth! It is my absolute favorite design! Houndstooth looks amazing using black polish on top of a white, pink, or any other background! Love it!</li>
    <li> I like these designs for stamping but I rarely stamp because it takes awhile. I personally like nail stickers better even though they can be more expensive but I don&#x27;t use all the time.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this plate. It holds the polish well so that the transfer to the stamper is always 100% success. I have not used all of the designs but the ones I used were awesome! Great delivery speed from the seller could not complain.</li>
    <li> Very nice plate. All of the images stamp great! They all come out nice and clear. My daughter enjoys using this plate also.</li>
    <li> These plates are really nice but are way overpriced! especially for just one plate! you can get the same plates for alot cheaper if you look at Bundle Monster and Cheeky Products.</li>
    <li> Great condition - gorgeous patterns.</li>
    <li> takes a  little  bit  too  figure out  how  to  use  it  (just  watch  videos  on  YouTube if  your  confused) great  product  makes  your  nails  look  professional I  recommend  it  to everybody</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get the images to stick to the stamper. I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of polish and different stampers as well and I can&#x27;t get it to work.</li>
    <li> item as described! mom loved it!</li>
    <li> i want plate M63 but this plate is M64 ,if u look closer to the image or enlarge it,it is 64 not 63.so if i search for M63 this is the only one showing up .................</li>
    <li> Much better than the ones that come in the kit. I say this because the surface area is bigger and cover my whole nail bed. The stamps with more than 4 designs are too small for my larger nail.</li>
    <li> Nothing else to say really except they&#x27;re awesome. This one has the houndstooth design on it, so it&#x27;s even more awesome.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this for the houndstooth design, which is really cool.  However, I love the swirl pattern because it gives your nail a \\&quot;faux\\&quot; water marble look!  Pretty nifty!</li>
    <li> Love the houndstooth pattern &amp; the swirly one shown in the bottom left.  The other ones I haven&#x27;t used yet.  I bought it for the houndstooth design, of course - it&#x27;s so hot this year.</li>
    <li> of all my nail stamp plates, this one is my favorite</li>
    <li> Crisp clear image every time.  Konad has wonderful quality plates.  I have yet to be disappointed by any of their nail plates.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy the knock off brands, buy a Konad!  Sure, they&#x27;re a little more expensive but they make a perfect stamp every time.  They are expertly engraved so I&#x27;ve never had a problem getting a perfect stamp every time.  I never have voids or scratches or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I place these on a paper towel (instead of buying a holder) and it keeps the plate from slipping around.  I use old gift cards/credit cards to scrape the top of the plate when applying polish.  I did buy a Konad brand stamper on Amazon and highly recommend it.  I haven&#x27;t ever tried other stampers so I can&#x27;t attest to Konad brand there.</li>
    <li> After buying a pack of off-brand plates, I finally shelled out the cash for the Konad version and now I&#x27;ll never go back.  Superior quality, clean images without imperfections, larger than all the others (though -1 star because they&#x27;re still a little small for my thumb/big toe--I assume it&#x27;s for Asian hands).</li>
    <li> Love these designs and arrived quickly</li>
    <li> Worked as expected. Can me a little difficult on longer nails as my nails are very long but with a little practice and perferect your technique and patitent it&#x27;ll come out very cute and unique!</li>
    <li> Love it! Adds diversity to an ordinary mani. Clean crisp images fill my long nails completely. Like other reviewers I use an old gift card to swipe the plates off - I don&#x27;t want to scratch them up. Looking forward to adding to my collection. :D</li>
    <li> Delivered on time. Great stamping plate to have for some unique designs. I love this particular plate because it has a design on it that reminds me of water marbling. Many people are doing the water marbling on their nails now and one of the designs is a good alternative.</li>
    <li> I really like the plate, stamps nicely onto nail and the designs are very cute!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect addition to my collection!</li>
    <li> I got this for my mother and myself because we love nail art. The plates are a good quality works like it&#x27;s supposed to BUT it may take a little while to get the hang of using them. The designs are just like in the picture and are very pretty on the nails themselves.</li>
    <li> My 2nd Konad plate, fourth manicure learning how to stamp. Not to bad if I may say so myself! Plate has great cut images. Shipped &amp; arrived quickly. Would purchase again. Manicure&#x3D;Brown Espresso by Borghese and stamped Gilty Party by Sally Hansen. Great combo!</li>
