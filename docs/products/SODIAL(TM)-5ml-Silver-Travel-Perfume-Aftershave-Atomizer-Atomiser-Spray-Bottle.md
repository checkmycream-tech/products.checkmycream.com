      <li>otherwise good deal/product</li>
      <li>we started with two, and were so happy with them that we ordered four more</li>

      <li>easy to use and sprays well.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>So I wrote the original review praising this product a bit too soon perhaps.</li>
      <li>It also shipped/arrived relatively quick.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They were shipped quickly and I received them fast.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
      <li>I gave the others to my wife and twin daughters to use with perfume oils purchased while working in the middle east - they all love this sprayer too!</li>
      <li>These little refillable atomozers are great.  </li>
      <li>Even if they were $5 each, they&#x27;d be worth it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;Even if they were $5 each, they&#x27;d be worth it...</li>
      <li>lids could grip more tightly so as not to fall off in a purse, etc, but</li>
      <li>I ordered four based upon S. Craig Caldwell&#x27;s review - his review is right on target!&lt;br</li>
      <li>They actually only make the spray head and the covers to fit on a 5 mL glass vial, which is easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>They are tiny, hold a decent amount of cologne, and spray a nice fine mist very reiliably.  </li>
      <li>a spray!&lt;br /&gt;By the way it shipped really fast!</li>
      <li>It sprays pretty well, so it works as</li>
      <li>/&gt;There is no way you will find a better deal, especially at this price point.</li>
      <li>anyway, when I opened the package I was more than happy with the actual item, the bottle is glass and it wasn&#x27;t broken because it was wrapped in bubble wrap, all of my favorite perfumes are in big spray bottles so this is going to be  a blessing to carry in my purse.</li>
      <li>Tiny, easily refillable, and reliable.</li>
      <li>Whoever designed this is smart.</li>
      <li>Shame really.</li>
      <li>would like it more if they use high quality materials to make the seals, as well as all other parts.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t quite know what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>For a couple of bucks, I received two fantastic little atomizers!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very cute and compact way to store your perfume, however I had a difficult time putting my perfume into the bottle.</li>
      <li>The aluminum case is so thin when it arrived the top and bottom was  dented on both that I received.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Loved it! Can&#x27;t beat the price for the look &amp; purpose. It does take a while to arrive, but come in within the time frame stated! This buy met ALL my expectations and more!!!!</li>
    <li> Keep your fragrance in your purse all day!  Good size and fit for the cap, hope to have this one for a long time!</li>
    <li> I have a small obsession with mini things to go in my mini purse. This perfume atomizer is perfect for spritzing body spray on the go! Tiny, easily refillable, and reliable.</li>
    <li> easy to use and sprays well. It&#x27;s easier to open and put the perfume in.  The atomizer worked so well I purchased 3 more.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Got these for my girlfriend to put some small non-spray perfumes in.  Even if they were $5 each, they&#x27;d be worth it.  The silvery sleeve is actually aluminum, not plastic, and the inner vial that holds the actual perfume is glass, not plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was SHOCKED at the high quality for the price...we started with two, and were so happy with them that we ordered four more I also had some men&#x27;s colognes that weren&#x27;t in sprays, so I never used them...now that they&#x27;re easy to spray, they&#x27;re getting used!</li>
    <li> So leaky. I had to make a rubber ring to prevent the leakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever you put in this thing, if it is liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to find a way to block the leakage by your self.</li>
    <li> It took 28 days for this item to arrive, which is a little slower than usual (even from China!) anyway, when I opened the package I was more than happy with the actual item, the bottle is glass and it wasn&#x27;t broken because it was wrapped in bubble wrap, all of my favorite perfumes are in big spray bottles so this is going to be  a blessing to carry in my purse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought several different spray bottles for lab tests. This one is the best. Whoever designed this is smart. They actually only make the spray head and the covers to fit on a 5 mL glass vial, which is easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;The problem is this product seems still under deverlopment. I bought 6 bottles, however, the seal parts are different in shapes and materials.&lt;br /&gt;I would like it more if they use high quality materials to make the seals, as well as all other parts.</li>
    <li> I ordered four based upon S. Craig Caldwell&#x27;s review - his review is right on target!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Even if they were $5 each, they&#x27;d be worth it... I also had some men&#x27;s colognes that weren&#x27;t in sprays, so I never used them...now that they&#x27;re easy to spray, they&#x27;re getting used!&amp;#34; (S. Craig Caldwell, Feb. 1, 2013, Amazon Review entitled &#x27;AWESOME!! Great quality, sprays great!&#x27;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use one for my non-spray colognes and it works like a champ.  I gave the others to my wife and twin daughters to use with perfume oils purchased while working in the middle east - they all love this sprayer too!</li>
    <li> As others have already written, it takes a few weeks to get this product.  One (out of four) was also slightly bent.  Nevertheless, the value is great and it works well.</li>
    <li> WORKS FOR ME AND THE PRODUCT ARRIVED A LOT SOONER THAN I WAS TOLD THAT IT WOULD GET HERE...IM HAPPY</li>
    <li> The aluminum case is so thin when it arrived the top and bottom was  dented on both that I received.</li>
    <li> Might be a great product, but without any instructions on how to fill them, I don&#x27;t really know.  I guess I just assumed that there would be some form of instruction - but it was just the bottles in an envelope... That&#x27;s all you get:(</li>
    <li> great for the price...lids could grip more tightly so as not to fall off in a purse, etc, but otherwise good deal/product</li>
    <li> For a couple of bucks, I received two fantastic little atomizers!  They are tiny, hold a decent amount of cologne, and spray a nice fine mist very reiliably.  I&#x27;m not sure about the complaints here regarding the metal bottom &amp;#34;sliding off.&amp;#34;  It doesn&#x27;t just slide off by itself, you have to PULL it off.  I&#x27;m glad the metal base comes off so I can see the level of cologne when I&#x27;m re-filling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no way you will find a better deal, especially at this price point.</li>
    <li> it is a little to small, really small, mabe have to refill every 2 days, can be very inconvenient. the out cloth of this spray is a little to fragile.  It sprays pretty well, so it works as a spray!&lt;br /&gt;By the way it shipped really fast! 20 days earlier than estimated</li>
    <li> These little refillable atomozers are great.  You can fit them in your purse or pocketr and  so nice for travel.&lt;br /&gt;They were shipped quickly and I received them fast.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very cute and compact way to store your perfume, however I had a difficult time putting my perfume into the bottle.</li>
    <li> Needed something so I can put my cologne in my 3.4 oz. bottles into a small traveler sprayer that wouldn&#x27;t leak. So far so good. used it all last week and didn&#x27;t leak and sprayer works well. It also shipped/arrived relatively quick.</li>
    <li> Got the job done. The actuation seems to be deteriorating after a few weeks of use, but, I think I paid a buck for it so it isn&#x27;t like I have any room to complain.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t quite know what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. The size is perfect for travel. The price was great too. Delivery was quicker than anticipated.</li>
    <li> So I wrote the original review praising this product a bit too soon perhaps. I recently took the diffuser with me on a trip to Europe, it was in my carryon luggage. When I arrived at my destination and unpacked I could smell my cologne. The Difuser had leaked and spilt all over the other items in my TSA approved plastic bag. I just tossed it. For the money it&#x27;s a great deal but if it leaks it&#x27;s not worth it. Shame really.</li>
