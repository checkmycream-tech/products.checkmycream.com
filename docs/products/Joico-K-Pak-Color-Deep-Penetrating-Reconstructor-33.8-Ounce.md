      <li>Smells good and leaves hair amazing!</li>
      <li>I use this conditioner about every 2 weeks to keep my hair well-conditioned and healthy!</li>
      <li>This is a really good Reconstructor, my hair is doing so much better now.</li>
      <li>Best hair product I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
      <li>This explains why the price is to good to be true.</li>
      <li>Conditions hair better than products at twice the price.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my hair healthy.</li>
      <li>what, but as others have said, it does feel more watery and this did have a funky smell to it.</li>
      <li>My hairdresser used the real version of this product in my hair at the salon and my hair felt so good as a result.</li>
      <li>so I can have beautiful hair again, or maybe I will try from a different seller.</li>
      <li>The price really is too good to be true.</li>
      <li>It smells so good and makes my hair so soft!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, the real version of this product is great for highlighted and damaged hair, but Amazon is not selling the real product.</li>
      <li>Great product for dry, permed or colored hair.</li>
      <li>I love it, and it is a staple in my house, much like flour and butter.</li>
      <li>good deep penetrating conditioner.</li>
      <li>And yes, this particular bottle did have a more watery consistency....</li>
      <li>I have straight fine hair and dont notice it making my hair greasy.</li>
      <li>I had to use it daily for about a week to get the effect but amazing product.</li>
      <li>After majorly bleaching my hair this is bringing it back to a great texture.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as good as the Intense Hydrator, apparently, but it does a lot to help the process along for really damaged hair.</li>
      <li>Hours after my hair has been dry, I can still smell the rich, floral coconut of the authentic product in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had colored it too many times in a short time period because the first one didn&#x27;t take right.  </li>
      <li>Hair looks and feels shiny and healthy especially after straightening hair.</li>
      <li>one of my favourite joico products, absolutely love this product, i use mine once a week following my colour treatment, and i would leave it on for approx 5 hours, when i wash this off</li>
      <li>out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to make sure that my suspicions about this product&#x27;s authenticity were correct, I went to Ulta and bought the real version (paying a lot for a smaller bottle).</li>
      <li>This works great for our entire family even though we all have very long hair (thigh length and longer) and different hair types (anywhere from soft curls to ultra-straight hair, extremely full heads of hair to thinning, mid to fine diameters).  </li>
      <li>This product smells almost like the original, real product, but doesn&#x27;t last in my hair after I get out of the shower.</li>
      <li>This cotains more keratin than any other product i could find ...</li>
      <li>The consististy in this product and the one that I know of are not the same this one seems more watered down when the real one is not.</li>
      <li>The real version from Ulta was a little thicker and the smell was more present.</li>
      <li>You know what I&#x27;m talking about, they feel super dry, they&#x27;re all coarse, and jagged looking, and I slapped some of this on them and now they feel and look like normal hair.</li>
      <li>This product took my hair that was almost like gum and hard and crunchy to smooth and soft so that it feels like real hair again.</li>
      <li>product is old smells like rotten bananas.</li>
      <li>The Ulta version made my hair feel soft again.</li>
      <li>But my hair feels amazingly soft</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s apparently step like 99 into 100,000 in this product line.</li>
      <li>Just a Hawaiian smell, and this had a weird chemical smell to it that I can only describe as kind of burnt maybe?</li>

    <li> I love this protein conditioner and have been using it for two years with that being said I knowthis is a FAKE  JOICO PRODUCT. The consististy in this product and the one that I know of are not the same this one seems more watered down when the real one is not. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS BUYER. GO TO LOCBEAUTY and do so. This explains why the price is to good to be true.</li>
    <li> excellent product I will be placing another order soon.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner on the planet. Conditions without weighing down adds volume and definitely improves hair over time. Smells great!</li>

    <li> The product itself is great. The problem is that this seller is selling a fake version of the real product. The price really is too good to be true. I saw that others had the same trouble with receiving fake product. My hairdresser recommended this to me, so I jumped when I saw the price. My hairdresser used the real version of this product in my hair at the salon and my hair felt so good as a result. When I tried this at home, however, my hair felt worse. Instead of soft, it felt rough and my ends were absolutely dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to make sure that my suspicions about this product&#x27;s authenticity were correct, I went to Ulta and bought the real version (paying a lot for a smaller bottle). The Ulta version made my hair feel soft again. The differences between this product and the version I bought from Ulta are that this version feels thinner and seems watered down, melting away in my hand. The real version from Ulta was a little thicker and the smell was more present. This product smells almost like the original, real product, but doesn&#x27;t last in my hair after I get out of the shower. Hours after my hair has been dry, I can still smell the rich, floral coconut of the authentic product in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the real version of this product is great for highlighted and damaged hair, but Amazon is not selling the real product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. Keeps my hair healthy. Sometimes I even put it on my hair dry and use it as a deep conditioning mask. I have straight fine hair and dont notice it making my hair greasy.</li>
    <li> one of my favourite joico products, absolutely love this product, i use mine once a week following my colour treatment, and i would leave it on for approx 5 hours, when i wash this off OMG my hair feels like silk... i also use joico kpak shampoo and conditioner, would never change products, and the price was incredible !!! i will def be stocking up on this on so i never run out !!!</li>
    <li> product is old smells like rotten bananas. would like to get my money back</li>
    <li> This product SAVED my hair. I had colored it too many times in a short time period because the first one didn&#x27;t take right.  This product took my hair that was almost like gum and hard and crunchy to smooth and soft so that it feels like real hair again. I had to use it daily for about a week to get the effect but amazing product.</li>
    <li> Conditions hair better than products at twice the price.  Use it daily or do a deep condition (leave it on over night and rinse in the a.m.).  Smells good and leaves hair amazing!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Hair looks and feels shiny and healthy especially after straightening hair. Best hair product I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
    <li> My hair had very bad heat damage. I used this product and it made my hair stronger, with time. My curl definition came back as well... of course it all depends on how damaged your hair is, but patience is key! The product is a very loose cream, so you&#x27;ll get even distribution... It&#x27;s pricey but I got all my curls back.... Beautiful...I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> I used this stuff a long time ago and it did wonders for my hair. I&#x27;ve been trying to get my hair back to a healthier state so i decided to try it again. So heres how i feel about this product. I don&#x27;t know if Joico changed their formula or what, but as others have said, it does feel more watery and this did have a funky smell to it. I know what this stuff use to smell like, it smelled like coconuts, pineapples, the beach. Just a Hawaiian smell, and this had a weird chemical smell to it that I can only describe as kind of burnt maybe? I don&#x27;t know it was weird. And yes, this particular bottle did have a more watery consistency....BUT I still used it on my hair and my hair does feel softer. The day I bought this, I had some hairs on my bangs that were out of control. You know what I&#x27;m talking about, they feel super dry, they&#x27;re all coarse, and jagged looking, and I slapped some of this on them and now they feel and look like normal hair. So am I disappointed about the consistency and the smell? Yes. I am. But my hair feels amazingly soft so I guess if the formula has changed I will just have to deal with in so I can have beautiful hair again, or maybe I will try from a different seller.</li>
    <li> I use this conditioner about every 2 weeks to keep my hair well-conditioned and healthy! It smells so good and makes my hair so soft!</li>
    <li> So, I bought this on accident for my girlfriend. She kept it bc it&#x27;s apparently step like 99 into 100,000 in this product line. It&#x27;s not as good as the Intense Hydrator, apparently, but it does a lot to help the process along for really damaged hair.</li>
    <li> Better and less expensive then Redken.</li>
    <li> good deep penetrating conditioner. Use twice a week</li>
    <li> After majorly bleaching my hair this is bringing it back to a great texture.</li>
    <li> This is a really good Reconstructor, my hair is doing so much better now.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Strengthens hair and smells like bananas.  Can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> Great product for dry, permed or colored hair.</li>
    <li> I have 25 years of hair on my head, it&#x27;s thick, coarse, and it reaches my thighs.  I swim in a chlorinated pool.  This product saves me from thousand dollars of treatments a year, and a zillion split ends. I love it, and it is a staple in my house, much like flour and butter.</li>
    <li> Totally awesome product !!!!</li>
    <li> You can see results in only one app! PERFECT!</li>
    <li> Returned this product!  I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it did not work as the same product purchased at beauty stores.</li>
    <li> Revives over processed straw like hair to silky curls my husband can&#x27;t keep his hands off of!</li>
    <li> Excellent product; outstanding delivery time.</li>
    <li> This works great for our entire family even though we all have very long hair (thigh length and longer) and different hair types (anywhere from soft curls to ultra-straight hair, extremely full heads of hair to thinning, mid to fine diameters).  Joico K-Pak is one of only two conditioners that we use regularly.  Great stuff!</li>
