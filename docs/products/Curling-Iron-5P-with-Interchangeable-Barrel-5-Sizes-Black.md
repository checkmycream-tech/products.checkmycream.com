      <li>But I&#x27;m ok with it.</li>
      <li>I love the way that it heats up.</li>
      <li>️ Love it</li>
      <li>so I think it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>and i hope to use this product forever :)</li>
      <li>maybe others have gotten better products.</li>
      <li>Love how it is clipless and it keeps the curls all day.</li>
      <li>Love this product so easy to use</li>
      <li>It was easy to use and I recommend this curler.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to put together.</li>

      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants nice curls and can retained the heat well and evenly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
      <li>So easy to use ; the curls come out so cute &amp; the glove really helps  </li>
      <li>I am a mother and wanted to get something special for myself</li>
      <li>all in all i would say its a good set i only rated it with 4 stars bcus</li>
      <li>I got it fairly quick.</li>
      <li>She has hours of fun curling everyone&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>I just opened the box, look at it and call Amazon right away and request a refund.</li>
      <li>Barrel&#x27;s are hard to get off, but i think that&#x27;s a good thing because it means it&#x27;s not going to fall off easily as I&#x27;m curling.</li>
      <li>I am a cosmetologist and was excited to had the versatility of the multiple barrel sizes, but the plastic attachment clip was cheap plastic and broke.</li>
      <li>i mostly use it on myself and its a little hard to wear a glove the hole time, but it does the job and curls great!</li>
      <li>I am a first time curling wand buyer.</li>
      <li>love it, now i can curl my hair in different ways.</li>
      <li>I will suggest buying a heat glove to protect yourself when using any hot styling tools.</li>
      <li>i love the different sizes, ive used this on my sisters and it works really well!  </li>
      <li>Curls hold very well love that you can also makes waves with the bigger barrel.</li>
      <li>Better off buying the single barrel version.</li>
      <li>I really expected a much better product.  </li>
      <li>For a curling wand that cost so much money</li>
      <li>it had so much promise.</li>
      <li>Heats up fast.</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m out 60.00 very dissappointed.</li>
      <li>it looked brand new, its my first time owning a curling iron set like this one,</li>
      <li>Definately worth the money the 5 different sizes that change out</li>
      <li>I received only a 3 rod curling set, and right before Christmas, at that.</li>
      <li>last night was my first time using</li>
      <li>My hair is completely fried.</li>
      <li>Older model (not same as picture) came.</li>
      <li>and i have NO Regrets when it comes to the efficiency of this product.  </li>
      <li>I have no regrets</li>

<li> I have no regrets</li>
<li> You can also create a wave pattern by not holding your hair on the wand as long.</li>
<li> The barrels are hard to change once put on the base but other than that it is perfect</li>
<li> All other irons make my hair frizzy and the curls don&#x27;t last.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little different than your typical curling iron, but there are several YouTube videos on how to use this curling wand.</li>
<li> (obviously the curls will not be as tight as it was as the days goes by).  </li>
<li> I returned it after only a few days</li>
<li> Also the quality is very low, hard to get the barrels in place and the system to secure them looks very weak and that it will break after a few times you use it.</li>
<li> Not worth the money.</li>
<li> The barrels here really hard to change.  </li>
<li> It is hard to use.</li>
<li> I am a professional stylist and have never had a tool, that even with the heat settings adjusted to a lower temperature, that burned my hair so bad after one use.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried everything even the automatic curler that sucks your hair in and spits out a curl.</li>
<li> I mean one use.  </li>
<li> so I was really sad when this turned out to be such a bad product.  </li>
<li> i received it and unfortunately had to return it.</li>
<li> I am disappointed in the product because it does not have a clip to hold the hair and so makes it difficult to use.  </li>
<li> My sister is going to be so disappointed.</li>
<li> I am very unhappy and unsatisfied with the item.</li>
<li> This is a piece of crap.</li>
<li> This is horrible.</li>

    <li> Awesome product ❤️ Love it</li>
    <li> Inaccurate description. I received only a 3 rod curling set, and right before Christmas, at that. This is horrible. My sister is going to be so disappointed.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter. My daughter loves this wand.</li>
    <li> Best curling iorn ive ever used!! Definately worth the money the 5 different sizes that change out make variaion and styles turn out differerently. Love how it is clipless and it keeps the curls all day. BUY THIS NOW!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product!.  I got it at Tjmaxx for a fraction of the price it&#x27;s being sold for on Amazon ($59.99) and i have NO Regrets when it comes to the efficiency of this product.  It&#x27;s very easy to use, the curls stay in all day and even for days depending on the barrel you use (obviously the curls will not be as tight as it was as the days goes by).  I will suggest buying a heat glove to protect yourself when using any hot styling tools. I have no regrets and i hope to use this product forever :)</li>
    <li> Love this product so easy to use</li>
    <li> It is hard to use. I gave it to my daughter after spending several evenings burning myself! Not for me!</li>
    <li> best hair curler ever!!!</li>
    <li> While I found myself returning the item because it was getting too hot for my hair type, I did see that it did curl the hair very nicely. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants nice curls and can retained the heat well and evenly.</li>
    <li> i read reviews and felt it wasn&#x27;t given the chance. i received it and unfortunately had to return it. it feels flimsy when you change the barrels and i didn&#x27;t want to risk breaking it. it had so much promise. maybe others have gotten better products.</li>
    <li> So easy to use ; the curls come out so cute &amp; the glove really helps  - I&#x27;m totally in love !!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST ever curling iron a girl could dream of. I&#x27;ve tried everything even the automatic curler that sucks your hair in and spits out a curl. This thing makes EVERY perfect imaginable curl AND leaves my hair silky. How does that happen? Idk. But I&#x27;m ok with it. All other irons make my hair frizzy and the curls don&#x27;t last. But this guy. He makes my curls last two days and my hair has no frizz at all. It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> i love the different sizes, ive used this on my sisters and it works really well!  i kind of wish there was a tip at the end for protection but its just something to get used to.  it came with a protective glove but i dont ever use it because i cant keep a grip on the hair with it.  i mostly use it on myself and its a little hard to wear a glove the hole time, but it does the job and curls great!</li>
    <li> No complaints! Barrel&#x27;s are hard to get off, but i think that&#x27;s a good thing because it means it&#x27;s not going to fall off easily as I&#x27;m curling. Heats up fast.</li>
    <li> This is a great tool for those that don&#x27;t curl their hair often. gives a variety of options. product does a great job</li>
    <li> Love it and recommend!!!</li>
    <li> This is a piece of crap. Beware of the add, the seller is misleading you!!! It says that it is a 5 piece, and the pictures shows 5 barrels, but when I got it it only had three barrels. Also the quality is very low, hard to get the barrels in place and the system to secure them looks very weak and that it will break after a few times you use it. I just opened the box, look at it and call Amazon right away and request a refund.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a gift so I think it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> it shipped to me fast which made me happy &amp; when i opened it,  it looked brand new, its my first time owning a curling iron set like this one, last night was my first time using i fell asleep with my curls &amp; woke up still with my curls on which was a good thing. all in all i would say its a good set i only rated it with 4 stars bcus i havent used all of the barrel sizes &amp; have only used it once.</li>
    <li> Absolutely Amazing! I love the way that it heats up. I am a first time curling wand buyer. I got it fairly quick. It&#x27;s easy to put together. It&#x27;s easy to control the heat. It heats up very quick! It was easy to use and I recommend this curler.</li>
    <li> Older model (not same as picture) came. not to mention the iron is all scrached and dented. I am very unhappy and unsatisfied with the item.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron, came with the glove,5 barrels and that nice box. Curls hold very well love that you can also makes waves with the bigger barrel. If you buy this one you never need to buy another one again! Don&#x27;t hesitate just buy it. I had International shipping without troubles. Bought it in June and it still works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Got my girlfriend to do her hair up more often; therefore priceless.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. Better off buying the single barrel version. The clip that holds the different attachment barrels broke the second time I used it. Had read some good reviews about the product so decided to purchase. I am a cosmetologist and was excited to had the versatility of the multiple barrel sizes, but the plastic attachment clip was cheap plastic and broke. Now I&#x27;m out 60.00 very dissappointed.</li>
    <li> This was a terriable product.  The barrels here really hard to change.  I had to get my husband to switch them out for me and I am very strong.  The smallest barrel broke after one use.  I mean one use.  For a curling wand that cost so much money I really expected a much better product.  I am a mother and wanted to get something special for myself so I was really sad when this turned out to be such a bad product.  I returned it after only a few days</li>
    <li> My daughter loves all the different sizes of curls she can make with one curling iron.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed in the product because it does not have a clip to hold the hair and so makes it difficult to use.  I would like to return the product and get one that has a clip.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little different than your typical curling iron, but there are several YouTube videos on how to use this curling wand. Your curls will be fabulous!!! You can also create a wave pattern by not holding your hair on the wand as long. This is a great product and I recommend you buy this but dont forget the Tresemme heat control spray. That will help prevent heat damage. Enjoy!!!!</li>
    <li> Works amazing! The barrels are hard to change once put on the base but other than that it is perfect</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter! She has hours of fun curling everyone&#x27;s hair. Great investment.</li>
    <li> love it, now i can curl my hair in different ways. and don&#x27;t have to learn how to use a regular curling iron.</li>
    <li> Not recommended if you are trying to maintain the integrity of your hair. I am a professional stylist and have never had a tool, that even with the heat settings adjusted to a lower temperature, that burned my hair so bad after one use. My hair is completely fried. I use heat protective products and treat my hair weekly, this shouldn&#x27;t be happening from one use on a 300 degree setting.</li>
    <li> I know my wife is in love with this curling iron. Something about the features and sizes, I have no idea what this actually does. I do know that it made her Christmas!</li>
    <li> Having this on my bathroom sink and available for use is the best thing ever no extra space is required for different irons</li>
