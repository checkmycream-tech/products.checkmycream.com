    <li> i received the cologne today and was so excited to give it to my hubby to try it.. the scent is magical.. Very subtle but manly...&lt;br /&gt;my only concern is that it arrived without a sealed plastic cover like when you buy in dept store. But i can live with it.. Thanks for fast shipping. We are currently onboard a cruise ship and the delivery was relatively fast. Good job!</li>
    <li> I give five starts only because I really love this perfume, but sadly I bought this but the box broke and all good smell gone.Amazon refunded this but It&#x27;s really a pity.</li>

    <li> The bottle says &#x27;made in france&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;The original was &#x27;made in USA&#x27;</li>
