      <li>It works great!  </li>
      <li>it holds all the hairs in place perfectly</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Great product; will purchase again.</li>
      <li>It takes all of 5 seconds to run the mascara-like wand through my brows, and voila: beautifully groomed and tidy brows.</li>
      <li>Not quite as good and doubt I will purchase again.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with the product.  </li>
      <li>Love it and it looks amazing and stays on all day.</li>
      <li>I love everything about this product.</li>
      <li>I LOVE \\&quot;styling\\</li>
      <li>Really love this eye brow gel</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t use anything else because nothing is better.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Shipping was right on time and packaged good as well.</li>
      <li>It works great to style your eyebrows and with clear gel</li>
      <li>, I thought, \\&quot;This would be 100% perfect if my right eyebrow wasn&#x27;t making me look a TINY bit evil....\\&quot;.   </li>
      <li>It works fine.  </li>
      <li>I thought this might be good when I applied it, but it didn&#x27;t last more than a couple of hours.</li>
      <li>So this isn&#x27;t as good as Anastasia Beverly Hills, that stuff doesn&#x27;t move, but for the price this is a close second place.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m a redhead so the clear gel was good, even on my very light-color brows.)  </li>
      <li>I had been looking all over NYC for any brand of styling gel for eyebrows but the only one I found was more than $25!  </li>
      <li>but so, so worth it.</li>
      <li>what it&#x27;s worth, the Tweezerman tweezers ([[ASIN:B000EMUDUQ</li>
      <li>The applicator holds just the right amount of brow gel.</li>
      <li>I am cursed/blessed (depending on who you ask) with full, dark brown eyebrows that seem to have a mind of their own.</li>
      <li>I got so annoyed when someone took pretty much the perfect close up picture of me and my family and upon looking very closely</li>
      <li>It never fails to keep my brows in line and in style.</li>
      <li>My brows stay right where I want them pretty much all day.</li>
      <li>It should work like a mascara wand, where the whole brush comes out with the gel on it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased eyebrow styling gels before that are too much.  </li>
      <li>This is an absolute MUST HAVE in my makeup bag.</li>
      <li>I stumbled on this product and figured I&#x27;d give it a try since it was reasonably priced.  </li>
      <li>They go fast.  </li>
      <li>Prefer the clear gel, blends right in and no problem with color variations.</li>
      <li>This one dispenses just the right amount and looks natural while giving you a finished look.</li>
      <li>I have tried other bands but this clear gel is easy, it works, and is affordable.</li>
      <li>&quot; my eyebrows and them staying put :) They&#x27;re pretty thin, so it doesn&#x27;t take much, so this should last forever.</li>
      <li>Stainless Steel Slant Tweezer, Pink]]) are my absolute, can&#x27;t-live-without beauty product.</li>
      <li>This one doesn&#x27;t, only the very tip does.  </li>
      <li>It is great for casual wear and won&#x27;t move as long as you don&#x27;t touch your face.</li>
      <li>Worked as expected, have used previously and always satisfied.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, so you can barely feel it--but it does make a difference.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Was hoping to find a less-expensive replacement for my other more expensive brow gel, but just didn&#x27;t hold up (and didn&#x27;t seem like there was much product in the tube).  </li>

<li> I only wish I&#x27;d discovered it years ago, back when I was doing the &#x27;hairspray-on-my-finger-tip&#x27; method of brow control, which makes for not only sticky fingers but also the inevitable flakey bits, which... not a good look.</li>
<li> Back to the other product!</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to get cloudy like the other brands.  </li>
<li> not exactly a brow gel connoisseur, but</li>
<li> You can shape your eyebrows without the stiffness of some other gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> By the way, it&#x27;s not really a \\&quot;mousse,\\&quot; in my opinion, but rather a clear thin gel.</li>
<li> (lest I end up looking like a female version of Martin Scorsese, at least brow-wise).</li>
<li> I like it, but it could be a little stronger hold.</li>
<li> So, because I&#x27;m addicted to trying different beauty products</li>
<li> and it doesnt make the hair hard.</li>
<li> If left unkempt, I would have crazy brows.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tweezed the daylights out of my poor brows in the past, but now I&#x27;m trying to embrace natural-looking eyebrows.</li>
<li> Tried this as a less expensive alternative to Anastasia&#x27;s.</li>
<li> They&#x27;re expensive</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it and it looks amazing and stays on all day. I run a lot and wear this and it doesnt smudge one tiny bit.</li>
    <li> Worked as expected, have used previously and always satisfied. Prefer the clear gel, blends right in and no problem with color variations. Great product; will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I had been looking all over NYC for any brand of styling gel for eyebrows but the only one I found was more than $25!  I stumbled on this product and figured I&#x27;d give it a try since it was reasonably priced.  I was very pleased with the product.  It works great to style your eyebrows and with clear gel it doesn&#x27;t matter what color your eyebrows are, it will work for you. (I&#x27;m a redhead so the clear gel was good, even on my very light-color brows.)  I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I got so annoyed when someone took pretty much the perfect close up picture of me and my family and upon looking very closely, I thought, \\&quot;This would be 100% perfect if my right eyebrow wasn&#x27;t making me look a TINY bit evil....\\&quot;.   So, because I&#x27;m addicted to trying different beauty products and I&#x27;ve never tried eyebrow gel, I found this. It&#x27;s awesome! I LOVE \\&quot;styling\\&quot; my eyebrows and them staying put :) They&#x27;re pretty thin, so it doesn&#x27;t take much, so this should last forever.</li>
    <li> It should work like a mascara wand, where the whole brush comes out with the gel on it.  This one doesn&#x27;t, only the very tip does.  So you have to keep dipping the wand in the tube and applying and spreading several times.  It&#x27;s a pain to deal with, won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> great product i use it all the time! no clumps or white residue and it doesnt make the hair hard.</li>
    <li> I like it, but it could be a little stronger hold.</li>
    <li> I use this every day. You can shape your eyebrows without the stiffness of some other gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not exactly a brow gel connoisseur, but I prefer this product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to get cloudy like the other brands.  They go fast.  Wish they were cheaper.</li>
    <li> Really love this eye brow gel it holds all the hairs in place perfectly i would definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Tames those stubborn hairs.  Great product!</li>
    <li> compares to the more expensive brands I used to buy, does not leave white flakes but the hold could be stronger.</li>
    <li> I have sparse eyebrows and after I pencil them in I always apply this gel to keep them looking groomed longer.  It works great!  Shipping was right on time and packaged good as well.</li>
    <li> I was constantly struggling with my eyebrows throughout the day, then I bought this stuff based in Amazon&#x27;s reviews. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. My brows stay right where I want them pretty much all day.</li>
    <li> Was hoping to find a less-expensive replacement for my other more expensive brow gel, but just didn&#x27;t hold up (and didn&#x27;t seem like there was much product in the tube).  Back to the other product!</li>
    <li> Tried this as a less expensive alternative to Anastasia&#x27;s. Not quite as good and doubt I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> It works fine.  I find myself not using it cuz I never have time.</li>
    <li> I have use this brow gel for decades. It never fails to keep my brows in line and in style.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased eyebrow styling gels before that are too much.  This one dispenses just the right amount and looks natural while giving you a finished look.</li>
    <li> Love it. I have tried other bands but this clear gel is easy, it works, and is affordable. Done. Would buy again</li>
    <li> If left unkempt, I would have crazy brows. I&#x27;ve tweezed the daylights out of my poor brows in the past, but now I&#x27;m trying to embrace natural-looking eyebrows. This product is perfect for taming them. It&#x27;s lightweight, so you can barely feel it--but it does make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth, the Tweezerman tweezers ([[ASIN:B000EMUDUQ Tweezerman  Stainless Steel Slant Tweezer, Pink]]) are my absolute, can&#x27;t-live-without beauty product. They&#x27;re expensive but so, so worth it. So those, paired with the brow mousse, work wonders on unruly brows!</li>
    <li> I am cursed/blessed (depending on who you ask) with full, dark brown eyebrows that seem to have a mind of their own. I don&#x27;t need to pencil or shadow them in, but I do require something to hold them in place (lest I end up looking like a female version of Martin Scorsese, at least brow-wise). This stuff is A-mazing! I only wish I&#x27;d discovered it years ago, back when I was doing the &#x27;hairspray-on-my-finger-tip&#x27; method of brow control, which makes for not only sticky fingers but also the inevitable flakey bits, which... not a good look. The applicator holds just the right amount of brow gel. By the way, it&#x27;s not really a \\&quot;mousse,\\&quot; in my opinion, but rather a clear thin gel. It takes all of 5 seconds to run the mascara-like wand through my brows, and voila: beautifully groomed and tidy brows. No flaky business or crusty residue, and my otherwise unruly brow hairs stay neatly in place ALL DAY. I love everything about this product. I&#x27;ve repurchased numerous times over the years. I won&#x27;t use anything else because nothing is better. Used daily, one tube generally lasts me half a year (give or take). This is an absolute MUST HAVE in my makeup bag. Even on my no-makeup days, I still use this to look put together enough to be seen out in public. Love it.</li>
    <li> So this isn&#x27;t as good as Anastasia Beverly Hills, that stuff doesn&#x27;t move, but for the price this is a close second place. It is great for casual wear and won&#x27;t move as long as you don&#x27;t touch your face.</li>
    <li> I thought this might be good when I applied it, but it didn&#x27;t last more than a couple of hours. Guess I&#x27;m stuck with a more expensive product. Drat!</li>
