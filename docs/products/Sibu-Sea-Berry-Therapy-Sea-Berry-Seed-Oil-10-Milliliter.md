<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I like the berry oil better...</li>
    <li> My family members ,I was amazed at how much better my sun damage and age spots on my chest ,arms and legs&lt;br /&gt;Looked .it took years off my skin .,and at 70 plus that is not easy to do .please do not stop selling this product .&lt;br /&gt;Use this with the soap and your shower is a great beauty treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Julia S</li>
    <li> Works wonders for wrinkles on your face and any sun damage!</li>
    <li> The product delivers better results than promised.  It really helped with my rosacea symptoms and with small breakouts.  The smell is a little off putting but it doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
    <li> This did not helped with my mild rosacea but it does moisturize my skin. It&#x27;s true that this oil has healing properties. I applied this on my wound and it healed faster.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for a week, but I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell and how oily it was.  From the reviews I read here, I thought it would absorb nicely into my skin (I have pretty dry skin).  I only applied 2 drops of this to my entire face.  Within 30 minutes, my whole face was shiny.  I use mineral makeup and even after waiting 10 minutes for this to absorb it still made my makeup brushes all greasy and stinky.  I ended up throwing out 3 of my favorite brushes because I couldn&#x27;t get the smell out.  I have had much better luck with good old fashioned coconut oil and also the Yes to Tomatoes moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil to apply to acne spots and noticed that after a night of sleeping with spot treatment, the acne was noticeable diminished.  It didn&#x27;t seem as red or swollen.  The oil does have a weird smell, but I didn&#x27;t find it bothersome, although my husband said I smelled like top ramen.  I will definitely keep using it on my skin along with grape seed oil.</li>
    <li> Really good for acne scars especially adult acne i just finished an accutane course and the pimples were healing alot slower vut this really helped with the healing</li>
    <li> This oil does seem to reduce the redness of rosacea; however,  the smell is so bad.  I don&#x27;t know how these other users spread it all over their face and then go to bed and sleep all night. It smells very much like cod liver oil to me.  Very fishy!  I&#x27;ve used both this oil and tea tree oil for various skin ailments.  At first, I thought that the tea tree oil was too overpowering, but compared to this oil, it smells great. I just don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be able to continue using the oil unless scientists come up with a way to de-odorize it.</li>
    <li> I am a skincare Therapist and this product is really good for reducing inflammation and great for hydrating sensitive skin and reducing redness for people with rosacea.I always recommend this for when my clients are having dermatitis or other skin issues.</li>
    <li> I broke out in little pustulent bumps within a day or two; in addition, it made my acne even worse! I don&#x27;t like it at all!</li>
    <li> This oil has been a miracle for my Rosacea. I apply a thin layer on my face before bedtime and also under my makeup every day. I no longer have any rash or bumps on my face. My face is much less red than it was also. Don&#x27;t confuse this seed oil with the sea buckthorn berry oil. The sea buckthorn SEED oil is the one that works on the Rosacea.</li>
    <li> 4th day after receiving and using, opened up the bottle and saw gross looking stringy black material in bottle and dropper.  Dropped some of the black tinged oil on my palm.  The black material did not immediately dissipate into the orange oil.  Ick. I am returning and will buy another brand next time.</li>
    <li> Clears dark spots on face&lt;br /&gt;Not oily clears mole like spots&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply right on spots not oily use every night</li>
    <li> My skin loves this, but it has a strong &#x27;earthy&#x27; smell.  Which gets in your clothes.  Very &#x27;natural&#x27;.  I cant decide if it is worth it.  Beauty isn&#x27;t easy!</li>
    <li> I know it seems strange to combat oil with oil, but this product has really helped my blemish prone skin stay clear and supple. I haven&#x27;t had any big breakouts since using this product. It takes a few minutes to absorb into skin. I use a few drops right after I wash my face and then apply a moisturizer ( alpha hydroxy). This combination has kept my skin clear and me, Happy!!</li>
    <li> Glad they lowered the price.....Sea Buckthorn Seed Oil......the new big thing will see if it&#x27;s as good as they say....I write more in another review!~</li>
    <li> First off, let me start by saying that I don&#x27;t suffer from horrible acne.  I get the occasional breakout and I do get a cystic acne breakout two to three times a year.  This is the best treatment I have ever used.  It really clears up my acne in a fraction of the time that most treatments do.  I can actually have a very angry, irritated blemish and if I put this on a few times that day and then at night before bed, the blemish will be very flat and almost healed.  I love it.  I was skeptical at first about putting an oil on my face.  But I have very dry skin so maybe it&#x27;s a combo of that and the fact that this is a healing oil that makes it work for me.  I will always stay stocked up in this.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about this product, but I am very happy. I gave it a try.  I received it on Tuesday morning and used it Tuesday night, Wednesday morning and Wednesday night. It is now Thursday morning and my skin looks significantly better. I have breakouts and scarring from acne on both sides of my chin. As of this morning, that area is almost completely breakout free and the one breakout that remains is very small. The other benefit is that the scarring has already faded quite a bit. My entire skin tone im that area looks much clearer and even.    I also ordered the Aubrey sea buckthorn face wash and cucumber toner and began using them, along with the oil, on Wednesday. I got them bc I wasn&#x27;t happy with my current face wash anyway, and figured the extra sea buckthorn couldn&#x27;t hurt.    I have not been using moisutrizer with this, and using the oil in it&#x27;s place. The oil absorbs pretty quickly, but leaves a bit of a residue on my face. However, nothing has come off on my pillows and you cant see it on my face.   I would definitely suggest this to anyone who suffers from breakouts and/or acne scarring. It pleasantly shocked me with it&#x27;s fast working benefits!</li>
    <li> I use this product to help repair the cuticles on my fingers and moisturize my nails.  It works great.  You would think an oil based product would be greasy but once this product gets absorbed into your skin it is just very smooth and there is no greasy feeling.  I love it.  It has a woodsy smell which reminds me that this is a natural product.</li>
    <li> I am amazed at how effective Sea Buckthorn Oil is in the treatment of Rosacea breakouts.  I no longer have bumps and bleeding.  The redness is lessening too.  I have struggled with Rosacea for years, antibotic creams were no longer working.  I was a little skeptical when I started using it...but now I am a believer, and am spreading the word.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after reading about it in a women&#x27;s magazine as a treatment for rosacea.  Not only have I recently developed rosacea, but I also had the crazy skin that so many people seem to complain about when they hit menopause.  My previously calm and clear skin had morphed into dry patches, oily patches and an occasional viscious outbreak of acne.  I never knew what was going to be looking back at me from the mirror.  Well - I can honestly say that this oil has helped things get back to normal.  I wash my face with a gentle bar soap at night and use 2 drops on each cheek and one drop on my forehead.  Within days, the redness had calmed down and some of the bumps on my cheeks had gone down.  I&#x27;m happy about those things, but the main reason I am giving this such a good rating is that the overall tone and feeling of my skin is back to where it was before - and it happened quickly!  I use this as I described above at night and then I use only one drop in each spot in the morning under my makeup.  You would think an oil would make my foundation less durable, but I have found it to be the opposite.  Maybe I don&#x27;t touch up my face as much because my skin is looking better.  Anyway - I will be stocking up on these little bottles because I have a feeling that between the magazines, Doctor Oz and the reviews on Amazon - this stuff is going to be hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE Jan 17, 2012:  I&#x27;ve never gone back in and given additional comments on a product here before, but I had to on this one.  My skin continues to improve.  I am still just shocked because it&#x27;s been such a short time using it.  Bought two more bottles for a girlfriend and her mother this weekend.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE Feb 23, 2012:  I&#x27;ll keep it brief - I will NEVER be without this product - NEVER.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE Sept 25, 2012 - Still using it.  Still loving it.  If I go for several days without it, inflammation on my cheeks starts to return.  I have now added a capsule form of this to my vitamin regimen because I want to take advantage of the anti-inflammatory benefits on my system as well.I want to take advantage of the anti-inflammatory benefits on my system as well.</li>
    <li> Since I have used this product, I have noticed improvement in my skin. My skin is starting to become more smoother and the rosacea is not as noticeable.</li>
    <li> I think it helps a little but not as i expected...im sure that my rosacea comes from within...what i mean is that i have what they call irritable bowel sindrome...and i think that thats what causes rosacea and other skin problems...its just an opinion..i eat everything maybe if i quit everything and start only eating veggies and stuff...but this helps a little i think maybe on papules and the skin apperance but not on redness...</li>
    <li> heard so much about it and after using it for over 2 weeks every day...i see absolutely no difference.  I am glad it was not expensive.</li>
    <li> Good quality oil.  I. Mix it with rose hip seed oil and carrot seed oil and argan. Nice smell</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this to help with a few rosacea spots on my nose. After 3 weeks of use, here are my thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;-This helped with the rosacea, lightening it a bit and decreasing inflammation.&lt;br /&gt;-My skin is overall softer, and appears more youthful, less dull.&lt;br /&gt;-After 3 weeks of use, I have not noticed any melasma spots fading.&lt;br /&gt;-The most unexpected and awesome result is all my blackheads around my nose have disappeared! I have tried retinols, benzoyl peroxide, etc for years with no results. They have literally disappeared!&lt;br /&gt;-I have had a lot if purging of my chronically inflamed clogged pores on my forehead, another unexpected and welcomed result.&lt;br /&gt;-This stuff smells TERRIBLE at first. I&#x27;m used to it now and enjoy the scent.</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis and dry skin on my elbows.  After literally two days of applying this oil, the skin is completey clear! I LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
    <li> This, along with some soap from Blue Sage Naturals, has utterly transformed my skin.  I love it and will never be without it.  SO healing and wonderful.</li>
    <li> I will be taking this for the rest of my life as if my life depends on it lol.  This stuff helped my skin, nails, and I havent paid attention to my hair.  Also, it helps with HUNGER AND MOOD somehow.  I swig this stuff down 2 times a day.  I have been taking this for 3 months and I didnt notice until the second month that my nails were strong and growing!! My nails, have NEVER been strong EVER.  I am continually anemic and my nails were brittle.  Thats not even why I bought it.  I bought it because I saw it in that magazine being recommended by Dr. Oz.  So, yeah, its good stuff.</li>
    <li> I am 66 years old...and my skin is dry...this oil keep my skin not only moist,but soft and silky....no skin breakouts..you need just a drop for your whole face......and according to others I look much younger than myears...thanks Buckthorn seed oil</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once and the smell was really nasty.  and, trust me when they say oil - they mean oil.  I&#x27;ll try it again...and give another review.  right off the bat; not impressed.  super oily. super smelly.  I&#x27;ll try a few more days and recap then...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m delighted whit this product, I have melasma, very bad! Thank you good for this wonderful product. Now,  my spots is going day by day, and my skin is very health, If I could I give this a 10 stars!!!</li>
    <li> This is another oil that I use in making cosmetics, anti-aging lotions and creams and body lotions. It works great and is essential in anti-aging creams.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised at how fast this worked at improving my overall skin fitness and appearance! It&#x27;s as if I&#x27;ve found the fountain of youth...within a week of using it my face glowed and was radiant.  The texture, complexion, and dryness all improved.  My face is now soft, finely textured, and supple. The fine wrinkles at my eyes and from smiling are decreasing and a monthly breakout healed up and went away over night.  My husband is so fascinated and impressed by its effectiveness that he has actually started using it!! Pretty impressive for a guy who never puts anything on his face except occasional sunscreen!  I use the Sibu soap followed by the oil every morning and evening, along with one of the oil capsule supplements.  The positive effect this has made is truly impressive.  I feel as if several years were taken off my age; I&#x27;m  sold on it for life!  Really, it&#x27;s no joke that nothing has ever been better for my skin. Thanks goes to Amazon for great prices and super quick shipping.    My skin stats: Sensitive and fair complexion - mostly dry skin. The occasional breakout.  Age in low 40&#x27;s with some smile lines, etc.</li>
    <li> Only reason I give it a 4 out of 5 is that the dispensing bottle is hard to use and I cant get enough oil out of it. This stuff for sure helped with my Rosacea , I dont know if it took the redness away, but it calmed my angry red skin. I am in love with this oil. recommend for sure</li>
    <li> This stuff is simply amazing.  I have never written a review before but I had to get on here and rave about it!  I just got this in the mail today, rubbed some on and it instantly relieved the itching of my eczema.  I moved to a new city and was waiting to get in to a doctor to get a new presciption for Elidel, the only thing that previously relieved my symptoms.  I wanted to try something natural in the interim and the rave reviews are warranted!  Like I said, the itching instantly subsided.  I was starting to get a scaly patch on my eyelid (the worst place to get it!) it was gone and smooth and supple within a few hours.  I had an open itchy sore on the inside of my arm that has diminished to the size of a pin prick.  And I just started using this stuff today!!  I can&#x27;t believe it!  Stop reading reviews and buy it now!</li>
    <li> My skin- combination, with rosacia and occasional mild breakouts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros- Helps with my facial rashes, and does not irritate or dry out my skin like many rosacia medications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons- Doesn&#x27;t smell great, but not too unpleasant. Its oily (duh, its an oil I know) but it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;soak in&amp;#34; very well, and sometimes gets in my hair and on my pillow. Also, it has a slight yellow/orange color that makes your face look tan in my case but possibly pumpkin-like if you are not super pale like me. Because of this, I only use it at night. I don&#x27;t really want to have a yellow, oily, slightly smelly face during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However- Even though there are downfalls, I still recommend this product. I have tried several prescription creams that dried out and irritated my skin and did not actually help my rosacia. This has been the best thing I have tried so far, not to mention the cheapest! All in all, worth giving it a shot if you have rosacia or dry skin. I may try a different brand next time and see if there is a difference.</li>
    <li> Just as described , fit the needs that I had in minds , quality is good and service was fast. Would order this again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, I wish I had this in my teenage years. Its good for early fresh scars or wherever there is redness. It will reduce inflammation and restore skin to normal tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure about long term scar reductions. I would recommend having this in ones arsenal along with a good blemish stick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was a coincidence or not but soon after starting to use this I broke out terribly. It was kind of embarrassing. I&#x27;ve stopped using just because I don&#x27;t want to break out like that again. It smells pretty bad too but I was willing to deal with that in the hopes it would help clear my redness and unevenness.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and am allergic to all over the counter skin care products and most Rx products. I am 61 years old and had a few mild crows feet and laugh lines around my eyes and some mild lines around my mouth from smoking for 40 years. I got this product 48 hours ago and tried some on my face right away. It took 5 drops each of the two times I applied it before bedtime to completely cover my face and rub it in good around my eyes and mouth. I cannot even see the lines around my eyes and the ones around my mouth should be completely gone in a week. I&#x27;m glad I bought more than one bottle of this for this first purchase. I am going to share one with my sister and order some more for my daughter, me and my daughters-in-law.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve come down with acne in my later years and the prescription medication that my Dermatologist prescribed was so drying that I started developing more age line (which I didn&#x27;t have before.)  I read about this Sea Buckthorn Seed Oil in one of Dr. Gott&#x27;s newspaper column and thought I would give it a try.  The very first day my pimples started clearing up and by the 5th day it was all gone and my skin looks better than it has in years.  Just one drop on each side of my face and a dab on my nose and chin at night after washing my face is all it takes.  I just splash tepid water on my face in the morning and that&#x27;s all I do.  I would recommend this product to anyone having a problem with acne.</li>
    <li> I was recently diagnosed with rosacea &amp; perioral dermatitis, possibly steroid/Retin-A induced..  My derm prescribed Oracea &amp; told me to stay away from topicals.  Cetaphil cream, which I used to swear by, started to break out my now super sensitive skin and nothing else would moisturize the red, flaky dermatitis.  Until I found this sea buckthorn seed oil.  I put it all over my face 2x a day, always as the first layer under jojoba oil, other moisturizers, sunscreens, etc.  After 3 weeks of this, my dermatitis is about 85% healed.  I won&#x27;t comment on it helping the rosacea, because I&#x27;ve learned how mentally taxing this condition is &amp; wouldn&#x27;t want to get anyone&#x27;s hopes up.  But it hasn&#x27;t caused any flares.  I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this oil &amp; will continue to use it.  I wish it came in a larger size.</li>
    <li> I bought this with the Buckthron bar for my adult acne, I have be troubled with it for serveral years and at nearly 50 thought I would finally be over it. NOT, Ive tried alot of product and this has seemed to be quite good at drying out and closing pores, when used with the bar my skin has gotten quite dry, almost like a chemical peel, but I&#x27;ve exfoliated and use pure shea butter at night and that seems to help. I&#x27;m ordering my second round, hopefully it will continue to work, my skin tends to get \\&quot;used to\\&quot; products and stop working after several rounds</li>
    <li> love it - stinky - but love it. I put it on at night as a serum and moisturizer. perfect and argon oil in the morning.</li>
    <li> I have been experiencing a  Rosacea breakout and this product has worked wonders. I also use this product around my eyes. The lines seem less noticeable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for my rosacea and rosacea acne.  It seems to be working fairly well for the last few days.  I&#x27;ve also used the berry oil which is much thicker in density and colour.  This seed oil is very light in density and colour and so it doesn&#x27;t stain your skin or clothes as much.  The berry oil will temporarily turn your skin an Oompa Loompa orange!  I&#x27;d recommend you try it and see if it works for you.</li>
    <li> This oil solved my dermatitis problem in a few weeks. I use this in conjunction with Sibu Day Cream and it works wonders. I mix 3 drops of the oil with the moisturizer at night and use the moisturizer alone in the morning. Highly recommended for sensitive skin. Natural product that works at a reasonable price point - you can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and was what I expected.  I would order again from this vendor.  Amazon always comes   through for me.  Thanks again.</li>
    <li> I use this as my evening face moisturizer and have been loving it!  It soaks nicely in my skin, doesn&#x27;t feel oily or slick and just a couple drops goes a long way!  I put a couple drops in my hand, rub my hands together and pat it all over my face and neck.  I wake up in the morning and my face looks great and I swear those little lines around my eyes look diminished!  My only negative is that it&#x27;s sometimes hard to get out of the bottle because it&#x27;s a thicker oil.  I&#x27;ve found that trying to shake it out doesn&#x27;t work so well, but tipping it on it&#x27;s side and tapping the bottom with my finger works best.</li>
    <li> I spent more than I should have after dr oz said this helped acne. I felt it may have even made it worse, not sure, but it did not help in the slightest .It is very thick and oily and I did not like the smell or the feel of it on my skin. So much so that I did not even want to use it on my body as a moisturizer so all was lost and I threw it in the trash. I was very dissapointed.</li>
    <li> This brand absorbs quickly into the skin.  It has been a part of my daily skin care regiment for a year now.</li>
    <li> No problems with delivery. Very good product.</li>
    <li> AMAZING stuff!! I have sensitive acne-prone skin and this stuff works miracles! My skin soaks it up quickly and I use only 4-5 drops of this oil immediately after I was my face -- both in the AM and PM. I really love the orange tint this product has naturally, as it gives my face, neck and decollete a nice summer glow. LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I bought this oil, and used it as a facial moisturizer in combination with the Sea Buckthorn bar soap as a facial cleanser. I used the soap once a day on my face to remove make up before bed, and used the oil twice a day. I generally have combination skin (some adult acne, mostly around my jaw line/chin area). These products definitely did not agree with my skin. I got both dried out (to the point of flaky/scaly skin all over my face) and deep painful zits all over my face that are not normal for me. I usually try to use a product until it&#x27;s gone to determine if I like it or not, but I could only stand using this for two weeks. Just to not waste the bar I&#x27;ve been using it as hand soap, but I would NOT recommend it for face care.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to use on my melasma(brown spots on my face caused by BCP).I used it at night and found the oil to be very soothing to the skin.I noticed it also has been helping some redness I had around my nose.I was concerned it might leave my skin greasy but so far it absorbs fairly quickly and does not feel overly heavy.My brown spots are fading,which is wonderful-I am using this along with an Oil of Olay product,but I believe the Sea Buckthorn oil is very helpful on its own.I love the way it makes my skin feel-as I said it is soothing,and I like that it is a natural product-no chemicals.I would reccomend this for spots and redness,it is also amazingly good for dryness,I had a dry spot on my forehead and just a small amount of the oil makes it feel smooth and hydrated.</li>
    <li> Wow,wow,wow! I would give this 10 stars if I could. The first day that I used this, I was amazed at what it did to my skin tone. It brightened, softened, and cleared some of the blemishes on my face in just one use. I was concerned that the bottle was too small to last me a good while, but because sea buckthorn seed oil is very rich please believe this bottle is going to last you some months. Also as a black woman, I&#x27;m constantly plagued by oily skin, hyper-pigmentation and acne scars, and even though the product is oily, it did not break me out and as I mention before it actually healed some of my acne already. I put just a little on my face during the day and I put the recommended dose at night, I put it under my makeup and sunscreen. Don&#x27;t worry about it being oily, your face will soak it all up, but just use a lil if you have oily skin. I love this product and I look forward to trying other formulas from this amazing seed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 02-28-2013&lt;br /&gt;I was just about to place another order for the buckthorn oil when I seen numerous complaints regarding people breaking out so I wanted to edit my initial review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I placed another order in July 2012 and I&#x27;m not sure whats going on, but something about the oil being sent out is different from the one I placed my review about. When I used the product from the second bottle it caused me to breakout so bad I actually didn&#x27;t suspect it at first because I have oily skin and it could have been anything else that I may have been using. However, when I put the oil on the breakouts like I had done before in the past it actually irritated my face and made the breakouts even more unmanageable.  Shame Shame Shame on the seller for reducing the efficiency of this product just to save or make money!!! This oil works so well for the conditions stated, it&#x27;s sad when you can&#x27;t even get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> its ok. not for my skin</li>
    <li> I use it after I wash my face as an astringent and a moisturizer.  I also have a skin tag that has shrunk somewhat since I&#x27;ve been applying this oil.</li>
    <li> After three days of use, I woke up this morning with absolutely NO REDNESS on my face!! I actually love the packaging because I know that the product is not being exposed to light/bacteria. I wish more products were packaged like this. (Okay, so maybe it takes an extra four seconds to get the product out, but who cares?) So far, I&#x27;m very pleased with the results and it sure beats forking over $250 for prescription rosacea cream!</li>
    <li> I bought this after hearing about how it helps rosacea. I&#x27;ve been on antibiotics (Oracea) and using Metrogel and was less than thrilled. I stopped using both and a lot of my flushing came right back so I decided to give this a try. Let me tell you, this stuff is great! It won&#x27;t take all of your redness away but it&#x27;s healed mine quite a bit. It&#x27;s also allowed me to use Retin-A again which I haven&#x27;t been able to use in years because it dried out my skin and really irritated it. I only use a few drops at a time (3-5) and use my Clarisonic and the Sibu bar soap to wash my face but it&#x27;s working. No more flushing and pustules on my face. I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
    <li> Only used it once on few spot on my face. Smell a little strong , but it worked only after one day. So very satisfied.</li>
    <li> My skin is so much better. It soothes my red rosacea dry skin. I am only using minimal foundation around my nose now. I have tried so many meds and so many skin products, this is the only thing giving me relief. Now i&#x27;m gonna order a bunch more!</li>
    <li> I have rosacea and I heard several years ago that seabuckthorn was good for it.&lt;br /&gt;I began using the Facedoctor Seabuckthorn soap and have have used it daily every since so when I read that the Seabucthorn Seed Oil was also good for the redness and softer skin I decided to add it to my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing my face with the soap I use my precription, Finacea, and after that is dry and absorbed I will use just a few drops of the seed oil on my face... and never go out without sunblock :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with the results!&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs quickly into my skin and is not greasy at all (unless you just put way too much on...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also read that you want to be sure to get the pure Seabuckthorn SEED oil, with nothing added to it.&lt;br /&gt;My rosacea is under control except for occasional flare ups and those are few and far between.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble with moderate acne since high school. I&#x27;m 20 years old with fair, combination skin, and I usually break out around my mouth, chin, and nose. Usually nothing cystic, but I had least about one large pimple a week, usually around my mouth (So big and painful, always white-heads and almost all of them left scars). Like anyone with acne knows, it was EXTREMELY frustrating. I felt like no matter how persistent I was about applying salycilic acid or benzoyl peroxide creams, I could never fully prevent or heal all of my breakouts. I tried retin-a cream, but that didn&#x27;t seem to prevent anything (did help with scars though!). Tried salycilic peels, milk of magnesia (good for very mild acne), zeno (big waste of money), ice, clarisonic, but nothing really seemed to get all the breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently this year I&#x27;ve been fiddling around with my regimen a LOT, so this oil probably isn&#x27;t the only reason I&#x27;ve been able to clear up my face.&lt;br /&gt;But, since I started using it two weeks ago, I have had ZERO serious large pimples. Zeerrooo. I don&#x27;t know how or why, but this stuff seriously works.&lt;br /&gt;I was actually inspired to write a review because I was thinking today: \\&quot;Hmmm, when was the last time i had to pop a zit? .... I can&#x27;t remember!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I use 1-2 drops of this oil mixed in with a dab of moisturizer twice a day after I wash my face. You can use it alone without mixing it, but i prefer this way so i can get as much use as I can out of the tiny bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like a lot of other people have said, yes, it smells. It fades away very quickly, and it&#x27;s not THAT repulsive (at least to me). Almost equivalent the the smell of fish, but it&#x27;s seriously worth the stinky-ness. It&#x27;s deep orange in color, but it doesn&#x27;t show on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for two weeks, I still have almost the whole bottle left, so it looks like it will last a long time despite it&#x27;s size, hooray!&lt;br /&gt;The zits I did still get after using this were extremely small surface bumps, not deep or scarring (using bb cream is helping with these). I also didn&#x27;t notice an effect on my large nose pores, but it certainly hasn&#x27;t made them worse. As for anti-aging, I&#x27;m still relatively young so I didn&#x27;t notice much.&lt;br /&gt;I do not have rosacea, but my face tends to be a bit on the red side sometimes. Haven&#x27;t notice much of a difference there either.&lt;br /&gt;The results are so good it almost feels like this has \\&quot;cured\\&quot; my acne. Doesn&#x27;t feel like anything is hiding under my skin at all! I&#x27;m sure others understand what I mean, when your face is relatively clear, but it just feels like you still have something waiting to come out underneath. I don&#x27;t feel like that at all with this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned before I have been messing around with my routine a lot lately, but I can definitely say that this oil made the biggest difference! I feel so much better about my skin, and having less large, painful breakouts feels great! I just wish I had found this earlier. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it if you have problems with acne. It&#x27;s only been two weeks but I already feel so much more confident about my face! Seriously LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff! Only con is the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I hear it also works if you take it in capsules, but that is a LOT more expensive (30 bucks for 60 capsules??!?) so I&#x27;d definitely recommend trying out the topical treatment first.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try to update again later if I can remember!</li>
    <li> I think I received an old bottle, the rubber stopper top was cracked or split and the oil has a very strong/rancid smell.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I heard about this product. I thought,\\&quot;Finally something that will work for my acne!\\&quot; It worked great for the first week but then I started to break out. Also, the smell would make me feel sick. So sad, I was really hoping this would help.</li>
    <li> Now that I have found it, I cannot live without this product. I have very sensitive, normal to oily skin, and this oil is soothing, and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> really awesome super duper good deal nice product perfect recommended and so much more and on and on and on!</li>
    <li> Purchased this after it was recommended as a product to try on an episode of Dr. Oz.  I have moderate rosacea and I have tried so many products to try to alleviate the redness, dryness, and irritation.  I applied this for a week,  but I can&#x27;t tolerate the smell of the product.  To me it smells too organic like fresh cut hay, or grasses.  Won&#x27;t use it because of that reason.  I will try to add a few drops of essential oil, and try again.  Despite the smell, it really moisturizes the skin, and didn&#x27;t irritate my rosacea.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for about 3 months now and it works great. I just had a baby so my hormones are still stabilizing, resulting in some breakouts. This oil works better than any acne treatment I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I use it at night as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with my sensitive skin allergies. I get itchy red bumps every spring into summer for the past 5 years. This really did help it heal faster than plain lotion. The only thing I didn&#x27;t realize is that there is a warning for pregnant or breastfeeding women (which I am) to contact their DR before using. But really... I should&#x27;ve realized that anyway since we have to double check with everything. I used it VERY sparingly.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product numberous times on the Dr. Oz show.  I don&#x27;t run out and buy everything that he discusses but, after several shows, decided to give it a try. I have had rosacia &amp; psoriasis on my face as far back as I can remember.  I have always treated the psoriasis with creams from the dermatologist which result in broken capillaries, sort of a catch 22.  This oil used sparingly twice a day on affected areas not only clears up the flaky, dry, itchy skin but, gets rid of the redness as well.  The small bottle will last a very long time.  It does not smell that great but, that is the natural smell of the oil and a very small price to pay for nice, clear skin.  I do put regular moisturizer on top.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like it and don&#x27;t have any complains about product, it helped my lips to recover after herpes. It is cheaper then the same in Whole food store!!! in Whole food it was $16!</li>
    <li> Itis grate for dry skin and pimples.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on a whim  to use at night as a serum. I didn&#x27;t realize that it aids with excezma, which is a bonus, as it will now be something I use when my daughter has a flair up.The oil has a distinct smell. It&#x27;s not bad, rather like damp leaves or something that grows, but it&#x27;s not what I would describe as pleasant either. However, it wouldn&#x27;t detract from my using this item. I find that it leaves my skin feeling very calm and moisturized. I have sensitive skin and am prone to bouts of peri-oral dermatitis so I have to be very picky about what I put on my face and this product is something I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful and has greatly helped to heal my scars and marks from rosacea..love it.  I thought the price was reasonable also</li>
    <li> This product really helped my acne rosacea.  I had better results than with prescribed antibiotics and rosacea medications including ointments.  It smells a little weird but the smell is nothing compared to the results.</li>
    <li> I use this at night on my face.  It took a little getting used to and you do not need much.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a positive difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea on my face . Went to the doctor to get medical treatment it worked for a few months. But then it stopped working and my rosacea was starting to get worst . So I jumped on YouTube to see what will help with my problem and saw this product was getting great rates so I bought it and what can I say . I noticed great improvement in two days ever since I been using it twice a day everyday and haven&#x27;t had any problems with my rosacea since very very happy and glad I bought this .!! It also works for pimples and acne!!! Doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell to it. I only pump less then a dime size for my whole face . If I could I would get this product 10 stars . I also bought the sea buckthorn juice in the white bottle. The bar face soap, the gel pills and the nourishing facial cream . And I will keep on buying these products over and over . They are cheaper on Amazon than at vitamin shoppe.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell it&#x27;s really strong but I will use the oil if would work for me even with the smell&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I have 2 spots of melasma that I want to get rid off for a long time and I thought this may help&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t work for melasma I don&#x27;t even see like a glow in my skin when I use it, for me it didn&#x27;t do any thing.</li>
    <li> I have severe rosacea. Metrogel wasn&#x27;t working anymore. I had been using La Roche Posay Toleraine with success until that too gave up on me! The nose on my skin was severly peeling....terrible....terrible....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give the Buckthorn Seed Oil since it claimed that it was effective against Rosacea. Within a day the peeling disappeared. The redness too has gone down drastically(I used to look like Rudolph). I use only a drop or so for each affected area 2ce a day after cleansing. Extremely satisfied so far (about a month)....</li>
    <li> This is a remarkable product.  I had been reading good things about sea buckthorn and decided to give it a try for age spots.  I&#x27;ve only been using it a week, and I&#x27;m astonished at how well it&#x27;s working.  I&#x27;ve only put it on a few select areas so I could easily keep track of any changes (and also to make sure I wouldn&#x27;t have any kind of reaction).  I&#x27;m 53 and have quite a few age spots on my face, and a few others here and there.  Some of the age spots are more reddish, and some are brown.  The reddish ones are fading after just a week!  In fact, I could tell a difference after the first use.  The brown age spots are not doing as well, but I am quite willing to give those more time.  I also tried it on two scars -- one on my leg, and one on my temple, and the scars are shrinking and becoming less noticeable!  I tried this on a deep wrinkle and I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen any change there, but again, it&#x27;s only been a week.  I think it will help with wrinkles too, judging from other reviews -- I just need to give it a little time.  In addition, this oil does not leave your face greasy, so you can use it during the day if you like.  It absorbs well and you only need a teeny amount anyway; plus it leaves your skin feeling very soft.  I highly recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/2/2013 Update:  After using this for over a month now, I can see huge differences in my wrinkles, and my age spots are continuing to improve.  My skin has a smooth, soft look and feel that I love.  I seriously look 10 years younger!  I encourage everyone to give this a try.</li>
    <li> I heard really god reviews about this product. However, I feel like I haven&#x27;t seen my dark spots or scars diminishing any faster than they usually do. The container itself is hard to dispense. You have to tap/shake it out and it usually requires a lot of effort. I do not like this one bit. I suppose if I were to use it nightly, I would see better results. The dispensing of this container deters me from using it often.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003IU9HI0 Sea Buckthorn Seed Oil]]This oil is absolutely fantastic for my rosacea!  I use it every night and no longer have tiny little pimples appear on my face. It has also toned down the red in my cheeks. Hence, I call it my miracle oil and wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
    <li> recently my cheeks were red and breaking out (something new for me) and a friend even commented on it, suggesting i might have rosacea...  i did some research both on rosacea and what one could do for it and came across this.  had some concerns about putting oil on my face (thinking it would just add to the problem), but figured i&#x27;d give it a try.  been using it for almost a week now, and what a difference!!  contrary to what you&#x27;d think, it does NOT make your face oily (it absorbs quite quickly), and the only negative is that it does have a smell that while not totally unpleasant, is not particularly appealing either....  however, it does seem to go away (the smell, that is) fairly quickly, so it is a small price to pay.  my entire face looks much better - not only the areas on my cheeks.  hooray!!!  Update:  while I still like this, I will probably look for another seller because this is the second time that I have opened a new bottle only to have the top black rubber around the top be &amp;#34;melty&amp;#34; for lack of a better term... the oil was tinted black and the entire top was covered with &amp;#34;melted&amp;#34; black &amp;#34;goo&amp;#34; from the rubber around the dropper... therefore I have downgraded my rating.  The oil itself I&#x27;d give a 4, but with the last 2 I&#x27;ve opened having this same prob,  I have to downgrade to a 2...</li>
    <li> This sea buckthorn oil worked well in the creation of my all-natural face wash. Not the best smelling ingredient though.</li>
    <li> Light, emollient and soothing.  Perfect for distressed skin. Glides on and absorbs quickly.  No greasy feeling and happy skin in the morning</li>
    <li> I do like this oil, and I think I will continue buying it.  It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling all over your skin.  A word of caution to anyone who is very sensitive to smells like I am . . . it does have what I consider to be an unpleasant smell.  I have to admit that  am getting used to it as time goes on, but my first application was unpleasant because I used it on my face and the smell made me a little sick to my stomach.  It gets easier to live with the smell as time goes on, and it does dissipate after a while.</li>
    <li> For a product that took my rosacea breakouts from a 9 to a 1 or 2, I have to give it 5 stars. Nothing has ever worked except oral antibiotics, which I wanted to avoid. I am thrilled to have found this product. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and I can&#x27;t foresee ever being without it again. I would classify this product as a control, rather than a cure, unfortunately. But I&#x27;ll use it until there is a cure.</li>
    <li> I have used the cleanser, serum and facial lotion. I do not care for the oil. Sticky and I dont care for the smell. I am probably just going to toss it. I found Pristine Beauty. Lux lotion for face and neck and that is the product I would recommend.</li>
    <li> For the past month I had an awfully dry skin patches on my face and nothing would help - I tried a whole buch of different cremes and nothing worked. Then somebody told me about buckthorn seed oil.  I put it on once and my dry skin patches were gone. It is magic!</li>
    <li> This oil is very light &amp; absorbs very well.  At the same time it makes your skin feel smooth, then helps w/ random outbreaks of acne.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this product under my eyes at night before bed definitely gives a smoother feeling and moisturized feeling without being greasy.  I&#x27;m on my second order.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over two weeks to help with my mild rosacea symptoms (splotchy cheeks, red bumps, dry skin).  While it hasn&#x27;t made me break out, which is a concern because it&#x27;s an oil, it hasn&#x27;t really done anything to relieve my splotchy cheeks or bumps.  It HAS helped with dryness. I would spot apply this to dry skin before bed and in the morning, no more dry skin.  I&#x27;m going to keep using until the bottle runs out but I am still not sure I would reorder.</li>
    <li> I have had rosacea for years and I have had no luck with what my dermatologist prescribed. He suggested that I get laser treatment. I would prefer not to. I have tried many other products. This is the only one that has made a difference. As some have commented, it doesn&#x27;t make your skin perfect immediately. I had never heard of the mites one reviewer mentioned. After some research and based on my experience I am in agreement that this is the cause of my rosacea. After I applied the product my skin became bright red where I have rosacea but not elsewhere on my skin. I got a magnifying mirror and could see small white bits coming out of my pores. I just assumed that it was like the stuff that comes out of pimples. But now in retrospect it was most likely from the mites. My skin has cleared considerably in a week. I apply before bedtime so the redness is not an issue and it looks great in the morning. I am not saying it is gone completely but I would say that there is a 30% improvement. More than I have gotten with anything else.</li>
    <li> The jury is still out as I have only used this for a few weeks but so far I really like the way it makes y face feel and have had no problems with break outs or anything that sometimes comes with a new product.  So far, I really like it and have used it everyday on my face.</li>
    <li> Likes:  Less noisome than neem oil.  Neem is too much for my skin, so if you are looking for a lighter alternative, sea buckthorn seed oil may be it.  It&#x27;s viscous enough to hold powder (for example, if you like to add crushed Vitamin C or aspirin to your oils).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yikes!  I still don&#x27;t like the smell.  Plus, I simply can&#x27;t tell that sea buckthorn seed oil is more beneficial than, say, coconut or other vegetable oils.  It does cost more than less exotic oils.  It&#x27;s fine for what it is (a seed oil), but I&#x27;m not planning to purchase more because it hasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;done anything&amp;#34; for me and less expensive oils work just fine.</li>
    <li> The bottle I got was less than 2/3 full.  I wrote to the company and they said that was normal, but it didn&#x27;t seem right to me and I felt a bit ripped off.  The consistency is nice, and a little drop goes a long way, but to me it smells rancid.  For a high quality oil I thought it would smell more neutral.  I resist putting it on my face at night because I don&#x27;t want to smell it or have it on my pillowcase.</li>
    <li> I always use this when I have a pimple and it actually works. It is not too harsh on your skin.</li>
    <li> I am sorry to report it didn&#x27;t do a thing for my rosacea. Smells good though, like cucumber but is very greasy. Good luck to others.</li>
    <li> I use this product to cure every skin blemish from unsightly pimples to bits. It&#x27;s a cure all.  Gave it to my sisters for Christmas and now they&#x27;re hooked too.</li>
    <li> i could use a little more moisture, but it appears to make skin smoother, ihave ordered the moisterizer to see if that is better for me, i will use this a little longer to see if it can fade scars more</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE! This product caused my rosacea to flare up and my face breakout. So disappointed as it had great reviews.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything known to man for my rosacea, both prescription and non. This is the only product I&#x27;ve used that actually reduces the bumps.  Be warned, you will look flushed when you first put it on but it does resolve. If you use this at night, you face should look much better in the morning.</li>
    <li> amazing product. Use it as a facial moisturizer every night. Soaks into your skin immediately. Have reordered many times. Also works great on burns.</li>
    <li> sea buckthorn is said to help rosacea. i didn&#x27;t see any help there and it made me breakout. it&#x27;s now just sitting in my fridge. you may benefit from it, i didn&#x27;t. won&#x27;t buy it again. maybe i can use it on my hands.</li>
    <li> Amazing oil. I use it in my face oil blend and find it works well to reduce the redness on my cheeks.</li>
    <li> After trying many different prescription and non-prescription products to treat my persistent rosacea, I decided to give this a try.  In the first week of use my breakouts got worse. But, after seeing reviews from many who had the same experience and then saw improvement, I decided to stick it out. I am so glad that I did.  I have not had a breakout for over a month and I am sold.  I only wish that I had found this product years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Since I wrote this review, I ran out and went a week without the oil while I waited for my reorder. Within a few days, my skin was once again breaking out as it had before I began using the oil. I finally received my order and within days, my skin was clear and considerably less red.  I LOVE this stuff! I will not let it run out again. I am amazed by how well it works.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for softening cuticles and for treating minor injuries.</li>
    <li> I have had a severe skin allergy and this gave so much relief. I felt normal again and not scratching is so amazing! I will buy this again &amp; again-quick delivery and exactly the product that was described!</li>
    <li> My package was received on time &amp; wrapped accordingly.  I use this oil for acne, dry skin insect bites.  I used this on my arm after arm cast on for over 3 months and helped with skin irritation.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s a fast delivery.  It makes my skin very soft.  It is not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> Not seeing the benefit.</li>
    <li> This stuff took away the redness around my nose/under the eyes (possibly for rosacea), it faded marks from old acne, and seemed to help with my blackheads somehow. A few drops go a long way. The smell is strong but fades away quickly. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> so i bought this for the great reviews about acne....now let me tell you I&#x27;ve tried everything which includes accutane which only made my face worst :(. I eventually went back on ocp which has helped to manage but I still get pretty bad break outs. This DID NOT HELP WITH ACNE. But if you happen to accidently scatch them, it helps with the healing process, less of a scar. I still developed scars..just not as hyperpigmented.&lt;br /&gt;And most importantly it didn&#x27;t cause me to break out. I put it on at night, it&#x27;s an orange yellow color. Blends in just fine, you can do morning if you wanted to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for the last few weeks as a treatment for my hands for the extreme dryness this brutal winter has brought on.  I am amazed by how well just a little bit applied just before going to bed relieves the extreme dryness.  Well worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about everything for my rosacea and SBO is the only thing that works!! Every day I wash with a prescription sulfacetamide cleanser and I use this oil (one drop in the summer and two in winter), that&#x27;s it. No more bumps or redness!</li>
    <li> i did not experience any benefits and seems to dry the skin a lot.</li>
    <li> Great product, thanks!</li>
    <li> Hi! Nature has created a great thing. Buckthorn in their properties has unique properties. Very useful for burns. Thank you mother nature. Sincerely customer.</li>
    <li> Great product - it worked well for me, it&#x27;s not messy at all and quickly absorbs into the skin. I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Gave it my best shot, but found it didn&#x27;t improve my condition.  The oil has a smell, is greasy and the fumes it gives off made my eyes sting.</li>
    <li> Overall, I like this oil, since it&#x27;s helping me in the original way that I wanted it to. But I also think it caused me to break out in eczema for the first time ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For several years now, I get random bouts of extreme itching in my eyelashes, which rubbing usually causes them to fall out. It was so intense, I could not tolerate it. After doing a lot of research, and not finding many helpful articles on the subject, I came to believe that demodex mites may be the cause. I also read that this oil apparently suffocates those mites. I figured it was worth a try.. I bought this stuff, hoping it would help with the itching, even though I was nervous about getting it directly in my eyes. For a few weeks straight -- once in the morning, and once at night -- I squeezed two drops of the oil onto one end of a q-tip, and I carefully put it along my upper lash line, then put two drops on the other side of the q-tip for the other eye, only for hygiene purposes -- I didn&#x27;t want to risk spreading mites from one eye to the other, just in case that was possible. This stuff has basically worked wonders for me. It has an almost numbing agent in it, where it would relieve any irritation within seconds of putting it on. Now, I only use it maybe once or twice a week, and my eyes have been doing really well. I still get occasional irritation and itching along my lash line, but it&#x27;s not nearly as intense as it was once, and I can usually relieve it by gently rubbing. I do hope that using this will not effect my eyes or vision in any negative way. I&#x27;m sure this oil is not recommended or approved for use on the eyelids, so I&#x27;m not saying try it, but if you&#x27;re desperate, you may want to consider trying this, as I&#x27;ve had good luck with it. I think I did get some of it in my eyes a few times, but it didn&#x27;t burn or anything. It just felt uncomfortable for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I say this oil may be bad, is once I saw how much it was helping my eyes, I started mixing a few drops into my shampoo and also into my moisturizer since my face was getting a little dry and red, and I had seborrheic dermatitis on my scalp, so I thought the oil may help calm my skin down and smooth it out. Well, after only about 2 days of using it, I started to break out in large red blotches on my forehead. My scalp didn&#x27;t seem to get any worse, but my face looked terrible, it was all dry and scaly and peeling. I went to the dermatologist and he was able to treat it, but now I use this oil only on my eye lash line, and I am very happy with the results I&#x27;ve had in that regard.</li>
    <li> I paid for this item but did not receive it. disappointing!!! But I am still hoping that I will get it someday. Still waiting...!!!!</li>
    <li> I have moderate Rosacea which unfortunately includes broken capillaries on my cheeks and two nasty bright red spider veins on my nose but nothing too severe yet thank god! So basically it&#x27;s my skin tone I bought this for. I made the purchase thinking praying and hoping it would even out my skin tone. When I first started using the sea buckthorn oil it seemed to be working great. I did notice some slight differences in my skin (brighter and more toned) but dried it out more than anything. Unfortunately my sun damaged skin still shows below the outer layers near my cheeks and nose that I cannot get rid of no matter what I try and sincerely depresses me to no end. After using this product for some time the effects eventually wore off and this product actually made it look worse than it was. My sun damaged skin once again reared its ugly head. I don&#x27;t think it effectively clears up damaged skin below the surface but maybe on the surface that&#x27;s a different story. Could be also that I was using more than I should have but that&#x27;s cause I noticed no dramatic results. I have now ordered Vitamin C serum and a carrot oil soap rich in vitamins and supposedly very helpful to even out skin tone, we will see. All is all I was disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for its healing properties.  Unfortunately I had an allergic reaction after 4 to 5 day uses.  It began as a mild subtle itch and tuned into fine bumps that itched all time everywhere the oil had been applied.</li>
    <li> This has a nasty odor like it has gone bad. Not sure if it works or not, the smell is so bad that I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a few days of using this.&lt;br /&gt;At first I used the suggested amount of drops, my face became red, swollen, and cystic acne appeared.&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using for a few days to let it clear, and tried one SMALL drop on each side of my face. (Thats two drops for the entire face). My face has become a little more flushed/red looking, but the \\&quot;bumps\\&quot; on my face have gone down. The texture from my rosacea is much better, I&#x27;ll post updates if it gets worse or better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: THOUGH it helped with rosacea for awhile, It made my cystic acne much worse with this (It was very painful to even move some parts of my face).. It could have been a reaction, or it could have been the \\&quot;worse before better\\&quot;. But my skin looked so bad from the cystic acne that I couldn&#x27;t justify using it everyday. It&#x27;s good time to time. The oil is a lot more potent than the facial cleanse, obviously, but the first time I used this I saw cystic acne when I used the suggested amount. I tried using a lot less oil, and still developed very bad cystic acne. I&#x27;m hesitant on using this oil again, I really don&#x27;t want scarring on my face.</li>
    <li> I am post menopausal and have been plagued with acne breakouts and large pores my whole life.  So, believe me when I tell you I would never put oil on my face.  I read about Sea Buckthorn oil I decided to give it a try.  I am amazed!!  I have only used it for about 4 days but already my skin looks good enough to go out without makeup - something I never usually do.  My skin looks and feels smoother, my pores are smaller and any pimples I had healed and disappeared.  A little goes a long way and absorbs quickly.  I use it after I wash on my face and neck in the morning and at night before I go to bed.  I have also noticed my crows feet are less noticeable already.  I hope with continued use it will also help some of my other little wrinkles as well.  I would definitely recommend this product(and already have.)</li>
    <li> Like Argan oil much better. Sea buckthorn oil has an smell that is unappealing.  Can&#x27;t see a difference between the two except for the smell.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to help my (very mild) rosacea, and bought this based on the reviews.  I am on my second bottle, and see absolutely no difference in the rosacea, but it has done wonders for the dryness of my skin, and the creases in my forehead are practically invisible now.  I found that it was a bit too greasy to apply straight, so I mix a couple of drops into my moisturizer at night, and that works really well.  It also makes the smell not so strong.</li>
    <li> I am one of the ones who never write reviews. Well unless i believe in the product. And in this product i believe in. I have rosacea on my nose and cheeks. The worst kind. The kind with the horrible red bumps and peeling and the worst redness ever. I have tried the antibiotics and the finacea cream that only made it worse. I soon learned that i was gonna have to live with this as painful as it was. I researched about rosacea and found that shea butter helped so i used shea butter just to keep it at a minimum. Shea butter and Idealist by estee Lauder. I mixed the 2 together and it really helped. Then i read about&lt;br /&gt;sea buckthorn oil and after the reviews i decided to try it. Well i did and i honestly cant believe the results. With in a day i could tell it was working.The redness has disappeared and there are no more red bumps. And i can actually see my real nose!! The skin after all the inflammation and dryness kinda left some sort of rough texture on my nose and now it is smooth again. The way a nose is supposed to be. Soft and smooth. Please  if you suffer from rosacea you have to try this. This product works!!</li>
    <li> This product made my skin very soft and smooth! Helped greatly to prevent and heal blemishes. I&#x27;ve heard that many people dislike the smell but I find it quite pleasant and earthy</li>
    <li> I am on an acne medication that heavily dries my skin, I put this on every night and wash it off in the morning, my skin stays moisturized and soft the next day with using only a light lotion under my makeup. It also has helped remove redness left by acne scarring and severe drying. I saw results after 3 nights of using The smell is a little fishy but nothing unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this was helpful! This product is definitely worth trying!</li>
    <li> I started using the sibu buckthorn oil for roscea 2 months ago.  I have mild roscea and have been using metrolotion for a few years which has helped somewhat.  I can&#x27;t believe the difference in 2 months.  I no longer use the metrolotion.  I am a 55 year woman and my skin looks wonderful.  My roscea has lessened, small marks and brown spots are much lighter, skin is super soft and I swear my skins feels a little tighter.  I love this product and can&#x27;t wait to see what my face looks like in 6 months.  It even heals up the small pimples I sometimes used to get and seems to heal small cuts nicely.  I now use this for cuts, the mild eczema I have have on my hands and lower arms and pimples. Heals quickly - no longer need to use desonide or metrolotion - would rather heal with a natural product than a drug if possible and this stuff certainly does the trick for me.  LOVE IT!!  My eye doctor (allergies and blepharitis) told me to drink Sea Buckthorn tea and then put the tea bags as compresses on my eyes - starting that next weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took about 3 weeks before I began to really notice all the different changes on my face, so be patient.  Also, my face breaks out easily and I was nervous about putting oil on my skin - well, no more!  My skin is clear and creamy looking and I love it.  I&#x27;ve also started putting this on my hands - I want to see what it does for age spots - thought it might work since the 3 brown spots on my face are almost gone now...</li>
    <li> i have rosacea and this is the only stuff I’ve found that doesn’t make my skin react. it does add a little orange color so i only put it on at night but it seems to help</li>
    <li> I have Morgellons Disease (a skin parasite) and it&#x27;s hard to find something that kills it that isn&#x27;t water-based (which really burns any open lesions). This oil is great--after a few days, the parasite nests were dying and coming out of my skin. I&#x27;m sure this will help with other skin disorders as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this a try after reading recommendations that it can help with rosacea.</li>
    <li> Heard about this on famous TV doctor&#x27;s show. Thought I would give it a try. The results have been amazing. I have been fighting blemishes for years and this is the treatment that has shown the best results. It was hard to find locally but I am glad I found it here at a great price. Thank you.....</li>
    <li> Had an operation and was using what the doctor recommended and it was doing OK.  When I switched to the Sea Buckthorn in 3 weeks my scar is almost invisible.  I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Two weeks and no improvement with Rosacea. Description is full of false promises &amp;#34;aid in the relief of skin conditions such as rosacea, eczema, acne, wrinkles, age-spots, and other skin ailments&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is a really great oil for the skin.  It takes of any redness, blemishes or boo-boos that I get.  It is organic and sustainably sourced, which is nice, too.  The down side is that this smells less than pleasant.  If you can overlook the smell, this is a very beneficial product.  My full review of this product and other products from the sibu line can be found at [...]</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!  I have tried Azelex (second best thing besides this oil - I use cream 20%), antibiotics (made it worst!), benzoyl peroxide (makes my skin red and blistered) and tretinoin (adapalene gel .1%) -  this is the only thing that works.  I actually have stop going to my dermo (who I wasn&#x27;t impressed with anyway) because my skin is better than before my rosacea started 2 years ago.  Came across this oil in a rosacea forum and thought I had nothing to lose.  I was so sick of following my dr&#x27;s orders and still getting cysts, whiteheads, blackheads, red/sensitive skin, and painful bumps.  In fact, my rosacea was starting to cause eye problems (dryness).  I have been on this stuff for a month and don&#x27;t run to the bathroom every morning to see how bad my skin is.  In fact, I forget about my skin which is hard to do when you have rosacea.  Here&#x27;s the timeline of my skin on this stuff:  Days 1 - 4 - skin started clearing up and blemishes were healing.  My sensitivity stop.  Day 4 - week 2 - blackheads were disappearing but started to get whiteheads.  Small ones but was little worried if I was going down the wrong road.  But no longer getting large cysts or painful bumps so it might be worth the trade.  Weeks 3 - 4 - Supermodel skin!  Whiteheads and blackheads have disappeared.  All old blemishes have disappeared.  And as a bonus, red marks from former blemishes have disappeared.  Stop wearing foundation to cover redness/blemishes/scars.  I use this oil at night after washing my face.  A little goes a long way (only need about 3 - 4 drops).  And yes, it smells horrible.  But the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.  In the morning after washing my face, I mix one drop of oil with my Azelex cream and apply.  This product is the best thing that ever happen to my skin so hopefully it works for you too.</li>
    <li> This Sibu Sea Buckthorn Seed Oil arrived before the promised delivery date. It has a good expiration date on it. I will re-purchase from The Vitamin Shoppe. This is an incredible savings on Sibu products. In a weeks use pores are minimized and wrinkles diminished on my face. Amazing results from this little bottle of oil!</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff. I use it under moisturizer and make up every winter when my skin gets dry and beaten up by the weather. Keeps my complexion clear and soft.</li>
    <li> thick, slimy, and no results</li>
    <li> This stuff smells! While waiting for this item to arrive I have been using JoJoba oil the last few days  and it has virtually no odor. This Buckthorn Seed oil reeks! I do have a good sense of smell, but I think I&#x27;d rather smell my dogs.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it&#x27;s as good as everyone says, but at the moment if I don&#x27;t see any better results than JoJoba oil, I will be using it rather than this smelly stuff.</li>
    <li> Very good product for the money. A little goes a long way. Absorbs quickly - really nice.</li>
    <li> I really love this oil and have used it for about a year. I use it nightly around my eyes. Wonderful! and not oily!</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff.  I use it twice a day to keep my rosaca away.  Better then any prescription I have used.  It also works great on my daughters teenage breakouts.  Clears zits overnight.</li>
    <li> I initially bought this oil for my moms rosacea, which worked pretty well. I personally started using it for my lashes. It helped grow out my lashes. \o/</li>
    <li> I bought this product after doing much research on a regimen for acne and acne scars. I have struggled with acne since i was in middle school and now that I am older i have some acne scars and may get a blemish from time to time. Although my skin is naturally oily I have found this product to work for me. I wash my face at night and rub a thin layer of oil over my entire face and dab and rub in another layer over scar areas or pimples. In the morning pimples are barely there or are gone and my skin has a glow. This product does have a scent to it almost like a vitamin smell but it doesnt bother me since i only use it at night.</li>
    <li> I have been using many organic beauty oils (jojoba, rose, argan) and they were really good, but this one makes such a difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance and texture. Makes my skin velvety, smooth and healthy (plus it gives a hint of sun-kissed, healthy color). p.s This is my second bottle.</li>
    <li> I got it because I read about it helping rosacea.  Don&#x27;t bother ordering it, not to mention the smell is offensive.</li>
    <li> Well, the product appears to be quality, but it simply didn&#x27;t do much for my rosacea. I&#x27;ve applied it once a day for about a week and only saw a very slight (if any)  decrease in redness over that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because i have an oily skin already i could only handle so much of this product. Perhaps if your skin is dry you will see a better result. It&#x27;s a shame though, i was really excited reading all the \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; reviews. The search continues.</li>
    <li> Sufferer from severe rosacea and adult acne for four years. I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this stuff is quite amazing.  The first day I think I used too much of this product because I woke up and my face was quite dry, but I did notice that it dried out a lot of acne.  My face was also extremely flaky so I used a face scrub (honey and sugar...works as good as any other scrub) to get rid of dried skin cells.  Second day I still noticed that my face was dry but my rosacea was much, much better (a lot less red).  Third day I decided to use three drops of product and put into my night time moisturizer.  This helped a lot for dryness.  Fourth day, my skin still felt flaky so I did another face scrub of honey and sugar and applied the product to my moisturizer.  Well, to my surprise, on the fifth day, I woke up to a new face.  Normally, I wake up to a red, bumpy mess with one large cyst that doesn&#x27;t go away.  This morning, my face feels smooth, cyst is down to a minimal.  I forgot that my skin is white!  I also noticed that the only dry patch is around the tiny cyst. I have tried numerous products and spent a lot of money over the years for my rosacea problem and nothing worked.  I am truly amazed that a product that will last for months and costs so little works so well! I hope everyone that purchases this product gets the same results as I did.  P.S.  The smell is a little fishy but goes away less than a minute and the oil seeps through skin real fast.</li>
    <li> the smell is bad, and fish. i can&#x27;t stand  with it, and not even works on my acne. give up</li>
    <li> I hate the bottle because the only way I can get the oil out is to bang it hard on my wrist and only a little drop comes out. The oil didn&#x27;t help my rosacea, but it did help me another way when taken internally. When I hear bad news and get upset, I take a little of this and I feel relaxed.</li>
    <li> Over the past ten years I have ordered tens of thousands of dollars worth of products for personal and professional use and while I have considered writing a review for a few products have not yet been moved to do so until using the Sea Buckthorn Seed Oil.  I found it during on ongoing search to even my skin tone due to mild rosacea across the bridge of my nose and moderate melasma towards my jaw on both sides. Previously I have had dermatological peels and laser treatment but with the recession, just can&#x27;t afford that any more.  I ordered this a little over a month ago and see absolute visible improvement in overall skin tone.  The rosacea is much better and while I had little hope that this would do anything with the melasma, it actually has.  I enjoy looking in the mirror without makeup and am using it almost  nightly after cleansing.  I do occasionally use a lactic acid peel but had in the past before using the oil and didn&#x27;t notice as much clearing.  Very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> My Dr recommended this for Rosascea. It has been very effective. I use a little on my face at bedtime. I have also discovered it is an excellent burn treatment--it relieves the pain and avoids blistering.</li>
    <li> I have been dealing with bouts of Rosacea for a little while now. I have tried different things - all of them non-prescription. When I read about this product, I was super hopeful that this will do the trick and I was excited that it was homeopathic. I tried the tincture on my face the same evening it arrived. What really caught me off guard was the smell. Usually I am not that picky about smells, but it smelled somewhat musty (not earthy, just musty). So, I figured if it helps my skin, I will suck it up and just deal with the smell. After a while the smell dissipated, so I was happy. However, the next morning when I woke up, I looked like I time-traveled back to my adolescent years. No, I wish it was due to the oil making me look 25 years younger, but that was unfortunately not the case. I had pimples all over my forehead, cheeks, and chin - everywhere I applied the oil. Granted, I was not expecting miracles and hoping that my red cheeks would all of a sudden be smooth and maiden looking after one application, but I surely did not expect to break out like this. I do not have sensitive skin either, so I was really caught off guard. Since this is a review about my own personal experience, I can say that this product does not work for me - not because it did not do it&#x27;s job because I did not give it a chance to work and also not because of the unusual musty smell, but because it made my skin break out really bad and I think that is worse than having flushed cheeks. Please note though, I gave this two stars because the seller was great.</li>
    <li> I do not have rosacea or eczema, I purchased this product to help soothe my acne prone skin. My skin is sensitive and tends to be oily so I was somewhat hesitant to try this at first. I&#x27;ve been using it every night before bed for 4 weeks now. Yes, it is stinky. But you only need a small amount to cover your face. This oil is very moisturizing, the first time I used it I woke up with noticeably improved skin texture. I&#x27;ve also noticed less redness in my face overall over the course of 4 weeks since. However, the main reason I purchased this product was to help reduce acne as so many people claim, and it just didn&#x27;t for me. I still get breakouts. I will still continue to use it with my night cream because I like it&#x27;s deep moisturizing properties.</li>
    <li> **Update 3/5/2015**  I have now cutback to adding only 1 drop as my face was starting to get red. It is still doing a good job of battling acne.  I have been using this oil for 4 weeks so far.  I didn&#x27;t really notice big results until the 4th week.  My skin used to have splotches of redness and some adult acne, I am 49. I have battled redness and acne ever since my teen years.  Acne was never really bad but bad enough, especially along the mouth and chin area. Since my skin is oily, I use 2 drops (will probably use more in winter) mixed with 4 drops of hyaluronic acid (HA).  I buy this from a seller on ebay who makes it from scratch and it is superb and inexpensive. HA makes it sink right in, plus it plumps up your skin...love this stuff for other beneficial reasons as well.  I have played around with the ratio. At first I used too much oil and it was breaking me out. It is so nice to look in the mirror and see clear skin with no redness.....I am not used to this at all.  It is the first time in my life I don&#x27;t need foundation to cover up anything.  I will update on this product to see if these results continue to be so incredible (crossing my fingers it does) or not.</li>
    <li> It was a little strong for my skin by itself so I started mixing just a couple of drops of it with Hyaluronic Acid Serum in my hand and then applying it to my face, neck and chest.  I then spray my face, neck and chest with distilled water I keep in a small spray bottle.  After the water has soaked into my skin I then apply a light moisturizer.  I have read that Hyaluronic Acid needs water or toner applied right after for best results and that seems to be true.  Mixing the Sea Buckthorn Oil with the Hyaluronic Acid has done wonders for my skin.  Neither have worked as well by themselves as they work together.  My skin is softer with fewer lines and just better overall complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very small bottle of oil so it will not last long.  Mixing it with the Hyaluronic Acid will make it last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also started taking Sea Buckthorn Oil and Hyaluronic Acid supplements so I am sure that is also helping.  Treating both the inside and outside of the body.  A friend told me my complexion looked brighter and more alive and that I looked well rested and asked me if I was getting more sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE -&lt;br /&gt;Downgraded two stars because of the bottle and because this oil seems to disintegrate rubber.  I stored my bottle of oil laying down in a small drawer.  When I went to use it today I noticed black stuff floating on top of the oil.  When I took a paper towel and wiped the inside of the dropper, the rubber top is disintegrating and getting into the oil.  I threw away over half a bottle because I do not want to take the chance that it could now possibly be toxic.  I don&#x27;t know if this is a common problem or if I just got a dud of a bottle but it is definitely something that everyone needs to be aware of.  The company probably needs to change to a solid hard plastic lid and include a dropper that would not be in constant contact with the oil.  I have bought essential oils that have hard plastic inserts that only allow a drop at a time to leave the bottle, so maybe that would be another option.  It concerns me that this oil will disintegrate rubber and what it may be doing to my skin that I am not aware of.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice essential oil.  I bought it because I had a severe rash and research told me that sea buckthorn oil would help.  It didn&#x27;t help the rash.  I also bought vetiver essential oil for the same rash and it did help.  However that was a much more expensive item.  If you are looking to use the oil for softening of the skin the sea buckthor works very well. I had also purchased a sea buckthorn based cleaning bar.  I use that with a few extra drops of the essential oil on my washcloth.  You will get so much sudsing from it and it is just great as an overall body oil used in this fashion.  You won&#x27;t have to apply any more than that.  It has a great clean smell and is very relaxing.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a fellow rosacea sufferer and I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and have seem some definite improvement. I can still see some faint areas of redness but it has gotten waaaay better. What was red (basically my whole face except my eyes) is now pink or normal color. I go out barefaced a lot now. I plan to keep using this oil.</li>
    <li> .Don&#x27;t see much difference from when I use it.  Argon oil works better on my ezcema.  I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 3 weeks now and have noticed a big change in my facial skin no more blackheads skin feels tighter wrinkles fading, red spider area on both cheeks are GONE and my brown spots on the sides of my face and neck are GONE.  My skin feels so soft and looks incredibly different...Younger...Im 53 years old....and the other day I was on skype with my daughter and the first thing out of her mouth was &amp;#34;Mom look at your skin it&#x27;s so beautiful no wrinkles and looks so pretty&amp;#34; I knew then this was the product for me...I will tell her in a couple more months of my secret weapon....Sea Buckthorn soap &amp; oil combo I wash my face, body, and Yes my below the shoulder hair with the Sea Buckthorn Soap in the shower everyday and follow up with the oil on my face....at night I wash my face with the soap and it removes ALL my make-up the first time including masacra and then apply the Sea Buckthorn Oil and rub it in for 20 seconds.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil on the dry patches where I have mild rosacea and it has helped with the dryness but I haven&#x27;t seen any miracles yet.  It does smell a little strange so I only wear it at night.  I&#x27;ve been trying to go natural with my beauty products so i added this to my regimen instead of the creams with chemicals.  Overall I would recommend but don&#x27;t expect any miracles.</li>
    <li> When a friend told me about this oil, I thought there is NO way I am putting any type of OIL on my face! Well, I got desperate when it was two weeks prior to my wedding and my \\&quot;hormonal acne\\&quot;  had flared out of control. I used this oil and it cleared my face over night. Nothing has worked for me to clear my skin besides a heavy birth control, which even that took 3 months to work and of course bloated me. I&#x27;ve always broken out around my chin/mouth area. I now have the easiest routine at night, I use make up remover wipes and then put my oil/cream on and that&#x27;s it! I started mixing a few drops of this oil (because it goes fast if you use it every night like me!) with the sea buckthorn daily facial cream and my skin is glowing. I love this product so much, I&#x27;d never go without it again.</li>
    <li> I cannot say how this product actually works in the long run, because I only used it one night. I could not take the smell!!! I felt like I had rubbed a barn on my face. I could barely get to sleep. And after that I just couldn&#x27;t make myself put it on again. Would be wonderful if it worked like it says, but it ended up in my garbage can.</li>
    <li> I have mild rosacea so it is hard to find a product that works. Sea buckthorn seed oil really helps calm it down it down. It doesn&#x27;t get rid of it completely, but it is about 75%-80% better. I am very happy with this product and cannot go without it. Also, when a blemish is beginning to form, put some of this on it and it will prevent it from becoming a whitehead.</li>
    <li> This is miracle oil as i call it. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year now, winter or summer.....i&#x27;m loving it. Use it just at night and feel the difference in the morning. I&#x27;m wearing less make up since using this oil. No kidding. I&#x27;m combination skin with breakouts occasionally, this product has helped with blemishes and scars. and oh not to forget you get glowing skin the morning. Try it you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Did not do much to help the redness on my cheeks.</li>
    <li> I never had acne until I turned 25 years old. Adult acne. Not a great thing to have. I am in my 40&#x27;s now and used all types of expensive acne products over the years. They just irritated my skin, dried it out and the acne never went away but came back a few days later in another spot. So I decided to try this product based on my research for an all natural maintenance (not solution) and cheaper cost. My acne is much under control using this oil. Just apply 2 drops of this orange oil (it makes your face pink after you apply it) used twice a day (morning and night). I wear makeup during the day and so the redness/pink doesn&#x27;t show. At night I just live with the pinkness. It is a small price to pay for clear skin. It sinks right in my skin and isn&#x27;t greasy. Again, LESS is more here. I have an occasional break out now. Not like I was having. Great product!</li>
    <li> so good for wrinkles, scars, scraps, cuts, stretch marks... amazing product. I used the whole time i was pregnant.</li>
    <li> I Have been suffering from rosacea and dryness in my face. This oil helped me mosturizing my skin again.&lt;br /&gt;Now it looks healthier and it is soft again. Try it, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> After reading about sea buckthorn seed oil, I finally decided to order some and try it out. I&#x27;m a man in my early 20&#x27;s and I (used to) suffer from really blotchy, oily, skin with red patches, dryness and the occasional breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the seed oil after exfoliating with a scrub cleanser. It absorbs pretty fast and then I apply my normal moisturizer and eye serum. I noticed an immediate change the next day. My skin was super clear when I woke up in the morning. It was even and there was no redness at all! I used it twice a day but eventually began using it only at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I so far haven&#x27;t had many breakouts at all and my skin texture and tone is so much better! I wish I&#x27;d purchased this months ago when I first read about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that really put me off at first is the pretty strong smell of the oil when applying it. However it dissipates after a few minutes and I&#x27;m no longer really bothered by it when applying it.</li>
    <li> I read about Sibu Beauty products on a blog touting it as a great treatment for helping combat fine lines as well as acne, especially during pregnancy. Reviews on amazon were also positive and the price was reasonable in comparison to other, less natural and potentially teratogenic products I have used in the past. I like the product. It feels nice on my skin--a little oily at first but sinks in quickly. The smell is not good, of course I am spoiled by my lovely Aveda products :) The good news is it dissipates within 45 min to an hour. I can live with that. Now for why it gets two stars. The packaging on the product I received is the WORST I have ever encountered. The dropper bottle is amber glass with a black dropper cap. The cap was broken so the dropper was loose in the cap, rendering it unable to be closed properly and DEFINITELY not travel-friendly. But even worse, a black, tar-like residue was on the edges and had begun seeping into my precious oil! I cleaned it off with cotton swabs and am hoping to buy a dropper bottle and transfer my oil. For now, it sits uncapped on my counter. I will not repurchase from this supplier if I make this a regular part of my regimen. I wonder if this was a bargain bin item resold at a lower price due to this packaging issue? In which case a gross misrepresentation of what I was to receive. My advice: buy from a known/trusted supplier or direct from Sibu Beauty!</li>
    <li> My daughter had horrible acne on her chin.  I suggested she try this.  She applied it that night and the very next morning her skin was almost totally healed.  I guess I&#x27;m going to have to order some more for myself now.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I had read that it was good for red skin patches. This did absolutely nothing, and it smells bad to boot.</li>
    <li> Im writing this after 3 days of usage. There is a noticeable difference to my rosacea. Im going to keep at it. I didnt give it a 4 stars because it does not smell nice at all. If you&#x27;re going to use it before bed do it at least 30 minutes before because it is oily. You only need a drop or 2 per cheek or wherever you need to use it. My 75 year old mother wants to try it on her wrinkle(as in ONE on her forehead...lucky girl)so I&#x27;ll pick her up a bottle. I&#x27;ve never written a review about a skin product before and I brought this based on the reviews here so thank you!</li>
    <li> When I started using this product, my face had red outbreaks and the &amp;#34;blushing&amp;#34; effects of rosacea (as diagnosed by my dermatologist).  This buckthorn seed oil applied directly to my face twice a day (morning &amp; evening after facial cleansing) is working as well, if not better for me, than the $200 Metrogel 1%.  I would much rather use a natural, less expensive alternative that does the job. This does.....for me!</li>
    <li> This oil is very healing. I used it on a red raised patch along my hairline.  In a few days it was completely healed.  It is great for lines and wrinkles too.  It is very high in antioxidants.</li>
    <li> sea buckthorn oil is amazing, it absorbs well and leaves a lovely glow. I have sea buckthorn fruit oil also which is very orange (pale skinned peeps stay away), this is lovely as it&#x27;s not as orange and can be mixed with rosehip seed oil (same situation, rosehip fruit oil is more orange) to make a lovely glowy oil serum.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! It helps with breakouts so much without drying like you would get with say an acne cream. The only con is the scent. It&#x27;s not terrible, but it&#x27;s not pleasant. You get used to it though. All in all I have already purchased more than 2x &amp; I can&#x27;t see any reason not to continue doing so in the future.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and am using this on it.  Don&#x27;t know yet how it&#x27;s going to work - will take a while.</li>
    <li> Be careful with this if you have oily skin. At first, it seemed to help with the pimples but after using for a week, my entire forehead exploded. I had to shell out money for a facial with extractions to clear everything out. Needless to say I won&#x27;t be using this anymore.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product because I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about Sea Buckthorn Seed Oil, but I did not have a pleasant experience upon using it.  It actually made my face break out but, even worse than that, the smell was just horrible.  I forced myself to use it for a few days, not wanting to give up on it, but I finally just threw it away.  The smell, together with the breakout, made me feel as though I was abusing my skin (and my nose!).  I&#x27;m glad some people have had good results with it, but for me, it was a no-go.</li>
    <li> I really like this oil. It feels nice on my skin and I believe it helps with acne as well. It&#x27;s lightweight yet moisturizing. I find it soothing and look forward to putting it on in the evening. I don&#x27;t believe it would work too well in the AM. I&#x27;ve also mixed with some coconut oil and used as an all over moisturizing cream at night and have liked that as well. I&#x27;ve purchased this a couple of times and plan on buying more when it is gone!</li>
    <li> Discovered this product accidentally while researching for rosacea. Within 2 weeks of applying it along with sea salt treatment,I saw good result. All I add now is a drop of this oil to my moisturizer at night &amp; by morning can see the difference. Just a drop is all you need as this oil is very potent and powerful.any skin problem, sea buckthorn oil will take care. Bonus: the fine lines shrinking!!</li>
    <li> This product came highly recommended by a mail order company whose employees test out everything they sell. This is supposed to work miracles on your skin for age spots, flaky skin, to wrinkles. A cure all for everything going on with your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I had been using the oil on &amp; off for a few months after purchasing it from the above company mentioned &amp; decided to try it full time. The price from Amazon was great &amp; I combined it with the sea buckthorn facial soap. It&#x27;s been over a month &amp; my skin has become drier with the soap &amp; the oil has created cystic acne.&lt;br /&gt;For me, it&#x27;s a total bomb, but since everyone is different, you really have to try products out for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for this oil since my skin matches the type this oil is purported to help.</li>
    <li> very good thanks..........</li>
    <li> I originally bought it for my gums which did help. Then I started using a few drops on my face and wow.  It softens my skin keeps it hydrated.</li>
    <li> I have pretty sensitive skin as most people with rosacea. As soon as I received this product I applied it only to the areas with the most redness and I did notice some acne but I assumed it was because it is an oil and can block pores but after a few days I decided to use it on my entire face. After a couple days of doing this I noticed that my lips felt chapped and after I took a shower in the evening I noticed many many tiny bumps all over my nose and cheeks. This might work for some people but not at all for me.</li>
    <li> I can see that this has worked for many people, but it didn&#x27;t have any affect for me as far as I can tell.  YMMV.</li>
    <li> Great price, although didn&#x27;t last long.  Good product, Quick and easy to order and receive.  This was cheaper than Sprouts</li>
    <li> Have used this in the past and it worked great. This time it came with the plastic stopper melted and there was black plastic all mixed in with the oil. Yuck.</li>
    <li> Cleared up all of my acne during a break out. Really amazing stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Purchased a cheaper brand of oil which includes the berries &amp; seeds and did not see a difference in my skin. Stick with this one, people.&lt;br /&gt;This does stain so be especially careful about the neckline of your shirts when changing.</li>
    <li> Great product and it really makes my skin smooth. I use it before I go to bed and my skin is so soft the next day.&lt;br /&gt;No irritation, just great results.</li>
    <li> Words cannot be enough to describe the wonders it has made on my face. I have dry skin with rosacea and acne. I use this once on a daily basis after I clean my face and rub in circular motion. I&#x27;ve seen less redness and my acne has diminish to a point I can say I have no active acne but I do have red scars I am dealing with. I use this product and will continue to use it because it goes so well with my face.</li>
    <li> A little bit thick. I only use one drop and blend into my moisturizer. Seems like its too much for my skin and seems like it does more to clog rather than clear</li>
    <li> if you are looking for a miracle this product works surprisingly well on melasma.  I have very light brown spots remaining on my cheek bones but i have only used the product 3 times.  I like using it at night best, I tried mixing it with my facial moisturizer during the day but I don&#x27;t like thinking someone may think I stink.  It is not oily at all, it actually feels silky.  I just wish it didn&#x27;t smell.  Its not overbearing in fact its kind of fishy herby, more herby.  Not sure how to describe it, but it dissipates after an hour or so.  I almost wonder if you could mix it with some vanilla or peony essential oil safe for your skin or something to mask the smell.  But otherwise, it&#x27;s a great affordable little treasure.</li>
    <li> i use at night on my whole face.  helps acne and my skin tone. it works better than any oil i have tried and i have tried a lot. a slight smell that you will get used to after a few uses. i have never been able to smell it again. it does not seem to clog my pores like other oils. a little goes a long way. its a very good product and worth the price</li>
    <li> This Oil is the best!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any effect at all using this, and the smell is similar to linseed oil, not real pleasant, kind of odd.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i can&#x27;t it on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worry is to know how to use it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am sorry~</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read some of the reviews of this product in which users were less than satisfied with their results. It seems that they aren&#x27;t using the best cleanser before the oil. The combination of Sea Buckthorn Seed Oil and Chang Sheng Herbal Rejuvenating Beauty Soap may give them better results; it has certainly worked for me. I no longer have enlarged pores, blackheads, redness, dry or oily patches, or acne that has to be controlled with Pantothenic Acid/Biotin capsules. My skin looks great without makeup and the improvement just keeps coming. For anyone who hasn&#x27;t had the results they expected from the Sea Buckthorn Seed Oil alone I strongly suggest they add Chang Sheng Herbal Rejuvenating Beauty Soap to their routine.&lt;br /&gt;Someone mentioned the strong scent of the oil. It is a funky smell, I admit. But the scent fades after application and after using it for a while you may not notice it as much. It&#x27;s a small price to pay for clear and beautiful skin.</li>
    <li> After reading all the great reviews on Sea Buckthorn I decided to try it to help eliminate the occasional hormonal acne that I have. Worst product I have ever used! It caused me to break out in cystic acne which I never had before and they would not go away! I then purchased M2 Skin Refining 20% serum along with the M2 Moisturizer and these 2 products helped calm my skin down and I rarely break out now after using the M2 products.</li>
    <li> I just got this in the mail, and I put it on. It smells so bad, I&#x27;m not even sure if I&#x27;m going to be able to find out if it works or not. The smell is VERY strong and VERY unpleasant!</li>
    <li> I purchased this once and it seemed fine but after going through the entire bottle it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything. I bought it again and this time it wasn&#x27;t organic, and it smells like diarrhea. There&#x27;s no other way I can describe the smell. I put some on my skin anyway (ha), and it turned it orange. It was maybe just a bad bottle this time but it really is much less than worthless.</li>
    <li> I love it. It works. Everyone should get this product. It is a little costly. Thats it for now.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> This is the ultimate product for your face if used at night. It clears up any ongoing red patches and is great on any blemish or small scrape.  I used this product while I was in Tibet/China and never thought I would be able to find it here in the states.</li>
    <li> I first tried this about two months ago. I love it. Cleanses without over drying. Works well with my prescribed ERY 1% gel.</li>
    <li> I am extreamly happy with the results of this product. I am 35 and my son 15. I have light acne and my son has heavy acne.  For me, it has curbed my accasional breakouts and stops large zits when they start.  I use both day and night.  For my son, i can see a noticable difference, but this is not the answer for him as he just has too much. So, my recommendation is if you have light acne this is your answer.  Along with the oil, i use the Sea Buckthorn suppliments, Aubry Organics Sea Buckthorn &amp; Cucumber toner and african black soap.</li>
    <li> I use this as ONE of the ingrediants in my homemade daily face scrub/clenser. My face has been the CLEAREST and best looking it&#x27;s EVERY looked and I think I have this product as ONE of the prodcuts to thank for it. I break out (not bad) but bade enough where I HAVE to wear make up. I use sea of buckthorn sead, tamanu oil, olive oil, lemon juice, coffee, and sugar as my scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is MORE clear.&lt;br /&gt;If I do breakout it&#x27;s already healed by the next morning-less visable, smaller.&lt;br /&gt;My scars from POST breakouts are going away.&lt;br /&gt;Skin appears to be brighter and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;My skin tone has evened out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t even have to wear makeup now!</li>
    <li> The oil seemed like it helped my skin but was such a small amount that it didn&#x27;t go very far.</li>
    <li> This made my Face break out and more red. I used it for 3 days and then quit. As my face would turn redder shortly after using it.</li>
    <li> lovely and works great on my oily skin improving texture.  I love the smell too.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this item for my grandson to use on warts. It work for a while but warts came back.</li>
    <li> I regularly purchase Sibu products, both through Amazon and sibubeauty.com. I am very pleased with everything I have tried. This oil is fantastic. I have used it on skin tags, rashes, as a serum before facial moisturizer, etc. It makes your skin feel better while leaving behind a healthy glow. It also works well on eye wrinkles and age spots. Sea buckthorn seed oil is a multi tasking product that I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> This did not work for my skin condition.  I did not notice anything but it made my skin oily and I used it for 1 month.</li>
    <li> I use this with my jojoba oil for my face. I have been using It for about 2 1/2 weeks now, no bad reaction to report. will continue to look for improvements.</li>
    <li> Now this stuff is just wonderful!!! It does exactly what it should and then some!!! Im very fair and as a teenager I tried my hardest to tan naturally. So of course I have some red spots on my chest, and shoulders and arms. (Sad face) I didnt really expect this product to do what it did so when I saw my red spots fading I washed my mirror to make sure my eyes were right! It absolutely was true! I put this product where its needed once in the morning and once before bed every single day! Ive seen a dramatic difference and will buy more when I run out. Ive had this for about 8 months now and am only about half way down. id recommend this to any and every person with redness issues. Its not harmful or irritating to the skin like all bleaches or even some natural remedies out there so you have close to no worries with this product!!!</li>
    <li> I have rosacea and this product seemed to help my outbreak. It&#x27;s mild and has helped the redness in my face decrease. I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My mom and grandma love this stuff. You can definitely see a difference in their rosacea.  They love how smooth their faces have become.  It has definitely smoothed out all their deep and fine wrinkles as well.</li>
    <li> I actually rub this on my butt to smooth out the skin. It gives it a really nice sheen. I teach yoga and some times when I do hot yoga we prefer the nude. This product really helps to keep my self confidence high.</li>
    <li> Im not sure if this reverses the effect of rosacea however it doesn&#x27;t aggravate my skin, I&#x27;ve had no breakout either</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this to anyone that has any kind of skin problem. It has cleared up my Rosacea which really worked.</li>
    <li> This stuff is seriously amazing! My skin has never looked better!!</li>
    <li> As a teenager I&#x27;ve always had a really red face and oily skin with breakouts and acne. As a grew older, the acne diminished on it&#x27;s own but the redness worsened and I found out that I had rosacea. During the recent winter, I started to get peely, bumpy red skin that looked like hives on my face. I was a little wary about this oil actually working but after reading all of the reviews from people who also have rosacea - and also due to my desperation - I decided to try it. This stuff works like a charm. Not only did it help with the scaly looking skin and redness, it made my whole face silky smooth and even helped with the little bit of acne I still have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of warning - put it on every night before bed and try not to skip days. Every time I skipped a day, I noticed my problem starting to crop back up and I do so badly want to skip days because as nice as this stuff is, it stinks badly and doesn&#x27;t make well for cuddle time with your significant other. I&#x27;ve heard some people put it under their makeup during the day but I couldn&#x27;t stand to do that. It smells and just feels really oily (obviously) and takes a while to sink into your skin which is why it&#x27;s just better to use at night when you sleep. If you are having serious facial skin problems, I highly suggest this. My face feels amazing and I&#x27;m not so embarrassed to walk out in public!</li>
    <li> I love and use most sibu products and the oil isn&#x27;t any different than the rest of their products....they work well.</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with this product. In the last year or so I started having redness appearing on my cheeks and cystic acne that I could not seem to get rid of. With some research online, I thought that rosacea was most likely the culprit. I ordered this along with the Sibu Beauty Cleansing Face and Body Bar Sea Buckthorn, which is also available on Amazon. I have been using the two together now for 5 days and my Rosacea is barely there. There is still a small reddish spot on one of my cheeks, but I&#x27;m sure it will be gone in a few days with continued use. I&#x27;m not sure if it was just this product or the combination of the two, but I am so happy! I hated looking in the mirror and seeing those awful red patches every day, now I can actually brave the world cover up free!</li>
    <li> I really like this item because I put it on before bed on my minimal acne scars. I have been using for about a month and have seen great results.</li>
    <li> This product reduced my rosacea by 90%.  It reduced my dry skin.  I use it morning and evening.  I&#x27;ve been through mult prescribed creams with little improvement.  This is wonderful</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;m not a big believer in homeopathic remedies for medical problems. But I bought some of this oil after reading all the rave reviews about it helping rosacea.  I have PP rosacea (not just the flushing kind) which is frequently mistaken for &#x27;adult acne&#x27;.  My dermatologist prescribed a well known face cream for rosacea (rhymes with it) as well as an antibiotic (which also rhymes with rosacea).  The antibiotic was really the only thing that helped, being about 75% effective.  The face cream was marginally helpful and stung slightly, which I worried was going to increase the redness.  Even with the antibiotic, I would have break outs.  Which lead me to the sea buckthorn oil.  I began applying it to my problem areas every night (my forehead and cheeks) after washing my face and patting it dry.  To me the oil does not smell fishy or bad.  It&#x27;s a familiar smell that I can&#x27;t quite place, but I&#x27;d say it smells mostly like a wet wood.  It is a dark orange color, so putting on in the morning may be tricky if you don&#x27;t want people to wonder why your face is slightly orange (don&#x27;t worry, it washes off cleanly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results of applying it once a day before bed were pretty stunning.  The break outs stopped immediately.  It&#x27;s been so effective that I&#x27;ve now stopped the antibiotic and after 6 days, my skin is still clear.  Like another reviewer said, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever be without this oil now.  Truly remarkable.  I have tried only a few other oils, like coconut, but it seemed to cause more breakouts.  So I can&#x27;t say for sure if another oil wouldn&#x27;t work as well (something like jojoba?) but without a doubt, this stuff has made a huge improvement.</li>
    <li> I have had rosacea for 10 years mainly on my temples. I started using this oil once a day for a month. I can really see and feel a major difference. I highly recommend this product. It does smell a little funky when you first apply it. but it goes away</li>
    <li> I use this every day! I would recommend this to everyone.  It does not make you break out, rather it hydrates your skin and makes it soft</li>
    <li> I bought this, 2 bottles. i noticed it sinks well into my skin. my skin absorbs it well. i love how it feels on  my skin. but a for fading spots, i didnt see any change. i might say it actually darken my face. the main purpose of buy it was to lighten my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i cant say any negative thing about it. its a good oil though expensive. but lightening spots, i dont think so.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this is doing any change to my skin.  It&#x27;s pleasant to add to other oil.  Light color because it&#x27;s the seed oil and not the fruit.</li>
    <li> Package arrived, container was sealed. Upon taking off the seal on the little bottle, there was nothing but emptiness inside.</li>
    <li> Just received today.  The seal was broken and the product did not smell the same as other bottles that I have bought in the past from other companies.</li>
    <li> This stuff is da bomb!!!  My pores have all but disappeared. It has cleared my skin as well as tighten up my wrinkles. It&#x27;s amazing!!</li>
    <li> I get those red crusty precancerous spots on my face; this oil rubbed on the spot each day eventually clears them away.It&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and ordered this product. This is a great moisturizer and good for acne scars.</li>
    <li> At first I thought this product was going to be amazing after reading all the amazing reviews. And for awhile I thought it was working, I even bought a second bottle to continue the use because I thought it was really going to work. However, I think it was just too much oil on my skin because I got the worst breakout of my life all over my forehead and chin. I felt like I was in junior high again - my breakouts were so bad that makeup just wouldnt cover it. So frankly this product didn&#x27;t work for me. I have oily skin to begin with so that might be why this oil product worstened my acne.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this is worth commenting on.  I have what I would call severe rosacea.  My skin is always red and you can see the tiny blood vessels that look so aggravated. I&#x27;m early 40&#x27;s and have not been at all interested in the traditional treatment methods for this condition.  I don&#x27;t want to take medication for this problem - so basically thought I would just give this oil a try.  I told my daughter about it while I was waiting on the product to arrive.  She is 13 and recently asked me what was wrong with my face (bless her heart - she wasn&#x27;t being mean, just curious about the condition because she knew there was something going on).  This morning, after using the oil just 2 days (4 drops at night and just 2 drops mixed into my normal moisturizer for the daytime), my daughter said, \\&quot;Mom, your face looks better already.\\&quot;  She said it was still a little pink, but nothing like it was and she&#x27;s right.  It feels so much better already and I can&#x27;t wait to see what continued use will do.  I also have problems with large pores and acne that just won&#x27;t go away - I mean that I always seem to have the same issues in the same spots - those places are also better - not gone, but remarkably better.  It&#x27;s really one of those \\&quot;you don&#x27;t believe it till you see it\\&quot; kind of things.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to try it - I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s like anything else that it might work for some and not for others, but it is definitely working for me!</li>
    <li> I bought this oil after realizing some of the most expensive and effective skincare products come with sea buckthorn berry oil. I actually had meant to purchase the berry oil but ended up with the seed oil. However, I am more than satisfied. Berry oil has very strong orangey-color and can tint your face. That will wash off, but I wanted to use it during the day, so seed oil is actually the better alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell (it kind of smells like seaweed?), but it will eventually go away. It won&#x27;t stink up the whole room or anything. I mixed it 1:2 with organic grape seed oil and put a few drops of Lavender and Chamomile essential oils to make my own serum moisturizer. I believe it helped me clear up some of the T-zone inflammation, but can&#x27;t be 100% sure since there are also other factors involved. I have combination-sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my skin as a preventive measure against wrinkles, and for my scalp for healthier hair. It absorbs quickly and not greasy. However, before I was able to see any benefits of this product on myself I saw how well it worked for my cat. My cat always suffered from some sort of skin irritation on her ears. She would scratch them so badly that they would bleed, scar, heal and the cycle would just repeat. It would stop for a while and come back. I was unable to show her to vet because she hates vet&#x27;s office and acts like a maniac, impossible to get her there without anesthesia and I don&#x27;t want to do that to her unless it is absolutely necessary (I had to do it once before and it is not pretty). I only use natural holistic food, natural litter and no chemicals in the house so I could never figure out what caused it. Anyway, this time when she started scratching her ears I started applying a drop of this oil on each ear in the morning and night and by the end of the week everything healed and I noticed that as soon as I applied oil she was no longer scratching her ears. It worked wonders for her and I&#x27;m absolutely happy and satisfied with the results. Even if it does nothing else for me I love it and will keep it around the house for my cat. Obviously it works for animal&#x27;s skin too.</li>
    <li> My facial skin is extremely sensitive so there are VERY few products I can use on it. I had been having problems with my previous moisturizer, so decided to give this one a try. I have used it mixed with a few drops of olive oil and recently (the past 2 months) have switched to just using it by itself. My sensitive skin has not had any problems with it - no break outs, no rashes, swelling, itching or pain. And my skin is softer and smoother and the color seems more even recently. I&#x27;m not sure if the even coloring is just wishful thinking, or the fact that I am so very happy with this oil because of a smoother face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update June 2013** - My bf thought he might be allergic to the oil because of the strong smell immediately after I applied. I stopped using it for a month (left the rest of my regimen the same) and my skin went back to the rough, patchy, dry feeling skin that I had before I started using this product. I started using it again just once a day, and noticed immediate improvement again and have finally figured out how to use it twice a day when he isn&#x27;t around. Everyone has commented on how much healthier I look. It has (again) improved the texture (now soft and smooth) and appearance (by ridding me of the patchy/blotchyness and gives me a &#x27;glow&#x27;). I won&#x27;t ever go without it again. I am back to replenish my supply and buying it for my mom who has had rosacea for years.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t remember why I first purchased Sea Buckthorn Seed Oil, but after using it for a few days, I realized that it improved my roscea! I&#x27;ve been using this everyday now for over a year and my roscea is completely gone!I tried everything and this really works! If I was going to a desert island and could only take one thing, Sea Buckthorn Seed Oil would be it!</li>
    <li> I used this to help with acne. It seemed to work okay and the oil quickly absorbed. I couldn&#x27;t seem to get over the smell though.</li>
    <li> Good stuff but be forewarned, it will stain your clothes, towels and sheets. I think it is worth the trouble but still have to be careful.</li>
    <li> I rarely post reviews but have to share this with fellow rosacea suffers.  My rosacea can get significant.  The dermatologist has prescribed all sorts of expensive prescription washes and lotions, but nothing has ever worked.  At all.  And that snake oil is mighty expensive.  I have a prescription sulfer wash that&#x27;s $40 a bottle and has done nothing for the redness...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago the rosacea grew worse.  I&#x27;d really be taken aback by what I saw in the mirror; I seemed to be going from pink to maroon.  I had little bumps all over my forehead and the whole face was splotchy.  My dermatologist recommended IPL laser, which is expensive and came with mixed reviews.  I decided, as a last ditch effort, to search Amazon.  Whatever did we do before Amazon and the fabulous reviews found here?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saw the reviews for the sea buckthorn and bought the product.  Yes - it smells.  But it&#x27;s a plant based bad smell which really isn&#x27;t offensive.  I put a few drops on at night without high hopes.  It&#x27;s an excellent moisturizer.  My dry, Fitzgerald 1 skin-type loved it.  By the second or third day, the results were dramatic.  The pink was (and so far is) gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure:  I&#x27;m using the TriDerma Rosacea skin wash, not regular soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is no longer red.  It&#x27;s so white (NOT PINK!) that it takes me by surprise when I look in the mirror.  This morning I thought to myself that my makeup was covering the pink really well then realized I wasn&#x27;t wearing any makeup.  It&#x27;s that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it took five years off my face.  I&#x27;m 46 and feel like I have fewer wrinkles.  My skin tone is much much better, and the red is gone.  Could it be that just the red and the bumps are gone and the rest is just in my imagination?  I&#x27;m not sure, but my skin looks terrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE Feb 24 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for almost three months and my skin has NEVER looked better.  The wrinkles are gone- or let&#x27;s at least say GREATLY diminished.  I&#x27;ve actually been asked if I&#x27;ve had \\&quot;work done\\&quot; to my face.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> love it and it was a great price really helps with the Rosacia.  I would recommend this to anyone who has skin issues!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this oil. It is light, moisturizing and the smell isn&#x27;t strong. It is one of my go to oils for my skin care regime. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the bottle is so small. Other than that I have no problems with this product.</li>
    <li> In trying to clean up my diet and doing reading, I came across information about oil cleansing on the face.  Sounded crazy to me, but I kept reading and then started taking notes.  Then I saw sea buckthorn oil mentioned and how it was good for rosacea.  Well, that was one of my problems and previous other purchases I made that claimed to help it really didn&#x27;t.  I was also concerned with long lists of chemical names on my soaps and lotions.  Why did my skin still get flaky after supposedly washing it (with Cetaphil) and applying expensive night creams?  I took a chance and ordered sea buckthorn oil as well as tea tree oil, argan oil and rose hip serum.  WOW.  What a combo!  I don&#x27;t have acne, but had some pore issues, some rosacea, uneven skin tone, flaking around nose.  Hated seeing my face in one of those magnifying makeup mirrors.  I have been using the 4 oils mentioned above for several weeks now, but mainly the sea buckthorn at night.  It has a slightly orangish color to it, and supposedly can stain, but I haven&#x27;t seen any bizarre coloring of my skin, if anything, it might make it look slightly tanner, which is okay with me.  Still, I have been amazed at the change in my skin.  It feels softer, the pores have shrunk, the flakiness is gone, and it does seem less redder, not that I had a bad case of rosacea, just redder cheeks.  I think slowly but surely my skin is improving, old gunk getting flushed/cleaned out.  In the mornings I grab the mirror first thing to see what is going on with my skin, and I have not been disappointed.  I also wash now with [[ASIN:B001CMV8FG Desert Essence Thoroughly Clean Face Wash Refill, 32-Ounce]].  Got rid of my chemical laden Cetaphil which didn&#x27;t seem to help me.  These items all cost less than fancy creams and lotions with their pretty packages.&lt;br /&gt;Also check out [[ASIN:B0014UAHQW NOW Foods Rose Hip Seed Oil, 1 ounce]], [[ASIN:B008MOPBQ4 Aura Cacia Argan Skin Care Oil Certified Organic - 1 fl oz]] and [[ASIN:B000E1VWA2 Aura Cacia Tea Tree Essential Oil, 0.5 Ounce Bottle]].

    <li> This is a wonderful product .  I have tried so many other lotions and creams but this one provided a clear complexion at a very reasonable price.  I have only used this for 3 days and can already see the difference.  I have wrinkles, rosacea, etc that I am trying to remedy and this product addressed all three.  Imagine that - a product that actually works!</li>
    <li> This is supposed to help with rosacea, it didn&#x27;t do anything if anything it made it worse. I would put on my other prescription medicines and my face would look better and then after I put this on my cheeks turned red!</li>
    <li> Yes Seabuckthorn is great for the skin and scalp.  Better than anything you can buy that is man made.  It smells like wet wood or whole wheat pasta.  Not sure why people are complaining about the smell, it&#x27;s really not even bad, I find it pleasant.</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to work for my menopause skin but it didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not the product, you know how picky menopause skin can be!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It seems to get rid of brown spots and old acne marks. It also prevents acne. I&#x27;m not sure it gets rid of fine lines. Although it seems to soften fine lines but not completely get rid of them.  I&#x27;ve used this for almost 2 months and I really love this stuff. I have some on its way and I had to get 2 bottles because the bottles are very small and I run out to quick. The value.is reasonable because I went to GNC to buy more and it cost $39 but it was made into a serum and I prefer the oil plus I can get it cheaper on Amazon. So here I wait for my order. I hope it gets here soon cause I&#x27;m out and I use this stuff morning &amp; evening to prevent acne and it definitely helps!</li>
    <li> I have used this oil for a while.  It helped with my dry skin and eczema. It was relatively inexpensive too.  I would recommend it for anyone with problems with dry skin or eczema.  Its gentle on skin too. Very Happy!!</li>
    <li> Read all the wonderful reviews about the product and really was looking forward to trying it. It did absolutely nothing to reduce redness. It actually irritated the skin more and caused more redness. Very disappointing. The smell is also really overpowering and unpleasant.</li>
    <li> Great price, great product. I would recomnmend this product for acne problem.&lt;br /&gt;My son used this and had great result</li>
    <li> 2/19/2014....I have been using this oil on a pretty bad flare up of my rosacea. The breakout and lesions were very unsightly. I have been using this 3 times a day and my roseacea lesions/sores are 85% gone.!!! I am so happy with this product....so far....I am like a lot of the reviewers who do not ever put any kind of oil on my face ...I have never been able to do that without having a major breakout of blemishes within 2 to 3 days...Tried coconut oil which isn&#x27;t supposed to clog pores but it did not work for me. it seems if a blemish might be coming on and the next day is gone after I apply the buckthorn oil. I am proceeding with caution with this oil just because of my sensitive mid fifties skin issues...I will update next week after the 2 week mark.</li>
    <li> I am a very active Amazon shopper, so much so that I frequently get on here to read reviews before purchasing a new product that has caught my eye in store (which was the case with this Sibu Buckthorn seed oil). However, I rarely if ever actually submit a review on skin products myself. Why? Because I rarely find a product that I swear by and I am not one to throw around &amp;#34;AMAZING&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;THE BEST THING EVER&amp;#34; very lightly. As someone who&#x27;s spent the last year battling with skin issues, can relate to the psychologic stress of seeking out solutions and not getting results, I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s fair. Everyone has different issues and will respond differently. Personally, I am very excited about current results and the potential for finding a regiment that will continue to work in the future. I had skin issues in high school and was put on accutane. Through college, I had my skin managed and started getting into making my own face wash with oils. Two years ago I went backpacking overseas for one year. I lived in the sun, like in the outback, asian beaches 24/7. I really went all natural, humidity kept my skin moist and salt water and sun served as a natural astringent. I was eating all natural, whole foods. My skin really looked great. Then, I moved back to the US and within a month my skin just, well it went crazy. It completely flared up and I mean, BAD break outs, cystic acne, hormonal acne, dry patches and sun damage. It was like something I&#x27;d never experienced, my homemade face wash was of no help and I had to switch to chemical products that dried me out terribly and lead to redness and flaking and more breakouts due my skin over producing oil to counter the dryness. I sought out help from a Derma who put me on Tret.,OBAJI  brightening serum, and OBAJI acne face wash treatment. Which made things so bad that I actually didn&#x27;t leave the house for nearly 4 days. The result of everything was red acne scaring, hyperpigmentation, broken capillaries, and some rough patches and uneven skin texture. I have had 2 IPL treatments iand an ematrix in the last year and half which has given some results but not fully corrected the damage nor prevented acne. If this experience has taught me anything, there is not a one size fits all solution and things must be managed internally and externally. Slowly, after extensive research I have found a regiment that is working for ME. I want to share what I am doing in hopes that maybe those in a similar battle w/ their skin may be able find a resolution. 1. Fatty Acids- incorporate them into your diet. I take hempseed oil and/or avocado oil daily and enjoy the benefits of both on my skin/hair applied topically. Hempseed is excellent for anti- inflammatory purposes. It has helped with acne but I find it a little drying. I know a lot of people on here are using sea buckthorn for eczema. I have read that some have success with hempseed oil for treating eczema in addition to acne. Also, I have ordered Buckthorn berry oil capsules after my results with the topical oil and face wash. 2. Maca- hormonal balancing that has helped with those monthly breakouts. 3. Sibu Beauty Sea Buckthorn Facial Cleanser- this really has helped with balance 4. Sibu Beauty Sea Buckthorn Oil - Absolutely has reduced redness smoothed out around my eyes. 5. Radha Beauty Rosehip Oil  100% cold pressed - natural Retin- A for wrinkle reduction 6. TruSkin Organic Vitamin C serum - This is for discoloration, but caution Vit. C is known to cause breakouts in some acne sufferers. 7. Ederm Tea Tree Oil and Vitamin E- I DO swear by this stuff. It is excellent for breakouts as long as you don&#x27;t mind the smell. I&#x27;ve been using it so long that I actually enjoy it.  At night time, I use a small a bit of hempseed oil to wipe down my face and remove make up. The anti-inflammatory properties are helpful with acne and I feel as though I&#x27;ve noticed the last few months that the skin around my eyes and cheeks to be look a more full and plump. I think this is a result of the omegas. Then, follow up with the Sibu Face Cleanser. As I mentioned before, hempseed alone (or even mixed with other oils: jojoba, coconut, etc.) wasn&#x27;t achieving that perfect balance. Sibu Face Cleaner really was that missing component, it really is excellent in terms of leaving you feeling clean and not being at all harsh. While my skin is still wet with warm water, I take 3 drops of Sibu Seed oil, placing one on my index, middle and ring finger. Then, rosehip oil- 3 drops on top of Sibu drops. Take corresponding three fingers of other hand and tap the oils to transfer oil over.  I quickly tap both hands on each side of my forehead and on each cheek, excess is massaged around my eyes. I massage my forehead and pull the oil down around to my cheeks and come down around my jaw line to neck. It is absorbed as the water dries. A little goes a long way, don&#x27;t ever do it. The 1-2 drops of Vitamin C serum in select  dark spots.  I follow up with a bit of eDerm Tea Tree oil + Vit. E. This on a cotton swab 10- 15 minutes later. Tea tree is the best thing for my break outs (it dried them out and I noticed improvement as soon as I started incorporating it into my regiment again). Usually eliminates them before they even surface. The Vit. E is great for moisture and healing. I typically do one more drop of Sibu Oil and again put it around my eyes and acne scars. It has improved lines and texture around my eyes even better than the Rosehip Oil.  I like to follow up with a small pump of  Obagi Clenziderm Therapeutic Moisturizer (noncomedogenic, glycerin-rich) which really locks in the moisture. In the mornings, I skip the hemp seed oil and cut the one pump of  Obagi Clenziderm in half and incorporate a small pump of Loreal Vitamin E + spf 15.  I have honestly had results, I am genuinely happy with my skin. It has balance, I am not breaking out, and slowly the acne scars are beginning to to fade. Again, this has been a process of trail and error for about a year and it has been about really changing my life style too (it goes beyond just eating more omegas). Health and healthy skin starts on the inside and it certainly improves further when one finds the correct topical solutions. That one, all encompassing, magical product that cures everything has still eluded me. However, this combination of products has produced true results. The Buckthorn seed oil and face wash are definitely a fixtures in my daily routine. It has reduced the redness of scaring, balanced my skin and eliminated the dry flaking. This in combination with several other products have improved my appearance and hopefully continues to!</li>
    <li> This the second time I have ordered this product and will do so again. It&#x27;s that good .</li>
    <li> Works like a charm! Reduces redness a lot! The dropper works perfect as well! And it hasn&#x27;t made me break out in acne at all! I will probly use this the rest of my life</li>
    <li> This oil is wonderful for all kinds of skin conditions.  It is is a light oil so your skin quickly absorbs it.</li>
    <li> I have had rosacea for probably 15 years. Mild, on my cheeks, but still noticeable. Nothing previously had worked and I thought Sea Buckthorn would be like all the other products with possibly more irritation than improvement. But a read through of the amazon reviews posted made me give it a go. I am bowled over. On one side of my face the rosacea is fading fast. On the more stubborn cheek, the changes are dramatic. My skin feels like skin, not a dead/dry patch.  It actually feels softer. On waking each of the last three mornings I look to see what has happened overnight,  The angry discoloration I see when I peer in the magnifying mirror has decreased. Thank you sibu. Thank you homeopathic medicine... Thank you ancient wisdom of people who first gathered sea buckthorn and found out it worked for rosacea. Yes, it smells a bit. Yes, I still have rosacea. But I now have something that I will use twice a day to keep it at bay. Many thanks to all the reviewers as well (the good and the bad). It&#x27;s wonderful to be able to make informed judgements about products based on user experiences. So also, thank you amazon!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, it makes my skin feel wonderful!</li>
    <li> the bottle material is so cheap, the black residues from cap deteriorated and dropped into the bottle, mixing it with the actual oil, omgosh, so disgusting, its going back.</li>
    <li> no breakouts, or adverse reactions at all.  not too oily either.  smell isn&#x27;t great, but not that bad!  : )</li>
    <li> Sea Buckthorn Seed Oil is great for any skin irritation. It is a soothing night face oil. Just a few drops a night will do.</li>
    <li> I got this sea buckthorn seed oil for rosacea based on the reviews I read.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my face for about six months now and my face has cleared up and my skin is so soft.  I am so happy with my complexion after using this oil.  I never want to be without it!</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase some Sea Buckthorn Seed Oil in order to help control my rosacea symptoms. This product is a great alternative to other products, especially since it is not as expensive. It even helps moisturize my skin! I don&#x27;t mind the smell. Honestly, if it works, then that is all that matters. I have used Prosacea as well. Prosacea does work, however, it can be drying which would usually cause me to be extra oily. Overall, after using it for 2 weeks, I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I expected a product that would moisturize and help my face skin stop flaking and peeling in certain parts. It made it worse. I did not like the smell which lasted a long time. The smell reminded me of plumbing putty.The product may be good for other skin issues which I will try to further test it. Franlkly fresh cut aloe leaf out my garden works faily well to repair.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product so don&#x27;t know if it actually works or not.&lt;br /&gt;It is orange in color so I was worried about it yellowing my skin but it seems to fade within the hour. The other thing is that&lt;br /&gt;it smells but this also fades and especially goes away when I apply makeup over it. I am hoping that I get the results&lt;br /&gt;that Dr. Oz said it would give but only time will tell.</li>
    <li> The oil seems like a fine quality. The problem is that after two weeks the rubber part of the dropper broke off from the top. I&#x27;ve been unable to contact the seller to get a replacement dropper. If you want this oil there may be better vendors  (packagers) to buy it from.</li>
    <li> I started using this product when I was looking for alternatives to pricey prescriptions for rosacea.  This works will in conjunction with the Tri-derma facial redness repair product. I use both and have had far fewer flare ups and facial redness.</li>
    <li> This product was shipped very quickly and I am happy with the product.  I saw the Dr Oz segment on the use of this product to promote healthy gums by a nationally known dentist.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this for seborrheic dermatitis and rosacea and it&#x27;s working well.  I have a prescription face wash and it was only working so-so. When I added the sea buckthorn oil it made a big difference.  I seem to need to use both of them for optimal results but I wish I could do away with the prescription since it has a lot of chemical ingredients I&#x27;d rather not put on my face.  But the flaky skin I get when the dermatitis flares up is awful, so I&#x27;m sticking with the combination for now.</li>
    <li> Healing, but a bit too rich</li>
    <li> I just finished my first bottle of this oil and wanted to add my thoughts. First, I don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin. I don&#x27;t have skin problems like rosacea, just wanted to use something that is good for my 51 yo face. I don&#x27;t expect any miracles right off the bat (or at all really), so I&#x27;m not disappointed. In fact, I&#x27;m very suspicious of most GLOWING reviews in general. So, I can&#x27;t attest to any miracles, but I am buying more because I think it&#x27;s a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, many have commented on the smell--it IS different but not necessarily a bad smell. I think a lot of skin care products would smell strange if fragrance wasn&#x27;t added so maybe this is just exactly what it should smell like. I prefer not having unnecessary ingredients if possible. It doesn&#x27;t bother me since I&#x27;m used to it but it was unusual at first.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to go by reviews for skin care - everyone has different issues, different skin types, different ages, etc. I&#x27;m 50+ starting to show signs of aging and looking for natural products that work. I use oils and think overall I&#x27;ll stick with argan oil. I&#x27;m sure this works for many people - for me it just laid on my skin, did not sink it and did nothing by made me feel greasy and resulted in little bumps all over my face. Just not the product for me.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for what I bought it for, but perhaps it&#x27;ll work for someone else.  It&#x27;s possible I just didn&#x27;t use it long enough, I stopped after about a week when it felt like my skin was breaking out.  I might just be allergic to it.</li>
    <li> Overtime this product has been helping with acne and scars along with some other regimens and a better diet.  Some Oils seem to cause breakouts but this one does not.  It also seems to help smooth wrinkle lines around the eye area as well.</li>
    <li> This is the best oil for your seed ever, keeps you looking young and glowing</li>
    <li> Miracle in a bottle however, the bottle is too small. I can take it where ever but it does make my skin oily.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I had heard about it from a few different people and ordered it. It shipped fairly quickly, and the product works really well. Everyone says it smells terrible, but I actually don&#x27;t mind the smell. It feels great on the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy or anything. The only downfall is it&#x27;s a very small amount. I bought it a few weeks ago and I&#x27;m already almost through my little bottle. I put it on my active pimples and scarring, and I notice that it has helped with inflammation and has decreased the healing time. I will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worked in high end skin care development for years (as a research scientist) and have tried many, many, MANY different very expensive creams/oils/moisturizers/cleaners but have never seen anything like this. I started with dabbing it on some angry red scarring on my hand, and within days saw a drastic reduction in redness. So I started mixing it in with my facial oil. Oh my. Fine lines disappearing, pore reducing, white/black heads gone, skin glowing and even. WOW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using Fresh&#x27;s Seaberry Face oil, and was quite happy with it. To everyone who thinks this product is expensive, fresh&#x27;s product is $50 for 1.7 oz&#x27;s and it contains only a small percentage of actual sea buckthorn oil. This is bloody cheap! I mix a drop or 2 with Badger&#x27;s [[ASIN:B0063NKM6K Damascus Rose Face Oil - 1 oz - Oil]] (though lately I&#x27;ve been just applying 4 drops straight to my face.... and wow!)Personally I like the herby fragrance of the sea buckthorn oil, but if it really bothers you I highly recommend mixing it with the very pleasantly scented rose face oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of spending between $50-150 on products that &#x27;kind of&#x27; worked, this product is a revelation. Not only is it cheap and natural, it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes: I have combination, acne prone skin. Normally on the oily side. I recently switched to the oil cleansing method, using a combination of organic castor/grapeseed and tea tree oil. That alone drastically improved my acne - this seems to have taken things to the next level. I was using Fresh&#x27;s Seaberry Oil, but found that not only did Badger&#x27;s Damascus oil have very similar - and all organic - ingredients, it was a third the price ($11/oz vs $29/oz). I actually ordered the sea buckthorn oil to supplement the Badger oil to make it closer in composition to the Seaberry oil.  For the first time ever, I can say I&#x27;ve found my holy grail. Who would have known it would be cheaper than anything I&#x27;ve used in the last 10 years.</li>
    <li> In 2 weeks I saw a significant change in my skin tone and smoothness.  I am sensitive to most creams on the market and break out from them.  Buckthorn oil has eliminated breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;Does not leave face feeling oily.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Read all the reviews on how great this product was. I have had Rosacea for several years and was hoping to find a product that would help. I tried this, but saw no change whatsoever. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Great product that works very well for my needs. Thank you for offering a great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  It really does soften my skin and reduce redness without causing pimples.  Too bad the smell is unpleasant.  It&#x27;s hard to describe really.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like your run of the mill stinky things like rotting meat, landfill, sour milk, noxious chemicals, skunk, the NJ Turnpike, dead fish, rotten eggs or things that exit your rear.  It&#x27;s just an annoying, unpleasant, and lingering smell.  Ah, the price we pay for beauty ...</li>
    <li> I started using this product to alleviate redness/rosacea and acne.  Within a week of using this product, I saw results!  I have been using this for a month now and still have great, clear skin.  I must say this oil has a funny smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also been taking Dr. Schulze&#x27;s intestinal formula # 1 for digestive issues, which I believe has helped a lot with skin condition.  I highly recommend both products taken together if you want to address your skin conditions and your overall health.</li>
    <li> It is really smooth and healing, and moisturizes well, makes skin look clearer and smooth&lt;br /&gt;Price is right compared to aragon oil</li>
    <li> i dont like this as an allover oil but for eczema patches and dry lips this is the perfect oil</li>
    <li> Great product. Apply it to problem areas - either current or healing acne and it will be gone in a matter of days. It helps to condition and heal skin and I like to keep it for any acne I might get. It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin like tea tree oil, either.</li>
    <li> I have dealt with rosacea for numerous years.  My checks would be irritated and red, and my nose would breakout looking like rudolph with a big red bump.  I&#x27;ve seen several doctors and used many topical products and antibiotics, but seems like once medicine was done, back it would come.  I thought I had nothing to lose by trying this product.  I got it and started using it.  One drop on each cheek and one drop on my nose.  The oil does smell some, but not so bad that I didn&#x27;t continue to use it.  At first I seemed to breakout more, but that also happened with prescription medicines, so I continued using it.  After about two weeks, I noticed that the redness has lessoned and I was not breaking out any further.  In fact, I stopped using the oil as my face has cleared.  I just noticed the bottle on my bathroom counter and realized my face is clear.  I have not had a breakout for the past couple of months.  This oil is great.  It worked for me and I would recommend you give it a try.  I will keep it around just in case an outbreak occurs.  But for now I am pleased to say my face is clear!</li>
    <li> After hearing wonderful reviews from a friend &amp; researching it I decided to try it.I was a little skeptical at first but I started it two a Sunday..drinking a full bottle of water with it.  I have very very very sensitive skin. Before I started taking the supplements  my skin was clearing up. I am a clean eater with a very simple, effective skin care regimen. This is the worst breakout i&#x27;ve had in a while.Now it is Wednesday, &amp; I have cystic acne. I&#x27;ve NEVER EVER had cystic  acne. I am going to stop using this immediately . I know people may say that it hasn&#x27;t had time to build up in my system but I don&#x27;t want to take any chances.  If you have very very sensitive acne, this may not be the product for you.</li>
    <li> This oil is AMAZING. Seriously, it&#x27;s amazing. If you have any red, rough, scaly, dry, peeling, etc patches on your skin, this stuff will do wonders, practically overnight! When I was young, we used to own seabuckthorn trees and we used to make juice out of the berries and drink it, it was delicious and insanely good for you - this stuff is an awesome reminder of those times, now that I&#x27;m grown up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not chemical, it is very similar to how the actual berries smell, I think once you realize that you&#x27;re not breathing in chemicals it will be a lot easier to get used to even if it is a little strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging can be a little difficult to use because it only lets out a couple drops at a time but this is because you really only need a couple of drops, either to work into the whole face (3-4 drops) after washing/steaming it or for spot treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dad has chronically red, flaky patches around the eyebrows and this stuff literally soothed them and made them go away over night. Granted they came back but only because he used this stuff once. I use it to even out my skin tone and heal discoloration from acne spots (which it does well, actually but from my experience Vitamin E oil might do better). It soaks in almost instantly and doesn&#x27;t make you feel greasy or like you&#x27;re clogging your pores (use in moderation!). It also makes the skin smooth and velvety when you wake up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also great for healing burns. If you touched a hot curling iron or pan and left an burning hot painful mark, put this stuff on IMMEDIATELY and you will soothe the burn and prevent any scars or marks from being left. This is an old Ukrainian remedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough about this!</li>
    <li> I have only had this oil for a about a week, but I really like it. I have been using it as a night-time moisturizer. I normally use organic moroccan oil. I am not sure if this is better, but I do it seems to be less &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; which is nice.</li>
    <li> I have much less redness now than I did when I was using it. Now I don&#x27;t get comments like oh, you&#x27;re sunburnt. And it seems to make my overall face younger, less wrinkles. My face still has redness - it is not totally gone so I am still searching for a product or foundation to use to help with this. But I use this every night and love it.</li>
    <li> Wow.  Believe the good reviews, I did, tried this oil and am thrilled with the results.  I have tried and used many many many different oils, creams, lotions, etc.... for my excruciatingly sensitive and vastly combination skin.  Each has done great things, Emu... great results for occasional flaky patches, Tamanu and Argan, my long term favorites that rescued my skin a few years ago and I use almost daily.  This Sea Buckthorn Seed Oil... I am going to call it my emergency rescue oil.  Tried it for past 24 hours, applied less than 3 drops to a seriously annoying dry, flaky, inflamed, itchy, tender patch on my face..... and wow!!!!!!!  While my other oils keep most of my facial skin (and hands) soft and lovely, this oil has literally reversed and repaired this strange little area on my forehead that resembled a cut or burn but was neither.  Was about to make appointment with my dermatologist for ideas, but now I do not need to.  (Have had very challenging skin since childhood and occasionally have these outbreaks)  Thank you Amazon, thank you Sibu, and thank you Sea Buckthorn Seed oil!!!!  And Yes!  I obviously recommend highly</li>
    <li> I use this every morning - I really do like it .... it absorbs well, smells good, no issues at all!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and I break out a bit even at almost 40. This stuff is magic. It makes anything skin related to away quickly and it takes the sting and pain away like nothing I have ever used! Great for any skin breaks or irritation!</li>
    <li> I was taking the pills, but have some problem areas with skin on my face. This product is an excellent temporary treatment for damaged skin -- you can really see healing effects. Can&#x27;t praise this product enough. The only improvement would be a cheaper price. I use it on my face, back of my hands, and -- this is going to sound weird -- on the tops of my ears.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s me or the product but I tried it a couple of times and found it to be too messy to use on the  problem I had on my face. I still have the product though and may give it a try again, however not on my face!</li>
    <li> Got this to relieve eczema...  it doesn&#x27;t really work well.  Disappointed.  Maybe it works for someone else, just not me.</li>
    <li> When I was pregnant with my second child my face skin changed.  I had a constant rash on my cheeks.  The dermatologist thought it was maybe Rosacea and prescribed Metrogel and Elidel.  Both were expensive and neither made a difference.  I had the rash for four years and hated how many people commented on how rosy my cheeks were.  I read the reviews on here about this and figured it was worth a shot.  I&#x27;ve been using it about a month.  I just apply about 4 drops once a day after I wash my face.  And my face really looks just about normal.  I don&#x27;t feel ugly anymore.  Totally worth the $10 to try it. So, so happy.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait until I used this for a while before I reviewed it.  It is very moisturizing which I wasn&#x27;t expecting.  I put it all over my face every night.  Just a few drops is all you need.  Some of my redness is now gone and my wrinkles are less noticeable.  It does have a strong smell but I&#x27;m used to it now.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a natural remedy for my face and I simply love it.  Will reorder when I&#x27;m out.</li>
    <li> Works well on skin rosacea as per recommendation per dermatologist. Mixed into face cream per dermatologist instructions, it does reduce the inflammation.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! It sinks it easily. Smells really good. Just the right amount of moisture; doesn&#x27;t leave me flaky like my badger rose oil or too greasy like argan oil. Yes, the bottle is small but should last a long time since a few drops covers my face &amp; neck.</li>
    <li> I use this oil on my face every now and again. It is soothing and just gives me a radiant glow.</li>
    <li> I started using this and I got the first compliment on my skin in years.  It was obvious that I was doing something that caused my skin to look younger....this was a total shock because my skin has looked rough because of the large pores.  This product seems to be closing my pores and lightening the darkened skin around my eyes due to a burn from using another eye product years earlier.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> This oil is truly an essential oil for skin. I love the smell, and how quickly it works to repair damaged skin.</li>
    <li> just as described, thank you</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s helped improve my skin a lot! I have very combination skin &amp; this really helps make it feel soft! Although the smell is a little overbearing at first, it goes away quickly ! Thank you! I would definitely buy this again when I run out :)</li>
    <li> Broke my face our unfortunately but it may work for you</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this has so many good reviews, because the smell is so intense and so unpleasant, like rancid oil, or compost or rotting wood.  It is vile.  It feels nice and soaks in well and if I could stand to have something this rancid on my face long enough, it might even work, but it makes me want to barf.  So, back to amazon it goes.  I&#x27;ll try something that reeks less.</li>
    <li> we brought this few days ago and use it with moisturizer during night or apply directly to the affected area, and the next day the issue just vanishes , even we have tried to use it at day and it works perfectly fine under a sunscreen.I highly recommend it just one thing that is a bit annoying is the smell but if we look at the benefits it can be easily ignored.</li>
    <li> Several have arrived with broken droppers.</li>
    <li> Item didn&#x27;t seem to help my daughters skin at all.  The smell wasn&#x27;t too good either.  If it had helped her skin, we could have gotten over the smell, but it didn&#x27;t help her Atopic Dermatitis</li>
    <li> bumps went away but my flushed skin stayed the same.  I am testing other products in search for something more effective, even though I did see SOME improvement.</li>
    <li> I might be one of those rare cases, but after one application of this product, my face broke out in severe (well, at least in my mind) acne!  I drink sea buckthorn juice and thought that the seed oil might also have some fulfilling outcome...........but totally not the case.  Facedoctor was great with the delivery..........too bad the product totally did not work for me!  ;-(</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff!  I have fair, sensitive skin.  It hydrates like a dream and my makeup goes on flawlessly!  Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I only use it for night time because it can be a little oily for my skin. By the morning my skin is perfect.</li>
    <li> I am currently half way through my second bottle. I started out using it twice a day, but after watching my skin get worse (acne), I reduced it to once a day.  I cannot say that I ever really noticed ANY improvements. I&#x27;d like to believe that it is good for my skin -- considering it&#x27;s a concentrated vitamin/organic/all natural/doesn&#x27;t contain chemicals; however, I haven&#x27;t seen any obvious improvements in my skin.  What DID help my skin was eliminating process foods, gluten, and dairy. Three days after eliminating these foods, I notice significant improvments -- noticeably less irritation, inflammation, no new breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI - I suddenly (and am still not sure why) developed adult acne two years ago. Diet is the ONLY, I repeat *ONLY* thing that has helped.</li>
    <li> I had heard from various beauty blogs and other places that sea buckthorn oil was supposed to be good for treating acne, etc.  I am usually pretty hesitant about putting oil on my face, but there&#x27;s a big movement right now for using coconut oil and olive oil on the skin, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, especially after reading some good reviews on Amazon as well.  I put this on the first night and by the morning a lot of the redness associated with my acne had gone and the pimples I had were diminished.  Even if it hadn&#x27;t helped reduced the size of my pimples, the fact that it helps alleviate redness makes it much easier to cover blemishes with makeup, even without using a bunch of concealer, just with a good coverage foundation.  I&#x27;ve been using this product every night for a week or so now, and the acne outbreak I had is visible as kind of acne scars (flat pink spots) but doesn&#x27;t really have dimension and is covered by simply using foundation.  This is not a miracle cure, but this worked much faster to help resolve my acne issues that the acne spot treatment I had been using before which was highly rated and recommended to me by a friend and hadn&#x27;t done anything for my acne in a week of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case anyone is unsure of how to use this product, this is what I do: at night after washing, toning, and moisturizing my face, I put five or six drop of oil in the palm of my hand (the oil will look a little orange).  I dip my index finger in the oil and smooth it on my forehead, then keep dipping and applying until I&#x27;ve covered my entire face (I get acne flare ups on various parts of my face, so I just put it all over for good measure.  If you have certain troublespots, you can just put it there).  If I have specific spots I want to be sure it works on (big pimples) I&#x27;ll put a little extra just on those spots.  Others have found it quick to absorb; I think it absorbs quickly enough that I&#x27;m not afraid of it rubbing off when I go to bed, but it leaves my face kind of looking and feeling shinier than usual, so I wouldn&#x27;t put in on in the morning, and I would think the oil would prevent foundation from applying smoothly.  It does look a little orange on my face when I first put it on, but that quickly goes away.d of looking and feeling shinier than usual, so I wouldn&#x27;t put in on in the morning, and I would think the oil would prevent foundation from applying smoothly.  It does look a little orange on my face when I first put it on, but that quickly goes away.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product to make my own face oil. Love the product and from someone with extremely oily skin and prone to cystic acne..I love this product and after a week of use my skin feels better, looks better,and have had no acne breakouts.</li>
    <li> It is an overpriced (per volume) and a low-quality product in comparison with many other available sea buckthorn oil brands. The oil color immediately indicates that it has been significantly dissolved on other oil. Moreover, this oil reacts with the plastic lid, as others reported,- it tells a lot about the quality of this product too.</li>
    <li> The plastic around the lid of the oil had disintegrated and some blended with the product. I had to throw most of it out.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to try it since I had never heard of it.  I have been using it for a few weeks on my face, but I have been unable to observe any changes.&lt;br /&gt;I like it, but it seems to make no difference on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Soon, I will have my daughter try it for acne, and we will see if it does anything.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s weird and counterintuitive for me to treat breakouts with oil, but this stuff is the bomb. I&#x27;ve tried less expensive sea buckthorn oil, like Weleda&#x27;s (nice for body, smells great, but clearly not the same therapeutic grade as the Sibu). The smell is sort of like hay? Odd, but not unpleasant. And since they switched to a dropper, this is MUCH easier to use.</li>
    <li> Seabuckthorn is a not too well known oil that among other things, really works great to calm down Rosacea.  I really love it.</li>
    <li> It is working on keeping the scar from drying out and itching.  Would recommend to a friend and the doctor.</li>
    <li> Starting using product 2 months ago and no breakout with my rosacea since. I use it in the morning and under my makeup and at night after washing with the Sibu Cleanse &amp; Detox Sea Buckthorn Facial soap and then apply the Sea Buckthorn Repair &amp; Protect Facial Cream. Love the products.</li>
