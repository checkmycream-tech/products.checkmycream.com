    <li> It&#x27;s very good for ur acne and it works fast also it came on time.</li>
    <li> My kids who are 14 and 12 love this stuff. They are at that age when acne starts. So far so good with this. I can tell when they haven&#x27;t been using it for a day or two. It&#x27;s really great toner. Try it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I use it every day.  Some days I put have the toner and half water on my cotton pad to tone down the product.  It dries up my acne within a few days.  It doesn&#x27;t have a smell to it.  It makes my skin really smooth too.  That might be the salicylic acid in the product exfoliating my skin.  I would recommend this product to anyone that has acne prone skin to use every day.</li>

    <li> Got the product from some church in dallas and the item looked like it had been tampered with.. l would recommend buying strictly from  mary kay agents..</li>
    <li> I am on to my second bottle. It does the job relatively well, but do not completely get rid of all the acnes including the potential ones.</li>
    <li> Whole system works great!</li>
    <li> Quick and great price</li>
