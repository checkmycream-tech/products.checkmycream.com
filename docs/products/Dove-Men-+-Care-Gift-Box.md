<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a good value, I have purchased several times and will continue to do so. It smells good and keeps me clean.</li>
    <li> Great kits I enjoy the three items in this box. The body wash is great and keeps my skin soft.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if the recipients enjoyed these products.  They were given as gifts and they seem to have been appreciated at the time.  I never asked them if they like it or not.  I know that isn&#x27;t very helpful but that&#x27;s the best I can do.</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas gift for my dad and he loves it and asked me to buy another one :)&lt;br /&gt;It smells great too!</li>
    <li> This is a good quality product and worth ordering online. I bought this for my adult son as a gift. Dove products for men seem to be superior quality to other men&#x27;s hygiene products in the same price category.</li>
    <li> smells very awesome a with a good scent that shines through all day. leaves skin feeling so clean. definity worth the money. infactits one of my primary soaps and deoderant kits. makes people want to get close to you and breath youin. and it softens skin while it cleans of all your dirt. i find that for best results and heavy lather its good to use scrubby shower gloves and/or loofas as opposed to just a wash cloth.like i stated before you can&#x27;t beat the price of this kit.all around a great purchase ,one that i will make several more times and/or it should make a good gift. good luck ,hope your experience is as good as mine.</li>
    <li> I use the same brand of deodorant but a different scent.  This one ended up being very different than the one I have been using for a long time.  The body wash is good but the deodorant seem to wear off after a couple of hours and then it becomes sticky.  If you want to buy this, get the green label one.</li>
    <li> The package came quickly. I&#x27;m sure the products will be fine. I orderd it as a Xmas gift so I didn&#x27;t have to run back to Wal-Mart probably a dallor or two cheaper there. The problem I had is that the package looks old dented and looks like it been opend I don&#x27;t like the look of it maybe it&#x27;s been sitting around since last Xmas but it still will do for a present. But I&#x27;m sure the person will think I had it for a while in my closet cause of the packaging</li>
    <li> I wanted to try the body wash because my boyfriend kept going on about how good it is, but I didn&#x27;t want the 2-pack version because I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d like it. This gift box is really reasonably priced so I gave it a shot. The body wash is great -- good smell, foams well, moisturizes better than any other I&#x27;ve tried (though some of the body washes from Bath &amp; Body Works come close). The little loofah thing is good, though the scrubber side is a little weak (it&#x27;d take a lot of elbow grease to exfoliate properly with it). But it seems durable. The antiperspirant is practically prescription-strength. It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin like other users reported, but it did leave my underarm feeling oddly rough. It was extremely effective.</li>
    <li> I have used the Dove Body Wash brand since it came out. I have tried many other Body Washes and none compare to the Dove Brand. I also really like the Loofa. Brands like Axe have one that I prefer the color more, but the scrubbing part is waaaay to hard for the face. This is much softer and won&#x27;t damage the skin. You will also love the deodorant. It is very sensitive to the armpit. I have used a lot of deodorants that will eventually give me a rash from over use. NOT FROM DOVE! All their products work so well for people like myself with sensitive skin. I will continue to ALWAYS use dove. Plus, I can&#x27;t support OLD SPICE with those horrible TV Commercials. lol</li>
    <li> Was a great stocking stuffer for my teenage stepson. Really great amount of product for price. Very fresh scent. He loved it.</li>
    <li> Great set to to own from Dove for men - will be buying more stuff from the Dove for men collection</li>
    <li> Scrubber sucks. Overdid it with the rubbber</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, and my husband loves this product! The smell is awesome. The guys seem to love the way it feels, I converted my husband and brother from using old spice to this stuff! Will order again soon!</li>
    <li> No surprises here.  Helps you clean up and smell good.  Scrubby thing does the job.  Nothing bad to say here.</li>
    <li> At my local store the antiperspirant and body wash alone cost the same as this box set. However, this comes with both a loofah and the body was is 18oz vs the 13.5oz bottle carried available at my local store, making this box an excellent value.</li>
    <li> I needed a scrubber and the other products made it a GREAT Deal. I wish the deodorant was clear and not white powderish which gets on my clothes but for a bundle deal I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Son liked this product</li>
    <li> This item is perfect and it is well priced. My husband loves the smell of the product and that it comes with its own manly loufa.</li>
