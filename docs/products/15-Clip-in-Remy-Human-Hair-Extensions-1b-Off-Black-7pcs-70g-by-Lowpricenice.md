<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The extensions that i recevied don&#x27;t seem to be 100% percent remy hair its kind of seems like a mixture of synthetic and real, but overall this is a great product for the price. They are very thin so i would suggest actually buying two. They are better than my extensions that i have from Sally&#x27;s beauty supply.. Also my order came with 12 Clip in pieces not 7 which is great, they are the color described and a little longer that 15&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s great to cut to your desired length.</li>
    <li> Cheap frizzy, and dead ends everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d return it if I had remembered and kept the packaging.</li>
    <li> like the quality of the hair, it was just thin, not enough hair.</li>
    <li> Just got my extensions in the mail and I am pleasantly surprised! The first thing I did was run a flat iron through them at the highest temperature to make sure they wouldn&#x27;t melt and much to my surprise I discovered that these are legit remy extensions! My only complaint would be all the shedding straight out of the package but after running my fingers through the hair a few times, the shedding minimized tremendously! I would definitely recommend buyers get more than 1 pack since there&#x27;s not much hair on each weft. I purchased 2 packs.</li>
    <li> love them!!, they look really real!, but one problem was that it was more brown than black. but that might have just been my batch.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t put them in my hair yet. But first thing I did when I got them is put them under 410 temperature and they are for sure 100% human hair...</li>
    <li> There was so little hair on the clips, but it&#x27;s real alright. It&#x27;s just too bad the quantity was less.</li>
    <li> Ok this wasnt even human hair and hey were very VERY thin. i got bored and made dreds out of theem. thats how cheap these are.</li>
    <li> Hair was super thin , did not like the texture because it did not blend in well and wasn&#x27;t full enough</li>
    <li> The hair itself feels  &amp; looks very nice but, when I clip them in, they are very thing &amp; spars. I would have to use 2 -3 sets of these to even come close to looking right. I will keep them &amp; use them for when I wear my hair up.</li>
    <li> I kept reading that these were thin but when i got them i was super excited cause i didnt think so and i didnt think they were going to be real human hair..there amazing and curl really well and match my hair</li>
    <li> Very thin not good quality at all</li>
    <li> Its pretty and its human hair and all but if you have thick hair , buy 2. Its very thin towards the bottom.</li>
    <li> LOVE these. Definitely worth what I paid for. I read the reviews and ordered 2 because I was afraid they would be too thin (I have biracial hair) and two worked great. They weren&#x27;t nearly as thin as I thought they were going to be. They were the perfect length also, they seem to be longer than 15&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s a plus! I will definitely be buying again in the future. :)</li>
    <li> I feel in love with clip in hair extensions when i tried this in my hair. its better than what I expected and now i am going to order more</li>
    <li> The hair is okay...but the 1b is not dark enough so I had to dye it when I got...the dye worked well on the hair.  However the hair is too straight for my texture so I just ordered the SOL Yaki weave..(HAVE NOT RECEIVED IT YET)..so we shall see.</li>
    <li> They were ok, there are thin(70 grams). Some pieces weren&#x27;t put together properly. I have thin/fine hair and my hair wasn&#x27;t thick enough to hide the clips that were closer to the middle and front of my hair. Wouldn&#x27;t go this route again..good luck in your hair journey.</li>
    <li> It was nice for the first day or two but now it&#x27;s just a ratty mess.  Also the color is so inconsistent.  There are pieces of pink and blonde hair.</li>
    <li> This product company say that their new to write a good review.  How is that possible when the product is not good at all. The hair is super thin it&#x27;s only one track on each clip in strip of clipin. My real hair is thin and the 1B I ordered looks like a #4. So disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> Good quality hair with strong clips work great in various styles no frizzing works great with hot hair tools I love it</li>
    <li> This is not remy hair and its not human hair either and they sent me the wrong color don&#x27;t waist your money or time looking at it</li>
    <li> These clip in hair extensions were alright but if you have thick hair please buy some that are for those with thick hair. If you have thin hair then these will be great for you. Also the hair texture feels very soft and that is what I mostly like about it.</li>
    <li> I just received them today. They are very soft and the length is right. I don&#x27;t like that they are extremely thin. They have a lot of strings attached to the weft that needed to be cut off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;U definitely get what u pay for. Btw I ordered these July 12 and they were $14.99 not $22</li>
    <li> I put the hair in as soon as I got it, and not only did a lot of it comb out in my sink, it was extremely thin, and the color looked more dark brown than black. I emailed the seller got no reply. I read all the good reviews on the hair so I ordered it... Waste of money!</li>
    <li> I have to say that I love my clip ins!! For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. I straightened my natural hair and put these in and they blended perfectly! The color, everything. I was scared it wasn&#x27;t really going to be human hair so I put my flat irons on 450 degrees and they took the heat. Flattened them out some, and they look great. You may want to purchase two packs if you want it a little thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - 11/1/2013&lt;br /&gt;I purchased another pack and received horrible hair. I did not know there are different sellers and thought I was using the same seller. The first time I received my clips ins from WIG FASHION INC. they were great, and real remy hair. The second pack I received on 10/31/2013 from seller &#x27;imbroke&#x27; is NOT remy hair. It burned and sizzled like barbie doll hair. Make sure the seller is WIG FASHION, they are the better clip ins.</li>
    <li> its  ok I had better for that price but It will have to do thy should put atleast 15 pcs in the pack cuz its really thin hair</li>
    <li> Got these for my teenage daughter and she loves them.  She likes to try new hair styles all the time and right now she has jet black hair cut in a short shag.  She likes to put these in for a change.  She says the hair is really soft and the length is great.  She says they do tangle easily if she is very active but she still gives them 5 stars for the quality at the price we paid.</li>
    <li> omg i just got these and at first i thought they were thin. but when i put them in GIRLLLL noone couldnt tell me i didnt look good lol they matched my hair soo good and great quality!! buy them you wont regret it!</li>
    <li> No instructions were delivered with the product.  Clip in extensions require at least some basic instructions.  Nothing was provided.  This creates a frustrating experience for customers.</li>
    <li> This is the best idea for long hair. I used to wear wigs and it would eat away at my edges. Clip ons can be worn for long period of time, can be curled and the curl holds well. I have put them in and roller set under dryer and it held extremely well. Very happy with this product.Excellent price. It lasts a good long time.I do recommend to buy two packs for a fuller all over hair style. I</li>
    <li> Lovely texture, blends really well, takes heat well, very light and manageable...BUT like other reviews say, the tracks are soooo thin! I can get away with it because my own hair is thin, so it just looks like my hair grew a few inches without gaining body. But if you want a full look, definitely get 2 or more packs. I will be getting another pack, because I want a fuller look but i can wear it as it is for this week.  Edit: Received the other pack of hair on time. Exactly the same quality as the first and with the two packs in it looks great! Now I know the catch with this hair, it&#x27;s good quality expensive hair, but they sell it cheap because they don&#x27;t give you a lot in one pack at all lol. So by the time you&#x27;ve gotten enough packs to do your full head to your satisfaction, you would have ended up paying for one pack of good quality remy hair anyway. Sneaky, but smart, haha. So I&#x27;m pleased with the hair, but now it&#x27;s left to see if it will stand the test of time without shedding, matting etc.</li>
    <li> they are very thin and scraggley, they dont even look real when i tried to make them blend with my real hair!! very disappointed</li>
    <li> The hair is soft; excellent texture. Its not true to the color in my opinion, its a bit lighter than 1b, but it has a nice natural look, and blended perfectly with my highlights so that&#x27;s a plus for me.  It did shed, but my real hair sheds too, all hair sheds, so no biggie.  They were like 2 strands of gray, nothing I couldn&#x27;t pluck out, and there were strings, but duh, the wefts were sewn before the clips were attached. So threads will be here n there.  So overall no real problems.  Soft, nice, fit me great. Clips are sturdy &amp; it came with extras. I have shoulder length brown hair, so they were a pretty nice addition. If you&#x27;re looking for a lil length, this is perfect for you. Just buy 2-3 packs for a full head.</li>
    <li> So much better than I expected. The hair is thin, but 1.5 packs work perfectly with my relaxed hair. The color is a bit dark. If your hair is not died black, I would suggest getting a 2. Love these and will definitely be buying these again.</li>
    <li> yes its soft but very thin, it like maybe ! track Slit in have with a razor.&lt;br /&gt; would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought these extentions and i thought they were going to be good quality stuff, but they were BEYOND THIN even when i detached them and combined them together they were still thin, worst extentions ever.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be thicker but it will do...</li>
    <li> The shipment was quicker than expected I was surprised and very pleased. When I received the hair it was soft and just perfect on the down side the hair is thin. Which is understandable simply because the product sand 70g of hair your not getting that much hair. If you wanted more hair you would need around 100g depending on the look you want and how your hair is. However the hair was soft is straighten and curls very beautiful make sure you maintain it one a week like the back of the product states also there was a few gray hairs and fuzz ball which was ok when wash there seemed to have been black dye applied to cover up the grays which weren&#x27;t noticeable. All in all the hair is great but thin it shipped great. I&#x27;m going to heck if they sell human straight hair that has more g like 100g hopefully. I also loved the note that came with the product it was very sweet and you can tell they enjoy what they do.</li>
    <li> I never post reviews but I felt this time I had to don&#x27;t waste your money this hair is extremely thin</li>
    <li> it blends well with my hair, and it very easy to curl and straighten!!!! (: I love it, this hair is good for its price.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ll be honest I didn&#x27;t realize that I ordered the wrong color, but I took the risk and dyed them and they turned out just fine! I ordered these on August 22nd, and got them the 29th ! they look like real hair and if you wash them the leave them in a braid over night they look so cute. over all if you&#x27;re looking for thickness or length I&#x27;d get these,</li>
    <li> This is definitely not what I expected. I&#x27;m livid..... The color wasn&#x27;t right... Nothing about this purchase was good... Never again will I purchase anything from this seller.</li>
    <li> Do not buy!!!! Hair will not curl. Not pleased with product at all.</li>
    <li> Its super thin and does not blend well into my already thin hair. I would return but I already threw the packaging out :( Will probably buy the more expensive ones from sally&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> The were dry and thin and not well sewn to the clips wore once will never wear again</li>
    <li> The hair quality was good but very thin.  I had to make additional wefts on my own.  Overall it is ok for the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair about a year ago. I bought 2 packs of the clip ins and the first day I wore them I couldn&#x27;t even go a whole half a day without having to brush them, they get nappy and stiff very easily. Also the hair sheds a lot, like every time I ran my fingers through the hair 2 or more strands would come out, just imagine brushing. But it definitely is human because I&#x27;ve been straightening and curling it.</li>
    <li> This product came very quickly, and I didn&#x27;t think it would, so I was excited about that.  I like the feel of the hair and the look. I would have liked for the density to be a little more but the price was unbeatable so I&#x27;m thankful. Overall I like this product and would buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what I was going to get for the price, but let me tell you these hair extensions are AMAZING. It took me about 7 mins to put them in my hair and my husband was flabbergasted. I just bought another set so I could make the back a little thicker. Very,very easy to use and very soft.</li>
    <li> I bought these bc i have thinning hair and i also wanted tot add some length. Looks great and feels great.</li>
    <li> Thought there would be more hair, its too thin. But it works! Will definitely be ordering more soon!</li>
    <li> I have pretty short hair and I think these are good they cover my whole head and I like the way they look on me thank you c:</li>
    <li> I was not happy with these at all. The hair is so thin and sheds so much. I tried them on only once and they made my head itchy so i never tried them again. I don&#x27;t think the hair is real.</li>
    <li> I must say I was a little afraid because of most of the reviews I read it was a 50/50 chance that I might like it or not but I must say I do love them the hair is on the thin side for me but I will make it work the hair itself is amazing its very soft and shinny you can tell its some good hair but my best advice will be buy more hair but over all love it.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THEM BUT THEIR NOT GOOD TO STRAIGHTN THEM THEY BURN PRETTY FAST SMH BUT IS A FAIR PRICE</li>
    <li> This product is just a filler if you already have extensions. Very thin and if not mixed with other extensions this won&#x27;t look good alone</li>
    <li> This was my first time purchasing/using clip in hair extensions and I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for $20 but was pleasantly surprised! They were very soft, easy to use, stayed in place and looked great! They are thin as other reviewers pointed out but my hair is fine and they definitely made a noticeable difference! I usually curl my hair just so it looks fuller, even if I am going to wear it up, I am thrilled that I can now wear my hair straight with confidence. Also, I made sure I purchased from Wigg Fashion as another reviewer advised.</li>
    <li> i bought from Moonlight14, defenitely buy again .the hair is human hair ,soft and silky, no tangling or shedding .</li>
    <li> This product is great. I got it in good time. I actually got this two months ago and forgot to review :p it came a day before its estimated delivery date. I wear my extensions very often. You can&#x27;t beat this price. Near the clip, some hairs are an inch long but you can&#x27;t see it anyways. The clips themselves are coming loose, but that&#x27;s nothing a sewing kit can&#x27;t fix. I would definitely recommend this to someone. When I opened the package I had to comb and straighten the pieces which wasn&#x27;t an issue. I just store them in a shoebox so they dont get tangled or wavy. They curl great with magnetic rollers overnight and hairspray. I haven&#x27;t tried yet with a curling iron. I will definitely be buying from this seller again when I need new extensions.</li>
    <li> I had ordered these extensions a month ago, yesterday I had just gotten them. Im getting married so I wanted longer and thicker hair, well.  For starters they were synthetic which is obvious. But I havent even wore them but twice and the clips are already falling off of the root of the extension, and I had my stylist put them in so im aware on how they work. I understand they were pretty cheap but this is ridiculous. Definitely not worth the time and or money.</li>
    <li> These are sold as Human Hair extensions but when you go to work with them they fall about.  I was however impressed with their return policy and the quick refund.</li>
    <li> This hair was perfect.. I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I was able to match it with my hair and it looks perfect..</li>
    <li> The Pros&lt;br /&gt;I like the hair. It is 100% human and the curl patterns are awesome. It goes right back to straight. And hasn&#x27;t shed or tangled yet. The length is nice. It&#x27;s 15 inches and I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3, so it&#x27;s slightly past my shoulders. I will post a picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Price is unbeatable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clips are Strong and hold in. (Trust me I tried to tug them out.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was finished my hair in 15 minutes. I mean wow. And if anybody is wondering, I braid my hair, leave out the front and then clip these on. I use it as a protective style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons&lt;br /&gt;The hair will be lighter than expected. I ordered a natural black (1b) and received and medium brown (2). It wasn&#x27;t too much of a problem if you know how to blend. However, you NEED MORE THAN ONE PACK OF THIS HAIR. I don&#x27;t care how small your head is. You need more than one. I brought two because I saw that coming and it was BARELY enough. Buy more than one please!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS: Try the braid method. And yes you can sleep with them in. I did it and everything&#x27;s good as long as you don&#x27;t mind bumping your hair every morning. Some people do take it out and put it back in every morning, but I don&#x27;t have that kind of time. IMO it&#x27;s faster bumping it. But do what you want! If you buy more than two packs I&#x27;m pretty sure you can create different styles.</li>
    <li> Love quality! Feels so real wish it was thicker! Color looks so natural as I was brushing it the were falling. :(</li>
    <li> The hair took forever to get to me 3 weeks to be real and it was a waste of money it didn&#x27;t rod up or anything Don&#x27;t buy this unless u want to waste money</li>
    <li> Very thin welts. Not thick enough to add coverage.</li>
    <li> Not really human hair, not good for dying if you want to, once you comb it it looks like old doll&#x27;s hair. Very annoyed with this product.</li>
    <li> I regret this purchase.. it was very sloppily put together for my order. The weft at the top of the clip is terribly lumpy so there is no way to hide it in your own hair. The stitching is awful. The worst part?, The hair itself was unevenly cut! I can not believe anyone would ship out anything so poorly made, I would be embarrassed if something like this came from my company!</li>
    <li> i bought these and they only lasted me about 3 months. i took care of them as well as i could. they&#x27;re short, thin, don&#x27;t curl, fall apart and tangle up. was not happy with them</li>
    <li> They just came in today. There so soft and the perfect color. They blend well. Good for the price I&#x27;m so happy.</li>
    <li> This hair smelled like rubber (The smell is still on my hands) it tangled up so easily once it came out of the bags it was hard to comb, it didn&#x27;t blend w. My hair, it was too shiny as if it was synthetic hair bought two packs because I read all the reviews but this hair is complete crap,  DONT BUY THIS ITS FAKE HAIR!</li>
    <li> The tracks come loose and the hair loses its shine fast. The ends also split from curling and straightening and there&#x27;s a lot of fall out when brushed. They&#x27;re ok if you just want some cheap extensions while saving up for better ones.</li>
    <li> This product is not for anyone with short, thick, or course hair texture. I was expecting these to be thin so I ordered two packs. The clips are very sturdy but the hair is awful. Immediately after taking it out of the package, the hair began to tangle to the point that I couldnt get my fingers through it. After attempting to brush it, it shed so much that I just gave up. It does not respond to heat whatsoever. The hair is very silky, much like doll hair. This hair is probably best for sosmeone with long straight hair, like that of asian women. It won&#x27;t blend with hair that is of any other texture.</li>
    <li> I really like it wasn&#x27;t like any of the bad reviews.  It was thin but I added two tracks and it looks great .</li>
    <li> First tym extensions for me great their was some white hair n thriers not tht much hair wen you buy it but it feels so real you can style it anyway you want!.def buying more</li>
    <li> This was my first time using hair extensions of any type. I loved them! They were a perfect match for my hair which is looks black but is actually dark brown. They are very good quality. They still look great after a few washes and having plenty of hairspray in them. Also, they came earlier than the expected arrival date and the packaging was excellent. They even came with extra clips just in case one breaks.</li>
    <li> These clip-extensions are on the thin side (which is okay with me because I have thin hair) and the clips are very sturdy. When I first recieved them, I dyed them, washed them, trimmed them, and flat ironed them. After all the styling torture, the clip-ins still looked brand new. I love them! Seven pieces was more than enough for me and the packaging was very neat and clean. I thought that I would be getting crummy quality because because they were extremely affordable, but that is not the case with these! I reccommend these hair extensions to thin-haired laides who long for a little extra legnth and a slight thicker apperance to there locks.</li>
    <li> Hair was not in great condition</li>
    <li> I thought the hair came with clips attached. Its good quality hair but there were no clips in my package.</li>
    <li> These extensions are thin. Do not buy them. I think I found lice too. If I&#x27;m not mistaking.</li>
    <li> these hair extensions  are so soft and smell good. to me they are thick. I cant wear all 7 peace. the packaging was good. and I got 2 extra clips in the package.</li>
    <li> I was not pleased with the product. the hair was soft but quality was poor. I took the clips off and purchased my own hair for my results to be what I wanted which I was very happy with, I will continue to shop just not for that.</li>
    <li> these are very thin, u should probably buy one to two more sets to make it look more thick and create more volume. they feel real which I believe thy are. in the store these are like $150</li>
    <li> I like this hair, I&#x27;ve worn it a few times but its really thin and the length is not really 15&amp;#34;. Yes, if you measure it to the very ends it technically is 15&amp;#34; however the hair becomes very thin toward the ends so its really more like 13&amp;#34; but overall its nice. I would probably get the longer ones next time.</li>
    <li> I receive the hair very fast but to my surprise it was thin and shedding really bad plus it had this weird chemical smell that made me sneeze a lot. I only ordered one to see how they were and I would base this on would I be ordering again I guess not. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s remy either but if you want something fast and just for the moment go ahead.</li>
    <li> I can not believe katy perry put this horrible extensions near her head i dyed this hair took abt 4 times for it to even show a bit of color and this hair is very nappy hard to manage fall out alot and looks like you havent combed it out in 3 years i had this hair for abt 1 month or 2 didnt really wear it much and it does not take heat well i really want a refund or an exchange</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter and when I got it , I must admit I was disappointed the hair is thin and is already falling out . Had I know this I&#x27;d ordered two sets . The delivery was a day late on the time . So if you have thin hair this is good but thick hair sorry this wont work</li>
    <li> DONT BUY!!! The weft barely has any hair on its pointless. I ordered 2 for fullness but I ended up with a head full of clips rather than a head full of hair. Total waste of money</li>
    <li> They are exactly what i wanted!! Amazing quality. They are exactly the color i wanted and everything. I would most defiantly recommend these</li>
    <li> Buen Producto y buena atencion por parte del vendedor</li>
    <li> This company advertised real human hair, that is not the product I got. I feel you should get what you paid for. Don&#x27;t buy this hair!!</li>
    <li> I loved them !!! Although you might want to order two bc they are really thin !! But other than that they are wonderful !! I ordered from angels salon .. And they came within 11 days !! I loved them !!</li>
    <li> First time using clip ins. They&#x27;re okay, I use them to give my hair a fuller look. Not able to curl them. Did not shed, which i was very surprised,  they lasted longer than the secret extensions I ordered online.  Overall, i would buy these again.</li>
    <li> THESE DONT FEEL LIKE HUMAN HAIR AT ALL OKAY THEY FELL LIKE SYNTHETIC!! But they are cheap so..? I dont care! I just wear my old extentions with these and its chill!</li>
    <li> Greaaaat quality hair!! Silky and soft! Nice!</li>
    <li> it was more that i expected it  to  be, it last long</li>
    <li> Send me fake SYNTHIC hair 👿👿 do not ORDER !!! WAIST OF MONEYYY !!!!!!</li>
    <li> I like it. It&#x27;s not that amazing but for the price, it&#x27;s okay. It really add more volume to my hair and if you put it in right, it blends well and looks natural.</li>
    <li> the product i know nothing about except my daughter looks incredibly stupid with it-she is a natural blonde that dyed her haor black-yuck-not black hair, just what she did</li>
    <li> Worst Hair Extensions i have ever bought. And they were absolutely NOT human hair!!!</li>
    <li> Thin and got knotted SO easily. My hair isn&#x27;t even extremely thick and these looked SO fake. The colour was good and the texture but it was far too thin for so many clips. I suppose you get what you pay for though.</li>
    <li> I already had a pack and just needed another to make it look more fuller. This hair is perfect smells great. Yes it is thin if you only use one pack, so do get more than one. I used two and the color is perfect.</li>
    <li> this is my fault  I should have a lighter shade the 1B is too dark for my shade.  Would have cost half of what I paid for to return the item.</li>
    <li> I got my extension Monday i very happy the hair very soft and silky  I curl my hair today the only thing the hair doesn&#x27;t hold it curls all day  but still has a wavy look</li>
    <li> First time trying clip end weave and I love it.</li>
    <li> I know nothing about extensions, but luckily, my hairdresser does.  She said she liked these and wanted me to  give her the information so she could order some for herself.  To me, that&#x27;s a pretty good recommendation.</li>
    <li> They were dark brown not true black but I didn&#x27;t have time to return them so I had to buy hair dye and dye them. I was very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Very nice. They look so much like natural hair. Do u even have a crown piece extension. Pls let me know</li>
    <li> Hair pieces were nice for the price, but way too thin, &amp; they are not black, they are a brownish color.</li>
    <li> they came a week earlier then expected , really cute and thin hair ! but they dont stay clipped on ... one already fell out . other then that they are what i expected and i love them !!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best price I&#x27;ve found for these. I haven&#x27;t gotten them yet. However, I do have a solution for all those considering and complaining about curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush them. Wash them. Blow dry them. hang them. (I use a string suspended by two pins) And then curl them the night before you want to wear them using sponge rollers. Hope this helps : )</li>
    <li> Ordered 2 sets because reviews stated it was thin. Took clips off and turned the 2 sets into one thick set. Basically took the 14 pieces and turned them into 8. Good for the price but you have to make it work.</li>
    <li> These extensions are a little bit thicker than the 20\\&quot; ones I had bought.&lt;br /&gt;However, they look brown in color instead of black and the hairs are a bit curled, which is fixable with a straightener on a low setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are very soft and the length is nice.</li>
    <li> Great value for decent extensions.</li>
    <li> These clip ins are real human hair . When I got them I straightened one strand to test to make sure it was human hair before doing the wholething. The strand didn&#x27;t melt or break so I guess its human hair. So I straightened the whole clip in set and its perfect it is 100% human hair . The clip ins aka the hair is is perfect and feels so nice I love these clip ins :)  the price for the extensions are awesome its really great quality hair . The hair doesn&#x27;t shed it all stays in place</li>
    <li> I love them great price they curl very well clips are not cheap very sturdy they are a little on the thin side I had to order two packs because of the thickness of my hair I&#x27;m African American and the blend very well and I&#x27;m not relaxed. Love love love them. Will be ordering more!!!!</li>
    <li> This hair was a little thin but it was soft and smelled good. I recieved my order in 7 days which was awesome. It was exactly what I expected it to be although I think it could have been thicker, but I am satisfied with this seller.</li>
    <li> Good product! I am pregnant so I needed something simple but cute for the holidays, these extentions was just the thing.</li>
    <li> Great price for good hair I love it extremely easy to put in your hair looks very natural. Recommend this seller</li>
    <li> These are only worth buying if you plan on buying 2 sets or have obnoxiously thin hair. Also the stitching wasn&#x27;t perfect and I had to correct a few spots.</li>
    <li> When I got these they were like a dark brown, they were soft but they were so thin. I have thin hair myself but they were just so bad. Probably not purchasing any extensions from them anymore.</li>
    <li> They work pretty good but dont stay straight very long but when u wear them curly they are amazing (:</li>
    <li> I just wish they came in a longer width so I don&#x27;t have to use so many!  I love the texture.</li>
    <li> I have never used hair extensions before. I had got them because i was in a wedding and my hair is thinning out. I got alot of good feed back about them. Even the lady who did my hair was impressed with them. I like how they put extra clips in the bag. I am very happy with purchase and the price</li>
    <li> I revived them weeks before they said they would get here. They are exactly the color I wanted. They are very quick and very great :)</li>
    <li> Very happy...it&#x27;s thin but so is my hair.....blended in well</li>
    <li> Listed as 1b, but appears to be more of a 2(brown). Definitely not off black in color.  Otherwise, I am pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I Ordered These For My Daughter That Was Going To Be In A Quince And We Were Both Pleased By The Quality Of These Extensions! They Curled With No Problem And They Blended Very Well! Shipping Was Right On Time! I Will Order From This Buyer Again!</li>
    <li> I wish I could give no stars as I was completely ripped off. I ordered as stated 15&amp;#34; Real Human Hair and instead I got $2 worth of Synthetic junk that&#x27;s absolutely not wearable and as of yet I haven&#x27;t heard back from this &amp;#34;dedicated&amp;#34; salesman whom I believe intentionally ripped me off. DO NOT ORDER THROUGH GRACE ECARG</li>
    <li> Good hair but it was really thin and didn&#x27;t last very long. Holds curls great though! Pretty good hair. A bit short</li>
    <li> Pretty good hair, exactly what I was looking for and a decent price.</li>
    <li> Get tangled to easily :(</li>
    <li> They were okay nothing special eventually a bunch of hair falls off I just used them as an ombre effect under my Brown hair</li>
    <li> This item  is not worth $10. Lots of clips and little hair, not up to half bag of hair. Save your money for better things.  I bought 2 and both 2 not up to half bag of hair. Too thin. I could have return it . But can&#x27;t find the package ithat it came in. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair remy human looks real and I use it alot.</li>
    <li> I just got mine in the mail today.. and was so excited! and I put them in and one set is totally enough for me.. It is sooo soft and I haven&#x27;t tried to straighten it yet.. but I have placed them and really love it. I got it days before the earlier est delevery date also... I&#x27;m so pleased with my order.</li>
    <li> I went with most of the reviews because they were good.I would only buy this hair if it was 99 cents so that i could buy several bags!All 7 pieces is the width of one normnal track.Barbie hair looks better.I would say dont waste your money</li>
    <li> youll need atleast two to three of these. they are very thin. but quality is great.</li>
    <li> bought 2 packs. I have thinned hair and the two packs worked great. Ive had mine for almost 6 months and they are still in tact. I will say, some of my clips broke over time, or came unsewn, but the clips and thread are cheap and easy to replace. the hair is still full, when i wash it, it still feels like it did when i first bought it. I can curl and flat iron it. I havent tried to dye it tho. I will say there are some gray strands in it. And the hair is thin, so definitely buy more than one 1 pack if you are wanting to cover your whole head. It shipped pretty fast. Love these extensions, will definitely buy these again. they look so real and color matches perfectly.</li>
    <li> I love this product! it matches my black hair almost exactly, they are very easy to clip in and use. They feel very real and you almost can&#x27;t tell. Each extension is pretty thin, which doesn&#x27;t really matter in my hair, but other may want thicker extension pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came in secure packaging, hair felt great and very real when I opened them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure you take care of your extensions and use stay in conditioners, and non alcohol hair sprays and styling products so they do not get dry. Sebastian potion lite 9 is a great stay in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend these extensions, just keep in mind you may need two sets if you are looking for a fuller look, unless you have thinner hair like me, and it doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. Fast service. Very satisfied. I would totally buy from them again. They are a bit on the thin side but I only needed them for length anyways.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t leave reviews but for this one, I couldn&#x27;t help myself. I have purchased Milky Way extensions before because of the soft feel. I was very nervous to order these because you never know if the hair will be coarse or not. I&#x27;m glad I decided to take a risk because these were wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;The clips are very sturdy so they are hard to fall out. My hair is very thin so I had to take a small section of my real hair and put a clip in it so they would hold. Don&#x27;t worry, it cant be seen once the entensions are in. (My friend does hair extensions so I knew how to put them in but if you haven&#x27;t before, I would look it up because that is very important)&lt;br /&gt;-Start from the bottom and work your way up putting each track/clip in with layers.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t tangle at all and are very easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;You could technically make them yourself (which I have done) however, the thread I used in the past came unravelled because I had no idea what I was doing ;)&lt;br /&gt;The only downside was the packaging for the box was very small and all of the extensions needed to be straightened when they came out of the box.</li>
    <li> So i order them May 1st an i got them on Monday May 11th. I am very disappointed. The hair started falling out already. To get these to work well with your hair you&#x27;d have to buy more than one. I&#x27;ve already got a refund email. So my advice DON&#x27;T BUY THEM!!!!</li>
    <li> It was good quality of hair but kind of short for my liking. In any case it was good!!!</li>
    <li> I thought they were thin for my hair and I had two packs in it</li>
    <li> This is my first time buying extensions, but these extensions seemed very thin but since I have thick hair it was okay because I needed it just for the length,but thicker would&#x27;ve been nicer... Also true the color is more #2 than #1b. The extensions are soo soft too. Not bad for a first timer but next time I&#x27;m going for the18&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Shipping was super fast! I was worried that the color would be wrong but it was exactly what I needed as I have dark brown almost black hair. I have not put them in yet but they are soft and aren&#x27;t tangled or anything. I suppose they are on the thin side but that doesn&#x27;t matter to me because I&#x27;m adding length. Over all I was looking for a cheap first extension to try out and so far so good.</li>
    <li> this is not good hair, its very thin you get what you pay, this hair is very thin and cheap!</li>
    <li> Good quality hair butbtraks are really then but it okay because we bought 2 packs and it gives the fresh relaxed looked I will order more in the future</li>
    <li> these hair extensions are not bad , however they lasted longer than another pair i bought on here .. they do not seem black though they are more of a very dark brown which barley blends perfectly but its fine . even though the actual hair lasted longer the clips did not seem so go with .. the clips became loose &amp; eventually came off into my hair , thank god i was home .. LOL , need to fix the clips and darken the color other wise theyre great! also the hair itself was easy straighten and barley became knotty .. overall theyre not bad at all because this is the second time i got them .. but not a complete 5!</li>
    <li> Hair was very very thin and was not of the best quality. I ended up throwing it away. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> These are not real hair, the clips don&#x27;t stay in and the hair sheds horribly, I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> I ordered these last year and they&#x27;re still going strong. I&#x27;ve dyed them a few times, curled/cut/straightened.. still pretty. Yes they&#x27;re kinda thin, but my hair is thin as well so it blends beautifully.</li>
    <li> It lost curl the first day and frizzed so bad at the bottoms of it i cant wear it again. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> For the prize and quality, you can&#x27;t go wrong with these extensions. They look so natural that people that don&#x27;t know my hair is short, believe is my own hair. Received a lot of compliments. Worth getting them but make sure you buy two sets. Loved it!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about these extensions. It adds just the right amount of body to my hair love this product.</li>
    <li> Horrible hair !! Very thin and tapered from the ends of the hair. Doesn&#x27;t blend in with the rest of my hair at all. Disappointed and regret wasting my money. Save your money and invest in good quality hair instead of the &amp;#34; 15 clip in remy human hair extensions 1B off black 7 pcs 70g&amp;#34; !!!!!!! Good luck.</li>
    <li> This hair would not and most likely could not match the texture of a African american / African man or women hair it is way too thin. This hair wouldn&#x27;t even make a occasion women or mans hair look longer or thicker because its to thin.</li>
    <li> This hair by far it&#x27;s the best hair I have bought on here. They are thin so you need more than one package. The color it&#x27;s true to the chart and I&#x27;ve dye them curl them daily and they still going strong. Love that they are layered so it matched perfectly with my hair cut. Will be a return customer.</li>
    <li> This hair wasn&#x27;t as advertised.it was not Remy hair at all! I was extremely disappointedbbecause I waited a long time to receive this hair.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t use them as of yet but I like it! :-)</li>
    <li> Love them. They fill out my hair nicely and styles well</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t feel very soft and get tangled almost instantly. Not very impressed and don&#x27;t wear them.</li>
    <li> I received my clip ins today from Happy Pretty and I LOVE them. They were off black like I ordered but I didn&#x27;t realize my hair is BLACK. I dyed them today and straightened them. They worked perfect. The only thing is, a few hairs did singe. But only like three. They were stuck to my straightener. I would definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> Met expectations. Perfectly matched my hair and looks natural.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this product. It shipped super fast!!!  The hair was soft. My only issue was the ckips&#x27; size. I wish the piece was a little bigger since my hair is a little thick.</li>
    <li> Awesome hair&lt;br /&gt;Yes is human hair and you can dye anything color</li>
    <li> I was a little scared at first because the pieces appeared to be thin, but once I placed them in my hair, I was very pleased! will buy again!</li>
    <li> This smelled funky coming out of the bag, but I didn&#x27;t know I was suppose to wash them it&#x27;s my fault.  I never did hair extensions so I can&#x27;t tell you the quality of these.  The stylist never said they were bad quality, so I assume they&#x27;re decent.  They also have the clips sewn in with the piece, so all you need to do is clip them on.</li>
    <li> This is the second review of purchase. I am redoing it. The company of this product has assured me that any complaints will be made up. I am very pleased with their customer service. I will purchase from this business again in the future.</li>
    <li> The color was way too light and the hair itself is very thin.</li>
    <li> The clip ins are not a high quality of weave. The clip ins are a grade of course hair. The delivery time was awesome.</li>
    <li> Swear I love this hair it&#x27;s amazing! A must for every chicas hair accessory collection!</li>
    <li> I woulkd love this more if they put more hair, it has very few which makes you buy a lot, and it&#x27;s better you use normal weavings instead. And they should put remy clip in with curls as well as long ones too and different colours. But it&#x27;s a nice product</li>
    <li> If I could give a No Star review I would.</li>
    <li> I hated the hair extensions</li>

    <li> I suggest getting 2 packs because it is thin</li>
    <li> looked different would not buy on line ever</li>
    <li> Very natural looking. Even my family members thought it was my own hair, it blended so well with my own. The only downside is they are a little too thin, so I had to use 2 packs (at least). I just ordered 2 more.</li>
    <li> So, after reading the few horror stories about this hair I almost didn&#x27;t purchase it. I&#x27;m glad I paid attention to the good comments. I am sooooo very pleased with these clip-ins. They are so much better than I could have imagined. The quality is great and they arrived fast. They are easy to put in and blend well. I don&#x27;t have the best hair texture either but I conditioned and straightened my hair really good first and they blend perfect and they are 1b off black. I think some of the people complaining about the color may have thought 1b was supposed to be black and its not, 1b is off black, imagine brown so dark that it could be mistaken for black. However, it could just be the seller they purchased them from (mine came from HappyPretty). They blend perfect with my off black hair. They are human hair and also they&#x27;re not as thin as people made me think they would be don&#x27;t get me wrong they are thin just not as extreme as some of the reviews might make you think. I bought 2 packs and only needed the long piece from both packs and 3 short pieces to make my hair look fuller and longer (my natural hair is shoulder length) but of course buy 2 if you need a head full of hair for your desired look or more variety to switch up the styles but in my opinion one is good for a natural look. Also, I am sure of the difference between a good set of clip-ins and a bad set I have been wearing extensions off and on for a lot of years. Hope my review helps!!</li>
    <li> Its very, very thin. You would have to order about three of these</li>
