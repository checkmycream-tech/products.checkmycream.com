      <li>wonderful stuff.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard Dr Denese say that if she didn&#x27;t use this twice a day, she would be a mass of wrinkles, and she looks perfect, so I am taking her word for it.</li>
      <li>Great product and great price</li>
      <li>They do a great job of firming up the texture, and minimizing the pores.</li>
      <li>Great product at a great price.</li>
      <li>(the eye pads make my eyes water), they seem to be very effective.</li>
      <li>I have used this product before and had amazing results!</li>
      <li>that clean feeling afterwards though!!!</li>
      <li>My face feels and looks good after I use one.  </li>
      <li>This product is great for the skin, it leaves a tingle as it works it magic to firming your face.</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t remember what sold me on trying a Dr. Denese product, but am I glad I did!  </li>
      <li>I love her products!</li>
      <li>Easy to use and feels great.</li>
      <li>There amazing.</li>
      <li>It smelled nice and the pads were bigger.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great buy, fast shipping!</li>
      <li>I have been told that exfoliating is very important.</li>
      <li>Love it on my face.</li>
      <li>Love.</li>
      <li>I wear a lot of Dr. Denese and love these firming pads.  </li>
      <li>I use to order from QVC and found her products on Amazon and will continue to order from Amazon as the price is soooo much better.  </li>
      <li>Love, Love, Love these firming pads.  </li>
      <li>I use with the hydro shield serum and love Dr. Denese products.  </li>
      <li>I love these pads...</li>
      <li>I apply hydro shield after and my face looks even better.  </li>
      <li>Maybe I need to give it more than a week or two, but I can&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
      <li>I love Dr. Denise, used her products for years, including the firming pads.  </li>
      <li>Gentle yet effective!</li>
      <li>She was incredibly helpful, offered a discount for the inconvenience, and recommended that I ONLY buy these products off of the online Dr. Denese store; which I did and had the same great results as original... and believe it or not it was cheaper!</li>
      <li>When Dr. Denese says each pad delivers exfoliation, radiance, improved skin tone and clarity, and helps reduce the appearance of lines, wrinkles, and pores in one easy step.</li>
      <li>Go easy on these.  </li>
      <li>BUT, this time with I ordered the advanced firming pads 100 count within 10 minutes</li>
      <li>if I don&#x27;t see any improvement in 2 weeks time I will return the Advanced Firming Pads for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;Stephanie</li>
      <li>They are gentle and effective.</li>
      <li>I use these and it is amazing how much your cleanser did not get off your face.....</li>
      <li>The next day, coworkers said \\&quot;you look great today!\\</li>
      <li>it is a good one to use, results are only getting better.</li>
      <li>Originally, this had tightened my skin, evened my skin tone, and shrunk my pores.</li>
      <li>The samples were of products I am interested in trying :)</li>
      <li>this isn&#x27;t even original</li>
      <li>They make my face feel so clean.  </li>
      <li>Love these but can&#x27;t afford to buy them as much as I would like.</li>
      <li>its true.  </li>
      <li>I was happy to receive my order so quickly and when I opened the package there were 2 samples of other products to try .</li>
      <li>Alternate it with Denese&#x27;s retinol serum, and your skin will love it!</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin but have been able to use these AM and PM.</li>
      <li>I love Dr. Denese Advanced Facial Firming Pads.</li>
      <li>My face has never looked so even-toned and fresh before.  </li>
      <li>but so far the products I have used of Dr. Denese, I love.....</li>
      <li>Right after you use the pad, you fell like you just washed your face with Noxcema -</li>
      <li>I have been using these as my first step after cleansing for the last 2 years and my skin looks amazing.</li>
      <li>Very reasonable price for the product you get.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used them on an off for many years and always come back.</li>
      <li>Product works exactly the way Dr Denese talked about on TV.</li>
      <li>this product showed me result first night....</li>
      <li>It appears to be the same product I bought from Dr denese on QVC and was pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>Save your money and buy the real thing, who knows what you&#x27;re putting onto your face with these!</li>
      <li>I think they are good, but I am 45, and they are somewhat harsh on your skin.  </li>
      <li>I just whip out one of the very wet and refreshing pads and rub it all over my clean face for one minute.</li>
      <li>These pads seem to really help prepare the skin for the products that follow in her nighttime routine.  </li>
      <li>The shipping is fast.</li>
      <li>very please and have share it with friends for them to try....</li>
      <li>I have used a 12% glycolic acid souffle cream with my morning creams that works comparably but at a much lower price.</li>
      <li>These pads really do make a difference in the skin&#x27;s texture and tone.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product .</li>
      <li>It has become a new routine for me now.</li>
      <li>In the morning my skin is pretty enough without makeup not to scare anyone.</li>
      <li>The first evening I used these pads I was awestruck at how different my skin immediately felt: firmer, softer, cleaner, and tingly.  </li>
      <li>Not at all the same results I had first experienced.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks Dr. Denese for such a terrific product and thanks AMAZON for making this regime affordable!</li>
      <li>i like to use this daily and it makes my face feel very prepped for the hydroshield.  </li>
      <li>I admit I tend to have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe this product was developed by an  M.D.</li>
      <li>Ladies, I&#x27;m 57yrs old with parchment-like skin and use a quality moisturizer when I can afford it.  </li>
      <li>so they go twice as far.  </li>
      <li>I am in my late fifties and have the skin I had when I was 30-[maybe better).</li>
      <li>After just one use, skin is firm, exfoliated, and radiant; visible pores are smaller; and skin tone appears more even.  </li>
      <li>I have SUPER sensitive skin and Rosacea and although I will agree that they sting a little</li>
      <li>I use a 10X mirror and could see that my deep lines were less pronounced, and my skin tingled and glowed a healthy soft pink for days.  </li>
      <li>However, this particular order made my skin oily and dewy long after application.</li>
      <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;It smells like bad alcohol  and one pad isn&#x27;t enough to use on entire face.&lt;br /&gt;Not happy.</li>
      <li>Slight tingling and slight smell, but if they work, that&#x27;s what&#x27;s important.</li>
      <li>I use them at night and really like the little tingle that lets me know something&#x27;s happening.  </li>
      <li>I had what looked like bright red clusters of skin which burned like a bad sunburn.  </li>

<li> so they last twice as long and the benefit seems to be the same.  </li>
<li> not sure if it is working or not because I really didn&#x27;t have an issue.</li>
<li> Exfoliates your face gently enough to use everyday, not harsh at all.</li>
<li> I use other Dr Denese and Philosophy products in conjunction with this,(Hydroshield, Dream Cream, Retinol Eye Syrum,  Full of Promise), but there is an obvious difference in texture and firmness if I go without these for a couple of weeks-and it only gets worse.</li>
<li> Been using these at night for a long, long time.  </li>
<li> even though I have extremely oily skin, they ten to aggravate my skin a bit.....</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll keep using the Dr Dense pads, because they do work, but when I&#x27;m done, I&#x27;ll go back to the other product.</li>
<li> I have been using this product for several years now &amp; like all her other products, this one truly works.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> USED THIS FOR YEARS. BEST PRODUCT OUT THERE.</li>
    <li> I was happy to receive my order so quickly and when I opened the package there were 2 samples of other products to try . The samples were of products I am interested in trying :)</li>
    <li> Love these but can&#x27;t afford to buy them as much as I would like.</li>
    <li> So I got these last Friday - it&#x27;s now Tuesday and I have to say I am impressed. I have SUPER sensitive skin and Rosacea and although I will agree that they sting a little (the eye pads make my eyes water), they seem to be very effective. I definitely see a reduction in the size of my pores and an improvement in the clarity of my skin. In the morning my skin is pretty enough without makeup not to scare anyone. I&#x27;ll update this review after a month of use and see what it does for firming.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this product was developed by an  M.D. I used one of the pads and my face turned flaming red and stayed that way for 2 hours. I admit I tend to have sensitive skin but I use glycolics on an almost daily basis and this is by far the worst reaction I have ever had. Right after you use the pad, you fell like you just washed your face with Noxcema - it&#x27;s that tingly feeling. And then your face turns a deep red and stays that way for hours. These are going in the garbage.</li>
    <li> This product is great for the skin, it leaves a tingle as it works it magic to firming your face. I will continue using this product.</li>
    <li> These pads really do make a difference in the skin&#x27;s texture and tone.  You swipe one of them over the face once a day after cleansing.  I use them at night and really like the little tingle that lets me know something&#x27;s happening.  After a week or so of use, my skin felt and looked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like all Dr. Denese&#x27;s products, but don&#x27;t use them all.  These pads are something I&#x27;ll always use because they do improve the skin.</li>
    <li> Exfoliates your face gently enough to use everyday, not harsh at all. After a while you get accustomed to the slight burning feeling</li>
    <li> These pads are the best of any I have ever used. I&#x27;ve used them on an off for many years and always come back. Slight tingling and slight smell, but if they work, that&#x27;s what&#x27;s important.</li>
    <li> Have used this product (along with other Dr. Denese products) for years and  couldn&#x27;t do without them. It performs as advertised.</li>
    <li> I use these and it is amazing how much your cleanser did not get off your face.....I am always amazed when I do use them!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love that clean feeling afterwards though!!!</li>
    <li> Been using these at night for a long, long time.  Decided to try &amp; save  $$ so discontinued for a while &amp; boy was I sorry.  These pads seem to really help prepare the skin for the products that follow in her nighttime routine.  Also can&#x27;t beat the price compared to Dr. Denese web site or QVC.</li>
    <li> Go easy on these.  I think they are good, but I am 45, and they are somewhat harsh on your skin.  I use these about twice weekly.</li>
    <li> This is really an excellent product. After I wash my face at night, I use a pad, and the always seem to be at least a little speck of dirt still on them!&lt;br /&gt;I believe it contains 10% acid, but even at that concentration I have seen a bid difference in my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can buy the small container, which I thinks only costs about $15, and check it out for yourself. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I use this just hear and there... not sure if it is working or not because I really didn&#x27;t have an issue. BUT I use about once a week, def. won&#x27;t hurt... I am 49 and I don&#x27;t want saggy skin...</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Denise, used her products for years, including the firming pads.  BUT, this time with I ordered the advanced firming pads 100 count within 10 minutes I had what looked like bright red clusters of skin which burned like a bad sunburn.  I rinsed it off immediately.  Next morning, my massage therapeutist said it looked like a burn because the skin is cracked and shiny besides being red.  I don&#x27;t get the difference.  Still waiting for the seller to answer my complaint so I can return it.  I always used QVC, maybe I will stick with them.</li>
    <li> Use this product in addition to a few others to cure/balance cystic acne.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price</li>
    <li> I love these pads... I use with the hydro shield serum and love Dr. Denese products.  I use to order from QVC and found her products on Amazon and will continue to order from Amazon as the price is soooo much better.  I just ordered the microdermabrasion cream so will try it and let everyone know how it does but so far the products I have used of Dr. Denese, I love.....</li>
    <li> No visible results were noted.  It would not order it again.  It may work for others.  I have had SPA treatments so my expectations may have been had.</li>
    <li> I wear a lot of Dr. Denese and love these firming pads.  I use them after my cleansing at night before my night serum.</li>
    <li> I just whip out one of the very wet and refreshing pads and rub it all over my clean face for one minute. The slight burning sensation tells me the glycolic acid is going to work, firming and toning my skin, lightening freckles, brightening skin tone... wonderful stuff. Alternate it with Denese&#x27;s retinol serum, and your skin will love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product previously and it was different. It smelled nice and the pads were bigger.&lt;br /&gt;So either the producent decided to save $ by skimping on everything / fragrance, material / or this isn&#x27;t even original product.&lt;br /&gt;It smells like bad alcohol  and one pad isn&#x27;t enough to use on entire face.&lt;br /&gt;Not happy.</li>
    <li> It helps to keep your skin toned and firmer. if you have sensitive skin, you may want to use it every other night but it is a must have in your beauty regimen.</li>
    <li> I have been using these as my first step after cleansing for the last 2 years and my skin looks amazing. They do a great job of firming up the texture, and minimizing the pores. I am in my late fifties and have the skin I had when I was 30-[maybe better). I use other Dr Denese and Philosophy products in conjunction with this,(Hydroshield, Dream Cream, Retinol Eye Syrum,  Full of Promise), but there is an obvious difference in texture and firmness if I go without these for a couple of weeks-and it only gets worse. So my plan is not to run out anymore!</li>
    <li> I love her products! They are gentle and effective.</li>
    <li> It appears to be the same product I bought from Dr denese on QVC and was pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and had amazing results! However, I feel that this was just not the same. Originally, this had tightened my skin, evened my skin tone, and shrunk my pores. However, this particular order made my skin oily and dewy long after application. Not at all the same results I had first experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: BEWARE!!&lt;br /&gt;I emailed the Dr. Denese team asking what the change was and what I could use differently to obtain different/better results; Dr. Denese personally returned my email and explained to me that there is currently a lawsuit in action for outside companies selling fake Dr. Denese products on amazon. She was incredibly helpful, offered a discount for the inconvenience, and recommended that I ONLY buy these products off of the online Dr. Denese store; which I did and had the same great results as original... and believe it or not it was cheaper! Bottom line, don&#x27;t trust the seller. These products are fakes and being tampered with. Save your money and buy the real thing, who knows what you&#x27;re putting onto your face with these!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard Dr Denese say that if she didn&#x27;t use this twice a day, she would be a mass of wrinkles, and she looks perfect, so I am taking her word for it. I use this once a day, and the peptide pads at night. They definitely help.</li>
    <li> Awaited product eagerly and couldn&#x27;t wait to try the product.  I actually am disappointed.  The firming pads are difficult to separate and they are so wet...I&#x27;ve only used the product for 4 days, but have seen no improvement...if I don&#x27;t see any improvement in 2 weeks time I will return the Advanced Firming Pads for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;Stephanie</li>
    <li> Gentle yet effective! Very reasonable price for the product you get. I use it twice a day, once int the morning and once before bed.</li>
    <li> Great buy, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I have been told that exfoliating is very important. Dr Denese&#x27;s product has the highest glycolic acid I have found.  My face feels and looks good after I use one.  I actually cut them in half so they go twice as far.  I did try using it on my neck and after a short while it started to get a little scaly so discontinued use there. Love it on my face.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years now &amp; like all her other products, this one truly works.  Definite improvement in skin&#x27;s firming and look.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t go a day or night without dr denese firming pads . What a difference they make on the texture and overall appearance of my skin... I highly recommend this product .</li>
    <li> Plenty of product on the pads.  I can cut them in half.  Product makes a noticeable difference within a few days.  I don&#x27;t need to use it daily as one application every couple of days is sufficient.  Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love these firming pads.  I noticed an immediate difference and so have my friends and family.  Just placed another order.  Will be a lifelong customer!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to be without these pads.  They make my face feel so clean.  After only a few days of use I can tell that the size of my pores have decreased.  This product along with the Hydro-Shield are all the beauty routine I need.</li>
    <li> Product works exactly the way Dr Denese talked about on TV. Easy to use and feels great. I plan on reordering</li>
    <li> this product showed me result first night....it is a good one to use, results are only getting better. very please and have share it with friends for them to try....</li>
    <li> The product is 10% glycolic acid.  I think the product does what it says it does, but the price is excessive for what it is and what it does.  I have used a 12% glycolic acid souffle cream with my morning creams that works comparably but at a much lower price. The other product that I use is \\&quot;Alpha Hydrox AHA Souffle Soothing Anti-Wrinkle 1.6 oz\\&quot;. I&#x27;ll keep using the Dr Dense pads, because they do work, but when I&#x27;m done, I&#x27;ll go back to the other product.</li>
    <li> When Dr. Denese says each pad delivers exfoliation, radiance, improved skin tone and clarity, and helps reduce the appearance of lines, wrinkles, and pores in one easy step. After just one use, skin is firm, exfoliated, and radiant; visible pores are smaller; and skin tone appears more even.  Believe the HYPE!! its true.  I will never be without these pads.  There amazing.</li>
    <li> The pads are soaked with plenty of liquid, you definitely feel the initial sting (according to Dr. Denis that&#x27;s what it supposed to feel like). The shipping is fast. It has become a new routine for me now.</li>
    <li> Ladies, I&#x27;m 57yrs old with parchment-like skin and use a quality moisturizer when I can afford it.  I recently decided to, once &amp; for all, find an in-expensive skin regime that works for me or else give up trying anymore.  I can&#x27;t remember what sold me on trying a Dr. Denese product, but am I glad I did!  The first evening I used these pads I was awestruck at how different my skin immediately felt: firmer, softer, cleaner, and tingly.  The next day, coworkers said \\&quot;you look great today!\\&quot;  I mean really, I&#x27;ve never had that happen before.  I use a 10X mirror and could see that my deep lines were less pronounced, and my skin tingled and glowed a healthy soft pink for days.  Because of this product, I&#x27;ve gone ahead and invested in Dr. Denese&#x27;s Night Care Regime and now am keeping my fingers crossed!  Thanks Dr. Denese for such a terrific product and thanks AMAZON for making this regime affordable!</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Denese Advanced Facial Firming Pads. I have sensitive skin but have been able to use these AM and PM. I also cut them in half so they last twice as long and the benefit seems to be the same.  I have tried a lot of products and this is one of my favorites...they also get the last bit of make-up off as well.</li>
    <li> i like to use this daily and it makes my face feel very prepped for the hydroshield.  i cut the pads in half because each pad is thoroughly soak in formula and i have enough using one half pad for both face and neck.</li>
    <li> Although my pores have not disappeared, I feel that they are smaller in size with regular use.  Definitly a keeper.</li>
    <li> I added this to my night time regimen so I can not say how it performs alone but I can say it has enhanced my regimen and made a difference with it. I use these facial pads in combination with a retinol product at night and while I&#x27;ve always used the retinol product the added bunis with the firming pads is waking up with my skin feeling tighter the longer i use them. What I do not like is even though I have extremely oily skin, they ten to aggravate my skin a bit..... but the warning is on the package about that.</li>
    <li> Love. Dr denese her products are wonderful. No one believes my age. I have been using them for years.</li>
    <li> Have been using these pads for about two months but through a different vendor.  My face has never looked so even-toned and fresh before.  I apply hydro shield after and my face looks even better.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> Maybe I need to give it more than a week or two, but I can&#x27;t see any difference. I feel a tingle on my skin but I don&#x27;t see any actual difference in lift or firming.</li>
