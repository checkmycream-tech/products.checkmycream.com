### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It helps to control my frizzy hair, but not the perfect solution as I had hoped</li>
      <li>This is the best hair spray i&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
      <li>Even on a day when it was 95% humidity, my hair stayed PERFECT all day, even the curls I had done stayed in without falling.</li>
      <li>wonderful is all i can say</li>
      <li>This is the best hair sealant/protector that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>and this is great for adding shine to your hair.</li>
      <li>This seems to be as good..</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>Works great for light frizz.</li>
      <li>The smell is nice, though.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>and I love this product.</li>
      <li>Was told THEYRE no longer making it any more.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product and it was delivered when they said it would.</li>
      <li>This is a much better deal than Ulta, where I paid $6 for a travel size containing a fraction of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In desperation, I searched online for an easy anti frizz product that would save my life.</li>
      <li>Came very quickly</li>
      <li>product does not have a strong smell.  </li>
      <li>My hair looks shiny and smooth without getting oily.</li>
      <li>After one light application, my hair does not feel greasy or oily.  </li>
      <li>Use the smooth and seal for years.</li>
      <li>It has a light, clean fragrance after application that dissipates after 20-30 minutes.  </li>
      <li>Not really crazy about how this makes my hair feel but did make it smooth and frizz-free.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So far, it&#x27;s doing a pretty good job.  </li>
      <li>After my hair is all ready to go in the morning, I spray a good amount of this on top and then pat my flyaways down.  </li>
      <li>This is pretty good (not perfect, but pretty good) at holding all the frizz and flyaways</li>
      <li>(The scent is not bad, but nobody wants lingering hair product scents.)</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel stiff after I flat iron, and it smells great!</li>
      <li>Anywho, I would definitely recommend this product to anybody, and I will most certainly be ordering more of these bottles in the future!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use a large amount, otherwise it will make your hair greasy.</li>
      <li>Works well but really dries out your hair</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference with this.  </li>
      <li>However, if you spray too much it leaves hair looking greasy.</li>
      <li>as a former hairdresser -this product and smooth and seal have always been my favorite-creates shine WO oiliness ))</li>
      <li>I live in the swamp and a light coating prevents frizz, curlies, and that icky halo of wiry hairs that seem to stick straight up no matter what.  </li>
      <li>Makes hair shiny &amp; soft.</li>
      <li>This product completely eliminated ALL of the frizz.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t give my hair much of a shine and it only lasts for a short while.</li>

<li> I prefer to wear my hair straight, but doing so highlights frizz and flyaways, especially at the top of my head (around my part is where it&#x27;s worst).  </li>
<li> However, if I&#x27;m lazy and use this without shampooing between applications, my hair does get a bit heavy after 3-4 days (which is reasonable, considering).  </li>
<li> It works fine for the frizz taming but makes my hair too greasy:(</li>
<li> Spray a little after the shower and no frizz through out the day.</li>
<li> It does not leave your hair sticky or stiff.  </li>
<li> Ever since I dyed my hair, I have had insanely bad experiences with frizz--especially in my bangs.</li>
<li> But smells horrible to me.</li>
<li> Smells awful and feels oily</li>

    <li> Came very quickly and I love this product.</li>
    <li> Ever since I dyed my hair, I have had insanely bad experiences with frizz--especially in my bangs. In desperation, I searched online for an easy anti frizz product that would save my life. This product completely eliminated ALL of the frizz. Even on a day when it was 95% humidity, my hair stayed PERFECT all day, even the curls I had done stayed in without falling. An added plus, this product does NOT make my hair sticky, and the scent doesn&#x27;t linger all day. (The scent is not bad, but nobody wants lingering hair product scents.) Anywho, I would definitely recommend this product to anybody, and I will most certainly be ordering more of these bottles in the future!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair sealant/protector that I&#x27;ve ever used. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel stiff after I flat iron, and it smells great!</li>
    <li> It works fine for the frizz taming but makes my hair too greasy:(</li>
    <li> I live in the swamp and a light coating prevents frizz, curlies, and that icky halo of wiry hairs that seem to stick straight up no matter what.  I can go out in summer after blow drying my hair with this and it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve ever found that works.  It has a light, clean fragrance after application that dissipates after 20-30 minutes.  After one light application, my hair does not feel greasy or oily.  However, if I&#x27;m lazy and use this without shampooing between applications, my hair does get a bit heavy after 3-4 days (which is reasonable, considering).  This is a much better deal than Ulta, where I paid $6 for a travel size containing a fraction of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing - be advised that this goes on LAST.  This is a finishing spray that is not formulated for heating under dryers, straighteners, or curling irons.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as  thought it would. Doesn&#x27;t give my hair much of a shine and it only lasts for a short while.</li>
    <li> It helps to control my frizzy hair, but not the perfect solution as I had hoped</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product and it was delivered when they said it would.</li>
    <li> Works well but really dries out your hair</li>
    <li> Smells awful and feels oily</li>
    <li> This is the best hair spray i&#x27;ve ever had! it leaves your hair instantly shinier and smoother.&lt;br /&gt; Don&#x27;t use a large amount, otherwise it will make your hair greasy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference with this.  The smell is nice, though.</li>
    <li> wonderful is all i can say</li>
    <li> I prefer to wear my hair straight, but doing so highlights frizz and flyaways, especially at the top of my head (around my part is where it&#x27;s worst).  I&#x27;ve decided to try to do something about it, so I bought this spray to see if it could hold the flyaways down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, it&#x27;s doing a pretty good job.  After my hair is all ready to go in the morning, I spray a good amount of this on top and then pat my flyaways down.  This is pretty good (not perfect, but pretty good) at holding all the frizz and flyaways down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not have a strong smell.  It does not leave your hair sticky or stiff.  If I touch my hair where I&#x27;ve sprayed this, it feels about the same as the surrounding hair (in other words, soft).  The effects last all day at work so I don&#x27;t have to worry about looking in the mirror at lunch time.</li>
    <li> Not really crazy about how this makes my hair feel but did make it smooth and frizz-free.</li>
    <li> I love this product! My hair looks shiny and smooth without getting oily.</li>
    <li> I have dry, course, frizzy hair and this is great for adding shine to your hair. However, if you spray too much it leaves hair looking greasy.</li>
    <li> Works great for light frizz. Makes hair shiny &amp; soft. But smells horrible to me.</li>
    <li> pervect transaction &amp; product</li>
    <li> I love it. Spray a little after the shower and no frizz through out the day.</li>
    <li> Use the smooth and seal for years. Was told THEYRE no longer making it any more. This seems to be as good..as a former hairdresser -this product and smooth and seal have always been my favorite-creates shine WO oiliness ))</li>
