### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I was impressed with the finished look -</li>
      <li>They are great!</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ve been on for 4 days and they still look perfect.</li>
      <li>They look great!</li>
      <li>Loved these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was worth the effort because they look great!</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>LOVE!</li>
      <li>I am in love!</li>
      <li>This is truly an amazing product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had a couple people comment how nice my nails looked</li>
      <li>but since these have been on the market, imo, they&#x27;re the best for a polished, professional look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The whole-nail strips really are easy to apply and incredibly long-lasting.</li>
      <li>and they thought I had them done at the salon :)</li>
      <li>but I managed to get the white tips looking even and am now on day 2 and 9/10 nails are still flawless.</li>
      <li>Love these, and all Sally Hansen Salon effects.</li>
      <li>I love being able to do a long-lasting manicure at home, that is better for my nails</li>
      <li>I think the Sally&#x27;s are my favorite.  </li>
      <li>Even using my dominant hand, I can&#x27;t say the results are much more professional-looking than if I had painted them freehand.</li>
      <li>LOVE the way you can get a near-perfect manicure at home for 1/3 of the cost.</li>
      <li>followed the prep instructions, which were easy.</li>
      <li>The strips don&#x27;t pull off the backing easily at all (and if they do, there&#x27;s not instructions as to how to get them</li>
      <li>They can be easily shaved with a file to form to your nail.</li>
      <li>I loved that there was no drying time - I&#x27;ll happily take the little bit of time and patience required to apply these over waiting hours before you can truly do much after applying nail polish.</li>
      <li>I bought these a while ago on special for $10.</li>
      <li>Third, even if you do manage to get them onto your nails intact, good luck positioning them where you want them.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They lasted 10 full days, with NO pampering, with NO</li>
      <li>you are looking to kill the better part of an hour and don&#x27;t care too much about the results</li>
      <li>/&gt;They looked just like a professional gel job, but MUCH cheaper, done at my own convenience and no annoying drying time.</li>
      <li>I have opened so many of them and they are all clear</li>
      <li>I love the professional look</li>
      <li>I actually liked Sally Hansen Salon Effects until I tried the French Mani variety.</li>
      <li>I adored the first mani.</li>
      <li>Thanks for nothing, Sally!</li>
      <li>it worked better to clip the extra length with nail clippers, it trimmed the strip and the nail</li>
      <li>Looks great and last a long time!</li>
      <li>If you are seriously looking for a fast, flawless french mani, go to the salon and pay a professional.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Jsut gotta keep your hand steady!</li>
      <li>have been doing my french manicures for a while now either using the nail guide stickeys or free hand</li>
      <li>They grew out before they really chipped.</li>
      <li>The white tips on the french manicure come out so nice.</li>
      <li>This was my first time using them, they&#x27;re really easy to use but just be careful if you want to repoisition them.</li>
      <li>so not likely to buy very often unless they are on special.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They were a breeze to apply - my first time came out great and took less than a half hour.</li>
      <li>and they usually come out nice</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;d say the end result is not quite salon quality but way better than I could do myself with a traditional French mani kit.</li>
      <li>No point in applying regular nail polish since it does not last more than a day for</li>
      <li>Also, the manicure lasts days and days longer than conventional nail polish, which is great news for my left thumb, as it is the one nail that actually turned out nicely.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I needed help with my left hand, but it is sooo worth</li>
      <li>Second, they do not peel off the backing easily at all, especially if you are trying to peel them off with an already-finished nail.</li>
      <li>The package says apply to bare nails, but I find they stick better and last longer if I apply over a coat of rubberized basecoat, such as Orly.</li>
      <li>Not only is it just easier than fussing with wet nail polish and drying time, but it&#x27;s more durable and lasts longer.</li>
      <li>Like dry enough that you would feel comfortable leaving them like it was all you were putting on.</li>
      <li>The box comes with the white tip stickers and a clear sticker that goes over the whole thing.</li>
      <li>Had a spare 30 minutes 2 days ago and gave them a try - I&#x27;m a complete novice at these types of products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>far, they&#x27;ve lasted two weeks.</li>
      <li>I was looking for something like this for a long time, I needed the white strips to create salon looking french tips on my nails, I just used the white strips on my nails and used clear polish on top of them.</li>
      <li>No mess, no fuss and</li>
      <li>I particularly like to use them as a feature nail with my regular solid colour</li>
      <li>Once all the tips were done I did the same for the clear strips.</li>
      <li>The only this is I don&#x27;t care for the clear stickers.</li>
      <li>If I were reviewing only the clear coat nail strips, this would be a whole other story.</li>
      <li>First, the instructions don&#x27;t tell you that the tips come two to a strip, so you may end up tossing half your supply without ever realizing it.  </li>
      <li>pressed, I could come up with a couple of selling points: there is truly no drying time with these, and that is a nice bonus after already having spent 45 frustrating minutes on the application.</li>
      <li>/&gt;To make these last: Apply Salley Hansen Hard as Nails Top Coat every other day.</li>
      <li>The pink strips are clear, I will use them to protect the my french tips next time</li>

<li> you&#x27;re curious about Sally Hansen&#x27;s Salon Effects, do yourself a favour and stick with one of the basic designs.&lt;br /&gt;Would not purchase again.ne nail that actually turned out nicely.&lt;br</li>

<li> I don&#x27;t know why it took me that long just to do 5 nails, but I don&#x27;t have time for this.</li>

<li> you&#x27;re curious about Sally Hansen&#x27;s Salon Effects, do yourself a favour and stick with one of the basic designs.&lt;br /&gt;Would not purchase again.</li>
<li> I will never understand why there is such an odd number of strips and white tips.</li>
<li> I used the pink sparkle ones.</li>
<li> so I am either missing the strips or am not seeing the white strips.  </li>
<li> It works so much better, but I hate paying that price and using only half of the product.</li>
<li> When they&#x27;re in this process your hair and other things get caught on them.</li>
<li> I have put off buying these for a while, I just think they are a little pricey and usually end up not buying them, but I was in rite-aid the other day an just decided to finally treat myself to them and give them a try.  </li>
<li> ; thing about these strips is that it was hard to peel off the white tips, i ended up ruining about 4 of them.</li>
<li> wasted $10 on this and ultimately just took all of it off and painted my nails freehand as per usual.  </li>
<li> As other reviewers also mention, it took me a few minutes to work out</li>
<li> So about the time you&#x27;ve done a few nails and start realizing that you&#x27;ve tossed half your strips in the trash already, it&#x27;s too late.&lt;br</li>
<li> But please, buy it on sale, because for around the price of an entire bottle of conventional nail polish, you are getting only one application that you will hate yourself for starting by the time you&#x27;re halfway</li>
<li> the sheer strip that goes over the white tip makes your manicure look dulled or dirty,</li>
<li> and IMO this product was a waste of money.</li>
<li> I will not be buying these again, it was a waste of $10.  </li>
<li> The nail polish color strips were too narrow and did not go all the way to the edges of my nails</li>
<li> I never used to paint my nails because they would just chip within a few hours no matter what.</li>
<li> and I have small hands</li>
<li> You might have a different experience than I did, maybe my box was defective or maybe I was doing something wrong and didn&#x27;t see something I was supposed to - but either way- for me</li>
<li> It&#x27;s really hard.</li>
<li> I became so frustrated that I finally just threw them all away.  </li>
<li> I wasted $12.00 on this lousy product.</li>
<li> And that would be disastrous, because I had to toss at least four of them due to positioning mishaps or sticking to themselves before I could ever get them on the nail.</li>
<li> , I guess you could do worse than trying this product.</li>
<li> Yes, I have 10 fingers; sadly, I did not realize the shortage until I had 1 hand already done.</li>
<li> My kit was factory sealed yet failed to contain all the needed strips.</li>
<li> in all, you cannot go wrong with these!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my second purchase of these nail strips. I adored the first mani. I used the pink sparkle ones. They grew out before they really chipped. Tonight I applied the French manicure set. I do not like the results :( the sheer strip that goes over the white tip makes your manicure look dulled or dirty, nothing like what it looks like on the box. (Husband&#x27;s account used for review ).</li>
    <li> This is truly an amazing product. Not only is it just easier than fussing with wet nail polish and drying time, but it&#x27;s more durable and lasts longer. LOVE the way you can get a near-perfect manicure at home for 1/3 of the cost. The white tips on the french manicure come out so nice. Jsut gotta keep your hand steady! LOVE!</li>
    <li> I have put off buying these for a while, I just think they are a little pricey and usually end up not buying them, but I was in rite-aid the other day an just decided to finally treat myself to them and give them a try.  They were almost $10.  The box came with 3 sealed packets of strips.  I don&#x27;t know if I am just not looking at the strips correctly or what but I can not find the white strips.  I have opened so many of them and they are all clear so I am either missing the strips or am not seeing the white strips.  I became so frustrated that I finally just threw them all away.  I will not be buying these again, it was a waste of $10.  It would have been helpful for the packets to be labeled or something to make it obvious what each packet contained.  I even tried looking up tutorials and they weren&#x27;t helpful at all in identifying which packet or strips contained the white tips. You might have a different experience than I did, maybe my box was defective or maybe I was doing something wrong and didn&#x27;t see something I was supposed to - but either way- for me and IMO this product was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Loved these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were a breeze to apply - my first time came out great and took less than a half hour. I think I could do it even faster next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They lasted 10 full days, with NO pampering, with NO extra topcoat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I will definitely use a topcoat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They looked just like a professional gel job, but MUCH cheaper, done at my own convenience and no annoying drying time. Just apply and you are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a fleshy camouflage base coat under mine and that worked great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, you cannot go wrong with these! Next time I find a sale I will stock up on them.</li>
    <li> I have these and the incoco strips. I think the Sally&#x27;s are my favorite.  I love the professional look these french manicure strips give.&lt;br /&gt;I have been doing my french manicures for a while now either using the nail guide stickeys or free hand and they usually come out nice but since these have been on the market, imo, they&#x27;re the best for a polished, professional look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, they&#x27;ve lasted two weeks. Not to mention, my nails have grown underneath as well.</li>
    <li> I never used to paint my nails because they would just chip within a few hours no matter what. My mom uses only these and convinced me to try them. They are great! They actually stick on (which requires some practice and technique) and look like the picture. The box comes with the white tip stickers and a clear sticker that goes over the whole thing. They can be easily shaved with a file to form to your nail. The only this is I don&#x27;t care for the clear stickers. After just a few days they start to unstuck near your cuticle and gradually peel off. When they&#x27;re in this process your hair and other things get caught on them. Instead, I use only the white tips, which are extremely durable (3 weeks) and the cover them in clear nail polish. It works so much better, but I hate paying that price and using only half of the product.</li>
    <li> 1. Nowhere in the instructions does it tell you that each white tip strip contains TWO tips.  So about the time you&#x27;ve done a few nails and start realizing that you&#x27;ve tossed half your strips in the trash already, it&#x27;s too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The strips don&#x27;t pull off the backing easily at all (and if they do, there&#x27;s not instructions as to how to get them to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasted $10 on this and ultimately just took all of it off and painted my nails freehand as per usual.  Complete waste of 15 minutes of my life.</li>
    <li> Just bought these from my local RiteAid and they only come with 8 nail tip strips. Wth? What am I supposed to do with 8 tip strips? I have 10 fingers. Thanks for nothing, Sally!</li>
    <li> I got halfway through doing this French after 30 minutes &amp; just gave up. I don&#x27;t know why it took me that long just to do 5 nails, but I don&#x27;t have time for this. Plus, one of my nails is already messing up.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Looks great and last a long time!</li>
    <li> I was looking for something like this for a long time, I needed the white strips to create salon looking french tips on my nails, I just used the white strips on my nails and used clear polish on top of them. They look great! But the drawback is that there is only a limited number of white strips.  The pink strips are clear, I will use them to protect the my french tips next time I paint them on my self.</li>
    <li> I am in love! I hate acrylics cause it hurts to put them on and they ruin my nails. I started doing gel but it gets pricey and they start chipping within 3 hours. No point in applying regular nail polish since it does not last more than a day for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased some Sally Hansen strips and I LOOVE them. They&#x27;ve been on for 4 days and they still look perfect. And it only cost me $8!! And I am not ruining my nails by applying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, applying them took me about an hour and I needed help with my left hand, but it is sooo worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me it worked better to clip the extra length with nail clippers, it trimmed the strip and the nail perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; thing about these strips is that it was hard to peel off the white tips, i ended up ruining about 4 of them. But since there were extras, I had enough to cover all 10 nails.  It&#x27;s not a big deal considering how well the strips work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a couple people comment how nice my nails looked and they thought I had them done at the salon :)</li>
    <li> Love these, and all Sally Hansen Salon effects. They stay on my nails for 10-14 days! I love being able to do a long-lasting manicure at home, that is better for my nails then salon gel manicures.  The package says apply to bare nails, but I find they stick better and last longer if I apply over a coat of rubberized basecoat, such as Orly.</li>
    <li> Of all nail strips I have used, these took the longest to apply (about 45 min.). But that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m a perfectionist and took my time. It was worth the effort because they look great! I&#x27;ve had these on for 7 days now and still look good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make these last: Apply Salley Hansen Hard as Nails Top Coat every other day. Try to seal in any areas that look like they are about to chip or any &amp;#34;bald areas&amp;#34; with exposed nail.  My nails have lasted through hours of computer work, tons of hand and dishwashing, and house cleaning where Lysol wipes ALWAYS eat away at my polish. These strips might last longer than 10 days!</li>
    <li> This was my first time using them, they&#x27;re really easy to use but just be careful if you want to repoisition them. It&#x27;s really hard. Also, I didn&#x27;t like the color of the bottom strips so I painted them (theres nothing wrong with what it came with) but just make sure your nails are COMPLETELY dry before trying to put these stickers on. Like dry enough that you would feel comfortable leaving them like it was all you were putting on.</li>
    <li> I tried these and they were horrible! I will never understand why there is such an odd number of strips and white tips. My kit was factory sealed yet failed to contain all the needed strips. There were only 8 total white tip strips....Yes, I have 10 fingers; sadly, I did not realize the shortage until I had 1 hand already done. The nail polish color strips were too narrow and did not go all the way to the edges of my nails and I have small hands, I wear a size 7 glove, so I don&#x27;t have giant hands. I wasted $12.00 on this lousy product. I think Sally Hansen has diminished in quality over the  years.</li>
    <li> If you are seriously looking for a fast, flawless french mani, go to the salon and pay a professional.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to kill the better part of an hour and don&#x27;t care too much about the results, I guess you could do worse than trying this product. But please, buy it on sale, because for around the price of an entire bottle of conventional nail polish, you are getting only one application that you will hate yourself for starting by the time you&#x27;re halfway through.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s all in the tips.  If I were reviewing only the clear coat nail strips, this would be a whole other story. I actually liked Sally Hansen Salon Effects until I tried the French Mani variety. The whole-nail strips really are easy to apply and incredibly long-lasting. I particularly like to use them as a feature nail with my regular solid colour choices.&lt;br /&gt;But, the french tips.  First, the instructions don&#x27;t tell you that the tips come two to a strip, so you may end up tossing half your supply without ever realizing it.  And that would be disastrous, because I had to toss at least four of them due to positioning mishaps or sticking to themselves before I could ever get them on the nail. Second, they do not peel off the backing easily at all, especially if you are trying to peel them off with an already-finished nail. Expect some to curl up irretrievably when you try to remove them. Third, even if you do manage to get them onto your nails intact, good luck positioning them where you want them. Even using my dominant hand, I can&#x27;t say the results are much more professional-looking than if I had painted them freehand. I suppose your mileage may vary on that point.&lt;br /&gt;If pressed, I could come up with a couple of selling points: there is truly no drying time with these, and that is a nice bonus after already having spent 45 frustrating minutes on the application. Also, the manicure lasts days and days longer than conventional nail polish, which is great news for my left thumb, as it is the one nail that actually turned out nicely.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re curious about Sally Hansen&#x27;s Salon Effects, do yourself a favour and stick with one of the basic designs.&lt;br /&gt;Would not purchase again.ne nail that actually turned out nicely.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re curious about Sally Hansen&#x27;s Salon Effects, do yourself a favour and stick with one of the basic designs.&lt;br /&gt;Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I bought these a while ago on special for $10. Had a spare 30 minutes 2 days ago and gave them a try - I&#x27;m a complete novice at these types of products.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the prep instructions, which were easy. As other reviewers also mention, it took me a few minutes to work out the 8 white strips had two strips each, making a total of 16 white tips. I had no problem peeling them off or applying. I applied and filed the white strip on one nail before moving to the next nail. Once all the tips were done I did the same for the clear strips. I loved that there was no drying time - I&#x27;ll happily take the little bit of time and patience required to apply these over waiting hours before you can truly do much after applying nail polish. No mess, no fuss and I was impressed with the finished look - perhaps it was beginners luck but I managed to get the white tips looking even and am now on day 2 and 9/10 nails are still flawless. One has chipped off.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d say the end result is not quite salon quality but way better than I could do myself with a traditional French mani kit. They are pricey though (some stores in Aus sell them for AUD36) so not likely to buy very often unless they are on special.</li>
