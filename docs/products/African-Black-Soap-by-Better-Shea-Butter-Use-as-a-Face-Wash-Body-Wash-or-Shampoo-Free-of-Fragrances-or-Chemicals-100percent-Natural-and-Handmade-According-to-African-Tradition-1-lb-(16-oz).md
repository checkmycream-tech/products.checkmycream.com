      <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced this kind of clean with any store bought brand.</li>
      <li>It is by far  the best I have used.</li>
      <li>Before, I had used Dudu Osun, but the ingredients were not the best for people with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
      <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>

      <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I appreciate this cruelty free and animal free product that is saving my body and face!</li>
      <li>The packaging made it very convenient to store it, and it lasted me for a good while, I&#x27;m still not done with it.</li>
      <li>I am 51 and think this is a wonderful product for aging skin as it provides deep cleaning with mild exfoliating properties.</li>
      <li>Until I realized that Ivory is also full of chemicals!</li>
      <li>It has a lovely mild scent to it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is 100% natural and perfect for people with sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I thought that this soap was fantastic.</li>
      <li>This is so good, leaves skin clean, soft and hydrated.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t get much more pure than ash and oil.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more very soon.</li>
      <li>Price is very reasonable and ships quickly!</li>
      <li>My new favorite full body soap.</li>
      <li>Great bar of soap for everyday use.</li>
      <li>It was well worth the money.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does get melty/mushy when wet, and I haven&#x27;t yet found a soap dish I love that drains appropriately.</li>
      <li>I rub the top of the soap with wet shower gloves to work up a nice soft lather.  </li>
      <li>I use it to wash my face and beard and surprisingly I&#x27;ve noticed less blackheads and breakouts.</li>
      <li>(I keep most of it in the fridge, and about a week&#x27;s worth is kept just outside the shower in a soap container).</li>
      <li>but I do occasionally use coconut oil after bathing for super smooth skin.</li>
      <li>It gives a natural clean without chemicals and fragrance.  </li>
      <li>My order will probably last another two months, easy.</li>
      <li>This is a pure, unscented bar soap.</li>
      <li>My skin type is very oily.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is the real deal.</li>
      <li>Immediately opening the packaging I could tell this was the real deal.</li>
      <li>This black soap looks good enough to eat (please don&#x27;t).</li>
      <li>if you&#x27;re looking for a good quality african black soap, this one is.</li>
      <li>My skin feels soft and smooth and fine wrinkles seem less visible since I&#x27;ve starting using this soap.  </li>
      <li>I used Ivory soap my whole life, because it was &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; and other soaps full of perfumes and coloring made me break out.</li>
      <li>If it just fails to dry out more, that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
      <li>This is just as good an African Black Soap as any other high quality product, however...&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
      <li>price is very affordable, actually cheaper than the dudu osun soap.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So far I like the results, but it&#x27;s too soon to tell if that&#x27;s a longterm use for the soap for me.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t rub it directly on your skin, as it does have tiny particles in it that could irritate soft skin -- rub it in your hands and then rub the lather over your skin.</li>
      <li>It also makes my hair look amazing if I slow down enough while showering to use this bar instead of a liquid shampoo.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is very economical as a small amount goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m right</li>

    <li> Immediately opening the packaging I could tell this was the real deal. This black soap looks good enough to eat (please don&#x27;t). I have acne and psoriasis flare ups, after only a few days of using this soap it seems to clear up. Haven&#x27;t got through the 1st block and already ordered a 2nd just to have it on hand.</li>
    <li> I was provided a sample product for my unbiased and honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the real deal. Before, I had used Dudu Osun, but the ingredients were not the best for people with sensitive skin. (things like lemon juice, lime juice, artificial fragrances)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is 100% natural and perfect for people with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is very affordable, actually cheaper than the dudu osun soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes in a dark and protective bag, when using, just slice off a block of soap and put the rest in the bag for future use.</li>
    <li> It cleanse and moisturize my skin. Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> This soap is wonderful.  It gives a natural clean without chemicals and fragrance.  It is very economical as a small amount goes a long way. I rub the top of the soap with wet shower gloves to work up a nice soft lather.  This soap does not leave my skin dry but I do occasionally use coconut oil after bathing for super smooth skin.</li>
    <li> It was well worth the money. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now. I bought it to treat the acne on my face and it has definitely worked. Awesome product. I would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> I thought that this soap was fantastic. The packaging made it very convenient to store it, and it lasted me for a good while, I&#x27;m still not done with it. Very good quality.</li>
    <li> I used Ivory soap my whole life, because it was &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; and other soaps full of perfumes and coloring made me break out. Until I realized that Ivory is also full of chemicals! So in a quest for pureness, I stumbled on this soap. Doesn&#x27;t get much more pure than ash and oil. I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now and I LOVE it. It has a lovely mild scent to it. It lathers beautifully. And it feels great on the skin. My skin type is very oily. If you have dry skin it may be too drying, or you may need to follow with a moisturizer. I actually don&#x27;t find it as stripping as the Ivory. Don&#x27;t rub it directly on your skin, as it does have tiny particles in it that could irritate soft skin -- rub it in your hands and then rub the lather over your skin. It lathers so well, you won&#x27;t have any problems spreading it all over. I just started diluting it with tea to use as a shampoo, too. So far I like the results, but it&#x27;s too soon to tell if that&#x27;s a longterm use for the soap for me. Either way, I&#x27;m sold on it as a body and face soap. I will be buying again, though it will be a while. A little goes a long way (I keep most of it in the fridge, and about a week&#x27;s worth is kept just outside the shower in a soap container). My order will probably last another two months, easy.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!! I have been using this soap for face and body for the last year and my skin feels and looks great!! I am 51 and think this is a wonderful product for aging skin as it provides deep cleaning with mild exfoliating properties. My skin feels soft and smooth and fine wrinkles seem less visible since I&#x27;ve starting using this soap.  Although I would have occassional breakouts prior to using black soap, I no longer experience any breakouts! Wonderful product! Price is very reasonable and ships quickly!</li>
    <li> This is so good, leaves skin clean, soft and hydrated. Would never use regular soap again.</li>
    <li> This is just as good an African Black Soap as any other high quality product, however...&lt;br /&gt;Most african black soaps are drying. Even the ones that have 30% or more of Shea Butter. I believe that the reason to this is that the recipe allows incorporation of the shea butter after the soap is made. So what the shea butter puts on your skin, the soap removes. In a traditional soap making recipe, the addition of oils and butters form a core part of the process and help produce a fatty soap and hence less drying. This one doesn&#x27;t feel like that. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m right but my experience with the soap is just that.&lt;br /&gt;But if you&#x27;re looking for a good quality african black soap, this one is. However, if you&#x27;re looking for a non drying african black soap, then you need to look elsewhere. And I&#x27;m not really sure you&#x27;d find it.</li>
    <li> Great soap for acne.  Not drying at all.  I love your soap!!!  I have tried other black soap, and it was very drying to the skin because it has no Shea Butter on it.  I will always use your soap.  Thank you for making this soap.  It is by far  the best I have used.</li>
    <li> Great soap...nothing bad to say</li>
    <li> Great product! I didn&#x27;t expect the lather to be so thick. I use it to wash my face and beard and surprisingly I&#x27;ve noticed less blackheads and breakouts. I love it.</li>
    <li> Made my face worst!!!</li>
    <li> Damn!  Have you tried this stuff?  Not like the dudu oson (?) stinky fake stuff.  You can tell this stuff is hand made and it is nice.  Great for soap recipes too.</li>
    <li> This soap is AMAZING!! I use it all over and on my face. I have some dry patches on my face but this has helped immensely. I can&#x27;t use the stuff with chemicals because my face will get red. This soap is the solution! I will be ordering more very soon. I haven&#x27;t experienced this kind of clean with any store bought brand. I appreciate this cruelty free and animal free product that is saving my body and face!</li>
    <li> Good quality and lasts forever. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase. Great for sensitive skin. Does not cure any skin issues, but won&#x27;t aggravate existing conditions. This is a pure, unscented bar soap.</li>
    <li> Great soap. I don&#x27;t like the usual commercial soap. They are too hard on my skin and our climate in a very dry high desert region is dry enough as it is. I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to know if it will moisturize my skin.. If it just fails to dry out more, that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
    <li> I love this soap!  It has cleared up and brightened my acne-prone skin without drying it out.</li>
    <li> I love washing my face with this.</li>
    <li> Awesome! I wish I had bought some sooner. Doing wonders for my son&#x27;s eczema and my daughter&#x27;s acne. Great bar of soap for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love. This soap is the nicest I&#x27;ve tried. It also makes my hair look amazing if I slow down enough while showering to use this bar instead of a liquid shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does get melty/mushy when wet, and I haven&#x27;t yet found a soap dish I love that drains appropriately. I tried cutting several bars and leaving them out in a dry location in hopes that this would make them dry out and cure (don&#x27;t know if it will work, but the bars do seem harder).</li>
    <li> I loved this soap, it is very gentle on my skin. I use it even on my hair! Will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> My new favorite full body soap. Perfection in a bar, do yourself a favor and buy this soap, especially if you live in the cold weather. The best, it does wonders.</li>
