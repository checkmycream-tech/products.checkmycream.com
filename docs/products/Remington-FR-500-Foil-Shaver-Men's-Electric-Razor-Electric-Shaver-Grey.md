      <li>but he was raving about this all day and has been completely delighted with its results, and has begun recommending it to his friends with said issue.</li>
      <li>A good portable razor.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good razor.</li>
      <li>However, it does give a good, close shave.</li>
      <li>This was a good choice for an electric shaver.</li>
      <li>&#x27;s start with the good things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It did take a good while to get use to as I said because it&#x27;s not like a one pass</li>
      <li>Works good.</li>
      <li>It gave me a good shave.  </li>
      <li>It has a good feel in your hands for grip.  </li>
      <li>and it never did a good job of getting the hairs off my face.  </li>
      <li>A good buy for the price.</li>
      <li>It gives good value for the money.</li>
      <li>He likes it and works well, good price..</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t even make a good paperweight.</li>
      <li>he loved</li>
      <li>Remington FR-500 is very easy to use and provides a good close shave.  </li>
      <li>the first shave he was impressed with how well the razor worked, and claimed it was the quietest one he&#x27;d ever used</li>
      <li>Works great, as advertised, and the washable components including the blade head are a huge bonus.</li>
      <li>If you dont mind having some parts of your face not feel smooth when touched, this thing is great.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Those are all nice pluses.  </li>
      <li>it did a nice job.  </li>
      <li>handy if it was being stored in your luggage.</li>
      <li>My husband was thrilled to receive this for Father&#x27;s Day.  </li>
      <li>and this did not cut that kind of hair too well</li>
      <li>Decent razor just not the greatest shave.</li>
      <li>I recommend you get this razor as its very easy to use and works well.</li>
      <li>Gets nice and close for a very smooth shave.</li>
      <li>This razor is not even good as a backup or travel razor even though it does not have a cheap price.</li>
      <li>but I love the way the charger light lets you know if you have a good charge.</li>
      <li>I liked how he can clean it with water!</li>
      <li>how easy it is to use, compact and sexy!</li>
      <li>I think most people would like this shaver;  and Remington is a name that has been around for some time, one that you can trust.  </li>
      <li>This razor probably shaves even closer than my Norelco, but it generates more heat and was rougher on my skin.</li>
      <li>I got a shrug, grimace, and &#x27;It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>OK, he has beard SPLOTCHES, and what I call &amp;#34;the dreaded throat beard&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I absolutely love using this.  </li>
      <li>Consequently if you have flatter face contours, the foil shaver may do better for you than it did for me.</li>
      <li>All in all, I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
      <li>It is ergonomically designed, sleek and stylish.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I purchased.</li>
      <li>best build quality of current Remington shavers (which isn&#x27;t saying much)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>More electric shavers should include this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Since the FR-500 doesn&#x27;t come with a charging station, just a plug adaptor, it&#x27;s nice to keep your outlets free and not need to have the razor plugged in during non-use.</li>
      <li>and  I have to shave more often</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not sure if we got a lemon or not, but who cares about the bells and whistles if the shaver itself doesn&#x27;t perform well?</li>
      <li>Nice smooth shave.</li>
      <li>I bought this for traveling purposes and it has served me well for the most.</li>
      <li>and I honestly could not tell which leg was shaved with which razor both legs were actually equally smooth.</li>
      <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The foil shaver is not one of my favorite types.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m liking this better every time I use it though.</li>
      <li>As with most of these razors the razor part works well</li>
      <li>I wish it had more juice</li>
      <li>for some reason he said that in order to turn the shaver off he had to switch the on/off switch more than once to turn it off.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t try to refurbish that.</li>
      <li>The reazor seems to do just an okay job of shaving.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Remington foil shavers for many years.  </li>
      <li>LOve</li>
      <li>However, on most of my face it gets so close</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not sure if we got a lemon or not, but who cares about the bells and whistles if the shaver itself doesn&#x27;t perform well?</li>
      <li>but I was planning to give it to my nephew as a birthday gift until he told me he prefers blades and more than 30 days have passed.</li>
      <li>it does a better job.</li>
      <li>Completely satisfied.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> excellent shaver best I ever had</li>
    <li> I have an old (probably 10 years old and paid twice as much) Panasonic electric razor that I went back to using after this thing ate my face. Even though I can&#x27;t get replacement blades for my old razor anymore it does a better job.</li>
    <li> I received it as expected. Worked as advertised. Thank you.</li>
    <li> My husband decided to give this Remington electric razor a try. And then I decided to see how it stacked up against my Lady Remington on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s start with the good things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BATTERY INDICATOR - this is a great feature! Since the FR-500 doesn&#x27;t come with a charging station, just a plug adaptor, it&#x27;s nice to keep your outlets free and not need to have the razor plugged in during non-use. No one wants a dead shaver, either, so it&#x27;s nice to have the indicator lights let you know when a charge is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOISE LEVEL - no electric razor is quiet, despite claims. But, the FR-500 is the quietest I&#x27;ve ever used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABILITY TO CLEAN - LOVE LOVE LOVE that this razor can be rinsed and cleaned out with water! The head is simple to remove and replace, making cleanup quick and easy! More electric shavers should include this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRIMMER - a very nice feature to have! Although, this is a bit of a con, too.  I thought the placement of the trimmer made the shaver a bit bulky and awkward to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FR-500 has some great points, but where it really counts, the shaver didn&#x27;t make the male or female of the house happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my husband finished shaving, I asked him what he thought. I got a shrug, grimace, and &#x27;It&#x27;s ok. It wouldn&#x27;t cut my neck.&#x27; It gave him a fairly smooth shave on his cheeks, but didn&#x27;t do a thing on his chin and neck area. So, for him, if an electric razor can&#x27;t do the whole job, why use it? He&#x27;s back to using the old fashioned stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard that men&#x27;s shavers are great for ladies&#x27; legs, so thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I normally use a Lady Remington, so didn&#x27;t think the FR-500 would be all that different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oy. It took FOREVER to shave my legs. Almost twice as long as it normally does with my Lady Remington. I had to keep going back over...back over...back over the same spots! And the pivoting head was just annoying. You&#x27;re not supposed to push hard with the shaver, so as not to damage the foils, but it felt like you needed to or no hairs would be cut!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if we got a lemon or not, but who cares about the bells and whistles if the shaver itself doesn&#x27;t perform well? It might work for a quick cleanup of cheeks or knees, but no one in this house will use the FR-500 on a regular basis.s not to damage the foils, but it felt like you needed to or no hairs would be cut!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if we got a lemon or not, but who cares about the bells and whistles if the shaver itself doesn&#x27;t perform well? It might work for a quick cleanup of cheeks or knees, but no one in this house will use the FR-500 on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I have always shaved with a razor.  Never even attempted to use one of these before so this is my first experience with one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, over the last year, I have gotten sick of using the razor.  I always seem to get irritated skin.  So I started using a regular trimmer on my face for a week or two and I like that.  It left a five o clock shadow but I didnt mind that as my job has no issue with facial hair, and I thought it looked good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, that would leave me without any burn or anything bad that usually goes along with shaving.  However, it would feel scratchy when using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, after using this I would say I am a convert.  The one drawback people always have with these is that they don&#x27;t get close enough.&lt;br /&gt;Indeed they are correct, it definitely does not get as close as a razor in all areas.  However, on most of my face it gets so close, I am hard pressed to feel the difference between this and a razor.  Where I can feel (not see) stubble is in areas like under my chin, near my neck.  I find that it takes a few passes there.  Also, if your the type to go a little long before shaving, this will definitely not work well.  Longer hairs seem to laugh at this machine.  However, if you use it everyday, its a quick clean shave.  If you dont mind having some parts of your face not feel smooth when touched, this thing is great.  Its not like you can see any hair.&lt;br /&gt;If you mind, then yes, you still don&#x27;t want this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for me, its currently right up my alley.&lt;br /&gt;I think I will be using this for a long time.  I may even see about getting one of those with the three heads and see what those feel like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I have been told that some people also get irritated skin from these.  This is not the case with me.  However, I have noticed if I linger on a spot for a while and keep going over it to get some hair it will irritate that skin.  Just an FYI.</li>
    <li> very good, wonderful shopping</li>
    <li> Works good. About the same as any other brand I have ever tried. Found myself still using my razors as this doesn&#x27;t get close enough.</li>
    <li> This is my husbands second one (he misplaced the cord on the first). He loves it!</li>
    <li> Disappointed my 10 yr old razor work better, leaves my face wt a five o&#x27;clock shadow</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t cut as close as I would like and  I have to shave more often</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband who pretty much detests electric shavers since he swears the shave is never as close as with a manual razor. Well after trying it out (just once) I think his opinion has not changed. While he liked the feel of the razor and how effortlessly he was able to shave with it, he (and I) could still feel the stubble mere minutes after he was done shaving. I know Remington to be a good, reliable brand and the razor does feel quite sturdy and certainly not flimsy or cheap. I guess it is all a matter of preference.</li>
    <li> The Remington FR-500 offers a close, comfortable shave without irritating sensitive skin.  My husband uses it to shave both his face and head and it does both well.  The battery gives about an hour of shaving time, at least when new.  He hasn&#x27;t had it long enough to know if the battery will last longer than a competitor&#x27;s (which lasted only about a year and no way to replace).  It is ergonomically designed, sleek and stylish.  Lights indicate the charge and are large and easy to see.</li>
    <li> I like trying different facial hair styles, and by extension experimenting with different shavers. This new Remington one proved to be slightly above average for good daily use, but lacks quality in other areas. I&#x27;ll try to summarize my experience with it into a topic based overview.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- First of all, daily usage grade: A&lt;br /&gt;While I did not get a perfectly smooth shave, I got a close enough one. It was easy to use, and finished the job fast. I cannot complain about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Handling week long (lazy) beards: F&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t even try it. If you let your beard go for a week or so, find something else to shave it, and stay 10 foot away from this one. I could literally feel my hairs pulled, and immediately gave up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Agony, and irritation: B&lt;br /&gt;After regular shaving, I did not have much irritation than any other shaver I had. During the shave itself, there were a few moments of very slight pain, thus I&#x27;m giving it a B instead of A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Build quality, and ease of use: C&lt;br /&gt;This shaver has a \\&quot;plasticy\\&quot; feel to its body. While it does not look very cheap, it does not have the same quality as a Phillips, or a Braun. Also, while the head moves (wiggles) for a smoother shave, it has no lateral motion, making the shaving of some of my finer face features more difficult than necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Accessories, and extras: B&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a fairly regular set of accessories: there is a charger, carrying pouch, and a cleaning brush. It also has a trimmer on its back, but I already have a dedicated one. My greatest complaint is the lack of charging dock, even my 7 years old Phillips had one (before it died).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a regular shaver with slightly over average features. My final score would be a B-, meaning I would not prefer this device to higher quality ones on the market, and would only recommend if you find it at a discount.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver! It has a broad shaving area (like a grill that painlessly accepts stubble) and trims close to the skin (bear in mind that no shaver will shave as close as a razor). It shaves uniformly allowing for a quick shave without missed spots. It is maybe just a bit louder than other shavers (I have very sensitive ears) but I love the way the charger light lets you know if you have a good charge. I wish other rechargeable devises had a similar display.</li>
    <li> The worst shave -- pulls hairs instead of cutting.  It doesn&#x27;t even make a good paperweight.</li>
    <li> For the past ten years I&#x27;ve just been using a trimmer.  But this works really well.  I also like how you can undo the top and run the blades under water to clean them.  It also has a nifty charging gauge that tells you went the device is charged.  There&#x27;s also a lock button so that you can stow it in your suitcase and not worry about it turning on in your bag.  I wish that they had this feature years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it today, and it worked great.  Took me a few moments to get used to it, but it didn&#x27;t cut me or pull at my face which I find that many of them do.  The head also bevels, too, to conform with your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a storage bag, brush for cleaning and a cord for charging the shaver.</li>
    <li> FIRST IMPRESSION: The Remington FR500 feels very lightweight compared to my Norelco 5861 (~10 years old, on its third set of cutters) but about the same as my Norelco 7310 [[ASIN:B001AJ6YS2 Philips Norelco 7310 Men&#x27;s Shaving System]]. One possible reason is that the power supply is now on the cord, as opposed to inside the shaver, making the shaver lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHAVING: The foil, as opposed to the rotary head, has a rectangular shape that is more suited to longer flat surfaces. The two blades go back and forth and the head pivots in one plane only, side to side. In the rotary, three circular heads pivot towards the center of three circles resulting in more angles being covered. Consequently if you have flatter face contours, the foil shaver may do better for you than it did for me. I shaved for a week with each one and measured how long it took to get a smooth shave. With the FR500 the average was 93 seconds, with the 5861 it was 72 seconds, or about 20% faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the shaver discussed have a pop out sideburns/beard trimmers. In the Norelco they are located close to the top of the shaver, while on the Remington it is closer to the middle of the shaver making accurate placement on the face somewhat awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BATTERY LIFE: The glossy ad brochure inside says 60 minutes to fully charge on one page, then 90 minutes on the flip side. The instructions say 90 mins, for the FR500, and 60 mins for the higher end models. They also say 35 min operating time and lasts 10 days. Guess they predict it will take you 3.5 min/shave, or over twice as long as it took me. That is an awful lot of running the shaver back and forth over your face and likely a reason why many people stay with razors. As a comparison the Norelco last me about 5 weeks before a recharge is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; CLEANING: The other big consideration with electric shavers is cleaning them. The rotary head when removed for cleaning removes the blades, subsequently when you tap the head on a hard sink surface, the majority of debris falls out. On the foil, you only get to remove the foil and not the blades. The blades have to be manually cleaned, they do not come off. On the other hand the FR500 and the 7310 are fully washable under running water, while the 5861 is not. I still think that the rotary will require at least a monthly cutter disassembly to clean out the lint and debris trapped inside. All come with storage pouches, cleaning brushes, and head covers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION: So overall as a foil shaver the FR500 is very capable, even if it doesn&#x27;t feel very solid in your hands. Both rotary and foil sytems will give you a close shave, but you may have to \\&quot;scrape\\&quot; your face longer with one than the other. How much you like it, and how well it shaves your face will likely depend on the contours of YOUR face.</li>
    <li> It is quiet. It works well except for the trimmer is not good. It also drops shavings out the sides when shaving unless you clean it EVERY day.</li>
    <li> Ta-da, it&#x27;s a shaver! Though I can&#x27;t speak to the specifics of this shaver&#x27;s \\&quot;advanced 3 stage cutting system,\\&quot; I can attest that it gives a nice clean shave -- close enough, not too close for comfort. The design is sleek and snazzy. It&#x27;s easy to hold, it&#x27;s easy to clean. It has what I consider to be a great battery life -- 10+ days of shaving, which for me means recharging maybe once a month. And the price seems reasonable; a shaver of this quality (as I perceive it, in any case) would have cost over $100 a decade ago.</li>
    <li> This is a basic foil shaver.  Very lightweight and the plastic feels cheap.  Won&#x27;t shave well if hair is longer than 1/8 inch.  Nowhere near the quality Remington shavers used to be 10-15 years ago.</li>
    <li> I usually use a gillete fusion razor and am not that familiar with the electric shavers.  I was excited to get this and try it out though.  The reazor seems to do just an okay job of shaving.  I could still feel quite a bit of stubble even after going over my chin and neck area a couple of times.  The razor is very simple to clean and use.  I just wish that it did abetter job of removing hairs.  The razor also charges fairly fast and will go some time without recharging.  LOve that it does have a trimmer on the back side to trim sideburns.  Decent razor just not the greatest shave.</li>
    <li> I got this for my Dad who had a rotary electric razor that was getting old.  He has used the Remington FR-500 for a few weeks now, and though shiny and new, has gone back to the old one for a number of reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* He has a beard and found that the head of the razor wasn&#x27;t as flexible as he expected and found it hard to use in the areas he wanted to.  This might perform better for a person who wants a clean shave on the entire face who doesn&#x27;t have a beard, goatee, or mustache.&lt;br /&gt;*The flexing foils come out for cleaning but he felt that they didn&#x27;t really sit in there securely&lt;br /&gt;*On certain parts of his face he said that he still had slight stubble, even though he would go over the area more than once&lt;br /&gt;*And for some reason he said that in order to turn the shaver off he had to switch the on/off switch more than once to turn it off.  I don&#x27;t know if this was part of the design (he didn&#x27;t read the instruction manual) or if it is a design flaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that there are more expensive, and less expensive electric razors out there, but at around $80 I did expect it to perform better than it did.</li>
    <li> I got this for the Mr. and we could not have been less impressed. He&#x27;s the kind of guy who can skip a day with a normal razor if you don&#x27;t mind a bit of a Don Johnson look, but this looked like he needed a shave the minute he was done. In fact, there was so much under-stubble that his cheeks looks black. I&#x27;ve never seen him look like that before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We thought it might be good for his sensitive skin, but it failed on that account also. When he gave up,I tried it on my legs, and it left a long scratchy trail where it rubbed against my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to hold and doesn&#x27;t take much room to store---that&#x27;s the best we can say about it. Definitely would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a very good razor. Being that I&#x27;ve never used an electric razor before its taken me some time to get used to this razor but having used it several times now, I can honestly say I wish I had gotten one earlier. I recommend you get this razor as its very easy to use and works well.</li>
    <li> not a satisfactory nshave...noisy and not smooth...my old Norelco seemed to do better.</li>
    <li> My Remington FR-500 shaver just came in. It has a good feel in your hands for grip.  When you turn it on it has lights that are in the handle that show how much battery life is left.  It gave me a good shave.  I am used to a norelco so I will have to use this one a few days like the manual says to get used to it.  I would say the Norelco is a little bit smoother.  This one for cleaning it says to run it under the fauct, water, to clean it out.  I am not a big fan of that. I assume it will not clog your drain , but I don&#x27;t want to risk it.  I think most people would like this shaver;  and Remington is a name that has been around for some time, one that you can trust.  I will give it a 4 star for now.</li>
    <li> The FR-500 is one of three models of Remington in-line electric shavers, the others being the slightly more expensive FR-730 and the FR-750. I recently reviewed the FR-730, and I can honestly say that the differences between these two models are minimal. Whereas the 750 has three blades (presumably giving a closer shave but I haven&#x27;t reviewed that model), both the 730 and the 500 have two in-line blades which give a decent shave, though certainly not as close as you get with a manual blade. They also both have charge gauges, and they are very similar in weight, look, and size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the differences are actually in favor of the less expensive 500 model. For example, the shaver itself has a \\&quot;lock\\&quot; feature on the power button, and it also comes with a gratis travel pouch. The only downside, as far as I can see, is that the 500 takes 30-minutes longer to fully charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said about the 730, I would certainly recommend this electric shaver. It seems well-built, it&#x27;s fairly easy to clean, it&#x27;s convenient, and it gives a shave comparable to electric shavers in its price-range. And unless the battery charge-time really matters a lot to you, II would recommend the 500 over the 730. Not only is a little bit less expensive, it also has a couple extras.</li>
    <li> It works just fine, but I used it three times and sold it to a friend. He&#x27;s very happy with it. No problem at all with closeness, or missing hairs, and the charge indicator feature is very nice. This unit has the dual foil and pivoting head, which actually just made it harder for ME to shave the back of my neck- which was the true reason I bought it. I really wanted a single foil- non pivoting head, like the Braun I dropped last month... Fussy, fussy. It seems like the single foils are reserved now to the battery-only operated, which I did purchase- namely the Panasonic one. I will be reviewing that model shortly. There&#x27;s also the Povos model- rechargeable...but that is unrated. If it should not work out, and I HAD to purchase another dual foil, I WOULD go back to this Remington without hesitation. It is a quality product, just takes a little more carefulness for my needs.</li>
    <li> My husband got this for a Christmas gift and he loves it!</li>
    <li> This shaver works better than I expected for the price I paid. The only compliant that I have is that it tugs hard on your skin if you growth is beyond a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
    <li> pros:&lt;br /&gt;- overall close shave&lt;br /&gt;- best build quality of current Remington shavers (which isn&#x27;t saying much)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;- the plastic edging of the foils dug into my face as I shaved, so it was very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;- though a close overall shave, a design flaw in the plastic edging on the foils made in impossible to get a comfortable shave. no go.</li>
    <li> I really like this razor.  It is quieter than my old Remington and, after the adjustment period, I believe it gives a very close shave without any irritation.  It stays charged for 5-6 days and recharges very fast.  All in all, I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This was a good choice for an electric shaver. Excellent price, it is much quieter than other ones I have owned. Smooth buying experience, would purchase from seller again.</li>
    <li> After only 6 times using this shaver it felt like the hairs on my neck were being ripped out, never a close shave, my old rotary 12 yr. old Norelco did a better job . highly disappointed . DON&#x27;T waste your $$</li>
    <li> My husband says he&#x27;s had better shaves with other models. It didn&#x27;t allow for as clean of a shave as he&#x27;s accustomed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good razor. First electric for me and I&#x27;m glad I purchased.</li>
    <li> as advertised. maybe a little better than expected</li>
    <li> A good portable razor.  Flex screen not quite as fast as rotary heads, but eventually cuts the stubble.</li>
    <li> Works great, as advertised, and the washable components including the blade head are a huge bonus. Easy to clean and use daily.</li>
    <li> Is a great razor for the money.  Was a great buy .</li>
    <li> I gave this to my husband as a gift. It works pretty well, but is not a totally clean shave. The side trim is handy and the movable head is cool.</li>
    <li> Great Shaver - quick to charge and charge lasts quite a long time. I am very happy with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend buying.</li>
    <li> Well, my son just turned 14 ... and has a beard ... OK, he has beard SPLOTCHES, and what I call &amp;#34;the dreaded throat beard&amp;#34;. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor blades intimidate him just a bit, but this Remington is just perfect for him. He plugged it in right away and shaved. THANK YOU, REMINGTON!</li>
    <li> This is a a very good electric shaver.  The charge lasts a long time and it is easy to clean w/wo water.  Gives a good shave, so much so that I opt for it many times over my traditional razor.</li>
    <li> Having used a razor and shaving creme for 40 years, I really, really wanted this to work.  Alas, it does not give a stubble-free shave unless you spend about 20 minutes with it.  Had to send it back.</li>
    <li> This replaces a dull corded three-head shaver. I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t try to refurbish that. I cleaned it up like new and donated it to Salvation Army. I should feed guilty about the fooled taker of a freebie. I now have a better life for a tiny investment. I like the two long cutting rows vs. little heads. It shaves smooth, quickly. The first charge seemingly will never fade.</li>
    <li> After about three passes its smooth</li>
    <li> Very Good Shaver. Completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Remington FR-500 is very easy to use and provides a good close shave.  I would rather have had the rotating head but that my preference. Shipping was fast and it arrived in good shape.  A good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect too much because I&#x27;m strictly a lather and razor guy.  I shave my head as well,  This shaver really surprised me.  I don&#x27;t use it all the time but it&#x27;s great for occasional touch ups before going to dinner when you don&#x27;t want to get into the whole lather thing in the shower.</li>
    <li> Works great and I don&#x27;t even need a razor after 1 going over</li>
    <li> Razor arrived on time and in new condition. The trimmer is great. Like the portability of a cordless razor.</li>
    <li> Useless for a coarse beard.  Waste of money.  Husband had to go back to old razor until it can be replaced.</li>
    <li> Just like other reviews mentioned. Need to use everyday. Very good if you use it that ways. Even two day of stubble makes this unusable, it tugs painfully.</li>
    <li> Does not do the job well.&lt;br /&gt;Often, I have to use a common razor to get the shave well done.&lt;br /&gt;Kind of gave up on it, after a couple of months.</li>
    <li> Close shave/shape up. Hubby loves it. Spends less money on the Barber and more time relaxing at home.</li>
    <li> I first owned a Remington shaver 25 years ago, and the products still have the same level of quality today that they did back then. I&#x27;m something of a shaver/trimmer nut, owning 5 or 6 different types. The foil shaver is not one of my favorite types. It always feels too fragile to me, and this model is no different. However, it does give a good, close shave. I prefer the shave given by a rotary-head shaver (the typical Norelco type), because it&#x27;s easier on my skin. This razor probably shaves even closer than my Norelco, but it generates more heat and was rougher on my skin. For those whose skin isn&#x27;t as sensitive, however, this is worth checking out.</li>
    <li> New out of the box and fully charged it was pulling hair more than cutting it.  I went back to my old Panasonic razor with 2 year old blades and got a better shave.  This razor is not even good as a backup or travel razor even though it does not have a cheap price. I would return it but I was planning to give it to my nephew as a birthday gift until he told me he prefers blades and more than 30 days have passed.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this shaver. I am a big Remington fan but this shaver does not shave close at all.  My husband didn&#x27;t like it and went back to his old one.  I have to go over and over to remove the hair on my legs. The charge holds a long time and its a good thing because you have to go over the same spot for a long time. I didn&#x27;t  try to return it. I am sure amazon would give excellent service but I just didn&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> I have always had a 3 headed razor so this is the first \\&quot;foil\\&quot; razor I have owned.  It worked well and adjusted tot he contour of my chin and skin.  The charge lasts a very long time and what seemed like much longer than previous razors.  As with most of these razors the razor part works well but the trimmer part not so much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same Braun shaver for several years and it has served me well.  But it&#x27;s starting to break down a bit and I have been looking for a replacement.  I like the shape of the FR-500, as the thinner body is more comfortable to hold than my wide-bodied Braun.  The battery indicator is useful.  I find that the battery life is at least as good as advertised.  I think it lasts longer.  I get roughly 10-14 days of use per charge.  And it&#x27;s pretty easy to clean.  Certainly a lot easier than my Braun.  The trimmer works about as well as you would expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those are all nice pluses.  But how well does it shave?  This is where it&#x27;s just so-so.  Right out of the box it did a nice job.  But pretty quickly it started to degrade in performance.  It doesn&#x27;t do a bad job.  It just started taking considerably longer to get a good clean shave.  One issue is that there is no way to prevent the head from pivoting.  I find that I get a better shave from a non-pivoting shaver, especially under the chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instruction book refers to a pivot lock and says it comes with cleaning brush and headguard.  But the model pictured in the instructions is a different model (must be the 730 or 750).  The 500 does not have a pivot lock.  At least not that I could find.  And mine didn&#x27;t come with a cleaning brush or headguard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not been able to identify which is the correct replacement foil for this model and how much it costs.  I don&#x27;t need a replacement yet but that kind of affects the overall rating of this product.  But without knowing that, I would give it 3 stars for shaving and 4 stars for features, for an overall rating of 3.5 stars.</li>
    <li> I had other shavers, but no one works like this one. I totally recommend you this one, it is really for men&#x27;s beard.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my son.  He said it works great.  Nice smooth shave. No redness or bumps on his face anymore.</li>
    <li> I just bought one. Received it in 3 days. It is light weight and quieter than any I have ever used. However, after fully charging it I was only able to shave three times before it ran down. I recharged it again and will send it back if it doesn&#x27;t do better than three shaves on a charge. It did give a good close shave.</li>
    <li> My husband was thrilled to receive this for Father&#x27;s Day.  Charges FAST!</li>
    <li> I have been using Remington foil shavers for many years.  My current MS2-280 is showing its age so, after reading the reviews, I cautiously decided to purchase the FR-500.  I really wanted to like the shaver.  It is quieter than the MS2-280, easy to handle and is easy to clean.  After two weeks I decided to return the shaver.  To get anywhere near the same quality of shave as the MS-280 I had to shave significantly longer (at least twice as long), going over the chin and neck areas again and again and again.  Even on the flat cheek areas the MS2-280 easily out-shaved the FR-500.  Ultimately, the frustration with using this shaver was just too great and it needed to go back.  As always, dealing with Amazon was wonderful.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for my husband.  My husband didn&#x27;t want anything too complicated and this works perfect for him and it works great.</li>
    <li> I first gave this only two stars because I wasn&#x27;t use to it and I was trying to use it like a regular shaver. After using it for a while now and getting use to how to use it, it is a pretty darn good shaver especially for an electric. I&#x27;m a wet razor gal and tried these in the past and got tired of the stubble they left behind and the delicate places being cut but this one doesn&#x27;t cut or pinch at all! It did take a good while to get use to as I said because it&#x27;s not like a one pass and it&#x27;s smooth like a wet shave. You have to use short up and down or circular motions over the area several times and it does give a close smooth result but it takes a little more effort. The thing I like is that I can use it while watching TV sitting on the couch rather then using tons of water in the shower. After getting use to the motion and how to best make it work I did one leg in the shower with a regular shaver and the other with this electric FR-500 and I honestly could not tell which leg was shaved with which razor both legs were actually equally smooth. This really surprised me. I don&#x27;t shave the blond soft hair on my upper leg and this did not cut that kind of hair too well but it does work very well on regularly shaved thicker hair. It does take a long time to get use to but give it a good chance before giving up, it does work great when you get use to it but it takes some practice and a little more time! I&#x27;m liking this better every time I use it though.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this I cleaned the blades with the included brush and one of the 2 blade attachments fell in the trash can and I didn&#x27;t hear it fall off, so now I am stuck with a 1 blade electric razor.I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF IT IS POSSIBLE TO BUY JUST 1 OF THE BLADE DEVICE&#x27;S?</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend and his face has never been smoother. Some men of color have problems with razor bumps and this was his case in the past but he was raving about this all day and has been completely delighted with its results, and has begun recommending it to his friends with said issue. He loves the smoothness and closeness of the shave and how easy it is to use, compact and sexy! Great price and buy, try it for sure, get it for your man, ladies!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my 17 year old Xmas.  He has like 10 hairs.  But this made him smile!  Am not sure how it would do on full beard lol</li>
    <li> My dad has used electric razors for most of my life, so he can access one pretty much in one shave, as to how long it will last and ease of use. His old razor was just about done for when this one came in, so it was really great timing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the first shave he was impressed with how well the razor worked, and claimed it was the quietest one he&#x27;d ever used (in fact we didn&#x27;t even hear him using it, one room over, so you KNOW it&#x27;s quiet!). The battery lasted really well after the initial charge and mom loved the fact that it didn&#x27;t have a stand charger to take up space on their sink counter. In fact, the corded charger means it is easier to take it on the go as well- always a plus! he loved the battery indicator- said it was the easiest one to see he&#x27;d ever had. It gave him a pretty smooth shave. He said it handled well- he has large hands, so it wasn&#x27;t awkward to him. The pop up trimmer was a little different, and after an initial getting used to it, it was easy to use as well. He also really loved how simple it was to clean and how everything came apart easily- some razors you have to struggle with, but not this one! I liked how he can clean it with water! The two flexible foils was also a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like this razor will last and it will be interesting to see how it holds up, as he&#x27;s only used it for a month, but so far so good! He definitely recommends it as a Father&#x27;s Day/Birthday/Christmas present!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I was a little skeptical about an American-made shaver (vs. the Braun razors I&#x27;ve had for a couple of decades now), but this one is really excellent. Shaves close, no razor burn (at least for me -- though I admittedly don&#x27;t have a heavy beard). The one thing I don&#x27;t particularly care for is the sideburn trimmer, which seems only adequate to me, but other than that, this has been a great product for me.</li>
    <li> My husband used this razor for 2 weeks.  The following are my questions to him and his responses.  The razor has a couple of good points but overall did not leave a good impression.  His usual shaving routine is weekdays with the occasional weekend shave.  He stopped using this razor after the 2 weeks.  Definitely not for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Does it provide a close shave?  Compared to a blade?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It provides an adequately close shave if used on at least a daily basis.  If you have a couple days of growth, forget about it. I tried once after missing a day and stopped immediately.  You may have some luck if you don&#x27;t mind spending a lot of time and tolerating unnecessary pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Easy to move around contours? Flexible?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no problems moving this razor to all parts of my face and neck.  I had expected more flexibility, but I don&#x27;t really have any complaints.  It performed sufficiently in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Ease of use?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging is straightforward.  The battery charge LED&#x27;s are large and easy to see, so you&#x27;ll always know when it needs to be charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Easy to clean?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is effortless to clean.  The top opens easily and the hair particles fall right out.  If required, you can run under the faucet to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Worth $80? (Price when product was received)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to me. I&#x27;d rather use a blade. It&#x27;s much less time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Extras&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no use for the locking power switch, but I can see where it could come in handy if it was being stored in your luggage.</li>
    <li> My guy really likes these clippers. He said they work great. He likes to keep his goatee shaped up and clean cut on a regular so this is perfect or him. It is preferable over the razors that he&#x27;s been using. He can shape it up and be done with his morning routine in no time flat.</li>
    <li> Reliable and functional shaver, comfortable and close shave. Rechargeable battery is nice, provides adequate power to get in a full shave plus. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> I bought this for convenience when traveling, not for daily at-home shaving. Normally I shave with a double-edged razor. Keeping in mind that no electric razor seems to give me as close and rapid a shave as a manual razor, I feel that for an electric this Remington does an excellent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Excellent grip.&lt;br /&gt;2. The trim feature is super efficient.&lt;br /&gt;3. The \\&quot;fuel gauge\\&quot; is practical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Unless my face is absolutely dry, the razor will tug at my beard. So if you shave right after you shower, drying your face with a towel, you won&#x27;t get a comfortable shave. Give your face the time it needs to dry thoroughly before shaving.&lt;br /&gt;2. If I am not careful when I remove the plastic head-protector, the foil will come off, sometimes jumping out and landing on the floor or in the sink.</li>
    <li> I really like this new razor and the price I paid was so reasonable on my kindle &amp;#34;deal of the day&amp;#34; through Amazon!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have used &amp;#34;Remington electric razors for many years and I always have to buy MEN&#x27;S razors because  I am an Italian female and I UNFORTUNATELY inherited my heavy thick hairy legs from my Italian Mom!  I thought after turning 50 the hairs would thin-out but I was wrong!  You men out there who have heavy thick beards should love this razor because if it can shave both of my legs and still not run out of battery life then it can certainly do your little face area!!!  Women&#x27;s razors are just not as good as men&#x27;s.  I never could understand why Remington does NOT come out with a women&#x27;s LOOKING razor that can work for us women who have hair on their legs as course as a man&#x27;s beard!  I highly recommend this razor to all men and women...</li>
    <li> I have had excellent results with this shaver. It&#x27;s quick and easy to use and I especially like the easy cleaning method. It gives good value for the money.</li>
    <li> I really like this razor.  My fianc&amp;eacute; has a beard and moustahe and he used to think all you had to do was grow the facial hair and that was that.  You do need to trim it.  Trimming your facial hair, shaping it separates a good looking man from a mountain man.  However, he doesn&#x27;t like to trim it himself, so I do it.  This razor makes it a snap.  The regular blades are for the neck and yes gentlemen the hairline.  The smaller trimmer is for trimming those lose hairs, long hairs, side burns, moustahe, and tight spaces.  I absolutely love using this.  When the little blade is out the large one stops working.  You can lock the razor to &#x27;on&#x27; so that you can either do quick zip trims without locking the razor on, or you can lock the razor on to shave your whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are easy to change.  There is no tugging on the facial hair or face which is a complaint my fella has had in the past about electric razors.</li>
    <li> my husband really likes his new razor,it was well worth the money</li>
    <li> I bought this for traveling purposes and it has served me well for the most. I like the light design and simple/slick look. It is good for daily shaving meaning when it is short and stubby. However, after a day or two, then I need to either use a razor because it just does not have that much power to cut through the longer and thicker hair. I will use it for now but I need something more powerful. By the way, I&#x27;m an Asian guy with very little hair.</li>
    <li> it is the worst shaver ever..... does not even come CLOSE to shaving.... worst purchase I have ever made. I shave my handicapped son and this is money we did not have to spend on something that is a piece of crap.</li>
    <li> Great shave, long battery life, quiet. If I don&#x27;t shave for a few days, I use Harry&#x27;s, check them out, great shave, great price, then the Remington to finish up. Never had a hair get pulled while shaving with the Remington.</li>
    <li> Works well on my beard and cordless feature very convenient on the go.</li>
    <li> Useless. It just doesn&#x27;t shave. Shaved with something else just to see if it would even do a little stubble and it doesn&#x27;t. Bought for husband and returned.</li>
    <li> great product, great seller!</li>
    <li> As advertised, fast shipment, original factory part, terrific value, will for sure be ordering again as needed, do recommend everyone give them a try.</li>
    <li> does what an electric razor should</li>
    <li> The shaver part works well. Gets nice and close for a very smooth shave. I wish it had more juice so I didn&#x27;t have to charge it as often. The pop up trimmer just yanked hair out, but I have another trimmer for that type of use.</li>
    <li> This is a terrible shaver.  Tried using it for three weeks and it never did a good job of getting the hairs off my face.  Would have to go over the same spots 5 or 6 times to get all the hairs, and that leads to irritation.  The shaver also FEELS cheaply made, with cheap plastic parts and a light feel.</li>
    <li> One of the best shaves I have ever had!</li>
    <li> it is very noisy and not so good as my expected.the delivery service  in China was not satisfied to me, i have to take my stuff by myself from carrier. :(</li>
    <li> Gave this to grandson at xmas, first razor.. He likes it and works well, good price..</li>
