      <li>It’s seriously effective and a great wrinkle reducer because they use the science of DNA rejuvenation, so it  works against the natural signs of aging.</li>
      <li>’s feet around my eyes looked better.</li>
      <li>Where the heck do you find that anymore?! :)</li>
      <li>I was that pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>thank you so much, sincerely, JP</li>
      <li>well I’d love to see what else they offer.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m really pleased.  </li>
      <li>I tried applying more makeup under and around the corners of my eyes.</li>
      <li>I think it might be the snake venom that is the magic ingredient.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product!  </li>
      <li>For the elite eye serum that I used, there were even more</li>
      <li>I’m totally pleased with this discovery</li>
      <li>I just can&#x27;t afford to experiment and gamble my money any more</li>
      <li>and I’ve already noticed that my eye area is looking more refreshed and relaxed.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m glad I did-</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>They didn&#x27;t work, but I was satisfied that I made an effort to try them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The more I researched; the more I understood its focus.</li>
      <li>I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My husband is very pleased as well, he could not believe how quickly it worked.</li>
      <li>Her skin did look great, particularly around her eyes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been fortunate in that at forty three I have for the most part been aging gracefully.  </li>
      <li>I suggest you take a photo of yourself before and after using the product to convince yourself that it is really you, looking gorgeous all over again.</li>
      <li>This DNA eye serum is a product that I recommend to everyone because it truly gives you the best results compared to dozens of other brands that I have used.</li>
      <li>The texture applies well to my skin and it absorbs easily.</li>
      <li>DNA serum is really easy to use, too.</li>
      <li>The serum is easy to apply with your fingers by just dabbing around the eyes.</li>
      <li>I like this stuff a lot since it is really easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Liked it from the first day I started using it.  </li>
      <li>I like the product ,works well softening lines on my eyes fairly quickly ,but the syringe was not sealed and the cap was loose in the package,otherwise very happy with product.</li>
      <li>It seemed a bit exotic at first and I was hesitant, but he pointed out that I haven&#x27;t been satisfied with anything</li>
      <li>The fine lines smoothened; the puffiness retracted and added freshness to my face.</li>
      <li>In fact, I didn&#x27;t even realize there was a problem with her face in the first place, but she&#x27;s so much more content and satisfied with her looks</li>
      <li>Even though there are a lot of products on the market that promise to eliminate fine lines and wrinkles, I haven’t found any that work like DNA Serum Temple Viper Venom.</li>
      <li>The serum helped reduce my wrinkles and fine lines, along with improving the firmness of my skin.</li>
      <li>None of these do, they all sound like an infomercial...</li>
      <li>as far as my experience with Amazon, they are consistently good on their promised delivery date</li>
      <li>Honestly, I feel the same, but now I just think they notice, which is a nice compliment.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to look as young as you feel:)</li>
      <li>There is a natural glow on my complexion that beams of self-confidence and happiness.</li>
      <li>it’s an easy and successful addition to my daily beauty routine.</li>
      <li>And the best part is that the skin doesn&#x27;t get stiff like my sister&#x27;s did after Botox.</li>
      <li>DNA Serum has more of an impact that the Botox on the wrinkles and in additon, has greatly improved the dark circles and bags.  </li>
      <li>serum is very easy to apply and it seems to moisturize very well</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a complete steal for the price, I&#x27;m very satisfied with my results.</li>
      <li>Now that I&#x27;ve FINALLY gone through the whole tube, I&#x27;m completely satisfied with what I&#x27;ve experienced with this product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a complete steal for the price, I&#x27;m very satisfied with my results.</li>
      <li>I started applying the product on in the morning and in the nighttime as well, and after about 20 days, I started see a significant change in my skin.</li>
      <li>I noticed significant results within a couple weeks and this is what I will be using form now on.</li>
      <li>SkinPro is an amazing company from my experience so far and the DNA Serum is available at a price I could not refuse.  </li>
      <li>After using this serum, which is very easy to apply not having to worry about a mud mask mess to clean up, I have realized incredible results; my eyes look a lot younger and definitely more awake in the morning.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so much cheaper, safer and more convenient than Botox.</li>
      <li>True.</li>
      <li>My eyes look good and that makes me look younger --</li>
      <li>True.</li>
      <li>This product is great because it gets rid of my problem and lasts a lot longer than other wrinkle creams.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied and have people telling me that I&#x27;m more energetic lately.</li>
      <li>I look and feel more vibrant and well rested.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> A few years ago, I began to notice that I looked tired a lot, even on nights I&#x27;d gotten plenty of sleep. I tried applying more makeup under and around the corners of my eyes. But after a while, it just looked like I was caking on the makeup and I still looked tired. I tried a few of the eye cremes, but they were super expensive and weren&#x27;t really giving me the results I wanted. My older sister kept telling me to get Botox injections like she did. Her skin did look great, particularly around her eyes. But they also had that frozen, stiff Botox look, which I absolutely wanted to avoid. I started searching for Botox alternatives and kept coming across Temple Viper Venom because it contains similar ingredients. I didn&#x27;t believe topical cremes would ever work for me, but since this one seemed to have so much in common with Botox, I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m so glad I did. I could feel it working after only a few days. The skin around my eyes seemed tighter and firmer. It&#x27;s corny, but feeling the skin get tighter actually made me feel rejuvenated. I applied twice a day - once after I showered in the morning before putting on makeup and again at night before bed. I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it worked. And the best part is that the skin doesn&#x27;t get stiff like my sister&#x27;s did after Botox. And applying it only twice a day, it even lasted longer than Bbotox. A few weeks into using Viper Venom, my sister even noticed a difference. She asked if I&#x27;d gotten Botox behind her back! I showed her the creme and explained the ingredients to her. She was skeptical, but she tried it and of course now she loves it too. It&#x27;s so much cheaper, safer and more convenient than Botox. Try it for yourself. If it doesn&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t worry, it comes with a satisfaction guarantee. You&#x27;ll absolutely love it. Don&#x27;t give up until you&#x27;ve tried it. Good luck!</li>
    <li> i guess its been about 2 weeks and im seeing very little results.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:52777c1878692d5a3f50f633f3966213]] This is Kami with OMG Goodies.  I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I love this product!  It feels wonderful on my eyes and between my eyebrows where I used it for this review! It is very soothing, and makes a difference in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I have used about everything for the creases on the corner of my eyes.  Expensive creams. Castor oil.  Avocado home remedies, even the caviar creams.  Every so often I would get a sudden improvement only to watch my creases come back to the surface.  I have used Google enough to know that ther is no \\&quot;cure\\&quot; for wrinkles.  I just want to kno that they aren&#x27;t so blatantin my case and making me look older.  As a sales agent, perception is everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a past customer of SkinPro,  i was alerted to this new formula early.  With the price I was offered, I figured why not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applied the serum twice each day.  After a couple weeks, I was starting to see improvement.  (Note: I only use this around the cornerofs of each eye and this product lasted for 4 months).  After two months, everyone was noticing it.  I&#x27;m on a health kick, which helps my overall complexion ( I&#x27;m drinking 120 oz. of water per day and really see a glow) and skin tone.  Now that I&#x27;ve FINALLY gone through the whole tube, I&#x27;m completely satisfied with what I&#x27;ve experienced with this product.  Nothing is a miracle or time machine, but for my eye wrinkles this is the closest thing I&#x27;ve found and I can whole heartedly recommend it to others looking to cure the same.</li>
    <li> I like the product ,works well softening lines on my eyes fairly quickly ,but the syringe was not sealed and the cap was loose in the package,otherwise very happy with product.</li>
    <li> Did not do anything as described</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much money I have wasted on beauty products that guarantee fewer wrinkles and better looking skin only to be disappointed when they don&#x27;t live up to the hype.  Just when I was ready to give up completely and accept the crows feet around my eyes as an irreversible aspect of aging, a friend of mine told me about DNA Serum.  Jaded, but hopeful I tried it and within a few weeks could tell the wrinkles around my eyes were diminishing.  Not only that, but the area under my eyes appeared smoother and brighter too, which was an added bonus.  Needless to say, I am no longer wasting my money on products that don&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies believe me when I say, DNA Serum is a must-have in your arsenal of beauty products.</li>
    <li> I ordered the DNA serum with the eye serum.  I use it at night, using the Elite serum during the day.  I love it and because of its ingredients I go beyond my under eye area and use it on expression lines around the mouth and lines above the brow.  Within one month I have seen lines diminish,  I can actually feel that something is happening under my skin causing a smoother look.  Use it NOW no matter what your age... this is a one of a kind skin care product........</li>
    <li> Even as a man, I am here to say this product is great and ideal for preventing and treating wrinkles. I&#x27;ve always had issues with the wrinkles on the sides of my eyes. I&#x27;ve felt like they age my by 10-15 years, and I&#x27;m still technically in my 20&#x27;s. So I&#x27;ve tried it all. Creams. Oils. And none of it worked. It&#x27;s been somewhat difficult for me to face as none of my male friends have had this issue or had a similar issue bother them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this being said, I got an email from a friend of my mothers stating that this may be the solution. It was recommended to her and it&#x27;s worked great and I thought it was worth giving it a shot. The price was a little higher than your typical creams, but it was well worth it. I noticed significant results within a couple weeks and this is what I will be using form now on. The best part? I also know that it is the best ANTI-WRINKLE product on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended if you&#x27;re in this market.</li>
    <li> It may seem a bit strange that a man would use this product; but stick with me here. I&#x27;ve been getting more and more wrinkles every year, as is expected with old age, and it didn&#x27;t really affect me until I went back through some older pictures and realized how much older I look. I stay active every day and don&#x27;t feel old, so I didn&#x27;t want to look old either. I&#x27;ve tried some other product that claim to get rid of wrinkles and smooth out the skin, but none really seemed to do the trick. However a few months ago a friend showed me this product. It seemed a bit exotic at first and I was hesitant, but he pointed out that I haven&#x27;t been satisfied with anything else.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really realize how much someone&#x27;s eyes define them, if that makes sense, but even if you only take away the wrinkles around someone&#x27;s eyes, they will look much younger. I would feel strange in my late 50&#x27;s walking around with a 25 year old face, so I&#x27;m glad this product is able to rejuvenate my look in a &#x27;non-invasive&#x27; way. I don&#x27;t have to attack my face with creams or injections. I just use it twice a day a the wrinkles are gone. I&#x27;m very satisfied and have people telling me that I&#x27;m more energetic lately. Honestly, I feel the same, but now I just think they notice, which is a nice compliment. And I can&#x27;t see myself going back to my old ways (pun intended)</li>
    <li> Couple things here. 1st, this company is smart because they know people generally trust amazon reviews. They start off with a bunch of fake 5-star reviews. For the elite eye serum that I used, there were even more I just didn&#x27;t realize it at the time. Key thing to check is if the review says &#x27;Amazon Verified Purchase&#x27;. None of these do, they all sound like an infomercial...so much that they should make you wonder. So what this company does next is sell a bunch of product at a really expensive price but has great fake reviews so the price looks worth it. As people buy and the negative reviews start to weigh out all the fake 5-star reviews they &#x27;re-formulate&#x27; their product, and &#x27;develop&#x27; a new one (obv I&#x27;m implying is the same exact product), but this lets them re-name it or put XL on the end - which lets a new round of fake reviews begin. Very expensive stuff, glorious reviews, unverified purchases from people that have been using &#x27;for a long time&#x27;. Also look at what else the reviewers have reviewed.</li>
    <li> Have used it faithfully And as instructed for about 5 weeks and I have seen absolutely no difference! Would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> What a coincidence that ALL of the reviews on here are well written and positive, and when clicking to see other products of the same reviews, they just happen to be products offered by the same company!  Amazing isn&#x27;t it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fell for this scam product and have not noticed one bit of difference after using it for 2 weeks.  If anything, i look worse under my eyes because i&#x27;ve stopped using other creams (that probably worked better).  BUYER BEWARE.</li>
    <li> Like most women  on the &#x27;other&#x27; side of 40 those lines at the corner of my eyes have been getting deeper and longer.  And that&#x27;s been getting me down -- have even found myself avoiding looking into the mirror. Especially cause I coudn&#x27;t see myself running to the Doctor every three months to get some toxin injected in my face (i.e. Botox).  But then I had lunch with a friend who I hadn&#x27;t seen in a few months -- and I noticed her skin was seriously smoother and brighter.  She had gone from being more wrinkled than me to less! Figured she was doing the Botox thing but no -- she said it was this product.  Really grilled her but she was very firm -- no surgeries or procedures were behind her suddenly refreshed look, just this DNA serum. So, yes, I went home and ordered some.  A month later and I felt like a walking infomercial. Now I look forward to looking in the mirror every morning -- my face looks just a bit softer and younger every day.  And I&#x27;m grateful. It&#x27;s nice to look as young as you feel:)</li>
    <li> I have tried tried many different products that claim to improve wrinkles around the eyes, and with SkinPro&#x27;s DNA serum I seem to have finally found one that shows promise. After a few weeks of use, I am seeing the kind of improvement I have been hoping for. Looking in the mirror I really feel like I look more refreshed and less tired than I used to. People seem to be noticing, too; the other day my roommate actually asked me if I had been using Botox! I told her about the serum and she could hardly believe the results I was getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DNA serum is really easy to use, too. I use it underneath and on the corners of my eyes twice a day. I ran into a friend I hadn&#x27;t seen in a long time after using it for a little more than a week, and he commented that I actually looked younger! I am really excited to have found a product that works, and for such a reasonable price. I am already recommending it to family and friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been fortunate in that at forty three I have for the most part been aging gracefully.  Unfortunately the lines and sagging around my eyes had slowly but surely become a dead give away to my real age.  About a year ago and at risk of sounding vain I started using several over the counter products but really saw little if any real result.  Botox was not an option for me both due to cost and quite honestly the needles.  Then I stumbled across DNA Serum.  Despite my skeptical nature I gave it a try and although I won&#x27;t kid you by saying the results were instantaneous, I will tell you that after only a couple of weeks I could see very profound results both with my wrinkles and in the decreased dryness of the skin around my eyes.  I&#x27;m getting ready to start my next syringe of DNA and can assure you I will be a customer for life.  Thank you DNA Serum.</li>
    <li> Up until a year ago, I really didn&#x27;t have wrinkles, but I found out the hard way that once you get them, it is extremely difficult to reverse it. I had tried many different wrinkle creams and anti aging products and then I heard about this DNA serum. It smoothed out my wrinkles and my face now has a more youthful appearance to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyes look brighter and the lines on my face are less noticeable. I just started using it and I&#x27;ve already seen such a huge difference. My husband is very pleased as well, he could not believe how quickly it worked. I do not like to wear makeup and now I can do that again and not worry about my wrinkles showing. I finally found a product that actually works and I am happy.</li>
    <li> Combating wrinkles is something many people, including myself, take into account when developing a skin care routine. After trying countless products that claimed to help improve the quality of my skin and never did, I gave up. I felt terribly insecure about my skin and when a friend recommended this DNA serum to me, I decided to give it a try. I started applying the product on in the morning and in the nighttime as well, and after about 20 days, I started see a significant change in my skin. The serum helped reduce my wrinkles and fine lines, along with improving the firmness of my skin. This product is great and the benefits gained from using this eye serum are incredible. I&#x27;m very happy that I don&#x27;t need to feel so insecure about my skin anymore. This DNA eye serum is a product that I recommend to everyone because it truly gives you the best results compared to dozens of other brands that I have used. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results and the quality of my skin, I will definitely repurchase this product for many years to come.</li>
    <li> As someone who is in their 30s, I never thought I would have to worry about wrinkles or lines around my eyes. I always thought that would come later. It seemed like it happened so quick.  In the fall, after a summer in the sun, I couldn&#x27;t believe all of the tiny lines I was seeing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the product for a couple weeks, I do notice a bit of a difference. It wasn’t a significant change and it didn’t happen overnight, but with time, I am noticing a positive change in my appearance. I like this product because it contains an ingredient that I haven&#x27;t come across in any other eye product.  Temple Viper Venom, the venom of a viper, which is known to &#x27;paralyze&#x27; the skin.  It also contains Argireline, which is a peptide that works like Botox.  I&#x27;m pretty sure there is no other product on the market that contains both.</li>
    <li> I have used the DNA Serum over a two week period now, applying twice a day, once in the morning and then in the evening.  Per instructions on the tube, I cleanse my face thoroughly with a mild soap, before applying the DNA Serum.  I am a part-time Film and TV actor locally, so my appearance, is my biggest assets, in terms landing gigs, I have used many many products over the past 10 years, and what I have experienced has been pure &amp;#34;Hype and in my mind fallacious advertising just to sell a product&amp;#34;, however my experience with DNA Serum, has been totally different, in that, when I apply the serum, the deep wrinkle lines under my eyes and lines at the corner of my eyes, become almost invisible and remain as such during the entire day.  I had not experienced anything like this with any other product, so because of immense improvement on my deep lines under my eyes, I decided to order the &amp;#34;Delfogo-Rx-Deep Wrinkle Filler Serum and Neck &amp; chest V-Covery Cream&amp;#34; for the following reasons: since none of the Wrinkle and Lifting and Firming Creams had not accomplished an iota in terms of reducing or concealing my Deep Wrinkles on my Forehead, and in my Neck Areas which I have a Droopy Chin and double deep Wrinkle Lines&amp;#34;.  I will do an evaluation on the  &amp;#34;Delfogo-Rx-Deep Wrinkle Filler Serum and Neck &amp; chest V-Covery Cream&amp;#34;, after I have used up both containers in the near future.  as far as my experience with Amazon, they are consistently good on their promised delivery date and I have never had a product damaged or being late.

    <li> DNA Serum - Temple Viper Venom Anti-Wrinkle Eye Serum by Skin Pro has been my favorite anti-wrinkle cream thus far. I have tried a variety of creams and masks since my teenage years, yet have never found a solution to my puffy and wrinkly eyes. During the morning is when the skin around my eyes in most difficult to work with. After using this serum, which is very easy to apply not having to worry about a mud mask mess to clean up, I have realized incredible results; my eyes look a lot younger and definitely more awake in the morning. This product is great because it gets rid of my problem and lasts a lot longer than other wrinkle creams. I think it works well for very skin sensitivities as well because my sister began to use this and her skin is a lot more sensitive than mine, and she said it also gave her the results she wanted.</li>
    <li> When you hit 40 you start worrying about ageing and wrinkles, especially in your face.  I must confess that I have been vain enough (am I?) to try botox, despite the disadvantages such as the discomfort of a needle and a face that can become expressionless.  But desperation is desperation. I was attracted to the DNA serum because it seemed to use a more natural approach. The idea of viper venom freaked me out a bit, but hey botox is still a toxin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that after using this cream for about 3 weeks, I have actually seen a difference.  The skin around my eyes has started filling out, straightening out the wrinkles around my eyes. The skin is also smoother and younger-looking. My face does not feel stiff and expressionless – just supple and smooth. The serum is easy to apply with your fingers by just dabbing around the eyes. This serum is pricey for a lotion, but it is worth it for the palpable results that you get. I only wish I could use it for more than my eyes!</li>
    <li> So here&#x27;s the deal.  I can&#x27;t tell that it&#x27;s any different from the old version. The old version is discontinued, but there are still some left selling for about $35 on Amazon.  Right now, that one at that price should get 5 stars.  This is a bit pricey, and since it only works for the eyes, isn&#x27;t as good as other pricey facial creams like say Skinmedica TNS serum which covers entire face.  Yet I would say this goes a longer ways than you would think.  Once a day, it&#x27;s going to make it 3 months.  Twice a day, probably less than 2 in my opinion.  One squirt is more than enough to cover under both eyes; I think they should limit the pump to produce only 80% of what squirts out now and it would be perfect and a better value as it would go further for the buck. Anyway, this version is supposed to have something that mimics snake venom that paralyzes temporarily the muscles around the sides of the eyes to stop wrinkles, or something like that according to the company website.  Whatever.  I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;m seeing that, but the stuff does work.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it necessarily removes dark circles, but it certainly makes the wrinkles under and the crow&#x27;s feet around your eyes diminish for about half a day.</li>
    <li> As someone who works outside and lives in a very sunny environment I am always worried about my skin becoming prematurely aged. Although I am only in my late 20’s wrinkles and aging are still a concern of mine. There are a lot of people I know who are only slightly older than I am and already have crow’s feet. I’ve taken a few precautions already like trying to limit unnecessary sun exposure, but I’ve recently decided to up my game by investing in some of Skin Pro’s Temple Viper Venom Anti-Wrinkle Eye Serum. It has worked wonders.  I like this stuff a lot since it is really easy to apply. Unlike a lot of serums and creams this one doesn’t require any kind of overly elaborate process. Instead I just dispense one pump from the syringe onto my finger tip. It’s really easy to do and there is no huge mess or boring preparation process.  Only complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t contain sunscreen.</li>
    <li> While I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say I have crow&#x27;s feet just yet, it is definitely a worry of mine (which doesn&#x27;t seem to help the wrinkles any).  When I smile I do notice a few lines around my eyes that have just developed in the last few months.  They didn&#x27;t bother me at first, but now I notice it in pics of myself.  I&#x27;ve tried a number of skin products that are supposed to counteract aging, but none have quite given me the results that DNA Serum has.  I kept at the other ones for months, but with DNA Serum not only was I able to notice results within just one month its more expensive than other products I&#x27;ve used, but I&#x27;m finally paying for something I have confidence in.</li>
    <li> I heard the word venom and I was a little freaked out.  I&#x27;ve never heard of this ingredient before.  I guess the Temple Viper Venom has the same paralyzing on the skin that a snake bite has, so image what it can do for wrinkles...lol... It&#x27;s easy to apply and I usually do it before work and before I go to bed.  The first week or so I noticed a little tightness/tingling sensation after applying, but by week two I didn’t have any tightness/tingling at all.  It&#x27;s not harsh feeling like the name may lead you to believe.  Can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working yet or not.  I&#x27;ve only been using it a week.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I have reordered multiple times and this stuff works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with eye wrinkles for several years now and have started getting chemical peels to help.  They work, but the upkeep is expensive and I was looking for a topical solution to use daily in addition to my peels.  My esthetician recommended this product to me.  I noticed a difference within the first few days in how moisturized my skin felt.  Within a few weeks my wrinkles were softer.  They didn&#x27;t have that harsh, dry look to them and they didn&#x27;t seem to be as deep as they once were.  I didn&#x27;t even have to worry about making another wasted investment in my appearance because they offer a complete satisfaction guarantee.</li>
    <li> I have been using DNA Serum for some time now and am very pleased with the results!  I use it  in conjuction with Elite Eye Serum and have found that the dark circles, bags and wrinkles around my eyes have significantly improved.  ln the past, I have had Boxtox injections to address wrinkles around my eyes and forehead.  DNA Serum has more of an impact that the Botox on the wrinkles and in additon, has greatly improved the dark circles and bags.  I no longer have to have expensive injections every three months.  Thanks to Skin Pro, a leader in anti-aging science and research, I am looking years younger and what a boost to my self-confidence!</li>
    <li> I have been using for several months.  I have also been using another eye product from the same line though, so not sure if it is \\&quot;just\\&quot; the DNA that is special.  I have so many products, trying to downsize and find the \\&quot;one\\&quot;.  So, I used one product on one eye, and this on the other (with the other eye product I said above).  I definitely notice a difference between the two eyes.  This will be a keeper for me...for now :)  Worth trying, but I think the price here is high...go to the site itself or call them.  It will be cheaper.</li>
    <li> Being a 40 year old woman had finally taken it&#x27;s toll on my eyes and my wrinkles and fine lines around my eyes were really getting to me now. I couldn&#x27;t find anything that actually worked for me until one day, this magically appeared in front of my doorstep (my husband ordered it for me) and changed everything! It really made the fine lines and wrinkles disappear and made the skin around my eyes firmer and really gave me a younger look that I really didn&#x27;t think I would ever get from a product. I was really looking into surgery but that idea is way out of the window now that I have this product in my daily regime. I really couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results of this product and I recommend it to anyone who is suffering from wrinkles and fine lines around the eyes and wants their youthful skin back!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few months and am pleased with the results.  Smooths the lines around my eyes.  I use it on the outsides / orbital area - upper cheek bone, side, below and above eyebrow.  Makes my eyes appear younger.  I like to wear eye makeup and am no longer afraid to go for a more dramatic look since my eyes look great.  I get compliments all the time that I don&#x27;t look my age.  I am 55 and recommend the product.  I also use the Elite Serum with it below my eye and on the lid for puffiness and it seems to make a difference.</li>
    <li> I’ve finally reached that age where I have to start worrying about fine lines on my face and finding a product that works well is no easy feat .I&#x27;ve tried all the usual suspects Revlon, Kiehl’s, and Clinique, with little to no success. However, I decided to splurge on the Temple Viper Venom Eye Serum mainly because it contains Argireline.  I&#x27;m familiar with Argireline and the fact that it is supposed to work similarly to Botox, but it also contains Syn-Ake, which I had never heard of before.  Syn-Ake is derived from the venom of a Temple Viper, but in this case its lab formulated.  According to studies, Syn-Ake is supposed to work as well as face freezing injections.  After a few weeks of daily use, I am seeing an improvement to the fine lines and bags around my eyes.  I like to use this serum on my forehead too.  I have two permanent lines that go straight across my forehead and even when I am relaxed they are noticeable.  They have softened and aren&#x27;t as &amp;#34;harsh&amp;#34; looking.  Of course, it’s not a cure to aging and I don’t look like I had a brow lift, but it’s an easy and successful addition to my daily beauty routine.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant when I saw the words DNA Serum and Viper Venom when my friend forwarded the link to this product.  The ingredients sounded super harsh. When I saw her results I knew I had to try this Serum for myself. I have crows feet and laugh lines around my mouth and have been too afraid to use Botox. Drug store and over the counter creams just didn&#x27;t give me the lasting results I needed. After the first week I saw my crows feet were fading and after the second week my laugh lines were softer as well. I use the DNA Serum in the morning before I apply my makeup and at night just before bed. It&#x27;s become a regular part of my beauty regimen. Each week I notice subtle differences. Even my coworkers and family have noticed. I look and feel more vibrant and well rested. I will definitely recommend to friends and family. Great Serum.</li>
    <li> This company is awesome. I&#x27;ve been using both the DNA &amp; Elite Serum daily for over a year now. So glad I found them. Just recently I ordered a product and they shipped a different one (which I also use), no big dal I emailed them and said I&#x27;d keep the one received but would still like to purchase the product from the original order....within an hour they replied back, apologized, and said they would send the order for free! Great products and service! Where the heck do you find that anymore?! :)-- kudos to SkinPro....thank you so much, sincerely, JP</li>
    <li> I like this serum, It help my skin and all over the neck area. It firms and help lift the skin</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!  Liked it from the first day I started using it.  I also use several Delfogo products with this serum so I believe that is enhancing my overall results. I highly recommend giving this a try.  This serum tightens the skin and gives a smoother firmer look under the eyes.  I also use it as a spot treatment on my forehead and the sides of my mouth.  It is one of my new favorite products!i</li>
    <li> So this helps with wrinkles by your eyes. True. It&#x27;s does, but for me it helped with my darkness and puffiness around my eyes. I don&#x27;t really get much sleep so my eyes get dark and puffy. I was looking for something that would at least lighten up the darkness of my eyes. This product helped out with everything. I still barely get any sleep, and I use this everyday. I no longer have darkness or the puffiness under my eyes. It&#x27;s a complete steal for the price, I&#x27;m very satisfied with my results.</li>
    <li> did not notice much of a difference for the price</li>
    <li> I liked the product but the syringe isn&#x27;t working properly.if i twist it several times,i get a bit at a time.very frustrating.</li>
    <li> So I have to admit, when it comes to eliminating wrinkles there really isn’t any sum of money I wouldn’t&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;spend. I have spent shameless amounts of money on expensive department store counter creams,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sephora products and late night infomercial products. Yikes! However, SkinPro’s DNA Serum actually&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;works and does exactly what it promises. This product actually eliminates the appearance of fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The syringe lasts for about 2 months so given that, the price isn’t too bad. I will definitely be ordering&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this product again.</li>
    <li> Even though there are a lot of products on the market that promise to eliminate fine lines and wrinkles, I haven’t found any that work like DNA Serum Temple Viper Venom. The main reason why I like this product so much is the viper venom that literally paralyzes the skin and helps prevent wrinkles and fine lines. Results aren’t going to happen overnight, but they will if you give it enough time. I recommend you give this product a try.  Much more cost efficient than Botox.</li>
    <li> Can’t say I’ve ever taken the time to actually write a review, but I feel obligated. I was that pleased with this product. As I creep closer to 30, years of excessive smiling and partying are really starting to show. Crows feet around my eyes, bags, and laugh lines.  Especially since my face is my paycheck – something had to give. Now, I’m generally not one for sprucing up via creams and what have you, but my buddy told me about this product, and since he vouched for it, I splurged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really pleased.  The dispenser is pretty cool.  I have oily skin so one pump was plenty for both eyes and on the eyes around my mouth.  It didn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy either which was an added bonus.  Just apply it twice a day and your in business.</li>
    <li> I am one of these people that looks very young except if you only look at my eyes. I am a big smiler and live in a sunny climate, so I&#x27;ve worn them out a bit for my young age. I&#x27;ve tried multiple products that promised to correct the bags and lines and have never seen any meaningful results whatsoever. After a friend recommended DNA Serum, I gave it a go. This product is a game changer. Within a week I saw a lightening of the circles; after a month the crows feet are softer. In this world where you never know if you’re buying a good product or a bunch of well-packaged chemicals, it&#x27;s reassuring to find a product that actually does what it says it will do, especially in a sector that often fails to deliver. The DNA Serum works in a way that reflects an evolution of skin treatment that has been a long time coming. I’m totally pleased with this discovery, feel like I truly got what I paid for this time, and hope that others move on from the products that don&#x27;t work and have the same experience I&#x27;ve had with the DNA Serum.</li>
    <li> Excellent serum for tightening the skin under, around the eyes. I have tried many eye creams and found this one of the best. Especially as I do not want to use Botox. It opens up the eyes and gives me a fresh look every day, especially having to wake up very early every day for my work. I use it together with the eye serum. Great product. It is worth the money.</li>
    <li> Whenever I saw ads about anti-wrinkle creams, I always believed the wrinkles and fine lines were digitally erased from  the model&#x27;s face to make her look youthful.  Puffy eyes and wrinkles were my malady and I made a beeline for many home remedies and natural ingredients to make it go away. They didn&#x27;t work, but I was satisfied that I made an effort to try them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I came upon the Temple Viper venom, anti-wrinkle eye serum and read the ingredients. I researched about it. The more I researched; the more I understood its focus. I purchased one and started applying the serum as directed. This totally changed my outlook because now I looked like the model with the changes. The fine lines smoothened; the puffiness retracted and added freshness to my face. There is a natural glow on my complexion that beams of self-confidence and happiness. It is a product that should be tried otherwise you won&#x27;t believe in it. I suggest you take a photo of yourself before and after using the product to convince yourself that it is really you, looking gorgeous all over again. I know I did.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I am seeing results after 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> This product feels instantly firming . As soon as I applied it I could feel a slight taughtness in my skin. To be honest I was a little disappointed that this effect wasn&#x27;t long lasting but be patient! After just over a week of use as directed I have noticed that some of the finer lines around my eyes are becoming less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is very easy to apply and it seems to moisturize very well so you don&#x27;t necessarily need an eye cream on top of it. The skin around my eyes feels wonderfully soft and looks clear and bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product and the price is great too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple weeks now, and I&#x27;m proud to say that it works! Ever since I started to notice the signs of aging a few years ago, I have been trying to combat it with the wide array of creams offered and even some of the injection methods, but nothing has had as much of a reversing affect as this serum has! I was a bit wary of putting something called &amp;#34;temple viper venom&amp;#34; so close to my eyes, but I&#x27;m glad I did- it was worth it for the confidence I&#x27;ve gained back from my newly rejuvenated skin- I haven&#x27;t felt so good about my skin since college!​  I didn&#x27;t realize how bad I had started to feel about my appearance until I started feeling so good again.  That was a horrible feeling.  There&#x27;s nothing worse than looking in the mirror and feeling bad about yourself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a person who was always aware of her age and youth/beauty. Since I was a younger girl I was always applying mud masks and lotions to keep my skin supple and smooth. I&#x27;ve tried wrinkle &amp;#34;serums/wonders&amp;#34;, some of which where REALLY expensive, and I saw little results. I used this DNA serum and notice a definite change after first application. Over the next week I continued to use it and see, not &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; results but defiantly REAL results. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and I hope to have the same results when I buy my next one.</li>
    <li> I had been dealing with crow’s feet around my eyes for a few years now. With my 50th birthday around the corner I got a bit worried that the lines would get worse. I searched around and found DNA Serum. I was a bit skeptical at first. I mean, snake venom? But I decided to give it a try anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I was blown away by the results. It only took a dab around each eye to do the trick. The wrinkles were smoothed out. They didn’t completely disappear but it did give me the best results of any product I’ve ever tried. I think it might be the snake venom that is the magic ingredient. The only downside is that for the price I wanted the cream to work on other areas of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its pricey for just an eye cream, but again, it’s the results that really count. My family has noticed the difference, so I’m not complaining. I will visit the company website to see what other products they offer. If this one product works this well I’d love to see what else they offer.</li>
    <li> I’m not usually one to take the time to write online reviews because I always figure someone elsewill, but this product is way too awesome not to rave about. After my first week using Temple Viper Venom anti-wrinkle serum, the wrinkles and crow’s feet around my eyes looked better. It has clinical strength ingredients such as peptides, Pentapharm, Lipotec, Centerchem and DSM which have never been offered by medical professionals before this serum. It’s seriously effective and a great wrinkle reducer because they use the science of DNA rejuvenation, so it  works against the natural signs of aging. I think if all middle aged women used this when they started to see wrinkles, we’d all look a lot younger than we are! And who doesn’t want that?!</li>
    <li> The Anti-Wrinkle Eye Serum made my sister happier. My older sister has been feeling like she isn&#x27;t pretty anymore. She&#x27;s actually been rather disappointed with her physical features lately and I hate it. I bought her this product around New Year&#x27;s but she hadn&#x27;t used it. Recently, she&#x27;s been applying it for a wedding she&#x27;s attending in March. I must admit, it&#x27;s definitely a confidence booster for her. She&#x27;s so much happier. I personally don&#x27;t really notice a difference. In fact, I didn&#x27;t even realize there was a problem with her face in the first place, but she&#x27;s so much more content and satisfied with her looks that I&#x27;m really glad I got it. Her laughter is definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to give this product 4 stars but the shipping is extremely fast. Same day shipping. Not to mention the option for gift wrapping. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this for myself. But it can be a worthwhile gift.</li>
    <li> I liked this product because it was affordable all the while giving me the results I wanted. Most products I’ve put money into were considerably more expensive and didn’t yield the smoothing of my wrinkles like I anticipated. This product worked quicker than I expected as well, about a month and a half after buying it I started noticing results. I don’t have to use as much makeup anymore, which makes this a double bonus for me-less money on all kinds of products.</li>
    <li> Have not formed much of an opinion as yet.  I have been using the product since I purchased it, morning and night. I have not seen any difference at all on my crow&#x27;s feet.  I thought I would also try this product on my laugh lines and lip lines. No changes there either.  Should I see any improvement in either of these areas, I will re-review. As of right now, all it does is moisturize my eyes.</li>
    <li> So this helps with wrinkles by your eyes. True. It&#x27;s does, but for me it helped with my darkness and puffiness around my eyes. I don&#x27;t really get much sleep so my eyes get dark and puffy. I was looking for something that would at least lighten up the darkness of my eyes. This product helped out with everything. I still barely get any sleep, and I use this everyday. I no longer have darkness or the puffiness under my eyes. It&#x27;s a complete steal for the price, I&#x27;m very satisfied with my results.</li>
    <li> I’m a skincare junky but I’m also way too scared to try anything that involves a needle.  I’m always on the lookout for new topical products that might make a difference yet still look natural.  I’d done a little bit of reading about Syn-ake here and there, but I assumed it would work like some of the ‘blur’ products currently available – and they never worked for me.  Every one that I tried caused my makeup to ball up under my eyes and turn everything into a horrible mess.  Basically, instead of softening the look of my smile lines, the balled up mess brought all the attention directly to the eye area.  Very disappointing.  Anyhow, I decided I didn’t have much to lose, so I purchased the Temple Viper serum.  Wow, all I can say is I’m glad I took a chance to try this stuff out.  It’s only been a few weeks and I’ve already noticed that my eye area is looking more refreshed and relaxed.  And with this product, a little goes a long way.  I can’t wait to see how great I look in another few weeks!</li>
    <li> Wrinkles and bags around my eyes has always been my problem area when it comes to showing my age. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products over the years and was spending a lot of time and money for no apparent reason. It was like gambling when you roll the dice over and over but there&#x27;s never a payoff. It seems like I tried everything from drugstore brands to various super expensive online products. Not a single product ever worked to give my eyes a younger appearance. Some products felt good in terms of moisture but the appearance didn&#x27;t improve. As an aging baby boomer, I&#x27;m not ready to act OR look my age. I just can&#x27;t afford to experiment and gamble my money any more and I&#x27;m tired of being disappointed. But the good thing is, one of my friends can still afford to experiment and she found the DNA Serum. I liked what I saw it had done for her so now I&#x27;m using it and it&#x27;s working around my eyes!  It&#x27;s hard to describe, but when I glance in a mirror I see that it&#x27;s the \\&quot;me\\&quot; I think I look like (not some old lady). My eyes look good and that makes me look younger -- the way I&#x27;m supposed to look! I hope that makes sense.  My eyes look softer and smoother. Not that you&#x27;d mistake me for a thirty-something but I look far from old lady. I&#x27;d say now I&#x27;ve got that \\&quot;ageless\\&quot; look that some women have. Which is exactly the improvement I&#x27;ve been looking for. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Great product - my mother recommended it a while back, and since using it, I look way less tired, and my crows feet seem to have visibly minimized a fair amount. The plumpness of my face from years ago appears to gradually be coming back, at least more than I’ve ever noticed in the past. The texture applies well to my skin and it absorbs easily. Only con would be that my skin feels a little tight after applying the product but I suppose this is natural for any rejuvenating eye product. I wish that there were a little more in the bottle as well. Generally, the product delivers more than other brands out of my budget that promise similar youthful results but don’t tackle the multiple aging factors as well.</li>
    <li> After recently purchasing Elite Serum from SkinPro and having great results, I decided to try another one of their products (DNA Serum)that is a little more geared toward eye wrinkles.  I have been experiencing crow&#x27;s feet and wrinkles underneath my eye&#x27;s so I thought I would purchase another SkinPro product.  I absolutely love this one!  I apply it underneath and on the creases of my eyes once in the morning and once prior to sleep.  I have had the product for a week so far and I&#x27;m noticing less lines and also a much smoother feel and look.  SkinPro is an amazing company from my experience so far and the DNA Serum is available at a price I could not refuse.  I highly reccommend SkinPro products and this DNA Serum for anyone wanting to see results at a great price!</li>
