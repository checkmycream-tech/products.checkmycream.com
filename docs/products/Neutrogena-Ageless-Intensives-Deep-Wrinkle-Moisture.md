      <li>I have very fair and sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I just love the way it feels when I put it on.  </li>
      <li>I love this Serum.</li>
      <li>I love Neutrogena Products , did not get rid of wrinkles as advertised</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s stronger, and there is no residue; my face, neck, and decolletage, have never looked better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not so sure about.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still satisfied.</li>
      <li>There could and should be a better way.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, I guess.</li>
      <li>love this too.</li>
      <li>love this item came on a timely bases.</li>
      <li>after about 4 months of use, he looks noticeably more youthful and his skin on his face is brighter and has a smoother texture.</li>
      <li>Have used this great product for years now order on line, really convenient</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;m not using this under my eyes as most others are.</li>
      <li>I can see a significant improvement on my skin and this does what it excatly say!</li>
      <li>I am happy with the results thus far, and I have been using this product for over 1 1/2 yrs.</li>
      <li>Plus it&#x27;s a good moisturizer which is quickly absorbed and leaves no unpleasant residue.</li>
      <li>What I like about this is that it doesnt leave your skin oily and absorves very quickly.</li>
      <li>It has a light and refreshing smell and goes on smooth without being greasy.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I apply this to my forehead, my crows-feet and the fine lines around my mouth area</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m telling you, this serum keeps those fine lines and wrinkles at bay.  </li>
      <li>I bought it because it was recommended by Consumer Reports, and after about 6 weeks, I feel that it has helped diminish some fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>My absolute favorite moisturizer!</li>
      <li>In the morning, my skin felt silky smooth like a baby&#x27;s face.  </li>
      <li>My husband has been using this for several months and his skin has improved greatly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a Licensed Cosmetologist and have used many different Brands of cosmetics, this is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a smooth, non greasy, no scent serum, try this one if you can find it.</li>
      <li>Let me start by saying I don&#x27;t love this product, but I LIKE it very much.  </li>
      <li>so I was excited to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>This is the most effective product I have ever bought, especially considering its affordability.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years and find it&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t cause problems with my contact lenses and feels good going on.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned with red hair &amp; 69 yrs.</li>
      <li>Maybe it wasn&#x27;t completely full.</li>
      <li>I used one full bottle of this product by applying it nightly before bedtime.  </li>
      <li>This product may be discontinued but I&#x27;ve been lucky getting through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>My skin looks fresh and bright and I have received multiple compliments at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I like this much better than meaningful beauty or Clinique because it works better and does cost less and that is a plus.</li>
      <li>This product works well with respect to helping reduce facial wrinkles----I liked this very much!</li>
      <li>This stuff is powerful.</li>
      <li>Certainly worth the price.</li>
      <li>But, be sure your moisturizer has SPF as this does make your skin sensitive to the sun.  </li>
      <li>I have been using ROC for some time, which I love (and still use their eye cream) but even the sensitive formulas irritate my skin.  </li>
      <li>Ok, so I use this product around my lip area morning and night then apply either Neutrogena Visibly Even before my light makeup,  or if it is night time, I use one of several Neutrogena night creams.</li>
      <li>Delivery was rapid and price was right.</li>
      <li>and I certainly found it to be that!</li>
      <li>A bit dismayed, I decided to continue as directed and after a few more days a new layer of smooth wrinkle free skin materialized!</li>
      <li>I have a handful of tried and true favorites, and rarely does a new product break into the fold.</li>
      <li>Above all, it is very cheap.</li>
      <li>After the first application you can see the results.</li>
      <li>Then, layer on one more product the same way: Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Moisturizer with 30 SPF.</li>
      <li>With continued and consistent use, the product does make a difference in skin appearance.</li>
      <li>It states to only use ONE DROP on face, I used a lot more than that</li>
      <li>On top of breaking out, the pump quit working, so I had to open the cap to get the serum out.</li>
      <li>Overall, the Neutrogena product seemed to give a better effect.</li>
      <li>Hopefully it may prevent more wrinkles since it certainly does not erase current ones.</li>
      <li>I love this serum -- I have used it for at least three years, maybe more.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is basic no-bull serum with a reasonable amount of true retinol, as opposed to the lesser effective retinyl palmitate.</li>
      <li>It just gets better from there, I&#x27;ll be using it for as long as Neutrogena continues to make it.  </li>
      <li>I wish i could say I&#x27;ve seen great results using it; however, hard to tell as I&#x27;m getting older</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> What I like about this is that it doesnt leave your skin oily and absorves very quickly. Also the price is very good</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself but ended up giving it to my husband. He is about 38 years old and had some major bags under his eyes. after about 4 months of use, he looks noticeably more youthful and his skin on his face is brighter and has a smoother texture. I just bought another one online so that i can start using it myself. two thumbs up! Affordable, not as harsh as the other retin-a products ive used and actually WORKS.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all and this stuff made the skin under and around my eyes burn and peel.  I was beyond disappointed.  I was mortified and looked like a maniac with red, peeling, irritated skin for about a week.  I do not recommend this product for wrinkles around the eyes.</li>
    <li> I am 26 and am recovering from tremendously awful cystic acne. I bought this product for a wrinkle in between my eyebrows that has formed from an atrophic (indented) scar due to collagen damage from repeated cysts popping up in the same exact place over and over. Because of my age, I want to make that wrinkle go away, because it makes me look older. I have been using this product for about a week and will update as time goes on. I wanted to write a review of the initial experience so others hopefully will not stop using the product if they don&#x27;t see results quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very oily, combination skin prone to severe hormonal acne breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week of use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-No tingling or burning as others have reported. However, I&#x27;m not using this under my eyes as most others are. I&#x27;m only using it between my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;-Moisturizes very well, and as long as you don&#x27;t gob it on, it dries smoothly and is not sticky as some other people reported&lt;br /&gt;-It says it&#x27;s non comedogenic, but I did break out with a couple small pimples around the outer edges of where the product dried. However, this might be unrelated, as I break out frequently anyway.&lt;br /&gt;-Skin started peeling off the wrinkle after 6 days of use. On the box, it says this is a sign it&#x27;s working (as the old, damaged skin sheds, newer skin should appear to improve wrinkle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely hopeful after the skin started to peel off. I&#x27;ll update in awhile to mention if the skin has improved.</li>
    <li> very good product.. probably the best that I have found.. will order again....I am 66 so any improvement is appreciated.. and applauded...</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product, and I encourage women to try it.  I started using it on the basis of a review by Consumer Reports.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any thing great about this over other facial creams and it was expensive</li>
    <li> I love this product! Received as described. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Hi, I am a 33 year old female.  I used one full bottle of this product by applying it nightly before bedtime.  It has a light and refreshing smell and goes on smooth without being greasy.  In the morning, my skin felt silky smooth like a baby&#x27;s face.  It did nothing for the wrinkles around my eyes.  I am now trying RoC anti wrinkle night cream and it also does nothing for wrinkles.  Overall, the Neutrogena product seemed to give a better effect. Hopefully it may prevent more wrinkles since it certainly does not erase current ones.</li>
    <li> Noticeable results within 2 weeks.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I keep getting surprised at how soft my skin feels using this! I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s lessened the looks of my wrinkles, but it&#x27;s definitely making my skin feel soft and supple, so I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
    <li> After the first application you can see the results. I use it at nights, and in the morning my face looks radiant and healthy, and without causing dryness as other retinol products. I will continue with this treatment for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Major rip off! I am 20 years old and I&#x27;ve been using this product for weeks. It&#x27;s a total scam, these reviewers saying it works are full of it. Do not waste your money because it does nothing but lie.. No results, no amazing Ingrediants. Your better off rubbing avacados on your face!</li>
    <li> The package told me this was an \\&quot;intensive treatment\\&quot; and I certainly found it to be that! I used it each night for a week and experienced some mild burning and redness. After two days the exfoliation began, particularly under my eyes, and I woke up each morning looking a bit rough; as if recovering from sunburn. It also exposed seemingly new wrinkles under my eyes. A bit dismayed, I decided to continue as directed and after a few more days a new layer of smooth wrinkle free skin materialized! It really took years off my appearance, and I have been complimented by several people in that regard. I have now set aside this product and switched to Neutrogena&#x27;s Deep Wrinkle Night Moisturizer for daily maintenance. This Serum is a bit too intense for prolonged use in my case, but for periodic correction I would definitely and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this product! One of the best anti wrinkle products that I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> Smells delicious and makes my skin feel soft and smooth!  I still have all of my wrinkles, but there is no product that is going to get rid of wrinkles.  You just want to find a good product that makes your skin feel good.</li>
    <li> No improvement whatsoever, I&#x27;m going back to Roc</li>
    <li> I am 65 yrs. old. I should have started using these products sooner. I am happy with the results thus far, and I have been using this product for over 1 1/2 yrs.</li>
    <li> I am pretty skeptical about skincare products in general, and anti-wrinkle products in particular. I have a handful of tried and true favorites, and rarely does a new product break into the fold. A friend recommended this Neutrogena retinol serum to me, and I was hesitant to try it because of my memories of Retin-A from high school (15 years ago). Retin-A always seemed too harsh, and I didn&#x27;t like the after-effects of dry, flaking skin and redness. However, out of curiosity, I decided to give this product a try... and I am so glad I did! I use it at night, 3-4 times per week. (It is a little too harsh for everyday use, in my opinion.) I&#x27;ve gone through 3 bottles in the past year. My skin is noticably smoother and my smile-lines are less-defined. The Amazon price is a solid discount compared to regular retail. I am a very happy customer!</li>
    <li> Does a good job of giving me smoother skin-feels non greasy on my face.  Will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used more expensive products, but I think this one performs just as well.  I bought it because it was recommended by Consumer Reports, and after about 6 weeks, I feel that it has helped diminish some fine lines and wrinkles.  Certainly worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love this serum -- I have used it for at least three years, maybe more.  I try new products such as cleansers, moisturizers, make-up, etc. all the time but this product is my mainstay. I apply this to my forehead, my crows-feet and the fine lines around my mouth area and I&#x27;m telling you, this serum keeps those fine lines and wrinkles at bay.  You have to use the product -- if you don&#x27;t use it every day (I put it on at night), it&#x27;s not going to work as well.  I get compliments on my young looking skin and I contribute it all to this product!  If they ever discontinue it, I will be highly upset! I don&#x27;t do Botox or any other type of cosmetic surgery - why should I?  This is my miracle cream!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years and have been happy with it.</li>
    <li> very good /use in a.m. with gel moisturizer.I am skeptical because of my profession but this is a great procuct.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget to exfoliate dead skin cells. Once a weak for sensitive skin 2x for less sensitive &amp; dry skin.</li>
    <li> With continued and consistent use, the product does make a difference in skin appearance. Plus it&#x27;s a good moisturizer which is quickly absorbed and leaves no unpleasant residue.</li>
    <li> love this too. I use it along with the intensive day moisturizer with sun screen and the intensive night moisturizer ( very good). This helps with dark spots and discoloring. It goes on really smooth and it takes so little. When it gets empty I use a q-tip to get every drop. Amazon.com has the best prices. This helps with dry skin also. using all three products together works best. I like this much better than meaningful beauty or Clinique because it works better and does cost less and that is a plus.</li>
    <li> I have been using ROC for some time, which I love (and still use their eye cream) but even the sensitive formulas irritate my skin.  I have very fair and sensitive skin so it&#x27;s a hard choice to make between getting wrinkles or having blotchy, irritated skin from strong Retinol creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this product since it has Retinol but is a serum rather than a cream.  I love it!  I am 35 so don&#x27;t have any deep wrinkles at this point but there are a few tiny ones starting on my forehead and along the side of my mouth (smile lines).  I have noticed improvement in these AND in the overall look of my skin.  My skin looks fresh and bright and I have received multiple compliments at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also been using this on my neck and chest and both are looking firmer and younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone who wants the benefits of retinol without the awful irritation it can bring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I should note that there was slight peeling on my face the first few weeks of using this.  Putting on moisturizer helped and I don&#x27;t&#x27; think it was noticeable to anyone but me**</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite moisturizer! Great deal, will buy again!!</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this for several months and his skin has improved greatly. Wonderful product and great price</li>
    <li> This product works well with respect to helping reduce facial wrinkles----I liked this very much! Easy to use.  Delivery was rapid and price was right.</li>
    <li> This did not help with the deep wrinkle on my forehead and believe it or not gave me a lot more forehead wrinkles which before I used had one small one! See pictures.  They have not gone away and now I am using cocoa butter for stretch marks on my face.</li>
    <li> This smells a lot like maple syrup. It takes forever to rub in, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it actually gets absorbed. Haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in my wrinkles, but maybe it&#x27;s doing something?</li>
    <li> For goodness sakes...use as directed. I did not read the directions on how to use this and placed a thin layer over my chin area...BIG mistake. This stuff is powerful. I felt the tingling and thought great! Its working, HOWEVER...the next morning when I washed my face, the skin on the chin area where I put this stuff came off and I had a bad raw area, it scaled over later that morning (yes, it scaled) , and found a brand new wrinkle in the worst spot of treated area. PLEASE read the instructions!! I wish I had. It states to only use ONE DROP on face, I used a lot more than that and it was my mistake.&lt;br /&gt;My face has healed, wrinkle has vanished, and I am using it again but like I am supposed to... ONE DROP in the area I am treating...not a drop more!! This is good stuff. Just use it like you are supposed to.</li>
    <li> The only serum that I&#x27;ve tried so far with retinol that doesn&#x27;t break me out. And I&#x27;ve used ROC products, which I wanted to love so badly but just really messed up my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum smooths out my skin and stops me from breaking out, now wrinkles I&#x27;m not so sure about. I can&#x27;t tell a difference in my few lines but the benefits it does for my skin far outweighs it&#x27;s lackluster wrinkle potency.</li>
    <li> Like neutrogena products</li>
    <li> This is the most effective product I have ever bought, especially considering its affordability. This stuff is basic no-bull serum with a reasonable amount of true retinol, as opposed to the lesser effective retinyl palmitate. You should wear sunscreen moisturizer during the day and use this only before bed. This serum is in an opaque, thick bottle, which is important as Retinol is said to degrade in packaging that doesn&#x27;t keep air or light out.</li>
    <li> I like this serum! My skin absorb it very well. Above all, it is very cheap. Would recommend it to friends!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to geet more!</li>
    <li> This product may be discontinued but I&#x27;ve been lucky getting through Amazon.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and find it&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t cause problems with my contact lenses and feels good going on.  I wish i could say I&#x27;ve seen great results using it; however, hard to tell as I&#x27;m getting older the lines are there.  If you&#x27;re looking for a smooth, non greasy, no scent serum, try this one if you can find it.</li>
    <li> so used a different amount of serum&#x27;s in the past but this is the one I always come back to. Love this and the other Neutrogena products</li>
    <li> Made my skin oily by mid-day.</li>
    <li> I have used this product since I was in my 40&#x27;s. Now in my late 60&#x27;s I&#x27;m still satisfied. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles on my face, but I do on the rest of me. Apparently, something is different on my face. I wish I could afford to use this all over me.</li>
    <li> a noticable improvement in only 4 weeks of use</li>
    <li> This is great for my skin.Been using it for several years.  Have had a  hard time finding it in the stores so I was excited to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I tried this product &amp; was having good results but 2 days ago I noticed my skin was shedding / peeling  around the temple areas &amp; today on one of my cheeks.  I&#x27;m going to have to stop using it which is a shame because it did work until all this happened.  I&#x27;m fair skinned with red hair &amp; 69 yrs. old.</li>
    <li> I suppose it&#x27;s a good product.  Haven&#x27;t seen any change.  Guess I&#x27;m too old or expecting too much to make old go away.</li>
    <li> just started using... stand by for an updated review</li>
    <li> Received it promptly and it is was a great price.</li>
    <li> love this item came on a timely bases.</li>
    <li> I have seen decent results using this product.  It smells vaguely of maple syrup and it goes on silky smooth.  My only complaint about it is that it can make my skin kind of greasy if I am going to put makeup on over it, so I only use it at night.</li>
    <li> This is a good winter moisturizer, but doesn&#x27;t seem to help with wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Noticeable difference after only one week! The lines under my eyes have already begun smoothing out! It burns like the dickens but for the improvement, I can bear it. Great product especially for the price!34 yr old African American woman</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I can see a significant improvement on my skin and this does what it excatly say! Will be purchase more from this product again!!! great to use under your night moisturiser!...</li>
    <li> I like this product and feel it is a good anti-wrinkle product to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main objection is the bottle it comes in.  It is too small and the pump is useless when the product is getting low.  You have to remove the pump lid and shake it out.  There could and should be a better way.</li>
    <li> I am now a senior citizen, boo hoo, NOT, love being this age. Ok, so I use this product around my lip area morning and night then apply either Neutrogena Visibly Even before my light makeup,  or if it is night time, I use one of several Neutrogena night creams. Even though I&#x27;ve never smoked I&#x27;m still getting lines around my mouth area, this serum helps considerably. But my REAL secret beauty tip use for this product: Put a generous drop on the back of one hand. With the other hand flipped over rub this product into both hand backs, don&#x27;t use a finger to rub in, by doing this technique then all the product stays on the back of your hands. Then, layer on one more product the same way: Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Moisturizer with 30 SPF. Wow, not only do I not have any brown spots on my hands but for most of the day there are few wrinkles. I&#x27;ve being doing this combo for years.</li>
    <li> This is still my favorite serum after trying at least l0 others.  I use it under my moisturizer. But, be sure your moisturizer has SPF as this does make your skin sensitive to the sun.  I just love the way it feels when I put it on.  And, it never irritates my skin, never has and I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
    <li> I checked online about its date of manufacture，and it shows about &amp;#34;2011&amp;#34;, But i bought it in the end of  2013.....So it may over the using time or as least not so fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x60;m not very happy with this.</li>
    <li> I love this Serum. That&#x27;s not the point of the 3 stars. I use this serum for a long time and I will keep on using. As all products from Neutrogena. But usually this serum would last 2 months for me. This time it only lasted 1 month. So I don&#x27;t know what happened. Maybe it wasn&#x27;t completely full. So I guess it could have been a bad luck this time.</li>
    <li> Comparing this with a tretinoin based topical, I believe I would have been better served by using tretinoin based serum, with tretinoin being somewhat more active than retinol as the active ingredient. Tretinoin is an organic compound structurally relatd to retinol.</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogena Products , did not get rid of wrinkles as advertised but that is not the companies fault.</li>
    <li> I have extensive experience with retinol serums. After using Neutrogena Retinol Serums in the past, I thought this serum would be stronger, or at least comparable.  I anticipated loving it, but I was really disappointed.  The first thing I noticed was the sticky residue that it left on my face and neck.  Since I only use 1 pump, which yields an amount the size of a small pea, it certainly wasn&#x27;t because I used too much.  I have extremely sensitive skin, which is why I prefer a serum.  But, this formulation made me break out.  It&#x27;s no stronger than Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair retinol serum or Roc Retinol.  On top of breaking out, the pump quit working, so I had to open the cap to get the serum out. If you&#x27;re looking for something stronger, that really works, but won&#x27;t break the bank, try Prodermis Retinol Serum ( http://www.amazon.com/Retinol-Serum-Guarantee-Noticeable-Difference/dp/B00EUST6V2/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1412480924&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;prodermis+retinol+serum ). The cost of the Prodermis is 1/2 of Neutrogena (you get 1.75 ounces), it&#x27;s stronger, and there is no residue; my face, neck, and decolletage, have never looked better.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product but unfortunately is did not work well for me.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if this thing works or not.  I still looked the same. Placebo effect?</li>
    <li> I am in my mid-30&#x27;s and have been using Neutrogena \\&quot;Ageless Intensives Deep Wrinkle Serum\\&quot; for a few weeks.  I am completely disappointed with the product because of several reasons.  I didn&#x27;t have the sensitivity issues experienced by other consumers; however, it does have a very unpleasant smell!  I did not see any improvements to my skin--it actually felt worse.  The product should have a WARNING stating \\&quot;do not apply under eyes\\&quot;.  The product claims to address crows feet (which are around the eyes), but DON&#x27;T BUY IT!  It made the skin under my eyes dry and flaky and even seems that it made my winkles worse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Licensed Cosmetologist and have used many different Brands of cosmetics, this is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s instant, as far as moisturizing, you feel and see the difference immediately. It just gets better from there, I&#x27;ll be using it for as long as Neutrogena continues to make it.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 1 month and I can clearly see a big difference, my glow is back!</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I don&#x27;t love this product, but I LIKE it very much.  I use it ONLY on my brow lines as I am 37 years old and they have become more pronounced. In any case, the second ingredient listed on this product is silicone (anything ending with &#x27;ane&#x27; or &#x27;one&#x27; is a silicone). With that said, the silicone acts as a temporary filler for my lines between the brows.  I went to see a Dermotologist who gave me a prescription for Atralin.  It&#x27;s a gel that helps acne as well as wrinkles (just like Retin-A).  It really didn&#x27;t do anything for my wrinkles, so if it&#x27;s a temporary fix for me (i.e. - silicone) then I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
    <li> This stuff works!  I have deep wrinkles above my lip, under my nose, &amp; when I use this they practically disappear.  It was well packed too.</li>
    <li> Not too expensive and works great.  It always lasts a while which I can&#x27;t say for many other serums I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as other woman rated it.  This product has a great product for the money and does what it says it does.  For many years I used a very expensive line of products that never really worked.  Since they were so expensive I thought they had to work but they didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Noticeable but subtitle difference. Does make eyes water if it too close to the eyes. Burning sensation is normal as it said so on the bottle. This went away after 1 week.  Already brought the next bottle.  I am a male in his 40&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I have seen an improvement on my skin. Pores are smaller, and that annoying wrinkle on my forehead has diminished greatly. Happily surprised that Neutrogena can do better that my more expensive creams!  I am not going back to my former $150 jar!!!!</li>
    <li> Have used this great product for years now order on line, really convenient</li>
    <li> I love this product, but there&#x27;s not very much in the bottle and you can get all of it out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I am 64 yrs old w/extensive sun damage. I grew up at the beach in So Cal.  This product feels so soft on my face. Have been using it faithfully. I do see a change in the prominence of my deepest wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Best product I have used in 60 years. It does diminish wrinkles.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, I guess. Have not noticed much difference from using the Rapid Wrinkle Repair / Night and think I will stick with that.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t too thrill with this cream. Smelled horrible, made me sick . Won&#x27;t buy it again!</li>
    <li> It give my face a nice appearance and you don&#x27;t have to wear make up.  It gives your face a break from wearing make-up.</li>
