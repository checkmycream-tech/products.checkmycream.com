      <li>,MYCARD IS SAFE ,THANK YOU AMAZON</li>
      <li>Essential Depot has wonderful products.</li>
      <li>I purchased this olive oil for soap making and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
      <li>I bought to combine with antibacterial dish soap to effectively and gently clean my makeup brushes.</li>
      <li>The Olive Oil seems to be of good quality, and with the price, it certainly has the value.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had to move up to much larger sizes of pumice olive oil, but this is a nice size at a good price.</li>
      <li>It smells like you&#x27;d expect, like pure olive oil, and it makes a wonderful, hard bar of soap with a great lather.</li>
      <li>The package arrives quickly and every oil is well protected inside the box.</li>
      <li>But if you don&#x27;t know much about oils and you want a quality product that is shipped fast in a nice trial size before you go buy bulk, then this is it.</li>
      <li>I started making my own soap after realizing how much filler and undesirable ingredients were in most commercial soaps.  </li>
      <li>Love this oil for soap making and it&#x27;s a pretty decent price for what it is.</li>
      <li>WE LIKED THIS AND USING ON MY HAIR ,GIVE LUSTRE AND SOOTHES SCALP,AMAZON IS A VERY TRUSTED SITE ,I HAVE BEEN FACING SOME VIRUS PROBLEM IN MY COMPUTER ,FOR THE LAST 3 DAYS</li>
      <li>Its easy to pour and the spout is nearly drip-free.</li>
      <li>When making soap, I need to be able to have the same outcome for every batch.</li>
      <li>Most of the pints we weighed from Essential Depot came in between 900-1050 grams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You can get slightly better deals on the main website but only if you order 1-2 gallons at a time.</li>
      <li>Used for soap making, blended well with other ingrediants...would recommend as an easy beginner oil!  </li>
      <li>it came fast, i use  it for soap making</li>
      <li>there is soo much i use it to tak baths</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>It has different properties in soap making you should become familiar with before you use it in soap making.</li>
      <li>Essential Depot offers the best olive pomace oil available for cold process soap.</li>
      <li>Not sure if the value is great or not but due to prime membership, I was able to get this quickly because I&#x27;m impatient and when I have an idea, I want to do it now.  </li>
      <li>I have since tried regular extra virgin olive oil and although it does a good job too, I can definitely tell the difference.</li>
      <li>I use this and other oils on my hair and nails even though I can get this oil anywhere its easy to buy them on amazon</li>
      <li>The prices here are consistent with the main website, especially when you factor in shipping if you have prime.</li>
      <li>No strange odors and was shipped fast.</li>
      <li>The only problem I had with it is that it went too fast.</li>
      <li>I am new at making soap and am glad I tried this first, It helps make the soap trace faster, cutting down the time on cooking (hot process soap).</li>
      <li>Essential Depot makes high quality oils at low cost.  </li>

    <li> If you&#x27;re into making soaps, Pomace grade olive oil is the way to go. I am new at making soap and am glad I tried this first, It helps make the soap trace faster, cutting down the time on cooking (hot process soap). I have since tried regular extra virgin olive oil and although it does a good job too, I can definitely tell the difference. The only problem I had with it is that it went too fast. I&#x27;ll have to re-order. I recommend.</li>
    <li> Essential depot is my go to seller for soap making oils or anything related. The package arrives quickly and every oil is well protected inside the box. The package is insured so no need to worry about being lost. I only wish they sold gallons</li>
    <li> Made soap.  Worked good.</li>
    <li> I started making cold-process soap from home back in November.  Essential Depot makes high quality oils at low cost.  Very happy with the purchase.</li>

    <li> Purchased this to use for my homemade cold process soaps.  Quality is good.  Not sure if the value is great or not but due to prime membership, I was able to get this quickly because I&#x27;m impatient and when I have an idea, I want to do it now.  No strange odors and was shipped fast.</li>

    <li> Great oil for soap making.</li>
    <li> The oil worked well in my soap!</li>
    <li> Seemed to be much thinner than your average Olive Oil which made me question is this 100% Olive Oil also the bottle was leaking badly when shipped so this wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> good produce good company</li>
    <li> Good product. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, it serves the purpose for which I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had to move up to much larger sizes of pumice olive oil, but this is a nice size at a good price. I use this in my handmade soaps.</li>
    <li> I started making my own soap after realizing how much filler and undesirable ingredients were in most commercial soaps.  This stuff works wonderfully for making castile soap.</li>
    <li> Good product good price</li>
    <li> Used for soap and love it, will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this product for soapmaking. Its easy to pour and the spout is nearly drip-free. price was great also!</li>
    <li> Used in soap, worked great...</li>
    <li> Used this for holiday soap making; worked well.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I use it for my face/body, and it works. Giant bottle. I don&#x27;t know when I will use it all up. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Essential Depot has wonderful products. When making soap, I need to be able to have the same outcome for every batch. I can achieve this and a quality product by using their ingredients.</li>
    <li> Worked great, good quality</li>
    <li> Perfect for soap making. I had no issues with this product, except maybe for the price. I figured I should go with Oil made for soap making purposes rather than just using regular cooking oil. Not sure if it made a difference, but my father loved his soap, so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Perfect for makin sugar scrubs!</li>
    <li> works nice for my cold-process soaps</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes my soap incredible!</li>
    <li> The price is a little high buying from Amazon. But if you don&#x27;t know much about oils and you want a quality product that is shipped fast in a nice trial size before you go buy bulk, then this is it. It weighs about 1000 grams with the bottle. Most of the pints we weighed from Essential Depot came in between 900-1050 grams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t the same stuff you cook with. It has different properties in soap making you should become familiar with before you use it in soap making.</li>
    <li> Great product, smells like olive oil, but don&#x27;t eat it! It&#x27;s only for external use. A little on your cuticles makes a big difference.</li>
    <li> Love this oil for soap making and it&#x27;s a pretty decent price for what it is. Essential Depot seems to be one of the gold standard brands for oils and soap making supplies. The prices here are consistent with the main website, especially when you factor in shipping if you have prime. You can get slightly better deals on the main website but only if you order 1-2 gallons at a time. This stuff makes great soap!</li>
