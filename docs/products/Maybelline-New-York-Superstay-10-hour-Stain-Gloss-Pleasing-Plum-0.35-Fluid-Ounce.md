### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It tastes pleasant, too!!</li>
      <li>Great price for an excellent lip stain!</li>
      <li>This lip stain is a great fall color.</li>
      <li>very nice color</li>
      <li>I have been looking for something that isn&#x27;t too bright and something that would stay without needing to be touched up everytime</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good that it keeps</li>
      <li>Love this color!</li>
      <li>amazing price also.</li>
      <li>but if you want opaque to stay, it&#x27;s a look-don&#x27;t-touch kind of lip gloss.</li>
      <li>let it dry-then apply moisture top coat)</li>
      <li>, I love this color</li>
      <li>I love this one because the feel of it, it doesn&#x27;t feel cakey like most stains.</li>
      <li>it applies like a lip gloss but dries in a more matte color (doesnt stay shiny).</li>
      <li>This applied really smoothly and stayed on my lips all day!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the color of this</li>
      <li>I just wish I could find it in a lipstick, the stain has awesome lasting power</li>
      <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s more of a stain.</li>
      <li>This is a great product I was not too much into the color</li>
      <li>I am VERY particular with gloss as many brands are waxy and not lubricating</li>
      <li>it was the worth experience I ever had with Maybelline if it was  free return</li>
      <li>The gloss does not go smoothly, kind of messy, so you have to work it over the lips for nice application.</li>
      <li>but it looks more natural.</li>
      <li>pretty color.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite colors but the wand broke, on the second use...</li>
      <li>but I had also bought different colors that I really love.</li>
      <li>Better than the 12 hour varieties and only one application (vs applying color-</li>
      <li>this product really keeps lips moist for hours!</li>
      <li>I really like these stains, they last color wise a long time.</li>
      <li>Although it doesnt last 10 hours as advertised, it does last for at least one hour and the color is great :)</li>
      <li>and then the whole product is unusable.</li>
      <li>Wil buy more soon in other colors.</li>
      <li>but for such a blissful stain gloss, its worth reapplying.</li>
      <li>Glad I got it at a low price because its not worth much.</li>
      <li>A really light weight gloss, not even a little sticky that lasts quite some time.</li>

<li> Yeah a lot of people complain that it doesn&#x27;t last 10 hours,  which I don&#x27;t mind, but it does last a long while.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t last that long and the applicator is a bit awkward and breaks off easily</li>
<li> not cake or flake or dry your lips.</li>
<li> Its just like any other lip gloss that doesn&#x27;t stay on for long.  </li>
<li> but it doesn&#x27;t stay as dark as I&#x27;d like it to</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little dark</li>
<li> I am really upset and mad about your product.</li>
<li> This is crazy dark and it leaves lips very very dry.</li>
<li> The applicator brush is not nice, but it does the job.</li>
<li> It also made my lips feel weird and tight.</li>
<li> Poor  will not buy again  it&#x27; to watery</li>
<li> I was so mad when they discontinued these 10 hour lip stain.</li>
<li> soooo very sad :(</li>

    <li> Needs to be reapplied often.  I will not be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this on here because I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, I love this color and I like that it applies like a lip gloss but dries in a more matte color (doesnt stay shiny). Although it doesnt last 10 hours as advertised, it does last for at least one hour and the color is great :)</li>
    <li> This is a great product I was not too much into the color but I had also bought different colors that I really love.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the color of this I just wish I could find it in a lipstick, the stain has awesome lasting power but it doesn&#x27;t stay as dark as I&#x27;d like it to</li>
    <li> it was the worth experience I ever had with Maybelline if it was  free return I was returning the day I got. didn&#x27;t stay even a minute on my lip how you could advertise such this product as you say is Superstay 10 hour. I am really upset and mad about your product. I have to order different product that I alway order with Maybelline</li>
    <li> I had bought this from the store, but would like to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: it stays longer than regular lip glosses and lipsticks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it dries out your lips so you might want to apply Chapstick after it dries out. It&#x27;s good that it keeps it&#x27;s color after a while, but it looks more natural. The applicator brush is not nice, but it does the job. The gloss does not go smoothly, kind of messy, so you have to work it over the lips for nice application.</li>
    <li> Such a shame these are getting discontinued!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not cake or flake or dry your lips. A really light weight gloss, not even a little sticky that lasts quite some time. Definnitely not 10 hours... but for such a blissful stain gloss, its worth reapplying. It tastes pleasant, too!!</li>
    <li> Great price for an excellent lip stain!</li>
    <li> This lip stain is a great fall color. I have been looking for something that isn&#x27;t too bright and something that would stay without needing to be touched up everytime I take a drink of something. This applied really smoothly and stayed on my lips all day!</li>
    <li> Poor  will not buy again  it&#x27; to watery does not stay on  can&#x27;t see you have on</li>
    <li> Love this color! I was so mad when they discontinued these 10 hour lip stain. I love this one because the feel of it, it doesn&#x27;t feel cakey like most stains. Yeah a lot of people complain that it doesn&#x27;t last 10 hours,  which I don&#x27;t mind, but it does last a long while. Wil buy more soon in other colors.</li>
    <li> This does not stain you lips.  Its just like any other lip gloss that doesn&#x27;t stay on for long.  Glad I got it at a low price because its not worth much.</li>
    <li> This is crazy dark and it leaves lips very very dry. It also made my lips feel weird and tight.</li>
    <li> pretty color. I really like these stains, they last color wise a long time. They don&#x27;t stay glossy all day, but even after eating, drinking you can still see a shade of color. I believe they have been discontinued.  soooo very sad :(</li>
    <li> this product really keeps lips moist for hours! Better than the 12 hour varieties and only one application (vs applying color-let it dry-then apply moisture top coat) amazing price also. I am VERY particular with gloss as many brands are waxy and not lubricating</li>
    <li> very nice color but the color does not stay on</li>
    <li> Opaque but if you want opaque to stay, it&#x27;s a look-don&#x27;t-touch kind of lip gloss. Otherwise it&#x27;s more of a stain.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little dark but I can make it lighter when I put it on</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite colors but the wand broke, on the second use...</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last that long and the applicator is a bit awkward and breaks off easily and then the whole product is unusable.</li>
