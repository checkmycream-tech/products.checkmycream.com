      <li>Clear design and good size on the length.</li>
      <li>I got several attempts to get them placed correctly; they don&#x27;t stick too much to be moved around to the perfect spot.</li>
      <li>and I wish there were more in the pack but other than that they are great.</li>
      <li>they work great though I do wish there were a few more.</li>
      <li>but hey I&#x27;m always lookin for super cheap stuff</li>

      <li>very upset that they didn&#x27;t have many in the pack.</li>
      <li>They stick well and leave very crisp, clean lines when removed.</li>
      <li>The product was just as described, came in perfect condition and earlier than expected.</li>
      <li>If you peel them off to apply and touch them too much they lose their adheasive quickly.</li>
      <li>Overall I was satisfied with the purchase</li>
      <li>These were exactly what.</li>
      <li>They also work very well!</li>

<li> Only one small sheet... not at all satisfied...</li>
<li> i love them a lot but only bad part is you don&#x27;t get many for the price</li>
<li> Obsessed with chevrons right now and these are perf to make easy chevrons</li>
<li> There are a lot of stickers to last a nail artist, especially for the price and how much others sell chevron stickers for.</li>
<li> I did try different methods and if you apply your cuticle oil right before you apply the stickers they will peel off, so make sure your cuticle  oil and base coat are completely  dry.</li>
<li> They can go to both sides of any size nail with extra room on the sides to trim down.</li>
<li> Even if you keep your nails short, they are small enough to do two strips across.  </li>
<li> Exactly as I expected.</li>
<li> the size sheet that was received was not what I expected.</li>
<li> Arrived in a plain white letter envelope that was unmarked.</li>
<li> but only came I one little sheet!</li>
<li> But pretty expensive for just about 40 of them...</li>
<li> The stickers are a little flimsy and can rip if not taken off carefully</li>
<li> maybe $2, but not worth the money I paid.</li>
<li> but there was not many in the pack there was one little sheet not worth $4.</li>
<li> Expensive for the amount you get, but as long as you pull off when you nails are still wet</li>
<li> it was very small, and NOT worth $3.99.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just one small sheet of stickers.  </li>
<li> They don&#x27;t stick on the nail at all no matter how you try to use them, nor do they lay flat on your nail, making this product useless.</li>
<li> A little thin</li>
<li> They did come a day late but at least I received them.</li>
<li> I used them to create negative space on my nails.</li>
<li> Awfully expensive for not very many stickers.</li>
<li> Comes out not very impressive.</li>
<li> I thought it was too expensive for just one sheet.</li>

    <li> Been using these a lot since they arrived! Took a while to get to me but was exactly what I was hoping for when they did. The stickers are a little flimsy and can rip if not taken off carefully and I wish there were more in the pack but other than that they are great.</li>
    <li> Grand children loved them.</li>
    <li> These chevron stickers are great quality ... I would definitely purchase again ... I really recommend them ...</li>
    <li> These are a great product, I tried them on and they didn&#x27;t peel off they are perfect for sponging because they won&#x27;t peel off unlike other tapes I&#x27;ve tried.

    <li> I love these! They stick nicely. They got here in a decent amount of time. I recommend them to anyone looking to buy chevron vinyls.</li>
    <li> Great item. Item is as advertised! Great shipping time!</li>
    <li> Was expecting more only one small sheet. Don&#x27;t think I will purchase again</li>
    <li> These nail stickers are FANTASTIC. I used them to create negative space on my nails. They stick well and leave very crisp, clean lines when removed. I got several attempts to get them placed correctly; they don&#x27;t stick too much to be moved around to the perfect spot. I&#x27;m really impressed!</li>
    <li> Exactly as I expected.</li>
    <li> These are great! A little thin so they break from time to time but don&#x27;t they all. You can&#x27;t beat the customer service. A pleasure to do business with!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and long lasting when used with Gel polish as top coat.  Would recommend.  I plan to get more in different colors.</li>
    <li> i love them a lot but only bad part is you don&#x27;t get many for the price but isn&#x27;t a problem. they are just decent for price. The stickers themselves are Great and came on time and work great. Great purchase just wish it wasn&#x27;t 4 bucks for that many but hey I&#x27;m always lookin for super cheap stuff so that&#x27;s just my opinion but honestly they are really great</li>
    <li> Stickers stay in place and under bleeding. Work great!</li>
    <li> Very strong adhesive that will peel the nail polish underneath up (I painted the first coat on and waited 12 hrs before putting the stickers on and then the top coat and it still peeled up the bottom coat). I would leave the stickers on if you use these</li>
    <li> Clear design and good size on the length. They can go to both sides of any size nail with extra room on the sides to trim down. Con is they don&#x27;t stay on well. If you peel them off to apply and touch them too much they lose their adheasive quickly.</li>
    <li> My child says she loves it.</li>
    <li> These are great stickers.  Even if you keep your nails short, they are small enough to do two strips across.  They seem to cost a little more than the others you can find here on Amazon.  But they are a good quality and shipped fast.</li>
    <li> I like these and use them frequently, but they should be longer for toes.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE! They are easy to use, the polish doesn&#x27;t bleed through to leave messy lines. I would buy these again any time! The shipping was so fast they got here in no time</li>

    <li> I was so happy when I saw what I got. There are a lot of stickers to last a nail artist, especially for the price and how much others sell chevron stickers for. I got my stickers in the an envelope decorated with cute little stickers and the stickers came within a week! IN LOVE with them!!!! They also work very well! You don&#x27;t have to guess twice about buying something from this company!&lt;br /&gt;😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Love these stickers!! Great price and quality! Shipping literally took about 2 days from CA and I&#x27;m in NY! Could not have asked for a better product!!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.. Very HAppy with my purchase !!!!!!!!  Thank you !</li>
    <li> Looked great when I used them</li>
    <li> Love them! Easy to use!</li>
    <li> Came off after 2 days.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and item as described but only came I one little sheet! I thought it was too expensive for just one sheet.</li>
    <li> Expensive for the amount you get, but as long as you pull off when you nails are still wet you get a clean line.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a plain white letter envelope that was unmarked. I almost threw it away. It&#x27;s just one small sheet of stickers.  Awfully expensive for not very many stickers. They didn&#x27;t work at all. According to the seller, these are not meant to be guides.  They are supposed to be stickers that stay on your nails.  However, they do not work that way either. They don&#x27;t stick on the nail at all no matter how you try to use them, nor do they lay flat on your nail, making this product useless.</li>
    <li> very cute got them fast. but there was not many in the pack there was one little sheet not worth $4. very upset that they didn&#x27;t have many in the pack.</li>
    <li> I was expecting more than one sheet for $4.00... But I also didn&#x27;t read &amp;#34;40 nail decals&amp;#34; 😔</li>
    <li> Came quickly and in an adorable little envelope! I use these for an outline to peel up after painting so I am unsure how they stick they look great quality, I would recommend these!!!</li>
    <li> I was very unhappy with this. Yes they do work they stick and come of easy. But the picture that was on here when I bought them was huge. These came to my house and their smaller than a playing card. There&#x27;s also only 20 that came with mine and that&#x27;s not a lot at all. I thought the price was a good idea, it&#x27;s not.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves all the designs she can do with these.</li>
    <li> I really like these for my short nails and they work really great!</li>
    <li> I do my nails a lot and they were really cute with a chevron and cheaper than the nail salon</li>
    <li> the size sheet that was received was not what I expected. it was very small, and NOT worth $3.99. maybe $2, but not worth the money I paid.</li>
    <li> Comes out not very impressive. A tutorial on how to use would have been helpful</li>
    <li> Those things r the best it&#x27;s a great price and they just work amazingly I recommend them</li>
    <li> Only one small sheet... not at all satisfied...</li>
    <li> good quality fast shipping</li>
    <li> Love them!! But pretty expensive for just about 40 of them... Other than tht it was worth it Becuz it came in 4 days!!!!</li>
    <li> These are absolutely the best stickers!! A must buy</li>
