### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>is the best product I have put on my face yet!</li>
      <li>My wife uses this and loves it, her complexion has improved wonderfully  </li>
      <li>Very happy with the way my skin feels.</li>
      <li>like I Said Just Great!</li>
      <li>it is a very good</li>
      <li>product is a good investment if used as directed.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the ANR for over a month now, and my skin does not look as good as it did when using youth code.</li>
      <li>Skin good absorption.</li>
      <li>but the quality of the product is good.</li>
      <li>After using L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code serum and day moisturizer, I decided to try Estee Lauder advanced night repair given that I saw that it received very good reviews.</li>
      <li>This product is really nice to use at night.</li>
      <li>It is Fine!</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I stopped using it and the skin got better.  </li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>skin as the days goes on becomes more toned, radiant, and photo</li>
      <li>but I need more than one drop.</li>
      <li>you will love it.</li>
      <li>apply around my eyes mostly and the neck</li>
      <li>love this.  </li>
      <li>She has been using it for many years.</li>
      <li>My wife&#x27;s favorite.</li>
      <li>I was glad to find in on Amazon.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I thought it should be a good one with good package in such price.</li>
      <li>Although the cost may seem prohibitive, the serum lasts a really long time (not something you will be replacing monthly) and the results, healthier,smoother more beautiful skin, justify the expense.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>So I strongly doubt in originality of the product.</li>
      <li>it is very good product.i will take it for a long time from now on.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Advanced Night Repair for about two weeks now</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never found a product that could almost eliminate all of my brown spots until I discovered Estee Lauder&#x27;s Advanced Night Repair.  </li>
      <li>It makes my skin so smooth, too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light so it absorbs into the skin quickly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it is helping, but it will probably take another several months for me to be able to see the results.  </li>
      <li>She has dry skin and says this is really good for her face and neck.</li>
      <li>My skin is soft, and very comfortable.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Totally worth it-</li>
      <li>We are both in our mid sixties and healthy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 69 years old and this product keeps my skin hydrated and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I first tried this as a gift with purchase.  </li>
      <li>Pretty good, fully satisfied, the product was what I expected, I received exactly what I expected, i highly recommend,</li>
      <li>The product page has been updated but many reviews were written about the previous, original product.</li>
      <li>Some people told me that the next time I better buy it in the Estee Lauder store, but since the product didn&#x27;t really do anything to my skin, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying it again anytime soon.</li>
      <li>The youth code did a better job on diminishing fine lines and the overall appearance of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I actually did see results with Estee Lauder ANR and would recommend it.</li>
      <li>After two weeks of nightly use and comparisons, I could not see any difference between the two (which suggests to me that the serum was not doing much).</li>
      <li>This product really works well.</li>
      <li>30mL is not that much amount..</li>
      <li>I am a senior who has spent many years in the sun.  </li>
      <li>Is was shipped fast but the bottle was chipped from every angle and it was used...</li>
      <li>The price extremely is also lovable, hoped can continue to maintain.</li>
      <li>Although its a night time solution, I feel that it also works fast if you feel like you want that instant fix just to kinda freshen up a freshly washed night time face.</li>
      <li>( I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I normally don&#x27;t use products that are not organic and contains perfume but this one is the exception.</li>
      <li>Terrible!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Recovery Complex 1oz / 30 ML from Golden Dragon seller.</li>
      <li>There was marked refinement in skin tone and texture, reduction of pores.  </li>
      <li>I mean I did not miss a single night,the difference was amazing.  </li>
      <li>At time of purchase, the product offered was the original Complex.</li>

<li> The only plus is that the 30 ml bottle lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> it has very strong unpleasant smell; all previous Estee Lauder products have very soft smell.</li>
<li> Items received in proper packaging &amp; 1 day earlier than expected.</li>
<li> I have since had the opportunity to try other, less expensive serums which have given me much better results.</li>
<li> It is a small bottle containing a clear serum.  </li>

<li> It&#x27;s little bit smaller than I thought...</li>
<li> I&#x27;m starting this product rather late in life, and have only been using it for about a month.  </li>
<li> After applied the product a few times on my face, the skin of my forhead started to peel and turned red.  </li>
<li> It may well work for other people, but when a product makes such extravagant claims, I expect to see at least a moderate improvement.</li>
<li> It is odorless and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Sorry because we all like to believe in a miracle cure, and sorry because I wasted a fair amount of cash.</li>
<li> I continued to use up the bottle (as it had been such an expensive purchase) but, sadly, my skin did not respond any better.</li>
<li> I applied serum plus cream to one side of my face, and cream alone to the other.</li>
<li> Because, by its nature, a serum is a carrier (i.e. it prepares the skin for the active cream that follows)</li>
<li> Cheap goods is not good，I am very disappointed that the product is old , there are eight months maturity。It won&#x27;t buy again。</li>
<li> The price on amazon was much less than in department stores.</li>
<li> Maybe a slight increase in even skin tone but that is it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  </li>
<li> so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try instead of going through the trouble to return it...</li>
<li> You apply a small amount to your face at night, then follow with your mositurizer.</li>
<li> : I keep getting asked if I bought the Complex II, and the answer is NO.</li>
<li> Six months ago my wife and I tried Olay&#x27;s Eye Restoration Complex.</li>
<li> it is worse than my image.</li>
<li> Unfortunately it is too expensive to be included in my daily routine, too bad :0</li>
<li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that this highly-touted, award-winning serum failed to impress me.</li>
<li> it is difficult to evaluate its effectiveness in isolation.</li>
<li> Bad package.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using it EVERY DAY for two months now, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any change :(.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product. I normally don&#x27;t use products that are not organic and contains perfume but this one is the exception. I am on my second bottle and my skin loves me for it. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because of the price.</li>
    <li> Six months ago my wife and I tried Olay&#x27;s Eye Restoration Complex. It was part of a package of three Olay products designed to combat aging (wrinkles, under eye &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34;, age lines). We are both in our mid sixties and healthy.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this and loves it, her complexion has improved wonderfully  She has shown her iprovments to others and they are now using it</li>
    <li> Love it but I need more than one drop. Which is what I thought I&#x27;d be using. Very happy with the way my skin feels.</li>
    <li> I received this instead of the cream that I ordered so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try instead of going through the trouble to return it... I couldn&#x27;t tell that this product done anything or made any difference.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.Skin good absorption.The price extremely is also lovable, hoped can continue to maintain.I can recommend to the friends.</li>
    <li> My 88-yr-old grandmother, who is in a nursing home, will only use Estee Lauder products, has for decades. She has dry skin and says this is really good for her face and neck. Hydrating without being greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that this highly-touted, award-winning serum failed to impress me. Sorry because we all like to believe in a miracle cure, and sorry because I wasted a fair amount of cash. I started using this product at night, topping it with a night cream as per recommendation on the box. Because, by its nature, a serum is a carrier (i.e. it prepares the skin for the active cream that follows) it is difficult to evaluate its effectiveness in isolation. The only way is to compare results between the combo of the serum plus cream, versus the cream alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I had not noticed any quantifiable results after two months of regular use, I carried out an experiment: I applied serum plus cream to one side of my face, and cream alone to the other. After two weeks of nightly use and comparisons, I could not see any difference between the two (which suggests to me that the serum was not doing much). I continued to use up the bottle (as it had been such an expensive purchase) but, sadly, my skin did not respond any better. I have since had the opportunity to try other, less expensive serums which have given me much better results. It may well work for other people, but when a product makes such extravagant claims, I expect to see at least a moderate improvement. The only plus is that the 30 ml bottle lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I keep getting asked if I bought the Complex II, and the answer is NO. At time of purchase, the product offered was the original Complex. The product page has been updated but many reviews were written about the previous, original product. Also, the selling price is now half of what I paid which makes a bit of difference to the overall satisfaction rating.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Advanced Night Repair for about two weeks now and I love it. My skin is soft, and very comfortable. Unfortunately it is too expensive to be included in my daily routine, too bad :0( I highly recommend this product.</li>

    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite. She has been using it for many years. The price on amazon was much less than in department stores.</li>
    <li> Bad package. looks like a booth goods. it is worse than my image. I thought it should be a good one with good package in such price.</li>
    <li> I am a senior who has spent many years in the sun.  I&#x27;ve never found a product that could almost eliminate all of my brown spots until I discovered Estee Lauder&#x27;s Advanced Night Repair.  It makes my skin so smooth, too.</li>
    <li> Cheap goods is not good，I am very disappointed that the product is old , there are eight months maturity。It won&#x27;t buy again。</li>
    <li> have use this product for years.  love this.  apply around my eyes mostly and the neck area.&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend. you will love it.</li>
    <li> I first tried this as a gift with purchase.  It is a small bottle containing a clear serum.  You apply a small amount to your face at night, then follow with your mositurizer. It is odorless and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, I noticed nothing. However after four weeks for religious use and by that I mean I did not miss a single night,the difference was amazing.  There was marked refinement in skin tone and texture, reduction of pores.  Additionallhy, my skins is softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a good investment if used as directed.  Although the cost may seem prohibitive, the serum lasts a really long time (not something you will be replacing monthly) and the results, healthier,smoother more beautiful skin, justify the expense.</li>
    <li> This has improved my skin from the inside out.&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth it- skin as the days goes on becomes more toned, radiant, and photo perfect.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best product I have put on my face yet!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it EVERY DAY for two months now, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any change :(. Some people told me that the next time I better buy it in the Estee Lauder store, but since the product didn&#x27;t really do anything to my skin, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying it again anytime soon.</li>
    <li> It is Fine! It&#x27;s little bit smaller than I thought...30mL is not that much amount..but the quality of the product is good.</li>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t send this for weeks and I was not able to verify the real Estee Lauder product is in the bottle. It didn&#x27;t come sealed!</li>
    <li> I have used it religiously for the last two months. I do not notice a difference at all. Maybe a slight increase in even skin tone but that is it.</li>
    <li> This product is really nice to use at night. It&#x27;s light so it absorbs into the skin quickly. Smells like it has a bit of tea tree oil. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it didn&#x27;t come in a box though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m starting this product rather late in life, and have only been using it for about a month.  I&#x27;m sure it is helping, but it will probably take another several months for me to be able to see the results.  Even if I don&#x27;t, I think I will keep using it just because I think you need all the help you can get for your skin as you age.</li>
    <li> Items received in proper packaging &amp; 1 day earlier than expected. Everything looks the same as the one I bought over the counter.</li>
    <li> it is very good product.i will take it for a long time from now on. it is a very good</li>
    <li> This product really works well. Although its a night time solution, I feel that it also works fast if you feel like you want that instant fix just to kinda freshen up a freshly washed night time face. I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> the quality was NOT the same as in store purchase. I&#x27;ve used it for 17 years. I know this product was altered. It was the consistancy of water not a serum</li>
    <li> Pretty good, fully satisfied, the product was what I expected, I received exactly what I expected, i highly recommend, like I Said Just Great!</li>
    <li> After using L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code serum and day moisturizer, I decided to try Estee Lauder advanced night repair given that I saw that it received very good reviews. I&#x27;ve been using the ANR for over a month now, and my skin does not look as good as it did when using youth code. The youth code did a better job on diminishing fine lines and the overall appearance of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I actually did see results with Estee Lauder ANR and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Is was shipped fast but the bottle was chipped from every angle and it was used...this was a present for someone so I ended up buying another one at the store.</li>
    <li> Terrible!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Recovery Complex 1oz / 30 ML from Golden Dragon seller. And it came without the box and any instructions. Also there was no protection wrap, so no one knows whether it was used or not. How can they sell such products???&lt;br /&gt;Also it has very strong unpleasant smell; all previous Estee Lauder products have very soft smell. So I strongly doubt in originality of the product.</li>
    <li> After applied the product a few times on my face, the skin of my forhead started to peel and turned red.  I stopped using it and the skin got better.  I would not recommand this product.</li>
