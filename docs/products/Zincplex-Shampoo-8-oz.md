### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product!</li>
      <li>This shampoo is great!</li>
      <li>Excellent product.</li>
      <li>Very good product for itchy scalp.  </li>
      <li>Head pimples and oily scalp went away and my hair feels great.</li>
      <li>Works great for acne on scalp.</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>I think this shampoo is great for cleaning the hair and also helps with scalp bumps, (acne.)</li>
      <li>This shampoo is really good in controlling my scalp problems.</li>
      <li>I find the smell appealing too!</li>
      <li>It was amazing.  </li>
      <li>husband really liked for dandruff too.</li>
      <li>It does leave my hair very clean though!</li>
      <li>but I had really nice shiny healthy hair.</li>
      <li>my hair and scalp are much healthier and the acne on my scalp is already so much better - one happy customer</li>
      <li>but this shampoo didn&#x27;t do any better than the store brand that i&#x27;ve been using.</li>
      <li>Makes your scalp feel clean and nice scent.</li>
      <li>It is a gel like shampoo that surprisingly lathers very well.  </li>
      <li>I am unsure of why this is, but it works fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>He has been using this product for six months and he has noticed a HUGE improvement.</li>
      <li>Zincplex smells good, is not harsh at all.</li>
      <li>Also did not seem to help significantly with scalp issues.</li>
      <li>Some of the bumps/patches/scales seemed to reduce somewhat but this product did not cure or significantly reduce his scalp condition (Seborrheic Dermatitus).</li>
      <li>My hair feels exceptionally clean after I use it</li>
      <li>After this, we switched to a combination of Sea Salt and Jojoba oil which works much better without the intense skin drying/flaking.</li>
      <li>I even do a quick wash on my face while washing my hair since it leaves your skin feeling squeaky clean.  </li>
      <li>Hands down this is the best product I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
      <li>and I would recommend it for anyone who wants a good shampoo fir deep cleansing of your scalp.</li>
      <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
      <li>It was very unusual for me.  </li>
      <li>I thought it was because I lived in a hot, humid area and my head was sweaty/oily at the roots of my hair.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what I needed it to do.</li>
      <li>The first two bottles of Zincplex was like a miracle.</li>
      <li>With the first use, you feel a skin tightening.</li>
      <li>After the first use, that sensation seems to go away.</li>
      <li>If you have short, non color treated hair with very mild scalp issues, this might work for you.</li>
      <li>It is also supposed to prevent certain types of cancer.</li>
      <li>Id highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
      <li>THIS PRODUCT REALLY WORKS........</li>
      <li>HELPS DEEP CLEAN SCALP</li>
      <li>I stopped using matching moisturizer with my regular brand shampoo; Paul Mitchell tea tree special.</li>
      <li>I have told many about it including my hairdresser since she informed me that several of her clients have a similar problem.</li>
      <li>If you have any sort of scalp problem, I would highly recommend trying this product.</li>
      <li>It is the first one that I have had success with other than a prescription.  </li>
      <li>I shampoo once a day using minimal water to ensure full concentration.  </li>
      <li>I had to go to my hair dresser to get a professional conditioning treatment</li>
      <li>I found that this product help to reduce some of the scalp sores that I had developed, but it never got rid of them all, despite my rigorous and thorough use of this product.  </li>
      <li>This is not an issue for me, maybe its just bringing out my natural color.</li>
      <li>The dermatologist said it was adult acne.  </li>
      <li>I developed scabs on my head.</li>
      <li>I am not sure, kind of curious if anyone else has this problem?&lt;br</li>
      <li>After three days of use I&#x27;ve noticed my scalp is starting to heal, and my hair has never felt so soft.</li>
      <li>Someone noticed that my hair color has slightly changed from light to dark.</li>
      <li>My hair is completely damaged, frizzy and dry.</li>

<li> Well they were an allergic reaction to using the same dang shampoo &amp; moisturizer for too long.</li>

<li> This shampoo failed to sufficiently clean my scalp and hair.</li>
<li> What this product did do was to dry his scalp to a point that it caused severe flaking.</li>
<li> He had oily hair and a very dry scalp to the point of sores and itching.</li>
<li> After reading the reviews, I had expected this shampoo to be the answer to my scalp problems.</li>
<li> Its not very often that I write reviews</li>
<li> Have scalp acne and this shampoo is the only one I&#x27;ve tried so far that doesn&#x27;t plaster my hair flat or dry it out, and actually clears up the (sometimes painful) acne.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> Not sure if it is related to some other probelm I&#x27;m having,</li>
<li> tried lots of other concoctions, nothing worked, but</li>

<li> Dried out and did not play well with my long color treated hair.</li>
<li> I was skeptical but it really does work.</li>
<li> It seems to have calmed my problem down.</li>
<li> We got this for my boyfriend: He used it for a little over a month.</li>
<li> I have had still a few bumps.</li>
<li> It dried my head out</li>
<li> All the money I spent on other products in a desperate attempt to cure what the doctors couldn&#x27;t and this simple shampoo did it.  </li>
<li> That being said, it did make a little bit of a difference, and certainly didn&#x27;t make matters any worse, so I can&#x27;t say that it was completely useless.</li>
<li> This extremely expensive shampoo got rid of the bumps after using only 1 bottle of it.</li>
<li> I was annoyed by having little bumps on my scalp.</li>
<li> and I have thick hair.</li>
<li> just unbelievable!</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m so disappointed because this product was recommended to by a dermatologist for my scalp and it hasn&#x27;t worked so back to the dermatologist</li>
<li> I was very disappointed that it did absolutely nothing.</li>
<li> This is absolutely the worst shampoo I have ever tried.</li>
<li> not worth the money, does nothing for you hair, smells bad.</li>
<li> I was using a lot of expensive salon shampoos.</li>
<li> All dandruff products dry out his scalp and make his head break out terribly.</li>
<li> My husband suffers from acne on his head, not dandruff.</li>
<li> Nothing bad but a tightening.</li>
<li> Got rid of painful bumps on my head.</li>
<li> My scalp and dandruff are twice as worst.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great for acne on scalp.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is really good in controlling my scalp problems. It is the first one that I have had success with other than a prescription.  I have told many about it including my hairdresser since she informed me that several of her clients have a similar problem.</li>
    <li> This shampoo failed to sufficiently clean my scalp and hair.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the worst shampoo I have ever tried. I have dandruff but I had really nice shiny healthy hair. Not after a week using this product. My scalp and dandruff are twice as worst. I developed scabs on my head. My hair is completely damaged, frizzy and dry. I had to go to my hair dresser to get a professional conditioning treatment and it&#x27;s still damaged. Mind you I don&#x27;t color treat my hair and I don&#x27;t use heat on it all the damage came in one week from this product.</li>
    <li> Dried out and did not play well with my long color treated hair. Also did not seem to help significantly with scalp issues. If you have short, non color treated hair with very mild scalp issues, this might work for you.</li>
    <li> I think this shampoo is great for cleaning the hair and also helps with scalp bumps, (acne.) husband really liked for dandruff too.</li>
    <li> The first two bottles of Zincplex was like a miracle. The sores and inching on my scalp disappeared. However the last bottle I ordered has had a lesser effect. Perhaps I am building up a resistance to the Zincplex.......</li>
    <li> my hair and scalp are much healthier and the acne on my scalp is already so much better - one happy customer</li>
    <li> burns the heck out of your sore scalp.</li>
    <li> I bought this item because the back of my head had bumps and was itchy. Since I have been using Zincplex regularly, both of these are gone. I was skeptical but it really does work. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Will be reordering soon. My husband had acne breakout on his scalp and it have improved since using!</li>
    <li> tried lots of other concoctions, nothing worked, but this stuff.  I swear by it to get rid of my scalp sores.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Got rid of painful bumps on my head. Its not very often that I write reviews but this product deserves 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I found that this product help to reduce some of the scalp sores that I had developed, but it never got rid of them all, despite my rigorous and thorough use of this product.  That being said, it did make a little bit of a difference, and certainly didn&#x27;t make matters any worse, so I can&#x27;t say that it was completely useless.</li>
    <li> It dried my head out and I&#x27;m so disappointed because this product was recommended to by a dermatologist for my scalp and it hasn&#x27;t worked so back to the dermatologist I got</li>
    <li> Solved a problem I have had for years. Head pimples and oily scalp went away and my hair feels great.</li>
    <li> Makes your scalp feel clean and nice scent.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I will continue to purchase this item.</li>
    <li> The shampoo works well and I would recommend it for anyone who wants a good shampoo fir deep cleansing of your scalp.</li>
    <li> permanent cure for my itchy scalp. just unbelievable!</li>
    <li> Was having burning and itching before using this.  It seems to have calmed my problem down.</li>
    <li> This product arrived leaking. Not a lot, but it was leaking. We got this for my boyfriend: He used it for a little over a month. With the first use, you feel a skin tightening. Nothing bad but a tightening. After the first use, that sensation seems to go away. Some of the bumps/patches/scales seemed to reduce somewhat but this product did not cure or significantly reduce his scalp condition (Seborrheic Dermatitus). What this product did do was to dry his scalp to a point that it caused severe flaking. In addition, for those that keep track this product dues use Sodium Laureth Sulfate. After this, we switched to a combination of Sea Salt and Jojoba oil which works much better without the intense skin drying/flaking.</li>
    <li> I ordered to my husband, and it did not work for him</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I had expected this shampoo to be the answer to my scalp problems. I was very disappointed that it did absolutely nothing. It does leave my hair very clean though!</li>
    <li> bought product for husband. He has acne on the back of his scalp . This product looked as though it was starting to dry them up but then  they all came back plus some.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week now and can already see a difference. I have had still a few bumps. Someone noticed that my hair color has slightly changed from light to dark. This is not an issue for me, maybe its just bringing out my natural color. I am not sure, kind of curious if anyone else has this problem?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a wash towel to apply this as recommended. I am unsure of why this is, but it works fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say after the 1 week usage I have seen a 60% reduction in zits in my hair.</li>
    <li> Hands down this is the best product I&#x27;ve used so far. After three days of use I&#x27;ve noticed my scalp is starting to heal, and my hair has never felt so soft. I definitely would reccommend this product to anyone suffering from scalp acne. THIS PRODUCT REALLY WORKS........</li>
    <li> Have scalp acne and this shampoo is the only one I&#x27;ve tried so far that doesn&#x27;t plaster my hair flat or dry it out, and actually clears up the (sometimes painful) acne.</li>
    <li> not worth the money, does nothing for you hair, smells bad. all of these are reasons you should not buy this product.</li>
    <li> HELPS DEEP CLEAN SCALP</li>
    <li> My husband suffers from acne on his head, not dandruff. All dandruff products dry out his scalp and make his head break out terribly. He has been using this product for six months and he has noticed a HUGE improvement. Totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> I suffer from head and face sweating and I have thick hair. I find this product controls my itching issues I get from my scalp problems. A little goes a long way. I find the smell appealing too!</li>
    <li> Bought this because of problems I&#x27;m having with my scalp.  Not sure if it is related to some other probelm I&#x27;m having, but this shampoo didn&#x27;t do any better than the store brand that i&#x27;ve been using.</li>
    <li> WAS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH SCALP BUMPS. I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR 2 MONTHS AND&lt;br /&gt;HAVEN&#x27;T HAD ANY PROBLEMS SINCE. MY SCALP HAS CLEARED UP.</li>
    <li> About 80-90% of scalp rash (red bumps) has gone away with using Zincplex shampoo.  Improvement was noticed after 2 weeks and the effect has lasted for about 2 months now.  I shampoo once a day using minimal water to ensure full concentration.  I leave it on for 3-5 minutes before rinsing it out.</li>
    <li> Very good product for itchy scalp.  Recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> It worked. I had those bumps at the crown of my scalp. I didn&#x27;t know what they were; zits or cancer. Well they were an allergic reaction to using the same dang shampoo &amp; moisturizer for too long. This extremely expensive shampoo got rid of the bumps after using only 1 bottle of it. I stopped using matching moisturizer with my regular brand shampoo; Paul Mitchell tea tree special. Just spray a detangler now and guess what the bumps haven&#x27;t come back!</li>
    <li> I was annoyed by having little bumps on my scalp. I thought it was because I lived in a hot, humid area and my head was sweaty/oily at the roots of my hair. I don&#x27;t have acne anywhere. I was using a lot of expensive salon shampoos. This is my Go To shampoo now. When I use it, there&#x27;s not one bump. Zero. It does exactly what I needed it to do.</li>
    <li> I was having problems with breakouts in my hair line.  It was very unusual for me.  The dermatologist said it was adult acne.  Nothing I tried would make it go away.  A friend suggested Zincplex. It had cured her teenagers scalp problem. He had oily hair and a very dry scalp to the point of sores and itching. Zincplex worked within days for him. Zincplex cured my scalp problem also.  It was amazing.  All the money I spent on other products in a desperate attempt to cure what the doctors couldn&#x27;t and this simple shampoo did it.  Zincplex smells good, is not harsh at all. It is a gel like shampoo that surprisingly lathers very well.  My husband uses it also. I even do a quick wash on my face while washing my hair since it leaves your skin feeling squeaky clean.  If you have any sort of scalp problem, I would highly recommend trying this product. It might be the only one you have to buy. Oh and I use my regular conditioner since I prefer a heavier conditioner.  I continue to order Zincplex shampoo. I wish I could find it locally.</li>
    <li> Seems to help scalp acne and sores. After trying several products and dermatologist antibiotics which I didn&#x27;t want to take long term. I have found that 2000iu of vitamin D3 twice a day cured my acne, head sores and helps my skin heal quicker. It is also supposed to prevent certain types of cancer. Hope this helps. It took me 2 years to figure this out.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great! I was worried it would make my hair frizzy, like other dandruff shampoos tend to, but it doesnt at all. My hair feels exceptionally clean after I use it and it got rid of all the dandruff. Id highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
