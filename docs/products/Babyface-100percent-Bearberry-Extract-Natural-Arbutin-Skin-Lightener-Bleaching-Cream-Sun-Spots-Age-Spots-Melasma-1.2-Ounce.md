      <li>Most companies will refund cosmetic items without the need to pay return postage (it can&#x27;t be resold</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I have a light freckle/spot on my face (very light).</li>
      <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was working, but I decided I would use it for the full 8 weeks recommended just to give it a good shot</li>
      <li>The product is not greasy, which I like, and easy to use.  </li>

      <li>It goes on and leaves a very, very slight moist/oily feel that is more pleasant that it sounds.</li>
      <li>The serum also seems to play nice with my many other products.</li>
      <li>I really do not understand the good reviews.</li>
      <li>Really worth buying it</li>
      <li>That aside, the product did arrive fresh.</li>
      <li>I felt the advertisement stating &amp;#34;not&amp;#34; to use full strength because it could bleach too much is misleading.</li>

      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anybody that is interested in the upkeep of there skin</li>

      <li>Works great on my black skin, I would definitely buy it again!</li>
      <li>I have very noticeable melasma that I&#x27;ve been to the dermatologist for and gotten prescription strength hydroquinone cream and peels for.</li>
      <li>My mom uses this for her age spots and she also really likes it.</li>
      <li>I also do a use Ole Henriksen Lemon Strip Flash Peel once or twice a week and exfoliate with Philosophy Microdelivery Exfoliating Wash on days as well as washing with a gentle cleanser every night before bed.</li>
      <li>I used the whole bottle over a 2 month period and did not notice any improvement to the age spots on my face.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I see a noticeable improvement and am not having to use as much of the spot covering product on my brown spots.  </li>
      <li>Been using it for a month results are not as much as I hoped for.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 30 with a fair complexion but was raised in Florida, so I was covered in uneven-looking spots and freckles on my face and upper chest, and also have a fairly dark melasma spot on my chin that I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of for years.</li>
      <li>I assumed this would just fade the spots but the overall tone of the skin is also getting lighter and more even looking, and just look smoother and younger because of the even skin tone.</li>
      <li>I am older and it could taker longer</li>
      <li>The ongoing results are enough to prove to me that it&#x27;s worth the upkeep and diligence.</li>
      <li>Being a light skinned blonde, my skin is definitely showing the effects of years in the sun.</li>
      <li>and now I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised!</li>
      <li>I simply wet a Qtip and apply full strength to areas I want to lighten.</li>
      <li>but it does help clear redness and brown spots</li>
      <li>works so far....</li>
      <li>I tried this product based on the postive feedback and because it is a natural product.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money</li>
      <li>skin soft..</li>
      <li>I also purchased other items (71.99 worth of stuff).</li>
      <li>and now I can definitely see a large improvement, especially in my hands.</li>
      <li>I mix a dropper of the extract with Dr Dennis Gross Ferulic Plus Retinol Anti-Aging Moisturizer and apply it at night followed a few minutes later by Alpha Hydrox Spot Light Targeted Skin Lightener.</li>

    <li> I am very satisfied with the product how my skin feel and look. I would recommend this product to anybody that is interested in the upkeep of there skin</li>
    <li> I think this is working!  I see a noticeable improvement and am not having to use as much of the spot covering product on my brown spots.  The product is not greasy, which I like, and easy to use.  The insert advises to mix a few drops with moisturizer but I have been using it full strength on the target areas.  It&#x27;s the best product I have found to fade brown spots.</li>

    <li> works so far.... great product.  I will order it again... very satisfied with this product!!! I would recommend this product.</li>

    <li> Removes age spots quickly I am 65 and this product works great on myself and my husband.  Try it for a month you will be amazed.</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell whether this product will remove age spots, but so far it hasn&#x27;t made the matter worse.</li>
    <li> This product does work - but not the way the manufacturer tells you to use it.  I simply wet a Qtip and apply full strength to areas I want to lighten.</li>
    <li> been using for close to a month now, small improvement and will give it another month to achieve desired effect.</li>
    <li> I have very noticeable melasma that I&#x27;ve been to the dermatologist for and gotten prescription strength hydroquinone cream and peels for. While they did help, the slight fading only lasted as long as I kept up with doctor visits. I mix a dropper of the extract with Dr Dennis Gross Ferulic Plus Retinol Anti-Aging Moisturizer and apply it at night followed a few minutes later by Alpha Hydrox Spot Light Targeted Skin Lightener. I also do a use Ole Henriksen Lemon Strip Flash Peel once or twice a week and exfoliate with Philosophy Microdelivery Exfoliating Wash on days as well as washing with a gentle cleanser every night before bed. Yeah, it&#x27;s a lot of products and steps, but since the addition of Babyface Bearberry extract, I&#x27;ve finally seen a noticeable difference in fading of my melasma. The ongoing results are enough to prove to me that it&#x27;s worth the upkeep and diligence.</li>
    <li> Works well on post blemish marks.</li>
    <li> I saw this product on Dr. Oz and decided to try this extract for the value. I didn&#x27;t have a cream to mix it with, so I just bought the company&#x27;s aloe moisturizer to mix with, and added about 1/4 of the bottle of Bearberry to the jar of cream. I have been using this on my hands and arms once daily at night for sun damage and freckles. My goal was mostly to just get rid of the freckles and the spotty appearance I was starting to get. Being a light skinned blonde, my skin is definitely showing the effects of years in the sun. I have to say, it&#x27;s been about 4 weeks and now I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised! At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was working, but I decided I would use it for the full 8 weeks recommended just to give it a good shot and now I can definitely see a large improvement, especially in my hands. They look almost 10 years younger and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased! I find myself holding out my hands all the time, admiring them. They still have some of their age spots, but those are definitely lightening up too.  I assumed this would just fade the spots but the overall tone of the skin is also getting lighter and more even looking, and just look smoother and younger because of the even skin tone. It was just a nice surprise. I&#x27;m glad I purchased this, and I&#x27;m looking forward to the weeks ahead. This will definitely be a permanent part of my beauty regime from now on.</li>
    <li> My skin looks much better after using this product for sometime now. I used this for uneven skin tone on my legs, and also used this to lighten the hyper pigmentation spots I have from pimples. My mom uses this for her age spots and she also really likes it. I used to go to my derm and had a prescription hydroquinone cream and that took probably 2 months for me to see change and it was expensive, so I started looking for alternatives. I am very happy with the bearberry and will be buying it again when this runs out. It always takes time to work, but this definitely works. I do a good scrub 2-3 times a week on the areas I am trying to lighten, and I think that helps. My derm had me use an AHA cream also when I was bleaching before, so I still do that now, along with the weekly scrubs.</li>
    <li> First the cap doesn&#x27;t close on the dropper bottle. That aside, the product did arrive fresh. I used it faithfully &amp;#34;full strength&amp;#34; and saw no results in three weeks. I then contacted the company and they stated it could take a &amp;#34;year&amp;#34; to see results depending on the pigmentation issue. I have a light freckle/spot on my face (very light). I let the company know I felt the advertisement stating &amp;#34;not&amp;#34; to use full strength because it could bleach too much is misleading. The company will allow you to return the item for refund, but tried to talk me out of it. For this reason, I do not trust this company. I know when an item was advertised as a &amp;#34;powerhouse&amp;#34; when it is NOT. I also purchased other items (71.99 worth of stuff). Most companies will refund cosmetic items without the need to pay return postage (it can&#x27;t be resold and I didn&#x27;t ask for refund on the other items). I ordered this when it was cheaper. All this said, the products also look as if they are made at home (I truly don&#x27;t have guarantee that the product is what it says it is). Well they talked me out of refunding and out of being a customer as well. I feel ripped off. I do not recommend this product. I don&#x27;t trust that it might work if I use it for a year either after three months full strength twice a day and nothing occurred on a very light (hardly noticeable) sun spot. :-(</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Love it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Not too oily, no scent. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks in combination with rosehip oil. My skin seems more even-toned and smoother but not necessarily lighter</li>
    <li> Works great on my black skin, I would definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> I tried this product based on the postive feedback and because it is a natural product. However from my experience the product caused my face to broke out within a day.  Not sure if this was the case because I have sentative skin, either way I am still trying to resolve the breakout condition on my face and neck.</li>
    <li> Ever since I saw this on Dr Oz I wanted to try it and It works exactly what was promised in that show.  I will continue to use this until full results are visible.</li>
    <li> Not working as described. It was supposed to show results within 8-10 days. I&#x27;m not impressed yet. May not work.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money its does nothing. I really do not understand the good reviews.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I put it on with my face lotion every night and the results are wonderful.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. I&#x27;m 30 with a fair complexion but was raised in Florida, so I was covered in uneven-looking spots and freckles on my face and upper chest, and also have a fairly dark melasma spot on my chin that I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of for years. I&#x27;ve been using retin-a, a BHA, a vitamin C and sunscreen for years with good results, but the spot and birthmark were there, just faded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added this to my daytime routine (I&#x27;ve been using it full-strength, oops), and have seen a noticeable improvement in all the areas. The serum also seems to play nice with my many other products. It goes on and leaves a very, very slight moist/oily feel that is more pleasant that it sounds. No scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said I&#x27;ve been using it full strength and I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s recommended (I&#x27;m definitely going to start using it in a diluter as suggested), but I thought I&#x27;d share the results of my accidental experiment.</li>
    <li> seems to be working, the jury&#x27;s still out - jury&#x27;s in it didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Not as effective as advertised, two weeks using pure extract, all day and night,.. and wask face,.. very little improvements in discoloration observed. Dissapointed</li>
    <li> It worked in fading the dark spots on my face.</li>
    <li> It works well.  The dark spots and acne spots have faded.  Be careful not to spill any of the liquid on clothing or there will be discoloration.</li>
    <li> Great product! Really worth buying it</li>
    <li> I saw a difference almost immediately. Not in the least bit disappointed.</li>
