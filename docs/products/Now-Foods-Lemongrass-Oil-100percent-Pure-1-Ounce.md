<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This smells awesome.  I put it in a warm bath.  Or sprinkle alone or with tea tree oil on the sheets.  Smells great. It is a much better value than the tiny vials with a fraction of the content that you can get from massage therapist for the same price.  Potent.</li>
    <li> Hi, I love the product and it is great for cleaning....and other things.&lt;br /&gt;The seller was a bit slow in getting it here but perhaps they were out of stock. It got here lated so not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again only locally.</li>
    <li> Mixing a few drops of this with Tagetes essential oil and water; sprayed on the skin will definitely keep the bugs away. It will also keep the outside cats from spaying a bush outside my door!!!</li>
    <li> love it. arrived on time.Very refreshing..</li>
    <li> It smells so loud. It&#x27;s absolutely wonderful. It smells like fresh lemongrass. You will not regret trying this oil. It lingers in the air nicely which makes it one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> Clean, crisp smell.  Diffusing now and VERY pleased!</li>
    <li> My husband loves his bananas.  I HATE those pesky fruit flies that seem all too common!  I thought it was &amp;#34;just us&amp;#34; until I finally opened up to our friends - and found out they also have the same pesky issues from time to time.  Yes, we&#x27;ve all tried the &amp;#34;lids of apple cider vinegar&amp;#34; to no avail, what now?  I picked up the 1500 ml diffuser humidifier and this bottle of Lemongrass, installed 12 drops of lemon grass, filled the tank with 1300 ml of warm water. I&#x27;ve been diffusing a couple tanks a week, more when the pests make their presence known. The pesky flying critters have all but vanished.  Even our cob web forming spiders seem to have taken a hiatus from our home!  In between sessions of diffusing lemongrass, since it&#x27;s the holidays some days I&#x27;m diffusing peppermint as well which is also known for deterring these pesky pests.. plus is a grand mouse deterrent. Either way, our home smells lovely and we all seem to be calmer since we&#x27;re no longer swatting at pesky &amp;#34;banana gnats&amp;#34;.  Highly recommend!  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again, great value for a 100 % essential oil!</li>
    <li> I was having fruit fly problems. It is summer in Missouri and just a little bit of moisture or just a few fruits left on the counter can make them spawn in hordes. There is nothing I hate more than them. Even more than that I hate pesticides. I am sensitive to them and they are damaging neurotoxins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lemongrass oil in a spray bottle with some water will make them go away, so I read. So, the oil came and I mixed it up. Sprayed it around me house. Besides working, it smelled great! A citrus smell that wasn&#x27;t the typical, tired orange, grapefruit, or lemon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a few drops into my oil burner. It completely covered my shedding dog and cat smell. It penetrated all throughout my 1000 square feet house. Only a few drops is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the rest of the oil line from this brand is this good, then I am buying this brand exclusively.</li>
    <li> Smells like lemon grass</li>
    <li> i love it in soap making</li>
    <li> An excellent product at a fair price delivered right on time. I&#x27;ll certainly use this seller again!</li>
    <li> Too strong. Will not buy it again. I add one drop to other scents.</li>
    <li> Excellent value excellent smell. Don&#x27;t use more than 3 drops for small applications or it&#x27;ll be too powerful. For colognes and perfumes 2 drops is good and for making laundry detergent I use about 10 drops for about 1.6 of a home depot orange bucket.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know this was a two pack! Awesome deal!</li>
    <li> Very strong scent, definitely smells like Lemongrass. I love it!</li>
    <li> Smells great as a cleaning solution..</li>
    <li> I used this as an oil in a homemade bath product and the scent has stayed true after several months.  It&#x27;s a good quality</li>
    <li> I used this product in bait hives for bee swarms. It is a good product, smells very citrus which is what the bees like.</li>
    <li> This was the second essential oil I ever purchased and I love it! I am coming to trust now foods more and more as I add their amazing oils to my collection. The lemongrass oil smells great and has countless uses: great for combination skin, great for homemade shampoo&#x27;s, smells extremely light&amp;fresh -perfect  to add to your oil diffuser-  fights athlete&#x27;s foot, can be applied to the arm pit area for those prone to excessive sweating and it even has the option to be ingested as it boosts your energy! I personally add it to my apple cider vinegar toner, along with a few drops of lavander oil and I definitely see the difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Now is my favorite EO brand!!</li>
    <li> This lemongrass scent reminds me of Pledge wood/furniture polish. It&#x27;s lemony, but not a bright crisp fresh lemon scent. I prefer the reguar lemon scent.</li>
    <li> Now Foods Lemongrass Oil 100% Pure, The Lemongrass Oil  was great...  i use it in my soap making for the first time.</li>
    <li> Strong smelling oil and good quality. I have tried lots of other oils but this seems to be the best at fragrancing the room.</li>
    <li> It was what I suspected.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely oil.  It smells wonderful diffused and I use it combined with Birch, Geranium and fractionated coconut oil for arthritis pain relief.</li>
    <li> Great price and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> Wife loved it.  She used it in her organic soap recipe and the soaps smell fantastic.  Very strong smell and definitely a wake up soap.</li>
    <li> Love this for disinfecting and cleaning. I mix it with water in a spray bottle. Leaves my house looking and smelling fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use the oils for many DIY projects.</li>
    <li> Just so delightful.  I grew up in a place where there were fields of lemon grass and lemongrass tea was a staple morning drink.  Now that I live thousands of miles away in another country, there&#x27;s nothing like this scent to make me feel at home.  Plus, I recently learned that it deters mosquitoes---boy, I hope that&#x27;s true.</li>
    <li> Fast Delivery..and it smell wonderful..I can&#x27;t wait to use this on my massage clients</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It makes my house smell so good. It is very pleasing. Will order more.</li>
    <li> I love this mixed with the juniper oil. On its own it&#x27;s a bit too sweet smelling for my taste. I wish I could find a nice lime or mint oil because that would be an amazing combination! This also works wonderfully with a bit of citronella as a natural mosquito repellant. I set it on the porch and it keeps all the summer bugs away!&lt;br /&gt;Overall the oil is incredibly strong as well. I only needed 5 drops in my diffuser for the scent to fill about 500 square feet. I&#x27;ve purchased numerous other oils from Now Foods and they have yet to disappoint. They&#x27;re all strong, high quality, and they show up very carefully packed and in perfect condition. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> nice product, I love the smell and shipping was easy; thinking about buying more of the essential oils; not too much to say otherwise.</li>
    <li> Came fast after ordering. The oil is concentrated and smells like lemons. I use this in my home made dog shampoo to help keep insects away. I mix Dawn dish soap 2 parts to 1 part Neem oil . To that I add a few drops of  lemongrass, , Citronella, Peppermint, Lavender, and Tree tree oil. My dogs are tick, flea and mosquito free. No need for poisons like Frontline or Advantix. Dogs fur is  shiny, soft, and smells good all the time. I shampoo at least  once a week. Will order again when I run out</li>
    <li> Such a good smell. You only need a few drops to get max results. I have used it in hair products for a fresh perk up and a few drops in bathroom bowl for fresh smell. Gotta like lemon though.</li>
    <li> Awesome oil - used it to make lotion bars and the fragrance really held up through the process.</li>
    <li> You will not be disappointed with Now Foods Brand of essential oils. Priced fairly and great quality oil, don&#x27;t be fooled into paying higher prices for competitors oils.</li>
    <li> I am a major fan of Lemongrass oil, not only for it wonderful scent but also it is a natural insect repellent which is wonderful for someone like me who loves working in the yard and plants a small vegetable garden each spring.  I purchase unscented hand and body lotion and add a few drops of the Lemongrass oil to it.  This is a very powerful fragrance so it takes very little to add the fragrance to anything that you choose.  Also a very pleasant fragrance to add to candles or any type of air freshener.</li>
    <li> Not all essential oils smell the same, and this one is very pleasant.</li>
    <li> This lemongrass oil from NOW is wonderful. I use it in my laundry, in homemade skin care and bug repellent products, and air fresheners... the list is endless. I love NOW oils. They always smell genuine and strong as an essential oil should, and they always come in a generous size for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this scent and it&#x27;s had great staying power in my soaps and other beauty products.  I&#x27;ll be buying it again!</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of the scent, my fiance loves it. I know that a matter of taste but its a little to sweet for lemongrass scent that I enjoy.</li>
    <li> Love this oil.  I make up my own handsoap for the kitchen sink area.</li>
    <li> Several drops of this in a solution of witch hazel and maybe a couple drops of apple cider (and perhaps some citronella oil) makes the best, cheapest, and less toxic method for insect spray. Unfortunately my poor Doberman pup is allergic to the monthly chemical tubes used for flea/tick/chigger repellent, but Lemongrass oil in Witch Hazel not only smells AWESOME, but it also leaves his coat shiny and healthy looking. The smell can be a bit overwhelming to dogs sensitive sense of smell, so I advise spraying them only on their body, and never above the neck. It worked so well for him that i ended up spraying my clothing with the spray when working outside and all insects fled in my wake. I even sprayed the floors and my bed as well. The smell is more refreshing and longer lasting than incense or cologne. I wouldn&#x27;t advise wearing it out to a club, but it&#x27;s definitely a cheap alternative to buying the same crap from supermarkets and moronic and outlandishly priced organic stores. With one bottle of this (+citronella and Tea Tree Oil) my dogs coat remains glossy and silky, and he&#x27;s pest free. During the summer, I actually would spray him before we went for walks and he would be a mobile fly repellent. Highly recommend. Just remember there&#x27;s a difference between the cheap incense style oils, and pure oils. The pure oils can spoil easily so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend making several gallons of the spray at a time unless you plan on hosing down a horde of livestock.</li>
    <li> Wonderful aroma! Love it!</li>
    <li> So good.....if you like the smell of lemongrass this is the oil for you. Great price, strong true smell and fabulous shipping. I&#x27;ll be back for more.?</li>
    <li> Lemongrass is my favorite smell for my homemade beard oils</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Great for acute pain. Just rub a few drops on the painful spot (not wounds or broken skin) and the pain dissipates quickly.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, fresh &amp; clean.  Fast shipping! Great deal for a package of 2 full size bottles!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for our homemade bug spray, and best price around</li>
    <li> Will not purchase from seller again, as 1 bottle was completely broken, and one didn&#x27;t have a lid screwed on...whole purchase was a waste, as the bottle that wasn&#x27;t broken could have been contaminated.</li>
    <li> Great lure for bees, also put a drop or 2 on your old air fresher ! Would rate this five stars</li>
    <li> We use Lemongrass oil on our border collie as part of the war against fleas--it is AMAZING.  He gets rubbed down all over with it daily--makes him smell like Trix cereal, lol, but it works so well.</li>
    <li> Received timely and was as advertised.</li>
    <li> Good smell and good price w/ two pack.  Shared one with my daughter.  She will use for thyroid. I have used for my bug spray.</li>
    <li> I use it as a bee lure and it works really well.</li>
    <li> This is one of the better products by NOW, been using for years and makes a real difference compared to other like products. The price and service from Amazon makes it an easy choice.  I&#x27;ve used it as part of a insect repellent recipe and just love the fragrance it adds to the mix too. Recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> We use it at our B&amp;B for keeping compost bins sweet smelling.  It is such a clean natural scent and keeps our work area clean and fresh smelling - a kind of aroma therapy for the cook, guests, and housekeeper.</li>
    <li> Compared to the Kis Oils 100% therapeutic grade lemongrass, this smells bad! I put it in my mist diffuser and stopped it within minutes because the smell made me nauseous. This is by far inferior to that brand... So now I have 2 large bottles that smell awful and will only serve to scent the garbage bag I throw them into. Very sensitive nose I guess.</li>
    <li> Nice smell when used as a spray.  Read somewhere about mixing with water and using as a spray around places that fruit flies may be trying to start their new bumper crop.  It works.  Just spray it around the base of your plants and drains.  Also, if they&#x27;re hanging out around your fruit, spay a little spurt and they stay away.  Its totally natural and will not harm anything.</li>
    <li> Definitely Lemongrass! lol. I like using the Now products because they have a decent price. I&#x27;m still testing the longevity and freshness of this product, though, too.</li>
    <li> Cannot even believe how effective this is for repelling mosquitoes!  And I even got compliments on the nice smell, a little different from all the other bug sprays on the market!  And you only need to dab some on, a little goes a long way.  Now I can pull weeds to my heart&#x27;s content (ha!).</li>
    <li> The oil is lovely but the packaging is terrible. One of my bottles was completely smashed leaking oil everywhere</li>
    <li> Prompt shipping, product as described.</li>
    <li> I received the product very quickly.  Lemongrass smells so clean, so nice, so fresh.  I pit it in a disffuser, the whole house smell so clean.  I use it as flies repellent.  Excellent !</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Product as described.</li>
    <li> I went to Haiti, and used this as a bug repellent.  The off sprays wipes and lotions did not work for me personally, and I got bit up really bad the first night.  The next day I decided to use the lemongrass oil and it worked great for me.  Thank the Lord I had no more bites the rest of my trip.</li>
    <li> Smells relax! awesome! I love it</li>
    <li> Will use this scent to freshen up my home while it&#x27;s closed over the winter.</li>
    <li> I like the smell, but if you&#x27;re going to use it in your hair, USE VERY LITTLE.  It is very strong and can hair you walking around smelling like lemon scented Lysol.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite scent for my oil diffuser.</li>
    <li> Pretty much exactly what it says it is. I&#x27;m satisfied. Accidentally ordered 2 but no big deal. A little doesn&#x27;t go as long of a way as I thought it would though.</li>
    <li> Great product with a great scent.</li>
    <li> Worked well for certain insects but attracted bees</li>
    <li> I use Now essential oils to make cold processed soaps. I have been very happy with all my oils from Now. They smell pretty much the same as essential oils from the more expensive companies. I will continue purchasing Now essential oils for my soaps in the future. I have been happy with the purity, consistency, and fragrance of their essential oils. The lemongrass essential oil has a particularly nice, earthy smell. I use lemongrass oil to make homemade bug repellant, and it&#x27;s an excellent oil!</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on another reviewer who said it worked great for him as a honey bee lure scent and because the price is really good.  The first time I bought LGO from a different company I paid twice what these two bottles cost and got only one bottle of the product in my other purchase.  My first bottle lasted me through two seasons of luring bees, so I expect these two bottles will last me 4 or 5 years.  This brand of LGO smells just like the first bottle I got from another company and the other brand worked good.  I&#x27;m not concerned whether the LGO I use is holistic grade because I just put a drop in boxes out in the woods.</li>
    <li> Lemongrass is great for stress and for fibro pain - smells wonderful - great quality</li>
    <li> I bought this to dilute with water as a natural fruit fly (gnat) killer after reading various internet comments. I was surprised that it actually works very well and makes the house smell like I just dusted (as long as you keep your eyes averted from the furniture). My pugs were not at all bothered by it. Live pugs + dead gnats &#x3D; Happy Home! I would imagine that this has other uses but it did a great job for my needs.</li>
    <li> This smells so good.  I use it in my bath after a long day in the garden &amp; I climb out so relaxed and refreshed.</li>
    <li> Strong lemon/mint essence.  The price is right.  I used mine in homemade lip balm with a few drops of peppermint to complement.  Plain lemon oil has a different scent.  I prefer this.  Family loves it.</li>
    <li> I still have not used it yet.  one of those things I heard was great for the skin so bought it</li>
    <li> Love love love the fragrance as it diffuses</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the lemon grass essential oil. There are many uses and benefits of lemongrass oil in one&#x27;s daily life. I would recommend this product and seller.</li>
    <li> This is my FAVORITE oil.  It smells absolutely fabulous and just makes me happy to use it.  It&#x27;s like lemon, but milder.  It also does not burn my skin if applied directly.</li>
    <li> Been using Now Foods essential oils for years now, they never have an off smell to them, and always do the job they were purchased for well.</li>
    <li> great buy. This product seems all natural for a great price</li>
    <li> The smell of this oil is amazing. I mix it in with my face wash and shampoo for an extra cleanse. It&#x27;s also great as an aromatic in your oil burner.</li>
    <li> I have a spa theme in my bathroom which leamongrass is perfect scent to help uplift and invigorate the scences.  I love aromatherapy.  I have lavender in my bedroom for a calming/relaxed atmosphere.  This is the first time I am buying NOW brand so I will have to update on how I am enjoying it or not.</li>
    <li> Lemon grass makes ALL bugs scram the other way!&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my little Coton de Turler and he is happy, happy, happy!!&lt;br /&gt;The bugs give me a wide birth too!&lt;br /&gt;It makes my whole home smell so good!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> Using as a swarm lure for beekeeping. This is very potent and the smell lasts a couple days even when exposed to air. We will see if I can attract any swarms using this.</li>
    <li> Great for my diffuser.</li>
    <li> I use this for everything from homemade candles to homemade deodorant.  The scent is refreshing and stimulating and I never get tired of it! I also mix it with aloe vera and witch hazel in a spray bottle, for a gentle homemade hand sanitizer.  For deodorant, I mix organic coconut oil, baking soda and a few drops of this, melt in the microwave (to help everything dissolve and mix well), then pour in a jar and let solidify.  I have also rubbed it on bug bites, which seems to help.</li>
    <li> This was a very good purchase. The oil is excellent for swarm lures. Definitely would recommend this to beekeepers everywhere.</li>
    <li> Quick Shipping. I bought this oil to mix with some seaweed. Love the smell it has. Not to powerful. A+++</li>
    <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t like the smell, because it reminded me of lemon Pledge.  I use it in a wax warmer and you can immediately smell it, but it does come off very strong at first.  I eventually got used to it and other people seem to like the smell and always comment on it.</li>
    <li> This essential oil works great.  I add it to a diffuser or candles throughout my home and it not only has a nice clean citrus smell, it gets rid of those pesky spring/summer flying gnats and mosquitos.  Will definitely buy again and again.</li>
    <li> I like that this is food-grade, but I have been using it for diffusion.  Makes the room smell beautiful and uplifting.</li>
    <li> The smell wakes me up.. Is lemony.i mix it with my body cream. I love it.</li>
    <li> Lemongrass is one of my favorite scents.  I am happy with the product except that it gives me a little bit of a headache in the first few minutes after I put a few drops into a diffuser.  I do not have the same problem with the lavender oil.</li>
    <li> Happy with this product</li>
    <li> product arrived timely and intact - smell is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Wonderful scented lemongrass oil. Holds up well in lotions and creams.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the quality.  I&#x27;m a massage therapist and I use a lot of oils.  I will be buying this brand again.</li>
    <li> I typically buy AuraCacia oils, but I adore lemongrass oil and I use it so often that I thought it would be wise to find a cheaper alternative. The Now Foods lemongrass oil came in a 2-pack of 1-oz. bottles (2 oz. total), and I think I paid $11 for it. I used to pay $5 for a a tiny little half-ounce bottle, so I saved a lot by switching to this brand. I have not noticed any difference in scent or effectiveness of the product and I use it every day. I&#x27;m very pleased with it!</li>
    <li> Love it! I bought this after learning how good for you Lemongrass is. I put a couple of drops in coconut oil and use it on my skin, I&#x27;ve cooked with it, I&#x27;ve put it in a diffuser. It&#x27;s held up well.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite essential oils. It is great mixed with patchouli essential oil  (four drops of each) in my essential oil diffuser. I like to use as combination when I have company over, and guests usually remark on the nice scent. You can buy patchouli  essential oil from the same brand here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product was just as it was expected.  It was shipped faster than expected. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Still trying to attract a bee swarm.</li>
    <li> Smells like pledge wood spray to me.</li>
    <li> Kinda smells like lemon pledge but if you mix it with coconut oil it smells like heaven</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents. No complaints. will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> Potent stuff.  If you like lemongrass you&#x27;ll like this.  I added to diffuser, air freshener even in a homemade deodorant - that turned out to be not such  a good idea since lemongrass can be an irritant on sensitive skin but I can&#x27;t blame the product for that.</li>
    <li> No review needed. Lemongrass essential oil is great with most brands.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this and so do honey bees. It makes a good attractant for catching honey bees.</li>
    <li> not as potent a scent as other brands I have used</li>
    <li> I love using this essential oil for making a body scrub and for soaps I make by hand. I have purchased from this company many times and will continue to give my business to them.</li>
    <li> Great air freshener. I also add it to unscented castile soap to clean my floors.</li>
    <li> Used it against H. Pylori to cure a duodenal ulcer and it worked. I took two drops ten minutes before each meal (breakfast, lunch and dinner, so 6 drops a day).</li>
    <li> IT IS THE BEST I ADD IT TOO MY CLEANING WATER AND THE HOUSE SMELLS LEMONY FRESH</li>
    <li> now brand is a great source of lemongrass. You can benefit from this product. Google the reasons</li>
    <li> Wonderful quality, size, and price. We use it to make our own bug spray.</li>
    <li> Love it, work very good for repelling flies. in my bug spry.</li>
    <li> Read the directions!!  It is the first thing like this I have ever bought.  I put it on my skin and it burned terribly!!  I can&#x27;t say the product is bad but I can say that I need to now what I am doing before I try to use this again!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this in my Cast Iron Dragon steamer on top of my wood stove.  I put 5-10 drops in when I fill up the water and the scent lasts for hours.  Nice clean, crisp Lemongrass scent fills the house.  I&#x27;m sure you can use one of those small Tee light fragrance burners with this also.  (The kind that the large mall store sells where you add water and a drop of scent).&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the 2 pack of 1oz. containers and it should last a long, long time.  It has a plastic cover over the spout so you can only dispense a drop or so at a time.  It would be nice to have a dropper to dispense, but it is not necessary.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected.</li>
    <li> At first I want sure if I liked it, but now this essential oil is one of my favorites. It has a crisp, refreshing lemony scent that I use either in a diffuser, or by putting 15-20 drops in with laundry. The result with either is wonderful, so long as you enjoy the smell.</li>
    <li> This product smells soooo good.  I add this product to other oils to use for my hailr.  It&#x27;s wonderful! Great!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Good packaging. Smells as it should. Very pure.</li>
    <li> It smells like fresh lemons! Yum!! I use this in my homemade cleaning sprays,&lt;br /&gt;As a room freshener, in homemade body scrubs, you name it! This little bottle goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Smells just like pure Lemongrass, I love it!</li>
    <li> Great long lasting scent, high quality product.</li>
    <li> Fast shipped. Very  secure  shipping. Love the product  it is excellent  for diffusing and for lotions. Will purchase  from this seller  again.</li>
    <li> Purchased for Soap Supplies.  Great products</li>
    <li> after extensive comparison of brands, I find NOW essential oils to be just about the best.</li>
    <li> I bought this to attract bees to my new hives. Well, it works better than I could have imagined. I use q-tips to wipe this oil on the inside of my hive and then leave it sitting on top of the brood frames. Add a few drops to your syrup and they will simply devour it like you have never seen before. These 2 bottles will last me for several years.</li>
    <li> Great delivery.  I have purchased before.  I use it in a self made blend to relieve any kind of muscle or joint.  Put in bath water.  Lots of used.  I make up roll on bottle and give to anyone in pain.  Lemongrass, basil and peppermint, half essential oils and half fractionated coconut oil(FCO).  FCO apsorbes into the skin faster and cleaner, never oily.</li>
    <li> Lemongrass smells great and great customer service!</li>
    <li> Right product, right price. What more can you say.</li>
    <li> This is a great essential oil. I love the essence when it wafts to my nose. It&#x27;s clarifying, sharp, and invigorating. I usually put a few drops in a running hot bath. Lemongrass is also a natural insect repellent.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this oil. It is the greatest air freshener of all time. Just a few drops on a rug or wherever last for hours and smells so fresh! I also use it when I make fabric softener. I use about 32 oz. vinegar and add 10 or so drops lavender oil and the same of lemongrass, shake it up and use it just like you would fabric softener. The smell is so fresh! You can do the same for an air freshener spray. You can lightly mist the spray on fabric couches, dog beds, rugs, just about anything that needs a little freshening.</li>
