      <li>Skin79 has the best BB creams!</li>
      <li>This BB cream is awesome!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for girls who, like me, are NC15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Undertones:</li>
      <li>Another thing, this smells really great.</li>
      <li>and I dont get burned great to protect from sun.</li>
      <li>If you like citrusy scents, this will be great.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with this BB cream, and the samples gave me tha chance to compare and decide with formula is better for my skin.</li>
      <li>This BB cream has amazing coverage and if I set it with a mattifying powder, it stay on all day and looks great.</li>
      <li>I loved this product.</li>
      <li>Feels good on my skin.</li>
      <li>but I loved the samples and will order from them again</li>
      <li>They looked great, easy to go on, looks like I&#x27;m not wearing makeup!  </li>
      <li>Great seller, product was in original packaging and had the seal of authenticity and has TONS of samples with it!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this BB Cream!  </li>
      <li>I give it 5 stars for very light skinned to fair skinned persons.  </li>
      <li>I read great things about this BB cream (and that the orange bottle is especially good for oily skin and the color is not grey).</li>
      <li>i write honest reviews for everything ive bought.</li>
      <li>I liked the coverage but after a couple hours I was greasy and filmy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s everything one could want in a BB cream if one is very light skinned, needs good SPF (50+ is good and UVA/UVB) and you want full</li>
      <li>But I have been able to use some of those nice TOO</li>
      <li>I have not had this streak on me (have had that problem with MISSHA Perfect Cover when adding more) and the coverage is absolutely flawless, I mean airbrushed flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Ifind that I can pat with a clean ring finger and get good results.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve read many reviews on this BB that say that it&#x27;s \\&quot;too light\\&quot;, \\&quot;not as good as the Hot Pink\\&quot;, \\&quot;too thick\\&quot;, etc., but don&#x27;t pay mind to those people; they bought a BB that is too light for them and aren&#x27;t happy.</li>
      <li>If you use more than 1 layer of this, you will need a finishing/setting powder, which Skin79 does sell.</li>
      <li>so it felt more like makeup.</li>
      <li>and this one does have slightly more coverage,</li>
      <li>but, it sure didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice neutral light shade.</li>
      <li>This is kinda of chalky and caused more breakouts for me.</li>
      <li>This does have a more pinkish color, which I would have preferred.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I believe it is authentic.</li>
      <li>The color might be ok for those fairer than me, I&#x27;m MAC NC-25 to 30.  </li>
      <li>I have always made sure to wear sunscreen so this combines make up and SPF for me.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t love this product like I wanted to</li>
      <li>I am pretty fair skinned</li>
      <li>Perfect under ANY Korean BB cream, IF you are light skinned enough that the light glow is o.k.</li>
      <li>The SPF is higher, scent is better, and better coverage</li>
      <li>This worked fine.</li>
      <li>I can even use this under my eyes and it does NOT accentuate any fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>I was a bit worried it would be too light for me after reading the reviews.</li>
      <li>Avon Moisture Therapy Hand Cream (yes, on my face...makes it smooth as a babys</li>
      <li>In one step I get my sun protection, extra moisture, and great coverage</li>
      <li>It makes my skin look amazingly smooth.</li>
      <li>I have an olive skin tone but am on the light side.</li>
      <li>I am so thrilled to have my own now, and I definitely understand the hype.  </li>
      <li>if it just weren&#x27;t so darn perfect for us pale people.  </li>
      <li>It IS so perfect for pale people.  </li>
      <li>but it shows my pores and makes it more evident.</li>
      <li>I was so excited when I saw an improvized BB cream to the SKIN79</li>
      <li>I originally bought the sample pack..</li>
      <li>I am extremely fair skinned (I don&#x27;t know for sure, but I suspect a MAC 15-20) and I have very dry skin and</li>
      <li>Those act more like light tinted moisturizers, in my opinion, whereas this BB really does the work it claims to: offer coverage immediately and improve your skin over time.</li>
      <li>Then I apply a small amount of L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect Golden Balm.  </li>
      <li>but I plan to try a different one that is more suitable for severely oily skin.</li>
      <li>I suggest using a separate SPF cream if you are unsure that you are getting full and even coverage or you will not have adequate sun</li>
      <li>Super+</li>
      <li>If your skin is as white as mine (Song Hye Kyo white), you know that everything shows up on your skin so finding the perfect color is super</li>
      <li>My favorite part is the high amount of SPF in the product and that it blocks UVA and UVB</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s suitable for this season since the spf is pretty high.</li>
      <li>I am very fortunate to have mostly clear skin.</li>
      <li>It smells like oranges, clean and crisp.</li>
      <li>A nickle size amount will completely cover most of your face.  </li>
      <li>This BB cream is great for people that are pale.</li>
      <li>Not as good as the Hot Pink?</li>
      <li>Aside from the that, I do like the fact that it&#x27;s SPF 50 and with 1 layer, it did feel super soft and smooth to the touch after maybe 10minutes.</li>
      <li>i typically love anything skin79 and have been brand loyal for several months.</li>
      <li>it is more moisturizing but its more pale.</li>
      <li>I purchased this as my first venture into Korean skincare.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a lovely shade on my skin, and it covers just enough to make me look put together.</li>
      <li>I will definitely buy this again :3</li>
      <li>The ONE Korean BB cream that is really, really full coverage, high SPF AND perfect for REALLY pale skinned persons with very dry skin.  </li>
      <li>First I wash my face with a gentle cleanser or, if not really soiled, just use warm water and a cloth.  </li>
      <li>It does have a little smell to it, but it&#x27;s nothing super strong or unbearable, and it goes away quickly.</li>
      <li>I have to apply everything over a moisturizer and many products STILL just sink into every dry area</li>
      <li>I tried various ways to work on it and still the outcome not as good as Hot Pink BB Cream.  </li>
      <li>and I just can&#x27;t find much that I don&#x27;t like about it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how orange bb would work on really tanned skin.</li>
      <li>was really wanting this to work for me</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way which means it&#x27;s a great value as well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So, in short, I am recommending this for:  Really light skinned persons who require a high SPF, full coverage and those with dry skin.  </li>
      <li>less steps is always better.</li>
      <li>A little will go a long way and it provides a good amount of coverage.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t go for matt looks as they invariably end up looking dry on me, but a fine dusting of transluscent powder will get you completely matt coverage (undertaken in the name of science).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>this Skin79 Super Plus Triple Function BB Vital Cream doesn&#x27;t blend as well as the Hot Pink.  </li>
      <li>you&#x27;re hesitant about all the BB hype in the current American market, I strongly suggest you use this product as it is NOTHING like the L&#x27;Oreal or Maybelline options.  </li>
      <li>I ordered a set of samples of various Skin79 creams and this was my favorite, with the hot pink a close second.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive and reactive, acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s opaque enough to be worn alone without any other liquid makeup on top.</li>
      <li>It has outshone all American BB creams I&#x27;ve tried and has quickly become my daily all in one go to.</li>
      <li>I feel nearly bare-faced in the orange</li>
      <li>However, this made my pores look really visible and it looked like I have a lot of white spots on my nose!!!</li>
      <li>It applies like a medium- to full-coverage foundation and only requires a nickel-sized amount for your whole face (and a bit under your chin for blending sake.)  </li>
      <li>The BB Vital Cream does as others posted.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month, twice a week, and it had never given me a breakout so far.</li>
      <li>wait 30 seconds...and then Skin79 Triple Functions Vital BB Cream.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is kinda of chalky and caused more breakouts for me. I also used it on my chest area and broke out in a rash. Rash went away when I discontinued the product.</li>
    <li> They looked great, easy to go on, looks like I&#x27;m not wearing makeup!  But, I did break out.  Not sure if it&#x27;s caused by the BB cream, but, it sure didn&#x27;t help.  It&#x27;s a love/hate relationship...</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I saw an improvized BB cream to the SKIN79 Super+ Beblesh Balm BB Cream.  Once I received this I rushed to put it on and much to my disappointment this Skin79 Super Plus Triple Function BB Vital Cream doesn&#x27;t blend as well as the Hot Pink.  I tried various ways to work on it and still the outcome not as good as Hot Pink BB Cream.  To make it work for me, I have to mix the Hot Pink and this together.  The texture is also too runny.  The color might be ok for those fairer than me, I&#x27;m MAC NC-25 to 30.  I have oily combination skin.</li>
    <li> My product was not genuine, and resulted in horrible cystic acne on my chin and jaw line. The Skin 79 label and the BB cream label rubbed off with a single touch of my finger. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed and will not order any such product from amazon ever again for fear of being scammed. (My seller was COSTSELL)</li>
    <li> I usually buy the pink label, but I wanted to try this one for a change, and I&#x27;m glad I did. It covers really well, just like the pink label, but I use even less with this one than the pink. One of the pink ones will last me about 6 months, and this one will probably last even longer! It does have a little smell to it, but it&#x27;s nothing super strong or unbearable, and it goes away quickly. Just like with the pink, it makes my skin look radiant and I have absolutely no skin troubles whatsoever. I will definitely buy this again :3</li>
    <li> I am a pretty pale person and this doesn&#x27;t come off dark and orangey like most BB creams that I have found. It&#x27;s a nice neutral light shade. A little will go a long way and it provides a good amount of coverage. it&#x27;s opaque enough to be worn alone without any other liquid makeup on top. I don&#x27;t use any setting powder either and it lasts all day. I&#x27;ve only been using t a few weeks but am noticing the effect it it having on my skin. My freckles and some dark patches I had are already starting to fade.</li>
    <li> I love this! I was a bit worried it would be too light for me after reading the reviews. I originally bought the sample pack.. although this one wasnt in it (so I couldnt test it) I went for it anyway. I have an olive skin tone but am on the light side. This worked fine. Although not all of your face is the exact same tone, for example the forehead tends to be a little bit darker and therefore needs additional blending, but nothing inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as other Skin 79 products I&#x27;ve used. The hot pink doesnt work for me, but the diamond and gold do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read alot about fake products on here. I bought mine from neverprice. I believe it is authentic. It appears to have the same quality as the sample pack I bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not big on wearing make up. I am very fortunate to have mostly clear skin. I have always made sure to wear sunscreen so this combines make up and SPF for me. I love it! less steps is always better. It makes my skin look amazingly smooth.</li>
    <li> I loved this product. I did not find it hard to put on at all. My skin looks so good!!</li>
    <li> Feels good on my skin. I have some dark spots on my face and it covers them and not only that it fades them! I have Lupus and shouldn&#x27;t be out in the sun, but with this I put it on and go to the beach and I dont get burned great to protect from sun. It adjust to your skin color.</li>
    <li> i write honest reviews for everything ive bought. i typically love anything skin79 and have been brand loyal for several months. in this instance the seller Asian Glamour (Kagandahan) sent me a completely empty bottle. when i contacted the seller: i was accused of lying, denied a replacement, and was forced to reorder from different company. yes, i paid twice for the same thing and it is directly the fault of Kagandahan. overall experience was terrible and very frustrating</li>
    <li> Great seller, product was in original packaging and had the seal of authenticity and has TONS of samples with it! Definitely will be purchasing from Costsell again! This BB cream has amazing coverage and if I set it with a mattifying powder, it stay on all day and looks great. Skin79 has the best BB creams!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as my first venture into Korean skincare. It has outshone all American BB creams I&#x27;ve tried and has quickly become my daily all in one go to. In one step I get my sun protection, extra moisture, and great coverage and I&#x27;m out the door and on the way to work in no time. I have very sensitive and reactive, acne prone skin. This did not cause any problems for me. My only complaint is that if not blended well or if you get a little too much you get a slight grey cast to it. A little goes a long way which means it&#x27;s a great value as well. I love this product. I waited 8 weeks to write this review and I just can&#x27;t find much that I don&#x27;t like about it.</li>
    <li> The BB Vital Cream does as others posted. IT makes your skin look ashy or ghostly.&lt;br /&gt;I was really wanting this to work for me</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month, twice a week, and it had never given me a breakout so far. It&#x27;s suitable for this season since the spf is pretty high. I have Skin79 pink bb cream as well. The difference between pink and orange is that pink is natural looking, while orange gives you more coverage. When I say coverage, it applies to people with fair/light skin. I don&#x27;t know how orange bb would work on really tanned skin. If you are tanned, then I recommend the hot pink one, which doesn&#x27;t give you that typical makeup ghostly look</li>
    <li> I read great things about this BB cream (and that the orange bottle is especially good for oily skin and the color is not grey). I am pretty fair skinned but this is too pale even for my skin (I am usually NC 15 to 20).</li>
    <li> Compared to the Pink formula I like the Pink formula more becuz it is more moisturizing but its more pale. I like the Orange since it has color but it shows my pores and makes it more evident.</li>
    <li> This BB cream is awesome! I ordered a set of samples of various Skin79 creams and this was my favorite, with the hot pink a close second. I just found the hot pink to be a little bit thick so it felt more like makeup. I feel nearly bare-faced in the orange, it&#x27;s a lovely shade on my skin, and it covers just enough to make me look put together. It is slightly hard to blend into your skin if it&#x27;s oily (like if you just put on lotion before) but as long as you keep at it a bit, you won&#x27;t see any streaks. I am extremely fair skinned (I don&#x27;t know for sure, but I suspect a MAC 15-20) and I have very dry skin and this BB cream is the one for me!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t love this product like I wanted to but I plan to try a different one that is more suitable for severely oily skin. I liked the coverage but after a couple hours I was greasy and filmy. I kinda noticed my face being alittle itchy too.... Not sure if that was from the bb or cooler weather.</li>
    <li> After using a trial size in the Skin79 BB cream sampler pack, I was hooked.  I am so thrilled to have my own now, and I definitely understand the hype.  It applies like a medium- to full-coverage foundation and only requires a nickel-sized amount for your whole face (and a bit under your chin for blending sake.)  My favorite part is the high amount of SPF in the product and that it blocks UVA and UVB rays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the known amount necessary to \\&quot;make\\&quot; me up, I have a feeling this little bottle will last for a very long time - and the price couldn&#x27;t be beat to go along with that notion.  Don&#x27;t be off put by its claims of \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; because this doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;ll end up with bleached skin, but rather see a fading of freckles, dark spots, and acne marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re hesitant about all the BB hype in the current American market, I strongly suggest you use this product as it is NOTHING like the L&#x27;Oreal or Maybelline options.  Those act more like light tinted moisturizers, in my opinion, whereas this BB really does the work it claims to: offer coverage immediately and improve your skin over time.</li>
    <li> I like it not sure if I will order again but I loved the samples and will order from them again</li>
    <li> This BB cream is great for people that are pale. No, not for people that are darker than an NC 20 so don&#x27;t buy this because it won&#x27;t oxidize to your skin. It&#x27;s great for girls who, like me, are NC15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Undertones: Slightly YELLOW&lt;br /&gt;Coverage: Medium to Full but can look cakey if applied heavily&lt;br /&gt;Texture: Thick, can be somewhat difficult to blend out&lt;br /&gt;Scent: Clean but not overpowering at all&lt;br /&gt;Finish: Slightly dewy, not as shiny/dewy as the Hot Pink BB&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read many reviews on this BB that say that it&#x27;s \\&quot;too light\\&quot;, \\&quot;not as good as the Hot Pink\\&quot;, \\&quot;too thick\\&quot;, etc., but don&#x27;t pay mind to those people; they bought a BB that is too light for them and aren&#x27;t happy. Not as good as the Hot Pink? The SPF is higher, scent is better, and better coverage so, who are you kidding? The Hot Pink is HORRIBLE for pale faces because it shows up grey and makes you look dead! On me, personally, it looked grey when applied and then looked pink. Pink! If your skin is as white as mine (Song Hye Kyo white), you know that everything shows up on your skin so finding the perfect color is super difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it try, pale faces, and you won&#x27;t regret it! ^.^</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used 2 bb creams. 1 is the Skin79 VIP gold collection bb cream and this one does have slightly more coverage, but it&#x27;s still medium like the VIP. However, this made my pores look really visible and it looked like I have a lot of white spots on my nose!!! That is the only reason why I am giving it 2 out of 5 stars. Aside from the that, I do like the fact that it&#x27;s SPF 50 and with 1 layer, it did feel super soft and smooth to the touch after maybe 10minutes. I know it was at least 5 minutes. If you use more than 1 layer of this, you will need a finishing/setting powder, which Skin79 does sell. This is definitely for people who have extremely oily skin. I have combination skin, which the t-zone is oily and the rest can be dry. This made my face everywhere else other than the t-zone SUPER dry that it looked cakey. And my t-zone was the oily opposite. So this is just not for me. Which really sucks, because I did like the high SPF and I thought I might use this for the summer. This does have a more pinkish color, which I would have preferred. Another thing, this smells really great. If you like citrusy scents, this will be great. It smells like oranges, clean and crisp. It&#x27;s not overwhelming either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, I&#x27;m sticking to the VIP gold.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this BB cream, and the samples gave me tha chance to compare and decide with formula is better for my skin. This BB cream  eliminates several steps for me : serum,moisturizer, foundation...I just use this and a blush!!! Done!!!</li>
    <li> HG for me!  I LOVE this BB Cream!  It&#x27;s everything one could want in a BB cream if one is very light skinned, needs good SPF (50+ is good and UVA/UVB) and you want full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gives me absolutely FLAWLESS skin!  It covers every freckle, age spot, any imperfection (how DID I get a scratch in the middle of my forehead, I don&#x27;t even HAVE a cat?) that one could have (yes, I was serious about the mystery scratch).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does NOT make my very dry skin appear dry at all, a real miracle.  I DO have to apply this over a moisturizer.  I have to apply everything over a moisturizer and many products STILL just sink into every dry area (Mt Rushmore face anyone?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my regimen.  First I wash my face with a gentle cleanser or, if not really soiled, just use warm water and a cloth.  Then I apply a small amount of L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect Golden Balm.  Then usually (if not summer, when I am a LITTLE oilier) a small amount of (high glycerin content, same prime ingredient as Algenist at $90) Avon Moisture Therapy Hand Cream (yes, on my face...makes it smooth as a babys butt).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next up MISSHA M BB Boomer. Small amount, nickle size covers face, neck and upper chest. Perfect under ANY Korean BB cream, IF you are light skinned enough that the light glow is o.k. with your skin tone.  Works with mine.  Completely eliminates any imperfections, any pores that are enlarged (both cheeks right by my nose), blurs other imperfections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now wait 30 seconds...and then Skin79 Triple Functions Vital BB Cream.  You only need a LITTLE bit.  A nickle size amount will completely cover most of your face.  Dot to each side of nose, on chin and on forehead and blend out and up.  I can even use this under my eyes and it does NOT accentuate any fine lines and wrinkles.  An equal amount to ones neck and upper chest area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is buildable if need be.  If you do not get full coverage, wait 30 seconds or so and add small dots and blend evenly.  Ifind that I can pat with a clean ring finger and get good results.  Some people prefer a blending brush (concealer brush).  I have not had this streak on me (have had that problem with MISSHA Perfect Cover when adding more) and the coverage is absolutely flawless, I mean airbrushed flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***A side Note on SPF, you will want a thin but even coverage of this product to your entire face and neck and upper chest (if exposed) if counting on it to cover these areas for SPF.  It has  physical sunblockers titanium Dioxide and Zinc Oxide.  I suggest using a separate SPF cream if you are unsure that you are getting full and even coverage or you will not have adequate sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the result to be slightly dewy, not disco ball only slightly, like fresh and wrinkle free.  I&#x27;ve had a LOT of complements on how &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; my skin looked and how &amp;#34;well rested&amp;#34; I looked (covers those dark circles under eyes) while wearing this.  I&#x27;ve had people who knew me tell me that I looked &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34; (yes, you have to know one well to say that) and want to know what I was doing &amp;#34;different&amp;#34;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that I can use either cream or even powder blushes over this.  That is quite a feat since I had about written off powder blush.  But I have been able to use some of those nice TOO Faced powder blushes in my kits and they do not look dry when wearing this BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t go for matt looks as they invariably end up looking dry on me, but a fine dusting of transluscent powder will get you completely matt coverage (undertaken in the name of science).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to agree with someone who said that she cringes when she sees darker skinned girls sporting this.  Don&#x27;t do it!  I give it 5 stars for very light skinned to fair skinned persons.  It only comes in one shade.  I&#x27;d take a star off for that if it just weren&#x27;t so darn perfect for us pale people.  And that is just it.  It IS so perfect for pale people.  The ONE Korean BB cream that is really, really full coverage, high SPF AND perfect for REALLY pale skinned persons with very dry skin.  Hard to find, so just had to give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in short, I am recommending this for:  Really light skinned persons who require a high SPF, full coverage and those with dry skin.  Caveat, must use a moisturizer with this for very dry skin.  But, unlike some BB creams, DOES work well with a moisturizer under it,</li>
