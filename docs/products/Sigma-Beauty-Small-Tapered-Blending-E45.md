<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you are looking for a makeup brush to finish off your look at the outside corner of your eye this is THE brush. Easy to clean and maintains it&#x27;s shape after a good washing.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful brush for applying eyeshadow to the crease.  Very soft and doesn&#x27;t shed hair.  This and another Sigma blending brush that I ordered at the same time are the first Sigma brushes I&#x27;ve tried, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> My favorite blending brush ever. I love all the Sigma brushes. They have never let me down!</li>
    <li> I just have to stress that you need this brush in your life! I just did a review on the small angle brush from Sigma, and I couldn&#x27;t rave enough about it! This brush has a very pointer tip, which works so well to do a precise crease, and it blends out so nicely! It makes doing precision blending so, so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this brush as well as the small angle and flat kabuki and Sigma threw in an extra blending brush as a gift. I personally think the quality of these brushes is just as good, if not better, than M.A.C&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing my brushes from Sigma forever!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this brush for very long but so far when I have used it I have loved it! It blends beautifully and it makes smokey eyes so easy to do. I was wondering what all the hype was about with these Sigma brushes but now I&#x27;m a happy convert!</li>
    <li> Good and shipping in the time</li>
    <li> This brush was just what I needed and the shape is easy to work with for the outer crease and under the eye.</li>
    <li> It arrived the very next day to my house; this product is soft and very good at what it does ! My first sigma brush and it won&#x27;t be my last</li>
    <li> This is perfect for applying and blending out color in the crease.  Washes well and is not scratchy at all.  I recommend this and the winged eyeliner brush</li>
    <li> Perfect shape for getting in the eye crease. Blends really nicely!</li>
    <li> Does a fine job as crease brush and is small enough for detail work in the outer corner and blends okay. Not as soft as I prefer but it does keep it&#x27;s shape.</li>
    <li> This was my first purchase of a Sigma brush after hearing so much about them on Youtube I had to try them out! I love the price, a little more than drug store brushes but a lot less than MAC or other \\&quot;high end\\&quot; brushes. I think these brushes are a steal based on this brush because it is the highest quality blending brush that I have used and I only spent $9 on it! I will definitely be buying more Sigma brushes!&lt;br /&gt;Check out my review on my blog! [...]</li>
    <li> I was so excited to finally receive my brushes. I ordered the \\&quot;Eye Kit\\&quot; and five additional brushes to have the full set of eye brushes. I ripped the box open to find all the brushes in a cute mesh bag with a drawstring and each brush was in its own little plastic sleeve, none of the bristles has been bent or crumpled at a quick glance. There was a little card that explained to first clean before use soooo I did. No shedding &amp; no dye flowed thur the soapy clear water :o). Once dry I went to apply my shadows with and the brush felt like silk in combination with my eye primer &amp; eye shadows. I got a little more excited and decided to do the foiling technique....OMG!!! FLAWLESS!!! I soon found myself using each and every brush. The brushes are not heavily weighted so they really felt comfortable &amp; easy to control unlike other brushes I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m looking forward to passing the word about Sigma. I recommend these brushed to anyone who is looking for the perfect brushes at a affordable price - the next order will be the face brushes.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday, this is the one brush I&#x27;ve found that works perfectly for applying colors to the crease. I also like the fact that even though the price of the brush was cheap, the quality is that of a more expensive brush.</li>
    <li> Amazing little brush! Ir is so unbelievably soft, the perfect size for working on lower lash line, crease, corners... It puts shades in all the right places with perfection. Also can blend so well!!! My favorite brush so far, LOVE!!!</li>
    <li> The product arrived earlier as expected. the packaging was well packed and the brush was very soft. Helps blend the eyeshadow together , especially at the crease.&lt;br /&gt;I can already tell this brush is a really good blending brush by the quality of it. Worth purchasing again !!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I really needed this brush. I&#x27;ve got plenty of crease brushes that look similar to this brush. But the tapered end of the brush works to smoothly blend out the harsh lines for contouring of the eyes. Love it! I&#x27;d say save on getting this one until you&#x27;re really confident with your eye makeup, beginners could definitely splurge on something else, like the E40.</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this brush for blending shadows, but have found that with the tapered tip, you can use it to highlight your cheekbones, contour with bronzer, etc. It does a great job blending shadows into a soft, beautiful wash of color. Sigma brushes are comparable to MAC brushes but at a much better price! The quality is amazing and I am so glad a friend from You Tube recommended these brushes. I have the Premium Professional Brush Kit, the Sigma Sigmax Set (F80, F82 and F84). The F80 is without doubt the best brush I have ever used to apply liquid foundation! Thank you, Sigma and Amazon, for making these brushes so affordable!!</li>
    <li> This brush is PERFECT for blending and getting beautiful looks. Super soft just like my other Sigma brushes and is a must have in anyone&#x27;s collection!</li>
    <li> Very nice brush. Gets the outer V and defines the crease well.</li>
    <li> A few weeks ago I purchased this Sigma brush along with the Sigma E20 and E55 brushes, and I absolutely love them all. Honestly, they are much better than the equivalent ones from MAC, which I used to swear by, but after buying a flawed MAC 217 I decided to give Sigma brushes a try. I&#x27;m SO glad I did! I prefer the Sigma E45 over MAC 226 because it is softer and easier to work with in the crease than the MAC 226 brush, which I find too fluffy. Therefore I decided to add more Sigma brushes to my brush collection and I purchased the E50 and the E35, which I recieved yesterday. They are perfect! They doesn&#x27;t shed at all. Sigma brushes are often referred to as an inexpensive alternative to MAC brushes. But since I can&#x27;t by Sigma products here in Denmark, I have to purchase them from the US-based Sigma online store, and therefore I have to pay customs - i.e. for me there isn&#x27;t any difference between Mac and Sigma with regard to the price. However, I&#x27;m planning to buy more brushes by Sigma.</li>
    <li> I have always loved Sigma&#x27;s brushes, but I needed a new blending brush. One, it is excellent for smokey eyes, and two, it came a lot sooner than the expected date. Who does not love getting their items delivered earlier?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for some time now and it sheds sooooo bad. I purchased one from the actual Sigma site and have no problems at all.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!!!!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent blending brush.  Not too stiff, not too loose and just the right amout of taper at the end.  Highly recommend, especially for people with deep set eyes.</li>
    <li> Im a novice in makeup application, but this brush makes me feel like an mua. The tapered point is wonderful for deepening the color in the crease is soft to the touch.</li>
    <li> I love Sigma brushes and this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  It does exactly the job it was designed to do.  Don&#x27;t bother with the cheap versions or imitations, go for the Sigma brushes every time.</li>
    <li> this brush is definitely worth the money! Its exactly what i needed, and it picks up the product perfectly and applies beautifully.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Because I dont have such a prominent crease along my eye socket or lid, this brush makes the area more defined. And blending is WAY easier and flawless.</li>
    <li> This brush is excellent, firm enough to blend eyeshadow, i like this more than my mac 217 because the sigma is more firm and its smaller, great for more define blending, like to use for every day make up, thumbs up!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect ! easy to use semi soft brush ! Love it !</li>
    <li> Pinceau de qualité, look très haut de gamme à avoir absolument dans sa trousse à maquillage pour un maquillage parfait.</li>
    <li> I just got my Sigma e45 brush and am in love. I am a MAC brush over but find their brushes often inaccessible due to cost. I stumbled on Sigma and decided to give them a try...I am impressed with the quality of the bristles and how compacted they are in the brush. This is a must have to crease blending. I used it immediately and tried it for application and found it very precise. I am buying another brush today as I am thus far impressed!</li>
    <li> It is okay, and I like its shape, but Mac is softer.</li>
    <li> I see why so many people rave about these brushes.  They are fantastic brushes and the best part is they don&#x27;t shed all over your face.  I will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> I love this brush, I have a very smelly crease area and this just gets right in there and shades soooo wonderfully!!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush, a must have for any collection,</li>
    <li> All Sigma brushes are great. I especially like this one for blending out the crease. It is soft and does what it says!</li>
    <li> enjoyed the product, was received a day early so that&#x27;s always nice haha</li>
    <li> Nice handle length and feel. Slightly pointed tip appears to be keeping its shape with washings. The brush is slightly scratchy on my eyelid, but I assume that if it were too soft it might not blend very well.  Good value. Recommended.</li>
    <li> good product.  Had no issues.  very useful.  What i thought I was getting.  The quality of this product was high.</li>
    <li> This is not a dome shaped brush! Its flat and has sparse bristles. I was expecting a bigger pencil brush for more precise shading. This one is flat. Ill be ordering straight thru sigma from now on. Plus it sheds so who ever sells these thru amazon is terrible! Ill say it again, Terrible! Sigma has great brushes and I feel this one was a fake. &amp;#34;Patent Pending&amp;#34; what a joke. Fake!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush! All of sigma&#x27;s products are amazing! So easy &amp; simple to use, as well as low maintenance... Thank you for all your great products!!!!</li>
    <li> Blending Eye Brush was my favorite of the eye brushes I purchased. It&#x27;s the softest of the brushes and does a good job of blending. I actually found good use of it to apply my darker outer corner color as well. I like to dip it in a bit of color like a black or brown and spin the brush between my fingers on the outer corner of my eye to get a soft but opaque color (then blend out the edges of course).</li>
    <li> Although these brushes are a little more then I wanted to pay, I can completely understand why make-up artist spend more. The quality of this brush far surpasses other brushes I have bought. Also, the brush is so severely tapered I should have no problem applying shadow to the v area of my eye with ease. I am definitely going to buy more Sigma brushes as my budget allows. The packaging was great as well. The only con is the fact that they send their brushes via USPS rather then a private carrier. The shipping can add up quickly and I don&#x27;t get to utilize my Amazon Prime account.</li>
    <li> My wife ordered this on my account and swears it is one of the better beauty products she has ordered.  I asked if she would ever buy it again and she said &amp;#34;hell yea.&amp;#34;  If you have any questions ask and I will ask her.</li>
    <li> Exactly what i was looking for in a crease brush for defining my eyeshadow . The quality of this product was better than i expected highly recommend !</li>
    <li> Now this is a nice brush! i love the way it blends the shadow in my crease! Very soft too!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for this one. All my other sigma brushes are soft but this one feels harsh and it&#x27;s prickly and uneven at the tip so I rarely used it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I ever applied eyeshadow without this brush! No wonder I always looked funny, haha. It&#x27;s a very good quality brush for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I have a hanging eye lid and this helps me get to the area just above my crease so the shadows will blend well.</li>
    <li> This brush works perfect for applying eye shadow to the crease. I&#x27;m new to this line of brushes and bought this brush based on the reviews. I will be purchasing more brushes from this line.</li>
    <li> I have recently been purchasing all new brushes to replace my old ones and I am happy I decided to go with the Sigma brand. The brushes are such great quality and the assortment of different brisstles and sizes makes it great to have so many options to build up your own custom set of brushes. I hope to eventually have every brush they make!</li>
    <li> Just recieved my Sigma E45 and I love it! It is a little pricey but well worth it! It is so soft and blends very well!</li>
    <li> I was going to order the travel kit from the Sigma website, but did not want all the brushes in the set.  When I saw they had them on Amazon individually, I decided to get just the ones I wanted.  I&#x27;m so glad I did! They are as great as everyone says and I love this particular brush for blending my crease eyeshadows on my lids. I got 3 brushes I wanted for way cheaper than buying the set that had brushes I didn&#x27;t want and not all the brushes I wanted.  If that makes sense.  Anyway I&#x27;m happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I may just not know how to use the brush, but I definitely don&#x27;t reach for it, EVER. Seems legit though</li>
    <li> I recently bought this product because it was from Sigma, a company which I love, and I also needed another blending brush. When I received it I was very puzzled, because it looked exactly like the sold out MAC 220 brush. I then decided to try out the brush, and was even more surprised to find out that it worked just as well as my MAC 220 brush. Did I mention that this brush is  half the price of that brush! Super excited to find a dupe for that brush! It was my favorite from the MAC line and I was super sad when they took it off the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An overview of the brush is that it is a medium sized blending brush. It picks up the eyeshadow very gently without wasting any, if you use it for applying color. When blending colors it works very well, evenly blending everything; including contrasting colors. It does this job without the dreaded over blending, and can even make cheap drugstore brands look good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I most certainly recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> Perfect  size for small eyes or monolid crease defining. I use it daily to blend my taupe into my crease. And I have a very thin crease so I try to create one on my lid.</li>
    <li> My favorite crease brush!!</li>
    <li> I really wish I had found this brush sooner! I own all the Real Techniques brushes. They all wash well (no dyes running out) and dry super quick. They are good quality, never shed and are (in my opinion) great investments. I have a petite face so it&#x27;s not easy finding makeup brushes that can accommodate my features. This is the only crease brush (aside from the MAC 117) that fits right into the area I want with no hassle. If I could afford them, I&#x27;d order 4 more of these brushes- they&#x27;re that good.</li>
    <li> 5 stars all the way-&lt;br /&gt;Great for blending in the crease and outer V, works fantastic-!&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this brush-</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome! its slight tip makes it easy to work product into the crease and it blends really well. You can use it to apply eyeshadow on the lid too. Must have.</li>
    <li> This brush is awful! It&#x27;s shedding like crazy, it&#x27;s got very poor shape with hairs of all different length sticking out, and several stiff hairs that scratch when I tried to use it to blend. This can&#x27;t be a real Sigma brush. It can&#x27;t be.</li>
    <li> I started to use these brushes about 6 months ago, but this one is my favorite.  It&#x27;s great for contouring around the nose and for eyeshadow.  Must buy!</li>
    <li> This brush blends very well. It fits perfectly in he crease of the eye and the bristles are very soft.</li>
    <li> This E45 brush is uh-mazing! It allows precise color placement and if it is your thing, an easy cut crease. The brush feels extremely well made and the package was fantastic, especially since this is my first Sigma product. I will certainly purchase more Sigma brushes to come!</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It gets right in my crease and it&#x27;s great for easy blending! Very pleased. Love sigma brushes</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how they shipped this brush, but it came in the package UNWRAPPED. It was literally just in there not covered by plastic or anything. The hairs were all messed up, some even at a perfect 90 degree angle to the handle. I understand that different sellers ship their products differently, but this was outrageous. I&#x27;m writing this review to warn people about how this brush is shipped.</li>
    <li> This brush is exactly what I needed to put eye shadow into the crease and it applies really nicely. The brush itself is really soft and has a tapered point to where its perfect for highlighting the inner corner of your eyes. As for the texture of it on your eyelids, it sort of feels a bit scratchy on mines but that&#x27;s probably because mine are a bit more sensitive. Overall great addition to my collection, I will be using it often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update: Okay so i&#x27;m up to more than a month later with this brush and nothing is wrong with it, it&#x27;s still good for it&#x27;s uses and it hasn&#x27;t shed on me at all but it&#x27;s just getting to the point where I don&#x27;t like using it because it feels so scratchy on the lids!! I had a feeling that I wouldn&#x27;t like it once i noticed the itchiness of it at first, but it just didn&#x27;t go away..lol I know i&#x27;m not the only one having this problem but it&#x27;s just not something I like to reach for and itchy bristles are a major no-no for me. I&#x27;ll still use it but ehh..</li>
    <li> This is an awesome brush for blending on hooded eyes. I mainly use it to blend my outer v and it easily softens the look and blends beautifully.</li>
    <li> Finally purchased this blending brush! I really like it… it&#x27;s maybe a little rough to me, but I don&#x27;t have a ton to compare it to. But it&#x27;s great and makes your eye makeup perfect! I might try the MAC one to see if it&#x27;s softer bristles.</li>
    <li> I have a small eye space and this is perfect for really defining my crease and outer corner&lt;br /&gt;I also find this smaller brush works better for palettes where the eyeshadows are tightly packed, other blending brushes can be too big and pickup other colors if you&#x27;re not too careful&lt;br /&gt;I do have to blend with a bigger brush but this helps me more precisely define where I want to put the color</li>
    <li> I received my Sigma E45 brush quicker than expected, packaging was good and the brush is great quality!  The bristles are very soft and the handle is a good size.  I am very happy with this purchase and will definitely be purchasing more Sigma brushes.  Thank you for providing such a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best blending brush I have used in a long time. I really like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to put a lot of pressure to blend .</li>
    <li> I am new to Sigma after being a MAC fan for many years. I find Sigma brushes to be softer with significantly less hair fall out. This particular brush is quite lovely. It places just the right amount of color in the outer corners of my eyes. It also lends itself nicely to putting color in the crease. You can use the tip to place highlight in the inner corner of the eye. I have even used this brush to apply under eye concealer. Cost suits my budget nicely.</li>
    <li> Does a great job blending . Love the way it feels might get the whole set in the future.&lt;br /&gt;  Batootz</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Sigma Brushes!  They are so soft and long-lasting.  You will not go wrong purchasing your brushes from Sigma:)</li>
    <li> I love this brush shape for crease work and blending but the cut is rough and I get tiny bits of brush hairs and shed hairs on my face when I use it. I keep using it, hoping that the shedding and breakage will stop. It is almost time to give up and toss it.</li>
    <li> i researched brushes and knew exactly what I wanted.  It came down to price and seller.  Everything great, quick shipment, all is well and I thank you!</li>
    <li> I have long searched for a crease brush and at last, I have found the holy grail of them! The Sigma E45 is small and tapered, fitting perfectly in my crease. It blends eyeshadow excellently and is a must to create sultry, smoky eyes. I own other products from Sigma and this is by far my favorite; an essential in any collection</li>
    <li> I love the quality and versatility of this brush! I use it most for shading the outer V of my eyelid or for deepening my crease. I will definitely be buying more Sigma brushes! Thanks!</li>
    <li> The brush does its job and blends well, however I don&#x27;t like the scratchy feeling on my eyelids.  I enjoy Clinique&#x27;s brushes, wich are more expensive.</li>
    <li> Great blending for crease</li>
    <li> Perfect for crease small eyes</li>
    <li> This is a great, high quality brush, just as the rest of the Sigma brushes.</li>
    <li> Maybe I got one that passed through inspection and should NOT have.  One side was visibly cut more than the other.  Very disappointing b/c I had heard so much about this particular brush.  I wonder that if I had ordered it through Sigma, if I would have gotten better quality.  The size of the brush is what I expected ( small and tapered), but it seems like I got one with a hasty cutting job. Like I said, one side was not like the other.  VERY DISAPPOINTING.</li>
    <li> This brush is wonderful for the disappeared, I&#x27;m definitely a fan of the Sigma!!! products best prices in the market</li>
    <li> Great for blending. Must wash before use, otherwise it gets too stiff. Good for crease, not fantastic for blending. I prefer my Sephora, travel kit blending brush for that</li>
    <li> This is my first Sigma brush and it did not disappoint.  I have small hooded eyes so precession application is a must.  I would recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> Blends beautifully but it is scratchy!</li>
    <li> Ahhh just what I needed! Great brush, and gives me a lot of control and precision for application. Seller was excellent! I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush for those who don&#x27;t have to much eye space and don&#x27;t want to over blend with regular blending brushes</li>
    <li> Fabulous blending brush ... I love this brush so much I couldn&#x27;t just have one in my collection I had to have  two!</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush.  I love how pointed the tip is, perfect for getting right in the crease!  The brush is also super soft, does not shed, and picks up just the right amount of product :) I would definately recommend this!</li>
    <li> I like it is smooth it works very well to crease the eyeshades.</li>
    <li> Perfect crease brush for hooded or smaller eyes. Does a beautiful job of smoking out the outter v. So glad I purchased this brush.</li>
    <li> I love this brush so much I purchased 4. I already own 1 &amp; knew I had to have more. It helps blend out your crease color so well. I often used the E40 blending brush &amp; felt that it blended the color out to much but the E45 is a little more precise &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave any harsh lines. Tried buying on Sigma&#x27;s website but they were sold out. Being an addict I knew sigma sells though Amazon &amp; here they are. Perfect!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to use as a crease brush since my MAC 217 is a bit too big for my crease and ends up placing shadow on my lid instead of just my crease.  I&#x27;ve had one Sigma brush before (a lip brush) and really like it, but this is the first eye brush I&#x27;ve bought from them -- and it&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are super soft, and the small size makes it easy to place shadow in your crease and outer V.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also washed it a few times now, and it doesn&#x27;t shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sigma brushes really are great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a brush! So glad I purchased this one!!!! Use it to apply eye shadow to my crease and it works amazingly!!! Awesome brush!!!</li>
    <li> This brush does a wonderful job of applying your darker color shadow in your crease for a blended look. This brush really puts all the work on the brush and all you have to do is gently swipe back and forth with it in your crease until it looks smoothly blended with the other color applied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so sorry but yes I did get it</li>
    <li> I am a person who reads reviews before i buy something and and everyone was absolutly right about this product. I love it and the price was great along with the texture of the brush and the look. Purchased many MAC brushes and these are just as good if not better.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best brush I have used for blending. Gets in where I need it without messing up all the other work I have done!</li>
    <li> This brush is one of the best! There are only a few brushes out there that have no others that are made quite the same and this is one of them. It&#x27;s a very intricately purposefully created brush and has one specific purpose--to get shadow in that crease perfectly. That&#x27;s what the brush was created for, that&#x27;s what it does and there&#x27;s very little room for mistakes with this as it can&#x27;t be used for any other purpose.</li>
    <li> Its really great for defining your crease  I really do enjoy Sigma brushes....awesome!  Cant wait to order some more!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Sigma</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for over a year I love it! It&#x27;s perfect for blending the crease and the outer V. Even after a year the bristles are soft and pick up pigments like a charm. :)</li>
    <li> Perfect crease brush for transitions.  Some other reviews said the brush was rough.  But I find this brush to be super soft.  Totally worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Sigma brushes are awesome!  I&#x27;ll never by MAC ones again!</li>
    <li> OMG!!! Is all i can say. this brush is amazing.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, received promptly and packaged nicely.  Its exactly what I was looking for and everything I had hoped it would be and more.  I&#x27;m something of a brush connoisseur and this brush totally exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> Amazing brush!!!! Applies &amp; blends color sooooooo flawlessly. My first Sigma brush and certainly not my last. Looking to buy the Short Shader and Precision Brushes.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is my new favorite brush. I use it everyday. I definitely recommend it to others who love makeup or even newbies &#x3D;)!</li>
    <li> This brush is sooooooo pretty , the hair is sooooo shiny and pretty and sooooo soft and sooooo pointy......it gets right where you need to be. My 3rd Sigma Brush.....</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because as soon as I got my brush I cleaned them to test them out and I noticed that it was sheding. The brush is really soft. I would recomend these brush for personal use.</li>
    <li> absolutely love this brush, putting eye shadows on just became easier, especially for the crease area. Out of all of my Sigma beauty products, this one is probably one of my favorites. I recommend this to all my makeup fanatics out there. It&#x27;s inexpensive and it works.</li>
    <li> This is my all time blending brush that I reach for first if I need to do some serious blending.  It says this is small, but for me, it&#x27;s one of my biggest blending brushes since my eyes are small.  The brush itself it great.</li>
    <li> it grabs the color and puts it on my lids.  I got this tapered brush thinking since it was tapered, it&#x27;d be more precise w application... not so.</li>
    <li> I love my e35 blending brush.  it&#x27;s way fluffier than this.  This doesn&#x27;t blend out as much as I would like, but overall, it&#x27;s a nice brush for the price!</li>
    <li> Love this sigma brush!</li>
    <li> Love this brush so much! Great for a cut crease and holds onto eyeshadow really well! I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Fabulous brush for your crease area...I&#x27;m hooked on Sigma brushes!!!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite brushes from Sigma. The size is perfect for doing work in the &amp;#34;outer v&amp;#34; of the eye. The brush is great quality and holds up well after washing.</li>
    <li> I love sigma brushes. Excellent quality for the price. I am finding that I am buying more and more sigma brushes, and less and less M.A.C. brushes.</li>
    <li> If your considering buy this brush, don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase. Perfect for crease, blending, etc.. Like better in comparison to the &amp;#34;c&amp;#34; brush or whatever. Might order a second one.</li>
    <li> I used this brush for putting in my brow crease and it works like a charm.  I am totally stuck on Sigma brushes they are of the highest quality.</li>
    <li> I debated over whether or not this was worth the buy. Definitely is! My eye makeup has never looked better. I usually use a fluffy brush to apply crease color, but this has allowed me to add so much more dimension by precision applying darker colors to my crease and outer V.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added to my daily makeup brush routine</li>
    <li> The brush is good, but the packing rewind the shape of the hairs.</li>
    <li> I needed good blending brushes but I can’t afford a 25-35$ for a mac brush. So I asked around and seen that sigma are as good as mac but cheaper so I got the E35,E25 E30 E55 E45 and the E40. They are very good and soft, very easy to use and clean. Shipping was fast and I really like them. The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of 5, when I washed them some of the hair came out. It was the first time I cleaned them.  I don’t know if that’s normal or not. I haven’t tried cleaning them again I’m scared.</li>
    <li> Blending is probably one of THE most important steps in any type of makeup application.  This brush is fantastic!!  It&#x27;s shape is perfect - the bristles (brush part?) are the perfect length, and as the name says, are tapered to a soft point at the top.  This is a great brush for getting your crease color and placement just right.  Nice and sharp, easy to work with, no shedding.</li>
    <li> So i purchased this blending brush for my creasing. It is exceptional and I love it, the package arrived super fast and I washed it tried it out and it does an amazing job. I do have to say tho....in the sigma website this brush costs half what i paid for it. So yes this brush is all the hype but pay less from Sigma.</li>
    <li> MY FAVORITE CREASE BRUSH OF ALL TIME! I could not begin to stress how important it is to use good brushes. This brush blends eyeshadows so beautifully without much effort and time. I really have nothing bad to say about it.</li>
    <li> I use this brush every for my eye shadow! It blends the colors and gives a more softer, finished look.</li>
    <li> too soft, too long,don&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> I like using this to add color to my crease it&#x27;s a good brush but don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s necessary, but works great can&#x27;t complain and delivery was fast I always buy from them they are great.</li>
    <li> Better than Mac Brush and a good price tooooo.</li>
    <li> OMG !!!! i loved this brush. its smooth with extra soft hair. very easy to use. wonderful for blend. Absolutely  its my FAV makeup blending brush ever.</li>
    <li> I bought the E40 at first and I liked it but noticed sometimes I have a hard time because my eyes are too small. So I bought this brush and I swear its great! Really works well with Asian eyes!!!</li>
    <li> Such an amazing product! It doesn&#x27;t shed and it is quite soft.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far.</li>
    <li> This one is high quality, the bristles are soft and do not poke when applied, it is perfect for that corner!! I love it! highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best eyeshadow brushes I&#x27;ve ever used! It totally prefer this over my MAC 217, because it&#x27;s smaller &amp; more tapered. The sigma E45 gives you the perfect crease/contour!</li>
    <li> I think that my brush is a little less tapered/shaped than the pictures. It does still have a point, but less of a conical shape. This is great for blending eyeshadow into the crease and undereye area. It&#x27;s slightly less soft than some other Sigma brushes I&#x27;ve tried, but it&#x27;s not scratchy and hasn&#x27;t shed.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It&#x27;s a wonderful blending brush and perhaps among the best blending brush I have.</li>
    <li> Omg  I want all sigmas brushes, the quality and the precision is perfect, I&#x27;m not a professional makeup artist and applying my shadow with this look so nice !!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent brush. The best brand in the world. You can purchase it with your eyes closed, no questions about it</li>
    <li> love love love it! this brush is amazing. love the way how it feels so soft working on the lid.</li>
    <li> This is my seconed sigma brush, i&#x27;m impressed with this because i bought two sigma&#x27;s  but i find the quality of this is better</li>
    <li> I watched some videos and bought this brush to apply crease color. I use this brush in conjunction with the E25 blending brush. I have to say, they are perfect partners for providing a defined crease. I use them to apply highly pigmented shadow for stage makeup and I didn&#x27;t have to go over multiple times to perfect the color and shape. The brushes laid the color in just the right place and just the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;Sigma makes a high quality brush, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush based off of previous reviews, and I am SO glad that I did just that! I am so pleased with this brush. It really blends my makeup perfectly. And to be honest, this brush is a lot better than my last MAC brush that I replaced this one with.</li>
    <li> I love this small tapered blending brush to blend eyeshadow into the crease. It is high quality and does the job well. I opted for the smaller tapered blending brush over the other large one that Sigma has because I have smaller eyes. It fits into the crease well and works well for me.</li>
    <li> Very soft and grabs a lot of product. Since its tampered its perfect for the crease.</li>
    <li> Really soft but kinda disappointed because right when I took it off the package  hair were coming off and there were  long strands of hair, like it wasn&#x27;t cut right :/</li>
    <li> This brush is great if you are looking to adventure on a more advanced makeup technique. it&#x27;s perfect for you that have issues blending colors.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my crease to make a more defined outer V.  That is about all that this brush is good for though.  It is not a good crease brush if you want a blended crease, because the tip is quite narrow and really concentrates the color where it is applied.</li>
    <li> Prompt shipment! Very nice brush and I will use it a lot. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Came on time and I use this crease brush everyday I love this brand!!!</li>
    <li> Soft brisels, don&#x27;t shed, best brushes you can find, founds this brshes on a makeup tutorial by Camila cohelo. Great products</li>
    <li> This brush is the perfect size for my crease. I love the pointed end for a more precise application. The brush is very soft and the handle feels sturdy. Besides the brush, I really like the brush guide that was in the package. Great product and seller!</li>
    <li> I just fell in love with the Sigma E45. It is a smaller tapered crease brush. It was a bit scratchy at first, but I washed it a few times with Garnier Fructis Daily 2 in 1 shampoo/conditioner and now it is perfect. It is fantastic for targeting the crease and perfectly blending my midtone color.</li>
    <li> Wow !! I&#x27;m impresed with this brush, i&#x27;ve a long time to not buy any sigma brushes, but this one is great, the right size to blend it out !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been intimidated by eye shadows but love makeup.  Recently, I began investing in a few brushes that would help me contour my colors and since I have Asian almond eyes (not hooded) I&#x27;ve always had a hard time using other brushes.  When this one was recommended to me, I compared it with other brands like Sephora and MAC and realized that this brush was not only excellent in terms of price but also quality.  Sigma is really an exceptional brand and I&#x27;m so glad it exists.  It allows you to build up a brush collection at a fraction of the cost without compromising quality.  Their shipping was really quick and the packaging is really professional.  (It comes in these little tubes that protect the brushes from getting misshaped.  I have 10+ sigma brushes now and have to say that I enjoy using them more than my Mac, Laura Mercier, and Sephora (top line synthetic) brushes.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast and packaging was done absolutely fantastic.  The product it self is great quality especially because it comes from sigma, the only difference and the reason why it received a 4 is because the handle is now plastic and not wood.  I like the wooden handle a little bit better just because of the weight it added to the makeup brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like any other sigma brush it blends precisely and flawlessly.  This was a great addition to my collection.  I would repurchase any product from sigma any day.</li>
    <li> Bought as an addition to my collection, definitely nice, bristles firm but not hard at all on the skin.  Maintains shape as well, minimum shedding.</li>
    <li> Very good brush from sigma I like the quality and the shipment came fast and nicely packaged. will be ordering more</li>
    <li> Brush is so soft lets you use less product.  Eye product goes on so smooth and blends well soy brushes.</li>
    <li> I own some MAC brushes but I really didn&#x27;t want to drop hundreds of dollars when I decided to update my brush collection. I started with a couple of Sigma eye brushes, and I&#x27;m quite impressed. I don&#x27;t find them to be QUITE as nice as MAC, but for the price, this is hard to beat. Much better than drugstore brushes for a very similar price. Best of all, each of my brushes came with a small bonus brush! You have to love that kind of customer service!</li>
    <li> Small, soft and easily used to blend eyeshadow. I love it. Sigma is a great quality brush. Comparative to MAC.</li>
