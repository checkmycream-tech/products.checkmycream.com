      <li>It does get hot but its soothing to me.</li>
      <li>first 5 minutes after rubbing it in i was like &amp;#34;hmmm</li>
      <li>First of all it took forever to ship.</li>

      <li>I had to cut my workout short &amp; wash it off, I think It did make me sweat more than normal.</li>
      <li>3 will post how things go so far so good.not trying to be super skinny</li>
      <li>weak, whining people lol its going to burn OOOHHH  </li>
      <li>I think this product really works.</li>

      <li>Barely got anything out</li>
      <li>in order to feel the burn you need to apply a good amount of the cream, thats not good because its a small bottle.</li>
      <li>but after a week of using this hot little tube - rubbing it on during the day and doing house work ect.</li>

<li> I did some research and found out that these types of rubs are proven to show results, there are several studies online that support this and the studies met all the criteria such as double blind, large pool of participants, controls, etc.</li>
<li> but ur skin feels dry if you don&#x27;t.  </li>
<li> but im not patient when i see a way to loose inches ;-p</li>
<li> also I dont use a slimmer wrap.im only using product for fatty areas around my waist and stomach...</li>
<li> I spent all day with a ice pack on where it burned to relief the pain... Will not be re-ordering.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t see a change but will give it another shot over the next few weeks or so.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Did not get any results from it like the other reviews stated. Did have fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Not sure what to tell you about this. My wife got this and she claims it works. I used once and had to run to the shower to remove the cream. I guess men are weak! :-) that&#x27;s why we don&#x27;t give birth! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if you use this and wrap your body in plastic wrap you will definitely feel it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not rub your eyes with your fingers after applying this... it goes without saying but keep it in mind. Wash your hands really well!</li>
    <li> The burn is real but after a while u no longer feel the burn</li>
    <li> this dose get hott but don&#x27;t know if it help with the toning of the belly</li>
    <li> This cream works wonders! Rub it on and wrap yourself in seranwrap , the cream starts the heat up and by the time your done with your work out and pull off the plastic you have all this sweat fall too the floor. Literally a puddle of water. Works great!</li>
    <li> I have use this product and i love it. It works good. I would recommended this product to anyone who want to slim down. Dont forget the plastic wrap to cover up with work even better.😄😄</li>
    <li> it is nice but very hot when you apply it all over your stomach . It&#x27;s okay if you can condole the chili hot.</li>
    <li> When I read &amp;#34;very hot&amp;#34;, I did NOT know what very hot meant but ohmahgah.  It went from i-think-i-need-to-scratch hot to OK I need to turn the fan up and put it straight on my belly to OMG wrap a feeling wet towel on tummy burning to rolling on the cold floor naked. It is hot at the end I thought someone had heat up charcoal and stuck it under my skin. All these feelings under 5 min. don&#x27;t think I could take it often</li>
    <li> A little disappointed! Read the reviews,  gave it a try. All it did was burn my skin, made it really red and I didn&#x27;t sweat AT ALL!! Shoulda bought the Eveline product like I started to...</li>
    <li> They make 2 kinds that we have used, and the Yili Balo Café, seems to work better though, then the Hot.&lt;br /&gt;  This is a great product and you will get results if you keep using it . Best is during the day, as laying down can move some of the stuff in areas you DO NOT WANT HEAT ON!&lt;br /&gt;  We both, my son and I lost about 3&amp;#34; on the tummy area, before we went to Mexico , to lay on the beaches!</li>
    <li> Was a little nervous about this item due to the reviews.Delivery was super fast. And when they say it gets hot boy they really mean it. You have to wait about 15 minutes or so to start to feel it burn.i use it while doing my house chores.rub it on and wrap yourself up with plastic wrap. I did notice my arm are about 1/2 an inch thinner. Next all try it on my legs and tummy.mother of 6 am a size 5 trying to get back to my original size 3 will post how things go so far so good.not trying to be super skinny just want to get my figure back.</li>
    <li> in order to feel the burn you need to apply a good amount of the cream, thats not good because its a small bottle. i used it multiple times twice with the wrap trust me i thought these other reviewers were exaggerating but believe us it burnsssssssssss so much that i could barely move because the more u move the hotter it gets, I didnt sweat nor did i lose inches or weight . dont think i just sat down like a lazy dog, i did exercise but no difference really, im 5 7&#x27; and 150 pounds if that helps...</li>
    <li> Does nothing just burns your skin</li>
    <li> Shouldn&#x27;t even give it one star I was super excited bout this product. When I opened the shipping bag it was damaged and had a huge hole in it. Barely got anything out but when I did get some out to try it to give it a second try. After being so upset nothing was there it burned my skin leaving what looked like a chemical burn within 5 minutes and didn&#x27;t wash off when tried to wash it off in the shower. I spent all day with a ice pack on where it burned to relief the pain... Will not be re-ordering.</li>
    <li> It hasn&#x27;t done a thing for me. First of all it took forever to ship. First usage it tingled a bit. Used it everyday and no apparent results.</li>
    <li> Omg, this stuff will have your ass on fire , I put it on my stomach and almost couldn&#x27;t take it  , I put rubbing alcohol and a cold towel on my stomach  which help it out  I can see it working if you use it continually over time if you can take the Heat Lol 😰</li>
    <li> It got rid of my stretch marks!! And i love the smell but it can be a little strong making me cough a little. It does get hot but its soothing to me.</li>
    <li> ive used this when i over heard another female talking about it at a salon, she was bragging that her body which has given birth to a girl and two boys leaving her with a belly and sagging skin but after a week of using this hot little tube - rubbing it on during the day and doing house work ect. she re- measured and lost 2.5 inches in a week so i went on the net looking for it- ebay is cheaper but its being shipped from china -longer wait but only $3 but im not patient when i see a way to loose inches ;-p so i bought it from amazon- got it in 3 days and started using it OOOOOOCCHHHHH this stuff is hot!!!! first 5 minutes after rubbing it in i was like &amp;#34;hmmm not so bad.. a little warmer&amp;#34; but wait it get WARMER THEN WAMER THEN HOT THEN HOTTER!! to the point i had to pace back in forth and tell myself NOT to rub it off lol after about 30 minutes it does settle down form a burning skin inflammed feeling to a warm tingly feeling so i played with it day one and two then day three tried it with plastic wrap and a sweat band Hollllyyyyyyy IIIIIIISSSHHH!!! this was a whle new type of burn now lol it increased the burnign sensation from a 6 to a 10 in a matter of 2 minutes and i had to put  afan on me the first 20 minutes to reduce the temptation to take this pissing hot cream off but it settled and so far ive been using it going on 9 days and have lost 2.7 inches!! not bad - im goingto order again and amp it up to wearing it entire time at work - at gym and only take off when i get home to shower and relax and hopefully ill have over 5&#x27; down when i re- measure in 2 1/2 weeks - this product works but it not for the.....weak, whining people lol its going to burn OOOHHH  HOLLLLY BALLS ITS GOING TO BURN!! but just try to take it for 20 -30 minutes and it will calm down and start workign its magic!</li>
    <li> Was great loved how if heated up even hours later</li>
    <li> This stuff does get hot! The first time I used It I rubbed it on my stomach &amp; lower back, then covered with saran wrap before putting on the rubber waist slimmer. Make sure you wash your hands thoroughly after applying.Its almost like pepper spray &amp; lingers on your hands &amp; everything you touch I left in on for about 4 hrs then took a shower to wash it off. It was slightly painful &amp; I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.  . I did apply it a second time, this time before working out. I did the same with the saran wrap &amp; rubber waist slimmer &amp; when I started sweating, the heat from the gel was even more intense. I had to cut my workout short &amp; wash it off, I think It did make me sweat more than normal.</li>
    <li> I use this product with plastic wrap and bandage to wrap my stomach.  It becomes VERY hot with more pressure applied.  I swear in just one week I can tell a difference. I&#x27;m excited to keep using this product and see what happens.  I did some research and found out that these types of rubs are proven to show results, there are several studies online that support this and the studies met all the criteria such as double blind, large pool of participants, controls, etc.</li>
    <li> This def works but is no miracle cure for fat or unhealthy eating. Def works with exercise. I wore my belt and used slimming gel on belly for 2 days. Everytime my body temp rose from exercise the cream was tingling and hot. In one day with exercise I lost half of an inch. It is very hot..</li>
    <li> I just purchased this product.&lt;br /&gt;I am a mom of two and I&#x27;m very tiny!&lt;br /&gt;I have extra skin around my navel and want to get it flat!&lt;br /&gt;Will do another review when tube runs out.</li>
    <li> This \\&quot;rub\\&quot; is supposed to give u sensations of heat...well I only felt that once...I dont think your supposed to use lotion with it..but ur skin feels dry if you don&#x27;t.  I dont want to call this item a fraud so mabe ill just finish the tube 1st..also I dont use a slimmer wrap.im only using product for fatty areas around my waist and stomach...the product does make u feel like your doing something. All for now</li>
    <li> I think this product really works. But when it gets on your cloth it turns out awful. You smell like it too. And don&#x27;t ever get it in your eyes!!!!!!!😭</li>
    <li> Great! Product works well. Haven&#x27;t used it for too long but can feel the difference. Would purchase again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This gel right here does not play and I used it with plastic wrap and a workout belt, ooh I tell you this stuff had me on fire but I was steady trying to take it, it got so hot I had to see if I got burned, when I checked my skin was red so don&#x27;t use it with wrap unless you can stand the burn. After you finish rubbing it on wash your hands because I got this stuff in my eyes and had to rinse my eyes out for hours for it to stop burning. I only use it on my thighs and arms for now and I do see a toning effect on me it&#x27;s just that when this stops burning later if you start moving around again it starts burning again I found that out when I got to work and I started moving around It got real hot again but this gel is for soldiers so if your weak for heat then this gel isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
    <li> 👍👍👍it works well, you need to wrap your self with plastic wrap because you do not feel the burn with out it. It gets really hot, so be careful.</li>
    <li> Works really well especially when working out you can feel your belly sweating</li>
    <li> makes you burn, burn! and itch afterwards! well me anyway !</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service and excellent product.  Received on time. Used it today it works excellent! I will post again aftet I use for week or two. Should be great, as the other HOT gel they offer is excellent too!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see a change but will give it another shot over the next few weeks or so. Maybe its not for everyone</li>
