      <li>Still use able though.</li>
      <li>The mirror is an okay size; the brush side, while a bit flimsy, gets the job done.</li>

      <li>Quick.</li>
      <li>It is perfect for those on the move who need quick touch-ups but don&#x27;t want to carry big brushes and a mirror to make that possible.</li>
      <li>Great brush, compact and simple and very affordable.  </li>
      <li>Super compact, Sturdy.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s made of a good strong plastic, the bristles are firm and don&#x27;t bend and it doesn&#x27;t fold up when brushing my hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always carried a folding brush in my bag and they&#x27;ve all been mediocre at best made of cheap plastic, bristles that bent when brushing my hair and would even fold up while brushing.  </li>
      <li>It folds nicely into my bag, and the mirror ends up being a big help for checking hair and makeup.</li>
      <li>This style folds up for the back pocket nicely.</li>
      <li>The product arrived quickly and is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>The price was certainly right as well.</li>
      <li>This fold-up brush with mirror is a great find if you want a small hairbrush for your purse.  </li>
      <li>It was exactly what my husband wanted.</li>
      <li>This brush was exactly what I was looking</li>
      <li>Cheap, little, cute.</li>
      <li>one in my laptop case for traveling with work, one in the car for those windy days and one in the coffee table drawer for those lazy tv moments ;-)  love them all!</li>
      <li>The bristles are tight and you get alot of them, well worth the money I will buy more when these break.</li>
      <li>The folding brush and mirror was even better than I&#x27;d expected.  </li>
      <li>The brush is very compact, and will find discreetly into just about anything.</li>
      <li>Looks like the one I received as part of a Clinique bonus years ago, but much flimsier.</li>
      <li>The prior brush I had lasted me for more than three years of almost daily use.</li>
      <li>and the mirror is of high quality.  </li>
      <li>Love these little brushes for home and travel.  </li>
      <li>but I never would have noticed it and can only smell it if the brush is right under my nose</li>
      <li>Having read concerns about the fuel like odors of other brushes of this style that offered free shipping, I chose this brush.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>it being new still.  </li>
      <li>The bristles are hard plastic, I would prefer them to be a good bit softer and to have bigger knobs at the end of the bristles.  </li>
      <li>As a guy, I like my hair looking decent and combs just don&#x27;t do the same as brushes and brushes keep down the static charge.  </li>
      <li>I had such a hard time finding this model of brush locally, I was happy to see it here on amazon.</li>
      <li>I had the exact same type of brush like this before that lasted over a decade and already miss that one.</li>
      <li>Great little brush to put inside a small purse.</li>
      <li>It really surprised me.</li>
      <li>My old one started losing it&#x27;s teeth.  </li>
      <li>I love this small folding brush/mirror!</li>
      <li>usually if you can find them they are cheap and fall apart.  </li>
      <li>Because it doesn&#x27;t stay open very well when it&#x27;s open---you have to hold it open with a finger</li>
      <li>these three brushes were a good deal, although a bit stiff and hard to push out and then back in.</li>
      <li>Snapped in half the first time I tried to use it.</li>
      <li>Needed a small compact brush for my purse and this is exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>I tossed it right in the trash, complete waste of money as not worth the cost of returning</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Excellent - met all expectations beyond any doubt.</li>
    <li> What o you expect for several dollars. It does the job and fits into my smaller handbags.i am happy I have it.</li>
    <li> Included two of these in a care package I sent to a friend stationed in Afghanistan.  She said they were perfect.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a travel brush. compact. replacing one I had for over 15 years and it broke! (that&#x27;s not gross, we only used it once or twice a year when we travel)</li>
    <li> Having read concerns about the fuel like odors of other brushes of this style that offered free shipping, I chose this brush.&lt;br /&gt;It had no odors and works well.</li>
    <li> Great little brush to put inside a small purse. Folds up very small, and the brush doesn&#x27;t make my hair static-y! Love it.</li>
    <li> Snapped in half the first time I tried to use it. Aweeeesomeeee</li>
    <li> Because it doesn&#x27;t stay open very well when it&#x27;s open---you have to hold it open with a finger or it keeps closing up. Also think it&#x27;s awful that when you order 2 of something so small you have to pay twice the $5 shipping when it doesn&#x27;t cost once that to ship them both.</li>
    <li> Super compact, Sturdy. Great price. I like it. I like the fact that  it has a mirror with it. Easy to carry.</li>
    <li> Great for purse carry.</li>
    <li> i like this brush but the teeth fold in when i brush hard with it but i love the price it was sold at and the fact that&lt;br /&gt;it is portable.</li>
    <li> I love these things.  I&#x27;ve used this style of brush for over 20 years in my purse. Eventually the hinge breaks from abuse and I have to replace them.  This model is neat because the mirror slides out, which is neat for doing your makeup on the go.</li>
    <li> This brush was exactly what I was looking for- I carry it in my purse. I&#x27;m growing my hair out and it gets tangled way easier nowadays, having a brush with me is just so handy!</li>
    <li> one in my laptop case for traveling with work, one in the car for those windy days and one in the coffee table drawer for those lazy tv moments ;-)  love them all! wish we could pick the color that comes though... i hate red, got a red, purple and red :-(</li>
    <li> This folding brush is so much better than I thought it would be.  I&#x27;ve always carried a folding brush in my bag and they&#x27;ve all been mediocre at best made of cheap plastic, bristles that bent when brushing my hair and would even fold up while brushing.  But this folding brush beats them all.  It&#x27;s made of a good strong plastic, the bristles are firm and don&#x27;t bend and it doesn&#x27;t fold up when brushing my hair.  It opens and closes with a firm snap and the mirror is of high quality.  This is the very best folding brush I&#x27;ve ever owned and l love it!  Thank you Denco for a superior product!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter.  Blue wasn&#x27;t really the ideal color!  She&#x27;s fine with the way it brushes her hair.</li>
    <li> The brush is very compact, and will find discreetly into just about anything. For me, the mirror was useless, and the needles on the brush were a little too sharp, but its worth the price. I bought three more!</li>
    <li> Great mini brush for my purse. Cheap, little, cute. And the mirror is an added bonus.</li>
    <li> Smells terrible- I tossed it right in the trash, complete waste of money as not worth the cost of returning</li>
    <li> love these brushes that fold up and also have mirrors. these three brushes were a good deal, although a bit stiff and hard to push out and then back in. assume over time it&#x27;ll get easier.</li>
    <li> This brush collapses when trying to brush my hair.  I would not recommend it for anyone that has thick hair.</li>
    <li> My local CVS, Walgreens and Target don&#x27;t seem to have fold up hair brushes. I typically use a smaller cross body purse so I can&#x27;t just put anything I want in there. This brush fits perfectly and so far has held up well. Yes this is a cheap brush. Yes, it will break. I&#x27;ve already gotten a few months of use out of it and that&#x27;s all I can ask. Still going strong</li>
    <li> I love this small folding brush/mirror! It is perfect for those on the move who need quick touch-ups but don&#x27;t want to carry big brushes and a mirror to make that possible. The prior brush I had lasted me for more than three years of almost daily use. I&#x27;m a big fan!</li>
    <li> Junk.  The bristles retreat into the handle before even completing one stroke through my hair.  Totally unusable.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> In my shave kit all the time.  Had one of these for years before my wife took it.  Compact and works great.</li>
    <li> I got this for my other grandson for him to take to school and keep in his locker. He likes that it is handy to grab to use</li>
    <li> Looks like the one I received as part of a Clinique bonus years ago, but much flimsier.</li>
    <li> Works great and I like the mirror feature</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for and no postage made it even better!</li>
    <li> Nice collapsible brush</li>
    <li> Extremely good procuct. It really surprised me. It is very small and you can detatch the mirror without breaking the whole brush. The bristles are tight and you get alot of them, well worth the money I will buy more when these break. You can&#x27;t expect too much for the price, this is a good start.</li>
    <li> My old one started losing it&#x27;s teeth.  I love this for my purse.</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly and is exactly what I was looking for.  I had read some reviews about the product smelling terribly and yes there is a tiny plastic or gasoline type odor but I never would have noticed it and can only smell it if the brush is right under my nose and I&#x27;m breathing deeply looking for it.  The brush is small, compact and has a mirror.  I could not ask for more.  For $1.50 this is the bargain of the century!</li>
    <li> Been using this decades.  As a guy, I like my hair looking decent and combs just don&#x27;t do the same as brushes and brushes keep down the static charge.  This style folds up for the back pocket nicely.</li>
    <li> The perfect little brush for your purse or travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is helpful for quick makeup touch ups!</li>
    <li> It was exactly what my husband wanted. So glad we found these.  He now has extras. Fit nicely into travel the kit.</li>
    <li> Love these little brushes for home and travel.  Just perfect for short hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel/ purse/ gym bag/ car</li>
    <li> The bristles are hard plastic, I would prefer them to be a good bit softer and to have bigger knobs at the end of the bristles.  It is hard to open and close, which may be due to it being new still.  I had the exact same type of brush like this before that lasted over a decade and already miss that one.</li>
    <li> The brush bristle flop back every time one uses the brush.  It&#x27;s necessary to hold a finger against the back of the bristles to prevent them from folding back.  It&#x27;s not an issue for short travel trips, but this is not the brush for long-term use.  We have a similar folding travel brush that doesn&#x27;t have this flaw.</li>
    <li> Nice brush mirror combo.  I have a small purse (because I only want to carry just what I need) so, this is great room saver (cell phone, wallet, hairbrush).</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this item as it is so convienent to put in pocket or purse. I recommend these brushes for anyone who likes a small brush with a mirror that folds into a compact size.</li>
    <li> I ordered purple and got black.</li>
    <li> Great brush for car or purse.</li>
    <li> Great brush, compact and simple and very affordable.  Search for one here but couldnt find. Will be ordering more soon, thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a few of these over the years from different vendors and they always break at the hinge between the brush and the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, I keep buying them because they fit in my purse, broken or not.</li>
    <li> These folding hair brushes are great for stocking stuffers. When I purchased 8 of them I assumed they would look like the one in the illustration (purple). However several of them turned out to be black which is not a good color for young girls. Very disappointing since color was not mentioned anywhere.</li>
    <li> The folding brush and mirror was even better than I&#x27;d expected.  It was a little larger and much sturdier than other similar ones I&#x27;d purchased in the past at the drug store.  The price was certainly right as well.</li>
    <li> This fold-up brush with mirror is a great find if you want a small hairbrush for your purse.  Because of the way it folds up, the brush is kept clean.  And, of course, it can also easily be washed.  I love these brushes.</li>
    <li> Nice item but ordered 2 to get choice of color and both came black so a bit disappointed.</li>
    <li> usually if you can find them they are cheap and fall apart.  The one&#x27;s I received from amazon is sturdier and great for my purse</li>
    <li> These are akin to the tangle-free brushes and work well on my thin hair.  I have them in my suitcase and car.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised. I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> nice and compact.  Great how it folds nicely and slips into handbag.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I use it all the time and it works beautifully. Prompt service and I will order again. Thank you</li>
    <li> I have owned many of these brushes. Very handy for travel &amp; daily use. Happy that these brushes have remained available.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for! Needed a small compact brush for my purse and this is exactly what I wanted! The only thing I would say is that I got a black brush instead of the purple one shown.</li>
    <li> GREAT for your &#x27;ditty bag&#x27; when you&#x27;re on short notice overseas assignments. Inexpensive. Quick. Neat. [WHAT would the Fuller Brush Man say??!!]. I suggest you &#x27;over-order, to compensate for attrition... as it were.</li>
    <li> I like this model of brush for on-the-go. It folds nicely into my bag, and the mirror ends up being a big help for checking hair and makeup. I had such a hard time finding this model of brush locally, I was happy to see it here on amazon.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Broke after a couple of weeks. Still use able though.</li>
    <li> This combination mirror/brush is good for saving room in my purse. The mirror is an okay size; the brush side, while a bit flimsy, gets the job done. Again, it&#x27;s best attribute is it&#x27;s compact size and that is what I was looking for.</li>
