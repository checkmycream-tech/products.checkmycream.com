      <li>Smells amazing!</li>
      <li>It also smells wonderful and my hair was easy to brush.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It gave good tension to hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I loved the tingle I felt after the shower</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance!  </li>
      <li>Cleans hair ok but does not have that mint zing/cooling effect!</li>
      <li>Love the way it smells and the tingle in my hair!</li>
      <li>It is a phenomenal product!</li>
      <li>I really love the aroma and the tingling feeling that it gives, but this is where the good news ends.</li>
      <li>Really nice conditioner.</li>
      <li>I liked it and the smell was like mint.</li>
      <li>Not life changing but a very good conditioner for my very picky hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Would NOT recommend as a product to use to lengthen the time a keratin therapy will last.&lt;br /&gt;Works OK as a body wash, although it lacks a nice aroma...</li>
      <li>This conditioner is  not bad.. smells good..</li>
      <li>I love mint.</li>
      <li>I purchased this because I love the bottle</li>
      <li>Then I noticed more dandruff.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the smell but it doesn&#x27;t condition my hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does get two stars for smelling great and the packaging, but it doesn&#x27;t really condition my hair</li>
      <li>I am so glad a friend of mine told me aobut it.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the smell of this conditioner.</li>
      <li>Provides the right amount of moisture for my hair and smells really good too.</li>
      <li>The only good thing I can say is that this conditioner smells good.  </li>
      <li>We have used many many brands, this is by far the best and reasonably priced.  </li>
      <li>Smells great, hair is soft and silky and manageable.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Buy this if you want your hair to smell good--but if you want it conditioned, and easy to comb, looking to something else instead.</li>
      <li>I have been using this conditioner paired with the tea tree mint shampoo for about a month and a half and it is wonderful!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a man and wanted a non-hippie (Patchouli) and non-feminine, phosphate free shampoo and conditioner that didn&#x27;t smell like flowers.  </li>
      <li>My hair is more manageable and the product is worth every cent.</li>
      <li>This product is triclosan free.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair as smooth as silk</li>
      <li>I was also looking for a conditioner that I could use while sitting under a heating cap for a good deep conditioning session.</li>
      <li>Very nourishing and refreshing for the hair.</li>
      <li>Not only has it completely ridden my scalp of dandruff, my hair feels silky, clean, and smells amazing!</li>
      <li>So much for cheap being \\&quot;good\\&quot;....</li>
      <li>, it smells fresh and is supposedly healthier for you.  </li>
      <li>Wow, I love this conditioner.</li>
      <li>I can tell a significant difference between everything I used before versus using this product which is pure.</li>
      <li>It also left it full of static, so my hair was sticking up all day.</li>
      <li>the kind of week where you go home, open the freezer, decide everything is too much work to cook, and then just go to sleep without washing your hair or changing out of your work clothes or eating dinner)</li>
      <li>It literally stripped the keratin treatment from my hair, which ironically is WHY i bought this product in the first place.  </li>
      <li>I have used several of these products and this has been one of the better ones I have ordered.  </li>
      <li>Then, after I rinse it out, I think it actually tangles my hair more</li>
      <li>Thats all I can say that is positive.  </li>
      <li>--I spend a good 10 minutes combing tangles out of my hair every time I wash it, which isn&#x27;t usually how I like to spend my mornings.</li>
      <li>It also has a little tingle to it and a nice minty smell.</li>
      <li>, right?), and my hair must have remained super dry because I fight static all day long after using it.  </li>
      <li>I have been doing much research and a suggestion that keeps coming up over and over is to try teatree oil.</li>
      <li>After I had my daughter my hair became very</li>
      <li>so much I ditched my shaving cream and got the coconut conditioner for shaving my legs.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t wash my hair for a whole week and it wasn&#x27;t getting greasy.</li>
      <li>It may work for some people, but the tea tree oil was way too much for my scalp.</li>
      <li>I like the scent, and it has a refreshing feel on scalp due to the mint.  </li>
      <li>We found this (and the shampoo) available on Amazon and discovered that it costs less to have it shipped to us in Naples that we paid in the store for in back in the Grand ol&#x27; US of A.</li>
      <li>I bought this and the shampoo to try a new thing.</li>
      <li>I live in Japan.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Made my hair very soft and silky.</li>
      <li>(it had been a very busy week -</li>
      <li>First of all, I feel like I need to use about 1/5 the bottle each time to actually get it to work through my hair.</li>
      <li>This leaves your hair soft and smooth with out leaving it greasy or weighed down.</li>
      <li>This was a no-brainer, to have the conditioner (and shampoo) shipped to us directly saving</li>
      <li>Keeps my hair soft without getting greasy.</li>
      <li>With the hard,silty water found in Naples, both of our hair was looking interesting to say the least.</li>
      <li>postage was expensive, but that still it was good to buy it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Lasts longer than expected and is of a higher quality: thick and creamy texture, refreshing scent and leaves hair soft with volume and no oily build up.  </li>
      <li>We quickly discovered that along with the beauty of another country comes the missing of certain things that we took for granted back in San Diego, CA.</li>
      <li>I am a serious \\&quot;product junkie\\&quot; and the bottle appearance alone pulled me in&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>I am an African American who is transitioning between straight, relaxed hair to curly, kinkier hair and this product provided nourishment for both textures.</li>
      <li>I feel the hairs breaking because of all these knots, even though I try to be careful, and it really makes me angry.&lt;br</li>
      <li>conditioner itself helps to bring our hair back to its soft and in the case of my wife, silky and flowing hair that we had lost since moving here.</li>
      <li>Normally I use the conditioner only occasionally, but my wife uses it regularly, something about me liking her long flowing hair - go figure.</li>

<li> so I haven&#x27;t tried the shampoo for fear it will be too harsh.</li>
<li> Never thought of changing Shampoos until a few years ago.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like the scent, and it has a refreshing feel on scalp due to the mint.  However, my hair was very difficult to comb/brush afterwards (which shouldn&#x27;t happen with conditioners, right?), and my hair must have remained super dry because I fight static all day long after using it.  I wish it worked for me...</li>
    <li> I am a serious \\&quot;product junkie\\&quot; and the bottle appearance alone pulled me in&#x3D;) I was also looking for a conditioner that I could use while sitting under a heating cap for a good deep conditioning session. This product worked wonders for me! I am an African American who is transitioning between straight, relaxed hair to curly, kinkier hair and this product provided nourishment for both textures. It also has a little tingle to it and a nice minty smell. I will definately purchase it again.</li>
    <li> My go-to shampoo. I have extremely greasy hair and it cleans it beautifully. The smell is wonderful as well.</li>
    <li> The only good thing I can say is that this conditioner smells good.  I really love the aroma and the tingling feeling that it gives, but this is where the good news ends. Even after letting the conditioner stay on my hair under a plastic cap for 30 minutes I had a difficult time combing my hair. My wet hair was so tangled and matted it was coming out in my comb! This is one of the worst conditioners I have ever used! It&#x27;s called \\&quot;hydrating\\&quot; but it left my hair feeling parched and dry. I wish I had used this on one of my days off because my hair looked so brittle that I was embarrassed to go to work. I did not have time to rewash it, so I had to go with it looking awful. It also left it full of static, so my hair was sticking up all day. I wanted to try some of the other products from this brand, but I think I&#x27;ll pass.</li>
    <li> My wife and I recently moved to Naples, Italy. We quickly discovered that along with the beauty of another country comes the missing of certain things that we took for granted back in San Diego, CA. One of those items was a conditioner made by Organnix called their Hydrating Teetree Mint. With the hard,silty water found in Naples, both of our hair was looking interesting to say the least. This conditioner is not available locally. We thought sooner or later that we would find  similar conditioner but never did. We found this (and the shampoo) available on Amazon and discovered that it costs less to have it shipped to us in Naples that we paid in the store for in back in the Grand ol&#x27; US of A. This was a no-brainer, to have the conditioner (and shampoo) shipped to us directly saving money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner itself helps to bring our hair back to its soft and in the case of my wife, silky and flowing hair that we had lost since moving here. Normally I use the conditioner only occasionally, but my wife uses it regularly, something about me liking her long flowing hair - go figure. But in all sincerity, the conditioner (and shanmpoo) makes both of our hair softer and less beat up from the hard water and extreme sun from the Mediterranean.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is wonderful! Made my hair very soft and silky. I have thick curly hair that is usually hard to manage but this conditioner smoothed the curls out. I absolutely love the smell of this conditioner. I love mint. It&#x27;s not overpowering but not to subtle either. I would recommend this conditioner to anyone with dry, thick, curly hair. Very good conditioner.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I love the bottle and it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does get two stars for smelling great and the packaging, but it doesn&#x27;t really condition my hair what-so-ever. I have color-treated, long, coarse hair. First of all, I feel like I need to use about 1/5 the bottle each time to actually get it to work through my hair. Then, after I rinse it out, I think it actually tangles my hair more--I spend a good 10 minutes combing tangles out of my hair every time I wash it, which isn&#x27;t usually how I like to spend my mornings. I feel the hairs breaking because of all these knots, even though I try to be careful, and it really makes me angry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this if you want your hair to smell good--but if you want it conditioned, and easy to comb, looking to something else instead. I prefer Herbal Essences over this for conditioning.</li>
    <li> Mmmmm.  I love this fragrance!  It smells like some luscious dessert, and leaves my hair all silky.</li>
    <li> Love the way it smells and the tingle in my hair! After I had my daughter my hair became very dr. I hoping the product line will help me with my moisture issue</li>
    <li> I have a scalp condition called folliculitis and I have red itchy burning bumps on my scalp. I have been doing much research and a suggestion that keeps coming up over and over is to try teatree oil. I saw this conditioner and decided to try it. After only one use my scalp is not itching or burning at all. I know it won&#x27;t heal what I have but just to have some relief is awesome. It also smells wonderful and my hair was easy to brush. I color my hair so I haven&#x27;t tried the shampoo for fear it will be too harsh.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful. Makes my hair as smooth as silk</li>
    <li> The conditioner in this &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; is very hard to find in retail stores locally. Very nourishing and refreshing for the hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this and the shampoo to try a new thing. I liked it and the smell was like mint.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is  not bad.. smells good.. but It was still hard to comb through my hair after a shower.</li>
    <li> Not life changing but a very good conditioner for my very picky hair. Keeps my hair soft without getting greasy. Smells amazing!</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells great but I felt like it left my hair dry and very difficult to comb through.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair smell like a shamrock shake...will stick with the argon.</li>
    <li> This smelled \\&quot;ok\\&quot;  I guess. Thats all I can say that is positive.  It literally stripped the keratin treatment from my hair, which ironically is WHY i bought this product in the first place.  So much for cheap being \\&quot;good\\&quot;....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would NOT recommend as a product to use to lengthen the time a keratin therapy will last.&lt;br /&gt;Works OK as a body wash, although it lacks a nice aroma...</li>
    <li> I have used several of these products and this has been one of the better ones I have ordered.  This leaves your hair soft and smooth with out leaving it greasy or weighed down.</li>
    <li> I got the wrong scent, think I meant to order citrus teatree, but this one smells awful, my head smells like a mint julep.  can&#x27;t uise, going under the sink.</li>
    <li> Really nice conditioner. I like the shampoo in this scent also. Provides the right amount of moisture for my hair and smells really good too. I will continue to purchase this.</li>
    <li> Smells great, hair is soft and silky and manageable.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I live in Japan.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it from Japan.&lt;br /&gt;The postage was expensive, but that still it was good to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;It is a very good fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;It gave good tension to hair.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> My sons and myself all have eczema/sensitive skin.  This stuff is awesome.  We have used many many brands, this is by far the best and reasonably priced.  Lasts longer than expected and is of a higher quality: thick and creamy texture, refreshing scent and leaves hair soft with volume and no oily build up.  I like this stuff so much I ditched my shaving cream and got the coconut conditioner for shaving my legs.</li>
    <li> Christmas present for someone else.  They were very happy.</li>
    <li> Cleans hair ok but does not have that mint zing/cooling effect!</li>
    <li> I bought this with the matching shampoo in hopes it would act as a hydrating shampoo because I noticed my scalp was getting dry from the winter. I loved the tingle I felt after the shower and it made my hair so silky. But that&#x27;s where the benefits ended. I started noticing my scalp felt very tight in the morning after I used this. Then I noticed more dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still tried it but only using it every other day. Then one day I forgot to wash my hair for a couple of days (it had been a very busy week - the kind of week where you go home, open the freezer, decide everything is too much work to cook, and then just go to sleep without washing your hair or changing out of your work clothes or eating dinner) and I noticed my hair wasn&#x27;t getting greasy at all. I didn&#x27;t wash my hair for a whole week and it wasn&#x27;t getting greasy. This shampoo was stripping the oils from my scalp. Never using it again. It may work for some people, but the tea tree oil was way too much for my scalp.</li>
    <li> Wow, I love this conditioner. It smells so great. It&#x27;s wonderful on my hair. I am so glad a friend of mine told me aobut it. I definitely recommend buying this.</li>
    <li> I have been using this conditioner paired with the tea tree mint shampoo for about a month and a half and it is wonderful! I originally bought it for my terrible dandruff. Not only has it completely ridden my scalp of dandruff, my hair feels silky, clean, and smells amazing! My hair is more manageable and the product is worth every cent. I can tell a significant difference between everything I used before versus using this product which is pure. It is a phenomenal product!</li>
    <li> I love the smell but it doesn&#x27;t condition my hair. I have long, thin, wavy hair and I used this line (shampoo and conditioner) for a few months now and it&#x27;s as if I had never used conditioner. My hair was dry, brittle, and very hard to brush out wet or dry. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Never thought of changing Shampoos until a few years ago.  Switched to this one and now I don&#x27;t have dandruff.  Can be used year round.</li>
    <li> https://youtu.be/bMs35QLmOyw</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a man and wanted a non-hippie (Patchouli) and non-feminine, phosphate free shampoo and conditioner that didn&#x27;t smell like flowers.  I like this stuff, it smells fresh and is supposedly healthier for you.  And it helps save the planet too.</li>
    <li> This product is triclosan free.</li>
    <li> Great product . . . great price!</li>
