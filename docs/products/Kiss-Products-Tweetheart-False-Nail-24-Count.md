### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I have been wearing these in the Tweetheart color for 5 or 6 years now and this works great for me.  </li>
      <li>The color is great but they fall of with in minutes...</li>
      <li>so I painted some nail glue over the adhesive for good measure.  </li>
      <li>These are a gorgeous color.</li>
      <li>Now to be fair</li>
      <li>Hope they make more colors - I&#x27;ve already got 4 or 5 queued for purchase after these lol.</li>
      <li>Very sexy.  </li>
      <li>They appeared to be nice</li>
      <li>Nice deal.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nails peel off without any pain or damage to your own nails.  </li>
      <li>Love, love, love!</li>
      <li>When I met my best friend for lunch the next day, she almost ripped my arm off to look at my &amp;#34;beautiful manicure.&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>This brand is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
      <li>So much better than gel</li>
      <li>Love this color.</li>
      <li>imPress are simply the best!  </li>
      <li>But for a fast manicure they are great, easy to apply and have ample amount of glue on them.</li>
      <li>This one is a nice, bright red.  </li>
      <li>the application and removal were so easy</li>
      <li>These are really wonderful, easy to use, nice and short wish I could find more colors in the short length.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Besides that, I&#x27;ve been sporting fabulous nails worry free all week B-).  </li>
      <li>That didn&#x27;t bother me because they fit and stayed on so well.  </li>
      <li>Love the ease of these things - save so much time!</li>
      <li>think it is important to state that you should take the time to trim and file your nails, use a cuticle remover (Sally Hansen Instant Cuticle Remover is astonishingly good), and prep according to directions.  </li>
      <li>The nice thing is no messy clean up of nail glue or polish.</li>
      <li>The color is bright red and eye-popping!</li>
      <li>it was probably just the lighting but in person they where a really bright shiny blood red</li>
      <li>I found these babies again - and so many more colors than are available locally!  </li>
      <li>Many people said they last 2 weeks which was quite appealing.  </li>
      <li>Very pretty...</li>
      <li>I tried these first and thought any type of press ons would be as secure.  </li>
      <li>The end result can be gorgeous as long as you take the time to fit the nails to your hands first.</li>
      <li>However, they are totally worth the money.  </li>
      <li>They can peel them right off after the shoot IF they want</li>
      <li>right.</li>
      <li>Still, you will have beautiful nails in half the time, at half the expense and without the permanent damage to your own nails and nail beds from acrylics or gels.</li>
      <li>They stay on for two weeks and look natural, and easy to put on.</li>
      <li>This vendor delivered fast!  </li>
      <li>My only caveat is that the top rim of the nails seem to attract and ingrain dirt</li>
      <li>So happy and for the price I can definitely do this long term.  </li>
      <li>then they last better.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s a teeny bit too large.</li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s your first time I highly recommend going on YouTube and watching a tutorial or two just to get the steps</li>
      <li>Too much water to the nail will start to compromise the glue.</li>
      <li>They held up really well.  </li>
      <li>My tip is to get it as absolutely close to the cuticle as you can so that there&#x27;s no gap.</li>
      <li>The thumbs don&#x27;t seems to fit also unless you have tiny thumbs.</li>
      <li>The whole nail is the color shown - it&#x27;s not just a coat of color on the nail.  </li>
      <li>very easily.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Lasted less than a week more like 2 days...still served their purpose though.  </li>
      <li>My favorite is called Blue Cross.</li>
      <li>and it was a little bit of a learning curve before I realized that it&#x27;s actually better to pick a nail</li>
      <li>This is a great shade of red - not firetruck red, just a little subdued to give it an earthy feel.  </li>
      <li>I tried three or four different types of glue press ons after my first time using these.  </li>
      <li>I was ready to call it quits and go back to the nail salon for professional acrylics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>First of all this only last a wee as advertised</li>
      <li>Lasted less than expected but still ok</li>
      <li>Only the little finger and the ring finger nails fit the size of my nails, and I have used plenty of Lee Press On Nails with no problem.</li>
      <li>Convenience-wise, they only take a few minutes to peel and glue once you find the nails that somewhat fit each finger.</li>
      <li>This is such a classy simple solution that doesn&#x27;t damage their nails.</li>
      <li>Tweetheart False Nail, 24 Count is the best fake nails I have ever bought.  </li>

<li> but they did not last as long as stated.</li>
<li> These were great--they stayed on a long time, some even as long as three weeks!</li>
<li> When i opened them up they had a very strong bad smell like gas you put in a car.</li>
<li> These look terrific and do NOT hurt your nail bed the way conventional glue on nails or salon nails do.  </li>
<li> In fact I easily get one and a half weeks of wear out of these before I get bored of them and take them off.</li>
<li> Not one of them glued down properly.</li>
<li> The glue is sort of a stretchy material similar to the little tabs of glue you might find on junk mail.  </li>
<li> These are simply done cheaply with bad glue.</li>
<li> but when I bought them I expected a matte nail on the picture</li>
<li> so be careful.</li>
<li> I want them to last at least a week</li>
<li> and the cost is so little compared.</li>
<li> I stumbled upon these a few years ago at CVS and decided to give them a whirl.  </li>
<li> if....you are dead.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know what they make these nails out of, but  they are very flexible, so when part of my nail gets caught on something I&#x27;m not in blinding pain from the stress of a stiff nail at a bad angle.  </li>
<li> that&#x27;s a teeny bit too small</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t like acrylic or gel nails (not healthy).</li>
<li> I am hard on nails and was bending and tearing these up.</li>
<li> I wash my dishes by hand at least once a day.  </li>
<li> I had a difficult time trying to figure out which size went on which finger, and made a few mistakes, but it didn&#x27;t take away from the effect.  </li>
<li> frustrating - I was having to re-glue and reapply EVERY day at least one or two nails.  </li>
<li> the nails are a bit on the thin side</li>
<li> These are EXTREMELY fake looking nails.</li>
<li> BOY was I wrong.  </li>
<li> Needless to say, we are both hooked and I am still amazed by the amount of compliments I get about my nails.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> When i opened them up they had a very strong bad smell like gas you put in a car.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing these in the Tweetheart color for 5 or 6 years now and this works great for me.  So much better than gel and the cost is so little compared.</li>
    <li> Imagine my surprise while getting a pedicure and my former manicurist took my  hand, looked closely and asked me who was doing my nails.  Hah!  These look terrific and do NOT hurt your nail bed the way conventional glue on nails or salon nails do.  The glue is sort of a stretchy material similar to the little tabs of glue you might find on junk mail.  Nails peel off without any pain or damage to your own nails.  Love, love, love!</li>
    <li> These are really wonderful, easy to use, nice and short wish I could find more colors in the short length. They come with a couple of charms, if you want to put them on and some extra glue patches. Nice deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing the nails are a bit on the thin side so be careful. I am hard on nails and was bending and tearing these up. If you keep them cut short so they don&#x27;t get bent up then they last better. But for a fast manicure they are great, easy to apply and have ample amount of glue on them. Too much water to the nail will start to compromise the glue.</li>
    <li> imPress are simply the best!  Long-lasting (about 10 days for me) and keep hangnails from developing. I don&#x27;t know why, but when I wear these nails, my hands are healthier and happier because hangnails just never seem to develop. I have been using imPress nails for about 2-3 years.</li>
    <li> These are a gorgeous color. Their stickers on the back that you peel off and then stick these to your now. My tip is to get it as absolutely close to the cuticle as you can so that there&#x27;s no gap. I also recommend using a liquid cuticle remover before applying these nails. My favorite is called Blue Cross.The end result can be gorgeous as long as you take the time to fit the nails to your hands first. If it&#x27;s your first time I highly recommend going on YouTube and watching a tutorial or two just to get the steps right. I&#x27;ve tried different packs of these and it was a little bit of a learning curve before I realized that it&#x27;s actually better to pick a nail that&#x27;s a teeny bit too small then I nail that&#x27;s a teeny bit too large. Throw the extras in a Ziploc baggie and keep them in your purse in case one pops off, though that has never happened to me. In fact I easily get one and a half weeks of wear out of these before I get bored of them and take them off. I like that I can just peel them off without having to use acetone remover. I posted a picture of the color, hopefully this helps!</li>
    <li> These are EXTREMELY fake looking nails. Not one of them glued down properly. Only the little finger and the ring finger nails fit the size of my nails, and I have used plenty of Lee Press On Nails with no problem. These are simply done cheaply with bad glue. Convenience-wise, they only take a few minutes to peel and glue once you find the nails that somewhat fit each finger. I do not recommend these.</li>
    <li> I like the nails the application and removal were so easy but when I bought them I expected a matte nail on the picture it was probably just the lighting but in person they where a really bright shiny blood red</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I even bothered to try an alternative type of press on.  I tried these first and thought any type of press ons would be as secure.  BOY was I wrong.  I tried three or four different types of glue press ons after my first time using these.  SO frickin&#x27; frustrating - I was having to re-glue and reapply EVERY day at least one or two nails.  I sanded my nails, bought stronger glue....nothing worked.  I was ready to call it quits and go back to the nail salon for professional acrylics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I found these babies again - and so many more colors than are available locally!  This is a great shade of red - not firetruck red, just a little subdued to give it an earthy feel.  With just the adhesive, these stay on 3 or 4 days minimum.  I want them to last at least a week so I painted some nail glue over the adhesive for good measure.  I don&#x27;t know what they make these nails out of, but  they are very flexible, so when part of my nail gets caught on something I&#x27;m not in blinding pain from the stress of a stiff nail at a bad angle.  The whole nail is the color shown - it&#x27;s not just a coat of color on the nail.  So even when the nail gets scuffed my color is not compromised (shine, yes a bit, but not color).  My only caveat is that the top rim of the nails seem to attract and ingrain dirt very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, I&#x27;ve been sporting fabulous nails worry free all week B-).  So happy and for the price I can definitely do this long term.  You outdid yourself with these adhesive press-ons, Kiss!  Hope they make more colors - I&#x27;ve already got 4 or 5 queued for purchase after these lol.</li>
    <li> Lasted less than a week more like 2 days...still served their purpose though.  Lasted less than expected but still ok</li>
    <li> The color is great but they fall of with in minutes... Not hours, not days... Minutes. luckily I only needed them for an hour or so. The nice thing is no messy clean up of nail glue or polish.</li>
    <li> Amazon&#x27;s picture for this color is incorrect. Tweetheart is actually a deep red. Very pretty... I will be keeping them. Just a warning not to believe that you are ordering a French style manicure.</li>
    <li> I stumbled upon these a few years ago at CVS and decided to give them a whirl.  When I met my best friend for lunch the next day, she almost ripped my arm off to look at my &amp;#34;beautiful manicure.&amp;#34;  Needless to say, we are both hooked and I am still amazed by the amount of compliments I get about my nails.  If only they knew!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is important to state that you should take the time to trim and file your nails, use a cuticle remover (Sally Hansen Instant Cuticle Remover is astonishingly good), and prep according to directions.  Still, you will have beautiful nails in half the time, at half the expense and without the permanent damage to your own nails and nail beds from acrylics or gels.</li>
    <li> Love this color. This vendor delivered fast!  These nails last if you put them on before you go to bed.  I wash my hands constantly since I have &amp;#34;OCD&amp;#34; and sometimes they last sometimes they don&#x27;t!  However, they are totally worth the money.  Don&#x27;t like acrylic or gel nails (not healthy).</li>
    <li> I use this product all the time, and use a different color for each month.  July was the color red, hence the red nails.  These were great--they stayed on a long time, some even as long as three weeks! The color is bright red and eye-popping!</li>
    <li> Love the ease of these things - save so much time!</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before buying these.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  This one is a nice, bright red.  Very sexy.  I had a difficult time trying to figure out which size went on which finger, and made a few mistakes, but it didn&#x27;t take away from the effect.  Many people said they last 2 weeks which was quite appealing.  After one week one of my nails lifted.  That didn&#x27;t bother me because they fit and stayed on so well.  I&#x27;m a nurse so my hands are being washed often and I&#x27;m constantly doing things that put pressure on them.  I wash my dishes by hand at least once a day.  They held up really well.  I will buy these again.</li>
    <li> First of all this only last a wee as advertised if....you are dead. Meaning you do not do a thing. You do not touch water at all. Now to be fair I only needed them for one day. I did not want what happened last year at halloween to happen again which was one of my nails in some kids candy bucket. I bought these to go with a halloween costume. They lasted 1 night and a day before they started peeling off. One by One. Now I don&#x27;t like to lose money one anything so I will be using the rest just because. They appeared to be nice but they did not last as long as stated. Maybe that ws the reason for the star in front of the claim. Also it only came with one prep pad for all 10 of your fingers. The thumbs don&#x27;t seems to fit also unless you have tiny thumbs. Over all....will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Kiss products Tweetheart False Nail, 24 Count is the best fake nails I have ever bought.  They stay on for two weeks and look natural, and easy to put on.</li>
    <li> I shoot models and they often come with unkempt fingers. This is such a classy simple solution that doesn&#x27;t damage their nails. They can peel them right off after the shoot IF they want and I get the polished look I need in the images. This brand is my favorite.</li>
