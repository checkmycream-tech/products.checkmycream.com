      <li>It is never a bad idea to have even a small bottle of this in your home if you have children or older adults as a first aid.  </li>
      <li>I was first introduced to this product when a relative was in the hospital.</li>
      <li>I have low resistance to infection, easily get infections and tear on my skin due to prednisone.</li>
      <li>Works well to clear up skin issues.</li>
      <li>Even after a long, hot day, he says that I smell like water.</li>
      <li>This worked beautifully on my sensitive skin without any dilution.</li>
      <li>After 1 day, my breakouts healed about 50% and were completely gone in about 3 days.</li>
      <li>Considering the other products didn&#x27;t do anything after weeks, I consider it a success and have continued to use but only when necessary.</li>
      <li>Be very careful as it is a very strong soap solution, don&#x27;t leave it on your skin very long, just a few seconds.</li>
      <li>It smells a little funny, probably due to years of using fancy smelling soaps and body washes, but it works very well.</li>
      <li>I battled a breakout for several weeks and my other skincare products weren&#x27;t helping much.</li>
      <li>He uses it in the shower and it seems to help keep his breakouts less intense.</li>

<li> This is my second purchase, but it last for a very, very long time.</li>
<li> Doctor told me to get this for my developmentally disabled child to clear hygienic issues.</li>
<li> I have been using Hibiclens (chlorhexidine) for a long time.</li>

<li> This stuff works wonders with the acne on my back and other area&#x27;s of my body.</li>

<li> It comes with a pump and is a foam soap that can really dry out your skin just for every day use.</li>
<li> Still kinda unhappy that Hibiclens doesn&#x27;t manufacture this with a safety seal automatically as it is a pre-surgery cleanse, antiseptic, and non-contamination would be an important thing to verify.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I plan on using it for my horse when he gets his fungal infections during the wet months</li>
<li> So, I&#x27;m careful to not apply anything else on the breakout area, as I do not want other products to dilute or otherwise interact with Hibiclens&#x27; effectiveness.</li>
<li> So, I use Hibiclens every other day to maintain its effectiveness.</li>
<li> With other cleansers, I would still detect underarm body odor midday</li>
<li> Hibiclens remains active on the skin for up to 24 hours.</li>
<li> Cuts down on our environmental  footprint.</li>
<li> Followed other posters suggestions and used a foam pump which reduces waste.</li>
<li> Plus a pump to avoid waste.</li>
<li> Used it a few times for a few days before surgery.</li>
<li> This stuff is a bit harsh with tons of alcohol.  </li>
<li> Cleared up a pretty ugly case of folliculitis in less than 45 days.</li>
<li> I use prescription Drysol antiperspirant for hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating).  </li>
<li> Unfortunately did not solve the itchy back bump problem</li>
<li> Definitely not appropriate for after tattoo care.</li>
<li> have used this in the past.</li>
<li> I applied Hibiclens and massaged in for approximately one minute before rinsing off.</li>
<li> SECRET ACNE SOLUTION</li>
<li> From time to time I get very nasty boils underneath my under arms, and this is the only soap I use to cleans this type of infection.</li>
<li> Weird, feels unsanitary, but the lack of a safety seal is by design.</li>

    <li> This stuff works wonders with the acne on my back and other area&#x27;s of my body. It kills bacteria which is what causes acne in the first place.It&#x27;s better than any other acne formula I know about!</li>
    <li> Great product with low suds cleansing and easy rinsing. I was first introduced to this product when a relative was in the hospital. I now use it on the disabled adult for whom I care.</li>
    <li> Cleared up a pretty ugly case of folliculitis in less than 45 days. It smells a little funny, probably due to years of using fancy smelling soaps and body washes, but it works very well. Also had to use this prior to a cervical fusion surgery last year so it has multiple uses.</li>
    <li> As described and shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> Great medical soap, works great for fungal infections and for animals with skin problems, dry skin, fungal infections. I plan on using it for my horse when he gets his fungal infections during the wet months</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Good product</li>
    <li> This worked beautifully on my sensitive skin without any dilution. Used for post-op incisions, clearing acne etc... Followed other posters suggestions and used a foam pump which reduces waste. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Works well to clear up skin issues. I don&#x27;t like the smell at all, very hospital like, but that makes sense since it is used in hospitals.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my doctor</li>
    <li> Amazing,cleared up infection within 2 days using 2x a day wonderful...I take showers with this all over my body.Excellent.</li>
    <li> From time to time I get very nasty boils underneath my under arms, and this is the only soap I use to cleans this type of infection. I won&#x27;t be without this cleanser. This is my second purchase, but it last for a very, very long time.</li>
    <li> I have used Hibiclens for over a year to eliminate body odor. The formula is runny, doesn&#x27;t lather, and has the consistency of water. For me, none of this is a con, but just keep this mind before buying. The pump makes it easy to control the runny solution so you don&#x27;t accidently pour too much.  Where to Apply To combat body odor, I use it primarily in two specific areas -- underarms and groin. Both of these areas contain your scent glands (google: apocrine glands). These zones are known for producing the most odor.  Underarms I use prescription Drysol antiperspirant for hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating).  With other cleansers, I would still detect underarm body odor midday or whenever I started sweating.  If I stop using Hibiclens and use regular soap instead, it takes about 48 hours for odor to return. So, I use Hibiclens every other day to maintain its effectiveness. I really have no use for deodorant anymore. If you don&#x27;t have a problem with sweating, you can really replace your deodorant/antiperspirant too.   Private Areas Although it is not recommended to use it in the genital area, I do use it on my groin (avoiding contact to more sensitive areas). No irritation! Keeps me very confident in more intimate situations. My partner always comments on how nice I smell. Even after a long, hot day, he says that I smell like water. I&#x27;ll take that compliment anytime.   Note this will only combat sweaty odors. If you have a fishy or &amp;#34;yeasty&amp;#34; odor, you should really check with your doctor as it could be an infection that could worsen with using Hibiclens.   ********** 4/28/2015 UPDATE: SECRET ACNE SOLUTION **********  Because of its antiseptic properties, I figured I&#x27;d give Hibiclens a whirl as an acne solution. I battled a breakout for several weeks and my other skincare products weren&#x27;t helping much. I applied Hibiclens and massaged in for approximately one minute before rinsing off. I use it as a spot-treatment only and am very careful to not get any into my eyes, mouth, or nose.   Hibiclens remains active on the skin for up to 24 hours. So, I&#x27;m careful to not apply anything else on the breakout area, as I do not want other products to dilute or otherwise interact with Hibiclens&#x27; effectiveness. After 1 day, my breakouts healed about 50% and were completely gone in about 3 days. Considering the other products didn&#x27;t do anything after weeks, I consider it a success and have continued to use but only when necessary.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a bit harsh with tons of alcohol.  It made my skin sting when I used it.  Definitely not appropriate for after tattoo care.</li>
    <li> great for the hands especially if you are doing home health care.</li>
    <li> I have been using Hibiclens (chlorhexidine) for a long time. This is great for skin infections and even acne. It is never a bad idea to have even a small bottle of this in your home if you have children or older adults as a first aid.  It comes with a pump and is a foam soap that can really dry out your skin just for every day use.</li>
    <li> very good antibiotic skin cleanser. Recommended by hospital wound clinic.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this in the past.</li>
    <li> It is nice to be able to locate a larger size of Hibiclens. Plus a pump to avoid waste. Thank you,</li>
    <li> its everything you stated, I will order again</li>
    <li> it was everything they say it is!!!</li>
    <li> We purchased this for our daughters first aid kit for hiking. It works well to clean wounds.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 knee replacements and my Ortho-surgeon ordered me to wash with Hibiclens a week before surgery to make sure the area surrounding the knees are really clean. I also use it to shampoo with as I also have a scalp issue once in a while. Works great on skins conditions and under arms also. Be very careful as it is a very strong soap solution, don&#x27;t leave it on your skin very long, just a few seconds.</li>
    <li> My husband has Hidradenitis suppurativa on his inner thighs. We were recommended this by a dermatologist. He uses it in the shower and it seems to help keep his breakouts less intense. I was unsure if he would like it but he did and asked me to order more. :)&lt;br /&gt;He also uses it on his face and it helps prevent breakouts for him</li>
    <li> I am diabetic and get a rash under my belly flap and on inside my thighs. It is some kind of bacteria and I have had to take antibiotics to cure it. I read that this product has an ingredient that was effective for it. AND it is. I use it every time I shower and haven&#x27;t had an outbreak since. I am on my second bottle.</li>
    <li> This was the answer for my skin and health needs. I have low resistance to infection, easily get infections and tear on my skin due to prednisone. One person said that he was obese and was told this would help with the folds of the skin. Although I am not yet obese, I have gained weight and I sweat a lot on prednisone so this helps with all of the results of those conditions!</li>
    <li> Great value, comes with foaming pump/dispenser which was a big plus.</li>
    <li> does what it is suppose to do !</li>
    <li> Edited: Called the company that makes Hibiclens. They say this product does not have a safety seal. Weird, feels unsanitary, but the lack of a safety seal is by design. I had thought the seller sent an unsealed product. Still kinda unhappy that Hibiclens doesn&#x27;t manufacture this with a safety seal automatically as it is a pre-surgery cleanse, antiseptic, and non-contamination would be an important thing to verify.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;Product came with no safety seal and no pump. (Questions on this listing said it came with a pump.) Sent it back.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended I use this and then everyone in my family started using it. They all come to me asking me to purchase it for them. When I can find the gallon size, I buy that and use it to refill the bottles. Cuts down on our environmental  footprint. Works well for us. Beware, it will turn towels a different color, especially white towels. When washed with bleach, my towels turned a brownish/rust color.</li>
    <li> Bought this to help with cross contamination after contracting a MRSA skin infection in my nose.  Within an hour of using it on my face it cleared up about 80 percent of the acne blemishes I have been struggling with for years, and been using countless products on.  By evening time about 90 percent of my acne is gone!  This stuff is amazing!!</li>
    <li> The best anti-bacterial hand soap available.</li>
    <li> The price was perfect. Used it a few times for a few days before surgery. Happy with this purchase will buy again.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately did not solve the itchy back bump problem</li>
    <li> This is what they use in the hospital as a scrub before patient surgery it kills all kinds of germs really great stuff save yourself some money get the big bottle! If you want the product to come out as a foam your going to have to buy the extra bottle pump  some sell it already with top pump,  I am and obese man and have pressure wounds on my backside  from being in a wheelchair all day sometimes they start to bleed ,,every night I wash them dry then dry really good and then apply  calmoseptine barrier cream to heal and take away pain ,it is the best on the market,do not  waste time on anything else and you can get it right here on Amazon good luck God bless ...</li>
    <li> fast delivery and the product works great  thanks</li>
    <li> Doctor told me to get this for my developmentally disabled child to clear hygienic issues. Works very well. Haven&#x27;t had a break out of any kind since the use of this product. We have it in the shower and by the bathroom and kitchen sink. A lot of times it is on sell at Walgreen&#x27;s cheaper than it is here at Amazon, but either way, we keep it in full supply at the house.</li>
