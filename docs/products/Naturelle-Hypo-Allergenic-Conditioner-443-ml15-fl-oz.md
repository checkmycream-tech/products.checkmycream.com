<li> For me It works by penetrating the hair rather sitting on it, and isn&#x27;t at all heavy.</li>
<li> It does have a faint scent, like something from a natural ingredient (but it isn&#x27;t like a perfume scent).  </li>
<li> I can get the same thing here less expensively.  </li>
<li> I have coarse, thick, curly/wavy hair that has a horrible propensity for frizziness, and I find that this conditioner simply is not intensive enough to get rid of the frizz.</li>
<li> It is hard to find conditioners that are hypoallergenic and work.</li>
<li> I was not happy.</li>
<li> No more itchy scalp!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve reordered several times and will continue doing so. This is a good product, doesn&#x27;t have the chemical soup found in most conditioners, and does the job well.</li>
    <li> I decided on this conditioner because I have extremely sensitive skin. I am prone to hives and general itchiness. and using a natural conditioner seemed like a good idea. I have noticed no scalp issues with this conditioner. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I find that this conditioner does not work well with my hair. I have coarse, thick, curly/wavy hair that has a horrible propensity for frizziness, and I find that this conditioner simply is not intensive enough to get rid of the frizz. My hair does not feel smooth when I work it into my hair; it feels rather like I am using hotel conditioner. I have continued to use it because it works with my scalp, however, I do not think I will try this conditioner again.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find conditioners that are hypoallergenic and work. I used this with the shampoo and not only does it work but I only have to use a little for my long hair. My last conditioner I used to have to use three times as much. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner because I have a sensitive scalp.  I have used this product for a couple of weeks, and my scalp seems to be much happier now.</li>
    <li> I bought the Naturelle Hypo-Allergenic Conditioner and was very satisfied with this product. It isn&#x27;t sticky and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. It removed the tangles I had very quickly and left my hair very silky, smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> Works great for me. I have super sensitive skin and this hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts on my scalp.</li>
    <li> Compatible with my allergies, this conditioner seems to be the only product I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried pretty much all of the hypo-allergenic conditioners I could find. Most didn&#x27;t do a very good job of keeping my hair soft. Some had strong, chemical odors. I was not happy. I happened to find this page on Amazon. I ordered the Naturelle shampoo and conditioner. Both are really great. They do the job, the conditioner keeps my hair soft. Neither has a chemical smell. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I never paid this much for a hair conditioner before, but this one really de-tangles and softens the hair the second it is applied.  The cost was worth it, as my husband and I both use it without any problems with skin sensitivity.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It works better than any of the many conditioners I have tried. My hair cutter uses it on her many clients every day because her hands don&#x27;t itch. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different, but I would say this one is worth a try. For me It works by penetrating the hair rather sitting on it, and isn&#x27;t at all heavy.</li>
    <li> My problem with this product is it doesn&#x27;t detangle well. I have long hair so I need a hypoallergenic product that does the job.</li>
    <li> Great for allergy prone ladies like me.&lt;br /&gt;Most shampoos and conditionser make me itch...but, not this!!</li>
    <li> Most hypo allergenic products fall short in the way they perform but this conditioner is great. Really leaves hair soft and smooth. Will stop my search with this product.</li>
    <li> This conditioner with its shampoo, caused excess hair breakage.  I&#x27;ve had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this line of product for a few years now due to scalp sensitivity.  I used to be able to purchase it at any local Sally&#x27;s but for some reason I can&#x27;t find it there, only through Sally&#x27;s website.  I can get the same thing here less expensively.  So glad to have found it!!!</li>
    <li> I Like this product because it is hypo-allergenic and not just dermatologist tested!&lt;br /&gt;In order for something to be dermatologist tested all they have to do is ask a Dermatologist if they like the product!&lt;br /&gt;Everything in it is actually free and clear,No more itchy scalp!!!</li>
    <li> I use this product and it works very well. It does leave you a little dry but it is overall very good.</li>
    <li> My head doesn&#x27;t itch with this conditioner.  Plus it leaves my long, thick hair soft, shiny and manageable---no tangles or static!  It&#x27;s the best conditioner on the market, in my opinion, and at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I had bought Naturelle Shampoo and loved it. Went searching online for their other products. Saw the conditioner and&lt;br /&gt;purchased that. My pleased with both.</li>
    <li> I have color treated hair with ends that are dry and porous.  After a shampoo, my hair is tangled and feels like straw.  This conditioner does a great job of untangling and moistening the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I use a lot of this product after each shampoo, and I&#x27;ve used it about six times since I bought it -- but there&#x27;s still a lot of product left in the bottle.  My routine is after shampooing hair to apply the conditioner to wet hair, spread it around to all parts of hair, then I leave it on 10 minutes or longer.  I cover it with a shower cap.  Then I rinse it out, but not completely.  I leave a little bit of the conditioner on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it has minimal scent.  It does have a faint scent, like something from a natural ingredient (but it isn&#x27;t like a perfume scent).  The scent goes away during rinse out.  This conditioner doesn&#x27;t cause my allergies to flare up.</li>
