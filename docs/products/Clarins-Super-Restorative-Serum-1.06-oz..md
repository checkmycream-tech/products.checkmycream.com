      <li>i can see that  works right way!  </li>
      <li>You know that glowing look you get after cleansing when you splash your face with cool water?</li>
      <li>at 62, this gives me a very dewy finish with diminished wrinkles and looks fabulous!  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how they deliver for such a good price.</li>
      <li>y face feel better soft, smooth and help me to keep moist</li>

      <li>Buying more next week.</li>
      <li>First of all, let me say I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
      <li>It was sooo much cheaper on amazon, there was such much more clarity in my skin after a week.</li>
      <li>Some are good, most didn&#x27;t have any dramatic effect on my 43 year old skin.</li>
      <li>My skin tone is great after a few weeks of daily application using this product.</li>
      <li>I am very picky about product fragrance and the tactile feeling</li>
      <li>I always laugh when Consumer Reports reports that there is no real point to all this kind of product; their people are not doing it properly!  </li>
      <li>I use it daily under Super Restorative Night Cream and then my foundation makeup and</li>
      <li>It has been a favorite of mine for the last ten years.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the double serum for years, but just turned 60 and decided to try the super restorative serum.  </li>
      <li>High quality ingredients.</li>
      <li>I got a sample of this stuff and was told to use it morning and night under my normal moisturizer.</li>
      <li>This stuff is light and sinks in immediately, plumps up the skin and keeps it that way ALL DAY!</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>For a bit it looks like the young, vibrant skin you had when you were 20?</li>
      <li>wow!  </li>
      <li>and it is definitely old...</li>
      <li>My skin isn&#x27;t overly sensitive, but after a week now I&#x27;ve had no irritation at all.</li>
      <li>and my skin is naturally oily.</li>
      <li>I used for two product rounds with a complete suite of Clarins products and now will be returning to my regular drug store brands.  </li>
      <li>I hightly recommend Clarins serum for those who have dry sensitive skin...</li>

<li> /&gt;it lasts a long time.</li>

<li> Will definitely seek out other Clarins products.</li>
<li> it curdles under my night cream and is a total waste!</li>
<li> Very over rated product and way too expensive as it did nothing for me.  </li>
<li> I even use a little serum under my eyes and it doesn&#x27;t cause puffiness, but smooths out my skin.  </li>
<li> I used this product for few months now.  </li>
<li> I had been using  Clarins products but they are so expensive that I had not bought them for a while.  </li>
<li> No miracles, just the usual minimum base effect.  </li>

    <li> No miracles, just the usual minimum base effect.  I used for two product rounds with a complete suite of Clarins products and now will be returning to my regular drug store brands.  Same results at reduced cost.</li>
    <li> I used this product for few months now.  My skin looks radiant and shinny.  I have a very dry and sensitive skin and need something to moisture my dry skin.  This serum serve the purpose.</li>
    <li> Was as advertised.  Thank You.</li>
    <li> Received the product I ordered, also received prompt email reply to a question concerning the product, arrived quickly - could not ask for any better service - will use them again!</li>
    <li> Great Clarins product!  I would recommend this to anyone.  It is worth the price and&lt;br /&gt;it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I have moved through the stages of Clarins in the last 25 years of use.  Great product.  I am not allergic to it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t imagine what I would do without it. Everyone thinks that I am twenty years younger than I am including my husband.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Lancome&#x27;s serums and Clarins Super Restorative Serum is by far the best on the market! I use it daily under Super Restorative Night Cream and then my foundation makeup and at 62, this gives me a very dewy finish with diminished wrinkles and looks fabulous!  I recently re-ordered this serum and it is definitely old...it curdles under my night cream and is a total waste!</li>
    <li> Love this product and the quick delivery as well!.  It has been a favorite of mine for the last ten years.Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 70s and don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles for my age.  This serum gives my face a healthy glow. I let it soak in twice a day after cleansing and then apply a moisturizer.  I even use a little serum under my eyes and it doesn&#x27;t cause puffiness, but smooths out my skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 7 years and honestly would not want to be without it.</li>
    <li> Very over rated product and way too expensive as it did nothing for me.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This product beats them all! I&#x27;ve used the double serum for years, but just turned 60 and decided to try the super restorative serum.  It is out of this world! Beyond good. I saw an immediate difference and see improvement in my skin every day. Especially in skin tone and firmness.  I also purchased the super restorative night wear. Fabulous!</li>
    <li> It is very good y face feel better soft, smooth and help me to keep moist my skin Clarins are  really a wonderful products.</li>
    <li> This product seems good in theory, but the perfume in all of Clarins products irritated my skin to the max. It gave me eczema under my nose and on my cheeks. I&#x27;ll be giving the line to my mom.</li>
    <li> wow!  i can see that  works right way!  i am 44 e my face looks younger day after day with this serum Maginifico!</li>
    <li> Does nothing.  Better to use prescription Obagi, it&#x27;s worth EVERY penny and it works!!!!</li>
    <li> I had been using  Clarins products but they are so expensive that I had not bought them for a while.  I just ordered them through Amazon.  While I have had good results with other products, these Clarins products that I just bought, Serum, Day Cream, and protective sun screen are the best that I have used.  I think it is a good idea to use them together.  My skin seems more calm and even.

Honestly I know that I have good genes, but because I have always cared for my skin, I look years younger!</li>
    <li> My skin tone is great after a few weeks of daily application using this product. I am very picky about product fragrance and the tactile feeling and it wins an A+ for me. Im 46 and my skin is naturally oily.</li>
    <li> Have used it for years, love it and  all Clarins creams in Resorative line, not to heavy...except the exorbitant prices</li>
    <li> Clarins is a company you can trust in...High quality ingredients. My favorite...goes a long way...gives results.</li>
    <li> It was sooo much cheaper on amazon, there was such much more clarity in my skin after a week. Will definitely seek out other Clarins products.</li>
    <li> I hightly recommend Clarins serum for those who have dry sensitive skin...it will not erase wrinkles but it makes the skin look fresh.</li>
    <li> First of all, let me say I&#x27;ve tried them all. La Mer, Origins, Kiehl&#x27;s, Dr. Perricone. Some are good, most didn&#x27;t have any dramatic effect on my 43 year old skin. I have very dry skin, no deep wrinkles but do have crepey skin under my eyes, and a few bothersome vertical lipstick lines above my upper lip. I got a sample of this stuff and was told to use it morning and night under my normal moisturizer. This stuff is light and sinks in immediately, plumps up the skin and keeps it that way ALL DAY! You know that glowing look you get after cleansing when you splash your face with cool water? For a bit it looks like the young, vibrant skin you had when you were 20? This stuff is like that, but it lasts. I don&#x27;t know what is in it, but this stuff is now in my arsenal. If I could afford it, I&#x27;d bathe in this stuff. My skin isn&#x27;t overly sensitive, but after a week now I&#x27;ve had no irritation at all.</li>
    <li> Best serum on the market!</li>
    <li> Cairns always pulls through. I love their products.</li>
    <li> The best serum I have ever used, and I don&#x27;t know how they deliver for such a good price.</li>
    <li> This fabulous cream has been a staple of my skin care regime for many years now and I can&#x27;t live without it. And Amazon&#x27;s price can&#x27;t be beat. (Nordstrom and Bloomingdales charge $130 for this!)</li>
    <li> Like all Clarin products! They all work well.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful skin product and the seller is good to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41KgHVIVDwL._SS300_.jpg</li>
    <li> Honestly didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin.  May work for someone younger but I think I will just stick with my creams.</li>
    <li> This is an expensive product and I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference yet so i will keep trying it and see what the final verdict is... so far not hugely impressed for such a large pricetag.</li>
    <li> The best serum on the market. One week after using I see a brightness &amp; firmness in my skin. Buying more next week.</li>
