<li> The 4 bottles are mini bottles so you won&#x27;t have them hanging around long if you aren&#x27;t fond of them.  </li>
<li> NOT WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
<li> I priced the polishes, Base and Top Coats, Dryer, Polish Remover, and the cost came out cheaper than all the mani/pedi places I&#x27;ve been to.  </li>
<li> extremely small.</li>
