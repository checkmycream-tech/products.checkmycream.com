      <li>:)</li>
      <li>The cape is fairly sturdy and easy to clean and put away.  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t use the &#x27;thinning&#x27; scissors, but the standard scissors work great!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a clue why they are so many favorable reviews for these scissors.</li>
      <li>works ok, had a sturdier one before</li>
      <li>I can see how many folks may complain about that than the product itself.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>Nice and cheap.  </li>
      <li>Most of the cut hair falls into it.</li>
      <li>However, they look like used, if you want to buy them, please think more.</li>
      <li>The scissors are VERY sturdy and great quality.</li>
      <li>, that mine are much better quality).</li>
      <li>The scissors are nice and sharp, and the cape will be great once my son learns not to play with it!!  </li>
      <li>These are high quality shears and the cape did a great job of keeping the millions of cut baby hairs contained.</li>
      <li>I have pretty good hand and eye coordination</li>
      <li>As far as the shears goes they are great, but the umbrella didn&#x27;t impressed me because it doesn&#x27;t hold the hair the way it was supposed to and also especially when you taking it off the person head.</li>
      <li>User friendly !</li>
      <li>The cape is okay, but made a fairly cheap material.  </li>
      <li>We used the cape on my 22m old, and it worked great.  </li>
      <li>I have used this on my son (3 yrs old) and it works great.  </li>
      <li>The thinning shear is very useful, and I&#x27;m glad it is included.  </li>
      <li>The scissors are sharp and great too!</li>
      <li>They are easy to use.</li>
      <li>so it easily draped over a booster seat and did not stick to skin.  </li>
      <li>and home hair cut easy hands on .</li>
      <li>Good price for 2 high quality scissors.</li>
      <li>In fact, incredibly, it makes cleanup HARER than the normal straight cape that I had originally been using.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to give this product 4 stars instead of five for 1 reason, FIT.</li>
      <li>does not sit right, even when I use clips to make the cape more like a basin/trench.</li>
      <li>Overall: great item and definitely worth the price!</li>
      <li>The &#x27;thinning&#x27; shears are super easy to use - worth every penny!</li>
      <li>Plus it was always a pain to clean up the mess.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had to scrub them to clean them but they do work well for the price.  </li>
      <li>The cut on the hair is clean and not frayed.</li>
      <li>Hair still gets everywhere and it doesn&#x27;t make things easier to clean up.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried it on, which is fine for me because I&#x27;m not cutting tons of hair at a time.  </li>
      <li>but they worked for my fast needs until I get better pair of thinning shears.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The cape itself is also very prone to static cling, so again, hair gets everywhere.</li>
      <li>I recommend for anyone looking for good shears at a low price?</li>
      <li>It catches the hair but if they move it can fall out pretty easy.</li>
      <li>I am not super impressed obviously as they are very cheap shears</li>
      <li>the low price was too good to be true, it is a shame I was proven right in this instance.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re sharp and accurate, I would expect to pay three times this for how good they are.  </li>
      <li>Both of the scissors are great - plenty sharp enough to do trims on my own hair, as well as haircuts on my son and daughter.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t pay someone else to do the first haircut!</li>
      <li>Easy enough :-)</li>
      <li>Great little invention.</li>
      <li>I needed something fast and cheap and got it.</li>
      <li>well worth the price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of like a tiny hoop skirt, which catches the hair as it falls in any direction.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Shipping was Super Fast!</li>
      <li>The thinning shears and flat scissors in this kit are very nice, better quality than I expected.  </li>
      <li>but that goes right out the window when&lt;br /&gt;you try and cut hair.  </li>
      <li>The capes neck hole is very large and I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
      <li>If you just use them for cutting your own family&#x27;s hair from time to time they are great and worth the money.</li>
      <li>Smaller than the old-fashioned pair I was using, they fit my average-size hands well and make it much easier to maneuver safely around temples and ears.  </li>
      <li>Very sharp scissors and good quality.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I needed something fast and cheap and got it. I am not super impressed obviously as they are very cheap shears and I have not really had them long enough to know just how long they will last but they worked for my fast needs until I get better pair of thinning shears.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was Super Fast!</li>
    <li> Nice and cheap.  Good for home use.</li>
    <li> The scissors are great. I like them a lot. The cape is great for my husband and kids but I wish it was a little longer/wider. It catches the hair but if they move it can fall out pretty easy. Overall, I feel it helps make less of a mess and I love that!</li>
    <li> I loved the cape on this product! It&#x27;s very unique and not what I expected. It&#x27;s like a mini pop up tent that doesn&#x27;t allow the hair to fall on the child.  It is perfect for a young toddler! The scissors are sharp and great too!</li>
    <li> It is a good tool for haircut.</li>
    <li> The scissors are very dull. I can&#x27;t even use them because it pulls the hair when I am cutting. They are very heavy duty but the blades are not sharp enough.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a newbie just wanting to save&lt;br /&gt;Money by cutting my 5 girls hair-I bought these for less than the price of one haircut and they work perfectly!</li>
    <li> Works great when cutting my two grand son&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;I still have a little hair to clean up , but nothing like before I started using the Hairstyling cape.&lt;br /&gt;The shears that came with the cape made the package a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;Pastor in Detroit</li>
    <li> honestly i was expecting something better. the cape is..weird..and the shears dont cut, yet smell like motor oil ugh oh well too late</li>
    <li> The scissors are smaller than I expected.  The cape is okay, but made a fairly cheap material.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This item arrived the next day after I placed my order - I am very happy with it, very easy to use and the cape keeps clean-up so much easier! The shears are very sharp so be very careful. The &#x27;thinning&#x27; shears are super easy to use - worth every penny! I&#x27;ll be using these for a very long time and will be saving quite a few (our local kiddie haircut place charges 20 dollars each time plus tip!)</li>
    <li> delivered on time. both are sharp enough. I don&#x27;t like the cape.. it&#x27;s not useful. Using these for my little girl&#x27;s hair cutting and satisfied over all.</li>
    <li> Both shears came looking dirty and greasy.  There was a black film on the inside of both shears.  I had to scrub them to clean them but they do work well for the price.  The capes neck hole is very large and I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat these shears for the money.  They&#x27;re sharp and accurate, I would expect to pay three times this for how good they are.  The thinning shears are a great tool for shaping a hair style.  The cape is also handy for minimizing cleanup.</li>
    <li> The scissors and texturizer sharp.  They cut  and not chop the hair.  The cut on the hair is clean and not frayed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my husband&#x27;s hair for over 6 years.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item for the cape because my mother-in-law has one with a similar concept. She had me cut his hair on a visit as he was getting shaggy and hers worked quite well. So, I looked for one for my home. After trying to use this on my 2yo and my husband SEVERAL times each, I&#x27;ve concluded that if I could give this zero stars, I would. I just get aggravated every time I&#x27;ve used it.&lt;br /&gt;It does not sit right, even when I use clips to make the cape more like a basin/trench. Hair still gets everywhere and it doesn&#x27;t make things easier to clean up. In fact, incredibly, it makes cleanup HARER than the normal straight cape that I had originally been using. The cape itself is also very prone to static cling, so again, hair gets everywhere. Trying to shake the hair off the cape just makes it stick to both sides of the cape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t tried the scissors, since I have my own set already (which, I&#x27;m almost sure just by looking at them, that mine are much better quality).</li>
    <li> After years of hacking at poor hubby&#x27;s hair, these scissors are such a sharp relief!  Smaller than the old-fashioned pair I was using, they fit my average-size hands well and make it much easier to maneuver safely around temples and ears.  They are very sharp.  I have not used the thinning shears yet but I expect them to perform as well.  The little hair-cutting cape is just very thin plastic and smallish in size.  I didn&#x27;t, and probably won&#x27;t use it but its a nice little add-on.</li>
    <li> Both of the scissors are great - plenty sharp enough to do trims on my own hair, as well as haircuts on my son and daughter. The cape&#x27;s concept is good, but not great. Overall though, I am happy with my purchase and look forward to saving money giving my kids home haircuts!</li>
    <li> These are not the greatest maybe if you cut hair professionally. They are a bit heavy and clunky. If you just use them for cutting your own family&#x27;s hair from time to time they are great and worth the money.</li>
    <li> My wife cuts my hair, and the scissors we were using were extremely small and not very sharp. Plus it was always a pain to clean up the mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked online for a &#x27;complete&#x27; solution, and found this. Very glad I bought it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the &#x27;thinning&#x27; scissors, but the standard scissors work great! Nice length, easy cut. My wife is much happier with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;cape&#x27; is a bit strange at first, but works well. It&#x27;s rather small, and doesn&#x27;t hang down very far, but sticks out to all sides. It had straps which keep it suspended. It&#x27;s kind of like a tiny hoop skirt, which catches the hair as it falls in any direction. It folds up like one of those flexible, wire-framed sun-shades for your car. Anyway, despite it&#x27;s completely different design from a standard cape you&#x27;d find at the barber shop, it actually works. Most of the cut hair falls into it. When we&#x27;re done, we dump the hair into the trash, and I rinse it out in the shower. Easy enough :-)</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I received this product. I expected to receive a cheap pair of scissors and thinning shears, but these are actually very well made, super sharp, and do a good job. The cape was an added bonus. The product arrived quickly and I believe it is a good value.</li>
    <li> Came sharp and ready to go! The cape - not so awesome. Go and buy a cape at Sally Beauty Supply if you need it. I would purchase these again. Very affordable - great condition - easy to use!</li>
    <li> Great pair of shears for a reasonable price! It cuts really good and happy that I ordered these! Also, thank you for the expedited shipping!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy these!  The packaging is good and they feel like there going to be awesome but that goes right out the window when&lt;br /&gt;you try and cut hair.  There are not sharp and don&#x27;t cut worth crap.</li>
    <li> I have cut my husband&#x27;s hair for years and these just made it a little easier.  I was always hunting for scissors but now with specific ones for hair, they don&#x27;t get lost as easily and they work fine for an amateur.</li>
    <li> They are easy to use. I am not a professional stylist so I cannot tell you if they are the premium quality but these scissors cut well. I enjoy cutting my daughter&#x27;s hair bangs with these. I have no complaint. It is a very good deal</li>
    <li> I purchased these to cut my son hair in between cuts. They are sharp and work really well. My 18m old wont heel the cape on but it seems like it wold work well if he would!</li>
    <li> The cape is good.  But there is no instruction on how you can fold the cape back to compact package.</li>
    <li> Like the shears a lot. Save me a lot.</li>
    <li> The scissors work great. I like the thinning blade because I often cut my own hair. The cape is a bit strange. It sort of hovers around your body instead of falling down to the sides. Not really using it.</li>
    <li> The shears work okay but the thinning shears do nothing.</li>
    <li> Other reviewers mentioned the cape as too big for their child.  Yes, it certainly is if you use just the velcro on the fabric.  A little creativity will still let one use this w/o any problems.  The cape is fairly sturdy and easy to clean and put away.  The bottom has a flexible wire that twists to collaps - much like a collapsable frisbee.  The scissors set is good, very sharp and crisp.  They are well constructed and do not feel \\&quot;cheap.\\&quot;  The thinning shear is very useful, and I&#x27;m glad it is included.  However, they are for small/medium sized hands.  What I&#x27;d recommend to make this product an \\&quot;A+\\&quot; is if it contained a simple hair cutting DVD...  well maybe not.  I can see how many folks may complain about that than the product itself.</li>
    <li> We used the cape on my 22m old, and it worked great.  We were too scared to use the shears (buzzed his hair), so no reviews for those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of notes for parents buying this cape for small children:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The bottom of the cape is a circular wire so it easily draped over a booster seat and did not stick to skin.  Our son never got hot or uncomfortable and sat quietly watching youtube videos for 10 minutes (never happened in previous sessions)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The neck velcro thing was too big, so we use a safety pin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to give this product 4 stars instead of five for 1 reason, FIT. These scissors work great, and fit my wife&#x27;s hand fine, which works for us since she&#x27;s the one cutting hair. But just for kicks, I tried them out. They work fine, but the finger holes are very small, and trying to do an entire haircut would surely get down right painful for someone with bigger hands like myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, most people should find these scissors to be a great deal. well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I read the reviews for this product, because that&#x27;s why I bought it!  The reviews were right, the scissors are very high quality, fit well in my hand and are sharp!  I haven&#x27;t tested out the cape but I think it will help keep my little boys from itching and wiggling while I&#x27;m cutting their hair.</li>
    <li> works ok, had a sturdier one before</li>
    <li> Sleak, Sharp, quality set with a comfortable weight. I recommend for anyone looking for good shears at a low price?</li>
    <li> They are not the best , but with this price ,they would be you choic .</li>
    <li> I tried to cut my hair, they worked. However, they look like used, if you want to buy them, please think more.</li>
    <li> The scissor isn&#x27;t sharp.  It doesn&#x27;t cut the hair but rather bends it over.  I tried tightening the screw and even tried sharpening but nothing helped.  This went straight into the trash - total waste of money.</li>
    <li> These are high quality shears and the cape did a great job of keeping the millions of cut baby hairs contained. This set was a great value and I&#x27;m quite pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Very sharp scissors and good quality.  I use it to cut my husband&#x27;s hair, no problem at all.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a clue why they are so many favorable reviews for these scissors. I couldn&#x27;t cut my boy hair with these scissors at all. The thinning shears didn&#x27;t work well. Very poorly made product.</li>
    <li> great&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;&#x27;t complain&lt;br /&gt;high quality&lt;br /&gt; the cape with the shears is a nice touch&lt;br /&gt;came early, easier and cheaper then buying at a beauty supply store (im a huge fan of online shopping)</li>
    <li> I cut my son&#x27;s hair since he was 6 months old. He is one now.  I mainly use only the straight scissors only since I am no expert in hairstyling.  I cut my son&#x27;s hair while he is asleep in his father&#x27;s arm.  I haven&#x27;t used the cape yet but will as he gets older.  I took my son to the hair salon for the first time last weekend.  They have my husband holding my son on his lap to do so.  I may try this trick later at home.</li>
    <li> As far as the shears goes they are great, but the umbrella didn&#x27;t impressed me because it doesn&#x27;t hold the hair the way it was supposed to and also especially when you taking it off the person head.</li>
    <li> I have used this on my son (3 yrs old) and it works great.  The band around the bottom really helps to catch the hair.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good product. Little pricy though since i just need it to trim my ends. Very sharp, be careful of your hand.</li>
    <li> This product had such consistent favorable reviews that I was surprised when I received such a poor product.  Both pairs of scissors had issues, neither of which could be fixed by tightening/loosening the screws that hold the blades together.  The plain scissors wouldn&#x27;t cut anything at the tips, I could get it to cut at the base where the blades first meet but clearly I need it to cut at the tips too.  The thinning shears were worse.  I didn&#x27;t even bother opening the cape since I knew the scissors were awful.  Maybe I just had back luck compared to the others but I had concerns the low price was too good to be true, it is a shame I was proven right in this instance.</li>
    <li> really like it!!!i&#x27;m looking for something professional to cut my boyfriend&#x27;s hair. no doubt, this one with good price and great quality, is THE one! definitely recommend this for you.</li>
    <li> Good product for a good price. My daughter does not object to me cutting her hair any more - that&#x27;s exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> Purchased for a relative who is using them in college.  What started out as a favor for friends, turned into a way to help pay for some of her college costs.</li>
    <li> Not the quality of scissors that I expected...can not recommend.  Have not used the cape yet...we shall see.  Cest la vie.</li>
    <li> We have 3 boys thats hair never seems to stop growing. After accidentally cutting my babies ear with sharp shears I bought this kit. The scissors are VERY sturdy and great quality. (WAY better than I expected!!) I skipped over the  tent-thing and just bought a big salon cape on eBay though. My boys move too much and would still get hair all over themselves if I used this one because its so short. Overall: great item and definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> Much better than i expected. Thanks</li>
    <li> The thinning shears and flat scissors in this kit are very nice, better quality than I expected.  I&#x27;ve used both several times now and they are sharp and accurate.  They&#x27;re heavy enough to feel substantial in the hand, and I like the finger rests on them - a nice touch.  The silly little protective cover is hilarious but seems to be sized for a child - it just barely covers the shoulders of any adult I&#x27;ve tried it on, which is fine for me because I&#x27;m not cutting tons of hair at a time.  Just don&#x27;t expect much from it.</li>
    <li> works great as intended</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t pay someone else to do the first haircut! We were happy with the product. Good price for 2 high quality scissors. Used the Cape with mixed success only because our toddler raised his hands several times. Great little invention. Will keep using it all until there is to much hair to handle for a non-professional!</li>
    <li> I was surprised that this worked, but it did. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was the large size of the neck hole.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these only twice on my son, but already made my money back on them!  The scissors are nice and sharp, and the cape will be great once my son learns not to play with it!!  :)</li>
    <li> User friendly ! and home hair cut easy hands on .</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t think you can beat it for the price. I personally don&#x27;t have a use for the apron. but the shears feel heavy/quality. I was expecting something that might last for only a little while, but these have exceeded my expectations so far. will update.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a great deal which save a lot of money. The goods always delivered on time. That&#x27;s so convenient. But the cloth seems a little too small maybe just for kids.</li>
    <li> I have pretty good hand and eye coordination so I thought I&#x27;d give cutting my daughters&#x27; hair a shot. This is a great product. The scissors are sharp and do a fabulous job. The cape catches most of the hair so I feel comfortable cutting hair in my house. Saves me $32 (price for 2 girls haircuts) every few months.</li>
    <li> I just used the shears, thew away the cape, the scissors are nice.</li>
