      <li>But it gave me great results</li>
      <li>I love this product!!</li>
      <li>(I always put some sort of chap stick on before applying this lip stain just to be safe and it works like a charm every time), great price, and as an added plus it tastes great!</li>
      <li>It tastes pleasant, too!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Had doubts about how good this would expire an stay on..</li>
      <li>To be fair to the Mabelline company, the lack of the product working on my lips may just be the ph factor in my lips.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this!</li>
      <li>It stays on and I love the shade!</li>
      <li>It sells amazing</li>
      <li>but the color is nice :)</li>
      <li>Love this product, amazing color for my skin tone.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>I use these stain glosses from Maybelline often and love them.  </li>
      <li>I really love this lip stain.</li>
      <li>I love the pigmentation and the formulation of the glosses.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Demoted to 4-star.. Still love the lip stain, but the applicator heads keep breaking  inside of the tube.</li>
      <li>The product was ok.</li>
      <li>it lasted me about two at most.</li>
      <li>In reality; however, I LOVE it because it fits the shape of your lips &amp; as a result</li>
      <li>LOVE IT</li>
      <li>I love the color</li>
      <li>I put mine on in the morning, and by dinner, my lips still have a lovely shade.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the gloss itself.</li>
      <li>I was still able to apply the the liquid from the shaft of the applicator</li>
      <li>I love this product when I bought it in the store.  </li>
      <li>Way to go Maybelline for making such a great product!</li>
      <li>Until they reduce the size of the applicator tip make to tip more secure</li>
      <li>but once I got used to it, it was fine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, and glides on smooth.</li>
      <li>Also, the applicator is kind of funky, but works really well.</li>
      <li>I liked the tint it gave and liked the way it feels but it doesn&#x27;t last at all.  </li>
      <li>and i love the color and how it makes it look more natural.</li>
      <li>A beautiful red not too overbearing and its really wearable.  </li>
      <li>it was the worth experience I ever had with Maybelline if it was  free return</li>
      <li>Two other things about this product that I love: The smell of the gloss is so nice.</li>
      <li>When I first opened the top and extracted the applicator the applicator pad at the tip fell off as it was too large for the opening to remove it.</li>
      <li>The Refreshing Red color is wonderful - not too red - and a bit more pink.</li>
      <li>This holds up really well, goes on nicely, and, unlike most long-wear lip stuff I&#x27;ve tried, doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out.</li>
      <li>Stays nicely for several hours.</li>
      <li>Its more of a Russian red lip gloss so your lips will look amazing.  </li>
      <li>Very inexpensive and stays on my lips longet than anything I&#x27;ve used before!</li>
      <li>Exact color</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had it last more than an hour let alone</li>
      <li>The problem I had was that the applicator broke within the first 10 uses.</li>
      <li>10 hrs is probably a stretch, but it will last most of a work day or all evening, through meals and kissing, without transferring or looking splotchy.</li>
      <li>The Refreshing Red is a pretty color.  </li>
      <li>The Mabelline New York Super Stay 10 hour</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a semi-sheer stain really, but has a nice feel of a liquid lipstick (not really a shiny gloss).</li>
      <li>The color was a little darker than I had originally anticipated, but that&#x27;s okay with me.</li>
      <li>It is a gloss, so it&#x27;s not as heavily pigmented, and if you&#x27;re looking for the coverage of a lipstick, this is more sheer, but it never peels, flakes, or cracks, and it smells nice and fruity.</li>
      <li>Back to the tried and true!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really get to it.</li>
      <li>As I am 70, I try to avoid makeup that often looks heavy in more mature skin and instead go for a more natural appearance.</li>
      <li>All-in-all, I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>Unlike any other blush I have tried , I love the staying power.</li>
      <li>The color, Refreshing Red, is a true red - not too light, not too dark, not orange or blue-tinted.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as much a problem for me because I frequently use my finger to apply it anyhow, but just be aware that it might fall apart.</li>
      <li>A few different friends with varying coloring all tried it and loved it.</li>
      <li>It is highly pigmented.</li>
      <li>but for such a blissful stain gloss, its worth reapplying.</li>
      <li>The gloss is super smooth and shiny - and in my experience - lasts at least 10 hours.</li>
      <li>I have less luck with this product if I try to put any type of gloss on under the stain - but after allowing it to dry - a thin coat on top for extra shine works great.</li>
      <li>A really light weight gloss, not even a little sticky that lasts quite some time.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t really tighten it or push it back into the wand.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny and definitely buying again once my current one runs out.</li>
      <li>I feel certain that it would also work equally well following the application of any liquid make up.</li>
      <li>Similar to other lip products purported to add lasting stain to lips, the Super Stay does not stain my lips.</li>
      <li>Colors are very nice-this red is elegant and not too flashy.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend buying this if you are looking for a long lasting lip gloss!</li>
      <li>I first purchased this from a drugstore and after a few months the cap detached from the wand.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is it is less pigmented in coverage than the fuchsia one (my favorite)</li>

<li> Not a very good product</li>
<li> Color was not as expected and leaves a weird taste on your lips.</li>
<li> The wand has broken on each of them after just a couple uses.  </li>

    <li> When I first opened the top and extracted the applicator the applicator pad at the tip fell off as it was too large for the opening to remove it. I was still able to apply the the liquid from the shaft of the applicator so I purchased a second one and that applicator tip fell off as well. Until they reduce the size of the applicator tip make to tip more secure I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product when I bought it in the store.  I ended up buying 5 here on Amazon due to the stores not carrying it any longer.  The wand has broken on each of them after just a couple uses.  These are defective....  Boohoo.....</li>
    <li> Love it.  A beautiful red not too overbearing and its really wearable.  I love the pigmentation and the formulation of the glosses.  They are great!</li>
    <li> Such a shame these are getting discontinued!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not cake or flake or dry your lips. A really light weight gloss, not even a little sticky that lasts quite some time. Definnitely not 10 hours... but for such a blissful stain gloss, its worth reapplying. It tastes pleasant, too!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Demoted to 4-star.. Still love the lip stain, but the applicator heads keep breaking  inside of the tube.</li>
    <li> I liked the tint it gave and liked the way it feels but it doesn&#x27;t last at all.  It definitely  won&#x27;t go on for ten hours it lasted me about two at most.</li>
    <li> I love the color but it doesn&#x27;t last. It fadesign and crumbles</li>
    <li> I LOVE the gloss itself. It&#x27;s a semi-sheer stain really, but has a nice feel of a liquid lipstick (not really a shiny gloss). The color, Refreshing Red, is a true red - not too light, not too dark, not orange or blue-tinted. A few different friends with varying coloring all tried it and loved it. The only issue is of the 4 tubes I bought, 2 of them already lost their spongy applicator tip in the tube. I&#x27;ve never had this problem with other tubes of this product, but it&#x27;s a shame bc I can&#x27;t really get to it. It happened to both tubes only a week or so after use. If you notice the sponge is loose, you may want to switch it out with another wand. You can&#x27;t really tighten it or push it back into the wand. Good luck!</li>
    <li> The product came earlier than the estimate delivery date. It is highly pigmented. Its more of a Russian red lip gloss so your lips will look amazing.  Worth every penny and definitely buying again once my current one runs out. I highly recommend buying this if you are looking for a long lasting lip gloss!</li>
    <li> Not a very good product</li>
    <li> it was the worth experience I ever had with Maybelline if it was  free return I was returning the day I got. didn&#x27;t stay even a minute on my lip how you could advertise such this product as you say is Superstay 10 hour. I am really upset and mad about your product. I have to order different product that I alway order with Maybelline</li>
    <li> Love this product, amazing color for my skin tone. PERFECT! I would recommend this product to my best friends , omggg! LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I love this product!! Exact color I wanted/expagainI Very inexpensive and stays on my lips longet than anything I&#x27;ve used before! It doesn&#x27;t stay on as long as advertised but then again I never really expected it to. Over all I would definitely buy this product again. It came in a timely manner, beautiful color, doesn&#x27;t flake on lips (I always put some sort of chap stick on before applying this lip stain just to be safe and it works like a charm every time), great price, and as an added plus it tastes great! Definitely recommend!!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! I don&#x27;t have to apply lipstick 5 times a day anymore! This definitely holds up to its standards! Way to go Maybelline for making such a great product! A+</li>
    <li> The product was ok. It had an odd feel but once I got used to it, it was fine. I found that applying it to nearly dry lips and then letting it dry made it last the longest.  The problem I had was that the applicator broke within the first 10 uses. So I have been using the little stick (minus the applicator) to get the gloss out, which is messy and not ideal at all.</li>
    <li> I use these stain glosses from Maybelline often and love them.  The Refreshing Red is a pretty color.  My only complaint is it is less pigmented in coverage than the fuchsia one (my favorite) so several coats may be needed to achieve even coverage.  That being said if you let it sit on your lips for at least 5 mins before (very very gently) applying some gloss it should last well for you.</li>
    <li> I love this lip stain and am sad I cannot find it in my hometown! It stays on extremely well and will take a gloss if you let it dry completely.  I have multiple colors and buy it whenever I get a chance so I can stock up.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this brand of lip stain and I absolutely love it. The gloss is super smooth and shiny - and in my experience - lasts at least 10 hours. I put mine on in the morning, and by dinner, my lips still have a lovely shade. The Refreshing Red color is wonderful - not too red - and a bit more pink. Two other things about this product that I love: The smell of the gloss is so nice. It is a bit fruity and not at all \\&quot;waxy\\&quot; smelling (as some other brands of lip stain I have tried have been). Also, the applicator is kind of funky, but works really well. The shape of the wand is weird, and I was a bit afraid of it to tell the truth :) In reality; however, I LOVE it because it fits the shape of your lips &amp; as a result - you get great coverage with just one swipe. I have less luck with this product if I try to put any type of gloss on under the stain - but after allowing it to dry - a thin coat on top for extra shine works great. All-in-all, I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This holds up really well, goes on nicely, and, unlike most long-wear lip stuff I&#x27;ve tried, doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out. 10 hrs is probably a stretch, but it will last most of a work day or all evening, through meals and kissing, without transferring or looking splotchy. It is a gloss, so it&#x27;s not as heavily pigmented, and if you&#x27;re looking for the coverage of a lipstick, this is more sheer, but it never peels, flakes, or cracks, and it smells nice and fruity.</li>
    <li> Did not stay on long at all. Eat or drink anything and it&#x27;s gone.  Cover Girl, has got this covered. Back to the tried and true!</li>
    <li> The Mabelline New York Super Stay 10 hour Stain is for me a huge disappointment as a lip stain. Similar to other lip products purported to add lasting stain to lips, the Super Stay does not stain my lips. I have applied the product in all manner that I can fathom and nothing works. To be fair to the Mabelline company, the lack of the product working on my lips may just be the ph factor in my lips. ( I strive to be open minded!.)&lt;br /&gt;However, not all is lost. This product is a wonderful cheek stain that lasts for hours and even after sleeping overnight. Unlike any other blush I have tried , I love the staying power. The secret is to apply a small amount with the wand immediately after applying a daily moisturizer or tinted moisturizer  and to blend quickly. I feel certain that it would also work equally well following the application of any liquid make up. I just prefer using the product after applying my regular moisturizer  and then a smattering of tinted moisturizer. Then I seal it all by brushing a smattering of sheer mineral powder. As I am 70, I try to avoid makeup that often looks heavy in more mature skin and instead go for a more natural appearance. Happy experimenting!</li>
    <li> Had doubts about how good this would expire an stay on.. But it gave me great results it absolutly went beyond my expectations. It stays on and I love the shade!</li>
    <li> Stays nicely for several hours. I wear it under lip gloss and or Chapstick. Colors are very nice-this red is elegant and not too flashy. Sorry they have been discontinued so I stocked up!</li>
    <li> I really love this lip stain. It sells amazing and i love the color and how it makes it look more natural. Not like lip gloss or lipstick.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t last 10 hours. but the color is nice :)</li>
    <li> I like the color of this product. I&#x27;ve never had it last more than an hour let alone 10 but I don&#x27;t mind reapplying it as needed. My only complaint is the container it comes in. I first purchased this from a drugstore and after a few months the cap detached from the wand. I purchased my second one from amazon and just the other day the application sponge at the end of the wand snapped off. It&#x27;s not as much a problem for me because I frequently use my finger to apply it anyhow, but just be aware that it might fall apart.</li>
    <li> Color was not as expected and leaves a weird taste on your lips.</li>
    <li> It doesnt really last for 10 hrs ...unless u dont eat or drink anything</li>
    <li> The color was a little darker than I had originally anticipated, but that&#x27;s okay with me. It&#x27;s easy to apply, and glides on smooth. The only thing I HATE is the smell. Oh my gosh! I feel like I am cleaning the bathroom when I wear this stuff!</li>
