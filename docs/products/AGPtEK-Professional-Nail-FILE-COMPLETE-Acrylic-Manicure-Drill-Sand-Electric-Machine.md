<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Arrived at a good time. Works great!</li>
    <li> I love this! Amazing quality for the price. This is professional quality.  I ordered it expecting to be disappointed because it cost so little, but I was pleasantly surprised.  definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> My foot petal never worked, other than that. I&#x27;m happy. Wish I could have a new petal shipped to me.</li>
    <li> I placed a order on December 3rd and this product came 6 days later. I was please that it had instruction but on the other hand when it is being used it gets hot but not to hot that you cant continue using it. This is way I am rating this product a 4 but anything else i like this product.</li>
    <li> Perfect for me. I love the option to use the got peddle or not.</li>
    <li> Great buy. Almost salon grade.</li>
    <li> Works great A+ thank you!!</li>
    <li> Love it works like a professional drill from the nail shop</li>
    <li> Foot petal does not work .. And as I posted to my Facebook my friend odered same one and said hers didn&#x27;t work either but it shipped fast</li>
    <li> this machine is wonderful it gives me the professional look of the salon without having to spend  the salon prices</li>
    <li> I do my own acrylic nails. Really like this for the price. It is great for home use.  I don&#x27;t think I would use this in a professional setting.  It gets pretty warm after it is used for awhile.  I have the luxury of running it slower and letting it cool off since it&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> All in all the drill works but the foot pedal dose not!! Disappointed</li>
    <li> I have used this machine several times and it works well.  I especially like having the foot control.  For the price it works as I expected.</li>
    <li> very good product, I am very satisfied and happy with the quality and speed of delivery.</li>
    <li> It was broken when I received it.</li>
    <li> Works awesome but foot pedal does not work 👎. No way to contact the seller, just option to return.</li>
    <li> I have only tried it out, it seems really smooth and I like the option that I can either use the pedal or hand.  I will check back after I have given it an official test run.  Also it&#x27;s really light weight and easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;okay, I have only used this thing 3 times and on the  3rd time I heard a loud pop and smoke came from the machine.  Mind you I have had it since the last part of 2014, I do not use it professionally only for myself to file the acrylic on my two big toes, when I don&#x27;t feel like or can&#x27;t afford to get a pedicure. I read an review that described the same thing happening with this same machine but stupid me thought well that&#x27;s probably just one in a million how wrong was I waste of money, get anything but this crap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this drill for a week. And for the price it was unbeatable and the product itself is pretty good. I&#x27;m in school as a nail tech so i needed a drill to practice with. From what I&#x27;ve learned in school the hand piece is suppose to be light, have little vibration and high torque (which means it need power behind to bit so it don&#x27;t buckle). This product&#x27;s hand piece is a bit heavy and does have some vibration but as advertise it had a high torque which i like. Over all for the price, it&#x27;s a great product and i would recommend it to someones as a starter drill. I&#x27;m very happy with my new drill and cant wait to use it on clients. And i hope it lasts me for a good while.</li>
    <li> I have done nails professionally for 12 years now at a high end salon.  I have always used an e file and after I had to send mine in after a client knocked it out of my hand and the bit broke off inside of it, I needed just a cheap one to get me through a couple days.  NOT EVEN POSSIBLE!  It had power to the motor but the hand piece wouldn&#x27;t spin, at all.  So frustrating and a waste of my time.  Not looking forward to the hassle of sending it back.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.  It had strings of glue still on it from them quickly gluing it together.  So disappointing. What a pain.</li>
    <li> Product came jus as described there were some hiccups but seller was great about correcting and replies to emails fast. Satisfied with my transaction product works well! Thank you for my nail file!</li>
    <li> This is great for doing my nails at home. I don&#x27;t think it would be good for a professional who would be using it constantly because it does get hot. But for me its great. The only things I had to buy extra were extra sanding bands and the really coarse metal file attachment. Otherwise it is ready to use. It was packaged well and was delivered quickly. No Complaints..</li>
    <li> on time for the holidays, product is brand new wont be able to tell if it works really good yet but the quality is professional quality heavy duty and the power seems powerful.</li>
    <li> love this drill deff gets the job done!</li>
    <li> Great product So far! Its very sturdy and only gets warm when its in use for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the packaging. Satisfied with the product, very quiet, minimal vibration, light to hold &amp; work with it. Only negative it doesnt go to total stand by have to adjust then turn off. Overall great drill</li>
    <li> This is a small machine that has just enough power to sculpt my acrylic nails, but not so much that it overheats the nail.  I*t does not overheat no matter how long you run it.  I get beautiful nails with it every time.  I am not sorry I purchased this.</li>
    <li> Nice drill. Love the pedal. Great for starter&#x27;s and professional nail technicians . Easy to use. I highly recommend this drill.</li>
    <li> The price is cheap. What I dont like is that the drill bit is a push on or pull off. It heat up if running on high speed.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with my purchase! I am a nail tech that works from home and surprisingly this drill does the job and does the job well! Oh and I recieved it in less than a week! 😃 *Sidenote* TO WORK THE FOOTPEDAL, THE MACHINE NEEDS TO BE IN OFF POSITION!</li>
    <li> Love this drill! It&#x27;s quiet and gets the job done right! Follow me on Instagram @b_ohso_brilliant! A must have for nail ppl like me!</li>
    <li> its just what i wanted,so far im happy ,will use it to see what i think about it we will see.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great in every way it vibrates a little and some times the drill bit gets hot but the rest is fine</li>
    <li> This drill is a pretty decent one....the speeds get pretty fast and it does the job. I would recommend buying more drill bits because the ones they come with wear down pretty fast. Thats the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of the 5.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and love the fact it has a reverse switch on it. Makes doing nails at home very easy and efficient.</li>
    <li> i was suppose to receive a new drill and got a old one thats beat all up</li>
    <li> I saw some bad reviews abut this product before I ordered but what i have to say is not bad at all, Im not a pro yet but it really helps me filing the nails... for the price is a good product.</li>
    <li> I love it.  It&#x27; very professional.</li>
    <li> When this arrived, there was no plastic seal and the box was all bent up like it was opened before.  I looked inside and the contents were haphazardly placed in there.  Kind of gross to think that someone is selling a used nail product, and shocked that they didn&#x27;t mention in the description that it is used.  I was going to give this to my daughter as a birthday gift, can&#x27;t do that now!</li>
    <li> This product really does the job! I only gave 4 stars tho because unlike the photo, I didn&#x27;t get it in a nice box as shown, which would&#x27;ve been great for storing it.  There were no product instructions so I had to figure out how to work the foot pedal on my own, which I did figure out after using manually for about two weeks or more. Otherwise, I&#x27;d give the product itself 5 stars for usage and ease of handling.</li>
    <li> I have customers i have referred and installed their laceFrontal who Love There hair and as a professional you don&#x27;t take away what looks good feels good flat irons out and returns to an awesome curl/wave. When you install someone&#x27;s hair the biggest challenge is them taking care of their own laceFrontal. Wow no problems for them no tangles no  dryness and will curl with little to no effort. .... a product worth the money and the quality of the service AWESOME , they will take time to answer any questions about the product  and answers right away. one satisfied hairstylest with a few satisfied customers! Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;the shedding is very minimum to almost none.</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s a powerful machine. I&#x27;m an independent nail tech and I&#x27;ve purchase many electric nail files. This one is by far my fav.  FYI. The foot petal works when the machine is flipped off. It comes with bits. My bits from My vogue slim electric nail file fit as well. It files through thick acrylic in No time. Jus be careful of the speed you put it on it will burn nail beds.</li>
