      <li>Absolutely Amazing!</li>
      <li>Very happy with this product &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>Love the lotions, and I especially love the gloves!</li>
      <li>The scent is pleasant and it truly does moisturize the driest skin.</li>
      <li>I wish it had a pleasant fragrance.  </li>
      <li>This looked like a good product; just don&#x27;t order it from the VitaminLife vendor.</li>
      <li>Bought these as bridesmaid gifts, my girls loved them.</li>
      <li>The products feel good but the almond milk hand creme smells rancid.</li>
      <li>I LOVED the almond cream.  </li>

      <li>Good moisturizer.</li>

      <li>I know Burt Bees have good products, but</li>
      <li>so this must be a good product.</li>
      <li>Product good</li>
      <li>and these are just as good as any I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Great stuff, the lemon butter cuticle cream in particular was awesome.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s reassuring to know there are still great American companies producing great products with top-notch customer service.  </li>
      <li>I really love this kit a lot, all the products in it are great.</li>
      <li>I like the almond cream, best cream I&#x27;ve ever tried for dry, bleeding cracked hands, incredible!</li>
      <li>The gloves are super nice (love the bee design on them!), the shea butter hand creme is great and very effective for damaged skin (I know some people don&#x27;t like the smell of this creme, but I&#x27;m not one of them!), the hand lotion is very nice, and probably the cuticle cream is too (I rarely use it).</li>
      <li>I am in LOVE with my Burt&#x27;s Bees Hand repair Kit!</li>
      <li>/&gt;You will like this for sure!  </li>
      <li>Love all 3 products!</li>
      <li>I also love the hand care products that came with the gloves!</li>
      <li>Glad I purchased this!</li>
      <li>I just wish there was more in there!</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>You have to love Burt&#x27;s!</li>
      <li>(i love all their scents, almonds, lemon, and the gloves are so considerate)!</li>
      <li>This kit is amazing.</li>
      <li>I ended up using Body Shop&#x27;s Olive Body Butter which smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue and has a lighter scent.</li>
      <li>But the shea butter cream is amazing.</li>
      <li>All of the lotions/creams smell amazing.</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t provide amazing results or anything.</li>
      <li>They feel and smell amazing and work so well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice kit</li>
      <li>They smell nice and moisturize well without feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with this product which does live up to its claims.</li>
      <li>The almond milk hand creme has a light almond scent that is pleasant.</li>
      <li>It made my hands soft and has a great scent!</li>
      <li>Gloves fit fairly well.</li>
      <li>Well worth the purchase!This would be a great gift item too.</li>
      <li>The hand repair cream is amazing and the bee gloves are freakin&#x27; adorable.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, incredibly moisturizing, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t sit on top of skin.</li>
      <li>All the other products are very good though and the price is great compared to purchasing them separately.</li>
      <li>Hope the almond works as well as the banana; it certainly feels great on my hands.</li>
      <li>and I see a HUGE difference!</li>
      <li>The banana hand cream is good for maintaining moisture on an every day basis and has a really fun smell, but</li>
      <li>Maybe it will get better.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the aftereffect of it on my hands and just washed it off.</li>
      <li>I love everything in this kit.</li>
      <li>I love the Bees.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of the lemon cuticle cream.</li>
      <li>Love, love it</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m planning to buy more of the two cremes.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>and I love the gloves.</li>
      <li>Would love to hear a company response.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Would make sure my mom has started using hers too.</li>
      <li>I let it sit in the closet for a while because I thought I&#x27;d never be able to sleep with gloves on my hands.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> There a few products inside. The gloves which I thought would be useless are actually great. They are thin cotton and I can wear them all night without sweating. The almond milk cream is good, but not great, it&#x27;s rich but a bit greasy as would be expected, and I only ever wear it overnight with gloves. The lemon butter cuticle cream is ok, but frankly I wouldn&#x27;t buy it separately, I would just use regular cream. But the shea butter cream is amazing. It&#x27;s light, incredibly moisturizing, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t sit on top of skin. I wish this tube was bigger. This is the one I will buy again.</li>
    <li> The lotions smell funny.  I would put this on at bedtime, but would have to get up and wash it off because the smell bothered me so much.</li>
    <li> I like their products</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not necessarily a great  package - fairly small proportions of product. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again for myself, but it would be good as a gift. I did find it a couple of dollars cheaper at Walmart.</li>
    <li> The kit is described as containing a banana wax hand cream, but that product was replaced with an almond cream which is clearly inferior. Amazon will not replace the product, as they claim this \\&quot;is not their error, but the vendor which supplies them. Again, buyer beware.</li>
    <li> And that&#x27;s not terrible, but Amazon really needs to update their product listing to indicate that it may come with either one.    Otherwise, I like this kit, have purchased it in the past, and probably will again sometime in the future.  The gloves are super nice (love the bee design on them!), the shea butter hand creme is great and very effective for damaged skin (I know some people don&#x27;t like the smell of this creme, but I&#x27;m not one of them!), the hand lotion is very nice, and probably the cuticle cream is too (I rarely use it).</li>
    <li> REVISED REVIEW:  In my initial review I was very unhappy that there were two substitutions in the kit I received - plain yellow gloves (no bees) and Almond Milk (not Banana) Creme. I contacted Burt&#x27;s Bees to let them know I was disappointed, especially given the cost of shipping to return items not as advertised.  I AM VERY IMPRESSED WITH BURT&#x27;S BEES.  They responded to my email within 24 hours.  I&#x27;ve also used the products in the kit.  Although I really wanted the bee gloves, the yellow pair is well-made and comfortable.  The cuticle and hand cremes are excellent.       Hopefully Burt&#x27;s and their vendors will update their product descriptions ASAP so people aren&#x27;t disappointed and overlook the high quality of their products.    It&#x27;s reassuring to know there are still great American companies producing great products with top-notch customer service.  Thanks, Burt&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Product as described.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I don&#x27;t expect it to work immediately. I have been using it for about 2 weeks. It feels good enough but not great. That is my hands feel moisturized but not as soft or great as other reviewers did. Maybe it will get better.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is the absolute best, especially the hand healing cream and cuticle oil! And the gloves are an added bonus. Buy it, its twice the money @ target!</li>
    <li> This kit is all you need for hand repair.   I&#x27;m not organized enough to use all the creams as a system and wear the little gloves, but even still each cream works great individually to repair dry and damaged skin.  The lemon cuticle cream and the shea butter repair cream give an instant fix.  The banana hand cream is good for maintaining moisture on an every day basis and has a really fun smell, but probably not something you&#x27;d want to apply before going out into public or shaking hands with other people.  The kit comes with a clear drawstring bag to store everything together.</li>
    <li> This is a good product! Love the lotions, and I especially love the gloves! The only thing I&#x27;m not happy with is the don&#x27;t send the banana hand cream...it&#x27;s an almond hand cream, which doesn&#x27;t smell that great. I ordered 2 of these and they both came with the almond. But that&#x27;s the only issue I have with it!</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom who suffers from painfully dry hands in the winter - bad enough to bleed.  It&#x27;s very hard to talk her into using lotions and creams because she doesn&#x27;t like the greasy feel and is worried about transferring the greasiness to the things she touches.  The Burts Bees Hand Repair Kit includes these cute gloves that persuaded her to go ahead and use the lotions and creams, and the choice of stuff in the kit was pleasant and helpful - especially the hand repair lotion in the purple tube - strong stuff!  A great gift that I&#x27;ll be getting for her again.</li>
    <li> The box arrived and was left outside and got all wet.  Product good, it is very small.  Picture does not should how small it really it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Burt&#x27;s Bees lover for quite some time and this product is no exception.  The hand repair cream is amazing and the bee gloves are freakin&#x27; adorable.  Just apply a small amount of repair cream to your hands, put on the gloves, go to bed, then wake up with soft hands.  Yes, it&#x27;s really THAT simple!  The banana hand cream and cuticle cream are great for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used of of these kits, I received it as a gift from my husband.  I let it sit in the closet for a while because I thought I&#x27;d never be able to sleep with gloves on my hands.  Please don&#x27;t let that deter you from buying this product!  The gloves are so soft and breathable that you won&#x27;t notice you&#x27;re wearing them after the first couple minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My goal is to provide a thorough review to assist others with their purchase, as there are many choices on Amazon and I personally rely on reviews when making most of my purchases.  If my review was helpful to you, please choose “yes” below.  Otherwise, choose “no” and please leave a constructive comment and I will take your thoughts and/or suggestions into consideration for future reviews.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really used this much. It&#x27;s a nice kit and I love the gloves.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item through VitaminLife with plenty of time until Christmas.  They just notified me 3 days before Christmas that they were cancelling my order because it was \\&quot;out of stock.\\&quot;  I placed the order a week and a half ago and they just notified me, so I can&#x27;t order a replacement before Christmas.  This looked like a good product; just don&#x27;t order it from the VitaminLife vendor.</li>
    <li> It could smell better, but it makes my hands super soft even after only one use. I also use it on my feet.</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products. I didn&#x27;t need everything in the kit, but it&#x27;s difficult to find only the products I need without buying the kit.</li>
    <li> This is honestly the best \\&quot;beauty\\&quot; $13 I have ever spent. As a beauty pageant queen (2010/2011)and business executive, I am constantly on the search for products that are effective, yet easy to use and obtain. With this set, I have found what I need! I purchased it originally on Amazon, and have also found it at WalMart for approximately the same price.  The negatives I have heard here are the following:  kit comes with almond rather than banana hand cream  kit comes with yellow rather than bee print gloves  Let me address both.....  Kit comes with almond rather than banana hand cream: I have never heard of nor used the brand&#x27;s almond or banana hand cream before this, however the almond hand cream which I received is AMAZING! I seriously received this kit two days ago, and after using this lotion + gloves only for the two days, I have the softest hands I have ever experienced in my entire life. My husband, who has serious scent allergies, is not affected by the smell and tells me that I smell amazing after I put this on before bed. This is the most amazing lotion/cream I have ever encountered (and in my pageant/modeling experience I have tried many products)-- even after washing my hands multiple times throughout the day, the softness lasts...unlike other products that are more expensive and offer just a temporary moisture boost.  Kit comes with yellow rather than bee print gloves --  Really? Ok, yes, the picture on the package shows gloves with a print of little bees on it. Maybe the company should update their packaging. However, I would rather have them spend the money on developing more amazing products like the ones they currently offer. The bee print cotton gloves and the pale yellow cotton gloves (which I received) I would think offer the exact same benefits. Do you see the print when you wear them while you sleep? The pale yellow gloves, which I own as part of this kit, are absolutely amazing. I have purchased many pairs of spa gloves, spending up to $40/pair....and these are just as good as any I&#x27;ve tried. Yes, they are simply cotton gloves. However, they are durably constructed, and fit well on my small hands (many gloves come off my tiny hands during the night because they are too large; these don&#x27;t do so).   In summary, the gloves + almond hand cream + lemon cuticle cream combination has given me results better than I ever anticipated, and I hope you try it for yourself. Believe me....I have spent several hundred dollars to try everything out there....and Burt&#x27;s Bees products are second to none!</li>
    <li> I got the one with Almond-whatever creme, which is what I was hoping for. Honestly, all of the products are fantastic, and sold a lot cheaper than when sold separate. I love the little purple cream and the cuticle oil in particular. The almond oil is ok, but the other two fit in my purse well. The gloves are a bit cheap, but do what they&#x27;re supposed to. This is a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; for anyone who has dry hands, works outside, or picks at their cuticles!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Shea Butter: This natural fat obtained from the fruit of the karite tree is a valuable, nourishing addition to moisturizers for the reduction of wrinkles and to improve the elasticity of the skin and protect it against environmental aging. Shea butter is known to increase local capillary circulation, which in turn increases tissue re-oxygenation. \\&quot;  From the Burt&#x27;s Bees website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit includes shea butter hand repair cr&amp;egrave;me, beeswax and banana hand cr&amp;egrave;me (which smells so delicious) the lemon butter cuticle cr&amp;egrave;me (also yummy smelling), the bee gloves and an instruction booklet.  You keep your nails in shape with the lemon butter cuticle cr&amp;egrave;me, moisturize your hands with the banana cr&amp;egrave;me and overnight you put on the shea butter and cotton gloves for intensive repair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I think that&#x27;s missing from this kit - the hand salve.  That stuff is awesome.  So an additional Bert&#x27;s Bees purchase was in order for me.  This kit is great and a wonderful gift for nurses, gardener&#x27;s or anyone who suffers dry hands.  My son has OCD and over-washes his hands, so I got a kit for him too, to heal his red chapped little hands.</li>
    <li> As a nurse I have extremely dry hands.  Using this every night I can see an improvement.  Will continue to use this for as long as they make it!!</li>
    <li> The kit was smaller than I expected.  Everything seemed just a touch bigger than the \\&quot;free gift\\&quot; deals you used to get with cosmetic purchases in some department stores.  The gloves were poorly constructed (it looks like the person who sewed it couldn&#x27;t hold the seams straight on the sewing machine), and I did NOT like the smell of anything except for the almond cream.  The hand repair cream, in particular, had a sharply medicinal and astringent smell that I did not find at all pleasant.  I ended up throwing away everything except the almond cream and the gloves.  I LOVED the almond cream.  This almost redeemed the entire package for me.  It&#x27;s very thick, but not greasy, and has a light and pleasant almond smell to it.  Honestly, the kit might have been a decent-to-good purchase for about half the price since it did let me sample a bunch of products I&#x27;ve been curious about, but at it&#x27;s current price, I didn&#x27;t think it was worth the purchase.  Looking back, I wish I&#x27;d just bought some well-constructed spa gloves and a bucket of that almond cream.</li>
    <li> I have been a big fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees lemon butter cuticle cream for years, and was very happy to find this little hand healing kit.    The beeswax and banana hand creme is super creamy &amp; highly scented, but the scent dissipates pretty quickly once you start massaging it into your hands.  It leaves a slightly greasy feel on your hands, but that&#x27;s Ok with me.    I follow up and application of the hand creme with massaging the cuticle balm into my nails.  This also has a pretty strong scent to it, but it is a little nicer than the banana, it is more natural smelling (even though both products are nearly 100% natural)    Burt&#x27;s Bees products are the only ones that have been able to heal my very dry hands and fingers.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, the lemon butter cuticle cream in particular was awesome.</li>
    <li> Gift for a friend, she says she loves it!</li>
    <li> Not my cuppa tea. Greasy.  Unpleasant scent.</li>
    <li> Idems are smaller than I thought, but i am pleased with them.</li>
    <li> Arrived timely, and as described.</li>
    <li> I received the package and it was as expected. All of the lotions/creams smell amazing. I have only had a spa treatment once but the almond milk and shea butter smells brought back the same memories. They are VERY calming. Your whole body relaxes at the aroma. My only complaint is in tune with the other reviewer: I wish the gloves were not made in China. This is an American company (which is one of the reasons I use their goods) so they should find an American company who makes gloves. I would pay a little more for that.</li>
    <li> I have very thin skin, the result of hemo dialysis and medications, and I have to wash my hands frequently because of an almost non existent immune system. My hands and nails were wrecked.&lt;br /&gt;I had tried other Burt&#x27;s products, lip balm and acne face wash, and had loved them, so I got their Hand Kit.[[ASIN:B0009F3R7E Burt&#x27;s Bees Hand Repair Kit]]&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;The hand creme is so silky, and the spa gloves help it really get absorbed into my skin. The lemon butter cuticle cream is AMAZING, and my nails look so much healthier and stronger. My thumbnail had split and using the lemon butter regularly has healed it and now it looks fine.&lt;br /&gt;I have found Burt&#x27;s Bees products to be worth every penny, especially if you have sensitivity to chemicals, as I do. They feel and smell amazing and work so well.</li>
    <li> The product was just what I thought what I was getting.  Happy with it so far. Burt&#x27;s Bees products are top notch.</li>
    <li> I have used products by Burts Bees in the past and have always gotten great results from them.  This is no exception.  Didn&#x27;t even know they made this but was looking for lotion (or anything) due to the really dry and cracking skin I&#x27;ve had lately, due to the crazy cold weather which has recently come though.  My hands were in a lot of pain and bleeding.  It was bad!!  Got the Burts Bees since I have used their lip balm and other things before.  Fixed me up pretty well.  Not totally back to normal but I can actually use my hands without a ton of pain, so that is nice.  Based on this experience I will definitely be trying more Burts Bees products when the need arises.</li>
    <li> It is what it is, my girls like it.</li>
    <li> I have used this kit in the past and I love the products included. I especially like the cuticle cream and banana hand cream. However, the kit I received did not come with the banana cream, instead it came with the almond milk hand cream. A little disappointed, but all in all, a good product.</li>
    <li> Great price for all these items! The cuticle cream is wonderful and a must have product. It moisturizes and repairs my cuticles. The hand repair cream is nice and smells very earthy. The almond cream is very rich and heavy. The smell isn&#x27;t very pleasant but its a nice cream! Its very greasy so I put that on at night and put the gloves on overnight.</li>
    <li> Love all 3 products! They smell nice and moisturize well without feeling greasy. I wash my hands a lot during the day, so I mostly use these at night. I keep this set in a tray next to my bed to use at bedtime. They arrived the day I was moving and were so helpful with the excess dryness caused by cleaning a lot and handling cardboard boxes. Haven&#x27;t tried the gloves yet but will soon!</li>
    <li> Thank goodness for this hand kit. I have super dry hands and this kit works! I love it, but I would suggest buying an extra pair of gloves because the first pair will get dirty quickly and then I had nothing to wear while I procrastinated doing laundry.</li>
    <li> My wife loves these products because of they work and protect her lips and hands from chapping and from dryness</li>
    <li> I had read the reviews about the small kit, but honestly, the items you get inside will last for a long time unless your dipping your hand in the cream jar.  In just 3 days, I have noticed a big difference.  I went to an event yesterday where I got several compliments about how soft my hands were.  And yes, guys can care about their skin and hands.  I thought it might be weird to sleep with gloves, but you hardly even know they are there.  Really impressed.  I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely Amazing! My hands have never been softer!!! My money was well spent, so glad I purchased this fantastic product!</li>
    <li> I love this hand repair kit.  It came with yellow gloves, almond hand creme and shea butter hand repair creme as well as a lemon butter cuticle cream.  I especially love the smell of the lemon cuticle cream, but the almond isn&#x27;t bad either.  After I had used the kit for a few days, I shook someone&#x27;s  hand and he commented on how soft my hand were.  That&#x27;s never happened to me before lol.  I&#x27;m almost done with the items from the kit and I&#x27;m planning to buy more of the two cremes.  The hand repair creme especially came in a very small tube, almost more of trial version, so I used it up fast.  I&#x27;m using the gloves with other hand cremes as well.</li>
    <li> Just ok. I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my hands!</li>
    <li> I am using this product for past two months or so. Yet to see the results. will update if it makes me happy !</li>
    <li> I applied the almond milk and cuticle cream at night and put the gloves on. It really worked! Loved it!</li>
    <li> Fantastic hand repair kit.  Will be buying larger sizes.  I also love it because it has all natural products.</li>
    <li> super cheap for all u get. comparable to store prices we got 60% off. the quality of all burts bees is top notch</li>
    <li> Bought these as bridesmaid gifts, my girls loved them.</li>
    <li> The creme leave a protective covering over your skin which is then locked in by the cotton gloves included. The scent is pleasant and it truly does moisturize the driest skin. I am very happy with this product which does live up to its claims.</li>
    <li> this is a gift item for a friend so i really have no opinion yet. i like the burt&#x27;s bees products i have purchased in the past so this must be a good product. the packaging is attractive and ready for gifting</li>
    <li> I bought this for my really dry hands, and it is a nice concept, but not for me.  The main objections are that the gloves shrank to child size after washing (and they needed to be washed after the first use), and the almond milk beeswax hand creme was too &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; and left a lot of residue, but once absorbed still smelled offensive to me.  I would not say this didn&#x27;t work, because I didn&#x27;t use it long enough.  I just hated the scent.</li>
    <li> One of the products stinks and I can&#x27;t use it.  They gloves are solid yellow.</li>
    <li> I have had better moisturizers on my hands.  The lotions and potions don&#x27;t seem to do ANYTHING for my drought-ridden hands.  Well, I wash them too much also.  I DO love the gloves, though.  I have big hands and I was afraid they would not stretch for me.  I needn&#x27;t have worried.  They fit me just fine and feel nice and soft.  I&#x27;m going to try and be more regular with my use of this product and see if there is a cumulative effect.  So far...nothing much to write home about.</li>
    <li> I love the Bees.  The hand set really helps to moisturize (I work with paper and boxes all day so cracks and splits in my hands from drying out is common). The set keeps my hands nice and soft and I don&#x27;t get damaged at work as easily. I just wish there was more in there!</li>
    <li> I saw the other reviews stating that the beeswax and banana hand cream had been replaced by the almond milk cream. Fine with me since I have 2 jars of the banana cream already. Hope the almond works as well as the banana; it certainly feels great on my hands. The almond smells like Amaretto and makes me want to have a drink. Yum! The supplier should have inserted a line about the substitution.    The only objection I have to the kit is that the gloves, which do not have the little bees on them as pictured, are made in China...like most everything else we buy now. Wish they were American made and that they said what the material is. Too stretchy for 100% cotton. I have large hands and the gloves fit just fine.     I ordered the product on Friday night and received it on Wednesday. Not too bad for Christmas time.</li>
    <li> This is a nice little set, smaller amounts of product than I expected.  I love the lemon butter cuticle creme and the almond milk hand creme.  Both of those smell lovely.  However, the small tube of hand repair creme is not to my liking at all. It smells very medicinal and I can&#x27;t stand to wear it.  The cotton gloves are nice, they fit my hands fine.  The bag the products came in ripped the first time I opened it.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this kit again, but would buy the cuticle creme and almond milk hand creme separately.</li>
    <li> Overall this product does the trick. I like to use the almond cream with the gloves before I go to bed but it doesn&#x27;t provide amazing results or anything. My hands are not any softer but they&#x27;re not any rougher either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks of wear the gloves developed a small hole in them from where the stitches started to come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller shea cream also smells a little odd to me.</li>
    <li> This is the first Burt&#x27;s Bees purchase I have made for my husband.  His hands get extremely rough and dry.  Often, he gets huge cracks in his skin.  He had been using lotion with artificial fragrance, but it was making the situation worse.  I love Burt&#x27;s Bees because the fragrances and colors are all natural and I knew it wouldn&#x27;t harm his skin.  I used everything from the cuticle cream, lotion, to the salve on his hands before he put on the gloves to keep the moisture in.  In just a short time, it has already made a great improvement.  If it were not for the &amp;#34;extremely tiny&amp;#34; portion of the hand salve, I would have rated this as five stars.</li>
    <li> I started using this kit in 2005 and really, my hands just get so soft and healthy and younger looking from this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smells are clean and herbal, and the products dont make you feel like you have wet hands under the gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will like this for sure!  the price could be 2x as much and it would be well worth it.  the products last for a very long time.</li>
    <li> I want to start out by saying that there is nothing wrong with the products. They do what they are supposed to do. However I cannot get over the scent of the lotions. I got the almond milk beeswax hand cream instead of the banana beeswax hand cream: no big deal. I tried the shea butter repair cream one night and then the almond milk hand cream the following night. I could not get over their strong scents. I love the lemon cuticle oil and I&#x27;ve tried it before. I guess I assumed that the other products would have the same light, refreshing smell. Instead, they are quite strong, even after leaving the product on my hands for a while. I should have found a tester for each item before I bought the kit. I&#x27;m keeping the lemon cuticle oil but giving the other stuff to my mom. Also, the gloves have a very strong scent right out of the box. Does this scent go away after a few washes?</li>
    <li> This is a very nice Kit. Every cream or lotion smelled great. The item arrived on time and packaged well. My only complaint was that in the picture shown online, the gloves looked like they had little bees on them. However, the gloves I received were just plan yellow. I know this is a small complaint but I just wish the description was more accurate. Overall, I would recommend this item and seller.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Softened my hands up within one use.  Gloves fit fairly well.</li>
    <li> I WISH I had taken a before photo the night I started using this! Only three nights and I see a HUGE difference! The cuticles around my thumb nails were so cracked that they would bleed. During the cold months (like right now) my hands also get super dry and itchy. I scratch so much in my sleep, that I scratch the skin raw sometimes! Three nights, and my hands are healing, not itchy, and look great! No dry patches!&lt;br /&gt;Mine did not come with the Banana Cream, but instead the Almond. I love that stuff anyway, so it&#x27;s ok with me. I got the solid yellow gloves. I really wanted the Bee pattern, but they fit nicely and are great quality. So I will deal with it, haha!&lt;br /&gt;The way I use it: I put the cuticle balm on my cuticles. Then apply the shea butter hand repair cream. For my extra dry spots, I apply the almond cream and then put the gloves on. I end up taking them off after a few hours because I can&#x27;t sleep with anything on my hands (I can&#x27;t sleep in socks either). But they are still healing! Glad I purchased this!</li>
    <li> My mum ended up not liking this gift because she&#x27;s very picky about her moisturizers. I tried the almond oil and it stinks. Sorry about that - I don&#x27;t think almond oil scent is for me. It&#x27;s too strong and I found the cream very oily and sticky. I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the aftereffect of it on my hands and just washed it off. I haven&#x27;t used it since and this was last Christmas..about 9 months ago. Maybe it does the trick for other people. Just didn&#x27;t work out for my mum or me. I ended up using Body Shop&#x27;s Olive Body Butter which smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue and has a lighter scent.</li>
    <li> this may be one of the best stocking stuffers ever. it&#x27;s not too expensive, can last a full year as far as consumption goes, and is well appreciated every time it is used. this was NOT my first purchase and will NOT be my last!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving this 3 stars, because for $18 I would expect a little more cream or lotion than what you get with this. I I like the gloves, but they were yellow and no cute little bees on them like I was expecting. I know Burt Bees have good products, but really?  This stuff won&#x27;t last over a week or two during winter months. I am somewhat disappointed, but I will use this till it runs out, and then switch to other lotion with the gloves.</li>
    <li> Received item as described.</li>
    <li> Very good! Works wonders!!</li>
    <li> I brought this because my hands get so dry because of the cold weather and my hands are now back to life lol. I use the gloves at night when I sleep and I woke up my hands were so soft. It worked in just one night.</li>
    <li> I suffer from very bad eczema and my knuckles often crack and bleed in the cold weather.  I used this product once and immediately felt a difference.  The 2nd time I used it I could feel my hands healing thank G-d!  Very happy with this product &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer. Smell isn&#x27;t wonderful for hand cream, but the almond cream in jar is not offensive it softens and repletes moisture to hands.</li>
    <li> Just be advised that the whole package is much smaller than it looks, and the gloves are pretty cheap.  OK if you are buying for yourself as the products themselves are great, but not much of them if you&#x27;re buying for a gift.</li>
    <li> my friend loved it so much she is waiting for her next birthday for me to give it to her again</li>
    <li> I love everything in this kit. My hands felt softer immediately.  I will continue to buy these products for my hands.</li>
    <li> I am in LOVE with my Burt&#x27;s Bees Hand repair Kit! I&#x27;m usually pretty hard on my hands, but have relied on easy DIY methods to keep them smooth and moisturized (olive oil and sea salt, primarily).This winter, however, my hands and cuticles have been exceptionally dry and fussy, my usual hand remedies have been failing me. I found this kit and decided to give it a whirl, and already I am noticing a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cuticles, previously dry and easily tearing into hangnails are now soft and supple after just a few day&#x27;s use, and my dry, chapped hands and knuckles are already retaining more moisture and are not cracking. There are still a few spots where it&#x27;s healing, so I am thankful that the formulas do not irritate my broken skin, which tends to lean to the obnoxiously sensitive side anyways. The only item I&#x27;ve found that works equally as well (or even better) is Working Hands, but while it heals, it also makes me slightly itchy. I haven&#x27;t had that issue thus far with the Burt&#x27;s Bees kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and did I mention everything smells exquisite? Just strong enough for me to notice, the cuticle balm in particular has a refreshing, energetic citrus scent to it. It&#x27;s a good price for a great product - comparable to Walmart, but with the added convenience of Prime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Burt!</li>
    <li> This kit is amazing. I bought it for my mother. She used it one night, and her hands felt softer already.</li>
    <li> This is a great kit! Hands feel amazing!</li>
    <li> Great hand cremes and the gloves work great, my hands feel like a baby again! Great for winter when skin is feeling super dry and itchy!</li>
    <li> Gift... The recipient appreciated and liked</li>
    <li> I love all of thew Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and I love the kits they have put together with different products for all types of care for your body.</li>
    <li> I get tiny, painful splits at the sides of my nails, especially on my thumbs,  when my hands are in too much water (I am not good about using rubber gloves) or when the weather is cold and dry. I also find that putting on hand cream frequently during the day doesn&#x27;t solve the problem. This little gem of a kit is doing the trick. The gloves are comfy, and the creams that come in this kit are excellent. Highly recommend this for anyone who needs to take better care of their hands...like me! I slathered on the cream and wore the gloves for two nights at first and saw a quick improvement. Now, I will wear them only occasionally to keep my hands soft. I am also using the little tub of day cream and like it, too. I am planning to use this as a little gift in the future!</li>
    <li> I got this product mainly bcause of the good reviews and got one for my mom and the other for me,did not use it for a while because I was busy,but finally,took it out today and used some before sleeping,feels really cool and the effect of its moisturizing abilities is simply wondrous to behold,this is the best handcream I have ever tried,I will update after a few days of continuous use but it is simply unbelievably softening so far and that&#x27;s what I direly needed.&lt;br /&gt;Would make sure my mom has started using hers too.</li>
    <li> Makes my hands feel very soft</li>
    <li> The products feel good but the almond milk hand creme smells rancid. I wish it had a pleasant fragrance.  This is written by my wife.</li>
    <li> I like the almond cream, best cream I&#x27;ve ever tried for dry, bleeding cracked hands, incredible! I love the smell of the lemon cuticle cream. However, the other products smell pretty bad, didn&#x27;t get the gloves with the bees, just yellow ones. Also, concerns me some products had 2010 date on them and we are in Aug of 2013. Plus, I checked Burt bees site and they sell this for two dollars cheaper. Some products are better bought on actual site.</li>
    <li> I bought the hand pack thinking this would help, as I have to wash my hands A Lot.  It made my cuticles  and hang nails worse; even wearing the gloves at night.  I will not use their products again as my lips are burning after using the lip balm.  I&#x27;ll stick with good old Vaseline and baby oil.  Much cheaper and works much better.  Their hype about beeswax sounds good but doesn&#x27;t work; stick to naturals instead of paying big bucks.  Would love to hear a company response.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bee hand repair kit is the best for tired, dry nails and hands. The products revive and enhance nails &amp; hands - it is a welcome relief for nail repair.</li>
    <li> I would LOVE this kit IF the gloves were not so danged tight! I can&#x27;t use them unless I cut the finger tips off and that defeats the purpose. All the other products are very good though and the price is great compared to purchasing them separately.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my aunt. She absolutely loves it. Uses it every night and says she doesn&#x27;t remember the last time her hands felt so soft</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees. Pretty nice stuff. I hate the greasy feeling that so many hand creams and lotions leave on your hands. Burt&#x27;s Bees absorbs into your skin very fast, yet leaves a protective barrier to help protect the skin and promote healing. The colder weather is particularly bad on my hands, since I wash them frequently, and the Burt&#x27;s Bees Hand Care kit helps keep my skin from cracking and becoming sore. I really do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am happy to say my nails are less dry. Well worth the purchase!This would be a great gift item too.</li>
    <li> I use this set all the time and really love the smell. It help my dry hands and i am hooked on Burt&#x27;s and Bees now. Shipping was as expected. Love, love it</li>
    <li> I used this kit religiously for about 3 weeks and saw a different in less than one week. My hands were much softer!</li>
    <li> Unlike other gloves purchased, these haven&#x27;t shrunk with washing.  I also love the hand care products that came with the gloves!</li>
    <li> I really love this kit a lot, all the products in it are great. I&#x27;ve used both the almond milk and the banana hand creme (which I think used to come in this set, I&#x27;m not sure). They both work great, but the banana hand creme has a strong fake banana scent (think the banana flavored runts), which I LOVE, but could be annoying to other people. The almond milk hand creme has a light almond scent that is pleasant. They both go on pretty thick so the cotton gloves are a necessity if you want to put it over your entire hands. The lemon butter cuticle cream is also wonderful, I keep it in my purse and it just put it on whenever I&#x27;m bored or notice my cuticles looking a little dry. The hand cremes also work great for your cuticles; I&#x27;ve often, especially in the winter, put just that straight on my cuticles, it cuts the need of having to wear the gloves around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this kit to anyone looking to fix their dried hands, and it also makes a great gift too!</li>
    <li> My sisters hands crank so badly during the winter that they will even bleed. I bought this for her in hopes that this would work. It has done great so far! Although her hands are still on the dry side, it has made a great improvement to her skin. If she cut back on her hand washing more I&#x27;m sure the product would do even better.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve used it twice and I can see and feel a difference. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> The items in this kit helped my hands get through the winter. Previous reviewers had noted that the pattern on the gloves don&#x27;t match the picture; this is true in my case as well. Its not a big deal because I only wear them to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish that it would come with more hand cream and less cuticle cream. That&#x27;s the treatment I really needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have the gloves, I&#x27;d probably just buy the individual components that I need in the future.</li>
    <li> Little smaller then I thought . And I can buy the exact thing from walmart.</li>
    <li> Good price, used it for baby shower prize!</li>
    <li> very useful (i love all their scents, almonds, lemon, and the gloves are so considerate)! all everyone who wants to protect their hand, this is a must-have kit!</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry hands.  The lotions in this package were great and the gloves helped all the cremes stay put overnight.  Love it!  Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Dermatologist even commented on how soft my hands are. Very happy. As a senior citizen dry skin is a problem. This really helps.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t moisturize well.</li>
    <li> This is a great little kit.  The gloves are comfortable.(others I&#x27;ve had were too tight and I couldn&#x27;t sleep in them)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the cuticle cream before and like it.  I love the almond hand cream.  It made my hands soft and has a great scent!</li>
    <li> If you use this product consistently, you will not be disappointed. It really repairs my hands after a weekend of handyman work.</li>
    <li> If you are an over hand washer like me, this is totally necessary. I use it once a week. If I didn&#x27;t my hands would crumble. You have to love Burt&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> Love this product. I like to put the creams on my hands, put on the gloves, and then watch TV. A great way to help my hands get through the winter.</li>
    <li> This is just so-so. I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s any better than any other hand cream and the cuticle softener doesn&#x27;t do anything to soften my cuticles, though I do like the scent and feel of it. I plan to use the gloves with a heavier emollient cream of another brand.</li>
    <li> great product. It made a perfect b-day gift for my friend. I recommend this product to al those looking for a good gift.Thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> my hands were in the worst shape now their super soft</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom for Christmas, she has dry hands and it works well! Makes her hands feel soft.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s hands get so chapped from working outside and the thick lotions in this kit really helped to soothe his cracked knuckles.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> The almond cream is incredible!!  Instant healing of my VERY DRY skin.  My hands get really dry in the winter, and applying the almond cream salve at night, and wearing the cotton gloves worked wonders.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my hands get so dry and cracked during the winter. I love all the parts of this kit, except for the gloves. They are just regular cotton gloves and they end up soaking up most of the lotion. Otherwise, this is a great kit.</li>
