<li> This lotion does not seem to be as moisturizing as the other lotion</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had other Nag Champa scent lotion</li>
<li> And the little sample of soap?</li>
<li> : bought a secret be bottle</li>
<li> This was so disappointing.  </li>

    <li> I LOVE this lotion! Its fragrance is actually noticeable and lingers for a few hours. I pair it with Patchouli oil and everyone always asks me what I&#x27;m wearing.

    <li> Wonderful scent! makes my skin very soft.</li>
    <li> Smells very very yummy and makes my skin so soft! I love it! Will def purchase more when I run out :)</li>
    <li> This completes my set along with the body wash and roll-on perfume oil. This is the scent I remember from my late teens and early twenties</li>
    <li> This was so disappointing.  This lotion is close to being unscented, and the scent it does have is NOT Nag Champa.  The moisturizing quality is fair.  I was really looking forward to a quality Nag Champa scented lotion from a cool small company, but it was too good to be true.  For the high price for such a small bottle, I would defintaly not recommend this product.</li>
