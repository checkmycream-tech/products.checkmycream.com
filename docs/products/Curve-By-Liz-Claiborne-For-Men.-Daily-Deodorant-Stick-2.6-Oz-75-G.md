      <li>Using the work-around, this product is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Exactly as described :)</li>
      <li>This is a good product but does not adjust by turning the bottom like my earlier purchases.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s good to finally have found a cologne based deodorant that doesn&#x27;t give me a reaction and doesn&#x27;t contain alum.</li>
      <li>My husband says this is the best deoderant for him due to his sensitive skin.....</li>

      <li>So I reluctantly ordered it online, which turned out to be pretty painless.</li>
      <li>I use non scented deodorant first and this after.  </li>
      <li>Smells great and actually lasts longer then i expected.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really smell like Curve...</li>
      <li>The unit stays airtight, that way, and lasts much longer.  </li>
      <li>I also appreciate the reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Wayne.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend really likes it.</li>
      <li>but it still smells better than the actual cologne and last longer.  </li>
      <li>He has very sensitive skin and loves this one!</li>
      <li>The cost is a little high, but worth the volume and quality for this product.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is decent if your looking for something alcohol free to use for purpose of fragrance but not exceptional.</li>
      <li>Smell is OK but not great.</li>
      <li>It came fast in the mail but the lid was cracked in half and the turning mechanism in the bottom didn&#x27;t work</li>

<li> It came fast in the mail but the lid was cracked in half and the turning mechanism in the bottom didn&#x27;t work</li>
<li> I think it&#x27;s this way because it doesn&#x27;t have nearly the amount of alcohol as the other two.&lt;br</li>
<li> This means it should last a long time.</li>
<li> Once you start pushing the product up, it starts to dry out.  </li>
<li> I use the product and then push it back down to the bottom of the plastic cylinder.  </li>
<li> I suspect no real LC..</li>
<li> Smells bad , no wonder why it&#x27;s cheap</li>
<li> This pushes up from bottom and slides down when I apply.  </li>
<li> The ring/gasket at the push point is not air tight, like a screw-type dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This deodorant is damn near impossible to find locally.</li>
<li> This is one of the few deoderants that doesn&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction when applied and it works quite well for me.</li>
<li> Also was not available for purchase in stores by it self as a stand alone in my area for sometime.</li>
<li> The plastic wrap that is usually on these when I buy from dept store was not in place and scent does not seem correct.  </li>
<li> My husband has used this deodorant for 15yrs plus and it is hard to find now at the Dept. stores.</li>
<li> Awkward to hold it with my finger as I apply.  </li>

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really smell like Curve...but it smells good!!!</li>
    <li> This is a good product but does not adjust by turning the bottom like my earlier purchases.  This pushes up from bottom and slides down when I apply.  Awkward to hold it with my finger as I apply.  Would not buy this one again.</li>
    <li> Love curve deodorant perfect price</li>
    <li> This is one of the few deoderants that doesn&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction when applied and it works quite well for me. I also appreciate the reasonable price. Thanks, Wayne.</li>
    <li> My husband says this is the best deoderant for him due to his sensitive skin..... and what a good price for Liz Claiborne.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my favorite and it&#x27;s keep me cool and smeling fresh all day pull ladies to me asking what Cologne you have on</li>
    <li> My boyfriend really likes it.</li>
    <li> Delivered super fast I love the smell of the deodorant</li>
    <li> I love Curve cologne.  I love Curve deodorant.  You can&#x27;t beat Amazon.com&#x27;s price.  The problem with this product is that it is NOT a twist-up style dispenser.  It is a push-up style.  You may ask, \\&quot;Why does that matter?\\&quot;  Once you start pushing the product up, it starts to dry out.  The ring/gasket at the push point is not air tight, like a screw-type dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is, however, a work-around.  I use the product and then push it back down to the bottom of the plastic cylinder.  The unit stays airtight, that way, and lasts much longer.  Otherwise, the deodorant stick would \\&quot;shrink\\&quot; in the dispenser, eventually disappearing altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only dispenser that I have seen this way and I have tried a lot of \\&quot;foo-foo\\&quot; deodorants.  I use them in place of cologne.  Using the work-around, this product is fantastic.  I am on my third stick.</li>
    <li> The only deodorant my husband can/ will use! He has very sensitive skin and loves this one!</li>
    <li> My husband has used this deodorant for 15yrs plus and it is hard to find now at the Dept. stores.</li>
    <li> Compliments the cologne big time.  I&#x27;ve never had so many compliments on a scent than this.  Seller/transaction was excellent.  Will buy more when I run out, directly from them!</li>
    <li> Smells bad , no wonder why it&#x27;s cheap</li>
    <li> This deodorant is damn near impossible to find locally. Even the stores that used to carry it aren&#x27;t anymore. So I reluctantly ordered it online, which turned out to be pretty painless. The cost is a little high, but worth the volume and quality for this product.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described :)</li>
    <li> The plastic wrap that is usually on these when I buy from dept store was not in place and scent does not seem correct.  I suspect no real LC.. 😔</li>
    <li> It came fast in the mail but the lid was cracked in half and the turning mechanism in the bottom didn&#x27;t work so I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. The container is the same type as a Brut push up type stick but is much better in quality. This was a good purchase at a good price. I also have Brut and Canoe deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes Curve deodorant stand apart is that it does not burn AT ALL when applied. It is thicker and dryer in the container, which is a good thing. This means it should last a long time. I think it&#x27;s this way because it doesn&#x27;t have nearly the amount of alcohol as the other two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good to finally have found a cologne based deodorant that doesn&#x27;t give me a reaction and doesn&#x27;t contain alum. So, no irritation, and no pit stains.</li>
    <li> I was more than happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend. He loves the smell of curve cologne so I thought I&#x27;d buy him the deodorant and he loves it as well. It is a very reasonable price for this product as well. I would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Smell is OK but not great. Remember, this is a deodorant stick, not an anti-perspirant. The fragrance is decent if your looking for something alcohol free to use for purpose of fragrance but not exceptional.</li>
    <li> No comment on the merchandiser but A+ on the customer service end of it.</li>
    <li> Love the cologne Curve by Liz Claiborne so when i saw this i had to get it and its awesome. Smells great and actually lasts longer then i expected. Great item.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Best one we have found that truely controls perspiration for men!👍</li>
    <li> Glad I found this on Amazon because they stopped selling it at the department store. Came with a bunch of coupons for similar items as well. Works for me.</li>
    <li> I think they changed the formula but it still smells better than the actual cologne and last longer.  I use non scented deodorant first and this after.  Liz Claiborne makes a lot of good colognes and I think the Realities deodorant is almost as good as this one.</li>
    <li> This is great if you want to smell like her x-boyfriend.</li>
    <li> Must have for the Curve for Men fan. If you are wearing Curve you will want to add the Curve For Men Daily Deodorant Stick to your routine. The Curve For Men Daily Deodorant Stick 2.6 Oz for some reason did not come with any of the 2012 Christmas gift sets. Also was not available for purchase in stores by it self as a stand alone in my area for sometime. The best online price for this item and is in stock is here on Amazon.</li>
