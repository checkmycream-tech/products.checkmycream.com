      <li>Love this soap!</li>
      <li>This is a nice oatmeal soap that lathers easily and smells great.</li>
      <li>It has a very good smell that is not overpowering and most importantly</li>
      <li>Although, it doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as nice as the Lemon verbena, or Lavender.  </li>
      <li>She likes Oatmeal soaps and she was absolutely thrilled with the cleansing properties as well as the aroma of this soap.  </li>
      <li>I also love the lavender kind :-)</li>
      <li>Even though the listed price on this site is higher than in stores it&#x27;s still a great product to purchase.</li>
      <li>Yardley is great high quality soap, and the price is amazing.</li>
      <li>I want to be free of chemicals and have a good product this is the first one that keeps my skin in good shape.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the fragrance of this soap.  </li>
      <li>Next best thing to Goat Milk Soap.</li>
      <li>however this soap dries out my skin a lot more than the cocoa butter</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this soap.</li>
      <li>and it has given my cabinet a nice light fragrance.</li>
      <li>Still, I guess I can&#x27;t really expect this sort to smell great.  </li>
      <li>Smells great and is gentle.</li>
      <li>Great on my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard Aveeno is good too, but Yardley is cheaper and seems more natural</li>
      <li>Nice smell, gentle exfoliant</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t eat this just enjoy the aroma</li>
      <li>The oatmeal &amp; almond are good for your skin &amp; leave it so soft.</li>
      <li>This Yardley soap is switched up with Tom&#x27;s because I believe it is superior for overall skin health.  </li>
      <li>and this is exactly what i wanted!</li>
      <li>but it is usually available much cheaper at the dollar store.</li>
      <li>The list of ingredients is also quite short, which is always nice to</li>
      <li>I bought this soap because the price was right</li>
      <li>It was delivered in great shape as usual.</li>
      <li>They have little scrub things in them that exfoliate the skin, feels good.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product for dry skin and exfoliating without strong perfume overtones.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other Yardley products (and many other premium brands), and this is just as good as any.  </li>
      <li>Its a nice little luxury....</li>
      <li>None of the soaps with moisturizers or lotions afterwards helped much.</li>
      <li>(ingredient list is much shorter and doesn&#x27;t read like a chemistry text book).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a creamy long lasting bar that easily rinses clean.</li>
      <li>This particular type moistures and cleans very well.  </li>
      <li>It really does a nice job on my skin, but it usually makes me feel like I&#x27;m lathering up with Almond Poppyseed muffins or something.</li>
      <li>: the fragrance seems a bit strong when you first open the package, so we&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s helpful to store any unused open bars in a sealed plastic bag.</li>
      <li>The soap is not harsh on the skin, and my skin can be sensitive when it comes to very fragrant things.</li>
      <li>Finally, a non stinky, no chemicals added soap to replace the discontinued &amp;#34;Dial Pure and Natural&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>After 1 use of 2 bars, I&#x27;ll be back for a large quantity of Yardley.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Lemon Verbena soap, so at least I can buy twice as much of that the next time around.</li>
      <li>My face is sensitive and gets irritated by regular soap bars (major known brands).  </li>
      <li>I really like Yardley soaps on the whole, but there is something about the Oatmeal And Almond variety that I just can&#x27;t get past.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Yardley is great high quality soap, and the price is amazing.</li>
    <li> I swim in a chlorinated pool for 1.5 hrs 3 times a week and had major issues with dry and itchy skin. None of the soaps with moisturizers or lotions afterwards helped much. Started using this and symptoms disappeared almost immediately. I&#x27;ve heard Aveeno is good too, but Yardley is cheaper and seems more natural (ingredient list is much shorter and doesn&#x27;t read like a chemistry text book).</li>
    <li> This is the only soap I use and care to buy. Even though the listed price on this site is higher than in stores it&#x27;s still a great product to purchase.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t eat this just enjoy the aroma</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the soap but it is usually available much cheaper at the dollar store.</li>
    <li> Finally, a non stinky, no chemicals added soap to replace the discontinued &amp;#34;Dial Pure and Natural&amp;#34;.  I have allergies, trust me. Yardley has a scent, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be chemically induced. The &amp;#34;New &amp; Improved&amp;#34; Dial Basic is NOT the same as the discontinued similarly labeled product. After 1 use of 2 bars, I&#x27;ll be back for a large quantity of Yardley.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap because the price was right and I am a fan of Yardley&#x27;s however this soap dries out my skin a lot more than the cocoa butter version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again it cleanses well and each bar lasts a while so that is a plus but I was disappointed a bit after trying the cocoa butter version.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other Yardley products (and many other premium brands), and this is just as good as any.  This particular type moistures and cleans very well.  Although, it doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as nice as the Lemon verbena, or Lavender.  Still, I guess I can&#x27;t really expect this sort to smell great.  It does what it is intended to do, and does it well.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, gentle exfoliant</li>
    <li> I really like Yardley soaps on the whole, but there is something about the Oatmeal And Almond variety that I just can&#x27;t get past. It really does a nice job on my skin, but it usually makes me feel like I&#x27;m lathering up with Almond Poppyseed muffins or something. I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Lemon Verbena soap, so at least I can buy twice as much of that the next time around.</li>
    <li> This is a nice oatmeal soap that lathers easily and smells great. The list of ingredients is also quite short, which is always nice to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helpful tip: the fragrance seems a bit strong when you first open the package, so we&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s helpful to store any unused open bars in a sealed plastic bag.</li>
    <li> I love this soap! Smells great and is gentle.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for a friend.  She likes Oatmeal soaps and she was absolutely thrilled with the cleansing properties as well as the aroma of this soap.  I would recommend this product to anyone who likes specialized soaps.</li>
    <li> I want to be free of chemicals and have a good product this is the first one that keeps my skin in good shape. It was delivered in great shape as usual.</li>
    <li> Love this soap! Great on my sensitive skin. Next best thing to Goat Milk Soap. I also love the lavender kind :-)</li>
    <li> Fantastic product for dry skin and exfoliating without strong perfume overtones. Even if you&#x27;re sensitive due to allergies, this product is non-irritating.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this soap. Its a nice little luxury....</li>
    <li> LOVE this soap! was looking for a similar soap i used on vacation and this is exactly what i wanted!</li>
    <li> Initially I bought the Yardley soap from Walmart, however they stopped selling it.  I checked Amazon and of course they had it at a very good price. My face is sensitive and gets irritated by regular soap bars (major known brands).  It has a very good smell that is not overpowering and most importantly, it does the job without irritating my skin.  This is the only soap I use now for bathing.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the fragrance of this soap.  It&#x27;s a creamy long lasting bar that easily rinses clean. The oatmeal &amp; almond are good for your skin &amp; leave it so soft.</li>
    <li> Smooth lather and incredible almond scent!</li>
    <li> This soap smells really good, I have one bar that is in my cabinet waiting to be used and it has given my cabinet a nice light fragrance. The soap is not harsh on the skin, and my skin can be sensitive when it comes to very fragrant things. They have little scrub things in them that exfoliate the skin, feels good. I&#x27;ve had no problems with it</li>
    <li> this soap helps to keep me from getting dry skin an itching and rashes.  Keep &#x27;em cummin they work great</li>
    <li> This Yardley soap is switched up with Tom&#x27;s because I believe it is superior for overall skin health.  It has Oatmeal in it which has been and ingredient that helps to sooth itchy dry skin.  The formulation has been around for a long time and works well.</li>
