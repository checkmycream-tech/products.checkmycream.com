    <li> Works as presented, though a bit pricey for what you get.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my eye doctor for use with reading glasses. The price is crazy [just not as crazy as trying to buy it in a CVS] being that the main ingredient it basically water and antifreeze (yes, you read that correctly, don&#x27;t ingest it). That said, it makes my eyes nice and lubed and very comfortable. Literally your most important body parts, your eyes don&#x27;t get much love, so treat them to a nice drop of this and you&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>

    <li> These drops recommended by my Optomotrist over other brands for people like me, light eyes, living in a dry environment.  Lubricates &amp; soothes tired dry eyes; although it does not take the red away, nor is it engineered to do that.</li>

    <li> I bought this brand of eye lubricant at the recommendation of my ophthalmologist during my most recent exam where it indicated that I am not producing enough tear drops to satisfy the needs of my eyes.
