      <li>I have medium fine hair and it helps to build some body!</li>
      <li>I love this brush.  </li>
      <li>Moreover the color is so much more cooler than it is shown in the picture here.</li>
      <li>Am so glad that I did because my hair has never, ever been more manageable, more silky and no flyaways.  </li>
      <li>would recommend this brush for sure.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well over 3&amp;#34; diamerer and PERFECT for long hair.</li>
      <li>Awesome brush - works as advertised to create a quick hair dry experience with volume.. Never have used another brush (saw that this was highly recommended by youtubers etc), but I won&#x27;t need to try - really happy with this.</li>
      <li>This brush is so easy to manage</li>
      <li>I have shoulder length, fine hair.  </li>
      <li>This thing is huge.</li>
      <li>She is a hairstylist who said that no brush had ever gone through her hair so smoothly.</li>
      <li>This brush, combined with my dryer and using Aveda&#x27;s \\&quot;Smooth</li>
      <li>light weight</li>
      <li>This is the best round brush ever, the others here are going in the garbage.  </li>
      <li>Because snags and tangles were the main reason I had never bothered to round brush my own hair, I decided to try this out based on her awesome review- and let me say she was so right!</li>
      <li>I like this brush very much; and believe me, I have purchased many without even using them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but I was pretty satisfied with the first-time results.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super comfortable to hold and lightweight, too.</li>
      <li>The handle is soft with a nice grip</li>
      <li>I tried it today for the first time and was amazed how easily it glided through my hair.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s very pretty because of the color.</li>
      <li>( Very very hot).</li>
      <li>The second reason why i absolutely love this brush is when you are trying to roll it over and over to straighten you hair, it gives your hair a smooth and silky shine as it gets very hot.</li>
      <li>but I hope it&#x27;ll be worth it.</li>
      <li>The price is steep, but worth it....</li>
      <li>The brush gives you a nice grip which is really very essential when you are trying to straighten your hair using a blow dryer.</li>
      <li>Infusions\\&quot; styling products, I can blow out my hair and end up with beautiful results--I can&#x27;t remember the last time I picked up my flat iron!</li>
      <li>I love that the barrel is so big; it helps me blow my hair out much faster.  </li>
      <li>I love this brush, it grabs the hair just right unlike other brushes.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>and I really like the volume it brings to my hairstyle.</li>
      <li>It seems SO much better than the other brushes I had used.</li>
      <li>It is perfect for long hair and definitely gave my hair body when I blow dried my hair.</li>
      <li>Because of the way it&#x27;s made it drys my hair so fast, it&#x27;s cut my time down for sure.  </li>
      <li>I recently took a huge plunge and got a completely new hairstyle.</li>
      <li>and I even got a nice little unexpected gift from the shipper.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this brush.</li>
      <li>I would give it 4 stars because the price seemed high for a hairbrush</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to round brush my hair.</li>
      <li>So easy to use, and I&#x27;ve always had issues styling my hair with a round brush.</li>
      <li>The brush is just what I want, The seller described the products as it is, and the international shipping was fast</li>
      <li>This is a decent brush, but I wish it was a bit smaller.  </li>
      <li>I watched a few youtube vids on round brushing and this brush seemed to be a favorite.</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t get tired and the top portion is big</li>
      <li>I have very fine, fluffy hair that is very difficult to style and tangles easily.</li>
      <li>A little pricey on here, you can get the same brush at Ulta much cheaper.</li>

<li> After looking in stores for ages to find a round brush that was bigger then 2.5&amp;#34; inches diameter, i finally found this one online.</li>

<li> I have recommended this brush to many friends, and hope you decide to try it out for yourself- you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
<li> I thought the bristles might be uncomfortable but the actually are not - does not tanlge my shoulder length hair and works like a charm!</li>
<li> so I have to use blow dryers with mega-heat (I recently discovered FHI which has become a holy grail beauty item for me), and was always frustrated that within a few minutes the bristles on other brushes would get too soft, making it difficult to grab the hair (difficult to explain--</li>
<li> hopefully you know what I mean).  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s the brush, itself, that is expensive</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This brush is so easy to manage I sometimes feel like a hair stylist. I think the reason why is the handle has a grip that makes your hair easy to roll! My hair looks bouncy after blow drying. The price is steep, but worth it.... Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Awesome brush - works as advertised to create a quick hair dry experience with volume.. Never have used another brush (saw that this was highly recommended by youtubers etc), but I won&#x27;t need to try - really happy with this.</li>
    <li> The brush works great. A little pricey on here, you can get the same brush at Ulta much cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have had this brush now for about 2 yrs and I must say&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s the one I reach for all time.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this brush for sure.</li>
    <li> The brush is just what I want, The seller described the products as it is, and the international shipping was fast</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been months now but I wanted to wait awhile before writing a review. I love this brush.  It&#x27;s the perfect size handle, light weight so you don&#x27;t get tired and the top portion is big so you can do big chunks of hair at a time.  Because of the way it&#x27;s made it drys my hair so fast, it&#x27;s cut my time down for sure.  And best of all, the bristles haven&#x27;t damaged.  They aren&#x27;t falling out or bending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great brush and I plan on buying one for my sister.</li>
    <li> This brush has improved the look of my hair dramatically.  Get it, learn how to use it, rock it.  The handle is soft with a nice grip and I really like the volume it brings to my hairstyle.</li>
    <li> I have never had a brush that didn&#x27;t have my long hair constantly get tangled up.  This brush is amazing, hair holds with out getting stuck, and it gives you awesome volume!!  I would recommend to everyone!!  I told my sister about it and she bought one too, she loves it as well!!!</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length, fine hair.  This is a decent brush, but I wish it was a bit smaller.  This thing is huge.</li>
    <li> The brush came on time and I even got a nice little unexpected gift from the shipper. I give them 5 stars for the service! I would give it 4 stars because the price seemed high for a hairbrush but it&#x27;s the about the same price from other sellers too. It&#x27;s the brush, itself, that is expensive but I hope it&#x27;ll be worth it. I woke up this morning and went to accept the package at the door. I opened up the box and took the brush out to test it. I didn&#x27;t comb my hair or anything and when I ran the brush through my hair, it barely got tangled (just very little because of course I had morning hair). It seems SO much better than the other brushes I had used. And it&#x27;s very pretty because of the color. The handle is also rubbery and nice.</li>
    <li> This is the best round brush ever, the others here are going in the garbage.  So easy to use, and I&#x27;ve always had issues styling my hair with a round brush.</li>
    <li> I thought the bristles might be uncomfortable but the actually are not - does not tanlge my shoulder length hair and works like a charm!</li>
    <li> Excellent. Grabs all ur hair. Even my non-dexterous self can now round brush my hair. Only caviat is the rubber handle sometimes snags your hair too.</li>
    <li> I love this brush, it grabs the hair just right unlike other brushes. It&#x27;s super comfortable to hold and lightweight, too. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush after watching a tutorial for round-brushing your hair by LolaMarie7 (youtube). She is a hairstylist who said that no brush had ever gone through her hair so smoothly. Because snags and tangles were the main reason I had never bothered to round brush my own hair, I decided to try this out based on her awesome review- and let me say she was so right! I have naturally frizzy, wavy hair and with this brush it completely eliminated frizz, and cuts down my straightening routine to less than 5 minutes of touchups after drying. Also, this brush is great for giving volume and body from root to tip, and you don&#x27;t have to be a professional to get great results. I have recommended this brush to many friends, and hope you decide to try it out for yourself- you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Amazing brush&lt;br /&gt;My hair is long and thick and this is the only brush that works for me</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s just say that I USED to have frizzy, flyaway hair.  Not anymore with this brush....I would give it 1,000 Stars if I could.  I watched Lola Marie 7 on You Tube and she styled her hair with this brush.  Loved the results she had, so thought I would give it a try.  Am so glad that I did because my hair has never, ever been more manageable, more silky and no flyaways.  I recommend this brush to everyone.  If you have any doubts, watch Lola Marie&#x27;s video and I think your mind will be changed and you will be happy you made the purchase!</li>
    <li> I like this brush very much; and believe me, I have purchased many without even using them.&lt;br /&gt;I wish they would make this brush a little bigger for long hair.  It is still the best brush I own.</li>
    <li> I have extremely coarse/thick/unruly/curly hair so I have to use blow dryers with mega-heat (I recently discovered FHI which has become a holy grail beauty item for me), and was always frustrated that within a few minutes the bristles on other brushes would get too soft, making it difficult to grab the hair (difficult to explain--hopefully you know what I mean).  But with this brush, that doesn&#x27;t happen at all!  I love that the barrel is so big; it helps me blow my hair out much faster.  This brush, combined with my dryer and using Aveda&#x27;s \\&quot;Smooth Infusions\\&quot; styling products, I can blow out my hair and end up with beautiful results--I can&#x27;t remember the last time I picked up my flat iron!</li>
    <li> I saw this brush in one of the youtube tutorials.  It is perfect for long hair and definitely gave my hair body when I blow dried my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to round brush my hair. I have very fine, fluffy hair that is very difficult to style and tangles easily. I recently took a huge plunge and got a completely new hairstyle. I now have medium-short hair with lots of layers. I watched a few youtube vids on round brushing and this brush seemed to be a favorite. I tried it today for the first time and was amazed how easily it glided through my hair. It will take some practice getting the perfect style but I was pretty satisfied with the first-time results.</li>
    <li> I Bought this jumbo brush after watching a video on youtube. I Must say I made a good decision of buying it. The brush gives you a nice grip which is really very essential when you are trying to straighten your hair using a blow dryer. The second reason why i absolutely love this brush is when you are trying to roll it over and over to straighten you hair, it gives your hair a smooth and silky shine as it gets very hot. ( Very very hot). Moreover the color is so much more cooler than it is shown in the picture here. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I still have this brush and use it almost every day!  I have medium fine hair and it helps to build some body!</li>
    <li> After looking in stores for ages to find a round brush that was bigger then 2.5&amp;#34; inches diameter, i finally found this one online. At first i was reluctant, because the listing fails to mention how big the brush is, aside from &#x27;jumbo&#x27;. When i opened the box i was delighted. It&#x27;s well over 3&amp;#34; diamerer and PERFECT for long hair. Gave me the sort of volume i was looking for, and cut down my daily hair ritual by over 20 minutes. The design is stirdy, and the grip is excellent. it doesnt snag on your hair, so its very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this brush.</li>
