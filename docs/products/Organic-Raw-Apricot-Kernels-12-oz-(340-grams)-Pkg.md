      <li>The delivery was very fast and I am satisfied with the entire sale.</li>
      <li>10 pounds first month; have helped lose belly fat in three months.  </li>
      <li>know of no scientific studies supporting those claims.</li>
      <li>Experience has taught us that unless you can handle the very bitter taste of these its best to take with some other form of food.</li>
      <li>easily, but not bitter if chewed&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fresh and high quality</li>

      <li>If the taste is too strong, I would also recommend chopping and mixing into other foods.  </li>
      <li>We came up with a great way to consume these without making you wince over the bitterness - buy a bag (or more) of organic, raw dried apricots (without sulfites or other additives) and take one of these with a kernel and chew it that way.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Meets all expectations</li>
    <li> These seeds came packaged fine, timely, and as advertised, but were not strong enough. The seeds I was looking for needed the bite and after taste that showed they were full of the edible form of cyanide (B17). Probably not the seller&#x27;s fault, but I was disappointed. These seeds tasted like almonds. If that is what you are looking for, then I recommend these.</li>
    <li> Purchased two bags of these - 2 pounds each. It&#x27;s something like 1500 kernels per bag.  The packaging what very professional looking - sealed fresh. Once opened it has a ziplock press n seal thing to keep the bag closed.  My wife and i take these up to 5 per day. Experience has taught us that unless you can handle the very bitter taste of these its best to take with some other form of food. You can also grind these in a coffee grinder which we&#x27;ve done and then sprinkle over salad, pasta or what have you.  We came up with a great way to consume these without making you wince over the bitterness - buy a bag (or more) of organic, raw dried apricots (without sulfites or other additives) and take one of these with a kernel and chew it that way. Its like putting the kernel back in the apricot. Makes it a lot easier to eat the kernel if you are eating it whole and taste great that way.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t taste especially good, but not bad, either.  After reading A World Without Cancer, by G. Edward Griffin, I will probably eat these every day for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> These seeds aren&#x27;t that bad tasteing. I&#x27;m not sure what people are talking about when they say these seeds are so bitter.   I think they taste as good as a seed should taste, and as for working well only time will tell.</li>
    <li> Nice resealable package and doesn&#x27;t taste bad.  Fresh quality product from one of the ----istan nations.  Only 8 per day recommended on the package.  G.W. Griffith&#x27;s book, \\&quot;World Without Cancer\\&quot; is a must read to understand how this naturally occurring B-17 can kill cancer cells.</li>
    <li> Why do you want apricot kernels? If you want to lower your blood pressure, have a healthy snack... Swanson kernels are fine for that. If you want kernels to treat cancer you need Apricot Power kernels. Apricot Power kernels are very bitter compared to Swanson&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Apricot nuts are a very valuable part to a nutritious diet.  However in the Midwest they are nearly impossible to find.  These nuts are very high quality and were a great find for my wife and I.  If you can&#x27;t find them locally, I would highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> They call them \\&quot;bitter almonds\\&quot; but to me they just tasted like nuts, not bitter at all, just like a generic nut.  I eat several in the AM and several in the PM. Amazon had the best pricing that I found. I hope they keep me cancer free.</li>
    <li> I bought these because of their cancer fighting properties and over all they don&#x27;t taste bad either so I pop about 4 every other day for the taste and for the hope that they are doing what I purchased them for.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I was told that the seeds contained a compound called amygdalin that could fight cancer and was like laetrile. I was eating about 7 seeds a day and after about 3 weeks my bones were aching and I couldn&#x27;t get a good breath. After further researching, I found that amygdalin breaks down to cyanide in your system and I was sufferring from cyanide poisoning.  I have been getting steadily better since I discontinued using the seeds. Otherwise, they were fresh and well packaged, so your experience my not be like mine, but when fighting cancer you have to pick your poison apparently.</li>
    <li> The apricot kernels are delicious. I don&#x27;t eat many a day but it makes me feel good knowing there is a source where to buy them. The packaging is very well done so that the kernels retain their freshness.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Known as one of the fighters in the tratment for Cancer tispoduct is great suppliment of the little known Vitamin B17. Do your research and don&#x27;t hesitate to include it to your diet</li>
    <li> Swanson has purchased these from another country.  Says right on the package.  They have NO BITTER at all and are merely an almond taste.  The medicinal property you are looking for is NOT IN THESE at all.  I returned them.  A waste of your time and money.</li>
    <li> Question:&lt;br /&gt;Do You Need Vitamin B17?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 55 and wonder if taking vitamin B17 would be a good idea, and if so how often and what dose?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Answer:&lt;br /&gt;Answer (Published 10/1/2009)&lt;br /&gt;There is no vitamin B17. The term is inaccurately applied to laetrile, a discredited cancer drug, and amygdalin, the natural substance from which laetrile is made. Amygdalin occurs in the seeds of apricot, peaches, and almonds. Despite the lack of proof that laetrile/amygdalin works, promoters have continued to make unwarranted claims for it, referring to it as vitamin B17 and selling it as a dietary supplement to prevent, as well as treat, cancer. I&#x27;ve also seen promotions that claim these compounds can prevent and treat high blood pressure and arthritis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know of no scientific studies supporting those claims. One laetrile-related theory holds that cancer is a vitamin deficiency and that the missing vitamin is B17. That is nonsense. To fit the accepted scientific definition of a vitamin, a substance must be proven to be essential to achieving or maintaining good health. There is no need for amygdalin or laetrile in human nutrition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, instead of helping you, it may hurt you: laetrile and amygdalin can be converted to cyanide in the body, and laetrile use has been linked to several cases of cyanide toxicity. According to the American Cancer Society (ACS) one case report suggests that vitamin C may increase the amount of cyanide released from laetrile in the body, raising this risk. In addition, the ACS warns that individuals who also eat raw almonds or crushed fruit pits while taking laetrile and those who eat fruits and vegetables that contain the enzyme beta-glucosidase (such as celery, peaches, bean sprouts, and carrots) are more likely to experience toxicity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need \\&quot;vitamin B17\\&quot; to prevent cancer, to treat cancer or to prevent any other health problem, and you certainly don&#x27;t need it to maintain good health. Avoid it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrew Weil, M.D.</li>
    <li> great product!!! people do not realize how valuable these seeds can be for health. I highly recommend this product for anyone!</li>
    <li> Apricot kernels do not taste very good, but they contain a supplement known as B17, which has been known to cure cancer.  I gave them to a friend with cancer.  Since she has been eating 7 a day along with taking the supplement in pill form, the doctors cannot find anymore cancer.  She also did 2 chemo sessions during this time, but was not able to finish chemo due to an allergic reaction to it.  This leads me to believe that the rumors are true...  B17 does kill cancer and you can get it through eating apricot kernels.  If the taste is too strong, I would also recommend chopping and mixing into other foods.  The package arrived promptly and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I´ve ordered these Apricot Kernels because they are organic. I was used to eating non-organic kernels and they are very bitter. These organic ones aren&#x27;t. It tastes like raw almonds. Very interesting. I&#x27;d prefer they were bitter, but I think it&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
    <li> I use B17 to fight my dogs Cancer. Tumors shrink when given b17 and then grow back once off the b17. More research is needed but many testify the praises of B17.</li>
    <li> Very convenient...&lt;br /&gt;very clean, uniform kernels&lt;br /&gt;crush easily, but not bitter if chewed&lt;br /&gt;nice resealable pkg that is freezer ready&lt;br /&gt;nice price</li>
    <li> This product was exactly as I expected.  The two bags came individually vacuum-sealed with resealable pouch for convenience.  I bought these as a health boost to my daily diet.  They are not the tastiest seeds in the world but if eaten with raisins, I find they take on an almost almond flavor.  This was the best value I saw for these seeds.</li>
    <li> I WAS A BIT DISAPPOINTED AS I EXPECTED THE KERNALS TO BE BITTER AND NOT FLAT AS THEY TURNED OUT TO BE.</li>
    <li> Good quality, exactly as advertised.  I toss them in my nutria-bullet when I make smoothies.  Supposed to help with Cancer prevention.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my dad who has cancer, but later read that the bitter ones are better for cancer fighting purposes.</li>
    <li> Everyone complains about the kernels being so sour. Maybe the organic causes&lt;br /&gt;it to be nutty.  That is how it tastes to me.  I have been on an alkaline diet&lt;br /&gt;for awhile, so my tastebuds are different now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is helping with the purpose ( illness) I bought it for.</li>
    <li> Impossible to evaluate</li>
    <li> great product, should be available in grocery stores though</li>
    <li> A few tasted a little funny so far. Others were good. Some may have been a little rancid or something.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery,  Great product i would buy from seller again. Organic raw apricot kernels taste great. I heard many people say they dont like them i LOVE them. and take  8/ day to help keep cancer away. along with eating organic food. maybe i am paranoid becauase of so much cancer in my family. but this gives me a bit of piece of mind</li>
    <li> Organic Raw Apricot Kernels contain vitamin B-17, aka: Laetrile, which is a cancer preventative.  I use them in smoothies and they taste good too if munched on separately.  For more on cancer preventatives, there&#x27;s a good movie out called &amp;#34;A World Without Cancer&amp;#34; which may be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;QeYMduufa-E</li>
    <li> Took some to get used to the taste but I felt they added better nutrition to my diet</li>
    <li> It was delivered according to specifications.</li>
    <li> I have ordered the organic apricot kernels. Proper research and understanding will dispel fears and knee jerk reaction about the cyanide component. Cyanide is used in table salt, fish industry and pesticides. So unwarranted fear is unnecessary. Unless someone eats way too many, it should not affect anyone. More people die of drug overdose such as taking aspirin and acetaminophen and than over consumption of food naturally made for us to consume and possibly heal naturally. Ironically organic also takes care of pesticides problem.</li>
    <li> love it i would buy it again i am going to buy it when i run out try it you will like it</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for, it arrived quickly and without damage. For some reason it is very rare to find in stores.</li>
    <li> This product tastes great, looks great and is an excellent source of vitamin B-17. I like it so much that I am going to order more for me and some of my friends.</li>
    <li> The are very fresh, good taste. I have LCM and my doctor said to eat them help to get better the blood</li>
    <li> So far, so good! Will keep purchasing these from this seller! Still cancer free! I do believe in these kernels and hope that other people fighting this disease will give them a try.</li>
    <li> Its amazing what we are told as little ones growing up and then find out all along that they really are good for you.</li>
    <li> A little bitter but with it.</li>
    <li> Make sure when you purchase apricot kernels, it says BITTER. I was too excited when I placed my oder and didn&#x27;t realize this product is not bitter apricot kernels. They are tasty and they have good delivery time.</li>
    <li> Fresh and high quality</li>
    <li> Truly good tasting kernels--better than most!  Have used other brands, but decided to try Swanson&#x27;s.  Have been quite pleasantly surprised that the usual bitter taste of apricot kernels is not characteristic of these.  Maybe has something to do with country/region of origin (Uzbekistan in this case).  Wow, what a marked difference.  Sure hope the therapeutic value is as good as with others that are bitterer than these.  Hope the great taste is not an indication of lesser medicinal value.  They are really smooth, like a savory nut.</li>
    <li> Our diets do not contain enough bitter items to balance the deluge of sugar that is included in so many food products. These apricot kernels are delicious and nutricious.  I will be reordering!</li>
    <li> If the apricot seeds you are eating are not bitter they do not contain enough of the vitamin B17 to prevent or treat cancer. I have sourced this information on a few different websites while searching for a cure for my mothers cancer.</li>
    <li> NOT BITTER -  I DONT THINK THERE IS B17 IN THESE AS  SOMETHING WAS DONE TO THEM TO MAKE THEM NOT BITTER ANY MORE.  JUST TASTES LIKE ALMONDS.  NO BITTERNESS AT ALL.</li>
    <li> I liked the taste of the apricot seeds compared to others I have tried.  The delivery was very fast and I am satisfied with the entire sale.</li>
    <li> Purchased these seeds for their cancer prevention benefit.  I encourage you to watch a youtube documentary called A World Without Cancer by G. Edward Griffin.  His research found cultures and societies whose diets rich in b17 DO NOT HAVE CANCER!  Organic, raw apricot kernals are HIGH in B17.  I don&#x27;t have cancer, but taking these for prevention.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what the negative reviews are about, they taste almost the same as this brand  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;rRhaMlOL2rc  which are now.  http://www.amazon.com/Bitter-Raw-Apricot-Kernels-Bag/dp/B0018OE2II%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJJKNAF6N4IWXALPQ%26tag%3Dhotocufl08-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB0018OE2II</li>
    <li> I grew up eating these. I still eat them everyday. So I know what good and bad apricot pits are.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like this particular product at all.&lt;br /&gt;Here are some pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;-Price is competitive with other Amazon sellers.&lt;br /&gt;-Packaging. It comes in a nice resealable bag.&lt;br /&gt;-USDA certified organic.&lt;br /&gt;-They were not bitter. Some apricot seeds/kernels can be quite bitter and not pleasant to eat. These had none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;-There were quite the number (15-20) of seeds/kernels that were dirty. They had actual dirt/sand on them.&lt;br /&gt;-They seemed damp. In Uzbekistan (it is claimed that these come from Uzbekistan) merchants will leave nuts and grains in a humid room so that the products absorb humidity. This makes the product heavier. They make more money this way. However this changes the product&#x27;s taste and is also not good. It can lead to mold and other fungus growing. A good apricot seeds/kernels are dried in the sun for extensive period of time so that they dry very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last point I mentioned made me not enjoy these at all. That is why i gave it only 1 star.</li>
    <li> this product was horrible.  This apricot seeds does not taste right.  Something is definitely wrong. Do not buy you will be wasting your money</li>
    <li> these came in good condition.  however, they are not bitter apricot kernels thus of no use to me as cancer preventive.  didn&#x27;t research properly before ordering.</li>
    <li> There are stories all over the internet about how Apricot Kernels contain naturally occurring levels of cyanide. If you eat enough, you&#x27;ll get cyanide poisoning. The packaging on this product even states that you should not exceed 8 kernels per day but they do not explain why. Please don&#x27;t buy this product. Do research before you start buying something and taking it because you assume it&#x27;s healthy.    [...]</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, and they are very tasty!  I&#x27;ve shared them with several friends and all but one loved them too!</li>
    <li> This is my second order of this product. They are used as a healthful snack and are of outstanding quality. Definitely a recommend.</li>
    <li> super great, pulverize them in a blender, add fruit, plenty of vit b-17.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this product.Good snack,healthy for whole family.I recommend this organic apricot kernels to every body for good source of vitamin B17.</li>
    <li> THESE SEEDS ARE SWEET!!! IF YOU&#x27;RE LOOKING FOR BITTER SEEDS - LOOK ELSEWHERE!!! Packaging was perfect. Nice heavy duty bag with a zip lock - feels nice and sturdy. They taste a lot like almonds, very pleasant taste. Was looking for bitter seeds (should have read the reviews).</li>
    <li> I had been using raw apricot seeds from another source for years, but when I found this product at this price (about 1/2 the price I was paying) I couldn&#x27;t resist.  Immediately I noticed a brittle, crunchy texture like they were toasted or freeze-dried (both of which will destroy the B17).  The package clearly states \\&quot;raw\\&quot;, which I suppose, however deceptively, does not exclude freeze-drying.  And after  popping the usual 7 kernels in my mouth, I braced myself for the wave of bitterness.  It never came.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad I ordered 2 packages.  I am using 9-10 instead of 7 until these are gone.  I am too suspicious to reorder.</li>
    <li> The Organic Raw Apricot Kernels are great and as advertised.  They are being used to help my metabolism system.  I&#x27;\ve ben taking them a couple weeks now.  Great so far.&lt;br /&gt;Lost 10 pounds first month; have helped lose belly fat in three months.  So yes, great.</li>
    <li> After eating apricot seeds that I personally had cracked open from the shells, or kernels last summer.  These are very weak.  Not near as bitter as they claim.  Not as potent, either.  I&#x27;ve also read that it is best to take the seeds along with the fruit they came from.  That seems to work better,too.</li>
