<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The item is great, and was well represented in the photo.&lt;br /&gt;However, it took a very long time to arrive. I sent the seller a message, a second one was sent; The item took about 45 days to arrive from China.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend the product, if you have time to wait.</li>
    <li> Terrible.  VERY disappointed.  Comes from China, and looks like it.  When it arrived I did not recognize it as anything I had bought.  Went thru orders &amp; found it.  Really fooled me.  Sucker born every day!  Will return unless Wife wants for something, which will surprise me.  Thought she could put magazines in it for travel, based solely on picture.  It is far too small for that.</li>
    <li> not very good quality</li>
    <li> This handbag organizer is wonderful!!  I&#x27;m still getting used to the fact that I don&#x27;t have to carry a thousand separate things in my purse.  This organizer is an ideal size and hold so many, many necessary things!!</li>
    <li> I like it and am using it.Lots of pockets and flexible, not hard shelled like my previous purchase. I like the handles.</li>
    <li> This organizer has lots of pockets and zipper compartments. The size is perfect to put into totes. The price was great but shipping was slow.</li>
    <li> Easy to see inside a dark pocketbook&lt;br /&gt;Holds many sizes of items&lt;br /&gt;Best value for the $$;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend it&lt;br /&gt;Have purchased as gift</li>
    <li> Even though one of the handles was not securely sewed on to the pouch, it is basically well made (I can fix the handle).  The yellow zippers secure to large pockets, and there are plenty of pockets for everything else I need.  My overstuffed wallet fits in the center of the pouch and there is still room for additional items.  It is lightweight and fits well in the purse I am currently using.  I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I like this, but it isn&#x27;t something I would gift. One of the seams was coming apart on arrival. So, I can use it, but wouldn&#x27;t want to give it to anyone because it&#x27;s kinda cheap. But hey, the price was cheap!</li>
    <li> Will work well in a handbag without compartments.  Will keep bag organized and make for easy access to contents. Great!!</li>
    <li> I waited 10 days or so to receive what looked like a great product. It had plenty of room to expand, fit in my purse and tote nicely, and generally did well. While traveling in Texas, I placed my wallet in the middle area. When I removed the organizer from my bag, I noticed a huge rip in it. Bizarrely, another pocket was also torn. For gentle use, this probably does the job just fine. I might get another one but be more careful when traveling.</li>
    <li> This works very well.  Has lots of organizing areas and very sturdy zippers.  Very spacious and is perfect for my needs</li>
    <li> This is handy to put in a purse so you can retrieve your items that may fall down inside of your purse.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price. Ended up ordering another one for a gift. I was very impressed.</li>
    <li> Though it is cheap, the quality is good. The bag even has padding. It is big enough to hold all my baby items so that I have more room in my bag to put my own stuff! A good buy.</li>
    <li> Very handy to use lots of pockets and much easier to find stuff in my purse. Shipping took forever about three weeks to get it.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this I thought it was a hard shell or rigid. It is cloth. It doesn&#x27;t seem to hold stuff as well as in the picture because unless you have it stuffed full it does not stand up like the pic. But I am using it and it does help a little with the mess in my purse. Just wish I had read the description better before I ordered.</li>
    <li> I am using all my purses now. I was lazy to change my staff before but now it is very easy!</li>
    <li> I love the &amp;#34;hobo&amp;#34; type bags but I hated how I could never find anything because everything ended up in a jumbled mess.  This organizer was exactly what I need to keep everything in place so I can find it easily.  I was worried it would be too small or too big but it is the perfect size.  My wallet fits in the large middle section.  There are plenty of small pockets to organize lipstick, nail clippers, pens, etc.  There are two zippered side pockets that I put coupons and person feminine products.  The organizer lifts out of my purse easily so I can transfer it to another purse quickly without worrying about reorganizing.  I highly recommend this purse organizer.</li>
    <li> In my larger purses I am always &amp;#34;digging&amp;#34; for items such as ink pens and lipsticks. No more! This organizer will help greatly with that problem. I can still carry my large purses that allow me to carry notebooks if necessary.</li>
    <li> I loved the bag until the zipper broke. I was very disappointed it was just what I needed. I only used it for a week.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t last more than 2 days....it got unstitched all over. It looked promising, but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I make purses that can fold flat for travel. These pouches do the trick for inserts. I bought them several times because they work so well with my craft. The zippers are bright yellow which is not so attractive, but its inside the bag so it works. I did have one come to me with the lining not attached properly and I had to mend it.</li>
    <li> This made a bigger mess of my purse. There is no way to secure it inside the purse so it just bounces around.  I have a &amp;#34;bucket purse&amp;#34;.  It might work better in a smaller purse.</li>
    <li> Great quality, multiple pockets, fits most of the purses, this is a real must have if you like to keep your things organized and want to be fashioned and often change your purse!</li>
    <li> Very nice buy! Everything fits in this cute bag. Highly recommend it and would buy another one if needed. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I was ALWAYS loosing my keys and smaller items into the BLACK HOLE that is my pocketbook.  As a fulltime working mother, I have to have everything accessible at all times and this little beauty helps me keep it organized!  a MUST have!</li>
    <li> This little organizer is perfect for my little bag. It organizes my bag and makes sure I don&#x27;t leave anything important behind when I switch purses. Really like it and on top of that it arrived 12 days earlier than expected!</li>
    <li> Was just what I wanted. I hate these comment sections that REQUIREyou to use a specifir characters or it won&#x27;t take your comments and it also requires you to make a comment or it won&#x27;t take your stat rating. That is why I stopped doing ratings.</li>
    <li> This is one of the greatest products.  The outside zippers on the insert are great for storing larger items.  The side slip pockets hold all I need to carry. This is truly a well designed product that functions very well.</li>
    <li> love my purse organizer, thanks.&lt;br /&gt;fits my needs perfectly.  can fit my cell, datebook, kindle, checkbook, wallet, small notepad, pens and so much more. love it</li>
    <li> I love this little bag insert.  It was just what I needed.  Very well made.</li>
    <li> the pictures show that ipad or galaxy note will fit in the middle opening.... maybe 7&amp;#34; one might fit.  but my 10.1 galaxy note with cover will not fit in the middle as shown in pictures.  But I like all the side pockets.</li>
    <li> I am constanly changing my bag so this helped to make the transfer easiler and faster. Only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t fit all of my bags due to the make of the bag, but overall wonderful.</li>
    <li> I would suggest this to anyone who carries everything in their pocketbook. I fit everything in there and still have room for more...Its an organizer within a organizer...I am very pleased....</li>
    <li> I like this organizer but one of the zippers want zip all the way.The  color is good ,you can put a lot of stuff in this!</li>
    <li> Hated it! Took almost a month to receive, and when i did finally receive it in the mail the zipper on one side was already broken, and less than a few hours later the zipper on the other side was broken. Could barely fit anything comfortably, flimsy. I threw it out the next day.</li>
    <li> This item does what I need--it holds everything in my purse for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The zipper sticks, but I still like it. I&#x27;ll use it more when I&#x27;m in school and changing out bags more regularly. Worth it for such a low price.</li>
    <li> I love this purse organizer.  It is the perfect size.  I switch handbags often and it is so easy to pull out and put in another bag!</li>
    <li> I travel every weekend and use this as a makeup bag rather than a purse organizer. It&#x27;s big and the multiple compartments allow me to keep everything organized. I like that it&#x27;s washable too.</li>
    <li> will recommend, for good origanization,to keept all things its proper place,without having to dig and scramble thur all of you belongings</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t argue with the price I paid.  I had one similar that didn&#x27;t have as much space.  This works great.</li>
    <li> I got this &amp; loaded it (not heavy!) for our first outing together and one of the yellow slim section zippers had already pulled free - more than coming unstitched-- it had torn a bit, making the loop handle attached to it impractical for pulling it out of a handbag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Multiple sections to really keep things sorted and the padding works well to help insulate when you have to keep something cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Quality can be hit or miss and the padding, while adding body, adds weightless bulk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t spend that much and almost ordered two at once- glad I bought just one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience wasn&#x27;t so bad as to deter me from considering purchasing something similar again, but I&#x27;d do it with the understanding that I may need to throw a few stitches in it or add a little duct tape reinforcement.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something that I can transfer from handbag (I am English) to handbag so that I don&#x27;t have to move everything that I have accumulated and this pouch has worked very well.  My iPad fits into the center slot really well and I can accommodate everything else around it easily.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it, it makes everything easier to get in my purse.  it fit perfectly and I&#x27;m very thankful for it.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for the wife; she is totally satisfied with this product and intends to order another for a spare.</li>
    <li> Fits my bag perfectly and now I am organized, no more lost items. It is so easy to use, Love it</li>
    <li> the quality of product is great, shipped fast, just not sure that I love it as much as I thought it would. Now I have to many pockets and can&#x27;t remember where I put the items... So still feel like I am digging around a lot in my purse...</li>
    <li> I should have read the measurements first - didn&#x27;t fit into my handbag.  However, it  was not expensive so didn&#x27;t matter much</li>
    <li> RECEIVE ITEM  BEFORE TIME QUOTED,SIMPLE, EASY TO USE,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU,EASY FIT IN HANDBAG,MAKES ORGANIZING A EASY TASK</li>
    <li> Great size for taking my craft supplies with me on the go.</li>
    <li> This item was a gift and I don&#x27;t know how well it worked for the person receiving it.</li>
    <li> I love this-works very well in my purse.was very inexpensive,good quality,well made!i would def. recommend this!keeps things well organized in my purse.</li>
    <li> The color sucks,  the space is great, yes it is just an ok, not as I expected.  just an ok organizer</li>
    <li> I am always changing purses. Because a girl can &amp;#34;Never&amp;#34; have enough purses- right? Well now I can just take this bag and place it into any purse !!! So convenient !!!!Now all my girlfriends want one as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this mainly because my stuff in my medium size purse is always all over the place and I thought this would organize everything in there so I can find everything I need right away.  This is not the case.  This is flimsy so when I want to put my wallet back in, either the top caves in, or it gets caught in the 2 straps in the middle.  It is lightweight and it does organize your stuff in your purse, but it&#x27;s hard to get stuff in and out of the zippered pockets.  I like to just dump mail in my purse sometimes, and now I have to keep one hand in the organizer just to keep the pocket open long enough for me to slip my mail in there.  Otherwise it&#x27;s stuck on the top or just weirdly placed.  It doesn&#x27;t work for me.  Good thing it was just under $4.  I&#x27;ll see if my daughter wants it.  It&#x27;s creating more problems for me than the problem it was meant to solve.</li>
    <li> A little smaller than I expected but it looks good so we will see. Might get another one for my daughter.</li>
    <li> So small. Other than that, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> One of the belts was disconnected when I received it. I was depressed.And I had to repaired it by myself.</li>
    <li> Why I never had one of these before I&#x27;ll never know. Great for organizing your purse especially if you like to change them on a frequent basis! It&#x27;s as quick as 1,2,3! No more digging to the bottom of a single compartment bag. Everything is right at my fingertips especially if I&#x27;m driving. Can reach in and find my phone, keys, etc. without digging forever or distracting me from the rode! Love it! Will make a great inexpensive gift for my friends.</li>
    <li> I love this bag as a insert in my huge purses! Its sturdy which means so much to me. Its also affordable. I highly recommend this item .</li>
    <li> Definitely recommend it. It fits perfectly in my bag and is very functional. The price is great too!!! The shipping takes some time it was not an issue.</li>
    <li> Did not look or work the way I expected at all. I was expecting to fit it in my bag, but the quality was not great and I was not comfortable putting my expensive equipment in it for fear it wouldn&#x27;t keep the items secure or safe.</li>
    <li> I love the larger outside pockets on this - so much better than others I have tried .  Good value</li>
    <li> Very good material and very useful.</li>
    <li> I have had this for sooooo long and had to do a review now. It honestly makes for a very organized purse. The colors aren&#x27;t the cutest but it&#x27;s efficient. I also like the handles on both side that make it easier to pull out of a purse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this as an insert for my bag for over a year now and it is still in Perfect shape. I am a working mom of two boys and I throw a ton in my bag. With this I was able th switch from mom bag to tote bag to pocketbook with organization and ease!</li>
    <li> I bought this to help organize and keep track of lots of small items when I travel or are carrying a large tote bag with no small pockets.  It works well for this and is good considering how little it cost.  It arrived sooner than predicted.</li>
    <li> great for my purse.  I have had it for over a year, and can easily take it out and move it from one purse to the other.  Great quality, no rips or tears since I&#x27;ve had it.  Lots of pockets.  I have one that I use just for coupons too!</li>
    <li> Well worth the price! Bought two, and going to but a few more to give as gifts.  Stores an abundance of stuff and easily transfers to most any purse. Love it!</li>
    <li> This bag is awesome! When we go on trips I just grab this and go. All of my medicine, make up, glasses and hair products fit well!! Will get more for Christmas gifts!</li>
    <li> i have much big bags and never time to put all stuff i need from one bag to another, so this bag helps me every day</li>
    <li> Like it just fine for the task. Can&#x27;t beat the great price. Just takes a long time in shipping delivery.</li>
    <li> I like to switch purses a lot so this makes that process easy. Took a long time to get here all the way from China but I paid next to nothing for it and it works great.</li>
    <li> IT IS OKAY, BUT I FOLDED IT INSIDE OUT AND YOU CAN FIND THE THINGS IN IT A LOT EASIER.</li>
    <li> Not really worth the price! Not that sturdy and the stitches are not strong enough - too loose.</li>
    <li> The amount of pockets and nooks and crannies in this organizer are amazing.  However it doesn&#x27;t really stay open on its own unless the center pack is crammed full and some of the pockets become hard to access/see when its folded in on itself.</li>
    <li> I was planning on making on of these for my purse. Everything is at the bottom. I did turn it inside out and like the pockets more accessible . Well made and great price.</li>
    <li> Design is good and can hold a lot of stuff in an organized way.  However, material a bit too thick, though provides cushioning, but occupy more space inside the handbag.</li>
    <li> Straps ripped off after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> If you want to organize your purse, this makes it very easy. There are lots of pouches and 2 lage zippered pockets.</li>
    <li> I am a purse diva and this organizer makes it so much easier to change purses everyday.  It&#x27;s light weight and not bulky like some of the others.  Love it! Awesome!</li>
    <li> I choose this Item because I wanted to gather all my make up together and well organized. Is small and cute and all my make up fits.</li>
    <li> I got this at an amazing price! It&#x27;s a good organizer, very practical. The quality is excellent at such low price!</li>
    <li> Excellent - Very useful while traveling. Wish the central pouch was zipped - its hard to keep larger pouches unzipped as they contain items which may fall out.</li>
    <li> Expected it to be a little stiffer.  But what can I expect for the money?  It has a tendency to flop around my purse, which to me, defeats the purpose.</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured.  The whole thing seems well-made.  The seams hold well, stitching looks good.  The pockets are handy, a good variety of sizes.  Goes in and out of my big purses very easily.</li>
    <li> It is a great idea for women who like to switch purses often, it makes the process very simple and quick!</li>
    <li> this is very good to have.  I can now find my belonging in my bags.  Usually! I search for key, phone etc. Its different now. ha ha.  thanks for inventing this.  am happy with it.</li>
    <li> This organizer is great for the price. I use it sideways in my Bagalinni handbag main compartment and pull it out to find my stuff as my bag is taller than it is wide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I stuffed it full, I sewed 2 snaps on the handles over the main compartment so that they cross over and snap together keeping everything in that pocket securely inside if I have to pull out the whole organizer because of the way I have it oriented. But it makes finding everything so easy and all the other pockets hold my items securely.</li>
    <li> It looks hardly anything like the picture. Much smaller. The material in mine looks very cheap. It didnt break yet though, i read other reviews on this and most of them were that it broke when they opened it and for me it didnt. i made sure i was very gentle with it. but i dont think i want it in my purse. the side pockets are very very small and dont stretch very good. I regret buying this even at the price. I would look for another one on amazon and skip this one. Its not pretty at all either. in the picture it looks better but when u get it, its not pleasing.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item a while back and have been using it in my large tote bag. I was hoping that it would keep my wallet, checkbook, keys, lipgloss ect. organized, but everything gets lost as it just doesn&#x27;t hold any shape! It collapses into a shapeless mess inside my bag. Perhaps this would work better in a shorter, smaller bag? It&#x27;s funny the picture shows it as firm and sturdy, but it does not \\&quot;stand\\&quot; up like that at all!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great little addition to any purse for organization.</li>
    <li> Go to the window open it and throw your money out of it. Bought this item as an organizer for my purse, it broke in a week. Material is not quality. The edges will fray if you use to much. Purchase something else of better quality if this is the route you want to take.</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s an awesome buy. It holds ALL my papers and cosmetics. Now changing purses often is fun and easy.</li>
    <li> Serves its purpose. Has enough pockets.</li>
    <li> I originally wrote a good review for this bag but am now going back on it. When I first received this bag the netting on the front was very thin and ripped off. The bag was such a low price it would not be worth trying to return it. I used the other big pockets of this bag and it was perfect for my makeup. After 2 weeks, this whole bag fell apart. The stitching is really bad and it literally fell apart everywhere. Bottom line, It was great for 2 weeks and then no more. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> The concept of this item was good. The item is extremely large and will not fit it any of my purses, even the very large ones</li>
    <li> This is perfect, I love it, just what I need. Not only for travel but for daily use also.&lt;br /&gt;It is easier for me now to change bags.  I just grab it and put it in the bag I  choose.</li>
    <li> I really like this and it has helped me keep my pocketbook organized.  When I want to change bags, it is easy to do.</li>
    <li> Honestly......this is a great product.  It&#x27;s well made.  Sturdy. Secure stitching.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered one just to see the size, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Then I ordered 6 more to give as &amp;#34;no reason&amp;#34; gifts.&lt;br /&gt;Good company......I just wish the shipping didn&#x27;t take as long as it does.&lt;br /&gt;And there is no option to select faster shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Regardless......I will order again from this company.</li>
    <li> These are very nice purse inserts and a very good size. I was surprised at the size when I received mine .</li>
    <li> Its Awesome!! I am now able to keep my things very organized &amp; can find them without having to take everything out of my bag anymore!! 😃</li>
    <li> Love it. Been using it for over a year and its still in tact! Many compartments. I got bc my purse had only 1 pocket.</li>
    <li> Not what i expected its really small for my diaper bag</li>
    <li> lots of pockets but still a mess in the bag</li>
    <li> I rated it high it is a great item. I use it all the time keeps my items organized. thank YOU</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price.  And it keeps my purse organized.  So many pockets and areas for things.  Very well made.  For the price, it&#x27;s great.  Can&#x27;t believe it costs so little for a great product.</li>
    <li> I have this &amp;#34;pouch&amp;#34; inside my purse always.  It is great for organizing items with all the different pockets.  It makes changing purses quick and efficient, everything is transferred at the same time.  I had been looking for something like this for a long time.  Great price too.</li>
    <li> This product is a GREAT help!  It fit into my new purse perfectly, has tons of storage space and organizes all my different items perfectly. WELL WORTH the money.</li>
    <li> Good quality product but still not useful for my use. Collapses in bag.</li>
    <li> Organize your things with ease! the best bag organizer ever!</li>
    <li> Somethings are not worth selling or buying.&lt;br /&gt;This was just a compulsive shopping day.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it , I am stuck with it</li>
    <li> This is a nice and affordable organizer for your school bag or larger purses.  Please note that it&#x27;s only about 6 inches tall so you would not be able to use it as a sleeve for your files.  The length to height aspect ratio seems too high.  For this length, I expect a taller organizer.  Or at this current height, I expect a shorter length.  The organizer is a bit puffier than I expect with batting in the main compartment.  It&#x27;s probably good protection for delicate items but it does make it more bulky.  Overall, it&#x27;s a good organizer for the price.  You probably can&#x27;t make it from scratch for this price.</li>
    <li> handle broke pretty fast.</li>
    <li> I bought the largest Coach bag I could find. But it was way too deep with only a little pocket for my phone. Anything I dropped into my purse was lost until I dumped my bag. Now everything has a place.  I ordered one for my luggage and gifts.</li>
    <li> I bought it for a trip I took.  The middle section is expandable.  It has a lot of pockets that are of different sizes.  It held a lot of stuff for my trip.  It worked very well for me.</li>
    <li> It is light weight with plenty of pockets for small items, I love it, it is so easy to use for different purses.</li>
    <li> Can put any small things in a n organized manner. Very easy to pick stuff from it. Easy to navigate. Overall, a decent bag for storing stuff.</li>
    <li> well I ordered this grey and yellow, my mom wanted a purple one and then I ordered a pretty pink one for a friend of mine so we can all get our lifes together and organize our purses and workbags.</li>
    <li> i dont know why every review said this is large since its too small for me. unless everyone uses clutch bags!! as an organizer itself its pretty good, theres tons of compartments and it looks sturdy but it just is too small for my bag so its not worth it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this previously to gift.  This time, it&#x27;s for ME!!!  It&#x27;s a great asset to the hobo or large purses.</li>
    <li> I love this item and is just what I wanted for the inside of my purse and bag. I will be getting more in other colors.</li>
    <li> Very handy storage bag.  The best price by far.  It took a while to get it through the mail, but because of the good price it was worth the wait.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I purchased these organisers. Got them for my mother, sister and two friends. Very convenient to organize your purse essentials in this organizer and move to your different purses. Would definetly recommend to anyone who wants an organized purse but carries a large free form bag.</li>
    <li> This works so great! I am always finding purses that I like, but they have no pockets or zippers for my things :( However with this it is easy to put right in the purse and have all my things organized. Also it makes it easy to switch around to different purses for the day. The only reason I gave it 4 star is because the zipper is kinda hard to work with, it is all plastic.</li>
    <li> Wow, these are much better than I expected! They are very well made, my daughter uses them in many ways for organizing my g&#x27;kids stuff. I have ordered more for gifts, they will be good for many occasions.</li>
    <li> The item takes longer to arrive, but I am happy to get it. It  is made  with various size of pocket, convenient for many usages.</li>
    <li> I use it for all my school stuff and am suprised by how much it stores and all the little compartments. One of the best things I have ever bought especially if you like to be organized. I even bought one for a friend. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good but for what you pay for it!</li>
    <li> Cheap material ended up fraying after a few uses. however, still useful.</li>
    <li> Item arrived as expected. Very useful to organize things in my minivan.</li>
    <li> This organizer is smaller than I thought it would be. I wish their was more space in the middle for the larger items that I carry in my purse, but it organized my stuff and fits in almost any handbag, so there isn&#x27;t much room for complaints. I love that it has 4 pockets on each side to organize all the little stuff.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to put in my large beach/pool bag to keep the kids suntan lotion, hair brush, elastics, wipes and things together instead of at the bottom of the endless bag.  This is perfect.  So many compartments and everything is right at my fingertips.  Wish I ordered two for the price.  Maybe put one in the car for same things?</li>
    <li> This thing is a bad joke, Wont stay open, Collaspses every time you go to open it, Nothing like what it looks like</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this organizer for my purse.  I am able to find everything I need without taking everything out of my purse.  It has several sections and two zipper compartments.  I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I bought this bag to use as an insert in my shoulder purse.  Prior to getting this bag, I was having a hard time finding anything in my purse and was getting frustrated at how it sagged due to the uneven weight of things.  Now that I have this insert, I can organize more stuff into my handbag and find things more easily.  The best part, my purse no longer sags and stays balanced on my shoulder and no longer bunches in the middle.  Love it!.</li>
    <li> I really like this and use it every day.  Really keeps things organized.  I need a smaller one , too.</li>
    <li> This IS the easiest way to organize your handbag, tote, and travel too! This is a MUST have. Order now!</li>
    <li> It is a great bag and everything I had hoped for except one of the snaps was broke, but no big deal because I don&#x27;t snap it anyway</li>
    <li> The one thing I liked about the pouch is that it had alot of pockets.  But, the first time I used the bag, one of the handles broke. I would prefer that the pouch to be more sturdy.</li>
    <li> This organizer is GOOD but the quality is not good.  It has a strings on both side so that it&#x27;s like little bag that I can pull our from my purse.  But one string has broken off after I used it in a week.  Besides that, the net on the side is losing too.  With all of these, I still like it.  Wish China can make some quality goods...sigh.</li>
    <li> This really helped me get my coupons organized, as well as other items in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the great product!</li>
    <li> Ordered on Oct. 15.  Received Nov. 15.  Zippers poor quality.  One will not zip closed at all.  I know it was just $3 and change but it&#x27;s really not worth it.  I ordered a different one from amazon while I was waiting on this one and got it within 3 days.  It was a few dollars more but it works.</li>
    <li> I love being organized, but would get annoyed when purse would get jumbled. This has allows me to keep it all neat!</li>
    <li> Holds a lot of items, It is also expandable. Great Value for the money. Has Handles so you can carry just the small bag if you choose</li>
    <li> did not work for me....kept sliding around in my purse...so I gave it to my daughter who says it works for her.</li>
    <li> never arrived, I feel it was a scam, they should do something about it.&lt;br /&gt;I should return the money, do not think just what I have done</li>
    <li> i needed a product to place all my stuff and easily tranfer it from purse to purse. also something that will prevent from all hell breaking loose in my purse. you know its true. well this did it.</li>
    <li> I tend to carry large bags (13&amp;#34; plus) so this organizer is great for me.  There is a large main compartment, two zipper compartments, and many slip-in pockets.  It&#x27;s also expandable (width-wise).  It does seem to ship from China but it arrived pretty quickly.  Just don&#x27;t plan to return it if it&#x27;s not the right size for you.</li>
    <li> Came on early.  Use for chargers and cords.. small devices..  only problem the zippers, though well made, are a little sticky.</li>
    <li> This really helped me organize the purse my husband calls the &amp;#34;nose bag.&amp;#34;  That is my deep canvas bag that lets every thing shift to the bottom.  This pouch holds so much, and keeps it organized.  I think I may begin to change my purses more often.</li>
    <li> This organizer is not bad. However, it is best suited for the person that carries few items and smaller items. It has lots of compartments for those smaller items. It is made well and is the perfect size for most handbags. However, for tote bag carriers, it is not quite suitable as it is not very tall.</li>
    <li> It was just as it says.And I really like it.It holds alot.  The shipping did take a while but that was expected.</li>
    <li> I carry a lot of stuff in my purse.  I like shopping tote type bags and this is great to organize some of the clutter in the bag so my stuff is easier to get to.  It is quite small but in that regard it will fit most handbags.  The price was very good and even though it was shipped from China, it arrived quite fast. Only gave 4 stars because of the size.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  I had an old one that was slightly different but was so worn out it was falling apart.  This organizer is the perfect size for me, not too small with many compartments and easy to switch in and out of handbags.  Only disappointment was it too so long to get but for the price, I was willing to wait it out since I really wanted it.</li>
    <li> This insert is cheaply made and awkward in my purse. It would probably work better in a purse with structure.</li>
    <li> very roomy and fit in my purse just right.</li>
    <li> An excellent and serviceable product.  I had one that I lost and I bought this one to replace it</li>
    <li> I use this as my first aid and it makes it easy to find what I&#x27;m looking for very fast.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light and and it has a lot of pockets. It really helps organizing my little gadgets. Although not in the best quality, it is functional and affordable.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a great thing to switch to different purses, however it is way smaller than I needed.  Bummer.</li>
    <li> The sides are so soft, the only way I can put anything into any of the pockets is to use both hands, which in most cases is not possible to do. The bag folds over on itself and usually I am unable to get things straightened out until I get home and take everything out and start over.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at the quality. For the price it is a pretty nice product. It is big and roomy. The only concern are the zippers. I feel as if they might break if you try to open them too fast or too hard. Otherwise I love it!</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to organize my purse which is always a mess and found this little bag for a great price. Took a little long to get it but works perfectly. Holds my book, nail polishes, makeup and all my other misc stuff inside all the great little pockets it has.</li>
    <li> I love this bag , if I don&#x27;t want to carry a purse i use the bag and it has many departments</li>
    <li> This is great for larger handbags.  It is much easier to organize and find my various &amp;#34;things I can not live without&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Not good enough quality - but it&#x27;s very cheap... in any case after purchase I don&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;planned to keep keys/wallet/etc for car</li>
    <li> This product was  a little better than I expected considering the cost. I doubt it will last long but it&#x27;s fine for what I wanted.</li>
    <li> It fits everywhere perfectly, even in my smallest bag. At the same time there are anough mesh and zip pockets for a wallet, bills and envelopes, cellphone, keys, cosmetics, personal hygiene, small headphones, credit card and some money (in case I forget my wallet) and all this oh-so-necessary-to-have-in-my-purse stuff.</li>
    <li> I like the size - fits nicely in all of my purses. It&#x27;s easier to find things in by bag now. It&#x27;s great because I don&#x27;t feel like changing handbags is such a hassle anymore. The shipping too a very long time though. Over 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> This is so handy and useful. It arrived in a timely manner. My bag is always messy and I can never find things like my phone and wallet so this gives it some order. Its also durable. The only thing is it does not work well if your bag has a lot of depth because the other things in your bag would cover it. Generally good product. For an amazing price.</li>
    <li> Pretty good for the price!</li>
    <li> It is perfect to organize ones purse.  It can easily be removed when necessary.  I recommend this to anyone who carrys as much junk as I do in my purse.</li>
    <li> I love this, I put everything in it and when go to another purse, just pick it up and put it in. This is especially great for those floppy purses the do not want to stand up. Thanks for an excellent product.</li>
    <li> It is a little large for some purses, but it fits all the junk I carry around, It has a lot of room.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTLEY LOVE THIS BAG! I LIKE TO KEEEP EXTRA MAKEUP IN THE BATHROOM AND END UP PUTTING IT LOOSE IN THE DRAWERS. WITH THIS BAG THERE ARE SOO MANY COMPARTMENTS AND THE BAG IS MADE VERY WELL! IT TOOK A LITTLE TIME TO SHIP, BUT WELL WORTH THE PRICE! I ORDERED A SECOND ONE!</li>
    <li> this puch bag is light and organize my items very well. It is easy to pull out from bag to bag. however, just pay attention to your bag size, make sure it fits into your bags.</li>
    <li> It will work for what I intended.  Its just not quite as well made as I thought it should be.  But I am not disappointed.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I love my Longchamp bag but it was impossible to find anything in it. This little organizer came before the estimated delivery date and its the perfect solution for a big, open bag. All of the pockets provide great organization that are easy to access. The organizer also has handles, so it is really easy to pull it out when I want to lighten the load! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because its not as durable as I&#x27;d like.  I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months and it&#x27;s starting to tear in some places.</li>
    <li> I loved his product for the first few days I had it. I was organized, efficient and on top of my game! Then old habits came back and now I&#x27;m digging around my purse AND this bag to find my car keys. For the price it might be worth it for the extra pockets, but my purse is a dark void anyway no matter what.</li>
    <li> The reason I say its perfect, its perfect for me! I have the large bag purses with a flimsy piece of cardboard on the bottom. I am forever looking for this &#x27;n that! This pouch comes with pouches...everything is where I can find it quickly. Lots of space!</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel and tide up.</li>
    <li> Picture and description is true to actual product.  Great organizer for my handbags!  Plenty of pockets to hold everything including wallet and calendar.  Even though the price is cheap, the product does not look it.  Very happy, will buy again for gifts!</li>
    <li> GOING TO BAG TO BAG SO MUCH EASIER NOW.  CAN MOVE EVERYTHING WITH EASE AND NO MORE DID I FORGET SOMETHING.</li>
    <li> This bag took forever to arrive for me and once it did I opened it to find it falling apart.  I guess you get what you pay for but you at least would like for it to be intact when you open it for the first time!</li>
    <li> you need to make sure in the description that it says it doesnt come with something else that it is a insert itaelf i assumed it had another insert. but other then that iy will hold my make up</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an Assisant Wedding Coordinator, so all of us carry around a bag with last minute supplies needed for wedding parties.  This makes finding those supplies so much easier.  It will be invaluable for the coming season...and beyond!  I bought one for all of our team!</li>
    <li> I love this organizer!  It keeps all my things in my purse in there place and I don&#x27;t have to pull every thing out to find something.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat this for the price.  The zippers worked just fine on mine, and didn&#x27;t appear to be cheap at all.  I was very pleasantly surprised. Good sized compartments.</li>
    <li> Very handy. I used for traveling. Can fit in a tote or large handbag as well. It stands up nicely and you can fit alot of items in it. could use for cosmetics and toiletries or office items electronics etc. Good travel accessory.</li>
    <li> this bag was cheap and i don&#x27;t know what i was expecting.  Most of the pockets don&#x27;t even have anyway to close them.</li>
    <li> i love this organizer...it makes changing purses a breeze!!! there are so many compartments and nothing gets lost in the bottom of your bag.</li>
    <li> This is probably a good item but it is much too large to fit into standard or smaller size handbags.  It should be made in a smaller size as well.  I cannot use it.</li>
    <li> I have several different purse organizers and this is by far the best.  It is made for larger bags, so be aware of the published dimensions, but it is the lightest of the ones I own and is perfect for tote bags with plenty of compartments and two large zippered sides. It is well mad and useful, cost like $4, and I will be buying a couple more as gifts.</li>
    <li> Fabric ripped inside and out in several place in only a week of use.  Items ended up behind the fabric and lining.  Very cheap nylon.  Poorly made.</li>
    <li> Ese work nicely for people who have a closet full of purses and want to be able to change them out easily.</li>
    <li> It will work, but not exactly what I expected. But for the price I paid is worth it. I have not used it yet as haven&#x27;t traveled.</li>
    <li> I realize it&#x27;s only a couple of bucks, but the flimsiness of the thing makes it really hard to use.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these and they work really well for a large pocketbook or tote. Especially nice if you are using a tote or pocketbook for a baby bag. Good price too!</li>
    <li> Great item for switching larger purses without all the fuss! Wonderful product with zipper and pockets for all your accessories.</li>
    <li> Perfect for larger purses I gave two away for gifts and friends&lt;br /&gt;are using them. The color is pretty drab but outside of that&lt;br /&gt;they are lovely</li>
    <li> I bought 3 of these and my friends and myself love them! They came in really quick too! Don&#x27;t know what we did without them.</li>
    <li> excellent buy for the money,roomy,great for almost any thing you want to put in it ,sturdy-well built-I will buy again</li>
    <li> As long as the large bag purses are in style, I&#x27;ll be using this product! It cuts way back on my frustration level when I&#x27;m trying to retrieve something from the bottom of my purse.</li>
    <li> This helps me keep my purse SO organized it is WONDERFUL!  It has 2 handles on either side of it to make it easier to pull the entire insert out of your bag easily in the event that something were to slip under it.  Great design, plenty of room.  Wish the zippers weren&#x27;t highway line yellow, but that&#x27;s the only thing I can think of that I would change!  No one can see them in the purse anyway, but the whole insert could be a little prettier.</li>
    <li> Purchased this bag super cheap, and it is my travel bag for all of my toiletries and cosmetics. It is super roomy and you would be surprised how much you can fit in this thing. Now, when I travel I just grab and go!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my mom and sister who are always complaining about purse organization. They loved them!  They both now have organized bags that they can simply pull up and put right into another bag without and hassle!</li>
    <li> Christmas Stocking Gift for granddaughters. They carry a lot of large purses so I think this will work good for them.</li>
    <li> Great value! Perfect for organizing my larger tote - no more digging in the bottom of the bag! I love all of the pockets!</li>
    <li> Sencilla. Se descocieron algunos bolsillos.</li>
    <li> OK, so my purse is no longer a black hole, but now I have so many compartments, I can&#x27;t remember where anything is!  Zip!  Zip! Zip! But other than my own issues with finding and remembering a place for everything, this is a very handy way to keep your purse organized and makes for a quick, easy purse swap.  The material is easy to keep clean, the zippers are ok, but not super sturdy, but you can&#x27;t beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A better system would have labels....</li>
    <li> Spacious and tons of pockets for organizing but already falling apart after a month of light use.  I&#x27;d say you get what you pay for but the more expensive versions of this item appear to be identical.</li>
    <li> I know what I want when I order something I need now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t dislike it , It works for me. But add more solid colors besides the two-tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would buy this and recommend this to anybody. Now my sister want&#x27;s one. What I love about this is that I can add this to any bag of my choosing. It helps me by having pockets to add more things inside. I can see this is any light without using a flashlight to look inside my helper. Plus you can make it smaller by snapping the ends together for narrow bag of your choice or say luggage item is narrow now you can make this fit to.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very light weighted. Size is just right for my purse. There are many pockets to fit in different stuff. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have purchased other handbag organizers, and they were very substantial. This one is very flimsy.  I cannot use it as a handbag organizer; I am just using it to store my coupons. I would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this bag... great for purse...  Is there a handbag it snaps into? Thank you for the freebie.</li>
    <li> Gret product bought two one for me &amp; one for sis Now things dont get lost in my purse !</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by its size and quality of construction.  It&#x27;s just the right size for my unstructured carry on.</li>
    <li> Love this product-exactly as described, keeps my purse organized so I&#x27;m not rummaging in the bottom looking for everything.  Quality is great, have had no issues with tears, rips or zipper.  I bought two, just in case, but now may give the second one as a gift.</li>
    <li> I refused to spend a lot of money on the typical ugly diaper bag, so I continue to use the bags that I love with this insert.  The little compartments keep me organized and the price is unbeatable.</li>
    <li> Light and convenient.</li>
    <li> I like these padded organizers and this one is not disappointing at all.  For under $4, it&#x27;s well worth my investment.  My tablet (Xoom) fits right in there and even if I&#x27;m not traveling, it is still handy to carry it with you from room to room in the house.</li>
    <li> it works great , keeps everything in order i&#x27;m glad I bought two easier to change to another hand bag</li>
    <li> the stitching is poor and crooked.  the price is good but the quality is par for the price paid for the items</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but not as I expected. It&#x27;s puffy a lot or too much of little slots. I would go with my old pecil pouch from walmart, it&#x27;sfit ( too long for my small-medium purse. Unless you like the kind of material or extreamly load of slots. But not for me.</li>
    <li> I love my handbag pouch it fits almost all of my purses with 11 pockets and the handle I can just pick it up and transfer to a different purse it is a lot better than the seen on tv kangaroo ones they avertising and it is a lot Cheaper I am going to buy a couple more for my kids and another one for my gym bag I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> Works great for what I wanted it for.  Fits in my bag perfectly.  I Love all the compartments and zippers.</li>
    <li> Really convenient and a place to put each item. I was able to let go of individual bags and put things in each compartment! It&#x27;s a great weight lifter in lightening the load</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I got to use the bag when there is no zipper on the main middle pocket.</li>
    <li> Great price. It was a bit bigger than I expected, but that wasn&#x27;t a problem. It arrived a lot earlier than the expected arrival date, I got it in less than two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for larger handbags.</li>
    <li> Light weight and functional. Zippers are a bit harsh on the fingers if left unzipped.</li>
    <li> this is so practical and wonderful, that I should of gotten a long time ago. It has a place for everything and now I don&#x27;t have to dig around in my purse always looking for things.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s bigger than I anticipated. When I showed it to my friends, they all wanted one. However it could be improved by inserting a piece of material at the base to keep it from closing in.</li>
    <li> Its my wife&#x27;s personal grocery coupon store bag.&lt;br /&gt;Okay quality (right for the price I guess).&lt;br /&gt;Amazingly spacious and easily foldable.&lt;br /&gt;Poor choice for storing cash and valuables though.&lt;br /&gt;A little dull in color except that its a good buy for people who have loads to store.</li>
    <li> Out of the many choices of inserts for purses this one provides the best options.  There are lots of pockets in different sizes with some being open, some with zippers, and the middle section can be open or snapped to be smaller.  A full size women&#x27;s  billfold that includes a checkbook fits in the center with room to spare. Seams were all sewn well. It easily transfers from shoulder bag to purse or even travel bags while keeping everything in it&#x27;s place.</li>
    <li> I got this in very short time and the quality is excellent. Zippers are heavy duty plastic and it fits perfectly into my purses, even the smaller ones. Im going to order another one!</li>
    <li> This removeable purse liner has the best design of any I&#x27;ve seen and I&#x27;ve looked at pretty much all of them on Amazon plus some other websites. It is one of the largest I saw, because I wanted one where I could slide my iPad into the center pocket. (I suggest measuring your purses to make sure you buy the best size for you.) I switch it at least one or twice a week and it has two little handles attached to the inner pocket to make it easy to lift out of your purse. I&#x27;ve definitely gotten my money&#x27;s worth even though one of the mesh pockets has now come loose, but that&#x27;s probably from me overstuffing it.</li>
    <li> I got this for Christmas as a gift from my mom because she knows how dependent I am on purses...they&#x27;re my security blanket &amp; my &amp;#34;girl scout emergency kit&amp;#34; all in one.  This usually translates to me carrying a ton of stuff in my handbags, but it always getting sloshed around in some of the purse styles I have. BUT...I didn&#x27;t have a purse at the time for it to fit into, so I just stashed it in the closet for the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I got a &amp;#34;legacy&amp;#34; Coach saddle bag style purse for the holidays as a gift from someone else and when I opened it, there was nothing but 1 skinny flat zipper compartment in the vast open purse. I had a novel idea: I wonder if this insert would work in it.  And yes, it just fit, and now, I am able to use my stylish Coach purse without the interior of the handbag looking like someone shook up a woman&#x27;s bedroom &amp; closet and whatever fell out happened to find its haphazard way into the handbag.  Things, from pens to checkbooks, my contact solution to my glasses, makeup to medications I travel with, are all neat and securely contained within.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to folks who usually carry a ton of stuff around in their handbags or tote bags (yes, it fits easily in those) and wish to keep everything neat &amp; tidy and easy to access regardless of sloshing their bag around during normal life &amp; moving around.</li>
    <li> One of the fabric loops became detached within a day of my purchase.  I wrote the company, and i understood they were sending me a replacement, but it  has not yet arrived.  Good concept and price, but it seems a little flimsy.</li>
    <li> A bit smaller than I thought but okay.</li>
    <li> The handbag pouch keeps everything organized, especially when my daughters make me hold their stuff. I have a makeup area and a pouch for my phone.</li>
    <li> This is the item that I use for eveyday. It is so good that I carry them on vacation, travel and weekend with friends. I will buy more.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 12 year old daughter for added organization. I love it in her backpack so things aren&#x27;t rolling around everywhere!</li>
    <li> Although it is not very big and I can fit it in my medium size handbags, I think it goes a lot better in a bigger size handbag. So if you like over-sized handbags, like I do, you will find this very helpful. I carry around a lot of things (I guess most women do): rewards cards, pills, tissue, sanitizer, hair brush, makeup, Tide stain remover, snacks, writing utensils etc so without this organizer my bag is always a mess. It takes forever to find anything. This has enough pockets to help me be very organized. The front mesh pockets aren&#x27;t very resistant, the stitching wasn&#x27;t perfect, but I fixed it and it looks like new. Other than that, I have no complaints about it. Gray is a good color since it doesn&#x27;t get dirty very easily. And what I love about it is I can now switch bags easily. If I want to wear a different handbag every day, I don&#x27;t have to take everything out and move it into the new bag. I can simply move the organizer into the new bag. It&#x27;s very lightweight and if you don&#x27;t have a lot of bulky items, it doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
    <li> this bag is awful. not only did it take so long to get to me but within the first 3 days the zipper broke and my make up fell out all over the place then shortly after the stitching became undone. then about a month later the second zipper just fell off. and they sent me the wrong color. this is awful and i certainly would NEVER buy anything from them again and i do NOT recommend.</li>
    <li> It is the perfect size for any purse, it works great. I love all the different compartments. I even got it faster than I expected.</li>
    <li> I love this item. I am constantly digging in my purse trying to find things. Now I can purchase purses with the &#x27;void&#x27; and not worry about losing my items.</li>
    <li> slow to arrive - fits and works well for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handy pockets in the bag help you keep your mobile, keys, purse, make-up and other essential items organised and within easy reach. Strong nylon construction.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s  not as big as I thought it would be.The picture  makes  it look bigger.</li>
    <li> Finally, an organizer that works in more than one bag.  I have tried other ones and they do not fit all my bags.  This one even fits into one of the pockets of my backpack.  There is plenty of room even for my cell phone and charger.  If you are looking for a good sized organizer that will even hold a standard sized paperback book, this is the one for you.</li>
    <li> Scrunches down in your purse, worthless as purse liner.  Good enough for little travel cosmetic bag.  Well constructed, just very soft and floppy.</li>
    <li> The zippers don&#x27;t work very well otherwise I like all of the compartments and the size of the handbag pouch bag.</li>
    <li> I ended up ordering 2 more of these for gifts...lol  I love this.  It is cheap, and works perfect. Now I change purses easily &amp; dont dread it.  I can match my purse to my outfits everyday.  :D  Great product. Took about 8 weeks to get in the mail though. it comes from china but well worth the wait. :D</li>
    <li> After looking at many reviews I&#x27;m glad I purchased this to organize my purse space.&lt;br /&gt;I switch between bags, and this has made it easier to know everything is where it needs to be.&lt;br /&gt;I carry a medium sized purse, and this fits inside wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;The snap closures on either end help adjust the organizer for smaller/narrower spaces.&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t super sure about this when I bought it due to the long lead time, somewhat dubious &amp;#34;color may vary&amp;#34; warning, and low cost. However the organizer is reasonably well built and did come in the indicated color. It&#x27;s well designed and very useful.</li>
    <li> Its verry helpfull speacialy if You Have a lot Of Work or  meatings. Where You need to use diferente hand bag or travel bags for each ocasión&lt;br /&gt;You just mouve it from One to One And save You a lot Of time.</li>
    <li> Keeps all pertinent items in one place-great if you change your bag often!</li>
    <li> Amazing little storage handle it holds all of my tools if I am ever on the go I take it with me and it is the perfect fit for all my tools! 10/10</li>
    <li> Took me a while to write a review about this because I was waiting to write about the conditions so far. IT IS SO GOOOD! IT FIT MY BAGS AND IT KEPT IT ORGANIZED. It is not worn or torn yet which is amazing considering that I bought this years ago haha. It has enough pockets for gosh knows what, but not too much that you wouldn&#x27;t know where you last put your things. It molds with your bag so your bag won&#x27;t look so bulky with the things in it c&#x27;: Now I find my car keys with ease!</li>
    <li> I had written how happy I was with the product although it had arrived late. However, today (second time I&#x27;ve used it) the wire mesh broke on one of the sides. A pity, because otherwise the product would have been perfect. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend a lot of money on this. So if nothing else breaks, it&#x27;ll be good for the amount paid.</li>
    <li> Cannot love this item enough.  I use it for craft supplies, but am going to order others for all over the house!</li>
    <li> This hand bag organizer is one of the best things that happened to me my hand bag was a bottomless pit very pathetic and embarrassing .This organizer fits perfect in my hand bag has 3 storage compartments and as you see in the photo the part facing out has compartments as well as on the other side also.one side has 4 pockets 2 that are see through and the other side has 6, 2 that are small where I put my hand lotion and hand soap and the other holds my lipstick perfect.This also has 2 small handles in the middle compartment so if you switch purses just lift it out and place in another purse.The zippers on this I would be very careful the zipper is plastic and the part you zip it is metal so far I had no problems with the zipper but I did run a candle not lit of course over the zipper so the wax prevents it from getting stuck ,I know it works on the metal zippers not sure about the plastic but I tried it anyway and so far its good.Also this has buttons on the sides that snap together to make it smaller if you choose.another plus about this if your purse tips over your belongings wont be all over the place that&#x27;s happened to me many times now I don&#x27;t have to worry it will all stay put in this awesome organizer.This arrived fast in about 9 days and I like these so much I ordered 2 more for back ups and these would make great gifts especially to people like myself who just couldn&#x27;t get organized.</li>
    <li> this is very good ,it is my frist christmas gift ,i love it so much!And the shller is very nice,thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this product and the price is awesome! I just place it in the center of my purse and it helps me organize everything.</li>
    <li> because if I would have known it was going to take a month to get  and from chine i would have order it.</li>
    <li> I am glad I ordered it.  Works well with my larger bags, especially my summer straw ones. Keeps my items organized.</li>
    <li> Decent bag. Lots of pockets but it&#x27;s floppy. Doesn&#x27;t stand up straight like in the picture unless you have books or something in the side pockets.</li>
    <li> Its just like the picture and has many expandable pockets with plenty of storage. I only wish the bottom was stable-i had to cut some cardboard to fit so it would sit flat on my passenger seat. I use it to hold items and keep my car organized. I like it over all</li>
    <li> I use this bag organiser at work all the time. I use many different types of little tools and supplies on the job, and this bag makes transporting everything around much easier.</li>
    <li> It ships from China so it might take awhile to get to you.  I almost wish I had bought 2 because it is such a great value and a handy compartment for large bags/purses.</li>
    <li> i have tried a few of these organizers and this is the best so far. well compartmentalized, easy to use and easy to switch around, it&#x27;s a big plus that it can also be zippered. I have 3 sisters, and everyone of them got one</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these little bags, one for mom and one for myself. I love to stuff computer, ipad, and iphone charges in them and then toss them into a backpack when traveling. Also great for large handbags.</li>
    <li> This great little organizer makes it easy to transfer all my essentials from one purse to another.  The shipping was super fast. Well constructed. Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to hold all those little items that get lost in a purse and this bag does the trick. Going to buy more for Christmas presents:)</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this product considering I only paid $3 for it.  I have been using it over a month, nearly two, and it doesn&#x27;t show any wear at all.  Fits well into my purse, organizes all of my stuff, and is durable.  What more could I ask for?  I wish I had ordered extras for my family :D</li>
    <li> Nice purse organizer. Didn&#x27;t end up working for me because the purse I got already had one built in, but I gave it to my mother and she really likes it.</li>
    <li> The picture makes this item look like it is wider than it is.  It is very thin.  Feels a little cheap.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this organizer.  It has a ton of pockets, is sturdy and works perfectly to keep things separate in my purse.  I bought one for my mother, but I wish I had bought two for myself instead of just one!</li>
    <li> Despite the long shipping time, this is a great product at a great price! It fits perfectly in my medium-large handbag, and I actually still have enough room to shove the organizer to one side of my purse and stick a water bottle next to it.  It&#x27;s so convenient to have all the pockets of different sizes - the large one in the middle is the right size to stick my large wallet and would also be good for most books/kindles/DVD&#x27;s. The two large zipper pockets are perfect to store coupons and other things. The smaller pockets around the sides hold flash drives, nail clippers, earbuds, makeup, tissues, eyedrops, and my stack of backup cards that I don&#x27;t keep in my wallet. My purse actually looks better with this organizer inside, because it helps it to hold it shape better, rather than collapsing. I&#x27;m thrilled with this product and will be purchasing another one as a gift and another one to put in my car between my two front seats to hold pens/notepads, a small tissue box, baby wipes, my compact umbrella, hand sanitizer, and the other odds and ends that seem to float around in my car. Highly recommended for the price!</li>
    <li> I think it is hit and miss with Sodial products I guess. I liked this one though. This one was a deal and good. Good purse organizer. Gave one to my daughter. Keep 2 for me lol. It worked out great. It did have a bit of a plastic smell like many things you order do. But I let it air out a week or so and it was fine. Using in my purse now and I do love it. And the price was so good!</li>
    <li> Exactly what is shown in the picture! It has a lot of pockets. Cheap price but good quality.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This organizer was not due to arrive before Jan.14 and I got it today(Jan.7)! To my surprise it is a very well made product and it will come in very handy. I ordered 2 so my husband could use one in his suitcase,(lots of pockets for toiletries).I would recommend this because it has more uses than just your purse.</li>
    <li> Kind of a pain to use in your purse. You think it will be an easy fit but it leaves you digging for your stuff just as much. Great concept, it just needs a little refining to make this a useable product.</li>
    <li> It got here in only 11 days! I&#x27;m surprised at how many compartments there are. I like to keep all my things organized, so I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and the price.</li>
    <li> Made well but too large for my needs. I may use it when traveling or may give to a friend who carries a very large purse.</li>
    <li> You do get what you pay for. Good idea but not if it breaks on the very first go around..buy better quality if there is one</li>
    <li> It worked keeping things in my purse organized. I don&#x27;t use it much</li>
    <li> I love this organizer... my friends laugh at me ... but it keeps my big pocketbooks tidy.... No more digging at the bottom of the bag.</li>
    <li> Have not put this in my purse yet, but it seems very roomy.  The zippers are plastic and do stick a little, but the pouch is better quality than I expected for the price.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Best  for any women who needs to change handbags in a hurry. I got one as a gift &amp; ordered the second one. Great price T though coming from China it took barely two &amp; Half weeks. Great price as well.</li>
    <li> This organizer was exactly what I was looking for! You can&#x27;t beat the price anywhere. It takes a couple weeks to receive item but it is well worth the wait!</li>
    <li> Love it. Everyone who likes to switch out bags should own one. Good size that works with most  bags. Made durable enough.</li>
    <li> Even though the material feels cheap, I have used mine for months and have not seen any damage. The only reason I give it four stars is because the material is a little crinkly sounding when you fish around for something in it, but overall, I love this and when mine eventually does wear out (It doesn&#x27;t look like it will be for a good amount of time though) I will buy a new one</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for sometime and it was kinda cheaply made, but for the price its a steal. I just sewed it back together last night as a matter of fact. But all in all I have purchased several now as gifts and stuffed then with goodies.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really happy with this item . It just did not fit in my purse right  maybe if I had a different purse I would  have been happier</li>
    <li> Love it .  now I can grab everything I need at once and drop into any type of bag in need to carry.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because I hated that everything I was looking for was always at the bottom of my purse. Now I can find things easily.</li>
    <li> I like all the side compartments and zippered sections.  I wish the material was alittle stiffer to hold more upright.</li>
    <li> I love this little pouchvits veryvhandy for a actual purse or messenger bag. So many pockets and it helps safe electronics on water rides(I went to six flags recently.</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase. First of all, I was attracted by the cost of an item. When I received an item and saw that the goods are of high quality. Very functional organizer. Easy to use. This is not a fungible thing as a journey, and in everyday life.</li>
    <li> Love it! Great for the price! Long wait but it is didclosed.</li>
    <li> This is such a clever product. It has so many different places to put things so I can be as organized as I want to be. The pockets are very roomy while they still can squish smaller so you can still take the pouch into your smaller bags. I never lose my things anymore. I recommend this to people all the time.</li>
    <li> For the price this is AMAZING!! I don&#x27;t know or understand why anyone would complain about a problem with this when it&#x27;s so cheap!! Oops, affordable. Use it til it falls completely apart then throw it away and buy a different style. At less than $4 I can&#x27;t believe anyone would complain. You want perfection? Go pay $30-$50 and you&#x27;ll get it. I love mine and so does everyone that received it from me as a gift. So what if the zipper sticks - we just work around that little problem. It is WORTH THE MONEY!!</li>
    <li> Great organizer for large bags</li>
    <li> I love to carry large bags for work and travel but always lose patience with having to dig for keys and anything else that seems to disappear into the black hole I call a tote bag.  I ordered this organizer a couple of months ago and have had no issues with it.  I find it is easy to stay organized and find what I need quickly.  It fits perfectly into the bottom of the tote.  I did have a minor issue of the bag wanting to slip, not stay upright  (as it moved in the tote when you carried it) but I solved that with a quick Velcro strip to the bottom of the bags.  Now it stays perfectly in place and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I use this with every purse I change into.  Everything is organized and if a purse I like doesn&#x27;t have enough compartments, this always does the trick.</li>
    <li> makes my bigger bags more organized! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Worth the couple dollars, holds up great!&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again..arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I was expecting something smaller, it is so large, it is hard to fit in a lot of my purses. Wish it were smaller  as it would be more universal to use.</li>
    <li> This is the most versatile bag I have ever owned. It is so handy to just transfer it from purse to purse, and the amount of pockets for wallet, cell phone, glasses, cosmetics, etc., etc., etc., is amazing!</li>
    <li> This looks just like the picture. Fit good in my purse. It can be hard to get into they side pockets, specially if you have a good amount in it. Ended up not using it for long though it&#x27;s a great idea.</li>
    <li> Its small, but big enough to fit in my purse. it was so inexpensive so its worth the cost. I like and recommend it to those looking at this.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for  an organizer and  found  my favorite color, this  is a  great  product and  I will be using  it all the  time</li>
    <li> It was just as expected from the picture and description. good construction. fantastic price. will be buying in more sizes.</li>
    <li> Just grab and go.  Love it. Very easy to change purses.  Quick and easy. Good buy for the money.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Bought several to give to friends. Keeps the inside of my bag organized.</li>
    <li> This product looked as if it would be prefect. Until I had to use it, it took up a lot of room inside of my purse. It also made the purse seem bulky.</li>
    <li> great little insert for a messy purse.</li>
    <li> Good price.  Like the use of space.  THE ONE DRAWBACK---the main part of the makeup bag has no zipper to close it</li>
    <li> It is smaller than is depicted in the picture. It works, but it is definitely not as big as advertised.</li>
    <li> Was smaller than I excepted but works ! Well worth the money others about the same size sold for 20.00- 30.00 dollars</li>
    <li> Great size for your everyday bag. Has many pockets and keeps things very organized. Changing purses is a breeze when using this product.</li>
    <li> It is big and fits a lot of stuff in it, but it is so cheaply made. It keeps falling apart on me.</li>
    <li> It was much smaller than expected. I was going to use it as a doggie bag for when I was walking my dog every day, but it was much too small for that purpose.</li>
    <li> I love this so much! So many wonderful pockets to keep my purse organized! I had a handle break but it&#x27;s still a great product</li>
    <li> I bought several of these because of the price I got them for.  I had been given an expensive on as a gift and it wore out.  These are still going... great to keep your purses organized.</li>
    <li> It is very handy for traveling. The center does not close so items can fall out, but overall it is very useful.</li>
    <li> it is an ok product, but the seams popped. the whole thing is falling apart. This is a great idea, and I would buy something like this again, but this particular product needs more work.</li>
    <li> I love this purse organizer.  I received my item pretty quickly despite what other reviews had said.  It has great compartments and fits wonderfully in my purse.  The only flaw is the zippers are pretty cheap so you have to slide them carefully but for the price you can&#x27;t beat this item!</li>
    <li> Its okay good for medium to large handbags, it does make it easier to find stuff in my purse like my cellphone which always gets lost</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant in ordering this at first.  I am so glad I ordered.  This is great for purses that do not have any compartments inside.  This helps keep everything in place and handy to find.  I change purses often and this makes the change over so easy.</li>
    <li> It is well constructed, and works exactly as I would expect. I am hoping to order more for Christmas gits...</li>
    <li> Nothing to write home about.</li>
    <li> Much smaller than it showed in the picture! Very useful if it is bigger! The one I received is only about 6&amp;#34;(h) x 10&amp;#34; (l) x 2.5&amp;#34; (w). It said &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; in the description,and &amp;#34;Size Approx: 11.2&amp;#34; x 6.7&amp;#34; x 3.3&amp;#34; &amp;#34;, it is smaller than that measure!</li>
    <li> This is a very useful bag, the only problem I&#x27;ve had is one of the straps came undone from where it was sewn to the body. No biggie, I still use it every day.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product. Better then I expected. Made for large pocketbooks. I can now change bags without  forgetting a criteria item</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used an organizer, and it really does help keep things organized in any purse that has few pockets. This organizer is made well.</li>
    <li> Good concept, but hard to reach into to find what I need.  Maybe only good for wide open pocketbooks. Mine is a bucket type and I struggle to get out what I need at times,</li>
    <li> I realize the price is unbeatable, but if you can&#x27;t wait a LONG time for this item to arrive, this is not the choice for you.  However, the quality is great; there are many pouches to store items.  I use it in my canvas tote that I use as a purse, and it&#x27;s great to know where everything is.</li>
    <li> Nice size has plenty of pockets. Two zippered long pockets, I will be able to get most of my items inside. It came in plastic wrap and smelled horrible I had to leave it outside and opened for two days before the smell went away. This was why the 3 stars, it remains to be seen how it holds up but for the price I wanted to try.</li>
    <li> I thought it was nice, a little to big for a regular size pocketbook.  i will give my other one as a gift for the holiday&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I love the bag but it ripped on the bottom in many spots.  I did not over stuff it either!! Needs better material!! My recommendation would be to spend more on a better bag.  You get what you pay for!!</li>
    <li> This Bag Organizer is light weight, and it allows me to have a place for everything. The price is right too.</li>
    <li> I use it in my &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; handbag as well as whenever I change to my &amp;#34;not so everyday bags&amp;#34;.  I highly recommend getting this...there&#x27;s a spot for everything.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly how it appears in the pics. I gave 4 stars only because I havn&#x27;t used it yet but seems like it will work with my tote which I&#x27;m carrying on a flight.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nifty little carrying case although it&#x27;s smaller than I thought it would be</li>
    <li> The designer of this handbag organizer had to be a woman, or a man who listened to women. This handbag organizer offers a myriad of organization solutions, with several pockets of varying sizes and fabric, so some are quite sturdy and others can handle fragile items with care. The middle section can be made more narrow by snapping the built-in doohickeys provided for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the $3.69 price, with an incredible array of color choices and free S&amp;H, almost too good to be true, but I believed amazon would intercede on my behalf if I ended up with junk. Worse come worse, I&#x27;m out &amp;#60;$5 But NOOOO! It is extremely well-made and I heartedly recommend it, at least in bright yellow&amp;#60;g&amp;#62;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery did take about two weeks from Hong Kong.</li>
    <li> The soft sides of this case ended up as a clump of extra fabric in the bottom of my bag.  Truly not something you need in your life.</li>
    <li> really loved this bag and a great price ! Fits a lot of those little take along things you need for baby.</li>
    <li> These bags (I ordered 3) were a good value for the price.  A tip I would offer to those who are thinking of purchasing them.  Yes, mine did have a slight odor to it.  Plan on airing out the bag for a few days to get that smell out.  Also, the zippers weren&#x27;t top quality, but I put a little olive oil on mine as soon as I got them and it really helped to make them work better. (Except the first one - which I got frustrated with and broke before I thought of the olive oil!).  That bag I use in my dresser to keep things organized.  It is definitely large - larger than MOST hand bags, so make sure you have a very large purse or bag to use these.  That said, they do keep you very organized and have a place for all my purse essentials (and then some!)</li>
    <li> I prefer the Hobo or Feedsack type of purse.  this makes it so much easier to find things without dumping it!</li>
    <li> Wow, for what I paid is better than what I expected.  It makes changing purses totally super easy, just grab and drop.  I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> My niece introduced me to these when she heard me say I never buy a purse if it didn&#x27;t have sections in it.  Now I can purchase any pocketbook and give it automatic sections without having to worry about forgetting to transfer important items from one purse to the next.  Just pick up the organizer and place the whole thing in your new purse and you&#x27;re set to go.  It couldn&#x27;t be any easier.</li>
    <li> My purse is what my husband describes as the diaper bag for adults. I keep everything in there from a hair things (brush, comb, hair bands) to makeup (eyeliner, mascara, blush/eyeshadow, powder brush, 5 lipsticks, and 3 glosses) to mouth stuff (toothbrush, toothpaste, breath strips) as well as deodorant, chap-stick, my wallet, handheld games, phone charger, game charger, charging docks, a book, and an umbrella.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now while I don&#x27;t carry all that for me, I&#x27;m always carrying around a tote for all this, and it gets bothersome. Now my purse is tiny and no one comes up to me accusing me of stealing (this was becoming a problem due to the size of my purse).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside; the mesh netting on the outside, while useful, is poorly made, therefor the seams ripped and the netting tore within a week of getting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price though, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> I bought two of these - and one of them (mine) has completely fallen apart - the top handles became unstitiched.  My mom&#x27;s is still going but I think it&#x27;s because she doesn&#x27;t use it as often as I used mine.  Other than falling apart - it did work while I used it. Only other drawback was that it was a little too flimsy making it collapse in my purse.</li>
    <li> It is just what you said it was going to be. Love mine. Not much to look at. But not ugly either!!!!!!  I love being able to take mine into a store and not have to carry my large purse. I have TWO.. one larger one for coupons and one smaller one for my junk and change purse. LOVE them both and the price was GREAT!</li>
    <li> This purchase arrived exactly when promised...&amp; in perfect condition. Possibly even better than I expected! This organizer is just what was needed to keep a busy and sometimes unorganized person a bitvmorecon track! It&#x27;s easy to use and transfer between different bags! Excellent for travel. As well as daily life.</li>
    <li> got for a great price and helps keep my purse organized.</li>
    <li> It is very orderly until you put it in your purse!! It basically collapses and you cannot put anything taller than  2 inches on all mesh outer pockets.  Its a great idea but needs improvements.  So, yep I still can&#x27;t find most things in my purse..</li>
    <li> Great product... Just wished the materials was better, but for the price this is great!!</li>
    <li> This handbag pouch was nice for the price (under $4).  I received the item quickly (less than 3 weeks after placing the order).  I think it will work out fine, but there are too many pockets (big and small) for my taste to be used in my purse.  I will use it, but probably more as a make up bag for vacations.  My first impression is that it is good quality for the price.  I like it a lot and would recommend it if you like a lot of pockets or little areas for every single thing in your purse.</li>
    <li> I like it. It may not be made the best, one side has compartments that the stitching ripped already, but other than that, well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Very handy, however the zippers stick a little and it is a little annoying, but otherwise it works great!&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I got several of these for gifts and one for myself. I love a big hobo bag. but, let&#x27;s face it, you can&#x27;t find anything in the big black hole of a purse.  So, this keeps everything in place and easy access. It&#x27;s also great if you switch purses a lot like I do. The workmanship is great.  Price is fantastic. The gray color doesn&#x27;t bother me because it&#x27;s hidden inside my purse and no one will see it.  I can totally see other applications for this organizer.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t think this cosmetic bag acts as a \\&quot;small, purse/bag fitting\\&quot; item, because personally it&#x27;s a purse/carrying bag in itself! It&#x27;s a perfect size and it has handles on it with many different compartments that fit all my makeup into one. Before, my makeup was in at least 3 different containers, but now, it&#x27;s all compact into one thanks to SODIAL. I recommend.</li>
    <li> Love the way it fits in my purses. It lets me add more things to my purse and organize it better.</li>
    <li> I have showed this off to so many people and now they want it!  Wish it could have shipped faster, but at least it told me that it wasn&#x27;t going to come for a month!</li>
    <li> The product is exactly as described and is a clever idea.  My problem is that it is too large to fit into my purses.  I am sure it would be a great asset to anyone carrying a large bag.</li>
    <li> I was very pleasantly surprised to see how well made this little organizer is.  I wish I had bought a few more while they were on sale to give to friends as gifts.  Great little organizer and not a bad price at all!</li>
    <li> fits well and has a good usable pouch and segments. good for empty hollow knd of handbags easily transferable to another handbag</li>
    <li> I use this daily. It has amazing pockets. I could just pull it out and put it in new purses as many time as I want. It hasn&#x27;t cause me any problems. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This bag is ok but the zippers did not unzip all the way to the end which was aggravating but it did fit in my purse and did items organized.</li>
    <li> This is a great organizer. It fits perfectly in my hand bags and keeps everything neatly organized. No longer have to search all over the bottom of my purse to find all those loose items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also GREAT price! Can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Love it. Will not do without one of these ever again. Gave one as a gift and it was really appreciated.</li>
    <li> This organizer is large enough to fit into a bigger purse and hold all sorts of things.  It has several pockets and compartments along with 2 zippered pockets lengthwise which are great for securing anything important.  The large open middle is big enough to hold a fill size wallet and make-up case.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping did take a while, considering where it&#x27;s coming from it should be expected.  It took approximately 3 weeeks for my shipment to arrive.  it&#x27;s worth it if you can wait and the price really can&#x27;t be beat.  I had been looking at some other more expensive products but I can say that I am happy with this one!</li>
    <li> this bag is so much better than I expected,there are so many pockets! Glad that I bought 2 of them, one lucky person will get a great gift.</li>
    <li> Ordered two of these, based on reviews. They are great for the money, but the material is so padded and thick that it filled my purse up completely. It works great in my Thirty-One bag, though!</li>
    <li> This organizer is perfect for purses but can be used just like organizers for anything, like handy stuff for camping! What was most impornant for me it has lots of pockets! Practical buy. I&#x27;m going to purchase couple more for gifts.</li>
    <li> I expected something a little more stiff, but this didn&#x27;t have much structural support. For 4 bucks though, this served its function in purses that are a little more stiff and can keep its own form. It&#x27;s not so good for floppy bags.</li>
    <li> So very little but very convenient....supports all my tools that I put in it! Love it! Not ever worried it&#x27;s gonna rip or anything</li>
    <li> I keep this in my purse to keep my stuff organized. I change purses a lot and this makes it so much easier to switch to a new purse.</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price, I paid less then four dollars.  I am thinking of getting a few for my girls-friends.</li>
    <li> I love how there are so many compartments, but one of the mesh pockets is already ripping :( It is not very durable.</li>
    <li> This is super easy to use, just be careful since the handles are badly sewn. I was putting it in my purse and the one handle just broke, luckily I was able to fix it myself. Otherwise I love it, it keeps all my stuff neatly packed in my purse without mixing things up, plus the zippers and side pouches are great for stashing small or more valuable stuff.</li>
    <li> This is an inexpensive organizer.  It has many small pockets with two large zippered pockets on each side.  The middle area can be expanded or snap closed and it came with two short handles so you can carry as a bag.  While the quality control is lacking (the stitches are not even), it is cheap enough to be overlooked.  The bag has light insulation so it can be bit bulky if you are using it as your handbag organizer (as I had originally intended).  I now use it as my craft/sewing bag, easy to carry everywhere I go.  I bought a couple of them to give away to my family.  The shipping was free but the delivery was very slow.  (It took a month to receive my order because it was shipped from Hong Kong.)  I wasn&#x27;t in a hurry, so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.  Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This organizer is AWESOME.  It&#x27;s not too big by any means (like some of the reviews).  If your bag is too small for this organizer, then why would you even need an organizer?!  This is perfect for people like me who likes big purses, and likes to switch purses regularly.  It&#x27;s well made.  It has many many pockets.  It keeps all my stuff in place. I no longer have to look for things in my purse like a needle in haystack.  Big plus is that switching purses is now super convenient.  I&#x27;ve ordered more as bday presents for my family.  highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the idea and it works... I often change purses ans all I have to do is move the bag from one purse to another, not missing anything ever. Took a lot to get here (about a month and a half) but was worth waitting for it.</li>
    <li> Its really nice. Holds a lot of stuff. Has many places to put things. Zippers, slots and little pockets. Easy to pull out of your bag and easy to put back in.</li>
    <li> I love the organiser insert!  It helps keep everything in place in my purse.  Love all the pockets to keep everything organized!!</li>
    <li> I have used this organizer for over a year now and absolutely love it.  I love having pockets for various things inside my purse. Many of the purses now are great big bags and everything just gets jumbled inside.  This solves that problem.</li>
    <li> Good product - helps w/organization</li>
    <li> I purchased a hand bag that was rather large....so I purchased the &amp;#34;pouch bag in bag organizer&amp;#34; and it was just what I&lt;br /&gt;needed to organizer my purse.  I highly recommend this organizer it.</li>
    <li> Lots of pockets. light weight. and Cheap!</li>
    <li> Bought as gifts for the ladies of our church, those who responded love it!</li>
    <li> This was a good product but not what I was looking for. I gave it to Goodwill and I am sure someone found a great use for it.</li>
    <li> Works great but it is already fraying at the edges.</li>
    <li> It took FOREVER to arrive and when it did, it was as large as the purse I was hoping to use with it!!</li>
    <li> This is what I&#x27;m looking for, something to put all bits and pieces in each pocket and in one bag. It&#x27;s light and hope it will last.</li>
    <li> It is handy and helpful with many pouches. Exactly what I thought I was getting. Came on day promised. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Never really thought about purchasing something like this but I am so happy I did. Know I can find everything easily. Switching from one handbag to another is a breeze with the small handles that are sewn in. The quality is very good and the stitching is also. Would highly recommend this organizer.</li>
    <li> I use to hold my make up in and it keeps everything very well organized and easy to find. I am pleased with my purchase and it came in good time and in good shape.</li>
    <li> For months I was searching for a new purse, thinking that was going to solve by purse disaster. I couldn&#x27;t find a purse with enough pockets or one that didn&#x27;t cost several hundred dollars. I came across when I searched for purse organizer. I don&#x27;t carry a lot in my purse but everything I have is small and the purses I have seem to swallow all my items in my bag. I was getting so frustrated looking for my cell, keys, credit cards, wallet and the list goes on. Anyhow, this is perfect for me and I recommend it for anyone tired of searching through their purse.</li>
    <li> this is okay.  very light weight thin, cheap material.  zipper is cheap plastic and bulky on the thin fabric, it is kind of hard to zip.</li>
    <li> This bag was a higher quality than what I thought that I&#x27;d get from China, as I buy from China all the time.  It has a lot of pockets and storage, and it fit perfect in my bag.  I like that it has 2 zipper compartments for a more secure bag.  It is helpful, and can go from purse to purse.  The price was great, and I am so glad that I took the chance and bought it!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed..</li>
    <li> The exact dimensions of this bag are 18&amp;#34; x 11&amp;#34; x 6.75&amp;#34;. All of the colors were very vibrant except the Navy which looked somewhat muted. Very lightweight with a matte finish and a saffiano-style print on the exterior. The inner lining variest between bags--I believe the white has a black and white damask-style print, the black had a polka dot print, the yellow had a brown stripe print, etc. The top has a snap button closure. Excellent quality for the price and looks great in person.</li>
    <li> This little organizer is a must for every woman, especially for an unorganized, like me. It keeps all your tiny essentials at place and easy transfers them to another bag, in a matter of seconds! I love this organizer so much, so I bought 8 others for my friends and family!</li>
    <li> Love this sweater!! Very light. And I like that. I tend to run warm.. The upper color is much brighter than picture. That being said , I still love it. My wardrobe tends to be a bit dark ...</li>
    <li> Great for organizing all of those little things that get thrown in your purse.</li>
    <li> I bought this with the intention of putting in a purse, however I ended up not using it for that purpose as it didn&#x27;t fit my purse well. I purchased a few of them due to the low price point and I have used them for crafts, toiletries, and to store items in the car for my kids to play with. For this price, you can&#x27;t beat the quality. Tons of pockets - I am overall very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I received my organizer and it came a week earlier than expected.  Yeah!  I just love it!  I have a table next to my chair, that was always getting messed up, no matter how many times I would pick it up.  The cat would jump up and of course knock things over as well.  Now every thing is in it&#x27;s own little place and no more clutter!  I also bought one for my purse.  A little bit tight for my purse, but we&#x27;ll see if I let it stay or not.  As for the handles, I just don&#x27;t use them. No need to, as far as I can see!  Kind of a dumb thing to give a bad rating for something so trivial.</li>
    <li> I love this organizer for my handbag with all of its pockets and especially was pleased with the low price.  It did take quite a long time to get to me but it was well worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Definitely helps. Plus, I absolutely love pockets! How many purses come with enough pockets? I&#x27;ve always said, you can never have too many of them!</li>
    <li> Cheap material, flimsy. It was teared up with a few weeks of use. The size is not your average-size purse friendly.</li>
    <li> This was possibly the best $4 I ever spend in my entire life. This item I have used constantly since I got it many , many months ago and it has held up, it is made very sturdy, the zippers are almost impossible to destroy , the many pockets have not ripped .This thing is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold if you are like me and religiously switch out your handbags to match your outfits .This bag for the bag fits into my smallest trapeze shoulder bag and makes my largest tote organized. You know there your stuff is with the two secure zippered sections , the outside has deep pockets , on top of those are more mesh pockets so you see what you need, let&#x27;s say you want to carry your rollerball perfumes, makeup for touch ups etc. , its easy to find, and best of all.... If you do have something that spills , it will not ruin your precious bag !</li>
    <li> Bought the bag which arrived super fast.  I didn&#x27;t open the package a couple weeks later.  But found that the item was a bit damaged.  The seller was incredibly responsive and super helpful.  S/he immediately arranged another bag out right away without questions asked.  A truly honorable seller-extremely trustworthy!  Not to mention the item helps my bag stay super organized and clean. Changing bags are no longer a big task.  I just hoped it wasn&#x27;t so soft but rather has a stronger support.  I use it everyday!</li>
    <li> I like carrying a lot of stuff in my bag... this pouch bag has not only made my purse very neat and organized it has made my life easy. I can simply switch this between bags and easily find everything. Shipping takes too long though.</li>
    <li> Everyone that I know has one of these. If you have a large purse, or need a bit more organization in a tote, or school bag, these work great and they are not expensive at all. You can buy ore expensive ones, but what for? grey matches everything, especially Inside of a bag. great gifts, personal use, love them. The zippers are plastic and kind of flimsy but if you&#x27;re gentle it wont get hung up, or just leave the zipper open....so worth the three dollars and the two week wait</li>
    <li> this is a great buy I am planning to buy more for my friends and family. shipping was on time it is very convenient, just pull out and place in your favorite purse</li>
    <li> Very useful and makes life all the more easier, but after awhile, your bag becomes really heavy. I&#x27;d advise to pack light or use it inside your backpack ;)</li>
    <li> Did everything I needed to organize my bucket bags &amp; hobos.</li>
    <li> aspin, band-aids, keys, wallet, iPod, earphones, phone, adaptors, flash drive, pens, hand cream, etc.  I don&#x27;t like to take my office bag on vacations, so this is great for going from work to vacation tote.  It&#x27;s pretty small though. Take a look at the measurements and make sure it&#x27;s not too small for your needs.</li>
    <li> I recently had a baby and was looking something to move back and forth between by diaper bag and purse to save me from carrying both when out and about with baby. I carry a fairly large purse and this pouch is large enough to hold most of what I carried regularly in my purse and I can easily transfer back and forth. Plus it is much more organized.  When I need something, I don&#x27;t have to fish around in the bottomless pit that is my purse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price I have been very pleased with the quality.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD ORGANIZER FOR POCKET BOOKS.</li>
    <li> If organization is what you need, this product is for you. Product is made well and should hold up. I keep all my essentials in this organizer which makes it super easy to change handbags.</li>
    <li> I like this purse organizer but.....too many pockets,  also the zippers could be less obvious ( too big &amp; brite yellow).  Other than that I love it!</li>
    <li> Has lots of pockets for storage and nice size, just wish they had more color options.</li>
    <li> Really like these, Thanks</li>
    <li> The size kind of misleading</li>
    <li> very nice and so much better than i thought it would be</li>
    <li> Still can&#x27;t find things in the purse!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this organizer it fits my purse perfect and has lots of pockets, 2 zippered and one middle part. i like it a lot. good purchase for me.</li>
    <li> this is just like the pink one no difference except color, disappointed</li>
    <li> great bag and it fits in my purse.  everything has a place. its great. love the pockets and two zippered ones.  wish it came in other colors.  this is great when i have to change purses. just lift out and put in another purse.</li>
    <li> I really like the design of this purse.  It has lots of pockets and a double zipper pouch.  The material is nice, too.  I bought 1 purse.  The lining inside the purse was not completely sewn together.  I wanted to return it, but as another reviewer mentioned, the shipping back to HK costs more than the product itself.  If it weren&#x27;t for the lining not completely sewn, it would be an awesome purse.  I used super glue to glue the lining inside the purse.  Hope it holds up.</li>
    <li> Great little organizers!</li>
    <li> Be careful about the size as they have many available sizes. A large one will not fit into a smaller purse (well duh!). It is very convenient to switch purses using this gizmo. Very light and good zippers.</li>
    <li> This insert bag is PERFECT for carrying my harmonicas inside my messenger bag. I LOVE THIS BAG!!!&lt;br /&gt;There are  6 small outer pockets + 4 additional larger outer pockets and with lots of interior space too. unbelievable!</li>
    <li> These little gems were $3.00 apiece.  I bought lots of them and gave them away as gifts.  Makeup, electrical cords, flash drives for college, index cards, jewelry. .. just about any and everything goes into the two zippered compartments and the central compartment is open.  Then the price started to go up.  I don&#x27;t know how much they are now, but for $3 when I bought them they were a great buy.</li>
    <li> Oh my one of my best purchased I recently went to a larger purse&lt;br /&gt;and being embarrased when I had to look for a tiny item way in the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;Literally would have to dump the whole purse out.  Not any more, everything&lt;br /&gt;stays in place, good quality.  Just love it.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome and really works. It holds up well and it totally worth the little cost and wait.</li>
    <li> Very nice bag for travel. I use it every time I travel to overseas for the last few years. Will order more as gifts for the holidays.</li>
    <li> The zippers, however, don&#x27;t work very well and you have to play with them to get the compartments fully zipped.</li>
    <li> never arrived, I feel it was a scam, they should do something about it.&lt;br /&gt;I should return the money, do not think just what I have done&lt;br /&gt;I should return the money, do not think just what I have done</li>
    <li> I like it. Use it every time when travel. It is spacious. its is nice. Seemed to be low quality for such a price but its good.</li>
    <li> Looking for a bag organizer and not willing to pay a lot, this is definitely for you. It is not cheap made, looks very nice, to be honest much better than what I expected. I enjoy having it.</li>
    <li> Love it,would rather it be black but this will do if I couldn&#x27;t have black. It has more little places to put things things than you could imagine. GREAT BUY&lt;br /&gt; Thanks</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the entire service this seller provided me with. It was exactly what I ordered and in very good quality! I was supposed to get it later in the month and I got it in the middle which was an awesome surprise! This is really durable purse organizer for an incredible price!!! I would definitely recommend this product for anyone who wants to buy it!</li>
    <li> For the price, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but it turned out to be a really nice insert.  Not to mention that gray/yellow is my favorite color combination.</li>
    <li> For its price you can&#x27;t go wrong. I should have bought extra for Xmas gifts next year! I love it</li>
    <li> Got to get me another one for my mother in law, she loved it too and wanted  mine  Thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this to put in my car. It has all kinds of pockets. Thank you i just might order more</li>
    <li> This is MUCH nicer than those nasty, poorly-made Kangaroo Keepers. The bag expands to hold a lot and keeps things organized with well thought out pockets. There are two zip compartments to keep small items from falling out and ending up in the bottom of a purse. The material is soft and flexible, so when you don&#x27;t have much in the bag, it will compress and take up less space in the purse. It also doesn&#x27;t crack like plastic organizers. The loop handles are surprisingly helpful. I&#x27;m ordering a few more.</li>
    <li> I got this in the mail last night and stayed up late putting things in my purse in it. Everything fits and I know that when I need to take it out of my purse and put in the baby bag that I will have everything I need!</li>
    <li> The Sodial Handbag Organizer is great!  It&#x27;s a little bigger than I expected, which is a plus. It has lots of pockets and even zips. I live it!</li>
    <li> Best purse organizer I have seen.  First one I was ever tempted to buy.  Long delivery time because it is shipped from China, but well worth it--price is incredible.  The only thing to be aware of is that it needs a larger purse than I realized.  I do have a couple favorites that are the right size.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Yes, all the reviews that say their is a smell to it is right, but all you have to do is take it out of the bag it comes in and let it air out for a couple of days. My purse is 12x8 and it fits perfect.</li>
    <li> More pockets than the pictures show, easy to clean. Great for organizing a diaper bag, beach tote, personal drawer at work, gym locker, etc.</li>
    <li> I switch bags often and this organizer goes from one bag to another with ease. It is a nice size and has handles to pull it out without spilling things.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and light, and it&#x27;s as shown in the picture. There are a few lose threats, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. For under 5 bucks, I really can&#x27;t ask for a better deal. My only complaint? There are so many pockets, now I have to develop a system and remember which holds what!</li>
    <li> I like this organizer. the size is perfect, It is bigger that I have now. Also two  zipper compartments are excellent to put something important. This organizer is good for the medium or large bag.&lt;br /&gt;The best one is the price. I shocked with the price they gave and also free shipping.</li>
    <li> Fast and easy business! Just the way I like it! I has no problems, and handbag pouch couldn&#x27;t be any more perfect.</li>
    <li> Just received the bag this week, so I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it yet.  I always shop for purses that have several compartments in them, but they are getting harder to find, so I decided to give this a try.  It is very well made, hardly any odor as others had mentioned, and cushiony in the middle.  Really like the snaps to expand the size.  Would have gotten 5 stars if it had been black instead of drab grey with yellow zippers.  Great deal for the price!  I had been looking at other types that were at least $15.00.</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the best decisions i&#x27;ve made this year. It keeps things neat and tidy. I can fit ALOT in this bag. I use big/med purses and this fits perfectly. I have everything in this pouch. Several pens,penicls ,large note pad, samsung tablet, phone, charger, wallet, tissues, passport, reciepts, feminine items, gum, calculator, and still have plenty room left in the pouch and my purse. I would higly recommend. I will be ordering more in other colors. Love this! Love this! Had to come back and review it. I just got it today, 4 weeks early i might add.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 thumbs up!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Just got the product today. Zippers did not work well at all, they keep getting hung up.  The stiching on one of the pockets was loose.  Not high quality, may just thow it away.</li>
    <li> The bag organizer is much nicer than I expected, especially given the low price.  It&#x27;s very sturdy and has oodles of storage space. :-)</li>
    <li> What a great price for a great product. I rarely change purses because it is such a pain to move everything and inevitably I forget to move something important. This product makes changing purses a breeze! Lots of great compartments as well! True, this won&#x27;t fit in all of my purses, but it fits in the ones I use most often. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It took a while for me to get this bag, but it&#x27;s from Hong Kong so it&#x27;s ok. When u got it in the mail I was pleasantly surprised! This bag is so durable yet soft and made well, it has lots of pockets and zippers perfect for a portable shower bag, or make up holder, or anything really in going to use it to carry all my hair accessories and make up and jewelry to take with me to photoshoota</li>
    <li> My mom ordered this and can not stop raving about it. It keeps her so well organized. If you need your purse to stay organized this is the perfect solution.</li>
    <li> I do not have small purses, but this is so big that it is hard to put into even my big one</li>
    <li> Works great. Whoever invented this was a genius. Love it.  I bought two so I can give one to my friends</li>
    <li> Really can not make a review without both of the items I ordered.  The gray one looks great and has many neat divided areas.</li>
    <li> great price with great product! about 3 weeks I got it. nice! but organize my bag pretty well! I really like it</li>
    <li> I bought 3 of these so I will give them away as a christmas present. When i received my orders, i totally liked them! Very presentable! I ended up ordering more! :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nicely made and I received it WEEKS before it was promised!!  I like the design and the material.  I plan to cut a piece of foam core to put in the bottom.  I think it will make it more functional for my needs with a &amp;#34;stand on it&#x27;s on&amp;#34; bottom, otherwise it&#x27;s great.  Really blown away by the shipping.</li>
    <li> Soft, expandable, solid construction.  I can fit in all my handbags and quickly.  Delivery took a long time.  So easy to access mp3, cell and kindle.  Love the web like side pockets for lipstick, etc.  I like to change handbags often so this is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product that will make my life easier!  It did take a little while to ship to me, but once it was here I&#x27;ve been nothing but satisfied.</li>
    <li> This one took a while to get, but it did come from Hong Kong, after all. I still can&#x27;t believe that it was as inexpensive as it was. Definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> This pouch is nice, but a little large to fit in all of my purses.  It seemed like it had more pockets than it actually does.  But it is helpful for the small things and not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> This is just OK.  The zipper isn&#x27;t good quality and gets stuck, but then I didn&#x27;t pay much for it.  It will serve its purpose.</li>
    <li> The item was high quality and was delivered very quickly.  Very pleased with the item.  It is very well made.  I put one in my locker at work to organize my &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> it is as described.. i put everything in here except for my wallet and put it in my big bag.. so much easier to find my stuff in a large bag.. definitely worth it..</li>
    <li> I have yet to use my new handbag but it is sturdy &amp; has alot of room for all my stuff.  I,m looking forward to trying it out.</li>
    <li> I love how many pockets it has. It works great to keep my purse organized. I like the gray color and the yellow accents.</li>
    <li> This was a great deal.  I wish I had ordered more.  Send more offers like this one.  It really helps.</li>
    <li> Good quality and helpful. I use this in the backpack that I carry in lieu of a baby bag and then I just pull it out when I don&#x27;t want to carry the backpack into stores or other places but where I still need my wallet, etc.</li>
    <li> This organizer was purcahsed on a whim for my extremely large Fossil bag which has been dubbed the Mary Poppins bag. I lose and find everything in it, it&#x27;s a huge huge bag. Using this, I keep track of everything and there&#x27;s no mess anymore! It&#x27;s hidden, so no one can see it, and I purchased two because I want to keep a spare for when this one wears out. Construction looks great, easy to wipe off, many, many pockets. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> bought this for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;very handy and was put in to use almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;quality of material and workmanship is good.</li>
    <li> Lots of pocket and the perfect size for a tote bag.  Although is was shipped internationally, it didn&#x27;t take long to receive.</li>
    <li> The puch bag fits perfectly in my bag and I no longer have to go digging around for my items. The price was just right and the material is perfect, just in case it gets wet. I purchased 2 and my daughter has switched purses a few times, and love the idea of not having to re-organize her purse.</li>
    <li> This is a very well made product that makes it easy to organize your purse. All you need to do when changing purses is pick up the organizer by it&#x27;s handles and insert into next handbag. Lots of different sized compartments. A really nice surprise for a reasonable price. Hope they make this is a few different sizes. Will defiantly order more for gifts.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t something you would want everyone to see.  It does the job inside so your purse looks nice on the outside.</li>
    <li> I am very, very happy with this organizer. Other purse organizers I had never seemed to be sturdy enough or keep the same shape which is important if you put them in a large purse so I was very pleasantly surprised by this one. It&#x27;s very good quality for the price, it keeps its shape and has plenty of room to organize all your stuff. It also has snaps both on top and on the bottom to make it wider or narrower depending on how much stuff you need to put in (mine are always open:) and two zipped compartments in addition to the middle one. Highly recommend it, it&#x27;s a step above all the other ones you can get out there.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived before the supposed arrival date.</li>
    <li> This bag was smaller then I expected but that&#x27;s really my fault because I should have read the dimensions more carefully.  It does have great pockets but here&#x27;s my problem - one of the outside pockets tore up the side within the first month so it is now useless.  I guess for something under $10 what can you expect?</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Now I could change bags easily because all of my stuff is in one place and I just remove the organizer and put it in my new bag.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect for the price,but I was pleasantly surprised. The organizer is very roomy and fits my medium size bag perfectly, so it mignt be a litte too big for small bags if you are planning to carry extra items in addition to the organizer.All in all,I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Just received the bag and very very disappointed. Of course, I did not expect a perfect bag at this price, but the bag is even worse than what I thought. Poor workmanship， bad quality</li>
    <li> A great organizer for messy purse... it is not the best organizer but its definitely worth the price paid... Shipping takes a while but it does deliver...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing i liked is the material its made of is light weight, so it doesn&#x27;t add much weight to the purse being carried and the chains are very sturdy.</li>
    <li> We bought these for presents, and they have been happily received.  We gave one to my cousin full of grooming items so he could carry it back and forth when he comes to stay with us.  He was carrying everything in a paper bag.  He thanked us many times.  Another we gave to one of our sons to carry in his car.  We filled it with medical emergency items.  He has 2 small boys and appreciated this gift.&lt;br /&gt;These bags are made well.  They &#x27;look&#x27; efficient, and they are.  I would recommend them to people.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I give them a 4 instead of a 5, is just because there are much more attractive bags out there.  These get a 5 for efficiency and quality.  They serve the purpose well.</li>
    <li> For the price it is worth it. I just have to get rid of stuff.  I would buy again. Took a long time to arrive.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very handy size and perfect for the short distance I travel once a month. The sturdy fabric wipes easily.</li>
    <li> I think the insert is great. The one fault I found with it is the stitches separating the pockets on the outside are  not strong enough and are tearing. I can repair it myself but they should use a heavier duty thread to sew it. Otherwise, the fabric and  the zippers are of good quality. I would definitely purchase another.</li>
    <li> Your going to have to wait for this one longer than usual, but for the price you cant beat it!</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be poorly/cheaply made considering how inexpensive it was, but it actually was made with no flaws and looks just like in the picture!  It is very versatile.  I happen to use it to keep all my smaller technology devices and their chargers (in the various compartments).  It has been great!</li>
    <li> Item came quickly from overseas and I started using it right away.  Lots of pockets for storage.  It moves from purse to purse easily.</li>
    <li> Great item has many pockets and you could not beat the price. It fits all of my pocketbooks perfect, easy in easy out.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for easily switching bags, has many pockets for keeping things organized.  Also has two small handles on the top to easily remove bag.  It also has snaps on the sides to make it smaller for narrower bags.  And, this vendor shipped amazingly fast - good product!</li>
    <li> These are great small storage bags. I used this in my craft area, not in a purse. I should get another one for organization in my van. small and helpful, plus durable. I&#x27;d definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> I was expecting something more structured...this is a basic nylon floppy bag. It is great though to help keep a bag organized...especially for a hobo or other big bag</li>
    <li> I really like this organizer . It arrived late and damaged. Hopefully , there will be a replacement on its way. Not happy at all.</li>
    <li> This is so unique and nice for the purse, so glad I saw it.  Got one for me and one for my daughter.</li>
    <li> I can take it or leave it</li>
    <li> I am not too thrilled with the colors but it has definitely served its purpose! It has lots of pockets &amp; has improved the process of &#x27;digging&#x27; in my purse!</li>
    <li> It took a little time to receive it but it really works and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I bought 3. Poor quality, one has a bottom seam not sewed. Would be a great product if designed better.</li>
    <li> Call me stupid ... I ordered 3 of these from 3 different vendors at Amazon.  It was late one night, they were cheap, thought they would be handy for various organization needs ... blah, blah, blah.  But to be honest they all had different discriptions &amp; prices.  I hoped they would vary in size (some descriptions were inches others used words like large.  NOPE - they are all small.&lt;br /&gt;So they ended up being exactly the same, except for the color.&lt;br /&gt;One zipper broke the day I got the pouch.  They are flimsy &amp; flip about in my tote.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend them - any of them.</li>
    <li> I love this pouch it holds everything that is in my purse and I can find everythng right away . I  reccomend this item to all my frineds</li>
    <li> This is the worst! It came smashed into a too-small envelope and the zippers don&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s an absolute piece of junk! The zippers are also HUGE and it&#x27;s very ugly. Not at all what I expected. The seller wouldn&#x27;t give me a refund.</li>
    <li> Great price for this organizer.  Not as large as I imagined it to be, but still has plenty of spots for all the little things I carry.  I love being able to move it from one purse to another, or sticking it in a tote bag for a road trip.  Since it came from out of the states it took longer for delivery.</li>
    <li> This item fits everything that was dumped into my purse and then some.  I would recommend this product if you have a large purse and want to keep everything together.  Gives you more space for water bottles, milk bottles and diapers.</li>
    <li> I use this at work as an ER RN - its perfect for the small workstations i can keep everything i need right there. I totally recommend this! It has the two zippered pockets that actually can hold quite a bit and has withstood quite a bit of abuse already!</li>
    <li> I ave been looking for something like this for some time as I like to change purses frequently and it is a hassle if you carry as much stuff as I do...most of the inserts I have looked at aren&#x27;t big enough..Amazon has come through with this one which holds a ton of stuff..my only reservation is that it is kind of ugly..however when in use it can&#x27;t been seen so that is ok</li>
    <li> Very poor quality zipper and material. Overall cheap build. Cannot be neatly used for travels. Using it just because I bpought it.,</li>
    <li> The quality is as expected or maybe a little better, Shipping time is long. Not a bad product, but I am not using it as it does not hold as much as I need.</li>
    <li> I would like this more if the insert was deeper.  Once you place the insert into your pocketbook, items can spill out.  Insert needs to be taller.</li>
    <li> THis is a GREAT purse organizer.  It is a bit large for some purses, but overall it is good and keeping things better organized and easier to find in my purse.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. I typically cannot do one compartment purses because I crave organization. I recently purchased a really cute name brand purse lately but hated that it was a one compartment purse. I always felt like it took entirely too long to find things in my purse. I was thrilled when this arrived! I immediately put it in my purse &amp; now I can easily find everything in my purse. For the price, you really cannot beat it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is the lengthy shipping time but for the price, I really didn&#x27;t mind once I received my product. It was worth the wait. I have purchased from this seller before, so I knew what to expect with the shipping. Free shipping comes at a cost sometimes. I noticed other reviews mention issues with quality but my product was not lacking in quality. These will make great Christmas gifts!</li>
    <li> The zipper broke the first couple of times I used it! To small for my purse. was very cheaply made!</li>
    <li> the handles unravelled after short use.</li>
    <li> It is excellent for maintaining order in the handbag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very useful accessory that helps keep everything in order into to the handbag.</li>
    <li> So... I waited a while for these to arrive but they were definitely worth it.  It makes switching handbags a breeze and I can find things now.  Glad I bought these.</li>
    <li> One for diaper bag and one for my purse. Well one is still intact while the other one is already getting ripped on the edge where the outside mesh pocket. That was only with a week or two of good use. Maybe it would have held up better if items aren&#x27;t so heavy. Not sure, debating if I should return or not.</li>
    <li> The picture shows a gray pouch bag but the one I got was bright green, almost neon.  No real issue with that since it goes inside my bag.  I would recommended this for medium or large bags/purses.  The zipper and clips were plastic, it would be more durable if they were metal but for the price, this is an excellent product.  It was delivered in 2 weeks, which was reasonable.</li>
    <li> This pouch bag was pretty much what I expected. I carry large (LARGE) purses, so this is a good way to keep all the &amp;#34;little things&amp;#34; in one place so I don&#x27;t have to search all over hell&#x27;s half acre for a lipstick or my cell phone, or whatever. The only thing I&#x27;m not thrilled about is the color - would&#x27;ve preferred something a little more &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;, but this was all they offered, and let me tell you, it was a GREAT DEAL. There are tons of pouches and pockets, too. All in all, a good buy. I&#x27;d order it again, and if the color selection was better, I&#x27;d be giving them as gifts.</li>
    <li> Just put in all of purse stuff and now I&#x27;m able to switch fashion bags quickly on the run.  Thx!</li>
    <li> The design of the bag is good. It has many compartments, so you can easily seperate your items. I would also like to point out that it came two weeks earlier than the estimated delivery date, which made me happy! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I didn&#x27;t like was the area of the mesh-like material. They sewed it so that part can be seperated into small sections, as shown in their picture, but ont he actual product the sewing is slightly slanted. It isn&#x27;t slanted to a point where you can&#x27;t use it, but just be aware of that when buying this item.</li>
    <li> Great bag to move around to other purses. It is not at all pretty but very handy. I would recommend if you are like me and always digging around in your purse to find something.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help organize my purse. I have a big wallet, so that&#x27;s tough to fit in there. The industrial look of the organizer leaves things to be desired, but overall it works as it was intended.</li>
    <li> I have it my purse and I even purchased a back up. I like that everything stays put in it and I can just swap purses or what ever and still fits well. Of course, it wont fit a small bag or purse, this is more for medium to large bags.</li>
    <li> I finally have a &amp;#34;purse&amp;#34; of my own. Or at least I can find what I&#x27;m looking for, such as my wallet, keys and phone. I just slip this in my diaper bag. Love the colors (gray and yellow are right up my alley). It&#x27;s well made and I adore it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weird thing was it came directly from Hong Kong with postage on the package and everything. Not often you get international mail directly and not through a third party. It adds to the story.</li>
    <li> ok it was more than i expected good item truly dont know why I didint get it sooner  &amp;#34;)  l}</li>
    <li> Love it. Easy to transfer from one purse to another. Keep stuff organized so it is ready to find. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised, given how cheap they were, but these are even uglier in real life!  I ended up donating them as they weren&#x27;t worth it to ship back.  I guess if you had a large tote or toiletries bag that needed some pockets it would be ok, but they weren&#x27;t nice enough for me to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good price ,good quality,fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light, easy to use,fit most of purse, I very happy with what I get.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful little organizer for my handbag.  It&#x27;s going to make changing bags a lot easier.  I&#x27;ve seen several other bag organizers for a lot more money so, when I saw yours I thought I would give it a try and I&#x27;m so glad I did, it&#x27;s light weight and easy to move from one bag to another.  I will recommend this product to several of my friends. I would like to see this in other colors.</li>
    <li> This is so super handy in the diaper bag!! Wish I would have bought 2, . . . . .</li>
    <li> I like to have things in order all the time. My bag was one of the things was exception from my own role. I am very happy I took the decision to buy this little pouch because it helps a lot and make my bag much more organized and at any time i go inside, i know exactly where to find whatever i look for. Especially if your bag is little bigger ( like mine) and you  have a million of things in it, you will be very happy with this buy.  It really keeps your bag organized.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this in and out of about thirty different purses in the couple yrs since I&#x27;ve bought it. Made extremely well, and it&#x27;s up to you if you like it better inside out or vice versa. The compartments are the perfect size to organize ALL of your purse/daily essentials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is THE answer for those great looking bucket &amp; hobo bags without any decent compartments inside them, so all your things don&#x27;t end up in the bottom in a huge mess. I love that I can pull this out of one bag, and slip it over into another bag to match my outfits to my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use one side for all my makeup pencils, lip gloss, mascara, etc. Use the other side&#x27;s large compartment for travel toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, Advil, and band aids/pill box. The smaller inside sections hold keys, cards, cell phone and checkbook, pens, stick-it notes and coupons. You won&#x27;t believe how MUCH these things will hold and organize for you!! They seriously look good enough to use as a little carry bag all alone if you&#x27;re hitting the gym or doing a quickie trip to the market, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to get ten or so and give them out to co-workers for gifts. It&#x27;s that good, it&#x27;s that affordable, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed! I&#x27;d give this ten stars if possible!!</li>
    <li> I felt this made my pocketbook too squished inside.  I ordered a 2nd one for a friend and she loves it.  She used to carry a makeup bag with her stuff but this holds everything.</li>
    <li> Works great and definitely recommend to other users to buy.  Received on time and fits great in my purse.  :)</li>
    <li> Is a decent product, but would like it to be larger.  Not sure why it took so long to arrive.</li>
    <li> This item is wonderful, it helps organize my brief case and I can use it in any bag or purse. Thank you for this smart item!</li>
    <li> its great but the bag needs to be bigger but i like it.. my product came 4 weeks after i order it</li>
    <li> My purse looks so much in ordered and organized now, and I switch purse almost everyday! just pull the whole pouch out and hop! purse switched :)</li>
    <li> Received as advertised from China.</li>
    <li> This product is very good: quality is good, service was nice, and ship was ok. It is sutable with my think before I got it.</li>
    <li> Was expecting a sturdier structure; it does have a lot of pockets. Wanted to use it as a organizer for my purse but it collapses.</li>
    <li> I like that it has so many oppening with zips plus it is colapsible too.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to people who need their purse organized</li>
    <li> I bought this pouch a few weeks ago to be able to switch purses easily.  But, the materials was so cheap that as soon as I opened up the pouch to view the interior, the material ripped immediately.  Never have I seen a fabric shred so easily.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> This is a very good organizer, yes it is!, and yeah it is a little large, and this is not about measuring things, I dont go out and measure with a rule when I am buying a bag, cosmetics, hair brushes, notepads, etc. I believe in this case is a reference to make an idea in my mind... Ok, I have to confess... I sort of take a rule to give myself an idea when I first saw it here in Amazon, and then I thought to measure my bags, but at these point  I thought: &amp;#34;Nah, it&#x27;ll be just fine&amp;#34;. And well, it fits almost all of my bags... of course not all of them... but thats not a problem!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I dont understand is how is it possible this is a small price with no shipping cost, very good for me but... I am kind of feeling bad for this, when I first saw it  I did not really believed I was going to get exactly the picture for that amount of money. Well I got it!  Mmm I dont really know what should I do in the future about buying thing at these price, I think I will feel better if I pay shipment cost at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you are doubtful because of the size: well, you can get a rule or you can also see the 2 hands of the person are far apart, this will give you an idea of how long it is. Anyway I have to congratulate the person or the group of people who though this idea, I would not ever come to this: Congrats its a great idea! Now I can have easily reach my stuff  (beginning for my really hard to find: house keys and my cellphone no matter how hard it sounds ...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think also could be a great idea making a smaller version of it.&lt;br /&gt;I purchase 4 in grey color, and I would like to buy in pink, blue, green and purple :)</li>
    <li> I like to be organized.This helps my purse be so as well. Lots of compartments to put those little things we carry with us daily. I carry a big bag and things do get lost in it, this organizer bag works to keep that form happening. Shipping was slow, but on time. packaging was good.</li>
    <li> This plastic/vinyl bag was shipped within 3 weeks of buying.  It is functional and easy to use in a large pouch type handbag with no built in organizer.  I don&#x27;t know how long it will last -  but with care, it might last several seasons of periodic use.  I am happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> took a little while for it to get here, but I Love it...I carry LARGE purses and keeping them organized was almost impossible, but not anymore!! Very nicely put together and WONDERFUL price.</li>
    <li> I received it today, and it was awesome! i didnt know what to put inside, it fits in my bags nicely and i like the color and feel of the material. I like how it can expand larger if you have more stuff to put in it. thank you, and for the price, its awesome!</li>
    <li> Based on the price, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this product.  However, when it arrived I was very pleasantly surprised! It is great quality.  I can&#x27;t wait to use it!</li>
    <li> This item was as described but was a bit too long for wife&#x27;s handbag and tended to make bag buldge when filled with retired handbag items.</li>
    <li> It is a good buy considering the low price. I just hoped that it had a zipper in the middle compartment too, but overall, it does what it says.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok organizer, nothing really special, but seems to be sturdy enough, especially for the price. I used it once for traveling, and found it to suit my needs.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical ordering overseas.  It arrived much sooner than promised.  These inserts are wonderful for a LV Speedy style handbag.  Nothing gets lost in the abyss.  Just take it out and change handbags.  I would recommend this for a larger handbag at least 12 to 14 inches long.  I have a smaller one by Lori Greneir which has been discontinued for a shorter handbag.  Everything always stays neat and in the same place.  Luv Luv Luv!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s me switch purses (and even switch to a backpack) in one quick step.  Very handy.  four more words needed.</li>
    <li> I love it. Mine is well made. It has a ton of different pockets to put stuff into, 2 of them zip up. It also has 2 little handles to carry it by. It is perfect for trips and keeping everything in one place when you travel. I also use it when I take showers at the gym - it holds everything that I may need in there.</li>
    <li> The item has plenty of pockets which is great, but it&#x27;s a bit bulky and hard to get into if it&#x27;s full.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice that this makes changing purses easier, but it also works great in a brief case  for phone and computer accessories.</li>
    <li> Exactly what was needed.</li>
    <li> This is one of those things that every women must to use, because it let&#x60;s organize more than a bag</li>
    <li> The stitching comes loose almost immediately on the outside pockets. Otherwise it is a nice concept and cheap price. Just be ready to repair it.</li>
    <li> I use this in my beach bag to hold sunscreen, keys, phones, iPods, money etc. I love that is has two zippered pouches. I am going to purchase at least one more!</li>
    <li> A lightweight bad with good quality and a great price - I highly recommend it. Actually thinking of ordering another one just in case it runs out.</li>
    <li> I wanted one of these for quite a while and had seen one when I was in Florida over a year ago. However, I could not find one here in Ohio where I live most of the year. I recently went back to Florida and I was not able to find the organizer I had seen before. I was so disappointed. I decided to check online and to my surprise, I was able to find this one at such an affordable price. I was delighted and so far it seems to be very good. I love it. Keeps my purse organized so I can actually find things!</li>
    <li> The only thing that I was not expecting with the product is the flimsy material that the product was made out of.  Other than that it really is a wonderful design and will be well used in my possession.  I appreciated the cost the best.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Ths bag is to small my wallet could not fit in</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! it is smaller than it looks but it is super organizing and cool! i would recommend it! -A</li>
    <li> Nice little bag, if you want to go out and don&#x27;t want to lug a whole camera bag, but want to take your dslr.</li>
    <li> This is ok, I use it..but it really isn&#x27;t large enough for my purse, yes I carry a big purse, I carry my lunch, a book a notebook and it&#x27;s a carry all...I thought this would help me find things in my big purse...it does, but I think I need a bigger one, this one falls to the bottom and gets squished..I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars but it may be better for someone with a smaller big purse.</li>
    <li> Handbag organiser is an excellent way to keep your bag tidy and allows you to readily find any item in your bag.</li>
    <li> It took 2 months for me to receive this bag, it is an okay bag, the price is definitely worth it, If I had known it was going to take as long as it did to get the bag, I would have not ordered it.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a small purse person, skip this one. But then, you probably aren&#x27;t in the market for a purse organizer. This thing just fits in the biggest diameter purse I own -- both in width and height (it&#x27;s taller than I expected). But, that purse was the one that always turned into a black hole that swallowed exactly what I needed, so this is just what it needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing works and you get exactly what you see -- the side pockets are padded a bit which is nice for electronics. The zippers are plastic, but the pulls are that cheap metal that rusts quickly. However, the zippers work fine. And, the product is cheap to start out with, so overall, the quality is good for what you pay for it.</li>
    <li> I like the bag. However, when I received the item, the seam in one area was already loose. Also I had problem with zipping close one of the zippers. Other than that, it&#x27;s a good price but not good quality.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this for her and another for her mom. She was pleasantly surprised and found uses for every pocket. It fits great in her LV bag, and then she can also transfer it to her coach purse! What&#x27;s great about it is that it&#x27;s compact, not too big and not too small. You also don&#x27;t need it to transfer purses, you can just use it in one purse to organize your belongings. Her mom used it too and thinks it&#x27;s great! She likes how there are 4 tiny pockets on the side to hold lip gloss, or smaller items so they don&#x27;t fall out. The other side has 2 bigger pockets. This thing is great I can&#x27;t believe she never had it before. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Great for keeping purse organized and for switching from one purse to another.  Has side snaps to adjust for smaller purses. Quality is definitely good, not a name brand item but certainly not cheap and flimsy either.  Just right, especially for the price I paid.  Wish I had bought two.</li>
    <li> Not very good quality but works for what I wanted it for. Stitching missed in some places and a lot of loose thread.</li>
    <li> love it, lighter than one that I had purchased before, easy to transfer to other bags, lighter gray color makes purse not so dark inside.</li>
    <li> This item is just as described and I feel it will be exactly what I needed! I bought the others for gifts, and I know they will be appreciated.</li>
    <li> now my bag is organized!&lt;br /&gt;The price is very good and this item is good to be used for others as well!</li>
    <li> This was inexpensive.  Good quality.  I wish there were a few different size pockets, especially for sunglasses.  It&#x27;s a little large for my current purse, but I&#x27;m sure I will use it a lot in the years to come.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok not quite what I expected but will be able to put it to use. Feel the material is low grade but for what I paid I think I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. This thing had fallen apart coming out of the package. The sewing was low quality and several seams weren&#x27;t sewn... I couldn&#x27;t use this as a bag because one side was still loose.</li>
    <li> It works fine, looks as expected and fits in my purse. However, it took a long time to get here.</li>
    <li> It is light weight and has plenty of zippers. Will have to use with a medium to large size purse.&lt;br /&gt;It took several weeks to arrive.</li>
    <li> The pouch is awesome.  It really makes my large purse, that was a black hole that everything got lost inside, an organized storage bag.  The only complaint was that it took over 3 weeks for the item to be delivered.</li>
    <li> It is a must for travel. It has many pockets to hold various things. One place to find all I need.</li>
    <li> Gave it to my friend as a gift and she uses it in her purse and in her travel bag</li>
    <li> This product was true to its advertising, but doesn&#x27;t work for really big purses. I will have to buy a smaller purse to use this product.</li>
    <li> I have a big vinyl bag I use to commute to work on public transportation. I need a big durable bag because some days I need extra shoes or an umbrella. I take my lunch, a book or my iPad every day. This pouch allows me to keep my essentials organized and where I can find them instead of all mixed up in one big bag. I love it.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how well made this insert is and for this low price. I love it. It hold all my stuff and fits into most purses. I plan to order more as gifts and at least one extra for me.</li>
    <li> i am going to use it for my purse to keep things organized and for the price, it is fine...</li>
    <li> Item came sooner than stated. Quality was great and would recommend. Good item for packing items in suitcase as well as a purse.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. So handy! Well made! I had several little bags in my purse holding different items. It holds everything now and it is not bulky.</li>
    <li> Great item. Fit everything that I needed in there plus more. Will definitely recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.  I keep things more organized now in my purse.  I just wish the center zipped, but I just place my brushes there....I really like it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this handbag organizer insert yet, but it appears to be well made.  I have been looking for something like this for several years as I have this &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; purse that you just dump everything into and can never find anything.  I will be using this purse with the organizer in it very soon, and am looking forward to finding things in my bag much easier than before.</li>
    <li> For the price, it&#x27;s a steal of a deal. This bag fits all of my make up and has a ton of pockets and space. I really like it. I would have liked a more feminine color though.</li>
    <li> This is a great pouch you can take everywhere with you. I got 2, one for my on my travels and one for my baby son for his little things I need to take even on a walk. Lots fits in this little bag and it&#x27;s easy to clean as well. So worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love this organizer! I can change purses without having to leave anything behind. I use it for both school and work!</li>
    <li> I have some cute hobo bags that while I like the way they look, I just can&#x27;t find my stuff in when I use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that I can keep the stuff I always carry organized and easily switch bags. It is on the large size though so make sure the bag you want to put it in is deep enough and that the zipper compartment opens wide enough to not only get it in and out, but to access the items in it. Otherwise, you might opt for a smaller organizer.</li>
    <li> Product came quickly and was as described. It&#x27;s really convenient and easy to switch purses now. My only complaint is the yellow zippers. Obviously, I knew they were there from the picture, so I can&#x27;t complain too much. But when I put it in my smaller purses, they can be seen, which is not pretty. This is perfect for a bigger purse that it can hide down inside.</li>
    <li> Loved this product until... used it 1 month &amp; started to tear on outside pockets. If it was made with stronger material, it would get a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> I love it..it holds everything I need:) I can easily take it from one purse to another, without any hassle.</li>
    <li> Works great in my purses that don&#x27;t have enough pockets or compartments</li>
    <li> I love this organizer!  It is large enough to fit makeup in one pocket, personal items in other pocket,  and notepads, lists, menus in the middle.  Two pockets on outside hold lots also.  This allows me to actually change my purse more often!</li>
    <li> This little bag is awesome for he price! Its fits in almost all of my purses and orginizes everything for me, so now when I need something I&#x27;m not just digging around. I know exactly where everything is.</li>
    <li> Useful, versatile but I can&#x27;t use it with all my purses.</li>
    <li> I found them very cheap and not worth the wait.  Also they were too big for my purse.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know if I will buy from Amazon again.</li>
    <li> I like this purse organizer, wish it came in different colors. Was well worth the price. Would order again if a different color was offered.</li>
    <li> It took a while to get here, but it is exactly what it looks like, and I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Better than I expected for the price. The organizer is well done, has many pockets and fits my purse perfect. Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> It really doesn&#x27;t open up like the picture shows and the side compartments are very small.  Not great for a purse insert but maybe for toiletries when you travel.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly into a new handbag. Has mant pockets and compartments for great organization. Also, the price was exceptional. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Love this item wish I bought more than one great value for the price! Love that its expandable and can be moved to any bag.</li>
    <li> Very good price, very good item.&lt;br /&gt;Love it very very very very very very very very very very very much!</li>
    <li> holds everything I need in order - love it - holds more than I thought it would in a small purse</li>
    <li> very convenient... makes organizing your purse so easy. I am using it in a bag to carry electronic items.. works great</li>
    <li> This organizer is amazing for the price. It is pictured and described accurately.  There was no odor when removing it from the protective plastic, as other reviewers had noted. I was pleasantly surprised at the good quality of the material and workmanship.  The zippers don&#x27;t seem  extremely  sturdy, but I will use them minimally. It fits in my Vera Bradley perfectly, so I know it will work well in most of my other purses also. I&#x27;m looking forward to finding items easier and being able to keep my purse organized.</li>
    <li> The bag is handy, but just slightly large for my purse.  It has lots of pockets and storage. Smelled a little plastic when I first got it, but it might have just been the packaging.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised about the quality and how big this bag is. It fits in my purses and still leaves the pockets in the purse available. There are so many different slots to keep things in, so you can find everything. I saw a similar one at Ross and it was the &amp;#34;as advertised on TV&amp;#34; one and it was much smaller and poorly made.I ordered one of each of my three daughters an hope they find it as useful as I do.</li>
    <li> I have the small 31 purse, and this organizer fits perfectly. It allows to me quickly move between my 31 purses without digging though a bunch of stuff. The two zippered pouches on the side are great for concealing small items you don&#x27;t want the whole world seeing, and all the little outside pockets are great for not losing your chapstick or travel bottle of aspirin.</li>
    <li> The product was cheap, and made of cheap materials.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it not too long ago and it has already ripped.</li>
    <li> Easily moveable from one bag to another. Nice size. Could only be better if it had a light in it.</li>
    <li> Fits great in purse, has plenty of room. Easier to find products. Could not be happier w/product. Met my expectations. The price was right, give it 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I didnt expect much as I only paid a couple dollars for this, but its cheaply made, one of the zippers wont close but half way. It will do for what I bought it for, (coupons) but was hoping for a little more It was bigger then I expected tho, so thats a bonus.</li>
    <li> I am quite pleased with this organizer, especially considering the price. I ordered one for my sister as a gift, and when my mom saw them, she wanted one too. They are a nice size for bigger-than-small purses and surpassed my expectations for quality. I like that the outside pockets are padded, and the zipped pockets are nice and spacious. I want to order more because I like them and think they are a bargain, but I&#x27;ll have to think of where else I could use an organizer. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> The pouch had really helped me organize my stuff in my bag! It has many different compartments to keep several items and it makes it very convenient to retrieve the items in a jiffy. Really loved it!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to zip this product shut since opening it.  They have to be the cheapest zippers I have ever seen. I like the idea of the product but the quality is not good. The first time I tried to zip it the zipper &amp;#34;tag&amp;#34; fell off. I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this organizer. The one I received is a little different from the one in the photograph (the grey material looks more brown, and is darker than in the picture) but since it&#x27;s going inside my handbag anyway, I don&#x27;t really care. The photographs don&#x27;t make this clear, but it has another set of mesh and padded pockets on the other side of the bag that isn&#x27;t pictured. Unlike the side shown, however, that has the two mesh pockets divided again into four narrower pockets, the other side just has two wide mesh pockets as well as the padded pockets on the other side of the bag. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the zippers as some reviewers have mentioned, though they don&#x27;t feel that sturdy. I would be careful zipping and unzipping them. I carry a medium-sized rectangular handbag, and this organizer fits well inside of it. It has just enough padding to fill out the bag nicely, helping it keep its shape.</li>
    <li> The picture doesn&#x27;t do this thing justice.  It is REALLY ugly.  There are many, many other colors of the same item on Amazon.  So pick a color you like.  I was just didn&#x27;t want to spend any more money on it and this was the cheapest one.  It is very useful, though.  It does help a lot to keep everything organized.  But what I like the most is that it has handles and you can take almost everything out of your purse so easily if you want to change purses or if you&#x27;re still having trouble finding things.  The one I have is pretty sturdy as far as construction goes.  If I had it to do over again, though, I&#x27;d pick a different color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  After just a few months, my pouch completely fell apart.  The material is really cheap and the stitching is not very good I guess.</li>
    <li> This is fabulous! I am extremely happy with it. I have several hobo purses that I love how they look, but hate how you can&#x27;t find anything in them. This item makes my purses new again. I love them even more now. There are enough pockets for even me! I need pockets for everything. I carry about 10 lipsticks/balms at all times in my purse with my wipes and hand lotion. Not to mention my phone, ipod, and credit cards, receipts, and bronzer. Even my sunglasses all fit nicely in here. All organized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item is made from a plastic material that reminds me of a lined jacket. There are also mesh pockets on the outside. I counted 13 pockets. Four small mesh on one side, two bigger mesh on the other. Two solid pockets each side. You also have two big pockets on each side with zippers. And the big one in the middle that is uncovered. There are also two loops on top to pull this bag out of your purse easily. Mine is gray with yellow trim. Not that anyone can actually see the colors. So, I can change purses in a flash any time with ease. I also received this quicker than I thought. Great buy!</li>
    <li> very good organizing bag to put into a large tote. however the material is not the expensive type, but I am still happy given the price is so cheap.</li>
    <li> i love that it fits in my big purse that doesn&#x27;t have enough pockets, so this pouch is great to put everything in there and be organized . The quality is ok so far it still works and it didn&#x27;t break in the zipper area like some people here have complained about but i guess its how careless or how ruff you are with it but overall i love it because it has space for everything including my big phone and plus you cant beat the price and it looks nice, and if i had to i can transition everything from one purse to another in less than 2 minutes. if i had to gift it to someone i would, it makes having a purse easier and organized</li>
    <li> This organizer is smaller than what I thought, but because of the low price, I gave it 4 starts.  Since it is shipped from China, the shipment is so low, it took almost half a month.</li>
    <li> right size for medium to large size purse or tote. Very functional</li>
    <li> Received my purse bags yesterday. Love them but now I need another bigger one.</li>
    <li> This so handy dandy!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It was smaller than I expected.  My purses are a pretty generous size.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price !!</li>
    <li> Bought this quite some time ago and still use it daily in my bag I carry to and from work. Without it the bottom of my bag would be a jumble of crap. This keeps the crap at least somewhat organized and easier to find.</li>
    <li> This pouch bag is great for organizing your items in your handbag. I no longer have to search deep in my handbag to find my keys. Who wouldn&#x27;t want this product for the price and convenience!! Marci</li>
    <li> AWESOME!! I love this handbag organizer, I have used many much more expensive but this one is just perfect with all the zipper compartments and pockets anyone could need. Just the right size for my handbag. Love it.</li>
    <li> This bag is great.  I use this as a tool bag for my tech tools. There are multiple pockets for lots of things: open pockets, mesh pockets, and zippered compartments. There are also snaps on the sides to adjust the bag for a larger/smaller fit. I could see this bag working for any number of jobs: small tools, pet care items, kids&#x27; toys, travel items for your car/truck. The bag is really great and the possibilities are endless. It should be noted that this bag does not have a hard bottom or reinforced sides. It is soft, pliable, light weight, washable, and durable. The only thing that could be improved upon would be larger handles. The small handles that are on the bag work, but if you were transporting it with other items in your hand, a larger set of handles would allow for you to slide it over your wrist or arm to help you carry multiple things. Other than that, this bag is great.</li>
    <li> It is good quality,  very light weight (so good for travel) with many compartments.  I use it for my make up travel bag instead of hand bag organizer.  It sits nicely on any small hotel vanity.  It also has handles, so you can hang it in the bathroom if needed. Nice neutral grey color with some yellow stripe to break the monotony.  Zippered compartments secured stuff nicely.  Several see-through mesh pouches make it easy to find stuff.  It was sent from Hong Kong.  It arrived much earlier than what they promised. The price is so reasonable.</li>
    <li> It holds so many things and keeps me from having to dig everything out of the bottom of the &#x27;bottomless pit&#x27; that I call my purse! I only wish it came in other colors, yellow and grey together are not really my favorite. Other than that, no complaints!</li>
    <li> I bought this pouch three months ago and it has been much nicer than I expected. While not the prettiest thing in the world, it has a pocket for everything, and makes switching between my larger purses very easy. I don&#x27;t care how my purse looks on the inside, as long as I can find everything that I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pouch is a very good value, and really helped make my tote style purses more manageable. I don&#x27;t miss phone calls just because I can&#x27;t find my phone. My lotion is here, my lipstick is there, my powder is right there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material appears to be very durable. I don&#x27;t expect the pouch to break anytime soon, but if I had to replace it for any reason, I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Just as one would hope an organizer would be. It is durable and makes switching purses a breeze.  It fits really well in different sized bags.  Also, it has zippered compartments which are especially helpful in bags that don&#x27;t zip or snap or otherwise close on their own.</li>
    <li> Item arrived weeks ahead of estimated arrival time. Was in great condition. The colors aren&#x27;t what I would have liked if I could have picked them, but that is why I got it for less than $5 with no S&amp;H charge. It is a nice large size with LOTS of compartments (I even missed one of the zippered ones when I initially filled it. I highly recommended it for women who switch purses frequently or who are tired of having to dump out their whole purse to find something in it!  *Please note that a few months after I posted this, this item tore in several places.</li>
    <li> The product I received looks exactly like the picture. It&#x27;s cheaply put together and made with cheap components but it&#x27;s better than I expected considering the price. It will come in handy for my knitting notions.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of it and for traveling it will be good.  Maybe as a make up bag.  Otherwise I found it to big and bulky for my purses and it make things harder to find?</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as depicted in photo. Good size, sturdy construction, and very good quality considering the price - much better than expected.</li>
    <li> It is ok but, the binding was not stitch on properly at the bottom of the bag. The raw edge is showing</li>
    <li> Ordered this for a Hobo type bag. It fit perfectly inside. Has many compartments to hold all of your stuff. We have 5 boys and it has space for diapers, wipes, a small first aid kit, snacks, my wallet, keys, medications, make up etc. Only problem is that there are so many compartments that once inside a bag some items are hard to find or get to. Not sure if it is just the style of bag I had it in that made this a problem. Over all I liked the organizer and you really cant go wrong for the price. Would have been nice when our boys were younger for a diaper bag,</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed and expected. I am very satisfied. Would recommend. Also, it arrived exactly when I was told it would, maybe a bit sooner.</li>
    <li> So this is amazing and I LOVE it. I was skeptical about the price and such, but when it arrived it has revolutionized the way I organize my bag. Everything just used to float around in it like a washing machine, constantly getting mixed in and I could never find anything. This organizer is amazing, cheap, and well-built. I LOVE it - I can&#x27;t reiterate how much I&#x27;m kicking myself for not getting one sooner.</li>
    <li> Great organiser for my new purse.  I am looking forward to using it when my new purse is received for 31.</li>
    <li> I love that it has a lot of pockets.  However would have liked a closure on the center divider pocket.  2 of the 3 larger spaces have zippers, but one has nothing, and it actually holds the most.  This can also be said for the smaller side pockets as well.  It organizes as it states, but it has the potential to not travel well as items may fall out of unsecured pockets.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife so she can carry diapers and cream for our toddler in her purse. She absolutely loved this since she was able to stuff it all into this organizer and can take it out and put it in another purse easily. It is also great because it can expand, in case you need to put in extra items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a heads up to people who have thin purses, if you expand it, you might not be able to fit it in your purse.</li>
    <li> At this price, I was not expecting this bag to be so well made! Really adorable and perfect for a Disney vacation.</li>
    <li> Perfect to have in my weekend bag. Not too big, not too small</li>
    <li> Purchased for my mother.  It&#x27;s very nice and perfect for he active lifestyle.  She changes purses often for going out, going to her Red Hat activities, and back to casual, everyday purses.  It has pockets and it&#x27;s mess so you can see everything.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> Terrific, well made product with a very low price. I was pleasantly surprised when the pouch arrived faster than expected and found it was so well made. I honestly didn&#x27;t expect it to be much of anything for the price. All of the seams are well finished, the zippers sturdy and firmly in place and the multiple pouches convenient. I expected a dollar store kind of product and instead received a product that would sell for $30 in an Airline magazine.</li>
    <li> I bought two,cheap plastic  zippers don&#x27;t work well and they are really not very classy.</li>
    <li> This is a welcome accessory for mid-large handbags with little or no inside pockets (i.e. Longchamp).  There are two zippered compartments, 2 large outside pockets/2 large outside mesh pockets on one side, and 2 large pockets/4 smaller mesh pockets on the other side.  The space in the middle can be used to store larger items (iPad fits perfect with some room to spare).  The handles of the organizer make it easy and convenient to switch bags.  There was an initial smell upon opening this item, but that has since dissipated.</li>
    <li> There was a smell, as others have mentioned, and with my allergies upon opening it went straight to the garage to air out. After a bit of time, it was much better. Just sprayed a little perfume onto it and have had no problems with smell coming back-and if I don&#x27;t, I doubt anyone would! It is big enough that I use the middle and side pockets, which are very nice, and use the zippered pockets kind of like a secret pocket for things I want to stash away or not lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good value for your money. Do wish the colors were different, but for this price I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, especially considering the price.  It is sturdy, well made, and has more pockets that I will ever need.  It also sits squarely at the bottom of a purse, so there is no rolling over and everything is easy to find.  I plan on ordering more as Christmas gifts.  This is the best organizer I have seen, and the least expensive.</li>
    <li> When I saw this product online, I knew I needed something like this forever. The frustration of jumbled stuff even when I put them in different pockets, still the three million ladies stuff needed something beyond that. I ordered these for myself and my 2 sisters and all  of us are in love with it. The product is very nice and smooth with handful of pockets. It has made my life so much easy. Shopping is a bliss now!</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift and the recipient keeps thanking me.  We are backpack users at work, but then need to go somewhere during the day with a purse.  I was the recipient pull this out and use it as a purse.  We&#x27;re also finally glad to have something to organize the big purses with little or no organization inside.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like, I love it! It&#x27;s great buy for the price and free shipping (OMG).  It has excellent quality; great color contrast, adequate number of compartments for different accessories.  It goes very well with my new Longchamp Le Pilage tote.</li>
    <li> It is bigger than I thought, and only fits in big totes.  But I think is ok for travelling or vacations.</li>
    <li> When I first got it I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this bag. Everything is well stitched and the zippers work well. The mesh pockets are in good condition after several months&#x27; use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bag is small enough to fit in most of my handbags, and yet big enough to hold everything I need. I carry a lot of knickknacks wherever I go, this bag allows me to get organized AND switch handbags without having to transfer everything from one to the other. I would highly recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> Added the organization my book bag was lacking. Finally got sick of digging through my pocketless bag to find everything and now have extra time to find what I&#x27;m looking for in my disorganized office.</li>
    <li> I actually like this item but when I opened the package and looked at the organizer I noticed that the stitching between the compartments was pulled loose so that kinda of upset me. It is almost like one compartment on the one side, no stitching between completely to separate. That was the only thing wrong!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Liz hofer</li>
    <li> I use this daily. I TRY to match my purses to my clothes, so this makes mornings a LOT easier when switching out.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t pay much for this, so that&#x27;s good.  Overall it&#x27;s very handy and has worked exactly how I had hoped it would.  Two not so good things: there are two loops on each side of the middle pocket making it easy to grab the pouch out of your handbag. Within a couple weeks one of the loops broke. The other is the industrial color (grey and yellow, just as pictured) -- not aesthetically pleasing.  However, the number of pockets and overall design works really, really well.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this product.  The zippers are very difficult to open and shut.  They keep catching every few centimeters.  Bag too tall for my purse.  Wish I had not purchased it.</li>
    <li> I use this to organize my makeup. It works very well, it stands up on its own, and the pockets are good size. I like how it has two zippers, as well, and it has many &amp;#34;compartments&amp;#34; to hold similar items in one location to make them easy to locate.</li>
    <li> This pouch is very convenient and I wish I would have bought more for my friends and family!  Keeps everything nice and organized!</li>
    <li> I filled this full of useful things like hand sanitizer, lint roller, gum, dog leash, paper, pens, floss and much more! Everything is now organized in my center console! Great buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slow delivery, but for $4 I wan&#x27;t going to complain!</li>
    <li> Its damn useful to keep things arranged in my messenger bag. Its cheap, the quality is OK, and seems to be value for money (time will tell) but its really helpful - I keep my headphone cable, iPhone, iPhone charging cable, MiFi, Keys, Metro cards, Visiting cards, Small notepad, Regular pen, wallet, bills, and more - everything is organized well. I am ordering another for my spouse and sister.</li>
    <li> What a great, inexpensive idea on ow to quickly organize the bottom of your purse!  I put things away and they stay organized.  No more digging through all of my junk!  Arrived quickly too</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright I guess but not what I expected. It&#x27;s very small and has tones of packets that make me a little crazy and feels like at this point I&#x27;m lost in my own bag. Perhaps might work for someone else but not for me. I don&#x27;t poke varying diaper bags so thought I could transform my coach bag in one but this is way too small.</li>
    <li> LOve love this bag organiser perfect size for all my handbags,it is even a little on the small size for one of my handbag[i love big handbags]</li>
    <li> this item has helped me keep my purse in tip-top order! I can find the contents of my purse now with no problems!  I love it!</li>
    <li> Great deal!!! My girlfriend has another brand that she spent A LOT more money on and mine is way better!!</li>
    <li> I love this organizer! It&#x27;s brought sanity to my purse. Before it would take me forever to find what I needed. Now, everything has its place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do need a good size purse otherwise it won&#x27;t fit. It&#x27;s strictly made for us gals who like their large pocketbooks.</li>
    <li> I tend to carry large purses or tote bags, so normally everything ends up on the bottom of the bag and your left digging for what you need. I no longer have to dig around for my wallet or keys or anything else for that matter. There are enough pockets and dividers and this pouch to keep everything organized. The zippers are made from plastic but seem to be holding up fine. I like it so much that I ordered another one in a different color for my personal care products when I travel. I figure it will fit in my suitcase just as easy as my purse.</li>
    <li> You can use it in larger purses. You can also take it out and put it in anouther purse. Its ok</li>
    <li> Filled it up and put it into my purse as soon as it arrived which was rather quickly I might add.  It&#x27;s easy to retrieve everything I&#x27;ve put in it.  Haven&#x27;t switched purses but when I do it will be very easy to do so since all I&#x27;ll have to do is pull it out of where it is and place it into the new one.  Ideal!</li>
    <li> Fantastic idea and made well. Fits in most of my bags and makes grabbing what you need so much quicker. I am currently using in a large MK bag that was basicly a sackful of chaos. Now I&#x27;m not digging for my wallet, that hair tie or keys that are never on the top of the pile. Would also work well as a toiltetry bag.</li>
    <li> I originally got this because I had to fly somewhere and I have a bunch of items that I like to carry with me during my trips. I have my charging cord for my iPad, my iPad itself, passports, my son&#x27;s charging cord for his DS and many other things. This made my organization so much more better that I just slid it into my backpack and it fit perfect and I was able to access everything very easily.</li>
    <li> I keep all my shipping supplies, stamps, scissosrs, tape, etc in this little bag.  It fits inside my purse,but is a usable size</li>
    <li> I finally got to use this on my overseas trip a few weeks ago and already there is a tear along the inside lining seam along the bottom of the bag.  I can still use it as the tear does not go all the way to the outer layer since there are other sections and pockets which add to the number of layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, using this bag as a travel amenity bag was convenient.  I put all my travel sized shampoo, conditioner, body soap, face soap, tooth brush and paste, deodorant and hair care products.  The bag has an extender snap button one the sides so you can expand it to hold more items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing that I noticed was since there is no way to close the top of the main middle section, my bottles kept falling out in my suitcase as I was using it to hold toiletries.  But if you were using it as a handbag pouch organizer, I guess you&#x27;d want the main portion open for easy access?  I guess it depends what you want to use it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, good size bag but you get what you pay for quality-wise.  At this price, I&#x27;m not surprised nor too upset that it only lasted 2 weeks during my one travel.</li>
    <li> I really like that I can pick this out of one bag and transfer most everything to a different purse.  The side pockets work really for checkbooks.</li>
    <li> Not as functional as it looks, doesn&#x27;t unfold well and isn&#x27;t sturdy enough to hold its shape once inside a purse or bag.</li>
    <li> the inside on one side ripped so i only used breifly  for about a  week. wouldnt buy another one of same material</li>
    <li> I bought this organizer for my daughter who has a LV Speedy 35 bag. Everything was always jumbled inside but if you have an LV bag you now you are not going to use something else. This organizer fits her bag perfectly and holds all her &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; in easy-to-find pockets. It is very well made even though it is so inexpensive. I recommend this organizer.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t as wide as it looks in the picture. But, it tamed my bag and did a good job if organizing everything.</li>
    <li> This looked like a great purchase but the entire side ripped open within the first week that I had it. If it would stay together, I think it would be really good. I like the size and the compartments/pockets but you get what you pay for with this one.</li>
    <li> Fantastic !!!!  I pick this out put in next purse ready to go. !!!! I change my purse at least 5 time a wk</li>
    <li> I bought one of these for myself and one for my mom.  They are wonderful!</li>
    <li> It holds a ton of stuff, however it will stand upright in my purse, my purse does have a great deal of structure...I was hoping this would, but it has not.  Overall I like it however I need to use it in different purses or just stop carrying so much junk in my bag!!!</li>
    <li> I have a purse with a single large pocket and was constantly &amp;#34;losing&amp;#34; things in it. This organizer helped to stop that nerve wrecking trend.</li>
    <li> It really was more of a detriment than it was a help. Didnt fit the purse well and was so many pockets to search for stuff.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t complain too much because of the price, but I do feel like the thickness (or padding) of the item makes my purse kind of full and busy because it&#x27;s not stiff.</li>
    <li> The product is okay but the main reason I dislike it and don&#x27;t use it is because it is too large to be practical. It does not fit easily into normal sized handbags.</li>
    <li> The zipper sticks when I try to open and close it. I would not buy it again.I want something easy to use.</li>
    <li> It works great in most of my bags don&#x27;t have to take up time to change purses anymore.  Time saving!  Great seller.</li>
    <li> This thing is FANTASTIC!! Very happy witg the purchase. Would advise it for any woman looking to get from under the vortex that tends to collect in our bags.</li>
    <li> The sides on this organizer are not rigid as the picture might imply, making it sag in the purse and difficult to use. The handles really should tuck in somewhere because the items get hung up going in and out of the main pocket.  the soft construction makes it difficult to find anything in the slots and pockets.</li>
    <li> The bag organizer is very nice and is as shown in the picture.  Very happy with the purchase.  Good buy...</li>
    <li> product was exactly as described. works great in a larger purse or tote. does take forever to arrive but came during estimated time frame.</li>
    <li> It does keep things organized in my purse, but it&#x27;s not super-sturdy; one side of it started to rip out in a very short amount of time. I still use it anyway!</li>
    <li> I love this bag organizer! I change purses all the time and this makes it so easy for me. I use it all the time and I would definitely buy more to give as gifts!</li>
    <li> Nice product, doesn&#x27;t fit well in alot of purses but it worked great for the one I got it for.</li>
    <li> Perfect for fast purse changes</li>
    <li> The bag organizer works very well in my tote bag.&lt;br /&gt;The many pockets are just what I needed to keep everything from laying in the bottom of my bag</li>
    <li> While I typically by-pass handbags that do not have several internal pockets, I couldn&#x27;t pass up one that was just too cute. So, I got this at a steal. Have only used it for about 3 weeks, but so far, so good.</li>
    <li> The material is soft and slightly padded. The zippers work and the compartments are just the right size. The only thing that was wrong with mine is the snaps on the side, which are supposed to allow you to snap the bag into a narrower width, are mismatched so I can&#x27;t actually snap them to one another. It doesn&#x27;t bother me, though.</li>
    <li> very poor quality - received it with the inside pockets already coming undone and ripped. if you&#x27;re looking for something durable that will last you a good while, look somewhere else. if this is for something that you don&#x27;t care about or will keep stashed away maybe in the car, it might be okay. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it either way.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s useful but the mesh is flimsy. Mine is torn.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very particular about my purses. In steed of using this I just have my purses made to suit me or buy one with many pockets</li>
    <li> JUST WHAT I NEEDED IN MY BAG,VERY USEFUL FOR ORGANIZING AND FINDING THE ITEMS I NEED AND KEEPING MY BAG ORGANIZED!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this insert.  It is currently in use in my coach bag.  There are so many pockets I don&#x27;t even know how to fill all of them.  If you like to be organized, like I do, get this for your purse.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t fit or work in any of my purses or bags. Disappointed. It&#x27;s just too long to make it work.</li>
    <li> just as described very useful to find everything in my purse. Now everything isnt all jumbled up and I can find what I need quickly.</li>
    <li> I like the organizer, but you have to make sure you do not unzip the zippers all the way because the pull will come off.</li>
    <li> Excellent and Sturdy! The pockets are big and sturdy.  The handles, great.  I really like it and I expect it to last a while.</li>
    <li> I ordered one for myself and I love it! I had to order two more for my sisters because they wanted mine! This is for bigger size purses not little ones. Lots of pockets to keep everything organized, two pockets have zippers.</li>
    <li> I got this super cheap and it didn&#x27;t disappoint. It has a TON of pockets...almost too many, hah! But seriously, it&#x27;s great for transferring items from bag to bag.</li>
    <li> I chose this organizer because it had all the necessary compartments I was looking for...and, the price was right!  I was more than satisfied when I received it! It is made extremely well and looks like an expensive organizer.  Would definitely recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Best concept ever, no more hunting around my handbag for keys etc.just lift and go to change bag, saves so much time when you are rushing.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is keeping my purse organized. I can also change it from purse to purse, an option I didn&#x27;t realize until I needed to switch purses one day quickly.</li>
    <li> We ordered several and use them for just about everything! They are great to use in a larger purse, suitcase, or to organize your items in a drawer! We use them for crafts, makeup, hair accessories, and many other things!</li>
    <li> I used the product very rarely, may be about total 25 day in last 6 months.  Although I liked being organized but the quality is very poor and the seams ripped of from one end completely and its not usable anymore&lt;br /&gt;Next time i will spend more and buy a better quality item&lt;br /&gt;And I did not handle it rough AT ALL</li>
    <li> Handy and helpful- bought one for me and my friend. May not be beautiful but is functional and really helps when you want to change your purse quickly</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great roomy and the right size pockets and really great price.I love this Organiser i recommend it very highly.</li>
    <li> This has so many pockets and places to stash you stuff.  There are 2 zipper compartments, one on each side, 2 solid pockets on each side, and where the mesh goes around the outside there are even more pockets. Plus a loop on each side at the center compartment in which to take the pouch out of your purse.  This pouch will keep the shape of your purse, in case your handbag is made of a soft leather or fabric.</li>
    <li> Very hard to stuff things in because it is too soft. Why can&#x27;t them make something simpler but more stiff?</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this SODIAL- Handbag Pouch Bag in Bag Organizer insert!!!  I put all my stuff in it and it fit perfectly in my Coach tote style handbag!!  I can see everything.  I may just order another one!!</li>
    <li> Surprised to find how practical this item is.  Using for keeping items organized on my loveseat, TV remotes, Water bottle, pen, note paper, etc.  Also could be great for handbags, too, Particularly like the loop handles on the inside of both length-side tops.  Makes it easy to lift out.  Or to hang from a hook in any location.  And good number of organizing pockets.  Great value buy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this organizer as a gift.  It took a while to receive, but was worth the wait.  Now I want one for myself.  This would be great for any number of organizing tasks. Crafts, makeup, kids art tools, etc. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> great size and it is lightweight so it is perfect for what i need to switch between bags.  thank you</li>
    <li> Just as picture shows. Will be getting another for my sister. I got it in 3 weeks (ships from Hong Kong and delivered to Florida). But hello for the price, I&#x27;ll wait it out. Has several pockets. Fits perfect in my LV Neverfull MM as well as other medium size purses. Puffy type nylon but it goes inside purse anyways! and if not it&#x27;s also great for travel, stuff with travel items and pop into luggage. Either way, great organizer!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. The quality of the product is great. It fits in my purse beautifully. I would also recommend this product if you use a tote to carry your things instead of a purse like one of my daughters does. I ordered a second one.</li>
    <li> product is accurately shown in the picture. great quality for the price. came in two weeks.great great great great great</li>
    <li> I bought a large hobo bag that I love but could not find anything in it. This organizer is a great buy!</li>
    <li> I have not travelled with it yet,but I know it&#x27;s going to be great.  Lots of compartments.  Can&#x27;t wait to use it in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Never again will I fret over changing out my purse to coordinate with my outfit! This purse organizer houses all of my must-haves as well as whatever else I need to bring along. The zipper pockets are perfect for storing reciepts or cosmetics, and the numerous pouches are roomy. Finally, I can change purses without unloading and reloading everything! This organizer is perfect!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my new handbag organizer.  It was very inexpensive and I love all the compartments.  I was able to put all the stuff in my purse into this handy little organizer.</li>
    <li> This organizer is one of my favorites now. It holds a lot and has straps for those &#x27;quick on the go, but don&#x27;t want to take my whole bag too&#x27; times.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, it was offered at the Add-On price. Can&#x27;t beat a great deal!</li>
    <li> Great product! I love it it is bigger than what I image. great value, great quality. Use it many places</li>
    <li> I love this it has so many pockets and places to store stuff to keep your bag organised which gives me the freedom to  buy any bag I like. I hate open pouch purses because everything gets in a heap but with this my bag is wonderfully organized.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say yea or nay since I have not yet received this item - Check back later - I quess it will be here someday</li>
    <li> Too light weight and good colors and enought pocket and zipper .&lt;br /&gt;Very comfort inner bag!&lt;br /&gt;I just move this bag (my bag to bag)&lt;br /&gt;Easy going^^</li>
    <li> The handbag pouch bag in bag organizer insert organizer tidy bag is wonderful.  It&#x27;s exactly as described.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This is a nice organizer, it is bigger than I expected, but I like all the pockets. I will use it in a bigger tote bag that I have.</li>
    <li> Holds all my purse items.&lt;br /&gt;Nice to transfer from one purse to another.&lt;br /&gt;So nice to be able to find purse items so quickly, rather than hunting and hunting for them.&lt;br /&gt;Saves me time!</li>
    <li> its great. i can put it in the twins diaper bag. now i dont have to carry my purse and the diaper bags too.  it has enough compartments for cash checkbook, make up, and small date book or calender.</li>
    <li> This item was much nicer than I expected, especially for the price.  Great for tote or baby bags and larger purses.  Plenty of slightly padded pockets to get organized and is light weight so it doesn&#x27;t make my bag any heavier.  Well worth the wait; it is shipped from Hong Kong so takes longer to arrive. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this, especially under $5 shipped.</li>
    <li> Do you have only one purse? That&#x27;s no problem. Buy this. It has pockets galore to organize your crap and keep it cozy and safe. Do you travel? Buy this. Pull it out of your one bag and stuff it into your one carry-on. The best use is switching out purses, but this is so much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lightweight and cheap as DIRT. Some had issues with quality but mine is sturdy and awesome. I LOVE IT. BUY ONE. The only down side was how long I had to wait for it but that was forgotten when I organized all my crap into it and stuffed it into my purse that used to be top heavy and too thin. Now the purse has more of a base and I have pockets galore. BUY IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh wait, no. Don&#x27;t buy it. I might need another someday. And everyone I know is getting one for a gift. Diaper bag? Organize it. Gym bag? Organize your toiletries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sound like it but I have NO affiliation with the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> The product advertised was exactly what I wanted, I ordered two and plan to order some more for myself, my daughter and as gifts  for friends and family. The extra sides hold much more things than I had expected and when not needed the extra storage space on both sides can be snapped closed to so that the openings can be secured and not flop open.</li>
    <li> This is perfect it keeps my large handbag organized and I can locate everything I need ,if I want to change purses all I have to do is pull that out and I have everything I need</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I expected and it can fit into almost any size purse because I have a smaller slim purse and it worked well in there too. I am always losing things and having to dig to the bottom of my purse, but this helped me keep things in place. I really like the handles in the middle that can let me easily pull the whole insert out of my purse!</li>
    <li> it is ok i still have a had time finding things because it is hard so see on the sides but is helpful for not everything going to the bottom of my bag.</li>
    <li> This item is not very well made and the materials/padding sounds crunchy.  Has a very cheap feel to it.  Would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am glad I purchased this organizer because it works great, is strong and was not expensive, I would purchase it again too.</li>
    <li> The organizer itself is okay, but it&#x27;s just too big for my purse! My purse is a pretty massive, but the organizer sticks out of the top. Maybe if they used a different color other than yellow, it wouldn&#x27;t be that noticeable. It serves its purpose and has lots of different pouches - I will probably leave it in my tote bag and use it for vacations.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a purse but I use it for my messenger bag and it&#x27;s awesome.  It keeps all my things organized and I love that it&#x27;s padded, I can put my tablet in one of the pockets and know that it&#x27;s safe.  Awesome product highly recommended.</li>
    <li> A bit more flimsy than I expected, and not useful for what I purchased it for, but it is ok in the end</li>
    <li> Just got my bag yesterday.  I have it all loaded and ready to go. Love the space.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect for such a low price, but I love this handy pouch!! It keeps everything organized and it&#x27;s so easy to change purses now!!</li>
    <li> Perfect to keep everything on hand when changing from purse to purse in seconds with no worries about forgetting something.</li>
    <li> What I expected. .strong and durable</li>
    <li> this is really handy  i use it  very offen</li>
    <li> Trew in trash along with the other 2 I bought. Poorly made, if you want a good quality item buy a Pursfection.</li>
    <li> it was exactly what i was looking for... i guess this is the knock off item because one of the handle broke or tore off first week.  I guess what you pay for is what you get.  but nonetheless it is a great item with the many pockets it keeps my purse organize.</li>
    <li> Zippers on both side of bag get stuck half way, very frustrating! Would not buy it again because of this.</li>
    <li> I first saw this purse organizer on Groupon selling for $15 however I missed the deal.  Then, I found it here on Amazon for $4.00 and free shipping and I ordered right away.  The organizer is great and makes switching bags so much easier.  Fits my kindle e-reader, notebook, chargers, glasses and a ton of other.  Wish I would have ordered several more for friends and family!</li>
    <li> When the bag arrived, one of carry handle was rip off, and was made from very cheap material. I was looking forward to this but sadly not good product. But fast shipment.</li>
    <li> I love this item.  It is roomy with lots of pockets and a big zipper center.  So easy to lift and take to another bag or tote from your purse.  well constructed.</li>
    <li> Material isn&#x27;t great, but will work fine. This is why there are 4 stars. Many pockets make it nice for separation of items.</li>
    <li> I only give it 3 stars because some of the zippered areas dont work.It is good place to put my cell phone.</li>
    <li> It is good enough at $5! Dual zippers get stuck, but it is still functional and keeps my items separated.</li>
    <li> I stumbled upon these while cruising Amazon one day and I bought 6 of them.  I kept one and gave away 5 as gifts.  I have since bought many, many more ...  I will tell you why .... these are PERFECT little organizers for both men and women!  Not only are they very lightweight, but they are nicely made and designed!  You can use them inside-out to put the pockets on the inside or outside.  Some pockets are mesh and see-thru, others are completely enclosed.  There are two zippered pouches in addition to all the pockets and it has small, unobtrusive webbed handles for easy pick-up out of purses and drawers.  It also has snaps on the side to keep it narrow and skinny or unsnapped for its full filling potential.  It is made of a  slightly padded,  slippery, rayon-nylon material which can be easily washed and quickly dried - like the material windbreakers are made of - BUT these are NOT flimsy!  I originally bought one for my purse ... but I now have one in my briefcase for holding my electronic gizmos:  the power cords, the flash drives, the stylus&#x27;s, earbuds, mini-mouses,  etc.  I have one in my desk drawer with pens, sharpies, tape, etc.  that I can pull out when I am working at my desk or take with me when I move to other areas to complete projects.  I have one in my car console with coin change and a few dollar bills, writing pens, small writing pad,  cell phone charger,  small pack of wipes,  small pack of Kleenex,  aspirin, chapstick, gum and breath mints, small flashlight,  etc.  All those things that might be loose in your glove box, or rolling around in the console box,  all neatly contained in this organizer.  The slightly padded middle is large enough for my GPS so I can slip it inside and easily stash the whole thing under the seat before leaving my car.  These come in a variety of colors so you can order some in muted colors (I have the gray)  for briefcases and office drawers.  I have brightly colored ones for my purse and car.  I have given these away as gifts to both my guy and girl friends and relatives.  EVERYONE loves them and asks me where they can buy them so they can buy more.  Perfect size, plenty of large and small pockets and zippered compartments.  PERFECT.ifts to both my guy and girl friends and relatives.  EVERYONE loves them and asks me where they can buy them so they can buy more.  Perfect size, plenty of large and small pockets and zippered compartments.  PERFECT.</li>
    <li> It even comes with little handles for easy liftout to ease into another bag - perfect! Holds everything! Ordering several more for my girls and for friends who are always searching through all of the stuff in their bags! AND it is put together very well. You cannot beat the price!</li>
    <li> The pouch is much wider than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;It will fit in my larger purses but not in my smaller purses.&lt;br /&gt;Lots of slots and pockets.</li>
    <li> Throw it in totes or drawstring bags for organization! I really like how it is padded for protection for my camera or phone. So many pockets everywhere.</li>
    <li> This organizer looks just like the picture, so in that respect there were no unpleasant surprises.  It shipped from China, so it took a long time to arrive.  My biggest complaint is that the zippers are very low quality and are difficult to close and open, they also get stuck frequently.</li>
    <li> There are so many pockets, and have something to put in just about all of them. The item is reversible and it is easy to pull it out of one purse and placing it in another. The zippers are a little sticky, however I am not sure if it is the construction of the item or my propensity to overstuff it. This item is great for the big bag purses that are in style, those purses rarely have any organizational pockets inside. You need this! You want this...do not try and fight it.</li>
    <li> Great Service and Great product. It has plenty of space and packs everything very neatly.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered two bags one came with a broken zipper and both of them the zippers are very tight to use. I am not impressed with the quality. It also took close to a month to be delivered not worth exchanging. Would not buy from them again.</li>
    <li> It falls over, doesn&#x27;t hold items as shown as neatly, because when it goes in ur purse u have trouble digging each item back out of it..if they haven&#x27;t fallen out already...</li>
    <li> Love it! It keeps my bag more organized, just like it&#x27;s designed to do.</li>
    <li> so good organizer ... makes me feel amazing about my bag :D</li>
    <li> Fine quality purse insert.</li>
    <li> If you have a giant purse that you just shove things in to this is perfect for you. Definitely not for those with tiny purses.</li>
    <li> A must for any large purse/ tote-type handbag.&lt;br /&gt;A place/compartment for any- and everything you NEED to carry in your handbag.&lt;br /&gt;The price can&#x27;t be beat -- have seen similar items for 3x the price paid on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t stand having to dig around the bottom of my purse for an item.&lt;br /&gt;a couple of the compartments have a privacy zipper -- great for storing your wallet.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great at keeping items in your bag organized. Great for bags that don&#x27;t have sections or pockets. Can be used with multiple bags.</li>
    <li> organization is essential when you&#x27;re a professional on the go. this allows my purse to be as organized as my schedule.</li>
    <li> I bought this organizer for my Filofax goodies and pens, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the construction and the amount of items it can hold.  It really is packed with pens, stickers, post-it notes, clips and a variety of other items and it is holding up very well.  There are multiple pockets and areas so you can organize your items and keep them from getting all mixed up with one another.  I am sure it would work well as an organizer for handbags, eliminating the need to transfer your items from one purse to another, allowing you to just move the entire things and keeping all your things right where you are used to finding them.  For the price I doubt you will find anything better.</li>
    <li> This bag is perfect to keep all of my things organized in my oversized purse. The bag is bigger than I expected and just what I needed! Lots of pockets, zippers and compartments. Now I don&#x27;t have makeup falling apart all over the inside of my shoulder bag.I would buy another if I needed it!</li>
    <li> sure makes changing purses easier, but shipping takes a long time.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I imagined, but suits it&#x27;s purpose. Has lots of little pockets for your items. Keeps you purse more organized and neat.</li>
    <li> I recently bought a nice large purse that came with no internal dividers, therefore, everything was in the same space, it was so hard to find things, I used to joke that i had to &amp;#34;dive&amp;#34; into my purse to find anything!  Then, I came across the Sodial organizer, it was offered at a GREAT price, so I decided to give it a try.  Oh it has made a HUGE difference!  It fits an amazing amount of things! it was two zipper pouches on the sides and it has a middle open compartment, it also has small pockets on both sides.  The side zipper pockets fit a kindle or a small book, the outside pockets fit a cell phone and other small items.  If you are looking for a purse organizer that works, look no further!  It takes a while to ship since it comes from overseas but be patient, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product and I recommed it to all!</li>
    <li> This organizer has been great for me. It has not only helped to keep me organized so I can find my keys but I have to switch back and forth from my purse to a diaper bag and I can just move it back and forth between the two and always have everything I need.</li>
    <li> Very good bag organizer. Well design. Good quality. Perfect size. Good price. Fast shipment. Every thing is better than expectation. 5 star.</li>
    <li> OMG how did I live without one of these.  I can change purses in seconds. This produce is well made, tons of room, easy to insert and remove, can also be used alone, like for weekend trips to hold meds or makeup. Price is outstanding and I will be ordering a couple more. I just wish they carried more colors.</li>
    <li> I love this product received it and open it up right away. Very impressive the handle shown on the bag is yellow but I received it in grey which I like because it hides dirty messes better. It have 2 snaps bottoms on each side which is pretty cool so if you need to expand the bag to put more stuff in you can have the option too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchase 3 one for myself and two as gifts ..wished i bought more makes a great Christmas gift for all the special ladies in my life.</li>
    <li> I got this organizer for my Miche Classic an my Prima.  I love it. Its a lttle taller then my classic bag but it is still better then the miche organizer.</li>
    <li> I love this product and the price is unbelievable. I have seen similar items for 5 times as much and was tempted to buy them. This bag is very sturdy and I love all the compartments. I don&#x27;t switch purses that much, but i have a bag that doesn&#x27;t have compartments and I can never find anything inside. This iinsert s a great help to keep my purse organized.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but it&#x27;s nice and roomy, and I can use it in my tote (I do not use purses) to hold everything. There are plenty of pockets, and it can be snapped closed for smaller &amp;#34;loads,&amp;#34; or unzipped for more space. I didn&#x27;t care what color it was, as it&#x27;s much cheaper in the gray and yellow from SODIAL than in a fancy color from somewhere else.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for, at a fraction of the cost of many others.  Numerous pockets, 2 zipper compartments, and a large main compartment.  Fits perfectly in my new BIG bag with room to spare for larger items.  Will come in handy when I want to switch purses or take out to make my bag roomier.  Thanks so much, I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase!</li>
    <li> The pouch fits so many small items I carry around daily in a highly organized way. I am very happy with it because now it takes no time to transfer all these items from one tote or messenger bag to another. The fabric of the pouch is soft, and most compartments are padded. The design looks nice. Awesome value and well worth the wait; it is shipped from Hong Kong so takes longer to arrive.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this product (I had my doubts given the price)! It holds SO much &amp; the little handles make it easy to move from bag to bag. I&#x27;m going to order a few more!</li>
    <li> I definitely like having the additional organization in my purse.  But not only would I prefer it to black so it blends with the inside, but I also would have liked it to be made of a more firm material.  Sometimes I have a difficult time getting my wallet and other items inside the zippered areas because the sections are so soft and cushy.  But otherwise it was a great deal and would recommend it.  It was actually recommended to me by a friend.</li>
    <li> I wanted sides to be a little harder so i cut cardboard and slid it in the sides and bottom or organizer and now it stands up by itself. There are so many pockets everything has a place. Love this.</li>
    <li> I hate changing purses.  I also dislike trying to find things in a big purse that doesn&#x27;t have many compartments.  This little pouch makes it easy for me to switch between purses in a minute, and there are tons of compartments to keep things organized so you&#x27;re not always fishing for things.  I&#x27;m not crazy about the color, but you can&#x27;t see it when it&#x27;s in the purse.  This is a very convenient and affordable solution.</li>
    <li> I have two other popular purse organizers, but neither have all the features/size I really need.  I figured for the price - a fraction of what the others cost, I would give this a try.  Shipping took a while, but I expected that coming from another country, plus it was free, so I sure didn&#x27;t mind the wait.  :)  When it arrived (well packed), I was THRILLED!  It&#x27;s a wonderful larger size but still fits in even my smaller tote purses.  I love the bright yellow top edge, which makes it super easy to find in my deeper purses.  There are wonderful deep zippered pockets on each side, snaps to expand to a really nice wide width, and fairly sturdy mesh pockets on both exterior sides.  The organizer is divided into two interior sections and this space is free of any pockets, which makes it much less frustrating than my other organizers, and great for larger items (like a hairbrush) or just fitting more stuff in.  There are two small loop handles in the middle, easy enough to be tucked away but great for a quick grab to change purses and also to be carried on it&#x27;s own!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m totally impressed with the quality, sturdiness, and look of this product!  The grey material is a nicely padded water-resistant nylon.  Zipper pulls are nicely made, and the mesh is not super cheap like I was honestly expecting!  The color scheme, quality, and design make this so versatile that I seriously just came back to order FOUR more for my own use and for gift-giving!  My hubby can use this for personal care items in his suitcase, my teenage son can use this in the car next to his seat to store gum, books, phone, portable game system, etc., my grandparents can use this to organize their daily meds and many pill bottles along with pockets for pens, notepad, etc on their kitchen counter.  I probably sound like a commercial, lol, but honestly I&#x27;m just a thrilled mama who appreciates a great deal on a nicely made and truly useful product!  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you try it and enjoy as much as my family does!  Thanks for taking the time to read my review and hope it has been helpful in some way.  :)family does!  Thanks for taking the time to read my review and hope it has been helpful in some way.  :)</li>
    <li> This product far exceeded my expectation.  I have been looking for a purse organizer for a few months.  I could not find any available in any of our local stores.  It seems the ones than I ran across on the internet did not have zippered pockets.  My old handbag had zippered pockets that I used for important papers.  I found this product on Amazon.com and it was a mere $3.95.  Therefore I bought two ($7.90) not knowing what to expect in reality.  But how can a person go wrong for $7.90.  Once it arrived, which did take about three weeks I was shocked.  The product truly was just like the picture shows it to be.  The zippered pockets are just what I was looking for in a purse organizer.  I only needed one of the two that I bought so I will save the other one for a friend that may need one in the future.  Now, I have a $1500 handbag with a $3.95 purse organizer in it.</li>
    <li> Worked quite well until it fell apart.  That took only about a week.  Not very good quality.  Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a great thing to have to keep your purse organized and to be able to switch purses with ease.  It has lots of compartments for organizing.  I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Too small and flimsy..</li>
    <li> Great organizer. I use it for jewelry while traveling.</li>
    <li> Thank you received the order in excellent condition</li>
    <li> This organizer is the right size for a large handbag, and it has a lot of pockets, allowing me to compartmentalize a lot of items.  However, it is soft sided, so whenever I want to put my wallet in the center, the whole thing smooshes/slouches down and I have to use two hands to work the wallet in.  Very frustrating.  It is as advertised though, so I gave it three stars.  But I recommend finding something with a stiff skeleton so that it&#x27;s easier to slide items in.</li>
    <li> I llike this pouch very much.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Does and looks exactly as advertised!!!</li>
    <li> I like this organizer. I only wish it were a little longer.</li>
    <li> looked cheap and is very small. so disappointed</li>
    <li> I love these!!  Ive ordered for friends  &amp; family &amp; they love them as well.  This holds tons of stuff &amp; keeps it all organized.  I dont carry large purses, so that is not the application I use them for, but I do use them for make up etc &amp; as a toiletry bag when traveling.  Great Product!!</li>
    <li> The center console has no padding under it.  I put my phone in this portion, then quickly realized it&#x27;s not padded.</li>
    <li> I brought as a gift for someone who really wanted to try this out and use it inside their purse. I thought it looked O.K. when I received it in the mail. The person I got it for is still using it.</li>
    <li> I like it so much. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Middle does not close, so if you have big things to put in the middle of this, they will fall out if you use this for travel! Crap.  I threw mine away.</li>
    <li> Disappointed with organizer. Lining is black, which makes it difficult to find things. There are side snaps to expand size. One snap broke as I unsnapped it.Since returning to Hong Kong is prohibitive, I&#x27;ll find another use for it.</li>
    <li> Perfect size, great construction.  It fits perfectly in my purse and is so well made I have hope that it will last for years.  Tons of pockets, too.  For a mom of three that is helpful!!!</li>
    <li> These are just what you see -- they will be a great purse or tote bag organizer if you want to drop it into any bag, or it would also be a handy &amp;#34;make up or toiletry&amp;#34; bag for travel.  Can&#x27;t beat the price, good deal.</li>
    <li> This handbag pouch bag is great. I love how it will fit my medium bags and also my larger handbags. I can fit all of my things in this pouch and I still have lots of room to more stuff. I would recommend this pouch bag to anyone. You won&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
    <li> This works well with the purse I already have. It keeps things organized. I am glad I purchased this item.</li>
    <li> A friend had recommended that I try a purse organizer after watching me dig and dig for my keys one day.  I am an admitted purse slob.  This is a good solution for me as it not only keeps things together in my purse but makes it pretty simple to swap purses in a hurry. It is slightly challenging to wedge into my smaller purse but does fir with a little wiggling and, overall, a big time (and mess) saver for me.  It could be a bit more rigid to help see the areas inside the organizer a bit easier but still a huge improvement for me.</li>
    <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the size. It looked larger in the picture so I was dissappointed when I got it. It also took a long time to receive.</li>
    <li> This bag is useless. Even if it costs only about 4 dolloars, nobody would buy it. Furthermore. I wait for 3 weeks to get it with disappointment.</li>
    <li> This works perfect in large hand bags so that you do not need to reorganize every time you change purses. Also no items fall to bottom so you can&#x27;t find it. Can also be used just for cosmetics.</li>
    <li> For the price, I think it&#x27;s a great thing to have, especially women who like big purses and change often.</li>
    <li> I have a work bag, an everyday bag, special occasions another bag. It is now easier then ever to switch they out and still be organized.</li>
    <li> I have always wanted a purse organizer as I tend to prefer large purses and then everything would get jumbled in the bottom.  I just didn&#x27;t want the pay the high prices that they usually run.  This one was inexpensive enough that I decided to take a chance on it.  I am very pleasantly surprise.  It has all the pockets that I could possibly need to be organized and is very sturdy.  I recommend it to anyone that is looking to get their purse or even their backpack organized.</li>
    <li> It is definitely something for larger bags. I don&#x27;t know why I thought this was for small purses, so that is my fault for not reading more thorough. I have not used it yet because I do not carry large bags regularly, but I am sure when I do (if I do) this insert will come in handy.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but this organizer should work very well for keeping small items organized in my car.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product three weeks ago. It says it has been shipped...but I haven&#x27;t received it yet. I&#x27;ve read other reviews that it took a long time to ship. I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll love the product WHEN I get it, but it&#x27;s the waiting that&#x27;s taking forever.</li>
    <li> I rated it a 5 because I like everything about it.  It is exactly what I expected and I def would recommend it to others.  The size is perfect and I like all the compartments.  It is very light weight which is also nice.  I use it for work, carry my pens/pencils, paper, keys, maps, a bottle of water, and a few small tools I need on the job.</li>
    <li> The handbag organiser has many pockets to help keep you handbag organised.&lt;br /&gt;When you need to change your handbag it is made so you can take it quickly out of one and put it in another.  The only thing is I wish it was a little smaller.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to use as an insert for a large purse or tote to hold &amp; protect my dslr when I don&#x27;t need to carry a full camera bag.  The pouch is lightly padded, generously sized and has plenty of pockets for several accessories. I must say it exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> Nice product! I like the product, nice color and seems to be sturdy!  I would recommend to anyone who needs to get organized.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use for my boarding bag for an upcoming airline trip. I wanted a way to be able to organize the contents of the bag a bit. This fits nicely in a standard size boarding bag (with lots of extra room). It seems to be well built and arrived as described. My iPad fit fine in the center compartment, along with a paperback book and a puzzle book with room to spare. There are two zipper compartments on each side of the center one and I placed a AAA guidebook and a city map in one. Perfect fit. Haven&#x27;t used the other one yet. Each side has several pockets/pouches. I placed a mini notebook, full sized pen, pencil and iPad stylus in one, and I&#x27;ve used one of the other ones for chapstick, aspirin, electronic cables etc. and still have room to space. It fits inside the main pouch of my boarding bag and still gives me room for a water bottle and a full sized notebook. I am glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> This is so helpful keeping makeup, etc in certain places so I don&#x27;t have to look all over for them.</li>
    <li> It stands up in my purse, has more pockets than I need which is FANTASTIC, is expandable, and keeps me organized (which I love, because I have NO PATIENCE for rooting through my purse for my phone and my glasses!)  Well worth the price and the wait for delivery from Hong Kong.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when my order came in the mail earlier than expected.  I had purchased a purse  just big enough to put this organizer in it.  It  was an amazing fit and I feel so organized now!!  It is everything  i had expected  !!!</li>
    <li> It will do the job.  Has many pouches and pockets for my things in my purse and changing purses will be so much easier.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product off of ebay for four dollars in lime green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product it fits perfectly in my medium sized purses. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I just love it.Its very useful.&lt;br /&gt;It perfectly fits in my purse and my purse can remain tidy and organised.&lt;br /&gt;I am planning to purchase more of these for my cousin and friends.&lt;br /&gt;After using this for a while I am very satisfied As I am always organised.</li>
    <li> It is a good hand bag helper, I can put lots things in my bag now and easy to find them without digging in my bag.&lt;br /&gt;I like it .</li>
    <li> The organizer is exactly as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Best price on these I&#x27;ve seen.&lt;br /&gt;Would reccomend to others.</li>
    <li> I like to change my bags and purses, depending (a little) on what I am wearing, but (more so) on where I am going and who I am with--most likely my two little ones!  So, this insert is perfect!  I can put all the essential items in this pouch bag and then easily transfer it between bags.</li>
    <li> I Love it-- this cool pouch holds lots --It&#x60;s roomy and  it fits in my purses really well!! Thank you</li>
    <li> Great ways to organize my purse.  I will definitely purchase more for family and friends. Hope to see similar style in smaller sizes.</li>
    <li> I have only had this just one week.  I thought at first that it would be really great other than the zippers stuck a little but just a week later one of the zippers is broken.  I really like the idea of the bag but it seems rather poor quality materials.  I guess for the price I can&#x27;t expect the best quality.</li>
    <li> The quality of the bag was better than I even expected. I&#x27;m only hoping it wasn&#x27;t made with slave labor considering how cheap it was! It doesn&#x27;t smell like many synthetic products would (sometimes I buy things and can&#x27;t stand them because they perpetually smell of intense plastic and chemicals). Fit into my purse with ease, very nice product for the price.</li>
    <li> Nice purse organizer for larger handbags. Lots of room and pockets to keep things neat. Handles to lift out of handbag to make it easier to transfer contents.</li>
    <li> Golly Suzam, the baby is good. Excellent item to carry your coupons, cell phone, and anything you desire. fantastic item.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews but i feel like i owe one for this product.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it because of the price (under $4 with shipping), and it did take a long time to get here (three weeks) but i have to say the quality is not bad. It&#x27;s very soft, not stiff at all, and it has handles so it&#x27;s easy to move from one purse to another.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommended it.</li>
    <li> feel the product def. is worth more than the cost. it takes a while to ship, but since its fs, i dont think i wanna complain about that.</li>
    <li> So I saw a bag just like this but with different colors on groupon for $20.  I found it on here for like 3 and they paid the shipping.  I figured it would come from china or something because it was so cheap and I was a little worried about the quality of the product.  I was quite surprised how well it was made.  One of the zipper pulls was a little frayed, but other than that the stitching was even and nice.  seems durable, great size for my purse, and cost next to nothing.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> So enjoy how this little inner pouch keeps me organized and so easy to lift and transfer to any one of my other purses.</li>
    <li> Pretty small and ugly. You get what you pay for. There are ten more words required so that is what I will type :)</li>
    <li> This may be a strange reason for purchasing this product, but I ride a Harley Davidson touring bike with a large tour box on the back.  This back allows me to carry small items in the tour box with out losing them.  ie: things like camera, memory cards, chap stick, pen and paper, sun screen, maps, just about anything that I want to keep handy,  It has many pockets and pouches without being overly larger, and I can easly remove it if I want to take the small thing with me when I get of the bike.</li>
    <li> This is fine.  I really don&#x27;t know what I was expecting for the prices. Funny smelling, but hope that will go away in time.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a friend because she is always misplacing her items in her purse....she called me 3 days after she had been using it to let me know how she liked it....Lots of compartments, zippers are large and easy to open/close, fits perfectly into her 11&amp;#34; handbags, the mesh is very durable.  I will be ordering me one next.  this is the best price that I&#x27;ve seen them selling for. I would recommend this product....</li>
    <li> No more time consuming and inconvenience chaging purses. Everything is orgnized and I just slip it out and place it in another purse.</li>
    <li> It keeps my stuff, more specifically make up, organized so I&#x27;m happy with it. It&#x27;s not like omg amazing it&#x27;s simple and does the job.</li>
    <li> I bought this with the idea I *might* need it for a messenger bag I had purchased here on Amazon. After debating long and hard about which one might work best for me, I made my choice. As it turned out, the messenger bag was not right for me, but I&#x27;ll review that bag later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This \\&quot;Handbag Pouch Bag\\&quot; was an amazing find, and for a very reasonable price. I bought it from a different seller, and for a slightly different price, but the bag is surprisingly well-made. It has an open center section, and a zipper section on each end, with lots of open mesh pockets on each side. It also has a flat bottom for stability. I like that it has two small handles, so you can fill it with whatever you normally carry in your bag, then just lift it out, intact, and change bags easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The messenger bag I wanted to use it with was mostly a good idea. Since I wasn&#x27;t going to be carrying textbooks or a laptop, I was correct that I was left with a single, cavernous open compartment. So I put this bag insert inside, and while it did its job well, the messenger bag was still too big. I&#x27;ll be returning that bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought another messenger bag, again at Amazon, which is just a slight bit smaller, and with this handbag insert, it&#x27;s made ALL the difference. This latest messenger bag does have the compartments I thought I was getting in my first bag (but did not), and this insert works perfectly now. I simply picked it up by its handles and transferred it from the really-big messenger bag to the not-as-big messenger bag, and I was ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s well-made, reasonably-priced, and while I&#x27;ve only had it about a month so far, it appears durable. It&#x27;s shipped from Hong Kong, but arrived promptly. I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase and the seller, WE MARKET.</li>
    <li> great organizer fits perfect inside purse not cheaply made like others say&lt;br /&gt;i really like it , will end .up buying more for gifts. will recommend this product</li>
    <li> it is ok not exactly what I was expecting but it is ok for the money over all i am satisfied</li>
    <li> I use this as a diaper bag organizer and it holds everything perfectly.  Well designed.  Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> Was pleased with my purchase.. Great value for the price I paid... And It arrived earlier than the estimated arrival date...</li>
    <li> It organizes so well I can&#x27;t find anything.  I did have a problem with it flipping around in my purse.  Finally just took it out and using it in my craft room to organize some things.</li>
    <li> This organizer is soooo efficient! I used to use one bag for months because I am too lazy to dig out all the stuff to switch bags but now, I change a bag a day. :) It is sooooooo convenient. I love all the side pockets too because I can organize my makeup away from  the gum. The middle pockets are huge too! Overall, LOVE IT! :)</li>
    <li> Ripped immediately. At least it was cheap I guess. Now it holds band aids in my car, so NOT a total loss.</li>
    <li> I bought this with really low expectations for the price (under $5) But was really surprised, not only are the pockets quite wonderful, it is super easy to move from one bag to another, or pop out if I am somewhere where I will need to access these items frequently. (I keep pens, calculator, planner, scissors,  crochet hooks, etc...) I pull it out at meetings that I know I&#x27;ll be doing a lot of organizing/writing, I pull it out at sporting events for my crocheting. It&#x27;s quite wonderful! There are snaps on the sides to make it a bit smaller if  you&#x27;d like to and you can just snap the top for tighter on top bags.&lt;br /&gt;My main gripe is that the zippers stick, kind of a lot. I can get them open and closed, but they still still and I have to hold the fabric a certain way to get it to zip.</li>
    <li> Since it was so cheap I was expecting cheap but surprisingly this is a nice purse insert! Lots of extra pockets and fits great in my purse!</li>
    <li> This is so much better than the expensive organizers. A lot of pockets and zippered compartments. Shipping took a while but it was worth the wait, the price is a steal!</li>
    <li> This was an excellent purchase! I was a bit hesitant that it was so cheap but it is well made and has been a great organizational item in my life!</li>
    <li> THis insert has changed my life! I have a bunch of purses but never switched them out, would just use the same one for a long time, then switch to another for a long time. It was too much hassle to rearrange everything. Now it&#x27;s easy! Just pull the insert out and put into the other bag. It also makes it easy to find things, where before I&#x27;d be digging around looking for keys, a pen, etc.&lt;br /&gt;And it was really inexpensive!</li>
    <li> This product came very quickly, which was a surprise since it was coming from China. This organizer has a lot of pockets and pouches for maximum functionality. Can be made wider or narrower as needed. I have recommended this organizer to friends.</li>
    <li> It ain&#x27;t at all fancy but it certainly does the job. It is so nice to pull out this little bag and place it in another purse. Used it in my back pack this week-end.</li>
    <li> This item is excellent for what I paid, around $4.50.  It was bigger than I thought it would be.  I wish the material were a bit more firmer so that it will remain its shape.  However, again, it&#x27;s a very good buy for this price.  I am using it everyday in my tote.</li>
    <li> I love this idea of the pouch in a bag because every time I switch bags I know this is the only thing that I&#x27;m going to be taking in and out of my bank and I love when my bags are clear colored because with this grey I can see everything that&#x27;s in my purse my change purse is a bright color my Calendar is a bright color of my pens are bright color so when I put it in my pouch I can see it right away and it&#x27;s so nice because of slips and slides out of my purse and it organized everything i mean that I can go on and on I just love it it&#x27;s just the right size ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡</li>
    <li> I got it like $4 and i think it is better than i expected.&lt;br /&gt;it is easy to switch from one bag to other bag.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it as a A+++++</li>
    <li> Way better than expected for the price. I&#x27;m shocked that the price was so low. Love it. Has expandable snaps, two zipper pockets... very nice.</li>
    <li> It saves space in my bag.. love this bad boy as it organized my bag well!!!</li>
    <li> For the price, you just can&#x27;t beat this organizer.  I have a bunch of them that I leave in my bags to help them keep their shape on the shelf.</li>
    <li> I was afraid of buying one of the other bags that cost more - so I thought I would try this one first.  I must admit that I really like it because I am able to fit &amp;#34;just about everything&amp;#34; I need in my purse.  I bought 2 of them and gave one away - so I hope the other person likes it as much as me.  For the price and storage - I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The product is ok, I gave it a neutral rating because it is a little too large to fit in most purses.  However, the company is being almost harassing trying to force me to up my rating, or delete it.  I will not buy from this company again.  Feedback is only good if it is real, I do not appreciate the daily e mails and phone calls to try and get me to change my real opinion.</li>
    <li> This is as described.  The zippers stick a little on both sides, so it&#x27;s definitely a product that you get what you pay for, but I am using it at this time.</li>
    <li> Great organizer.  You can just take the whole thing and put it into another purse without having to organize your purse again.  Helps me to stay organized and not just throw things in my purse.</li>
    <li> Bought this with some trepidation not sure what to expect, it arrived last night and was perfect in every way, is exactly what I was looking for.. was 29 (Long)x 10 (deep) x 16 (tall) in Cm and is just as shown in the photo.</li>
    <li> The SODIAL organizer is wonderfully lightweight, yet sturdily constructed. Exactly as advertised!  I plan to use it as a makeup bag.</li>
    <li> This won&#x27;t stay up in my purse and always gets tangled in everything.  Unless I actually take the time to make sure its standing completely upright things end up just falling to the bottom of my purse.  Definitely needs to be more sturdy.</li>
    <li> Hesitant to buy at first, but gave it a shot for such a low cost. Great item, very decent quality. Definite buy for those bottomless pit bags.</li>
    <li> It drives me absolutely crazy when I can&#x27;t find stuff in my purse. Fortunately for me, someone in China also has this issue and created this little organizer. The price was great, it&#x27;s got lots of little compartments, and the shipping was really fast. Good product for feeding the tiny OCD monster!</li>
    <li> I love this purse organizer. I have purchased 9 of them so far - I&#x27;m giving them to girfriends so they can organize their large handbags. Love, Love Love them.&lt;br /&gt;Purchased from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I wish there were smaller sizes as these fit in only large handbags.  I use only medium size handbags.  They are useful for use in carry-on bags while traveling too.</li>
    <li> Item received very promptly. Very good quality for a very fair price. I love that it is versatile and it allows me to keep everything organized, from makeup, to coupons and receipts. It allows me to switch purses in a snap as I can get everything I need in the organizer. The item is very light weight and not too big so it seems like it can be used with most purses big or small. I will definitely recommend this item to anyone wanting to get their purse organized.</li>
    <li> This is a very handy organizer with many pockets and handles for easy transfer to your next handbag. Only downside is that it slips around and I find it upside down sometimes. The pockets hold well though, so nothing falls out</li>
    <li> I never change purses because just the idea of taking everything out and move to another purse makes me go nuts. I have too much stuff and of course i feel that i need everything. I decided to buy this item to see if i can keep my purse more organized and finally start using my other purses. The pouch is perfect. It is not small, but if fits my purse with no problem. It is sturdy and flexible and everything fits in, except my oversize wallet, but that is no problem for me.....and i love that it has so many different compartments. It was a great purchase at a great price.</li>
    <li> Just the product I was looking for.  I bought 2!  I have a spot for everything in my bag.  Great bag organizer.</li>
    <li> I have a business bag that was in desperate need of something to organize my smaller items.  For the price, this organizer is very well made, and works perfectly for my needs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was delivered from an outside vender - and was probably the FASTEST order I&#x27;ve ever received in my life!  I&#x27;d order from them again - they are amazing.  Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> This is my second handbag organizer, and I really like it. It is true to the description and the pictures. I had seen the same one through a customer and I had to have it. I was satisfied with the price and with the shipping time. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I have used this for every trip, restaurant, church visit since getting it.  It has amazing storage capacity for small, thin books, crayons, markers, chapstick, hand sanitizer, small toys, paper, snacks!  And you can just lift this in and out of any bag and have everything with you all the time.  So awesome.</li>
    <li> i have a &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; bag that i need during the week because i work in a warehouse and it gets filth. On the weekends, i just pop this out and toss it into a another nicer bag and everything comes with it. helps keep organized too.</li>
    <li> This purse organizer has kept me so organized. I have pockets for everything I need. This was especially handy went we went to the parks in Orlando. I was able to keep everything I needed in the organizer &amp; was easily able to find everything. Fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> a little bigger then i though it would be but has a great amount of storage space- it will work perfectly in my work bag</li>
    <li> This is a great organizer for your favorite purse that does not have dividers or pockets. It helps keep things in order.</li>
    <li> Very nice organizer got here really quick which was nice...looks kinda cheap but hey u get what you pay for</li>
    <li> All fabric construction. Well made. Two short handles help you to remove it from your handbag and place it into another. This is one well put together organizer.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price for something that holds all of my facial care products in one place. It makes everything nice and neat. The zippers are a little bit sticky but not too bad. I think it will hold up--I&#x27;ve only had it for about a week. Nice product for a wonderful price. I just ordered a second one to use in my car.</li>
    <li> I use it very single day now. It holds all my daily items in place, makes switching hand bag very easy and fast. It is very light. Quality is decent, and price is so good. It definitely worth the long waiting time. I have been using if for 4 month now, no issues.</li>
    <li> Im very happy now I can change bags easily before I used to carry one handbag because it was so hard to transfer everything from one bag to the other now im enjoying all my bag .</li>
    <li> I am so happy with my purchase, I plan buying another one, love love love love it. One of the buys I ever made.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok, nothing against the product, just not working with purses i had in mind as well as i&#x27;d hoped</li>
    <li> Not quite what I expected from the pictures but it works okay. Rather floppy over all. Does not show the too small handles that get in the way. Center compartment does not have any closure at all.One zipper is not sown on straight so it tugs when you try to zip or unzip. Still, it does hold a lot and keeps most things where I want.</li>
    <li> This is the best product ever. I love it for couponing. The compartments are awesome. Great product. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This organizer fits my medium and large purses. It has enough compartments to keep me organized.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I take it on all my trips. It&#x27;s a good way to be organized when going on a trip!</li>
    <li> Great product, I purchased one for my daughter and one for myself.  We both and very happy with our purse organizers.</li>
    <li> exactly as advertised.  fits my purse well. the second one is for a birthday gift so hope she will like it.</li>
    <li> Works great! Very easy to transfer my belongings from one purse to the other I use big purses so this was a great size for me. I also liked the slight padding to prtect my things.</li>
    <li> love it love it!!! can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t had one before now!! Don&#x27;t know where I would be without it.....makes up for purses having too few pockets on the inside!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this item. It keeps my bag organized. Do yourself a favor and purchase item Handbag Lovers!!! I am glad I did.</li>
    <li> Poor quality.  It has 2 handles so that you can pull it up out of your purse.  One handle was not sewn in properly, so as soon as I lifted the organizer, the handle ripped out.</li>
    <li> its just what i needed  for myself and those big bags everything got lost in the black interior of i could dig around for hours and not find a thing before.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this organizer as all the reviews sounded great.  As soon as I unzipped it, it would no longer zip. Both zippers broke before I even used it.  Zippers are very cheap.  Guess I get what u pay for.  Contacted seller to get $ back.  Don&#x27;t buy this, total waste of time and money!</li>
    <li> What a great great product.  I just love this.  It does come from China, it takes a while to get it.  But It is worth it.  And yes you do get it..  Very nice</li>
    <li> It ripped already, with nothing sharp in in , I&#x27;m very disappointed in the quality and craftsmen ship. Good little pouch, holds everything separate am you don&#x27;t really lose anything.</li>
    <li> I had another purse organizer but there were only pockets on the inside and they were hard to get into. Everything ended up in the black hole in the middle so it wasn&#x27;t much better than having nothing. I like that this one has 2 zippered compartments &amp; mesh pockets on the outside as well as additional outside pockets. I&#x27;ve looked at a lot of purse organizers over the years &amp; bought some. This is the best I&#x27;ve come across. Bought an extra for my SIL because she is always losing things in her car. I should have bought a 3rd to use for my quilting tools when I go to my weekend retreats. This would also be perfect for a crafter, sewer, quilter or even to use for drill bits, small tools, etc.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I have been wanting for my purse and my crafts! Lots of pockets for great organization. Better quality fabric than I thought it would be, considering the price.</li>
    <li> This purchase has been very convenient for my purposes.  I find that I am able to locate easily what every I am looking for without wasting time rambling through the whole purse.  When I change purses I simple take the pouch out and insert in the next purse.  Great purchase and I love it!</li>
    <li> It was everything I wanted and more. So happy with my purchase. Will buy another one. Was so worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that something this inexpensive could be so good, but the cost was so low that I decided it was worth a try. I expected something that was just o.k., but this is really all I could have hoped for and more. It is very well made, it has lots of storage compartments, and it does exactly what I need it to do, which is to allow me to quickly transfer all the essentials from one purse to another. While it is too large for some of my purses, it fits nicely into backpacks, briefcases, and large purses. The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is the bright yellow trim, but I must say that it makes the pouch easy to spot in my backpack. All in all, this is a great product at an amazing price.</li>
    <li> This is the best organizer around.  I love it.  Just wish it had arrived sooner.  It is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> My bag arrived with parts not stitched. It is not that big of a deal for me, I was able to quickly stitch the places together but the point is that I shouldn&#x27;t have to. The zippers are cheap plastic and get stuck half of the time. You get what you pay for...</li>
    <li> I love how many pockets and zippers there are to hold everything. The material is really light, so it doesn&#x27;t add weight to my purse like some other organizers. No complaints at all.</li>
    <li> Un organizador del tama&amp;ntilde;o adecuado, finalmente he logrado organizar mi cartera y cambiar de bolso sin traumas, estoy muy satisfecha, tanto que he comprado varios para regalar, me parece un regalo maravilloso y pr&amp;aacute;ctico, me encantan los bolsillos de cierre porque son seguros y los laterales de malla porque permite revisar f&amp;aacute;cilmente lo que llevas, el bolsillo central es amplio cabe perfectamente la billetera, el estuche de jafas, el cuaderno de apuntes y m&amp;aacute;s cosas si deseas.  Lo recomiendo</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better than i expects. Size is just fit for my handbag. It can organize so many stuff. good quality, good choice.</li>
    <li> I only gave 4 stars because i havent had it long and part of the stitching by the handle came undone but its very much still functional, since i keep it in my purse dont use it as a bag in itself. Overall its one of my favorite purchases functional and lots of space. keeps things organized especially when you need to add or remove items you dont have to dump everything out, just remove the entire bag unpack and repack.</li>
    <li> Where can you get anything for under $4 anymore? Even a \\&quot;HappyMeal\\&quot; costs more. This is a great little product and would fit most medium to large handbags. Very practical and keeps your handbags clean too! Just ordered another for my Mom.</li>
    <li> I showed the girls my new pouch and everyone was super impressed with  the idea. I would suggest different size options but I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> As Always, just make a cardboard insert for bottom and much more functional...Love the see through compartments and zippered area for personal items....Best one I have bought for the money.. Free shipping is extremely slow but definitely worth the wait..</li>
    <li> i love it and it can fold to fit in almost every purse. it is exactly what i wanted and more and has so many perfect compartments that it seems ridiculous to have not had it before</li>
    <li> Its okay....don&#x27;t have a problem!  Just have to get used to it............ordered one for my girlfriend too! Easy to pull bag out to search for misplaced items.</li>
    <li> It was a little bigger than I had anticipated. Wanted to organize my carry-on back pack for an overseas trip but it was a little too large for that. I will try to find another use for it.</li>
    <li> much smaller than what the picture shows. zippers are in bad quality. However, you should not expect too much at this price.</li>
    <li> looks as presented, i have not used it yet, but looks like it meets the requirements to sort my stuff.</li>
    <li> Although others have commented about the inferior product they received, the one I got was well made. I&#x27;m very pleased at how spacious it is, and it has plenty of pockets to hold most of my things. I would buy another one.</li>
    <li> Thx i like the stuff that i just ordered it was perfect with good quality n the service was amazing n it arrived at the exactly time thx a lot</li>
    <li> I can grab this out of my purse and stick it in another purse in 2 seconds! It&#x27;s large enough and the compartments are awesome!</li>
    <li> I am not the biggest fan of the color of this product (I bought the grey with yellow zippers), but who sees inside your purse anyways???  It really took the mess inside my purse and made it all organized.  I now know where everything is, and that is a time saver to this mama of four!  Plus, if you are the type of person who loves to change out their purse, this makes it easy to transfer most of your things.  It is a well made product, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing purse organizer. It holds so much more than it looks like it can. Keeps all my items in one place. No digging around in the bottom of my bag, and can be moved from bag to bag with ease.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got a hobo style bag, I love the look of it but get tired of fumbling around for what I need.  This product is the perfect solution.  My daughter sawed it, loved it, and I bought one for her.  Showed it to my sister, she loved it, bought one for her.  I&#x27;m thinking about buying 2 more for my daughters in law.  This would also be a great product for people who like to change purses frequently, just grab and go.</li>
    <li> Love this little but most important dandy tool for my purses organization!!!!!  Everyone should have one.  There is room for everything in it.</li>
    <li> I love handbags and change them quite often, so I love this insert. All I need do now is lift the insert and put it in another bag. Inexpensive but seems to be holding up well.</li>
    <li> Love this.  I purchased two and was going to give one away but decided to keep them both, one for purse and the other for my sewing bag.</li>
    <li> Keeps everything in my purse organized. When I want to switch purses it is easy to remove and put in the new one. It is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Very convenient, it does just what it says it does Organize!</li>
    <li> Well I expected it to be smaller but it being bigger than j thought is okay.</li>
    <li> Bought this through a site that claimed it was worth a lot more in value than it actually was. I should have looked on Amazon to see the general worth of them. The site also made them seem more high quality (and that you could fit iPads in some of the putter pockets. I could just barely fit my iPad mini in one of the outer pockets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I got it, I realized I indeed got what I paid for. Cheap quality. I zipped a couple of items in to test the waters with it, and the zipper was stuck immediately. I was afraid I was going to have to cut it open to get my darn psvita out of the stupid thing. I managed to get the zipper to work, but still. It&#x27;s something to look out for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it two stars because I suffer bad anxiety and I can use this to carry around essential oils bottles. Since I lack a bag for those still. It really only deserves one star in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This is great to organize a tote.</li>
    <li> this is such a useful organizer!  I love all of the little pockets and the how much storage there is.  I need a bigger purse to fit it into, but it&#x27;s great for holding all of that &amp;#34;loose&amp;#34; stuff.</li>
    <li> It is not as sturdy as I though it was going to be, however it will work, so I will use it.</li>
    <li> i bought it because i saw it on a blog i follow, onehundreddollarsamonth.com and it was cheap. i thought it would be cheap quality but it seems perfect. all the zippers work, it looks exactly like the photo. it holds ALL of my stuff from my purse and then some. even has room for my kindle! i can easily switch out purses without loosing stuff and dealing with switching stuff out. i only wish there was a side zipper, then it would be fantastic! you cant beat it for the price. and i happen to love yellow and grey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[EDIT} to include use and wear. product still works, however the  yellow handle on the top has come apart form main bag part.</li>
    <li> i got it for myself and so far it is a good idea because it keep everything organize in my bag</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the easy organization and it fits in most every purse I already own. No more forgetting to transfer something important to another purse.</li>
    <li> not big and fluffy as in overstuffed and puffy. Not heavy&lt;br /&gt;either. I put it in  my purse right away. What a difference.</li>
    <li> Good size! Has plenty of pockets and the best thing is that they are outside of it. Good material! But if you plan to use it for a small puede might be too big. Works very we&#x27;ll with medium size to large purses! Very happy with it, i use it everoday!!&#x27;</li>
    <li> I love this organizer insert for handbag. My bag usually was big mess and difficult to find the stuff. But with this organizer insert, my bag become very light and neat.</li>
    <li> This organizer is so cool, it fits in any bag. you can git so many things inside and find easily. I love love love it..The best thing yet. it arrived few weeks before it was due. GREAT BUY</li>
    <li> I bought this to be used as Christmas gifts for my sisters-in-law in 2013.  I kept one for myself.  It is larger than some that I had bought a few years ago and holds all of my &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It is bigger than I expected and fits everything. It is a tight fit in my midsized purse. Like the zipper sections.</li>
    <li> This pouch holds absolutely everything, it is made well made and sells for much less than  others of its kind.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. It fits everything then I can just lift it out to change purses. It has all kinds of separate pouches too. I had bought the \\&quot;As Seen On TV\\&quot; version and it was cheap and not durable at all. Excellent product for the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these for myself, and then I saw them on sale for half the original price. I happily bought additional units for friends and family.</li>
    <li> OVERVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;SAME COLOR AS IN PICTURE&lt;br /&gt;CAN EXPAND&lt;br /&gt;LIGHTWEIGHT&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;TOOK APPX A MONTH TO ARRIVE (I DIDNT EVEN REMEMBER I ORDERED IT)&lt;br /&gt;EXTREMELY SMALL, IS MORE LIKE A COSMETIC POUCH THAN A HANDBAG ORGANIZER&lt;br /&gt;CANNOT EXPAND MUCH</li>
    <li> Love this. I finally have something to slip into my purses and beach bags that helps me not have to dig all around looking for something. Would like to have one in a bigger size for some of my other bags, but this one works wonderfully for my smaller to mid-sized bags. Thanks SODIAL!!</li>
    <li> I purchased quite a few of these and have given them as gifts and have one for myself.  They were VERY reasonabley priced and are worth the cost.</li>
    <li> This bag organizer is ok, but it was too big for my purses.  I&#x27;m giving it to my daughter to try.</li>
    <li> I order this organizer for the price.  One of the side pockets is already tearing appart.  The construction not very sturdy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking at much more expensive purse organizers for a while and decided to try this one because of price before purchasing the $50 one that appeared very similar. I have to say I am very pleased. I haven&#x27;t had any problem with the zippers as others have commented.&lt;br /&gt;Something I did do was turn the entire thing inside out and then put it in my purse. I like having all of the pockets and such on the inside of the pouch, for me, it makes things easier. Since the pouch is in a laptop type purse, when I put papers or large envelopes or file folders in my bag they don&#x27;t catch in all the little pockets on the outside of the pouch, everything goes in my purse smoothly without fuss. And everything I need in the plough is nicely organized all in one spot.&lt;br /&gt;To give you an idea of how I use it, one zipper is used to hold a small accordion file with receipts and lists, the pockets on that side hold all my goodies like lotion, travel hairbrush, tooth brush and toothpaste, etc. The other side holds all of my tech gear chargers, USB and SD memory, a pocket camera, extra batteries, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps you make you decision. I&#x27;m glad I bought this instead of the $50pouch one I was comparing it to.</li>
    <li> It fits most of my bags. It is easy to use. It has just enough compartments for all of my stuff.</li>
    <li> I have ordered 3 of these......one as gift.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent organizer for handbag making it easy to change handbags.&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight.....and also helpful in backpack.</li>
    <li> I love this thing!  It instantly adds pockets and dividers to any purse or diaper bag I want to use.  Also great for keeping my things separate from baby&#x27;s in the diaper bag and makes for an easy switch to a purse.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the product. Thank you!</li>
    <li> wears well and is very handy.</li>
    <li> Special made pouches are better</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected but is working out. It took a bit getting it as it was shipped from China.</li>
    <li> Perfect - what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I was so annoyed of transferring every item, and forgetting some every time I switched purse. This pouch is perfect. It is beautiful, has lots of  pockets and you can use side snaps to make it bigger or smaller. You can&#x27;t beat the price. I was so happy with it, I immediately ordered 3 more as gift. It is shipped from Hong Kong, however the seller ships it the next day and it arrives in couple of weeks. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything fancy when I ordered this...I merely wanted something functional to help with the switching handbags quandry.  This organizer is of a size that can work with most purses and totes and has enough compartments to serve most needs.  However, IF you decide you don&#x27;t like this, as the selller told me during one of our communications, the cost to ship it back to HONG KONG would cost more than the item itself.  So the reality is, if you buy this, you are STUCK WITH IT, whether you like it or not.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this thing since she has many bags.  She&#x27;s says all her friends ask where she got it.  Apparently it makes switching bags very easy.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these and I can say I&#x27;m happy with this product. I gave one  out for Christmas and were very&lt;br /&gt;happy.  So I do recommend this to anyone. I&#x27;m telling all my friends.</li>
    <li> I used to use just one purse for stretches at a time, because of the hassle involved with switching things from purse to purse.  This pouch will make switching very quick and easy!</li>
    <li> I ordered a bunch of these to give as gifts for Christmas, they are excellent size, and the double zipper on each side is a wonderful security bonus. One of the organizer&#x27;s zipper failed, and the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; of the zipper fell out, rendering it useless. I wrote to the seller who offered a replacement. This seller&#x27;s service is A++++, and the organizer is a hit with all who received it. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> What a great product for such a low price.  I found that it is a little crowded in the pocket book I bought it for, but I can still use it and I am glad for that.</li>
    <li> Great item for the price! Delivered faster then was told. Good quality. Can&#x27;t go wrong. Can hold wallet, make up bag, my Kindle, phone etc.</li>
    <li> This product fits in my medium sized purse, and I am surprised how much space I have acquired just by having it more organized with this product. Yes, Switching it from purse to purse will be easier for me, plus it is flexible if I need to put it in something smaller. I feels like it was made with good quality material and will be an item I can use for the long run. I find items very easy as well. Thank you!</li>
    <li> i ordered this product semi expecting a low quality bad because of the price. i was very happy when i was proven wrong. it is a great quality purse organizer. very durable. i liked that there was snaps on both sides so that you can make the bag wider or thinner. definitely worth buying.</li>
    <li> Great idea  cheap materials. But you get what you pay for. The zip is soooo very hard to open. i have to use too much force and it looks like it will break soon. many pockets which are useful but now that it has come ; I see that I should have paid more money for better quality. This is just cheap fabric nylon /plastic. I actually bought three of these. gave my sister one and she likes it. It was free for her but I paid too much for this. My recommendation is to spend more money for better quality.</li>
    <li> Th bag organizer is a great size and fits into all of my bags, but the product is pretty cheaply made. By the time I opened the package, the threads were already unraveling.</li>
    <li> I use a diaper bag that doesn&#x27;t have many pockets.  I placed this inside and loaded it up.  The slick, parachute material it is made of makes it easy to slide things in and out, like diapers and wipes and the changing pad.  It has SO many little pockets for everything a baby would need.  It also has expandable sides so you can use it in a flatter position or expanded for a wider position.  I especially like the mesh pockets on the outside, so that you can see exactly what is in each one.  Love, love, love this product!  My ONLY complaint was the color.  It is perfectly fine for the inside of a bag, but I would have liked a few more choices of colors.  Most definitely a super price for such an awesome product.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product.  Takes forever to shipp here but for the price I paid, it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
    <li> I love all the pockets to place different objects. It is much easier to just pull the organizer out of my purse if I am trying to search for something in my purse.</li>
    <li> I ordered two bags, one for myself and one for my daughter. As soon as I received them, I emptied my bag and&lt;br /&gt;was so glad that the organizer bag fits into every one of my bags!  Wonderful!  They&#x27;ll make great gifts for birthdays,&lt;br /&gt;Christmas, etc....I&#x27;m so pleased!  Thank you!!!,</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical of purchasing this product because it was so inexpensive, but was I ever surprised!  It is made out of sturdy material and has many great features.  There are snaps on the sides so that you can make it smaller if you desire, zippered pouches and multiple pockets, some of them mesh.  I am so pleased with this purchase.  It is the perfect solution for my cavernous purses!</li>
    <li> This is the best purse organizer I&#x27;ve tried.  Still hoping there is something else out there, but am unwilling to pay $40-$50 to try others.  This is light weight and well made.  Makes my Michael Kors leather tote a little fat, but it does hold its shape better now!  They could make it with some different colored zippers for those of us who don&#x27;t care for &amp;#34;goldenrod&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Bought this for daily use. Arrived as expected.&lt;br /&gt;The pouch looks different. The zippers are not yellow as shown in the picture, they are grey as the rest of the bag. One zipper was broken even before I opened it. Returning.</li>
    <li> So far so good...... like it to change from purse to another purse without forgetting anything...can not wait to give 1 to each of my daughters</li>
    <li> Great concept, but cheaply made ... would be very appropriate to divide a small duffel or cosmetics case.  Has that luggage or duffel bag type feel, which just doesn&#x27;t marry well with a high end leather handbag.  I&#x27;ll keep looking.</li>
    <li> Love it! Fits in my purse and everything stays where I put it. When I change purses I will just lift it out and put it in the new purse!</li>
    <li> I took this bag along as a medicine keeper.  I like the many pockets so that I could seperate the different types of meds from others.  It is actually bigger than I had expected! Yay!</li>
    <li> Would of liked it to be a bit more stiff but love all its pockets. Would be good for a med. size purse.</li>
    <li> Great organizer!  This organizer is just what I needed, there is a place for everything and I can find things right away!  I can now buy any purse and not worry about wether it has pockets for my stuff.</li>
    <li> This organizer keeps everything in order. Wish I had ordered two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived before expected and is of high quality (better than the picture shown).</li>
    <li> el producto aduirido fue  identico al ofrecido muy completo para lo cual fue escogido  sin queja alguna hasta ahora volveria a comprarlo</li>
    <li> The bag organiser is exactly as pictured. I use it for my medium size purse and fits great! I use it as a diaper, baby/personal items organizer. The quality is great, the item is lightweight, easy to clean. I love the middle part that can be extended and I use it for a bottles. I like the variety of different pocket sizes so smaller items are not lost. Previously I&#x27;ve tried KF diaper bag insert and I returned it (too stiff, small tall pockets, not very lightweight).&lt;br /&gt;There are several colors on amazon to choose from which is great. I liked the grey and yellow combo, bo went with green, it was easier to see the side pockets and stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it from USA seller (Best Deal stores) and received it within a week (ships USPS from SoCal).</li>
    <li> It fits perfect in my tote bags and I could fit a lot of things. Comes very handy it even fits in big handbags</li>
    <li> Great organizer for your purse or tote. I bought two of these. I gave one to my daughter to use in her work bag. She loves it. So many compartments and pockets to store your stuff. I also bought one to use in my purses. So convenient to move from purse to purse. I purchases the medium one. I was thinking a larger one might be better for a tote bag. The medium fits perfect in an average size purse.</li>
    <li> Love my SODIAL Handbag Pouch Bag in Bag Organizer Insert. It has so many compartments and pockets to store my stuff. Makes it so easy to switch from one purse to another while allowing you to always find your items.</li>
    <li> Oh my was I impressed with this Purse organiser, so many pockets and the storage room.  I can orgainise my large purse without rummaging though my purse.  Everything has its place.  I can change purses in a quick pull of the little handles without disturbing anything.  I just wish this can in different colors.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I don&#x27;t use it as a purse organizer....I am an avid (or as my DH likes to say...Rabid) Knitter. Always have a knitting project with me. And occasionally it&#x27;s tangled up with a comb or wallet in my purse. (Ooooo bad knitter! BAD!)&lt;br /&gt;So when I spotted this I ordered immediately. Work like a charm...pattern in one pocket, needle sizer in another, extra needle tips &amp; cables securely zipped in a long pocket &amp; the center reserved for the all important Knitting project. And plenty of more pockets for whatever.  Fits neatly inside most of my tote style bags and when the need arises I carry it by itself.  Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m wild about the canary yellow &amp; grey thing but HEY - this thing WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;P.S. great price &amp; fast shipping. Came from Shanghai way faster that I expected.</li>
    <li> fits great and I have it in my bag and holds tons of stuff. Wonderful amount of pockets for organization&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Oh yeah. Because it was like $4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought: &amp;#34;Well, I could buy a few burritos or buy two and this pouch container to hold the two burritos.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And let me say, it was totally worth it. That&#x27;s about all it is good for. I would not have been able to fit 3 burritos in it as it is quite small.</li>
    <li> Very good price,but the drawback is the zipper,very hard to zip,both side  is the same.otherwise I will give it my five stars.</li>
    <li> It is very handy, but I used it one day and some parts were falling off, I had to sew it in a lot of places for it to work as it was supposed to.</li>
    <li> This is a good organizer but it would be better if it had rigid sides.  It squishes down inside the bag.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It was inexpensive and has made my life so much easier. I like to switch my bags up all the time and this keeps me organized and allows me to never leave a staple item behind. It holds everything nicely, I keep staple items in the side pocket; facial tissue, lip balm, lip gloss, Pen, floss, Tylenol, oil blotting sheets, &amp; lotion. The middle compartment is big enough to hold my wallet, sunglass case, keys and planner. My only gripe about this product was that the zippers aren&#x27;t the highest quality but it doesn&#x27;t bother me, i just store things in there i won&#x27;t access often (ex: emergency stash of feminine products). I would definitely recommend this to friends...These would make great Christmas gifts, It&#x27;s one of those products that you don&#x27;t think about buying but is extremely handy.</li>
    <li> I received the purse organizer in about 3 weeks, which coming from Hong Kong, I thought it was going to take much longer. I love the fact that I can now change purses in a matter of minutes. The organizer fits well in my varies purses. I like to change purses often so this is great. The only thing I found wrong was 1 of the zippers does not zip all the way. Works great with my different Couch purses!</li>
    <li> Before I even placed it in my purse, the side pockets had torn.  This item is less than six weeks old and it has already fallen apart!</li>
    <li> Use this every day, holds a lot of stuff</li>
    <li> I gave these to 3 friends for Christmas (in MARCH!) and they were all delighted.  I&#x27;ve used several of these and this one is more suited to larger purses than to clutches.  I love that it has 2 zippered compartments to place c credit cards and cash to make them harder to steal, that it has MANY outside pockets of varying sizes, all of which fit something just perfectly.  It is well constructed and well designed.  Except for the delay in the actual shipping, I could not want anything better. They are great.</li>
    <li> I receive this product with it coming apart at the seams.  Pity too because it had a good desing and lots of storage.</li>
    <li> This little bag is pure genius!  Wish I had thought of it myself. This bag is the epitome of &amp;#34;a place for everything and everything in it&#x27;s place&amp;#34;.  I thought I was organized before I got this bag --- but this bag takes organization to a whole new level.  Now my stuff doesn&#x27;t get all jumbled up inside my bag.  Everything stays where I put it. No more fumbling for the hand cleaner or tissue.  I read reviews that said that this bag is too large for their purse... Well, if that&#x27;s true, then you don&#x27;t carry around enough stuff to need this pouch bag.  Also, for the amount of work that went into this bag, the price is incredible!</li>
    <li> a little bigger than I was thinking, but useful just the same. I was able to get it very fast.</li>
    <li> Nice size, many pockets, no torn sides or zippers, but, one of the zippers closes half-way, still usable. I will get a lot of travel use for a small price.</li>
    <li> But I still love it, I will use it for my school tote bag so it will work. Finally, I can have all the small necessities organized so I don&#x27;t have fish anymore.</li>
    <li> I bought this to put in my beach bag on our most recent cruise and I&#x27;m happy to say it kept everything nice and organized. It is great, especially for the small price tag.</li>
    <li> No closure up top means that you can&#x27;t travel with it or drop it in your gym bag. Would be so much better with a zipper or flap.</li>
    <li> The zippers don&#x27;t work very well.  Very hard to get them closed.  I ordered one before and it was much better than these.</li>
    <li> I received my organizer way before I thought I would get it. I thought I would have to wait a month. I received in 7 business days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the size and all the pockets.  I think it&#x27;s perfect. I definitely recommend this organizer.</li>
    <li> makes it so easy to change purses!!!  @ seconds and you&#x27;re done!!</li>
    <li> It is very convenient and useful.  I can just put my items  on each pockets and put it in my tote bags. When I change my purse or tote bag, I just pull it out and voila, everything I need is there.</li>
    <li> Organiser is fine but the handle broke before I even used it and was not really able to  be repaired.  Makes moving from one handbag to another much easer.</li>
    <li> The first day I got this bag I pull the compartment and it ripped, it is too big for most of my bags..... I was very excited when I received it but it was disappointing once I saw how big it was,  I&#x27;m not using it :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this bag for 3 months and was able to organize and find easily all my essentials.  My fiancé ordered one as well for himself.</li>
    <li> I wasnt sure if I would like this or not but I LOVE it! It&#x27;s the perfect purse organizer, and I will never go without it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this pouch because I think it will resolved my problem for my purse but it&#x27;s too big and it doesn&#x27;t quite fit and the material is really cheap and it&#x27;s already falling apart. I wish it was a little smaller so I don&#x27;t really like it.</li>
    <li> This bag is nice and very good quality. Seriously, you do not need to spend more money in this type of organizers.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it</li>
    <li> I ordered this to use with my Miche purse since the inserts for them are really expensive.  It works perfect.  Highly recommended. Order came in super quick and the price was unbelievably reasonable.</li>
    <li> This product took a while to be delivered (did not see the note that it was shipping from China at first) but when it did come I was completely satisfied. The price was great and the quality seems to be way above what I expected at that price. The product is very light, and has perfect sized pockets. The only things I would say on the negative side is that the smell of it when I first took it out of the packaging was odious, and it did bulk up my handbag a bit because of all the cushioning. I do, however, still think it&#x27;s a good buy and am intending to buy more as gifts.</li>
