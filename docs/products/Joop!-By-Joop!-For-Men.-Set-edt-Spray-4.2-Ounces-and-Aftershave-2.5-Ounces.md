      <li>I highly recommend it and it is a great price for both items.</li>
      <li>Joop is my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite cologne and is quickly becoming mine as well.</li>
      <li>Perhaps the aftershave that I was familiar with is no longer made!</li>
      <li>It was a good deal and fast also.</li>
      <li>The smell is very sweet and strong</li>
      <li>When you spray it on you,the smell is strong.</li>
      <li>(this one has a strong presence, not a scent that goes</li>
      <li>/&gt;the smell is strong and peculiar, but i have been told i wear it</li>
      <li>never found the price this cheap.</li>
      <li>I wondered why he would want something so cheap, now I know.</li>
      <li>Was excited for the price.</li>
      <li>It is the only cologne he uses and with the after shave he loved it</li>
      <li>i placed a very large order and this was the first item i received!!</li>
      <li>I suggest you go out to the mall and try different brands and see which one works the best with your body&#x27;s chemistry, then come back to Amazon</li>
      <li>set includes a bottle with a regular screw off cap for &amp;#34;splashing&amp;#34; and one with a spray top, which I prefer as it release a more evened amount of liquid.</li>
      <li>I love this product and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is manly and exciting and always elicits compliments wherever I go.</li>
      <li>It came quickly and smells exactly like I remembered it.</li>
      <li>people would notice right away.</li>
      <li>It has just the right combination of fragrance and musk.</li>
      <li>I previously brought it for them before, and they loved it.</li>
      <li>I have read many places online that one is enough).  </li>
      <li>This item was delivered on time and it was exactly what it said it would be.</li>
      <li>First use broke my neck out severely within minutes.  </li>
      <li>so i got on here, ordered this for only $40 for more than double the amount plus free after shave.</li>
      <li>Not as fresh as when bought new in stores.</li>
      <li>i like to have a large selection of cologne to choose from, and this is always a favorite.&lt;br</li>
      <li>There wasn&#x27;t much of a smell to it.  </li>
      <li>Really fast shipping as well.</li>
      <li>The after shave and cologne set made it all the better as I also purchased some DE wet shaving equipment for him to try as well.  </li>
      <li>As this is one of his top two favorite colognes, I almost couldn&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
      <li>I have used the Joop brand previously, mainly the aftershave.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this set.</li>
      <li>So I normally wear somewhat of a cheaper scent.</li>
      <li>I live in the UK and this was a gift for my son-in-law who lives in the US.  </li>
      <li>It was new.</li>
      <li>so while at the store me and my girl looked for something new.</li>
      <li>and I know that the one I got from Amazon does not smell as strong and last as long - although this perfume is rated extremely high on longevity and sillage.</li>
      <li>, almost candy-like, which can be too much for those who prefer more delicate smells</li>
      <li>Old spice/</li>
      <li>He was so surprised at the price, given what the department store wanted.</li>

    <li> excellent recomended 100%</li>
    <li> It came quickly and smells exactly like I remembered it. The packaging is really nice too. It would be perfect for a gift.</li>
    <li> Great product love it fast delivery</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my son.  As this is one of his top two favorite colognes, I almost couldn&#x27;t go wrong.  The after shave and cologne set made it all the better as I also purchased some DE wet shaving equipment for him to try as well.  He was very impressed by it all much less topped off with the cologne.  Really fast shipping as well.</li>
    <li> I used to pay up to $60 in a perfume shop for this combination of Joop. The fragrance is manly and exciting and always elicits compliments wherever I go. This is a great deal on a fantastic product!</li>
    <li> Best Cologne i&#x27;ve ever used. i use this since 1994 same effect on Women. now my wife doesnt like other girls turn around when i pass</li>
    <li> smells great she realy loves it thank you</li>
    <li> I ordered this set as a gift. What I got was the small bottle of Joop. If I had enough time I would have sent it back. I paid for a gift set &amp; got a single small bottle. This supplier seems to have a history of doing this. As I just read a review that said the same thing to that person. Why is this supplier still allowed to sell on Amazon?</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my kids as a fathers day present and when he opened the box there was only the small bottle of Joop. I am very disappointed that I did not get what I ordered!!</li>
    <li> I received the product as shown in the picture. Everything was excellent.   It was new. I got it just in time.  I&#x60;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love when my husband wears to this is a great source since it is rarely found in the stores anymore</li>
    <li> It was a Christmas gift but the box a was damaged</li>
    <li> I bought the joop as a present for my partner and he loves it. Thank you !&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m satistfied and so is he so we are appreciate your delivery</li>
    <li> }I like a good product I do not like this written about it while I taste my god both muy bueno tya no quiero escrivir mas</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s joop, but not really a great deal. I can just purchase at local store for same price</li>
    <li> I love this set. My wife and daughter gave me Joop! for my birthday several years ago, and I&#x27;m hooked on this. My favorite after shave and cologne. Will buy again!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this solely due to pricing compared to local sources. This is a great buy for anyone that likes this product and I will reorder as needed</li>
    <li> THIS WAS THE BEST I LOVEED IT  YOU  LOOKED OUT ............ THINK YOU SO MUSH  YOU WAS MY BEST FRIEND LIKE IT</li>
    <li> because the price is right and this is very good stuff. been using this stuff for a long time havn&#x27;t never found the price this cheap.</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s fav and the prices was the best around.  He was so surprised at the price, given what the department store wanted.</li>
    <li> I got conned into ordering this for a friend that was supposed to pay me back.  The fact that he did not is indicative of his character and the quality of this cologne.  I wondered why he would want something so cheap, now I know. It smells like an air wick coupled with mid-life despair.</li>
    <li> i placed a very large order and this was the first item i received!! i love it and he will love it when he opens it for christmas! i will go to purchase more items through this seller.</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with my purchase. I will be more than happy to do business again !!!</li>
    <li> I must say that I love this cologne. But for some reason it doesn&#x27;t last long at all. When you spray it on you,the smell is strong. But after 30 minutes you can&#x27;t smell it anymore. I remember my old bottle of hoop where it&#x27;d stay on me all day and people would notice right away. I don&#x27;t know if its just me or if this bottle is a fake. Its a shame, I like something that&#x27;ll last not only for a few minutes</li>
    <li> It was a good deal and fast also.</li>
    <li> One does not write to tell about Joop. Instead, one wears it and let&#x27;s others whom they encounter talk about Joop.</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised</li>
    <li> My favorite scent on my husband. And what a great price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Excellent price, I can say more, since I know I can not help but have a bottle and now after shave</li>
    <li> After wearing &amp;#34;Polo&amp;#34; by Ralph Lauren for 10 years, I decided it was time for a change.. that&#x27;s when I found Joop!..&lt;br /&gt;That was over 10 years ago!&lt;br /&gt;In that time, I have tried a few other &amp;#34;trendy&amp;#34; colognes, but nothing has gotten a response, from both women &amp; men, like Joop! has.&lt;br /&gt;Women cuddle up close when we meet just to get a sniff of my neck (the girlfriend hates that, but insists I still stick with Joop!) and men constantly ask me what I am wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joop! is a blend of cinnamon, jasmine, honey, tobacco, and vetiver (a perennial grass) scents, a refined &amp; woody smell considered &amp;#34;oriental&amp;#34; in classification.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like any cologne/perfume, it will smell different on each person who tries it. I suggest you go out to the mall and try different brands and see which one works the best with your body&#x27;s chemistry, then come back to Amazon once you know what works best to get the best price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This same set cost almost double at my local department store!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it&lt;br /&gt;The price and product&lt;br /&gt;This was a gift for my dad&lt;br /&gt;He was so happy once he opened his gift ...</li>
    <li> This is hard to find in stores. Not as fresh as when bought new in stores. But, my husband likes it.</li>
    <li> Got this set yesterday and it&#x27;s perfect and definitely genuine and not a fake. one little spray on my clothes is still stuck from last night. I highly recommend this set. the first time I wore Joop was back in the late nineties.</li>
    <li> A great price &amp; product!</li>
    <li> This gift was for my son in law and he loves it, good price.</li>
    <li> Cologne:3 stars&lt;br /&gt;It is sure to be different for everyone, but I usually need two sprays to smell it(though I have read many places online that one is enough).  It lasts about 4 hours before fading, and by 6 hours it is gone.  I get the same results regardless of spraying it on my neck, chest, or wrists.  The smell is nice.  A bottle this size if used every day will last you about 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aftershave:1 star&lt;br /&gt;Just not something I&#x27;ll be using again.  First use broke my neck out severely within minutes.  I took some meds for swelling, and about two days later was normal again.  There wasn&#x27;t much of a smell to it.  I gave it to my father, and he has had a better experience with it than me.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Joop! for Men for a few years now.  My wife loves it, and the scent gets a lot of compliments from others as well.  A quality product and at a great value found here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Did not get what I ordered. I sent back the 1oz. that I received and they refunded the money. It was supposed to be a gift. Was excited for the price. But did not turn out. Just a hassle for nothing.</li>
    <li> great deal for the price.loved it..</li>
    <li> was a gift to my nephew!!! his neice saw the package and love the scent and wanted one for her dad.  will be buying more soon.</li>
    <li> So I normally wear somewhat of a cheaper scent. Old spice/ stetson.&lt;br /&gt;But I was out and so while at the store me and my girl looked for something new. came across this and she fell in love with it, but it was like $50 for a 2oz bottle. yeah screw that. so i got on here, ordered this for only $40 for more than double the amount plus free after shave. no brainer right?&lt;br /&gt;my gal seems to want to cuddle more. so five stars in my book.</li>
    <li> Joop is my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite cologne and is quickly becoming mine as well. I can&#x27;t exactly describe the scent, but I can say it drives me crazy. It has just the right combination of fragrance and musk. I love this product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> this is one of my go-to colognes.  i like to have a large selection of cologne to choose from, and this is always a favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the smell is strong and peculiar, but i have been told i wear it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no issues with packaging or billing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hard to go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> No tengo comentario porque fue excelente el producto Felicitaciones era lo que estaba esperando y el envió también saludos Venezuela</li>
    <li> I have used the Joop brand previously, mainly the aftershave. Perhaps the aftershave that I was familiar with is no longer made! The product I was sent was nothing like I expected. There is very little difference between what they call the aftershave and the Eau de Toilette. A huge disappointment. If Joop no longer makes the type of aftershave I am used to, then I am done with Joop.</li>
    <li> This item was delivered on time and it was exactly what it said it would be. I brought this item as a gift for my husband and he absolutely loved it! I highly recommend it and it is a great price for both items.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS COLOGNE.......and what a deal........last set I bought was from Neiman Marcus......pricey...</li>
    <li> My boyfriend uses it all the time. It is the only cologne he uses and with the after shave he loved it</li>
    <li> Good price for a set. I bought this as a gift for my friend who is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I purchased another of this perfume as a gift to my cousin and I know that the one I got from Amazon does not smell as strong and last as long - although this perfume is rated extremely high on longevity and sillage.</li>
    <li> My husband smells so great when he wears this.  He has gotten lots of compliments when he wears it out in public.  Makes him feel sexy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m buying this for my little brother and for my brother in law. I previously brought it for them before, and they loved it. It smells really good, and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like it okay, the product is nice... the scent just isn&#x27;t my favorite. It&#x27;s a little musty. Not my favorite.</li>
    <li> No recibi el producto que compre.. Claramente hice la comprea de un Joop! Set y me enviaron un perfume Joop! De 1.0 ounce, espero repongan el producto.. Califico totalmente negativo el servicio..</li>
    <li> This is completely a question of taste, as it&#x27;s clearly not for everyone. The smell is very sweet and strong, almost candy-like, which can be too much for those who prefer more delicate smells (this one has a strong presence, not a scent that goes unnoticed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for me this is the favorite men fragrance, for years now. I just learned to use it mildly, otherwise I can accidentally choke poor people who share closed spaces with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set includes a bottle with a regular screw off cap for &amp;#34;splashing&amp;#34; and one with a spray top, which I prefer as it release a more evened amount of liquid. Unfortunately, the spray cap is not removable and is sealed tight to the bottle. I wish I could just open the spray when done, fill it with the liquid in the other bottle and use it again. But I guess that&#x27;s not allowed. Still, great aftershave / cologne with a distinctive smell.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my item and came just un time</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product its his favorite.</li>
    <li> I live in the UK and this was a gift for my son-in-law who lives in the US.  I was only asked for one of the items, but when I saw that I could have 2 in a gift box for very little extra, I chose the gift box.  Being able to buy fom the security of Amazon means I can buy gifts which had they been sent from the UK  customs in the US would probably not have let through!!!!</li>
    <li> A gift for my dad and he love it</li>
