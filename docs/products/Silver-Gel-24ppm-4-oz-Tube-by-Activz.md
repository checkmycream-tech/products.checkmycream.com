      <li>My skin was flaking and breaking out tremendously, but this gel has helped it.</li>
      <li>the seller gave us fast service so that we received the gel very quickly, as we needed.</li>
      <li>but for deep skin repair its not that effective.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>It is not sticky and it dries very quickly as it is absorbed into the skin.  </li>
      <li>Not sure is this stuff works or not, BUT the  CURAD Silver Solutions does work GREAT</li>
      <li>It performed exactly as advertised.  </li>
      <li>Many are made by diluting chemical forms of silver, like silver nitrate, to a desired parts per million,  which is then bottled and sold to the public.</li>
      <li>It really does the trick!  </li>
      <li>Activz natural is one of the purest and gentlest available.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>We use this for nearly all wounds, cuts, scrapes, abrasions, and they heal faster and more complete than with triple antibiotic ointment.</li>
      <li>Thanks for fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Really like the results of this gel.</li>
      <li>the tube is much larger.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Thank you so much.</li>
      <li>Although my acne has not completely gone away, this gel has helped it tremendously; it expedites the healing process and makes my skin feel calm.</li>
      <li>This makes the silver much more stable and bioavailable than other forms of silver.</li>
      <li>This gel does not clog my pores, unlike every other lotion/gel I have tried, and it feels light on my skin.</li>
      <li>I applied it to my face ( adult acne and rosacea ) and my skin was smoother and even by morning!?</li>
      <li>/&gt;Ionic Silver is one of the most common forms of silver liquid found in the supplement industry today.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m busy.</li>
      <li>I use this gel as a moisturizer for my face every morning and the flaking and itching, that I had developed, stopped.</li>
      <li>Before the mainstream discovery and acceptance of antibiotics in the early 1900&#x27;s, silver products were used by doctors.</li>
      <li>For a great deal less, I can order this silver and get the same ( if not better ) results.</li>
      <li>Therefore, supplements made with our silver particles can normally be ingested daily as a dietary supplement without building up in the body.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Although ionic silver products have the smallest particle size, they are often the least stable and can easily fall out of solution.&lt;br</li>
      <li>For long term healing using a high end hand cream then wearing soaked leather gloves while you sleep can not be beat.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Our silver is made by a company that has taken the old technology of colloidal silver and improved it to create the next generation of silver products; Nano-silver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not only that, it also cleared up my adult acne AND it evened out my skin tone.</li>
      <li>Colloidal silver is a broad term for a solution that can contain various concentrations of ionic silver compounds, silver colloids, or silver compounds bound to proteins in water.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Have had trouble with eczema on my hand for years. It would crack and be raw looking awful and causing a risk of infection since I worked as a nurse. I started using this product at night and within a week it was healed and within three weeks you couldn&#x27;t even tell it was ever there. You only need a small dab so the tube lasts forever. Well worth the money. I&#x27;d continue to buy it at any cost.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would give me an antiseptic to use for minor scratches and abrasions. I&#x27;m allergic to Neosporin (it contains bacitracin). I&#x27;d only used one silver solution before, by Curad. This product costs a lot less. Unfortunately, it also does much less. In fact, unlike the Curad product, I saw no beneficial effect at all. If I had more time, I&#x27;d probably do a comparison using both products on loaded petri dishes but meanwhile, I have a rash I&#x27;ve scratched into bleeding and I don&#x27;t want to wait for all that. I&#x27;m busy. I can&#x27;t just quit doing a task to wash my hands every few hours. That&#x27;s why I went looking for an antiseptic! Thumbs-down #2: it left a sticky residue. I felt as if I had to wash my hands after it dried. Inconvenient.</li>
    <li> Great product. Use is on regular basis.</li>
    <li> Colloidal silver is a broad term for a solution that can contain various concentrations of ionic silver compounds, silver colloids, or silver compounds bound to proteins in water. Colloidal silvers have been around for thousands of years and have been used by many ancient civilizations as a means to maintain health. Before the mainstream discovery and acceptance of antibiotics in the early 1900&#x27;s, silver products were used by doctors. These earlier versions of silver products are not to be discounted because they indeed provided countless favorable benefits to those who used them to improve their health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ionic Silver is one of the most common forms of silver liquid found in the supplement industry today. Many are made by diluting chemical forms of silver, like silver nitrate, to a desired parts per million,  which is then bottled and sold to the public. Although ionic silver products have the smallest particle size, they are often the least stable and can easily fall out of solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our silver is made by a company that has taken the old technology of colloidal silver and improved it to create the next generation of silver products; Nano-silver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nano-silver:  A thin multivalent silver oxide coating, built of numerous of Ag404 molecules, surrounds the metallic nano sized silver core. With the Ag404 coating, the silver particle is attracted to the surrounding water molecules, and as such, becomes part of the structure of the water. This makes the silver much more stable and bioavailable than other forms of silver. .Unlike other silver companies that rely on century old technology, when we decided to differentiate ourselves, we actually ended up creating a new molecular structure previously unseen in the world of silver products. Because of this difference, our silver particles have many qualities, qualities that each add up to create a unique silver technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Our silver particles are excreted from the body within 24 hours. Therefore, supplements made with our silver particles can normally be ingested daily as a dietary supplement without building up in the body.&lt;br /&gt;  Our silver particles reach their peak absorption in the blood stream within 2 hours (quick and effective absorption).&lt;br /&gt;  Because of their multiple modes of action, you need less of our nano-silver particles to accomplish the same thing as you would with other ionic or colloidal silver particles (this results in much less silver ingested comparatively).&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00B112APK Silver Gel 24ppm - 4 oz Tube by Activz]]</li>
    <li> I developed really bad adult acne and this gel is the only form of moisturizer that my skin likes. My skin was flaking and breaking out tremendously, but this gel has helped it. I use this gel as a moisturizer for my face every morning and the flaking and itching, that I had developed, stopped. Although my acne has not completely gone away, this gel has helped it tremendously; it expedites the healing process and makes my skin feel calm. It has given me a lot of relief and I no longer desire to scratch my face all day long. My skin also looks healthier and it feels smoother. This gel does not clog my pores, unlike every other lotion/gel I have tried, and it feels light on my skin.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT....keep at all time with you...even on the road.. in your purse etc... Use like an antibiotic!</li>
    <li> What a huge disappointment... I don&#x27;t usually get suckered into using a product via marketing. We never purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I have no problem with the gel.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I had small facial warts on my face. I had read that it worked for stubborn warts, so I decided to give it a try. It WORKED!!! Not only that, it also cleared up my adult acne AND it evened out my skin tone. I use to always have pink cheaks, now they are gone!!! I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> My dog had a horrible rash on her belly. I put Silver gel on it and put Silver Solution in her water. The rash was gone within 4 days. It&#x27;s been about three weeks and the rash has not returned. My dog has had a history of different rash issues and each cost me about $400 at the vet. This time it was just the cost of these two items.</li>
    <li> Silver is not as strong as I would like it to be.</li>
    <li> Thank you for this amazing product.  It really does the trick!  I am very satisfied with this product.  Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and excellent price. The best product for all your external ailments including toenail fungus</li>
    <li> This is amazing.  works on burns, cuts and for women it works on yeast infections.  Love it.</li>
    <li> My aunt let my wife use some silver while visiting her.  We ran out of the tube she gave us, so I&#x27;m replacing her tube.</li>
    <li> It performed exactly as advertised.  It is not sticky and it dries very quickly as it is absorbed into the skin.  It cleared of a rash within two days. I have already recommended it to a couple people.</li>
    <li> Not sure is this stuff works or not, BUT the  CURAD Silver Solutions does work GREAT so figured I&#x27;d try this&lt;br /&gt;since the tube is much larger.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the ASAP Silver ointment too and compared this Actiz product to ASAP  and it is the SAME.&lt;br /&gt;All 3 patent #&#x27;s and packaging is the identical and even the LOT  #  were within a few digits of each other.&lt;br /&gt;Looks  like ASAP is  private labeling this product for ACTIVZ.</li>
    <li> If you have diabetic ulcers I strongly recommend you use this product on them .</li>
    <li> Best anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal over-the-counter product of its kind. Research-based defense, even against MRSA, SARS, and more.  Price is incomparable to any prescription. Every day to emergencies. Internal and external use from A to Z!</li>
    <li> Has dramatically reduced my acne! Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Not greasy no odor makes your hands feel better fast anti bacterial that&#x27;s the good  but for deep skin repair its not that effective. For long term healing using a high end hand cream then wearing soaked leather gloves while you sleep can not be beat.</li>
    <li> This silver gel is excellent for healing burns etc. Use it on anything. You can even eat it. It will not harm you.</li>
    <li> The best way to promote natural healing</li>
    <li> This is a true miracle!! Would not be without it!</li>
    <li> Great stuff.... excellent delivery. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Need the product to combat excessive dryness.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading about silver colloids and decided to try it ... I am not disappointed! I applied it to my face ( adult acne and rosacea ) and my skin was smoother and even by morning!? I was amazed! A company in Japan incorporates silver in some of their beauty regimens and the prices are astronomical- to say the least- for 1oz bottles. For a great deal less, I can order this silver and get the same ( if not better ) results. I am reordering to give away to family members! BTW, not all silvers are created equal... Activz natural is one of the purest and gentlest available. I researched the company prior to my purchases.</li>
    <li> I cut my hand to the bone and&lt;br /&gt;Silver Gel healed my hand 10 days . it will heal cuts and burns in half the time</li>
    <li> Worked well for blemishes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I had breast cancer. And this gel was just magic for my skin.</li>
    <li> this is a cutting-edge fabulous product my wife and i (and now her sister&#x27;s family as well) wouldn&#x27;t be without. the seller gave us fast service so that we received the gel very quickly, as we needed. it&#x27;s working very well on healing and erasing my wife&#x27;s allergy bumps and scars (her poor face, throat and body broke out badly when a hospital gave her acetaminophen which she&#x27;s allergic to) which nothing else was helping with, and it even works on kitty cats&#x27; fight wounds. great product, definitely NOT your grandmother&#x27;s colloidal silver. we will always be using this silver gel.</li>
    <li> We use this for nearly all wounds, cuts, scrapes, abrasions, and they heal faster and more complete than with triple antibiotic ointment.</li>
    <li> Really like the results of this gel.</li>
    <li> Great product shipped fast</li>
    <li> great product and service</li>
    <li> I think I am just one of those people that this does not work on.  Was not impressed.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to everyone. Its works great. Thanks for fast shipping!</li>
