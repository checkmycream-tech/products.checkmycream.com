      <li>Wonderful smell!</li>

      <li>The cologne smells good, and women did compliment me on it.</li>

      <li>When I wore this I was getting comments four to five times a day on how nice I smelled.</li>
      <li>We both liked the smell as well.</li>
      <li>Reminds me of a cologne I bought in Acapulco two years ago,  Bought it as a lark, liked the Label, but , I like the cologne now, as well.  </li>

      <li>Makes a great gag gift ;-)</li>
      <li>Smells super good, I get compliments on it all the time from it.</li>
      <li>More of a gag gift.</li>
      <li>Surely discussing which one wanted to bang me the most.</li>
      <li>The top loosened and just leaked all over my hand and</li>
      <li>Would love to try a reformulated version of the product.</li>
      <li>There are better products out</li>
      <li>their that smell a lot better with a much better name.</li>
      <li>It smells surprisingly nice, unlike most cheap colognes.</li>
      <li>As a cologne it&#x27;s okay, but your buying it for the name on the box.&lt;br</li>
      <li>in my arsenal, I&#x27;m sure to get, well...</li>
      <li>But by no means has she thrown herself at me sexually.</li>
      <li>would recommend this to anyone who wants to smell great and who wouldn&#x27;t get offended by the name.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff not even gonna talk it up.</li>
      <li>Well, that&#x27;s how women act around a man wearing Sure F</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really guarentee on this colognes&#x27; claim to seduce women, but it does have a very nice scent to it.</li>
      <li>so thanks a lot for screwing this up!!!!</li>
      <li>I originally bought this as a gag gift but after wearing this out on 100 nights out i can confirm that i have got laid 96 times and had a nice hand shandy from another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was kind of surprised to discover this smelled as good as it did.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re looking for a pretty good scene for cheap, this is for you.</li>
      <li>&quot; I do appreciate the FREE Sure F*</li>
      <li>For the most part, he was right, but my dad also didn&#x27;t have Sure F</li>
      <li>was surprised how good it smelled.</li>
      <li>first time I wore Sure F</li>
      <li>I do not like most colognes, but this one is light and has a jasmine tone almost like Acqua di Gio that is clean, refreshing and completely wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Clean smelling , every women I asked to smell</li>
      <li>It really does have a nice, fresh scent and now too powerful.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;d have to say the product is true to its name.</li>
      <li>The cool, fresh and manly aroma is not at all overpowering.</li>
      <li>I thought it smelled nice enough</li>
      <li>The name of the cologne made me laugh, so I purchased it for my husband as a gag gift for Valentine&#x27;s Day.</li>
      <li>The smell is not super strong or musky like most cologne!</li>
      <li>I suppose everyone needs one, right?</li>
      <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expecting it to smell all that great (maybe like sex?); I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as a gift for your priest or pastor, but would definitely recommend it for any friends you might have who frequent the strip clubs.  </li>
      <li>I have no legitimate reason for recommending it other than the name is kind of funny, however, if you plan on using this cologne to actually increase your chance of success with the ladies, stick with the Acqua di Gio; it smells better.  </li>
      <li>This product does exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>I bought this just thinking it would be funny to try.</li>
      <li>plus its funny telling people when they ask what cologne it is.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hardly the world&#x27;s most f***able man, but with a bottle of Sure F</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s no secret that a woman&#x27;s olfactory perception is heightened by certain smells.</li>
      <li>A very fumny gift.</li>
      <li>Reasonably priced, cheaper than a plane to Acapulco, too.</li>
      <li>Thanks for shipping so fast.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and enticing.</li>
      <li>haha.</li>
      <li>Needs a little more kick.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>It makes girls go wild,</li>
      <li>*** out in the wild, I applied a liberal coating -- upstairs and downstairs...</li>
      <li>A classy touch.</li>
      <li>*** even weeks later -- no matter how many times you wash the shirt -- so that girl will never forgot your name the next time she&#x27;s in the mood to get down.</li>
      <li>This is not really the world&#x27;s greatest smelling cologne or anything, but overall it is not too bad.</li>
      <li>One star because of someone screwing up the address by not putting the recipients name on it, only the major corporation&#x27;s name on it..</li>

    <li> I bought this just thinking it would be funny to try. I thought it smelled nice enough so I wore it to work one day. I work with mostly women and almost EVERY one of them told me that I smelled amazing. I wear cologne daily (stuff from Lacoste and Burberry) and would get a comment every once in a while. When I wore this I was getting comments four to five times a day on how nice I smelled. It was hysterical. I let a few of my coworkers in on what I was wearing and they thought it was the funniest thing that it actually appeared to &#x27;attract&#x27; women.</li>
    <li> This is not really the world&#x27;s greatest smelling cologne or anything, but overall it is not too bad. More of a gag gift.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a laugh and it has a surprisingly delightful scent.

Still, this cologne emanates a somewhat pleasant odor.  Was there anything on the product description that says it is not sure?  In case anyone plans to sue for false advertising.  Oh well.  I like it just the same.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell! The smell is not super strong or musky like most cologne! Definitely would recommend this! Great gift idea!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells like ladies purfume. It has nothing appealing and actually made me sick when using. There are better products out their that smell a lot better with a much better name. The last thing you want is your family or date to see this bottle</li>
    <li> Smells super good, I get compliments on it all the time from it. plus its funny telling people when they ask what cologne it is. Excellent cologne for the price.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t order it and ticked off it came to my house!</li>
    <li> Bought a bottle for my boyfriend. Thanks for shipping so fast. I bought it as a gag gift but when I smelled the cologne I loved it.</li>
    <li> Wow! What can i say? This product does exactly as advertised. I originally bought this as a gag gift but after wearing this out on 100 nights out i can confirm that i have got laid 96 times and had a nice hand shandy from another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing! It makes girls go wild, almost primal. I would not recommend wearing this product around family members as this cologne does not discriminate! Most awkward Christmas dinner ever...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really guarentee on this colognes&#x27; claim to seduce women, but it does have a very nice scent to it. My wife loves when I wear it to bed for her to smell whilst we cuddle. But by no means has she thrown herself at me sexually. - nor any other women actually.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a pretty good scene for cheap, this is for you.</li>
    <li> Growing up, my dad always told me that there are no sure things in life. For the most part, he was right, but my dad also didn&#x27;t have Sure F*** cologne when he was my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s no secret that a woman&#x27;s olfactory perception is heightened by certain smells. Have you ever seen a chick when she gets a whiff of chocolate? It&#x27;s like a pack of hyenas circling a wounded zebra. Well, that&#x27;s how women act around a man wearing Sure F*** cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And by \\&quot;a man\\&quot; I mean me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, I went out to the clubs armed with nothing but hair gel and self-tanner lotion, but it wasn&#x27;t enough. After numerous failed attempts with other colognes, I finally settled on Sure F*** after a recommendation from a coworker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I wore Sure F*** out in the wild, I applied a liberal coating -- upstairs and downstairs... if you know what I mean. I couldn&#x27;t keep track of all the compliments I was getting from the ladies on the dance floor. Like: \\&quot;Are you wearing cologne?\\&quot; and \\&quot;Are you the guy wearing all that cologne?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Woah! Settle down, ladies, there&#x27;s plenty of chatchi to go around!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was INSANE! The chicks were surrounding me -- pointing and whispering to their friends. Surely discussing which one wanted to bang me the most. The cool, fresh and manly aroma is not at all overpowering. The best part is when you give a girl your shirt to wear, it&#x27;s guaranteed to smell like Sure F*** even weeks later -- no matter how many times you wash the shirt -- so that girl will never forgot your name the next time she&#x27;s in the mood to get down. It&#x27;s the perfect bouquet to ensure that the ladies are handing their numbers (and their panties) over to you, and not some clown wearing Drakkar Noir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe me when I say that this stuff is like testosterone in a bottle. I&#x27;m hardly the world&#x27;s most f***able man, but with a bottle of Sure F*** in my arsenal, I&#x27;m sure to get, well... f***ed any day now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. While I&#x27;m not what you&#x27;d call a \\&quot;condom-wearer,\\&quot; I do appreciate the FREE Sure F*** condom that came with my order. A classy touch.</li>
    <li> Considering I gave this to my bf for Valentine&#x27;s day and he did wear it out that night, I&#x27;d have to say the product is true to its name. haha. We both liked the smell as well. It smells surprisingly nice, unlike most cheap colognes. Makes a great gag gift ;-)</li>
    <li> A really good cologne....of course the&lt;br /&gt;claims are somewhat suspect.  I recommend&lt;br /&gt;SF Cologne for every event in your life.</li>
    <li> The only reason why I gave this product 3 stars is that it does actually smell good.&lt;br /&gt;It does not work on attracting women or make them feel the need to sleep with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging ( I mean bottle itself) The top loosened and just leaked all over my hand and clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I am being gereous giving it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> The cologne smells good, and women did compliment me on it. But that was only once I had them in bed already. It&#x27;s not very strong and the scent doesn&#x27;t stay with you as long as I would like.</li>
    <li> Great smelling. Fast shipping and enticing. the smell fades over times. Needs a little more kick. Would love to try a reformulated version of the product.</li>
    <li> The name of the cologne made me laugh, so I purchased it for my husband as a gag gift for Valentine&#x27;s Day. I had no idea how great it would smell. I do not like most colognes, but this one is light and has a jasmine tone almost like Acqua di Gio that is clean, refreshing and completely wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who wants to smell great and who wouldn&#x27;t get offended by the name.</li>
    <li> A very fumny gift. As a cologne it&#x27;s okay, but your buying it for the name on the box.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY TO GET YOURSELF LAID! That&#x27;s what charm is for.</li>
    <li> Smells great. But does not attract the female sex or your wife who has lost her libido. No love potion #9, at least not as advertised...;)</li>
    <li> I love this stuff not even gonna talk it up. Just buy it and find out! for yourself how good it is!!!!!</li>
    <li> 60 percent of the time, it works everytime...</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant about trying this Cologne. I&#x27;m usually a bit sensitive and even the slightest bit caused me to contract a headache. Surprisingly, that wasn&#x27;t the case with this. It really does have a nice, fresh scent and now too powerful.</li>
    <li> I was kind of surprised to discover this smelled as good as it did. I suppose everyone needs one, right?</li>
    <li> Bought as a gag gift for my husband for our anniversary.  He loved the name &amp; I was surprised how good it smelled. BTY it lived up to its name that night! lol.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this cologne on me. Every time I wear it she cant keep her hands off me. She won&#x27;t let me wear this cologne when I somewhere without her because she thinks women will be all over me. Lol</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get laid, still smelled good though.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a goof but it smells great and I do believe the product lives up to its name.</li>
    <li> Clean smelling , every women I asked to smell it said it was nice! They aren&#x27;t throwing themselves at me but</li>
    <li> Absolute crap. Wasted money...just scented alcohol. Not even worth the bottle it came in...just pure crap. Never again will I waste my money.</li>
</ol>
