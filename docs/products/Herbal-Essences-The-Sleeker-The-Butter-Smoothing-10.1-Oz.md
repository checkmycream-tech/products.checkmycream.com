<li> I don&#x27;t use heat on my hair or anything, so it is healthy, but this shampoo left me with a bad texture.&lt;br</li>
<li> Made my hair feel dry and looking lackluster.</li>
<li> I cut my hair short recently and was having trouble with it fluffing it up.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s formula&#x27;s changing or what is going on, but my regular shampoo wasn&#x27;t working as well.  </li>
<li> Little antennas all over my head.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo, along with the matching conditioner, for a few months now</li>
<li> As another reviewer mentioned I really hope the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t change the formula or discontinue this line, because once you find personal care products that work I hate it when you can no longer get them!</li>

    <li> Shampoo... lol Not much to say. :)</li>
    <li> works and smells great</li>
    <li> It was cheap, fast delivery and I didn&#x27;t even have to leave the house to pick up some shampoo. Well...had to walk to do the door of course.</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel dry and looking lackluster. Won&#x27;t be using again</li>
    <li> For a guy, one of the things I look for  in hair products along with doing what is says for your hair is a nice soothing smell that is tailored to be A-sexual and this definitely fits that category. As another reviewer mentioned I really hope the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t change the formula or discontinue this line, because once you find personal care products that work I hate it when you can no longer get them!</li>
    <li> I cut my hair short recently and was having trouble with it fluffing it up. This shampoo/conditioner combo has left my hair sleek and soft without looking greasy or weighed down. It smells great too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo, along with the matching conditioner, for a few months now and I really love it! My hair is softer, fuller, and looks great! The smell is great too!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used, actually does what it claims to do and smells great too. I have to buy it online now because the local stores don&#x27;t carry the brown bottle for some reason anymore. Regardless, I hope they never stop making it and will be very upset if they do!</li>
    <li> I admit I have no associations with Herbal Essences and I&#x27;m just a regular customer reviewing this product. The shampoo and conditioner are amazing and smells great! I&#x27;ve got very long hair and this product makes my hair look even shinier and softer than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair. My plea goes out to Herbal Essences for this product---PLEASE DON&#x27;T EVER CHANGE THE FORMULA OR STOP MAKING THIS PRODUCT! You don&#x27;t know how aggravating it is to use/like something and the company ends up changing something or they discontinue the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I did not like the way it made my hair feel.</li>
    <li> I felt I was losing my battle against shampoos that left my hair coarse. I bought just this shampoo cuz I had a coupon and I had never seen this brown bottle so.., why not try!! Im in love!! As soon as I lather, my hair feels so soft as if I applied conditioner. I even double checked assuming I had bought a conditioner instead.., but no..,  it was a shampoo. I cant wait to tru it on my daughter&#x27;s unruly wavy hair. It&#x27;ll help her so much!!! My hair feels soft, lustrous and manageable!!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> I used this along with the Butter conditioner. It did nothing for my frizzy hair. It smells great and looks great, but it didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
    <li> My kids love this conditioner. Smell great and make their hair shiny.</li>
    <li> i smell like a cookie! I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Just finished washing  with this product and my hair is twice as frizzy as normal. Little antennas all over my head. Seems like they messed up the formula.</li>
    <li> It does seem to make my hair softer and has a nice scent.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair smooth nice smell.</li>
    <li> The only reason I gave this four stars and not five is that it took me a while to get used to my hair smelling like this.</li>
    <li> My daughter has frizzy hair and we&#x27;ve noticed a difference using this shampoo. Not greasy, but leaves hair moisturized and helps with the frizzies. We also bought the conditioner, and the pair well together. Definitely buying again.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best Shampoos I have tried in a long time. It makes my hair so soft and silky that I don&#x27;t even need to use conditioner with it. I love it and plan on buying more. I definitely recommend this Shampoo especially if your hair is dry or damaged.</li>
    <li> NIce scent, leave hair smooth!</li>
    <li> Smells good! Hubby &amp; kids use it ! Worth the $$</li>
    <li> It smells nice, kind of like cocoa butter, but it makes my hair feel sticky and stiff. It also made my hair frizzy. I&#x27;ve used another Herbal Essences shampoo and did not have these problems. It also lathers strangely.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS SHAMPOO!!  It has been awhile since I have found a shampoo worth buying more than once.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s formula&#x27;s changing or what is going on, but my regular shampoo wasn&#x27;t working as well.  This shampoo makes your hair so soft and shiny and I love the smell!  Will continue to purchase this!!</li>
    <li> It has SLS, which strips oil out of your hair, but it also left mine dry and felt more brittle than when I used Dove shampoo. I don&#x27;t use heat on my hair or anything, so it is healthy, but this shampoo left me with a bad texture.&lt;br /&gt;It made my hair smell good though. Lol</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!! It smells amazing!</li>
    <li> This was my first time using Herbal Essences Shampoo and let me start by saying, the smell alone is amazing! After using, my hair was so soft and shiny. I just cant believe I haven&#x27;t tried this sooner!  My hair has never felt so healthy. This is a great product and I will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
