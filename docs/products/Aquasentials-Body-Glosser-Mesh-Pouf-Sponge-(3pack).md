      <li>lol</li>
      <li>The best mesh pouf I&#x27;ve ever used, and there have been many over the years.  </li>
      <li>They also don&#x27;t seem to hold soap lather like the good ones.</li>
      <li>This mesh sponge is a good replacement for the discontinued Bath and Body Works sponge that I loved.  </li>
      <li>good item.</li>
      <li>good stuff.</li>
      <li>You can get a good scrub in these</li>
      <li>Very pleased with them and would order again.</li>
      <li>Nice assortment of colors</li>
      <li>These poufs are large and very good quality.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad that i was able to find them on this site</li>
      <li>Next best thing since Bath and Body Works d/c theirs.  </li>
      <li>I was very excited when I received my bath sponges in the mail from Aquabella but that excitement sorta changed ocne</li>
      <li>you don&#x27;t like the looser, softer type of mesh sponge that you can get from most places these days, these may fit the bill.  </li>
      <li>I will update it a few weeks and let you know if it is still GREAT!</li>
      <li>The search goes on for poufs of the good old days...</li>
      <li>price is right for sure.  </li>
      <li>i sure hope they come back in stock :)</li>
      <li>worth the money</li>
      <li>Glosser Mesh Pouf Sponges worth the money.  </li>
      <li>Not a big deal for most people but worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true, as many say, that good, long-lasting, properly sized poufs are hard to come by these days.</li>
      <li>but these are the closest I have been able to find in several years of searching.  </li>
      <li>I read the reviews about this product, and I agree that these poufs are bigger than a baby&#x27;s fist --which is the size of many versions of this product.</li>
      <li>Within the first week one side of the pouf has already come apart.</li>
      <li>I recall a year ago when we could get five in a clear plastic cylinder for cheap at Walgreen&#x27;s or a slightly higher price at Whole Foods.</li>
      <li>One day I will find a large one</li>
      <li>Their sponges were very durable.</li>
      <li>I really like these exfoliating shower poufs.</li>
      <li>Soooooo much nicer than the ones from the bins in the grocery store.</li>
      <li>Slightly smaller than the previous ones I&#x27;ve gotten from the store, but still good.</li>
      <li>I too was looking for a replacement for the Bath &amp; Body mesh sponge since they went to their new softer version &amp; stopped selling this style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has been 3 YEARS since this product was last available through Amazon (can&#x27;t find it anywhere else), but thankfully my back-up stash still has one left in it.  </li>
      <li>but they are not round like a ball</li>
      <li>If you enjoy a harsh skin scrubbing, where you look and feel like a boiled lobster after &amp;#34;glossing&amp;#34; your body, then go ahead and buy these.  </li>
      <li>The product is largely the same, but as with my last order (April 2011), they are now using a silky polyester ribbon as a hanger instead of the polyester rope.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;While I agree with M. Wilks&#x27; review that these sponges don&#x27;t stay together nearly as long as the old B&amp;BW versions, theirs used to cost $6 each *on sale* making these Aquabella Body</li>
      <li>These are very close to the ones formerly sold at B&amp;BW, but just a little smaller.  </li>

<li> Maybe it&#x27;s a new thing due to manufacturing changes, but these can take the skin off your arm!</li>
<li> but flat like a flying saucer.</li>
<li> Just know that this sponge might no last as long as you would like.</li>
<li> it lasts a long while.</li>
<li> It is quite a bit smaller than I expected</li>
<li> It did take a long time to receive them.</li>
<li> &quot; thick, which is about right for the average hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> some customer&#x27;s complain about that they get loose</li>
<li> These mesh sponges are full-bodied &amp; substantial.  </li>
<li> They measure about 5\\&quot; wide by 3\\</li>
<li> These are NOT LARGE AT ALL...</li>
<li> But they are still small compared to the larger ones I used to find.</li>
<li> And there is another problem with these: the plastic is very rough.</li>
<li> (DO NOT USE THE THICK ONES GET THE SMALL ONES) and i promise you that they will last, put them in the middle where the cord is wrapped around the sponge and put them tight</li>
<li> My skin is not sensitive in the least, but I couldn&#x27;t handle these poufs at all.  </li>
<li> Too small rough on skin</li>
<li> A few weeks if I recall correctly.</li>
<li> I have gotten a few months of use out of each before they loosen up too much.&lt;br</li>
<li> I appreciate that it&#x27;s not too fluffy like others tend to be.</li>
<li> /&gt;Simply put, no these aren&#x27;t as durable as the similar-style Mesh pouf/sponge that Bath &amp; Body Works used to sell individually (and still do in their expensive sets)...  </li>

    <li> Nice assortment of colors</li>
    <li> I give these sponges a 5 stars because they are the best.I&#x27;m so glad that i was able to find them on this site some customer&#x27;s complain about that they get loose WELL HERE IS A TIP AND THAT WHAT I DO I GET A PLASTIC TIE-WRAP THE ONES YOU USE TO GATHER CABLES  THEY WORK GREAT (DO NOT USE THE THICK ONES GET THE SMALL ONES) and i promise you that they will last, put them in the middle where the cord is wrapped around the sponge and put them tight</li>
    <li> Great feel and colors.  Saves on soap</li>
    <li> I was very excited when I received my bath sponges in the mail from Aquabella but that excitement sorta changed ocne I started using the body glosser mesh pouf sponge. Within the first week one side of the pouf has already come apart. I use to buy these type of pouf sponges from Bath and Body but they stop selling them. Their sponges were very durable.Just know that this sponge might no last as long as you would like.</li>
    <li> Too small rough on skin</li>
    <li> Slightly smaller than the previous ones I&#x27;ve gotten from the store, but still good. It did take a long time to receive them. A few weeks if I recall correctly.</li>
    <li> This mesh sponge is a good replacement for the discontinued Bath and Body Works sponge that I loved.  Can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
    <li> great quality shower pouf!! just like the ones bbw use to sell. i sure hope they come back in stock :)</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Durable (I&#x27;ve found that the individual mesh sponges lasted about four to five months each.  The three pack lasted me a total of 14-months)&lt;br /&gt;- Low cost&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTABLE:&lt;br /&gt;- The rope-tie in the picture is now just a ribbon.  Not a big deal for most people but worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, no these aren&#x27;t as durable as the similar-style Mesh pouf/sponge that Bath &amp; Body Works used to sell individually (and still do in their expensive sets)...  But they don&#x27;t fall apart overnight either and they cost a fraction of the price!  Shower poufs/sponges are supposed to be changed out every three-months anyway...</li>
    <li> These are NOT LARGE AT ALL... Same size as the rest of them. One day I will find a large one</li>
    <li> great product. it lasts a long while. it also the suds very good. good stuff. good item. worth the money</li>
    <li> I use these to wash the dog with..she loves them too! lol</li>
    <li> I too was looking for a replacement for the Bath &amp; Body mesh sponge since they went to their new softer version &amp; stopped selling this style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I agree with M. Wilks&#x27; review that these sponges don&#x27;t stay together nearly as long as the old B&amp;BW versions, theirs used to cost $6 each *on sale* making these Aquabella Body Glosser Mesh Pouf Sponges worth the money.  These mesh sponges are full-bodied &amp; substantial.  They measure about 5\\&quot; wide by 3\\&quot; thick, which is about right for the average hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like the looser, softer type of mesh sponge that you can get from most places these days, these may fit the bill.  I have gotten a few months of use out of each before they loosen up too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is right for sure.  Happy suds to you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- UPDATED REVIEW - July 21, 2014 --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been 3 YEARS since this product was last available through Amazon (can&#x27;t find it anywhere else), but thankfully my back-up stash still has one left in it.  Just saw this pop up on my suggested items list, so I ordered another six.  The product is largely the same, but as with my last order (April 2011), they are now using a silky polyester ribbon as a hanger instead of the polyester rope.  The ribbon has come untied due to the ribbon&#x27;s silkiness mixed with soap, but I&#x27;ve just retied it as needed - the zip-tie that holds the pouf together in the middle is still the same, and that has only failed once in my many years of using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
    <li> I appreciate that it&#x27;s not too fluffy like others tend to be. You can get a good scrub in these but it&#x27;s not abrasive. It is quite a bit smaller than I expected but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Next best thing since Bath and Body Works d/c theirs.  Yes, theirs was the BEST but these are the closest I have been able to find in several years of searching.  I have been using the same one for about 2 weeks now and it is totally intact.  I shower several times a day and could not be happier, at this point.  I will update it a few weeks and let you know if it is still GREAT!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s true, as many say, that good, long-lasting, properly sized poufs are hard to come by these days. I recall a year ago when we could get five in a clear plastic cylinder for cheap at Walgreen&#x27;s or a slightly higher price at Whole Foods. I read the reviews about this product, and I agree that these poufs are bigger than a baby&#x27;s fist --which is the size of many versions of this product. But they are still small compared to the larger ones I used to find. And there is another problem with these: the plastic is very rough. Maybe it&#x27;s a new thing due to manufacturing changes, but these can take the skin off your arm! They also don&#x27;t seem to hold soap lather like the good ones. The search goes on for poufs of the good old days...</li>
    <li> The best mesh pouf I&#x27;ve ever used, and there have been many over the years.  I will definitely order these again and again.</li>
    <li> These poufs are large and very good quality. I would order again.</li>
    <li> These are very close to the ones formerly sold at B&amp;BW, but just a little smaller.  Very pleased with them and would order again.</li>
    <li> I really like these exfoliating shower poufs. They are course, so they exfoliate well.</li>
    <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t read that it was assorted colors. I thought I was ordering purple. I wanted purple. Not one of them was purple. Also, there is a ribbon tie instead of a rope tie. I haven&#x27;t used them and am thinking of returning because this wasn&#x27;t what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I find these to be the best kind of body sponges. Arrived in a timely fashion as advertised.</li>
    <li> No way.  These poufs are not even close to what Bath &amp; Body Works used to sell.  If you&#x27;re thinking about buying these, go to your garage, grab a hunk of steel wool and scrub with that.  If you enjoy a harsh skin scrubbing, where you look and feel like a boiled lobster after &amp;#34;glossing&amp;#34; your body, then go ahead and buy these.  My skin is not sensitive in the least, but I couldn&#x27;t handle these poufs at all.  I gave them to the dog and let him shred them before they went into the garbage.  Ouch!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it looked big and the dimensions said 5-5 1/2  but they are not round like a ball but flat like a flying saucer. The pic is correct but I wised they gave a side view so people can not expect a ball shaped POUF but a bagel shaped one.</li>
    <li> Soooooo much nicer than the ones from the bins in the grocery store.</li>
