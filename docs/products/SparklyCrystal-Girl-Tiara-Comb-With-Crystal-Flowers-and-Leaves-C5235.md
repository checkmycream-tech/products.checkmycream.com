    <li> This was absolutely beautiful!! Its exactly what I wanted and it went perfectly with my veil! This is something I&#x27;ll be able to pass onto my daughter when she gets married!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my niece to where on our wedding day, it is simply beautiful. Looks more expensive then ehat we paid.</li>
    <li> This is gorgeous!  Got it as a gift and discovered the absolutely best gift anyone can give a little girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will fuel hours of fantasy and dress up fun!</li>
    <li> This tiara is just adorable- made well and very sparkly. I read the previous reviews and they are correct, this hairpiece is not for a \\&quot;girl\\&quot; its for a larger head, a womans. I am 24 and got it for my updo. Overall, I&#x27;d say I was satisfied!</li>
    <li> well made for the price for sure, but much smaller than the pictures would make you think.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the wife on a whim and she loved it. It&#x27;s very cute when worn and looks amazing. It stays put in the hair all day with no problems. Our only concern is the metal is kind of thin and as a result, this Tiara can be easily bent.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my 7 year old&#x27;s 1st Communion.  It was the perfect size and it arrived super fast!    Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> Was broken upon arrival. I didn&#x27;t have time to replace it either. Wedding was in three days. It arrived late. It is pretty, just wish I could have worn it for my wedding.</li>
    <li> Although a very beautiful tiara, it was received in two pieces, tiara was detached from the comb! Very upset!</li>
    <li> This product arrived and was a pretty as the picture.  It is the perfect touch of glam for your special day.</li>
    <li> Going to need some teasing and wrapping and heaps of hairspray to get this to stay and stand upright, it&#x27;s heavyweight and will flop over if you simply slide the comb in. Very pretty!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting married in August of 2009 and was searching for a tiara.  I found one at my bridal store but they wanted $90 for it. I was very impressed with this one when I received it.  I was unsure when I ordered it because I didn&#x27;t know if it was going to be big enough for me since it&#x27;s labeled as a flower girl tiara.  To my delight it is perfect and just what I was looking for.  For those out there searching this is a keeper.  However, I don&#x27;t recommend it for a flower girl.</li>
    <li> Was worn with pride. Well made.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so pretty! I&#x27;m am adult and love it for my Cinderella cosplay. You&#x27;ll need something to hold it in place though.</li>
    <li> The tiaras are very pretty and seem to be of quality materials. The only complaint I have is that they were advertised as flower girl tiaras. My flower girls are seven and eight and these tiaras are large enough to fit my head. When I e-mailed the seller, it took awhile for him to respond and he said that I could return them, however, at this point it&#x27;s not worth the shipping.</li>
    <li> Great tiara comb for any occasion, not only a wedding!  Very expensive looking for the price.  I would recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wedding. It looked really nice.</li>
    <li> Very pretty, good quality but did not sit flat on my head. no hastle return</li>
    <li> the item came to me in a timely manner. it also came well protected with bubble wrap when it was shipped to me.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved this, it is exactly what she wanted for her First Holy Communion. It is just sparkly enough without being overwhelming, and the size is perfect. This tiara definitely works best with an updo hairstyle.</li>
    <li> For my wedding attendants. the 1 who saw them was wow-ing and impressed that it matched the jewelry sets I had chosen for them. I am going for a sparkley &#x27;understated&#x27; sort of look. And this went so very well with it  will be amazing at the wedding. You shant be disappointed if you go with these.</li>
    <li> I found this to be a really great product. I would definitely recommend it to others, a very happy purchase.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful but the comb is not practical for thin hair. Plan on using Bobbie pins. Doesn&#x27;t seem like it is good for down hairstyles. I&#x27;m returning it for something better.</li>
    <li> This product has a weird gap in-between the design and the comb, so it doesn&#x27;t lay flat. It&#x27;s also a weird length. It would make more sense if it was a clip and not a comb</li>
    <li> the tiara is very cute I loved it, it completely filled my expectations, size is very good and it fits perfectly!</li>
    <li> Really pretty. Great comb!!</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because of the price and quality of this tiara. I purchased it for my wedding and it look beautiful with the updo I plan to do. It looks very pretty and of good quality.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these for my flower girls and was very pleased. The comb made it easy for the girls to keep it on. One of my flower girls even wore it in another wedding she was in.</li>
    <li> The tiara was pretty...but entirely too large for a flower girl.  It is sized for a woman not a child.</li>
    <li> Although beautiful, this tiara is not made for a flower girl.  Once I received it I had my MOH put the tiara on her head (she is a rather petite, but fully grown woman) and the tiara was much to big for her!  There&#x27;s no way this tiara is sized to fit a young flower-girl aged girl.  When I emailed the seller he did initially respond very quickly by suggesting that I exchange it for something else in his store.  When I responded, however, that he had nothing else sized for a young girl.  That was several weeks ago at this point and I have not received a response.    If you like the tiara for yourself (an adult) then go for it, I must say that it really is pretty.  However, don&#x27;t waste your money buying this for a flower girl.</li>
    <li> used for my wedding.  beautiful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I know how to use this comb tiara but it does not stay on my hair bun ;( It&#x27;s also big for my head that I had to adjust it by bending it.</li>
    <li> all I can say is it was beautiful, just as nice as what you would pay in the bridal stores.</li>
    <li> it was ok on the cheep side</li>
    <li> It is quite beautiful and it stays put perfectly. the down side was that it didn&#x27;t cover the space I needed it to but I did wear it on my birthday all over town and it more that served the purpose for my hair style on that day. Not sorry I ordered it.</li>
    <li> IT LOOKS MUTCH BETTER THAN ITS PRICE</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a veil a bride, but I wanted something to crown my curls and this looked just about perfect. When I received it, it did not come in the display box as claimed in the description, but I was planning on wearing it, not showing it off. It was just he right size for me (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5&amp;#34; with a petite build ~115lbs). It has all the sparkle I wanted without looking pageant-like. Can&#x27;t wait to wear it at my wedding! The comb hold it in place very nicely.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to wear at my wedding. I got many compliments on it. It is very sturdy and very pretty. Exactly what I was looking for. It shipped quickly and arrived on time. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is it arrived with the comb slightly bent on a few of the tines. It wasn&#x27;t enough to warrant a return and it still was functional and served its purpose. It stayed in place all day. The best thing about it is you only have the comb and there is not headband type hardware to hold it in place. This is a plus because if you wear glasses it gets annoying when they are rubbing together. Overall I am very satisfied and would recommend it to others that may be looking for something similar.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be a bit bigger so I could wear it but it does not stand out on my head that much, so instead my daughter is using it for the wedding and it looks fantastic on her.  I would buy it again and again!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why everyone is saying there was false advertising here--when I came across the product description, it said girl tiara, not flower girl tiara. In any case, I think it would suit either a woman or a young girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this tiara because it came attached to a comb, which allowed me to sew the tiara-comb combo onto my veil. The teeth of the comb are nice and long to ensure secure placement. I love that this tiara is all crystals--no pearls. It is super sparkly and a great deal for the price. Looking at it in the box I was afraid it would look too small but it actually is noticeable. I love it because it is a beautiful, elegant headpiece. I can&#x27;t stand those giant tiaras that look like crowns--I think they are for deluded people with an inferiority complex. This tiara does what it should--adorns the head, frames the face, and shines like nothing else. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 9 year old niece who will be our flower girl in a couple of weeks to try to \\&quot;match\\&quot; my own tiara. I gave it to my niece at my shower and she absolutely loves it! It is a beautiful piece that will look wonderful on her. I highly recommend it for your flower girl! (Remember this product is a comb piece...which I think is better and will stay in her hair/on her head well)</li>
    <li> I purchased this as my hair piece for my wedding.  I was a bit hesitant to purchase it beacuse of the description \\&quot;Flower Girl Tiara\\&quot;  It is not for a flower girl, at least not in my opinion.  It&#x27;s much too big for a small girl.  It arrived very quickly and in perfect condition.  It&#x27;s just beautiful.  Very sparkly, nice weight to it and feels secure in my very fine hair with just a couple of bobbie pins.  This tiara is perfect. I&#x27;m soooooo happy I purchased it.  I saw another tiara comb that was a similar style but smaller at a bridal shop for double the price of this one.  This tiara is very good quality for a super great price.  Very, very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a little girl who wishes to feel like a princess!</li>
    <li> this worked out wonderfully for my recent wedding, however it is pretty heavy so you have to rat your hair quite a bit to get it to stay and add some extra bobby pins</li>
    <li> Just as beautiful in person. Seems to be very detailed and high quality, doesn&#x27;t have those little jagged pieces that the lower quality tiaras have.</li>
    <li> When my 5 year old soon-to-be stepdaughter said she wanted to wear a tiara in the wedding I agreed only if we could find something pretty and not too big.  THIS tiara is perfect.  It&#x27;s subtle with loads of sparkle and her and I both are just over the moon.  It really is just the perfect little accent to make her feel like the junior bride she is.</li>
    <li> Beautiful tiara. It&#x27;s simple yet gorgeous and sparkles in the light. The only thing I personally don&#x27;t like about it is that it&#x27;s a wee bit heavy. Not brain-crushingly heavy, but since it&#x27;s all metal, it&#x27;s going to be. I&#x27;m using this for my wedding and the simplistic beauty is what&#x27;s going to draw everyone&#x27;s eyes to my head...oh and face.</li>
    <li> GORGEOUS! Definitely not for children, I&#x27;m glad read the reviews BEFORE I purchased! Definitely completed my look. It was sparkled and was gorgeous!  Fast shipping and came perfect ready to wear!!!!</li>
    <li> I really liked the tiara; yet, it broke the second day i bought it. I was extremely disappointed. I cried because it was very sad and pitiful. It didn&#x27;t even last 48 hours. I was about to try it on the next day and as I was sliding it through my hair, the comb split right away:(</li>
    <li> The tiara looks even better and more sparkly in person. It was the perfect size. I did have some trouble keeping it on my head but after a few bobbypens i managed to keep it on my hair.</li>
    <li> This was purely &amp;#34;Inspiration&amp;#34; which I dunno How I came up with. Looking for a B&#x27;day present for my sweet adopted-from-afar granddaughter, I somehow thought &amp;#34;Tiara&amp;#34;! Altho she&#x27;s cute, she isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34;,l as her 2 sisters are, (except Inwardly, she shines). I wanted something to make her feel like the &amp;#34;Princess&amp;#34; she truly is, &amp; indeed, her Tiara did! She just loved it, altho only wears it &#x27;round home for now, of course. Even If she&#x27;s helping do the dishes, etc., I&#x27;m told. And it&#x27;s just beautiful. Sincerely, from &amp;#34;Kathsong&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> one word.. Beautiful!</li>
    <li> for a little girl…not as an assesory for a bride</li>
    <li> I bought these for my flower girls and they were adorable and amazing, fit really well in their updos.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have thick enough hair to hold this on my head. It is very pretty though.  It would look good on a french twist though.</li>
    <li> Beautiful! I wore this for my wedding. It is petite and lovely. A tiara that is not over the top, just perfect :)</li>
    <li> I received it broken, I used glue to put it together. but I was not sure if it could hold it though the whole night so I used something else.</li>
    <li> Excelente proveedor, presta un  muy buen servicio los recomiendo.Gracias son muy serios y todo es nuevo y de excelente calidad.</li>
    <li> but, it is WAY TOO HEAVY. Unless you are Rapunzel, this won&#x27;t stay in your hair. I loved the idea, the look and the ellegance of it, it just does not work for me. Sorry, I had to return it for a refund - am waiting for the refund to be put back on my credit card.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my 7yr. Old Daughter who&#x27;s gonna have her 1st Communion this May. It did fit to her head. It is a very nice size it looks and feel sturdy too.</li>
    <li> the product is very nice</li>
    <li> Pics were a little miss leading</li>
    <li> Loved this Tiara...So pretty!</li>
    <li> was shipped super fast...product is of great quality, not cheap and easy to break....this is for my daughters bday which i know she will love</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful tiara, but I would not recommend this for a girl.  The tiara is too wide for the average girl&#x27;s head.</li>
    <li> grand daughter looked adorable.....nice quality</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful little tiara! I just wish it had some kind of clips instead of just a comb. I only gave it 4 stars because the comb didn&#x27;t work with my wig. I had to attach it with bobby pins which still worked ok.</li>
    <li> We have two flower girls for our wedding so we bought two of these. They came in looking nice and will serve the purpose just fine!</li>
    <li> Horrible tiara the studs are not glued properly......disappointing!</li>
    <li> I wore this for my wedding and it was perfect. I wanted a cute but simply tiara and this was it. I love how small it was.</li>
    <li> Nice ,but little short</li>
    <li> Very beautiful and well made! It works well on a comb...not as big as a full tiara, but every bit as pretty. I got this as a Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> Used in place of a barrette for wedding hair.  Did a partial updo and it looked wonderful for the wedding.</li>
