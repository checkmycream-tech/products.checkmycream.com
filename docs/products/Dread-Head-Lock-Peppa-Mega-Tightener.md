      <li>Great Stuff!</li>
      <li>HAVE THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER</li>
      <li>Lock Peppa did its job wonderfully.</li>
      <li>Additionally, the product is best used by dipping your fingertips into the powder-</li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome!</li>
      <li>that for sure!!!</li>
      <li>This is a great product.</li>
      <li>another great way to get your hair to tighten, use Dr Bronners 18 in 1 castile soaps.</li>
      <li>Great product tho.</li>
      <li>IT WORKS GREAT</li>
      <li>but this stuff is amazing!</li>
      <li>good luck.</li>
      <li>But all in all good product.&amp;#34; 4 stars</li>
      <li>and I knew that they needed to look good if I was going to allow it.</li>
      <li>They changed the package, the top was shrink wrapped to prevent any from leaving the bottle in shipping!</li>
      <li>Love lock peppa!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very light powder..</li>
      <li>so this better work or</li>
      <li>For the people that assume you sprinkle it on your scalp and it&#x27;s going to magically do the work by itself....</li>
      <li>i not even sure there is anything in it.</li>
      <li>and the knots have to be able to form the way they want to.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I want to keep it cut to this length, because besides the unraveling, I love my hair like this.  </li>
      <li>; is mostly a myth.</li>
      <li>This product is great for his straight oily hair since it dries it out and makes it lock better and quicker.</li>
      <li>if you really want to do something take very warm water.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for something a bit more permanent, but I do think it does fine for what I&#x27;m looking for.  </li>
      <li>is also very good while starting your dreads.</li>
      <li>I found that the toothpaste also, even more efficiently, held the tips of my locs together, but cleanly washed out at shampoo time.   </li>
      <li>so light</li>
      <li>So far so good; I&#x27;d recommend it</li>
      <li>It it a great binder for loose hair.</li>
      <li>, i just didn&#x27;t have much to work with after most of it was lost during the shipping process.</li>
      <li>Good product for producing froction during the locking process, although, my container of peppa wasn&#x27;t sealed properly prior to shipment so quite a bit of the product was lost in the packaging.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
      <li>Trust me I bought with full excitement</li>
      <li>I have very straight, fine hair.</li>
      <li>Better packaging would make this product alot better especially considering the price..</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with the product and would purchase it again in the future.</li>
      <li>It is a fine power which, on a microscopic scale, is very abrasive.</li>
      <li>Lock Peppa really does make a huge difference in how well your locks tighten up.</li>
      <li>My main concern with silica is whether it washes out of the dreadlocks easily.  </li>
      <li>Great product that works well to tame the frizz.</li>
      <li>My best guess is that the main ingredient in Lock Peppa, silica, helps aid in locking by scratching up the cuticle layer of the hair on a microscopic level, which then helps the hairs to grip each other more, the same as if they did if you had naturally lifted cuticles.    </li>
      <li>If they sealed the bottles inside it would be better, or if they possibly used a bag that actually closed easily around the bottle it would be better.</li>
      <li>It is a bit safer than most chemical/poisonous pesticide, because it doesn&#x27;t work the same way.</li>
      <li>It works pretty well</li>
      <li>and it was mostly the exact same ingredients as acne face wash.</li>
      <li>This stuff was crappy first</li>
      <li>U would have been better off using baby powder it would have done the same thing.</li>
      <li>well i&#x27;m almost positive that it says on the directions to keep it away from your scalp...</li>
      <li>i like the almond the best, but there&#x27;s lavender, peppermint, and a few other scents.</li>
      <li>It might grip more and hold better if I loaded it up with this powder, but I don&#x27;t want to have a white tint to my dark locs at the ends.</li>
      <li>Really good for turning loose hairs into dread balls and weaving them back into the core of the dread.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll know if you&#x27;re this type if you have the kind of hair that just slips right back loose when you try to braid it or attempt styles with hold to it.  </li>
      <li>Shipping is fast</li>
      <li>I have to agree with the whole packaging issue...</li>
      <li>but I absolutely recommend just adding this on to what you do with your hair instead of using it as any type of replacement for your routine.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>if you swim in the ocean very often, and just don&#x27;t brush your hair.</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s not too much of a problem,</li>
      <li>Just don&#x27;t use too much or you&#x27;ll run out</li>
      <li>Seem to add &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; to hair, but the lady who did my locks said it was &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; for locks so I don&#x27;t use it much</li>
      <li>I still reccoment this for new dreads mostly at roots, tips, and loose areas.</li>
      <li>With the lifted cuticle layer combined with the tight coils characteristic of this hair type, the hair tends to hug itself more efficiently, making African kinky textured hair lock up more quickly.    </li>
      <li>the hairs hug each other, rather than the gripping at the cuticle layer typical of most afro-type hair.  </li>
      <li>dare I bother with a return in hopes of receiving a new one!</li>
      <li>The main issue with silica is not breathing it in, because it might irritate the lungs.  </li>
      <li>The main ingredient is silica.</li>
      <li>Since I am a woman not afraid to experiment, especially at the tip ends of my locs which will be eventually snipped off anyway</li>
      <li>get a new hairstyle.</li>
      <li>wash once a week, when first starting the dreads, or depending on how oily your hair gets, and take it as it goes.</li>
      <li>People with straight hair textures such as those with Asian or European background that tend to have a gloss to their hair often have smooth unlifted cuticles.</li>
      <li>This was a HUGE waste of my money.</li>
      <li>Dr Bronners also makes your hair soft, so the frizz isn&#x27;t itchy when you sleep on them or they rub up against your skin.</li>
      <li>I started my locs with braids and found that I had to make them close to the size of my natural curl pattern, because it is the curl pattern that I had to rely on to help the process of locking along and</li>
      <li>I really had to be careful about directly shaking it onto the hair before palmrolling.</li>
      <li>Hopefully I wont need much since my dreads are already locking -I purchased this out of concern for loose hair.</li>
      <li>ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE SOFT HAIR</li>
      <li>I had to give the product 3 starts because when it arrived most of the powder was spilt out and it can get very messy and rough on your hands exspecialy during the palm rolling method.</li>
      <li>Good product, but not worth the price for so little quantity, and loss of product quantity due to lack of proper sealing prior to shipping.</li>
      <li>You have to understand exactly how the lay of your cuticles effect the locking process, and how ingredients in this product that are the same as the ingredients in some anti-parasitic and pesticides work before you can shoot it down.    </li>
      <li>Being African American with a surprisingly recently discovered high amount of European DNA mixed in me (40%), I have hair that is very curly and EXTREMELY slippery.  </li>
      <li>My hairs have a very high gloss to it, even when it&#x27;s completely naked, and my cuticles lay very closed.</li>
      <li>I used it for like 2eeks straight notice a slight change but then just stop using and dececied to continue with out</li>
      <li>even if you back comb them tight as anything hairs will come loose, and will unravel and re knot the way that it wants to, naturally....</li>
      <li>Sometimes it would remain a little white if I used too much.</li>

<li> It&#x27;d be perfect if it came in a small round container with a wide opening (think cold cream or face lotion).  </li>
<li> Only bad point that I have found is that it dries your hands out for about a day, no matter what kind of lotion you put on.</li>
<li> It took so long for me to get it....</li>
<li> buying this please remember that even though it looks like a salt or pepper shaker, it does not go directly on your hair, shake it onto a flat surface or onto your hands and rub it into your hair, otherwise it will be very messy and ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> it will dry the hair out, and cause friction between the strands.</li>
<li> but now that I hear ur stories of loose packaging</li>
<li> it&#x27;s job to combine the loose hairs.</li>
<li> First off, it is a tiny bottle which is sad.</li>
<li> They once reached the small of my back, but I recently cut them to a chin length</li>
<li> On a microscopic layer, there may or may not be little layers lifted  up on a single individual hair that look a bit like shingles lifting up on a roof.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My only complaint is the bottle itself is so empty.. I wx</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste any of your money and time.&lt;br /&gt;This product will never work. Trust me I bought with full excitement but I was so shocked.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a lie, and fake.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY IT.</li>
    <li> I recieved this item and it was half gone! It took so long for me to get it....dare I bother with a return in hopes of receiving a new one! Counted it as a loss.....</li>
    <li> I must say i wasn&#x27;t a believer. I was wondering how could some powder tighten your locks? You have to see it to believe it, but trust me it does work. I had to give the product 3 starts because when it arrived most of the powder was spilt out and it can get very messy and rough on your hands exspecialy during the palm rolling method. Other than that it arrived early and it does the job, i just didn&#x27;t have much to work with after most of it was lost during the shipping process.</li>
    <li> Lock Peppa really does make a huge difference in how well your locks tighten up. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
    <li> okay so the quality is fine, but I&#x27;m just really disappointed in it&#x27;s size. It&#x27;s TINY. For $10 I was expecting a bigger bottle. This looks like a tiny pepper shaker travel-size bottle that a barbie doll would use. Hopefully I wont need much since my dreads are already locking -I purchased this out of concern for loose hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about it cause i haven&#x27;t used it yet but i just recieved it the bottle is so small it literally is the size of a salt and pepper shaker and also so light i not even sure there is anything in it. It feels empty!! Not worth $11.99 that for sure!!! I will not buy this again just because of that alone I don&#x27;t have money to waste like that so this better work or i will definetly be sending it back...smh...what a waste of my money!!</li>
    <li> IT WORKS GREAT ON DREADS ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE SOFT HAIR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THEY HAVE THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT COMPANY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
    <li> Man I never got my tightener! Ordered 2 items from DreadH thru Amazon and only got 1 and a promise but now that I hear ur stories of loose packaging I don&#x27;t know if i want mines at all.....</li>
    <li> It is another tightening agent for locks that tightens to speed up the locking process; it is not a miracle product that would give you instant tight locks by morning. It helps take away 1 or 2 months off lets say a 6 month locking process. I like that.</li>
    <li> Lock Peppa did its job wonderfully. It it a great binder for loose hair. I really had to be careful about directly shaking it onto the hair before palmrolling. Sometimes it would remain a little white if I used too much. I did notice also that after I was finished with maintenance my hands had a whitish-grey film from the peppa. It makes me think this product does not come out of dreads well. I still reccoment this for new dreads mostly at roots, tips, and loose areas. I used a minimal amout of bees wax when not using this product and wax does not tighten or bind hair like this can.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and still went ahead and ordered the product.  Spilled in the process just as reported.  I also did not have much to work with and it was a big disappointment.  This is not the quality of product that I am used to getting thru&#x27; Amazon.</li>
    <li> Came 2 days before estimated delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;I am Asian &amp; spanish mixed so my hair does not lock well at the roots without this. I love it</li>
    <li> the dread head products are money making schemes. your dreads will form if you let them . wax, and locking pepper, and all that stuff is useless. i read the ingredients on one of the dread head products to help your hair tighten. and it was mostly the exact same ingredients as acne face wash. &amp;#34;speeding up the process &amp;#34; is mostly a myth. dreads take patience, and time. and the knots have to be able to form the way they want to. even if you back comb them tight as anything hairs will come loose, and will unravel and re knot the way that it wants to, naturally.... if you really want to do something take very warm water. add a bit of lemon juice and some sea salt and put in a spray bottle. be careful not to spray a ton on your scalp, cause the salt can dry it out and make it slightly itchy  it will dry the hair out, and cause friction between the strands. if you swim in the ocean very often, and just don&#x27;t brush your hair. it will lock like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. another great way to get your hair to tighten, use Dr Bronners 18 in 1 castile soaps. i like the almond the best, but there&#x27;s lavender, peppermint, and a few other scents. they make a bar. and liquid. when washing, rinsing and drying do it in a clockwise motion. wash once a week, when first starting the dreads, or depending on how oily your hair gets, and take it as it goes. Dr Bronners also makes your hair soft, so the frizz isn&#x27;t itchy when you sleep on them or they rub up against your skin. you can also use tea tree oil to tame the frizz. good luck. and keep locking.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the product and would purchase it again in the future. I have thin, straight hair but this product worked,</li>
    <li> It gave  my hair and scalps he appearance as if I had dandruff. It also caused my hair and scalp to smell sour. It is a costly product and not worth it. In retrospect , I could have used corn starch. It didn&#x27;t aid in dreading my hair at all. All it did was stiffen the hair strands .  Can I have a refund???</li>
    <li> Love lock peppa!  Great product that works well to tame the frizz. Really good for turning loose hairs into dread balls and weaving them back into the core of the dread.  Works well with a weaving hook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint is the packaging. The lid is ridiculously difficult to twist open. Additionally, the product is best used by dipping your fingertips into the powder- I don&#x27;t like having to get an additional container to pour some in every time we use it. It&#x27;d be perfect if it came in a small round container with a wide opening (think cold cream or face lotion).  But all in all good product.&amp;#34; 4 stars</li>
    <li> This stuff was crappy first it arrived with half gone second all it left was white stuff all n the hair. U would have been better off using baby powder it would have done the same thing. People  would make anything for money they should call it &amp;#34;probably won&#x27;t lock peppa&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Here is the thing, we love the dread pepper which is why we keep ordering it, but the packaging of this product is horrible! First off, it is a tiny bottle which is sad. But the worst part is they put the bottle in a plastic bag that is too small to hold in and the lid always opens up and the powder comes out everywhere losing precious product. This has happened two or three times. If they sealed the bottles inside it would be better, or if they possibly used a bag that actually closed easily around the bottle it would be better. Disappointing everytime.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it does! I used it for like 2eeks straight notice a slight change but then just stop using and dececied to continue with out</li>
    <li> I like this product. I think it helps with locking in my semi-baby (6+ months) dreads. I have to point out that the people complaining about it making their scalp all weird and flaking and they don&#x27;t like it....well i&#x27;m almost positive that it says on the directions to keep it away from your scalp...so that might be the answer there. I have to agree with the whole packaging issue...mine wasn&#x27;t TOO bad, but it&#x27;s definitely a little messy--But the company sent me a message that they are working on repackaging the product to reduce this problem. So far so good; I&#x27;d recommend it</li>
    <li> Works very well. If you are a white person with dreadlocks you can use this shortly after washing your hair to tighten everything back up while palmrolling. It works pretty well but I absolutely recommend just adding this on to what you do with your hair instead of using it as any type of replacement for your routine.&lt;br /&gt;It is also very good while starting your dreads. Just don&#x27;t use too much or you&#x27;ll run out quick.&lt;br /&gt;When buying this please remember that even though it looks like a salt or pepper shaker, it does not go directly on your hair, shake it onto a flat surface or onto your hands and rub it into your hair, otherwise it will be very messy and ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;I used this and a crochet needle for my hair and my dreadlocks locked within 6 months.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It&#x27;s my second time buying and neve let&#x27;s me down. Shipping is fast</li>
    <li> People are skeptical of this product, without knowing the first thing about the ingredients or about hair.  You have to understand exactly how the lay of your cuticles effect the locking process, and how ingredients in this product that are the same as the ingredients in some anti-parasitic and pesticides work before you can shoot it down.    On a microscopic layer, there may or may not be little layers lifted  up on a single individual hair that look a bit like shingles lifting up on a roof. Those are your cuticles. People with kinky African texture hair usually have cuticles that are slightly lifted.  Lifted cuticles tend to cling to the cuticles of other neighboring hairs.  With the lifted cuticle layer combined with the tight coils characteristic of this hair type, the hair tends to hug itself more efficiently, making African kinky textured hair lock up more quickly.    Others may have cuticles that lay flat on a microscopic layer.  People with straight hair textures such as those with Asian or European background that tend to have a gloss to their hair often have smooth unlifted cuticles. You&#x27;ll know if you&#x27;re this type if you have the kind of hair that just slips right back loose when you try to braid it or attempt styles with hold to it.  This is the type that is difficult to dreadlock, and it is this hair type that this product is aimed at.    This is where lock peppa comes in.  The main ingredient is silica. Silica is nontoxic. It is a fine power which, on a microscopic scale, is very abrasive. It is used in some pesticides and antiparisitic applications because, on a microscopic level, it shreds up the insect&#x27;s exoskeleton, and dries the insect out.  It is a bit safer than most chemical/poisonous pesticide, because it doesn&#x27;t work the same way. The main issue with silica is not breathing it in, because it might irritate the lungs.  It is also noteworthy that it&#x27;s abrasive action is widely used in toothpaste, which helps scrape the crap off your teeth.  Soit&#x27;s definitely not the demon that people want to make it out to be.    My best guess is that the main ingredient in Lock Peppa, silica, helps aid in locking by scratching up the cuticle layer of the hair on a microscopic level, which then helps the hairs to grip each other more, the same as if they did if you had naturally lifted cuticles.    My main concern with silica is whether it washes out of the dreadlocks easily.  I think it&#x27;s not too much of a problem, provided you follow the manufacturers instructions about just putting a tiny dab on the finger and applying it to your locs this way.    Being African American with a surprisingly recently discovered high amount of European DNA mixed in me (40%), I have hair that is very curly and EXTREMELY slippery.  My hairs have a very high gloss to it, even when it&#x27;s completely naked, and my cuticles lay very closed. Braids do not stay with me well.  I started my locs with braids and found that I had to make them close to the size of my natural curl pattern, because it is the curl pattern that I had to rely on to help the process of locking along and the hairs hug each other, rather than the gripping at the cuticle layer typical of most afro-type hair.  I used rubber bands or hair glue at the ends  to keep my hair together while it locked.  I have had locs for going on 4 years now. They once reached the small of my back, but I recently cut them to a chin length bob.    I purchased this product because I wanted something to help the constantly unraveling that happened after I cut my hair. I want to keep it cut to this length, because besides the unraveling, I love my hair like this.  Because silica is not water soluble, I feel uncomfortable putting it at the roots of my hair, but I am ok putting it at the ends, since eventually they will be clipped again anyway.  I found that this stuff does add a grip to the hair, but it is not permanent as I had hoped. As soon as water rinses out the powder, it goes to being slippery once again.  I was hoping for something a bit more permanent, but I do think it does fine for what I&#x27;m looking for.  It might grip more and hold better if I loaded it up with this powder, but I don&#x27;t want to have a white tint to my dark locs at the ends. I may switch back to hair glue again, but for now, I&#x27;ll keep trying this.      Since I am a woman not afraid to experiment, especially at the tip ends of my locs which will be eventually snipped off anyway, I did  try a dab of toothpaste at the ends of my locs, since the ingredients with this and toothpaste is actually comparable. I found that the toothpaste also, even more efficiently, held the tips of my locs together, but cleanly washed out at shampoo time.   So I think the makers of this product was definitely onto something with the use of the ingredients in this product.       Definitely not snake oil!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not how I expected it to be of use, but I does do it&#x27;s job to combine the loose hairs. Great product tho.</li>
    <li> Good product for producing froction during the locking process, although, my container of peppa wasn&#x27;t sealed properly prior to shipment so quite a bit of the product was lost in the packaging. Good product, but not worth the price for so little quantity, and loss of product quantity due to lack of proper sealing prior to shipping. Better packaging would make this product alot better especially considering the price..</li>
    <li> I purchased Lock Peppa Mega Tightener and when I received the package ALL the contants inside the bittle had spilled out and there was nothing of it that I could use. When I emailed customer serviced the pretty much said sorry too bad, this happens often and here is 10% off your next order. This was a HUGE waste of my money. I do not recommened buying this product of dealing with this company at all.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I got my babies about two weeks ago..I have very straight, fine hair. I was having a really hard time getting them to lock. I knew that I didn&#x27;t want wax in my hair..I hate hair products in general.. but this stuff is amazing! They changed the package, the top was shrink wrapped to prevent any from leaving the bottle in shipping! It&#x27;s a very light powder..so it&#x27;s not gross on your hair</li>
    <li> as a dread novice, my son wanted them and I knew that they needed to look good if I was going to allow it. This product is great for his straight oily hair since it dries it out and makes it lock better and quicker. Only bad point that I have found is that it dries your hands out for about a day, no matter what kind of lotion you put on.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t work at all didn&#x27;t do not a thing just powder to cause residue and white flakes in your hair</li>
    <li> For the people that assume you sprinkle it on your scalp and it&#x27;s going to magically do the work by itself....get a new hairstyle. Dreads take work, this stuff rocks. Sprinkle some in your palm and get to rolling it between your palms. Then your dreads are tighter and left low maintance. I have zero complaints.</li>
    <li> Seem to add &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; to hair, but the lady who did my locks said it was &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; for locks so I don&#x27;t use it much</li>
    <li> It works well, with time.  You have to do it several times before the hair will begin to dread.</li>
    <li> Works Great!&lt;br /&gt;Finally a product that works. Will be purchasing again</li>
    <li> Great Stuff! If your having trouble dreading your straight hair this helps a lot. seems to create friction between hair strands. Didn&#x27;t irrite my scalp.</li>
