      <li>I&#x27;m in love with this setting spray!</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>Just make sure to spray before you apply your mascara so you don&#x27;t get panda eyes!</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t feel as nice.</li>
      <li>Nice product, would recommend it to others.</li>
      <li>but i&#x27;m sure Skindinavia&#x27;s setting spray is equally as good.</li>
      <li>But if you have normal skin this is a great buy!</li>
      <li>This is by far the best make-up setting spray I have used.  </li>
      <li>It keeps my makeup looking perfect pretty much all day and most of the night with a  nice matte finish.</li>
      <li>Ive experimented, and not used it, and applied my makeup, and I notice a huge difference!</li>
      <li>After about a week I started to love it.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>This finishing spray is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>This has helped me the most, but I still get some shiny areas-especially on my forehead.</li>
      <li>Also, if you have oilier skin than most, I would suggest spraying on a layer before AND after your makeup application.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried this.</li>
      <li>Overall great product!</li>
      <li>and I was still a satisfied customer.</li>
      <li>Love, Love, Love...</li>
      <li>When I couldn&#x27;t find the All-Nighter spray, I decided to give this Skindinavia product a try and am so glad I did.  </li>
      <li>I was almost going to buy the NYX dupe instead of this item, I am glad I purchased this instead.</li>
      <li>so I use the &amp;#34;No More Shine&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>it does do is make sure my makeup lasts and does not oxidize despite my oily skin.</li>
      <li>And I remember what a wonderful finish it left my skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an only beast, so keeping my makeup looking perfect throughout the day is a struggle.</li>
      <li>Honestly this is a fantastic spray.  </li>
      <li>UD seemed to help control the oil much better.</li>
      <li>The spray nozzle is better IMO as well.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this.</li>
      <li>my makeup looks just as good as when I first put it on.</li>
      <li>It held up well on a hot afternoon and my makeup stayed  beautiful and fresh.</li>
      <li>I have purchased this twice now and it has worked the best compared to other brands I have tried.</li>
      <li>your face which make for easy and even application.</li>
      <li>This keeps me touch up free for a good 4 hours, which is saying slot, since I have very oily skin.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it if you have the money and are in need of a good setting spray for oily skin.</li>
      <li>first time i ever use this product and i saw the amazing effect after i spray it on my face.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s pretty much just a great product.</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference in the staying power of my makeup.</li>
      <li>The Urban Decay Setting Spray did a great job of curbing the oil</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a nurse, so it&#x27;s important that my face stays on throughout my 12 hour shifts.</li>
      <li>I have used this product and the results have been great, 8 hours later</li>
      <li>product does not make me break out and feels light on the skin.</li>
      <li>More Shine keeps my makeup looking dewey and fresh all day with no hassles.</li>
      <li>I was hoping it would keep me oil and shine free for longer than it did.(I got maybe</li>
      <li>Also, I think this product is far superior to the UD setting sprays.</li>
      <li>It gives you the perfect balance of moisture without making you look like a mess!</li>
      <li>For best results, spray your clean face first, let nearly dry and apply your foundation.  </li>
      <li>But I am still very pleased with this product, worked better for me than Model in a bottle (which left my face sort of sticky).</li>
      <li>With this product my makeup will last for about 3 hours, which is remarkable for me.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I spray it on before makeup application, as well as a couple of sprits after, and the difference is significant.</li>
      <li>Overall, though, it&#x27;s an excellent product and worth the high price.</li>
      <li>When I combine this with blot powder from Mac, I can be sure that my face will stay on point for the whole day.</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite makeup setting spray.</li>
      <li>It really work I can hold up more than 8hrs</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m super oily in the t-zone).</li>
      <li>After I&#x27;ve put on my make-up for the day, I give my face a quick spritz</li>
      <li>Love this setting spray even more than urban decay.  </li>
      <li>Works pretty well for about 6 hours!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it works better than deslick, they are pretty even, you just get so much more for the same price.</li>
      <li>this is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>Better than Makeup Forever, though, by far.</li>
      <li>and this makes my face look fresh all day.  </li>
      <li>it will really let your make up zip and seal for whole day. &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s get right to the point.</li>
      <li>Best finishing spray, and the price has gone down since I last ordered.</li>
      <li>Been on the search for a good setting spray and had high hopes on Skindinavia as its sold under a different name with a higher price tag.</li>
      <li>I get twice of this product for the same cost as Urban Decay with great results.</li>
      <li>Will absolutely be purchasing again when I run out!</li>
      <li>The regular formula is okay</li>
      <li>My makeup lasts all day 8+ hours and even after running 3.5 miles!!!(just need to blot the sweat away,ewe)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really is a miracle product!</li>
      <li>;-)</li>
      <li>It is so much better and actually stays matte and doesn&#x27;t get shiny!!</li>
      <li>i live in a humid warm climate and need beauty products that will last</li>
      <li>It goes a long way in making sure my makeup lasts all day.&lt;br</li>
      <li>, this spray certainly does the job, it helps my make up from melting of my face.</li>
      <li>This finishing spray really works wonders.</li>
      <li>Pore size is minimized, and the oil stays at bay for much longer than without.</li>
      <li>I started to get shiny in my T-zone after about 9 hours, but not as much as I would have been without this spray.  </li>
      <li>it really does stay on your face.</li>
      <li>Also doesn&#x27;t seem to do much to control oil.</li>
      <li>I have oily skin, and this really helps control the shine.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m an only beast, so keeping my makeup looking perfect throughout the day is a struggle. This works great. I still get oily, but the makeup doesn&#x27;t slide off.</li>
    <li> Be mindful of the fact that this is the finishing spray for oil control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent coverage, I spray a generous amount and it lasts all day, (10-11 hrs. is all I need before taking it off). Reduces the amount of oil but does not completely rid my face of it which is why I gave it a 4. Nonetheless keeps me from adjusting my makeup frequently, from every 30min to every two hours or so. I used e.l.f. mist and set spray and it does the job, only reason why I stopped using it is because I look oily only after an hour or two of wearing it and it leaves a dewy look which i dislike. Also, if you have oilier skin than most, I would suggest spraying on a layer before AND after your makeup application. I wash my face and hydrate my skin with moisturizer before I put any makeup on. The spray leaves a matte look (natural) rather than a dewy look (mist-like, wet), which I personally love. The dewy look on oily skin only draws attention to how oily your skin is, in my opinion. Anybody with moderately oily skin should give this product a chance. Makes an even bigger difference if you set your makeup with powder, as I know not everyone chooses to do so. I&#x27;ve tried it with and without powder, and powder along with Skindinavia definitely keeps my makeup from &amp;#34;sliding off&amp;#34; throughout the day. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Ive been using Urban Decay&#x27;s all nighter for a while, and bought this on a whim when my UD was out of stock. It is so much better and actually stays matte and doesn&#x27;t get shiny!! Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s a must have for me whenever I wear make up (so almost every day). I have very oily skin so I use the &amp;#34;No More Shine&amp;#34; version and I&#x27;ve found that this product TRULY makes a difference in the look and lasting power of my foundation...I can definitely noticed a difference on days that I&#x27;ve forgotten to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside to me is that I wish you could go into a store to physically purchase it. Urban Decay DeSlick (which is manufactured by Skindinavia) works just as well and is easily accessible if you have a Sephora near you.</li>
    <li> Love this setting spray even more than urban decay.  It held up well on a hot afternoon and my makeup stayed  beautiful and fresh.</li>
    <li> my go -to setting spray!</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin in my T-zone area. Ive tried other products similar to this one and nothing has helped. This has helped me the most, but I still get some shiny areas-especially on my forehead. But I realize not everything is going to work the way I want it to. Ive experimented, and not used it, and applied my makeup, and I notice a huge difference! I&#x27;ts worse without it! So I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars out of 5, only because it doesn&#x27;t keep all the oil away but helps keep it manageable. Overall great product!</li>
    <li> I did not receive the No More Shine formula, instead I received the regular formula which is disappointing as I paid extra for the No More Shine formula &amp; was looking forward to trying it on my oily skin. The regular formula is okay, I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference in the staying power of my makeup. Also doesn&#x27;t seem to do much to control oil. Next time I will purchase directly from the Skindinavia website.</li>
    <li> first time i ever use this product and i saw the amazing effect after i spray it on my face. it will really let your make up zip and seal for whole day. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this setting spray! It&#x27;s the exact same company that makes urban decays setting sprays but it&#x27;s cheaper and you get almost double to amount of product! The spray nozzle is better IMO as well. I&#x27;ll never use anything else</li>
    <li> I think that my makeup stays fresher longer than w/o this product, but I&#x27;m still fighting oily shine by mid- afternoon each day and don&#x27;t have time to reapply.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this twice now and it has worked the best compared to other brands I have tried. I spray it on my face before applying makeup and after.  My forehead and nose area still gets oily, but much less frequently than if I do not use this product. I still blot throughout the day or use powder to absorb oil, but this product allows my makeup to stay much fresher looking for a lot longer.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I apply it before makeup and after. I purchased a while ago and I still have good amount. I will buy again when I run out. I makes a difference if I use it when applying makeup.</li>
    <li> This product seems to cut down on oil and shine a bit more than without it, but it is far from the miracle product I was hoping (and still searching) for. I use powder foundation and oil control powder with this product, and my face still gets oily and shiny after a few hours.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what this stuff is, or what it does, but TheWife© demanded I purchase it posthaste. In the end she liked it, which worked out well for us all, because if mama ain&#x27;t happy, ain&#x27;t nobody happy.</li>
    <li> So I started with the UD packaged version of this stuff...upon closer inspection of the package: realized &amp;#34;why don&#x27;t I just go to the source?!?&amp;#34; Of course Amazon had it and at the best price to boot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY ROUTINE: I start with the Cover Fx  mattifying primer, spritz some of the Skindinavia No More Shine Makeup Finish, let absorb, apply foundation, seal with powder and finish with the Skindinavia again. My makeup lasts all day 8+ hours and even after running 3.5 miles!!!(just need to blot the sweat away,ewe)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really is a miracle product! I gave some to a friend who had SWORN by the MAC finishing spray, but she says Skindinavia is WAY better!!! And cheaper too! How about that? ;-)</li>
    <li> So this setting spray was great. Skindinavia is also the company who does urban decay&#x27;s setting spray. They both average around the same price really. I haven&#x27;t tried UD Setting Spray but i&#x27;m sure Skindinavia&#x27;s setting spray is equally as good. The product lasts a long time. It really does help keep oil at bay and it&#x27;s pretty much just a great product. I highly recommend it if you have the money and are in need of a good setting spray for oily skin.</li>
    <li> It really work I can hold up more than 8hrs</li>
    <li> Works pretty well for about 6 hours! The only park I didn&#x27;t like was it does have a gross taste if it gets on your lips</li>
    <li> this is by far my favorite. it really does stay on your face.</li>
    <li> My skin is extremely oily, as in I can see oil droplets forming in the pores of my nose half an hour after washing my face. This product doesn&#x27;t really give me the matte finish I am looking for, but it does extend the wear of my makeup. With this product my makeup will last for about 3 hours, which is remarkable for me.&lt;br /&gt;This product does not make me break out and feels light on the skin. I am really impressed by how lightly the spray bottle mists your face which make for easy and even application. Also, I think this product is far superior to the UD setting sprays.</li>
    <li> This oil control product contais oil, a lot.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite makeup setting spray. I use it after applying all my makeup. Helps set it all day.</li>
    <li> This finishing spray is my favorite. It goes a long way in making sure my makeup lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not suppress my oily skin. Not in the least. Not when I follow the directions, not when applying before and after makeup, not even using it throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it does do is make sure my makeup lasts and does not oxidize despite my oily skin. So, really, I don&#x27;t mind having to blot with a tissue every few hours if it means I don&#x27;t have to touch up my actual makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a slight perfume smell, but it dissipates extremely quickly and does not irritate my skin in any fashion.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this. After I&#x27;ve put on my make-up for the day, I give my face a quick spritz and I&#x27;m set for the day. I have oily skin, and this really helps control the shine. I don&#x27;t have to retouch all day. The only drawbacks are it can smear mascara if you blink before it dries, so I usually fan my face with my eyes shut for a few seconds. And it can feel a little heavy in hot weather. Overall, though, it&#x27;s an excellent product and worth the high price.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best make-up setting spray I have used.  I was previously using the All-Nighter spray by Urban Decay (the company is actually Skindinavia as well) and was pretty happy with it.  When I couldn&#x27;t find the All-Nighter spray, I decided to give this Skindinavia product a try and am so glad I did.  My makeup still looked freshly applied even after working 12 straight hours in a physically demanding job (I am an EMT).  The &amp;#34;no-shine&amp;#34; effect is wonderful and my skin looks greasy or oily.  Will absolutely be purchasing again when I run out!</li>
    <li> I have tried a variety of makeup setting sprays but this was the first time I&#x27;ve used Skindinavia (with exception to Urban Decay setting sprays which are actually made by Skindinavia).  I was torn between the No More Shine and the Bridal Finish sprays.  I work 8 hours a day and go to school after, so I need something that&#x27;s going to last about 12 hours.  My skin leans on the combination/normal side and usually tends to get a little oily after 6 hours or so after having put on my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last spray I tried was the Urban Decay \\&quot;Dew Me\\&quot;, and I hated it.  I think it was just a bad choice of spray for my skin type.  The No More Shine spray, however, was a LOT better and my makeup looked fresher and mattified significantly more than any other spray I&#x27;ve tried.  Honestly this is a fantastic spray.  My only criticism is that it didn&#x27;t last the 16 hours as promised on the label.  I started to get shiny in my T-zone after about 9 hours, but not as much as I would have been without this spray.  My activity level during the day is low - I work in an air-conditioned building doing a desk job so I definitely did not sweat it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good spray to use for an average 8 hour work day, but I think I&#x27;m going to purchase the Bridal Finish as well for my longer days and see if it makes a difference to lasting power. But as for this product I would definitely purchase it again, and it is an absolute essential part of my every day makeup routine now.</li>
    <li> Product is AMAZING! makes my makeup last forever and no more breakouts for me. LOVE IT!  Cannot live without it.</li>
    <li> Been on the search for a good setting spray and had high hopes on Skindinavia as its sold under a different name with a higher price tag. It does work, but not all day, for me at least. I had to touch up and reapply mid day. Will use it till the bottle runs out in combination with my other settings sprays. Will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for oily skin! Before I found this miracle product I had an awful time trying to keep my makeup from sliding off during the day. I tried everything from primers to oil blotting sheets to to facial cleansers with no luck. Skindinavia No More Shine keeps my makeup looking dewey and fresh all day with no hassles. It gives you the perfect balance of moisture without making you look like a mess!</li>
    <li> this product does help maintain my makeup after working 8 hour shifts but it does not stay set all day as it claims.</li>
    <li> This keeps me touch up free for a good 4 hours, which is saying slot, since I have very oily skin. Doesn&#x27;t make a difference with minimizing pores. Better than Makeup Forever, though, by far.</li>
    <li> I definitely need to repurchase this spray! I haven&#x27;t used it since 2010. And I remember what a wonderful finish it left my skin.</li>
    <li> Best finishing spray, and the price has gone down since I last ordered. To have it shipped to UK it previously cost me £48 and this time was around £35! Very pleased, would have re purchased again any ways</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple of days to try this out and it definitely works. My makeup held up well for over 14 hours, although I did have to blot my nose once (I&#x27;m super oily in the t-zone). I&#x27;m a nurse, so it&#x27;s important that my face stays on throughout my 12 hour shifts. The longevity of your make up will be so much better, however it doesn&#x27;t hold up against extremely hot conditions (although I&#x27;m not sure anything could hold up against the 100 degree NYC summers). The pump on my bottle seems to be a little defective though, the spray comes out sort of heavy and not in a mist form. I end up getting visible drops on my face, which is odd. But I am still very pleased with this product, worked better for me than Model in a bottle (which left my face sort of sticky). When I combine this with blot powder from Mac, I can be sure that my face will stay on point for the whole day. Expensive but completely worth it! Just make sure to spray before you apply your mascara so you don&#x27;t get panda eyes! Do your face, eyes, lips, etc...spray...then mascara.</li>
    <li> i live in a humid warm climate and need beauty products that will last, this spray certainly does the job, it helps my make up from melting of my face.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after using another comparable setting spray by Urban Decay. I like the results of this but I would go with the Urban Decay over this one... UD seemed to help control the oil much better. But if you have normal skin this is a great buy!</li>
    <li> This product works fairly good. My face is very oily. I was hoping it would keep me oil and shine free for longer than it did.(I got maybe 4 hrs before I had to blot). I&#x27;m happy with this product anyway because it does work.</li>
    <li> I use this daily  when I am applying my makeup as I get A LOT of shine and not only does it stop my makeup from smearing off (important with my darker tone foundation), it also slows down that annoying shine. So I can go to out with no shine and if I apply my makeup for a workday, I won&#x27;t have shine until the end of my workday, instead of mid-morning.</li>
    <li> I am an oily beast, no other way to put it really. I normally used the Urban Decay De-Slick but after they jacked up the price and trying the cheaper alternative by NYX (which is garbage) I decided to try this spray because they make the urban decay setting sprays as well. At first I hated this spray. I didn&#x27;t think it worked as well as de-slick and it didn&#x27;t feel as nice. After about a week I started to love it. Maybe my skin needed to adjust. Your skin won&#x27;t be shiny all day and your makeup will last. I used to have to reapply my makeup around 1 pm because it just became and oily mess, slipping around my face. I don&#x27;t know if it works better than deslick, they are pretty even, you just get so much more for the same price. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I get very oily around my T zone. I was almost going to buy the NYX dupe instead of this item, I am glad I purchased this instead. It is a problem I deal with everytime I wear makeup, I have tried blotting tissues and they are not a perminent fix. I have used this product and the results have been great, 8 hours later and I was still a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s get right to the point. I am turning 40 this year. I have the worst skin imaginable. I have always had extremely oily skin. It&#x27;s not just a matter of the T-Zone, my entire face is always greasy. I saw a product similar to this posted from a facebook friend post. So, my research began. Upon much reading, I chose this product. I am impressed. Do I expect perfection with my type of skin? NO. Was I hopeful that it would be a drastic improvement? YES.  I spray it on before makeup application, as well as a couple of sprits after, and the difference is significant. For me personally, yes, makeup goes on a little smoother. Pore size is minimized, and the oil stays at bay for much longer than without. I haven&#x27;t tested out the 16 hour theory, and I would be skeptical of that happening with the severity of my oily skin, but I do think, no matter how oily ones skin may be, you would see a drastic improvement, that is worth it.</li>
    <li> This is the best oil control spray!!  I have extremely oily skin and this makes my face look fresh all day.  It is an oil controller as well as a make up setting spray, it is the best!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve known about this product for a while now but just recently purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;First off i&#x27;d like to note that this is the same company that makes Urban Decays spray makeup finish and is the exact formulation... Just much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;I have oily/combination skin and live in the southern United States. I now use this everyday and it is the first product that i&#x27;ve found (that I use along with Becca&#x27;s ever matte makeup primer) that has actually kept my makeup on all day without sweating it off or making my face oilier in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, if you have makeup longevity issues TRY THIS!</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this, but I received the wrong one... I&#x27;m gonna prove it but i really wanted the No more shine one...</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing! I have oily acne prone skin and no matter what type of makeup I use or how little of it I use it always looks caked on. Then after a few hours I have to reapply. This finishing spray really works wonders. It keeps my makeup looking perfect pretty much all day and most of the night with a  nice matte finish. My make up doesn&#x27;t crease throughout the day anymore either. I work in a nursing home and I am always hot and sweaty from being on the move constantly. This stuff still holds my makeup on. I seriously can&#x27;t believe it! I even work 16 hour shifts sometimes and at the end of the night my makeup looks just as good as when I first put it on. I&#x27;m so glad I tried this. This is a must have for me from now on!</li>
    <li> I love Urban Decay De Slick Makeup Setting Spray but I hated to spend the $$.  My skin is oily and by noon, my makeup will have melted off around my nose and I&#x27;m slick all over.  The Urban Decay Setting Spray did a great job of curbing the oil but it&#x27;s so expensive.  I found this and based on the reviews, thought I&#x27;d try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell the difference between the Skindinavia and Urban Decay.  I&#x27;ve reordered several times.  For best results, spray your clean face first, let nearly dry and apply your foundation.  Then re-spray.  Let dry, then apply loose translucent powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product for the money.  I get twice of this product for the same cost as Urban Decay with great results.</li>
    <li> What a waste of my money. Maybe this product works for some people- but as for me- total disapointment. My face almost gets a sheen after applying it- and it&#x27;s suppose to matte me! I see no difference in mattifying through out the day. I was really excited to try it after reading the reviews, but sadly, now, I wish I would have saved the money.  :(</li>
    <li> Nice product, would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love...It&#x27;s cheaper on the companies website.  No more make-up transfer when hugging people or when my face rub up against my clothing.  It also holds back a t-zone shine.</li>
