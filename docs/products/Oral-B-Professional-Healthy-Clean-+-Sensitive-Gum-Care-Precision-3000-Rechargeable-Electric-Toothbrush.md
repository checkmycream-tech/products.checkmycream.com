      <li>It seems to do a good job.</li>
      <li>Good compromise model.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say I notice a difference between the two in how my teeth feel after I brush, so I say they both do an equally good job.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good toothbrush and affordable.</li>
      <li>you are in the market for an electric toothbrush, I would say the Oral B Precision 3000 is a good choice.  </li>
      <li>Good luck brushing your teeth</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used electric toothbrushes for 10 years, so I feel like I can make a good comparison.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this has been a good electric toothbrush to start out with for our son.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this electric toothbrush in 2013 I was happy until July 2014 the tooth brush was suddenly off while I was using it. Don&#x27;t know what was causing the battery off and I wish they I can replace the battery. I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush. I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t get one thirty years ago. Manual toothbrushes do not clean well. Its a prerequisite for dates.</li>
    <li> I had to replace my previous aging electric toothbrush (oral B pro 9000).  The previous one had a display (fancy, right?) but you can&#x27;t see it while you&#x27;re brushing your teeth, so it&#x27;s kinda pointless.  The detached display of the more expensive versions just seems gimmicky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush is lighter than my previous one, which is nice.  It has a blinding red light that illuminates when you push too hard; also nice.  The pulse every 30 seconds is the best feature ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to turn the toothbrush off after your 2 minutes, you have to hold down the button instead of just pushing it.  This seems like the stupidest feature to leave out - even my bike light knows that just one button push after it&#x27;s been on for a while means &#x27;turn off&#x27;, not &#x27;switch to the next mode&#x27;.  I hope they fix this in the next version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars instead of 5 because of the annoying button.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my original Oral-B brush, and I like this one even better. It stays charged for a week, and the indicator light lets me know when to recharge. Also like the variable speeds.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for an Oral-B Professional series that I had owned for many years. I was very satisfied with the last one until it just couldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore (again after many years of twice daily use). I am just as pleased with this replacement, if not more so, due to the upgraded improvements from the model that I originally owned.</li>
    <li> I love my toothbrush because it cleans my teeth better than any other brush I have had in the past (including other electrical brushes). I can feel the cleanliness throughout the day. It has also whitened my teeth m as well. The quality of the brush is very good, it is very well manufactured.</li>
    <li> My old Oral B charger died after MANY years, so I replaced it with the 3000 model.  It&#x27;s definitely better than the old because 1) it flashes if you are pressing too hard; 2) light flashes when you need to recharge; 3) it vibrates every 30 seconds for 2 minutes, rather than after 2 minutes with older version; 4) it does not seem to have toothpaste scum drip down to the bottom of the handle like my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s great and the charger is small and can go in the suitcase when you&#x27;re taking a long (more than a week) trip.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful toothbrush. It&#x27;s not too simple or overly complicated. Good compromise model.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended that I purchase an electric tooth brush to keep down the amount of plaque that accumulates by improper brushing. The Oral-B Precision 3000&lt;br /&gt;is easy to use and it will help keep the plaque that clings to improper, incomplete&lt;br /&gt;brushing. This Oral-B is a breeze to use and takes less time than when I used an ordinary tooth brush. Get one and save your teeth and the high cost of having to have&lt;br /&gt;expensive dental care.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush! I have had it for about 3 years and it works great. Just recently though, I have had a problem with it not holding a charge for longer than 3 days. I wonder if I need to replace the toothbrush already. If so, this is an expensive investment that only last for a short amount of time.</li>
    <li> I bought this because there was a very attractive rebate and my old Oral-B is getting old and doesn&#x27;t keep a long charge now.&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise, the Precision 3000 runs at a much faster rate, so cleans even better.  I like the feature that tells when I am brushing too hard.  It didn&#x27;t take long to adjust to the extra times you have to hit the power button to shut it off......some people made a big deal about that.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is just okay. It cleans my teeth well, but there are a few aspects to this brush I don&#x27;t like. I used to have a Sonicare, but when it broke after a year or two, I decided to try Oral-B having read that they are a bit longer lasting. I&#x27;ve used electric toothbrushes for 10 years, so I feel like I can make a good comparison. If I had the choice now, I would go back to Sonicare. Here is why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) This Oral-B brush is loud! It is maybe twice as loud as the Sonicare brush I had before this one. Good luck brushing your teeth if someone else in your family is sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The Oral-B brush head is wider than is comfortable. I have a smaller mouth and find the brush head size on this Oral-B to be more cumbersome than on the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Unless I wipe down the brush and charger base EVERY time I use the brush, this horrible gunk builds up. This happened only every few weeks or so with Sonicare and to a much lesser degree. It looks gross and doesn&#x27;t feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush works, but I really wish I had stayed with Sonicare.</li>
    <li> I loved this toothbrush, much more so than the two other brands I had previously . Unfortunately, I was in ICU and housekeeping threw it out!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is everything I could ask for in an electric toothbrush - the many virtues have been covered well in other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback, for me, has been that, if I use the included toothbrush storage case, the inside of the toothbrushes (the &amp;#34;female&amp;#34; fitting that mates with the electric toothbrush) has a tendency to get moldy.  Even if I thoroughly rinse it, black mold would eventually start to grow in there.  The toothbrush bristles stayed clean but it was still kind of gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I eventually rigged up a way to store the toothbrush attachments - basically sticking them on pipe cleaners - that stopped the mold growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, fantastic toothbrush, totally happy with it overall.  Now that I&#x27;ve figured out a way around the mold issue I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> This device is great. The price and the deal we got... Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device comes with a base to keep more brush heads and a charging station. From the first day, we noticed that after the first use, our teeth were cleaner. We now use it on a daily basis and it&#x27;s a clear evolution from the standard tootbrush.&lt;br /&gt;It takes around 10-12h to be fully charged, but you can use it after a few hours of charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device itself has a pressure detector that will turn red if you press too much. It also stops for a second every 30sec as a reminder to change the zone you&#x27;re brushing. This way, if you divide the mouth into quarters, you will complete your brush after 2 minutes, which is what is recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if it is such a great buy, why the 4 stars? We chose the frustration free packaging and well, I don&#x27;t know how to start. Everything inside the packaging was covered by some kind of sawdust from the cardboard, we had to wash it thoroughly to make it disappear cause it was sticky. Really disgusting, please consider reviewing your quality controls for that kind of packaging, since seeing what you bought covered by that is not really &#x27;frustration free&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides this, I&#x27;d 100% recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for a starting point in this kind of toothbrushes. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> No problems using this.  It has nice speed and a good feel to it.  I would buy another if I had the need.</li>
    <li> It works great but did not come in original packaging and did not come with toothbrush head so i had to buy one of them later..</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush.  Works fine, but remember to change the brush heads every three months.</li>
    <li> Works like it is meant to.</li>
    <li> According to the instruction manual, the brush is supposed to blink with a red flashing light after you turn it off after a use to indicate when it needs to be charged.  Presumably, this is to warn you that it will die NEXT time you use it.  However, instead of blinking red AFTER I use the device, it blinks red MID-USE and turns off right then and there with no warning.  I called Oral-B customer service to see if this was a defect in my particular product.  I even read the instruction manual to them.  They said the instruction manual is just worded poorly, and the device will blink red and turn off whenever it is dead, even without warning.  This means that unless you are constantly charging your device early, you are going to have one time every week where the brush dies on you mid-use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy a different electric toothbrush!</li>
    <li> Recommended by periodontist as THE toothbrush to have and use.  It&#x27;s got a great circulating motion, is gentle on the gums, and its use after a couple of weeks has completely rid me of bleeding gums.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd Oral B toothbrush in my home.  I&#x27;m still using the first one I purchased 10 years ago in my summer home!  I&#x27;ve also purchased them for every member of my family.  They have made a huge difference in my tooth care.  I used to see my hygienist every 3 months for plaque build up and I am now able to see her only twice a year.</li>
    <li> It works just great. Does a great job cleaning my teeth. Brushes are readily available &amp; easy to replace. A good product.</li>
    <li> Overall I like it a lot. Almost sent it back though because it does weird hesitations that make you think the motor is going to quit. I couldn&#x27;t discern any pattern to the hesitations. Decided to take one last look at the instructions before I packed it up, and I think the hesitations are notification of 30 second points in the brushing. That notification is one of the advertised features, but if this is the method, it&#x27;s terribly low-tech, and to me the toothbrush sounds broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it is as described, and I notice that my teeth really do feel cleaner. This is my first electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> It holds a charge for over a week. It tells me when I am pushing too hard on my teeth/gums. It has enough speed settings to get teeth clean and polished. Nothing fancy, just what you need to do for healthy teeth/gums. Have bought two more as gifts.</li>
    <li> Use it at least twice a day for the last 3+ months.  No issues. Works great.  Says it can go 5 days without charging, but I haven&#x27;t tested that.  Seems a little slower at day 3 with no charge than day 1.  Best thing about that is you can just get a new battery if necessary.</li>
    <li> This item has more than exceeded my expectations and now actually enjoy brushing on a regular basis. I wish I new about this years ago.</li>
    <li> It does an awesome job of keeping your teeth clean.  I wished that I found this sooner. You only need this one.</li>
    <li> this is the first electric toothbrush I have used and I really like it.  It makes my teeth feel  very clean.</li>
    <li> Received a Sonic brush as a gift and never liked it.  Too much vibration and tooth sensitivity.  The Oral-B has been great.  The motion feels so much better and slightly more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: mostly everything.  Cleans great, nice speed adjustment, easy to use and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  the pressure mode/feature is useless.  You&#x27;d have to be pushing incredibly hard to activate it.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned, hands down. I don&#x27;t really care much for any of the settings, but having a powerful toothbrush that lasts for quite a while and the ease of switching out the heads for any different types is amazing.</li>
    <li> I chose the Oral-B because my wife has used one for 6 years; she swears by it and she&#x27;s never had a single problem with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3000 is the middle of the line; comparing the features of all five models, I found that it had all the features I wanted and none that I didn&#x27;t need. I was surprised at how well it performs and how far electric toothbrushes have come. It may seem a little pricy, but if it lasts as long as my wife&#x27;s, the cost per year will be equal to about three Starbuck&#x27;s trips.</li>
    <li> Must faster speed than my former model Oral-B - which makes a difference - easy to use and comfortable on your teeth and gums.  Dentist says it really made a difference in my hygiene maintenance, although it is not a substitute for having to floss :-((</li>
    <li> I bought two unit, one was working fine and my wife like it, the other did not charge at all, I retain it and they send me another one, I did not test it yet.</li>
    <li> Well built, well thought out product.  I especially like the :30 second timers.  I have invested a lot in my teeth over the past 30 years, and it has always been an uphill battle until Oral-B electronic toothbrushes.  This makes visiting the dentist easier and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> So far this seems to be a very good product, easy to use and of good quality. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> My grandson love his tooth brush.  It really help him with his dentist report.  I would suggest this to any one</li>
    <li> I like the Oral-B tooth brush better than the Sonic. It has more different settings and seems to clean the teeth better because of the small brush size. The vibration of the Oral-B is not as strong as the Sonic tooth brush. The Oral-B Precision 3000 seems to do the job for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item expecting to receive a Crest toothpaste and mouthwash as suggested by the pictures.  My package did not come with this.  I get that it shouldn&#x27;t be that big of a deal that it is missing those items but I hate false advertising and this is clearly a case of that.  I haven&#x27;t used the product yet but until they send me the items suggested by their pictures or take the picture down, I cannot rate it highly.</li>
    <li> Battery doesn&#x27;t hold charge and oral-b won&#x27;t refund the item</li>
    <li> Excellent product... does its job</li>
    <li> I have used Oral B toothbrushes for many years, the one I had prior to this was an Oral B Triumph, if you are older like me you realize that it seems like a year but it might be ten so I am not sure if it was 5 or 10 years old.  Still worked but looking pretty bad so I asked for a new one from Santa.  I didn&#x27;t expect any noticeable difference in uses this on vs the old and was shocked when it makes my teeth feel so clean!  It is lighter weight as well and I like the light sensor that lets me know if I am brushing too hard.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> We had a Braun (oral-B) electric toothbrush that finally started to slow down after 15 years.  This new one is fantastic.  Teeth feel even cleaner and healther.  Almost look forward to brushing my teeth.</li>
    <li> Just what the dentist ordered! It really is making a differencel</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been using this toothbrush for a couple years now. We&#x27;ve never had any problems with them. They&#x27;re still going strong!  I love that it lights up to let you know if you&#x27;re pressing too hard! I just ordered another one for my son, and will probably have all my children using it before too long!</li>
    <li> I have an older Oral-B brush which  I have used for 12 years. This new one is improved and has more features. My Dentist highly recommends this product.</li>
    <li> This has to be about the 3rd or 4th Oral B I have purchased over the years and have never been dissatisfied.  This seems quite powerful and teeth feel good after brushing with it.  Will continue to purchase Oral B products in the future</li>
    <li> I ordered and received an Oral B 3000 model electric toothbrush from Amazon. I read the instructions and charged it for 16 hours until the light indicated a full charge. I was only able to get one full 2 minute brushing and 45 seconds from the second brushing before the unit went dead. I recharged it over night until the light indicated a full charge and the same thing happened again. I have seen other reviews with the same problem. What really irks me is that I have to pay return shipping on a defective product. I am going to order a different Oral B product, but from Wal-mart, where if it is defective I can return it to the store at no cost. I rated it a one star only because there wasn&#x27;t a Zero Star.  Papa John, Abilene Tx</li>
    <li> I bought this brush because my dentist recommended I go electric for my gums (I grind my teeth and brush too hard, so they were receding too rapidly). After using this for a few months, not only are my gums back to normal (no more soreness or redness and I swear they&#x27;re growing back), but my teeth feel cleaner and look whiter. Totally worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Cleaning my teeth is now a whole new experience. This really cleans ever surface/crevice, and has a really useful timer to make sure that you&#x27;re brushing for at least two minutes.</li>
    <li> love this tooth brush, have had it for about a week now and it performs awesome... my other oral-b electric brush about 8 years old and it still worked but I don&#x27;t think the battery was charging as well anymore.  My teeth feel extra clean after I am done. I like it so much I am ordering 3 more for the rest of the family, also like that we have a choice of different type of brushes available to us for different needs.  Great toothbrush and I highly recommend and it came quickly in the mail.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using electronic toothbrush, and I think it is doing a good work! And service from Amazon is just amazing, the first one they shipped did not work for me, and they immediately sent another one to me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a couple of weeks, but I have to say this is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned. It&#x27;s compact, simple to operate, comfortable to hold, has multiple replacement heads available for it, and--most importantly--does an incredibly great job of cleaning teeth. My wife and I both have sensitive teeth and gums, so I bought the [[ASIN:B00006ANDK Oral-B Sensitive (3 Extra-Soft Brush heads)]] to go with this brush. We are both amazed at how clean our teeth feel after brushing with this toothbrush, even with the extra-soft heads. The timer feature is great. It lets you know when to switch brushing quadrants of your mouth by \\&quot;stuttering\\&quot; after 30 seconds. After 2 minutes, the brush does a longer stutter to let you know you&#x27;ve brushed the preferred amount of time. The indicator light that shows when you&#x27;re pushing too hard is a nice feature, too. The last thing I wanted on my bathroom counter was a charging stand for a toothbrush, but the charger for this brush is pretty compact, even with the brush head holder attached to it (it holds 4 brush heads). I&#x27;ve used a lot of electric toothbrushes in my 50+ years. Some have been cheap, some have been expensive. But this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever used. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is in a word, awesome.  I&#x27;ve had other electric toothbrushes in the past, and this has several things that I like better:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The toothbrush has multiple settings, with different speeds.  I feel like this helps get my mouth cleaner overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The toothbrush holds a charge longer than other electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve had.  This is convenient when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The base is more compact than previous brushes, meaning it takes up less of my precious sink space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This electric toothbrush replaced my original Oral-B that I&#x27;ve had for years. Love the &amp;#34;quadrant&amp;#34; timer it has, it&#x27;s even better than my old Oral-B.</li>
    <li> I have to preface this review by saying that I&#x27;ve never had a real electric toothbrush before. Sure, I&#x27;ve had a couple of those battery powered ones but never could justify the expense of a fancy one. But if there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ve learned in my life it&#x27;s that a healthy mouth is one of the best investments you can make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my husband and I have been making good use of the [[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Sensitive Gum Care Precision 3000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] since I picked it up. We have different oral health needs which has made it a really good fit for us. I&#x27;ve been using the [[ASIN:B00006ANDQ Oral-B Precision Clean Brush Head]] that comes with it and picked up a package of the [[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action]] heads so he could give it a try. What impressed me right off was that everything about using this toothbrush is really easy. Swapping heads, charging, making sure you&#x27;re using it properly... I love not having to think too hard about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no basis for comparison but after two months I don&#x27;t want one! If you buy the [[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Sensitive Gum Care Precision 3000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]], you&#x27;re not likely to want to try another brand. It has great features and options, is easy to use, and the pulsing action makes for a great clean. I love getting up in the morning and having my teeth still feel like I just brushed! The timer is my favorite feature, it has made brushing so much easier. The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is the handle itself. I find it a bit unweildy and uncomfortable to grip even after using it for a couple of months but for me it&#x27;s not a deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for an electric toothbrush that the whole family can use this is an excellent option with the sensitive setting and hard brushing alert--something I personally find my tweenager has a problem with. The availability of brush heads for different oral care needs (sensitive, floss action, whitening, etc.) also make this a very multi-user friendly one. It&#x27;s definitely an electric toothbrush I&#x27;ll be recommending to friends, family (my MIL already went out and bought one after I told her how well we&#x27;d liked it), and readers of my blog.re needs (sensitive, floss action, whitening, etc.) also make this a very multi-user friendly one. It&#x27;s definitely an electric toothbrush I&#x27;ll be recommending to friends, family (my MIL already went out and bought one after I told her how well we&#x27;d liked it), and readers of my blog.</li>
    <li> Very good and effective toothbrush.  I would have given it five stars except it is a little noisier than I expected.</li>
    <li> This tooth brush is wonderful. It is like going to the dentist without the appointment and the pain. We bought extra tooth brush heads for myself, husband, and daughter. It is very easy to use and the head of the brush is small enough to use on a child&#x27;s mouth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good toothbrush and affordable. Not sure if it is appropriate for people with gum/periodontal disease. I feel the toothbrush speed for sensitive care is too strong and the sensitive &amp;#34;extra-soft&amp;#34; brush heads are too hard for sensitive gums. Please, I am giving these reviews according to my experience which I&#x27;m sure are different from most people&#x27;s experiences with this toothbrush and brush heads. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is a nice toothbrush.  i&#x27;m not crazy about the recharging stand; I wish it was smaller (I don&#x27;t put the extra heads in it anyway), but the toothbruch is nice.  it holds a charge when I take it for the weekend and it makes me feel like my teeth get a better cleaning than using a manual toothbrush.  I bought one for my adult son too.</li>
    <li> My gums are receding and my dentist recommended using an electric toothbrush so that I wouldn&#x27;t continue pushing on the gums.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how clean my teeth felt the first time I used it.  Now, if I have to use a manual brush, I feel as if I&#x27;m not doing a good job.  Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> My charger stopped working in less than a week.. Very disappointed considering how much it cost.. It worked just like the cheaper models too.. So I really regret upgrading to this one.</li>
    <li> I had a braun for about 10 years until it finally passed away.&lt;br /&gt;this one is always &amp;#34;the improved&amp;#34; version. it&#x27;s ok.. nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;guess I have to get used to it.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend the Oral-B Healthy Clean + Sensotive Gum Care Percision 3000. I like the warning red flash that comes on if you&#x27;re brushing to hard as well as the double vibration reminding you to swith to the next quater of your teeth to brush. The flashing green light that comes on when the battery is low is another good feature.</li>
    <li> love this toothbrush! I would recommend this to others.  I am happy I did not spring for the more expensive model, I prefer this one with the compact head.</li>
    <li> Works great...good charge life! I&#x27;m glad I spent the money....And the dentist says my teeth are healthier and cleaner! :)</li>
    <li> I love the brush itself and bought several more heads from Costco of all different kinds. I think it cleans really well and like it much better than my old Sonicare. However, after just one year of nightly use the battery is nearly dead! It will only last through 1 cleaning before it needs to be charged again. So basically I have to keep it plugged in 24/7 in order to use it each night.</li>
    <li> Does a great cleaning,however the on off power button seems to high up the handle. Otherwise  rating would have been a five star.</li>
    <li> It feels so good brushing my teeth with this brush, I can feel it reaching into every corner and I love knowing how it&#x27;s cleaning my entire mouth. Gets the blood flowing to the gums and the mouth feels energised. Battery lasts well, at least 5 days.</li>
    <li> We replaced our older electric toothbrushes recently and are very glad I found this brand.  I researched Consumer Reports and found an excellent review for these.  They are quieter than our older ones, and have a low battery alert that is really handy.  Also, they recharge much faster than the old ones.  I would recommend this brand.</li>
    <li> Does a solid job at a reasonable price.  I&#x27;ve been using the Oral-B line for more than a decade and will continue to use them.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband when his old one died and he seems to really like it so it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> It is gentle and effective and feels better than the older version . I would recommend it to anyone who has sensitive teeth and gums</li>
    <li> My wife and I started using the Precision 3000 about a month ago after a recommendation from her dentist. We decided on this model as a compromise between price and features. We have been very pleased with the Oral-B and would recommend to anyone. The overall effect is a very clean set of teeth, like nothing I can achieve with a regular brush. The zone reminder is a great feature. I also like the ability to slow down the cleaning action as the highest speed is a bit too much for me.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll step up to the more vigorous setting one day, at least for now I have a choice. Great buy at this price and with the confidence of purchasing from Amazon. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The tooth brush did what it said it would do and arrived when it was supposed to. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this toothbrush to replace an older model Oral-B and it is so much better than the 3 year old brush I had, that it&#x27;s like going to get our teeth cleaned every time we use it.  This unit is perfect for us at home and on the road.</li>
    <li> I love my new Oral-B 3000 toothbrush, but I have a real problem with the redesigned charger. My wife and I had two earlier Oral-B models, both of which had charger bases that were able to work on a range of voltages from 100 to 240 Volts AC, and also worked on either toothbrush. This made it easy for us to travel anywhere in the world and bring along our electric toothbrushes. We could bring along just one charger for the two of us because it worked on both our models.&lt;br /&gt;So naturally we expected the new model 3000 would be similarly equipped. The description on Amazon.com certainly does not disclose that the toothbrush and charger have been redesigned to work only on the standard U.S. voltage and to make older chargers incompatible with newer model toothbrushes. When it arrived, we learned otherwise.&lt;br /&gt; At a time that smart phones, computers, I-pods, tablets, digital cameras, and many other consumer electronics products have gone international, using chargers making it easy to travel with the devices anywhere in the world, Oral-B has gone the opposite way, presumably cheaping out but thus making the appliance less useful.&lt;br /&gt;I wrote to Oral B&#x27;s customer service operation, which responded that the charger for all of its current models in the North American market now work on just 110 volts. They said I could purchase a separate dual voltage charger (Dual Voltage Charger 7040052), which I found costs $21.95. I wish the voltage limitation -- and the high cost of a separately sold dual voltage charger -- had been disclosed on the Amazon web site.&lt;br /&gt; Even more, I wish Oral-B had not redesigned their new products to make them less useful and less convenient.</li>
    <li> Powerful, and cleans your teeth very well. I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth getting whiter since using this tooth brush, too. Holds a charge for a week, if not more with daily use.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush, I really like the different speeds and how easy it is to charge and change attachments. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that electric toothbrushes were really needed. I&#x27;d always thought that they were a first-world excess. But after doing some research where several dentists have unequivocally recommended a good electric toothbrush as the single best investment towards dental hygiene, I decided to buy this.&lt;br /&gt;What can I say except that I love it! It has totally changed the way I feel about brushing my teeth. The timed brushing and solid vibrating action definitely have made an improvement to my dental hygiene. On the 2-3 occasions that I&#x27;ve had to switch to a regular, non-electric toothbrush (like when I forgot to pack on a trip) I felt a noticeable difference in how &#x27;clean&#x27; my teeth/mouth felt after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to upgrade your dental hygiene practices then don&#x27;t hesitate. Buy a good electric toothbrush and you won&#x27;t regret it. I purchased this model because it had all the features I wanted without the frilly extras. I especially like the &#x27;excess pressure&#x27; light!&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;ve found it much cheaper to buy replacement heads in bulk (8-pack) at discount warehouse retailers. A head usually lasts me 2.5-3 months with twice daily brushing.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product! My teeth feel so clean after use and I like the flashing light that tells you when you are brushing too hard!! Excellent!!</li>
    <li> I like that the unit is lightweight and that it has a sensor that tells you when you are pressing too hard, but I really do not like that the battery runs down and needs to be recharged after about four days (eight cleanings). I also don&#x27;t like that the brushing speed is noticeably faster when the unit is fully charged, declining as the charge drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the state of modern battery technology, this unit should last much longer between charges. My Norelco rotary shaver lasts about two weeks between charges -- and that with a long shaving session each day. The shaver is not noticeably heavier than this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Oral-B product since it was first available, and I&#x27;ve given at least a dozen of them for gifts. It&#x27;s a great invention, getting anyone&#x27;s teeth several times cleaner than the old hand-powered brush I grew up using. One of mine lasted for almost ten years. This time, I purchased a more expensive brush, wondering if I&#x27;d wasted money buying a model that maybe had the same motor inside as the cheapest model. The first time I used this model I was surprised with what&#x27;s definitely a high-precision motor that runs faster and it&#x27;s very quiet. I forgot to take the charger with me when on a trip recently, but the charge stayed strong the whole time - five days. This purchase is definitely an example of \\&quot;You get what you pay for.\\&quot; There is a two-year warranty, but from my experience the product will last far longer.&lt;br /&gt;  At first I was very unhappy because of the stop-and-start occurrences, thinking the thing was defective. BUT, after reading the instructions I learned that the new design incorporates that very action when using too much pressure while brushing. It really does pay to read the instructions, which most men don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;  I see there are other such tooth brushes with various approximations of the Oral-B operation, but periodically they require batteries to be inserted, and their operation is obviously poor in comparison to the Oral-B.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good. delikvery is fast. it&#x27;s all that i needed. 10 more words required for this review. 3 more. done</li>
    <li> The product is as expected but the offer included a $15 rebate which I have been denied.  I very carefully submitted all of the information and UPC as directed from my Amazon Frustration Free Packaging.  2 months later I received a letter from the Oral-B rebate processor stating that I did not send the correct UPC code and my rebate claim has been denied.  Scammed $15.46 including the postage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Update--&lt;br /&gt;After calling the number provided in the response by P&amp;G, 1-800-566-7252, I received the rebate 10 days later.  Upped my rating to 4 stars because the product is as expected.  Too bad they didn&#x27;t get the rebate right the first time.</li>
    <li> I updated from an older oral b model that I had for years. This newer version is a serious and much appreciated upgrade. It cleans like you are getting a cleaning at the dentist office. Also the 30 second pause and resume provide you with a reminder on whether or not you are spending upo much or too little time on each quadrant&#x27;s brushing. Almost makes brushing fun. Strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> After using this product, it feels like you just came from a cleaning at the dentist. It does take a few times to get use to the vibration, but is now second nature.</li>
    <li> You might think my title is silly, but here&#x27;s the reasoning behind it. Pre-Teens and Teens usually have some money, but the last thing on their mind is an electric toothbrush for dental health. If you&#x27;re an adult and have regularly scheduled dental cleanings, you probably realize the importance of dental hygiene. So how do you have a positive impact on the younger folks lives? It might sound lame, but get them this toothbrush. I use it and my hygienist swears I get my teeth cleaned before I schedule with her. And it&#x27;s due to access to an AMAZING electric toothbrush. I have given this as a gift to teens and, sure enough, when I visit months later, I find this toothbrush in their bathroom.  I even went so far as to also provide a Reach Access Flosser which has a toothbrush handle and special flosser attachment tips. Makes flossing easy so even lazy teens can do it. Here&#x27;s the flosser on Amazon:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Reach-Access-Flosser/dp/B0017TU2HE/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1395101128&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;reach+flosser</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best power toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had. It holds a charge for a long time, and charges quickly.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush works well, but my old Oral-B from Walmart cost $25 and performs the same. It just doesn&#x27;t have the extra storage piece for spare toothbrush heads. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Definitely better than my last three Oral-B electric toothbrushes.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter.  My daughter said it never worked for her and it was a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> They definitely sent me a refurbished model (wasn&#x27;t in the original Braun packaging). The power button doesn&#x27;t work properly and the timer buzz&#x27;s on 45 second shifts instead of the 30 it is designed to do. Pretty disappointed - wished I had just bought in store.</li>
    <li> It is a quadrant tooth brush, works great, nothing negative to say. I like the bottom size it takes only a small space on my sink</li>
    <li> This is our second Oral-B professional toothbrush, and both have been really good electric toothbrushes. The only issue I have with this one is that the platform is wider than the last one, and is just an odd way to store toothbrush heads. The last one stored the heads in an enclosed container behind the toothbrush, so they were out of sight. But other than this aesthetic issue, the toothbrush is great and keeps my dentist happy.</li>
    <li> Bought in November and this died and stopped working in July. WASTE OF MONEY. Can not return it please save your money and do not buy this</li>
    <li> I like the way that the vibrations changes while brushing so I am triggered into brushing another quadrant of my mouth.  Holds a charge for days so I don&#x27;t have to have the charger sitting out on the vanity all day, every day.</li>
    <li> I wouldnt have purchased this model except for the $20 rebate offer....which i still have not received...eventhough I completed the paperwork and submitted it in time.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve owned this electric toothbrush for 6 months now and the only complaint I have is that I wish the battery lasted a bit longer between charges. Two of us use it, so I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s why it only lasts half the time it says. :)  I like the vibrating timer functions and the directions on how best to brush your teeth (comes with it). The red visual indicator light doesn&#x27;t bother us and I don&#x27;t think it glares into your eyes; although you can&#x27;t miss it when it lights up! The sensitive setting is also good if you need it; I started on that to get used to the power of the brush. Overall, we&#x27;re very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and keeps my teeth extremely clean.  Far better than any standard manual brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It feels like I went to the dentist everyday.</li>
    <li> IT was brilliant.we loved it in the UK it does every thing the box said is would. We truely recommend it</li>
    <li> This is my first electric toothbrush.  Recommended by my dentist.  I&#x27;m very happy with it so far.  It does an amazing job.</li>
    <li> For years I had one of the cheaper versions of the Oral-B line, and I liked it. This model is even better! It is always ready when I need it, thanks to the charging stand, and all the brushes are available to me, thanks to the attached brush holder.  The three speeds are also nice for various puposes. A quality product!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have all the extra feature as the higher models but it works very well. They want me to write more. FACT: Pigeons don&#x27;t fart!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, because I have an inner ear issue, and vibrations cause me problems. The 3000 has a sensitive setting that brings down the vibration. I have worn my gums down, and I absolutely have to brush with less pressure. I use the sensitive brush head. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!!</li>
    <li> I have a bad habit of walking around and brushing my teeth or even sometimes chewing on my toothbrushes. I had been researching electric toothbrushes for a few months and decided to go for this one after reading the positive reviews and finding the price reasonable. I love this toothbrush! It&#x27;s programmed to brush for the recommended 2 minutes, with 30-second timers for each of the 4 quadrants in your mouth. It also flashes when you&#x27;re brushing too hard, which is something I&#x27;ve been trying to avoid. It really cleans my teeth well and I can feel how clean my teeth are even the next day. Definitely would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> This electric tooth brush is awesome! Best product for my money, I&#x27;ve ever gotten! I noticed the difference from day 1, my teeth are squeaky clean in just a fraction of the time I used to spend brushing. Thanks Oral B!!</li>
    <li> great product- best electric toothbrush on the market- our family has purchased 3 of these!</li>
    <li> This is a great Toothbrush overall. I get a really clean feeling when i am done using it. I like the LED light that flashes red to indicate if you are pressing down too hard so you wont damage your gums or teeth! Go and get this toothebrush now its great! I received it on time too!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent and the timer helps to keep you on track for timely brushing all of your teeth.</li>
    <li> It works excellent, my teeth have never been this clean! Like after the professional cleaning. I use the water floss first and then brush my teeth with this. At the end it feels amazing at takes 3 min two or three times a day. The timer is a nice addition.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Feels like I just went to the dentist. The presentation wasn&#x27;t the greatest, it seemed to come in a random array of boxes, but the product works well :)</li>
    <li> This is very well design and battery last more than 10 days without charging.powerful and has gum sensitive to protect your gum if you happen to press too hard.</li>
    <li> After getting a new a-hole ripped me by my dentist; I decided to purchase the Oral B 3000... I LOVE THIS THING. Now my teeth are clean and I don&#x27;t have to worry about being verbally abused by my dentist! GREAT!</li>
    <li> i have owned one of these, lasted 15 years and if used daily, keeps teeth way cleaner than a toothbrush alone.</li>
    <li> Not impressed with the small brush but it does clean your teeth.  For the price it is built with quality,</li>
    <li> Thsi review was written by my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having never used an electronic toothbrush before, it was a bit of an adjustment to use the Oral B Precision 3000 electric toothbrush.  I quickly learned that after applying toothpaste, it is better to wait until the brush is in your mouth before turning it on! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush has several features that I like:&lt;br /&gt;- 3 power modes that are easy to switch through during brushing: daily cleaning, sensitive and whitening&lt;br /&gt;- a pressure sensor that lights up if you are pressing too hard which after seeing some friends suffer through reconstructive gum surgery is very helpful!&lt;br /&gt;- a 2 minute timer that reminds you to switch to a different quadrant of your mouth every 30 seconds&lt;br /&gt;- a convenient charging stand with a covered brush holder attached for multiple users, or different types of brush heads.  I love that it is covered as you never know what germs and particles are flying around the bathroom! I also really like that you can leave the brush on the charging stand all the time without risk of overcharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used the standard \\&quot;clean brush head,\\&quot; since this is the only head the product came with. However I plan to try out some of the other types of brush heads as, while the surface of my teeth felt clean, I didn&#x27;t feel like this brush got in between my teeth as much as a non-electric toothbrush would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other types of brushes you can buy are:&lt;br /&gt;- Oral B FlossAction brush head (which gets in between teeth more)&lt;br /&gt;- Oral B ProWhite brush head (which has a special polishing cup to whiten teeth, similar to what is used at the dentist for cleanings)&lt;br /&gt;- Oral B Sensitive Gum Care brush head&lt;br /&gt;- Oral B Ortho brush head (for use with braces)&lt;br /&gt;- Oral B Power Tip brush head (which is used for cleaning between teeth as well as around bridges, crowns and implants)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in the market for an electric toothbrush, I would say the Oral B Precision 3000 is a good choice.  As I mentioned, however, I would recommend buying one of the other brush heads to replace, or supplement, the standard Precision Clean brush head.n 3000 is a good choice.  As I mentioned, however, I would recommend buying one of the other brush heads to replace, or supplement, the standard Precision Clean brush head.</li>
    <li> My teeth have never felt this clean.  Believe the hype, this product is amazing not only does it get the hardest to reach spots in a manner more effective than I had been, but it is painless.  Owing to some dental work done a few years ago, I have an exposed nerve, while I wouldn&#x27;t describe the sensation of the brush on that area as pleasant, there is no pain.  I cannot rave about this product enough and the shine I get after using it goes beyond anything I have gotten from a traditional brush.</li>
    <li> I love my new toothbrush, I previously had an Oral B, probably 20 year old, which finally died. This one is of course is so much better, faster spin &amp; lets you know when you&#x27;ve done 30 seconds on each quadrant. The proof of its cleaning power was from my dental hygienist- my teeth &amp; gums were the best they&#x27;ve ever been! Yes, I highly recommend this toothbrush!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had the same Oral-B electric toothbrush in our house for at least 10 years - a testament to the durability and longevity of the brand. I think it goes without saying, but I will anyway, that we&#x27;ve obviously changed out the brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was given the opportunity to try a new Oral B product, I was thrilled and this doesn&#x27;t disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparison to our older model, it spins faster, has great three speed options (regular, sensitive and whitening) and has a nifty little vibration notice when you&#x27;ve done 30 seconds in one &#x27;quadrant&#x27; of your mouth. So in essence, it will buzz three times so that you spend two minutes brushing your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband, who is the king of using the Oral B (I go back and forth between this and a toothbrush) was impressed and said it feels great and does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a long time to charge initially - over 12 hours - but it holds a charge for many days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it has a small footprint if you are a single user but you can add the base to store extra brushes (not included - it only comes with one brush head.)</li>
    <li> Another reviewer compared this to the Sonicare and I thought that was a great idea.I have always used Oral B regular toothbrushes, and for about 10 years I&#x27;ve used a Sonicare. So, it&#x27;s fitting for me to do a similar review without repeating the other reviewer&#x27;s entire and thorough write up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the Sonicare, probably because I&#x27;ve used it for so long. The vibration in the Sonicare was very difficult to get used to and my husband refused to use one because of this. I had hoped he&#x27;d try the OralB because of its oscillation but based on his first experience he refused. Anyway, I&#x27;m not a fan of the oscillation since it simply feels like it&#x27;s not working as much - which I know isn&#x27;t the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My model of Sonicare has a 30 second timer that pulses 4 times during the 2 minute period to let you know to move to a different quadrant in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare replacement heads are a bit more expensive - $24 for 2 vs $24 for 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have the Sonicare where mold builds up under the top part of the brush head area where the brush handle screws apart into two. It&#x27;s disgusting but I deal with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life for both seems to be about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original Sonicare has been at work for 10 years, and I don&#x27;t see it performing less or dying out - but this OralB is brand new and seems to work just as well.</li>
    <li> Like most people I have tried many, many, toothbrushes.  I prefer the electric toothbrushes.  I have found that most of them are only as good as the bristles, meaning the toothbrush itself is so far gone that replacing the tip isnt worth it.  This is the exception to that.  While the price is high compared to your typical electric toothbrush, it is an excellent deal when compared to other &#x27;professional&#x27; electric toothbrushes.  Im not sure what &#x27;professional&#x27; means as it relates to a toothbrush, as I know a dentist&#x27;s office wouldnt use this type of toothbrush and I doubt there are many people out there brushing their teeth competitively or for pay, but I assume it means &#x27;not throw-away&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like the electric toothbrushes, and you are tired of buying $20 toothbrushes only to throw them away instead of replacing the tips, this is a toothbrush you will like.</li>
    <li> While I haven&#x27;t gone to the dentist since I started using this toothbrush, I have noticed my teeth and gums look a lot healthier!&lt;br /&gt; - Stays charged for long periods of time&lt;br /&gt; - Takes up very little room on the counter&lt;br /&gt; - You barely notice the two minutes that goes by when you are brushing your teeth&lt;br /&gt; - The charging base is easy to clean</li>
    <li> This is by far the best electric toothbrush that I have ever owned.  It even has a light that alerts you when you are pressing too hard on your gums.  It provides three speeds and one of the speeds is good for massaging the gums.  It also alerts you when the battery needs recharging.  I am very satisfied with this product!</li>
    <li> I had a Sonicare Essence that finally quit on me.  So I did a lot of research for a higher grade toothbrush and found this one.  I like it much better and even though the head is a little large, it FITS better than the Sonicare brush heads, especially when cleaning the Wisdom teeth and molars.  The backs of my front teeth feel cleaner also.&lt;br /&gt;Great toothbrush.  buy it.</li>
    <li> If you are expecting a rebate on your purchase, don&#x27;t hold you breath. I saw at the time that I purchased this item that there were many complaints from customers about not receiving rebates because the rebate center said that they did&#x27;nt send the UPC label, which they said that they had. For that reason, I sent every UPC label on that box, including the shipping UPC label, for a total of 3 UPC&#x27;s. They sent me a refusal to pay the refund letter saying that I had not sent the original UPC. The sent a copy of the original receipt with only 1 of the 3 UPC&#x27;s that I sent pictured. The staple holes where the other 2 were attached are still visable. I will never purchase another product from Oral-B</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is fantastic. It&#x27;s my first experience with an electric toothbrush. Now I wish I had one always. Talk about power and clean!!! Love it! I&#x27;ve always been big on oral hygeine, brushing, flossing, ...even using an interdental brush. While flossing is still a must, of course, this has made my teeth feel cleaner than EVER! It&#x27;s like I just walked out of the dentist office. This will be on my Christmas shopping list for my fam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush also times you to ensure you spend at least the suggested 30 seconds per quadrant and also tells you if you are pressing too hard.  It is fantastic. And it would be great for that kid that rushes through brushing.</li>
    <li> I come to this toothbrush after considerable experience with the Phillips Sonicare Elite and the Sonicare Flexcare rechargeable brushes. The Sonicare brushes worked on a different motion: lateral vibration (that is, vertical up/down when the brush is held along the teeth) rather than the Oral-B&#x27;s rotary motion. The Oral-B offers normal, sensitive and \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; speeds, and signals (with a stutter in the vibration) at regular intervals to tell you to move on to the next quadrant of your teeth -- all of this similar to the Flexcare. (The Sonicare Elite only had one speed, and a clunky design, so I&#x27;m keeping to the Oral-B/Flexcare comparison, since they&#x27;re comparable products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Oral-B has an advantage in that it will signal (with a stutter and a red light) if you&#x27;re pressing too hard. Any electric toothbrush like this requires a light touch -- like holding a flute -- so I find the pressure signal a bit insensitive, coming on when the user bears down with a fair amount of force. It has advantages over the Flexcare in price ($78.97 v. $104.97 at this writing), in the pressure signal (Flexcare has none), and in the fact that Oral-B replacement toothbrushes seem to be more readily-available in retail drug stores and whatnot. The Oral-B does not, however, signal a depleted battery until it&#x27;s low (then you get a red light) and seems to require 10-12 hours to recharge. Also, the Oral-B, once \\&quot;on\\&quot;, seems to require a deliberate \\&quot;off\\&quot; by the user as it will cycle through all three speeds consecutively -- not shut off after the selected cycle, as with Flexcare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the brush motion, you may prefer Oral-B if you want something small enough to get behind the last molars and if you prefer this motion. It&#x27;s not the up-and-down-the-tooth motion we were taught since childhood, but you may want to check with your dentist. Certainly, having electric toothbrushes have saved me a lot of dental work, so I do recommend a product like this. I still prefer the Sonicare Flexcare but I can see advantages with the Oral-B.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used The Oral-B line for years and have never had better checkups or had my dentist more pleased with the general health of my teeth and gums so trying out this one was no great hardship. Here&#x27;s what I discovered in comparison with an older model Oral-B:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The 3000 is a bit smaller in diameter and feels a bit lighter in comparison with the older version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The new tray system where the brush heads are stored with the charger is significantly more convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The three speeds adds to the brushes versatility and while I don&#x27;t use the sensitive or whitening speeds I definitely can see why they would be beneficial for those purposes. The sensitive setting is very gentle but still gives the teeth the necessary cleaning and the variable speed of fast/slow of the whitening setting mimics the one in the dentist&#x27;s office very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The vibration that is set off after about 30 seconds is a nice reminder to move on or slow down as your brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. The sensitivity light is a bit harsh. I understand the need for this as pressing too hard with an electric brush can be a problem but that orange light shining in your eyes is just a bit much. Something a bit less bright and annoying would have been better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The charging light seems to suffer from the same need to be noticed as it lights up the darkened bathroom from across the hall in my house as it blinks on and off until charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros definitely out weigh the cons for me, but my issues with the lights just make me want to dock it a star as I think with a bit more thought these would have been useful features rather than annoying ones. That being said, as a regular user of this product line I am definitely happy with this version.</li>
    <li> I was previously using another Oral-B electric toothbrush until receiving this one.  I like the fact that there are three speeds on this, daily care, sensitive, and whitening.  I mainly use the sensitive speed (the second one) because the first speed seems too fast for me.  I have not tried the whitening speed because my teeth are already so bright you need shades; lol.  I&#x27;m thinking the whitening speed is for whitening toothpaste and I don&#x27;t use toothpaste on the brush.  (I also brush with a manual brush that I use toothpaste with).  It has a 30 second stuttering timer to remind you to brush all four sections of your mouth.  The Oral-B Professional Care electric toothbrush I was using had the on/off switch sticking out where my thumb always wanted to be and I mistakenly shut off the toothbrush about the half the time.  This brush has the on/off switch indented so there&#x27;s no chance of mistakenly turning it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like most about this tooth brush is the pressure sensor.  I have a tendency to brush too hard (been told that by Dentists) and every once in a while I get this red light that goes off in my face when I&#x27;m brushing too hard (mainly on my back teeth because that seems to be where the most plaque forms).  I was actually surprised the first couple times that I used this that my gums slightly bled, even though I have used an electric toothbrush for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are six different brush heads that can be used with this and the brush heads I already had for my other Oral-B brush also fit this one, which is a plus.  I would definitely recommend this brush and the price seems reasonable for an electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a while since I have used an electric toothbrush, but now that I&#x27;ve tried this one, I love it. It comes with a base that plugs in and charges the toothbrush, brushes, and a brush holder attached to the base. It took over 12 hours to initially charge the toothbrush, but after that, it&#x27;s been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions on use of the toothbrush are clear and the toothbrush is easy to use. I like the lower sensitive gum setting that is available. The brush also signals you (it actually seems to stall for second) that it&#x27;s time to move on to the next quadrant of your teeth to make sure you brush your teeth for the recommended time. My teeth feel cleaner after using this electric toothbrush, as opposed to a regular toothbrush. I am very pleased with this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Give me a nice clean feeling and has made my teeth healthier.</li>
    <li> The wife wanted it and after using it for about 6 weeks she loves it.  She is trying to get me to buy another for my self.</li>
    <li> Replaced an older sonicare with this oral b and could not be happier. The thicker shaft on the brush head takes some getting used to but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an older Oral B whose battery was dying after about 5 years of use.  This one is MUCH lighter and easier to hold on to when it gets wet.  I think the motor is a bit faster, but I&#x27;m not sure that makes much of a difference.  Does a great job cleaning my teeth and as a bonus it uses the same heads as my old brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little stand and storage tray are nice, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only docked it one star because it&#x27;s kind of pricey.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush does an excellent job.  My dentist always compliments me on having healthy gums.  And I never have to floss anymore.  I don&#x27;t use the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; settings so I have to press the button three times to turn it off rather than just once.  But at least I didn&#x27;t pay for the wireless connection or the other unnecessary bells and whistles in the 4000 or 5000 models.</li>
    <li> I always thought that electric tooth brushes were a gimmick. I purchased this along with a water pix - boy do my teeth and mouth feel great.  I also bought one for my daughters family and one for my son.</li>
    <li> After my last dentist appointment, the hygienist recommended an electric brush to do a better job.  I was skeptical about spending $75 for a tooth brush that has $8 replacement heads.  This brush gives me that just left the dentist clean every time.  It is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cleans Teeth Every time&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, red light indicator when pressing too hard&lt;br /&gt;Signals with variant vibration to move to next section of mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Messy on the counter all the time</li>
    <li> the tootbrush was exactly as advertised.  easy to use, simple instructions.  I would recommend this brand to anyone looking for an electric tootbrush.  not only am I happy with the product, but my dentist is, too!</li>
    <li> UPDATE after 6 months use:&lt;br /&gt;My initial comments below have become almost irrelevant.  The #1 question is: are my teeth and gums any better than manual brushing?..... The answer is a big YES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just went to the dentist for routine cleaning.  My gum measurements were almost all 2-3 mm, with only one 4.  Typically, in the previous cleanings, they observed mostly 4s and some 5s. Regardless of battery life (which is, IMO, something they could &amp; should improve), with that kind of result, I won&#x27;t go back to manual brushing.  And yes, I still need to floss more often.&lt;br /&gt;I have accordingly increased my rating from 4 to 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INITIAL review:&lt;br /&gt;After only first use, I like it better than I expected.  This is my first electric toothbrush and I expected not to like the action &amp; feel.  But so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;Batteries are 2 AAA rechargables.  Took almost 24 hours to charge and only get 7 days use (2/day * 2 minutes per brushing).  I guess the thing to do is recharge after every use.  I get 3-4 weeks use from my electric shaver.  No one wants a brick-heavy toothbrush, but it just seems like one should get more than 14 brushings out of a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE--  After my first month, I am very happy with this toothbrush.  I had only used a manual brush before, and was afraid it would take some time to get used to it.  But I adapted almost immediately, helped by the obvious improvement in cleaning.  You can feel the difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have now tried a different brush head, the \\&quot;floss\\&quot; version.  Save your money on that.  Obviously you still have to floss.  But the basic soft bristle head that comes with it is more comfortable and less messy, and does just as good a job cleaning.</li>
    <li> It had only one brush head.  I will have to buy another for my hubby. There was quick delivery and it was not boxed like the ones in the stores.</li>
    <li> What an amazing toothbrush! Brought it on a trip to mexico with us and it is just the perfect size. If you are looking for high quality that wont break the bank...you found it!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s been a month I have been using it and when it works it seems fine, however, the electric portion is not so good, it randomly looses power (not related to pressure applied which kicks in automatic breaker).  I will send it back for a replacement.</li>
    <li> This power brush leaves with a good clean feeling. However it does make you a bit drooly while using it.</li>
    <li> I think that this toothbrush does a great job and works as well as my Sonicare.  The head is small enough to be comfortable and easy to maneuver around, yet large enough to provide ample cleaning surface area.  The bristles of the head wear and indicate when a new head is necessary, so you will always know when you need to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are various brushing modes that can be used if you choose.  I just use the \\&quot;daily\\&quot; setting all the time, but you can choose between \\&quot;daily,\\&quot; \\&quot;sensitive,\\&quot; and \\&quot;whitening.\\&quot;  I don&#x27;t know that the whitening setting would really do a lot, but I haven&#x27;t really tried it.  I just use a good toothpaste and I don&#x27;t have any problems.  The pressure sensor will tell you if you are pressing too hard to get the proper cleaning, so you will get a good cleaning every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery seems to last pretty well, but, to be fair, I really just keep it on the charger all the time and use it as a storage base.  My wife has unplugged it and left it unplugged a few times and it keeps a good charge, so I don&#x27;t think that you will have problems with the battery.</li>
    <li> After having mentioned to my Periodontist that I purchased a Oral-B 3000, she raved about it and said I made a good choice.  Now, after having used it for a week, I&#x27;m feeling a noticably cleaner mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I purchased the extra soft brush heads to help protect my gums&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B 3000 has been the best investment to improving the health of my teeth.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush. Really like how my mouth feels after i use it.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly reccomend this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I got this electric toothbrush to replace the previous electric toothbrush that I had which was also an Oral-B electric toothbrush. This one works just about the same as the other one but is a little bit easier to charge (and the charge lasts longer). I also like the shape of the head and brush on this one - it does make it easier to brush each tooth individually and the brush that comes with it features soft bristles and doesn&#x27;t spin too fast and intensely on your teeth, which is nice because my teeth are a bit sensitive and my dentist has told me not to brush my teeth so hard. This toothbrush gives the gentleness of a regular toothbrush but without wearing your teeth down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People who may not have ever used an electric toothbrush may have an adjustment period but this electric toothbrush is easier on the teeth than most others.</li>
    <li> is one star the highest or lowest score.  you should be ashamed of this rating system.  generally on a scale of 1 to 10 ten is the highest rating.  on my orders you are only 50% correct.  i ordered i hard-cover book---henrietta lacks--i received 2 copies; mailed from two different merchants---and paid for 2 books.  my experience with catalogs is wonderful.  rarely any f--- ups</li>
    <li> This is a well built, solid, high performance cleaning machine. I have no idea how or why I would use the three different operating modes. Standard brushing does a great job. The one drawback I see is the cost of the replacement brush heads. But, my teeth have never felt so clean</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had electric toothbrushes in the past but this one is by far the best one.  Not only was it recommended by my dentist (who doesn&#x27;t sell it and receives nothing in return for recommending it) but I feel that it has made a difference in my dental health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are different brush types available for all Oral-B brushes.  I&#x27;ve tried the very soft and the flossing brush head.  They both work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have kids I recommend the 5000, my wife uses that one. The one thing about the 5000 that the 3000 doesn&#x27;t have is the timer.  You can easily see how long you&#x27;ve been brushing, and by the diagram can see on which quadrant you should be concentrating.  If you brush for the recommended 2 minutes (30 seconds per quadrant) you will get a smiley face.  Something to encourage your kids to do a good job brushing!  If they go another minute, they might get a bigger smile, or even a wink (it changes from time to time).  I wish I&#x27;d had this when my kids were little, as it could be a great motivator.</li>
    <li> I love the Oral B electric toothbrush! I like the round brush vs the traditional longer shaped brush. And it REMOVES STAINS! I try to brush 3 times a day, but really it&#x27;s morning and night. And my teeth are considerably whiter since using the Oral-B toothbrush. My husband and I now have one.  I will say that the white plastic thing that comes with it to store extra brushes seems like a waste of plastic. and when I&#x27;ve left it charging overnight it still seems to be flashing by morning indicating that charging is still happening (which seems odd?) BUT it holds the charge for several days before needing to be juiced up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really think this is the best electronic toothbrush I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> My teeth became much whiter. I&#x27;m sure it was due to my manual teeth brushing not coming close to the speed of an electric toothbrush, but either way my teeth became very white.</li>
    <li> I ordered for my wife since her old Ora B was completely corroded becauseshe kept it in a glass with water. It did last for about ten years. Mine that I take care of is also ten years old and still working perfectly. This New Improved model is Superb in every way. i suppose it will last at least another ten years or more because she never keeps it in water now. The brushes last for about three months so the replacement price is not really expensive. Try the &amp;#34;Double Headed&amp;#34; repalcement. I really cleans between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;i use mine in combination with a Waterpic. Another great product.</li>
    <li> Powerfully little guy, keeps my teeth clean, I highly recommend this if you have tarter build up problems. Trust me</li>
    <li> After using this electric toothbrush I felt like I had be missing out on a proper cleaning all of these years.  I like the fact that this toothbrush lets you know how long to spend cleaning each section of your mouth.  It takes a relatively long time to fully charge but one charge lasts a fairly long time.  I am so glad that I purchased my very first electric toothbrush as recommended by my dentist and I suspect that I will never go back to using a manual tooth brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush for my husband because I already had one that I really liked and he wanted one just like it.  He has been very pleased with it!  I have had mine for several years now with no problems!  My dentist recommended that I switch to using an electric toothbrush because it would be gentler on my teeth.  Apparently, I brush too hard manually and have dug out little gashes at the base of several teeth.  This appliance has exceeded my expectations and I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best all around electric tooth brush for the money. Replaced older model after 5 years. Can&#x27;t go wrong with Braun!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dental hygeinist.  Very easy to use and cleans well. Cleans like being in dentist office holds charge for extended time.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush.  Never had one of these and I love it and my teeth have never looked better.</li>
    <li> when the battery on my soniccare toothbrush died i needed a new brush. after reading the reviews i felt that the oral b 3000met my needs. I have been using this product for several weeks and am happy with the choice. I feel the oral b does a better job cleaning my teeth than the sonic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always hated brushing my teeth because my gag reflex is so strong I felt like throwing up when I brushed my back teeth or got even a little bit of toothpaste foam in the back of my mouth. It&#x27;s an embarrassing problem because I was always worried about my breath or loosing a tooth! I decided to try an electric toothbrush to see if it would help. It is a completely different experience, this targets your individual teeth, keeps the foam to a minimum, and the sensation in your mouth is much different than brushing yourself. Ahhh clean teeth and fresh breath! I hope this review helps others out there.</li>
    <li> This was my first electric toothbrush purchase, and I read lots of reviews before choosing this model.  I didn&#x27;t need the best of the best, but wanted something decent.  I like that it has an setting for sensitive gums, which I used for the first week or so.  My teeth feel unbelievably clean compared to the regular toothbrush- I always had trouble getting around the last molars.  My teeth were also noticeably whiter after 2-3 weeks of use.  I see it has a &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; setting but can&#x27;t really figure out how it&#x27;s different from the normal setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t love about it is that I have to remove the head to rinse toothpaste from the inside every time.  I also think it should come with a cover for the brush so that you can travel with it.</li>
    <li> I wish it shut off at the 2 min. other than that I like it. It does a great job!</li>
    <li> I bought an Oral-B 3000 from Amazon in 4/05.  Worked great until I dropped it and broke the tip.  It still worked but I had to be careful to hold it upright so the brush wouldn&#x27;t fall off.  I put up with that for about four months before buying this one.</li>
    <li> Tooth brush works great. Only dislike is that you have to push button to turn off three times. It has three levels of cleaning so to rinse following directions you have to remove from mouth when it is running to clean.</li>
    <li> I like the timer. I generally do not use the various speed or vibration settings. It seems to do a good job.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush has settings to accommodate standard and sensitive settings.  The cleaning it delivers is excellent and it stimulates the gums as well.</li>
    <li> It is small and easily fits my mouth.  My teeth look whiter and am looking forward to a good checkup.</li>
    <li> So far as I can tell, this works just the same as any other Oral B electric toothbrush, namely, about as well as electric toothbrushes usually work.  That&#x27;s usually pretty good, in my experience.  In this case, however, the \\&quot;rechargeable\\&quot; battery did not have all that many recharges.  After once-a-day use for 13 months, the battery stopped working, and -- at least according to this Q&amp;A provided by Amazon for this product -- NO REPLACEMENT BATTERY IS AVAILABLE.  Thus, I spent a little more than $69 for a product that worked a bit more than one year and then became totally useless.  Its only remaining use is as an unusually ugly paperweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is abysmal performance.  I have purchased much cheaper Oral B electric toothbrushes in the past, all of which lasted far longer than this toothbrush.  I would have thought Oral B&#x27;s additional years of experience and especially the higher price it charges for this version compared with earlier versions would have assured users a product that has at least as long a useful life as those earlier products.  No such luck.  If you purchase Oral B electric toothbrushes, my advice is to buy the least expensive rechargeable version available.  It&#x27;s hard to believe that any of them offer a poorer lifespan than this pathetically bad specimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Clarification: I used this toothbrush once a day; I did not recharge it once a day. I recharged it when a recharge was needed, which originally occurred about once every two weeks or so; more recently, about once every 4 or 5 days.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE, April 8, 2014: Before tossing the non-performing electric toothbrush, I gave it a third opportunity to recharge.  And it did! After a 9-day rest and a 12-hour recharge, the toothbrush held a charge for approximately 4 days (or 4 3-minute uses). Each 8- to 10-hour recharge has produced somewhat fewer and weaker charges, but I am able to brush my teeth about 3 or 4 times on each charge. It is not a paperweight, as I thought a monthand a half ago. I still will award the device only 3 stars because I think it is a genuine problem that it cannot take a replacement rechargeable battery.  The whole device must be thrown out when it can no longer accept a recharge. And it is also a problem that the device&#x27;s ability to take a recharge has deteriorated so much after just one year of once-a-day use.  But it cleans my teeth very well.</li>
    <li> We ordered this model as a replacement for an old Oral-B electric toothbrush and are very pleased with this one&#x27;s performance.  The tray for the toothbrushes is better than the old model&#x27;s configuration (the lid broke off in a short time).  The tray is much easier to clean and it is easy to select the correct toothbrush.  I guess I didn&#x27;t realize how much less power there was on our old electric toothbrush!  This model does an excellent job of teeth cleaning!  I think the oral hygienist and dentist will see that at my next visit in April.</li>
    <li> My teeth have never been cleaner except for when I leave the dentist.  I should have purchased this years ago.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been using the Oral-B 3000 for about 18-months.  It&#x27;s the first rechargeable toothbrush we&#x27;ve ever purchased and we can see and feel the difference it makes from manual brushing.  The only reason I&#x27;m not giving the full five stars is because recently within the last month, I&#x27;ve notice the charge not being held as long as it should. The product should be able to go about 7 days without the need to be recharged, but the time frame has decreased to after maybe 10 uses. In fact, after the battery was completely drained, and we charged overnight (9-10 hours), but it&#x27;s never been the same.  I know overtime the recharge capabilities can decrease in strength, but for a device which is used only for about 2-3 minutes at a time for 4-5 times a day, I would not expect the battery to die in less than 2-years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m from the old school, which means that I only use regular brushes and floss along with more traditional means of getting my teeth clean and white. My dentist had always recommended that I switch to electric, because the electric toothbrushes of today will get your teeth clean than by regular brushing. The problem is that electronic tooth brushes are expensive. Good thing I was sent one from VINE, because I was sure missing out. I&#x27;ve been suing this electric toothbrush for a month now and the results, not mention the way my teeth feel, is great! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> My dentist just recommended that I get an electric toothbrush. She said anyone would work! So, I read many of the reviews on Amazon and decided on this one. For 40 years I have been brushing my teeth so hard that I have worn the enamel off my teeth. This toothbrush actually makes my gums feel better.I wish my old dentist had given me a recommendation to get an electric toothbrush! This Oral B actually has lights that come on if you push too hard. Wow....I really like it alot.</li>
    <li> I you have gum problems, which you know leads to so many other problems this it the brush to get.  My dentist suggested it.  I have had a bad taste in my mouth because of gums and bought a water pick - which I love- but dentist said this helps the gum line.  I no longer have that bad taste in my mouth and my gums are not in as bad of shape as they had been.  So if you have early signs of gum problems get this.</li>
    <li> Oral-B and Amazon were running a rebate of $15 for this toothbrush back in March.  I just received a letter back saying I cannot receive my rebate.  Why?  Because I ordered additional brush heads with it and combined with the toothbrush, received a $3 coupon for ordering both.  So by purchasing more, I was refused the rebate.  What a scam!  Extremely unhappy with both Oral-B and Amazon.</li>
    <li> My teeth are pearly-white again!&lt;br /&gt;People are not calling me Sally-Pearls. Lol.&lt;br /&gt;Helpful hint to help whiten teeth: Put a tsp. of baking soda on your toothpaste then brush!! {^_^}</li>
    <li> My wife and I both have electric toothbrushes and they are Oral-B which we both love. They are so easy to use and do a very thorough cleaning if properly used. We compare it as leaving your teeth feeling like you just had a professional cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;They are compact enough to easily take along for an overnight or extended visit.&lt;br /&gt;We are very well satisfied with our purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It works well and cleans teeth like you are at the dentist.  The only caution I would have with the product are that the refills are around $25 for four brushes.  That is not a big price to pay for excellent tooth care which the product delivers, but on a really tight budget a $0.99 special at the local drugstore can do the job (not as fast, not as easy, and not as thorough unless you spend the extra time to brush).  So I do recommend the product, but just be aware of the replacement brush costs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Philips SoniCare forever. It seemed more sleek and refined than the Oral-Bs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I tried this one on my caffeine stains, which never seemed to come out by brushing with the SoniCare. And I can say that in one brushing, the difference is noticeable - the stains are lessened!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does seem more \\&quot;brute force\\&quot; than the sonic method, but it seems to work better, at least as far as stains. Although the charging station is larger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: went back to the SoniCare, because it seems a little gentler. Plus, with a new, stiffer brush head, it has also been lessening my caffeine stains just as well.</li>
    <li> This is everything it promises to be.  Produces healthy clean teeth, timed sessions for each side of your mouth, feels like I&amp;#34;ve been to the dentist afterwards - every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the noise, I don&#x27;t find it offensive.  It works - that&#x27;s the most important thing.  I replaced my other one that lasted 5 years or longer and it&#x27;s definitely a good value.  Fits all kinds of  Oral B electric brushes too!</li>
    <li> I have had this toothbrush for over a year and purchased a second one for my son for Christmas.  It is awesome!</li>
    <li> My dentist recently recommended I begin using an electric toothbrush, since I have a tendency to brush too hard and was harming my gums over time. I choose this model based on the brand and multiple site reviews recommending it slightly over Sonicare models and am delighted with it. My wife likes it as well. The brush is compact, light and easy to use. It fits easily in the mouth and I really noticed how clean my teeth get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally get minor plaque in a couple places (inside lower front teeth mainly), and this brush keeps that area feeling smooth and clean. I also like the 30 second quadrant timer to make sure you brush each section of your mouth the recommended time, as well as the warning light that flashes when you&#x27;re brushing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A definite recommendation here.</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with an electric toothbrush, and I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect.  I had always heard that electric toothbrushes leave your teeth feeling much smoother, like after a dental cleaning, and that much is certainly true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I had some issues with this product that made it difficult for me to like it.  First, I had a hard time cleaning my back teeth (I have all my wisdom teeth).  Now, I only used the basic head that came with the brush, so maybe there is another option that cleans back molars better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the on/off button, which also changes the cleaning mode, I located right where I normally but my hand when holding the brush, so I kept inadvertently turning it off while brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, it takes a long time to charge the brush.  I had to plug it in for at least 30 minutes in order to keep it running long enough to brush all my teeth.  For me, that was the biggest downside, because I have limited outlets and don&#x27;t want to leave it plugged in all day.  So it certainly isn&#x27;t convenient to get it charged up and ready to use.</li>
    <li> My daughter has a problem brushing her teeth to hard and wearing her gums away, so after alot of research, I picked this toothbrush for her as a gift, and this was the perfect one for this situation!</li>
    <li> We gave up on this Oral-B toothbrush. The round head is not nearly as comfortable as the Sonicare brushes we normally use, and it takes longer to brush because there is less contact area between the brush and your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if we had a faulty brush, but it was also very loud.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Oral B Professional series toothbrush system for quite some time.  I initially started with it when my gums really seemed to bleed a lot even with proper brushing and flossing.  30 days with this brush, and \\&quot;flossing\\&quot; action heads, and the gums no longer bleed and it really makes your teeth feel like you just received a dental cleaning...except you don&#x27;t have to wait for that feeling anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My older unit made a noise when you were pressing too hard against your teeth, this new one lights up a red light that is easily viewable letting you know to relieve the pressure.  Now that I have my kiddos hooked on it, I hope the dental hygiene bug sticks with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the coolest feature is the 30 second zone reminder for a total of 2 minutes of cleaning.  You&#x27;d really be surprised at how \\&quot;long\\&quot; 30 seconds is so it is great that they have worked that into these also.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush is fine but watch out for Oral B ducking out of paying the $20 rebate. I sent everything in time and they say I never sent the correct UPC , I sent the details and will contest it, they also see a clear receipt from Amazon which they could have honoured</li>
    <li> I love oral b! I had a lower model previous and it lasted about 4 yrs before the motor/battery gave out. Then I purchased this one and love it! The attached brush head holder with cover is a definate plus.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting an electric tooth brush for years, but I couldn&#x27;t justify the cost.  I can&#x27;t believe how much better this is than a regular toothbrush.  It&#x27;s like the dentist just cleaned my teeth.  The battery lasts almost a week. I highly recommend this</li>
    <li> I had purchased some other unknown brand for $35 thinking I was getting a deal. The unit broke down 2x in 8 months so I broke down and purchased what most reviews stated was the best which was the Oral-B. What a great powerful unit, 10x better than the other brand - excellent choice. And, the packaging did not include the horrible clamshell - thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I love it. My teeth feel so clean, I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to get me one. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months now, this week I went in for my cleaning and I was very happy to hear my dental hygienist  say that she noticed an overall improvement and that my gums are healthier. I bought extra heads so my husband and I could share it. We love it so much that I just ordered another one for our kids. There is no going back to the old school toothbrushes!!</li>
    <li> product works well, comes in nicely packed in amazon&#x27;s customised box. the power rotating brush is decent and effective. the pressure sensor works well. no complains.</li>
    <li> The quality of this product is apparent immediately. Its design makes it easy-to-use from first start, and it&#x27;s overall durability appears to be inevitable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used an Oral-B electric tooth brush for years. This was a replacement after the first one wore out. It&#x27;s even better than the original which I thought was fantastic. I like the signals for brushing each quarter of the mouth for 30 seconds.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother to replace the old one which would no longer charge.&lt;br /&gt;She is happy so I am happy.</li>
    <li> Seems to be just what I needed.  The dentist gave me the high five on my dental care.  Lucky me!</li>
    <li> Gift for my wife. Very nice unit recommended by dentists. Fits the hand comfortably and makes tooth brushing a breeze.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good toothbrush. I love the toothbrush case that comes with it. It&#x27;s always nice to have somewhere to store your toothbrush head and extras when they&#x27;re not being used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparison to my Sonic. I have to say I like the Sonic a whole lot better. It&#x27;s quieter, the bristles are softer, and the toothbrush head storage container doubles as a disinfecting unit as well. I can&#x27;t say I notice a difference between the two in how my teeth feel after I brush, so I say they both do an equally good job. Though because the Oral-B&#x27;s bristles are so much harder, my gums did feel a little harassed the first couple of times I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a light that flashes in the handle whenever the toothbrush thinks you&#x27;re pressing down too hard. I prefer to have a toothbrush that buzzes or flashes every 30 seconds of brushing since I&#x27;m one of those people who tries to do the dentist-recommended two minutes of brushing per session. It&#x27;s not a big deal, but it&#x27;s a feature I noticed was missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real downsize to this toothbrush is how loud it is. It&#x27;s something you&#x27;ll have to get used to if you&#x27;re used to non-electric brushes or quieter electric brushes. I&#x27;ve used Oral-B toothbrushes for years and I have always been happy with their performance.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive gums and this toothbrush really helps me not to push too hard when brushing. I&#x27;m satisfied with this toothbrush. I also noticed a difference right away that my teeth looked cleaner and whiter than versus a regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas and she absolutely loves it.  She feels it does an excellent job at cleaning her teeth and also making sure she doesn&#x27;t hit her gums or spend too long in one section.  She has no complaints at all with it and has been using it for 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Great product cleans my teeth better than anything else I have used.  Shipped rapidly and arrived promptly.  Recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have the 5000 series as well, but considering that in the day to day I only use the basic brush function, as a second toothbrush I decided going for a less expensive one and I don&#x27;t regret it. This toothbrush works very well.</li>
    <li> This is my second Oral-B electric tooth brush, the first one lasted ten years. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I wanted to replace an old oral B (5 to 10 years old) that quit working with a inexpensive model and this filled the bill. It has worked very well and I would reccomend it for these reasons.</li>
    <li> Short and Sweet: Great for fans of the single circular toothbrush head with two speed settings, but I&#x27;d recommend buying it at Costco in the two pack if you have access to this option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full Review:&lt;br /&gt;We picked up this toothbrush primarily for my son&#x27;s use. He&#x27;s five, has been using the basic \\&quot;toy\\&quot; electric toothbrushes with success and his dentist recommended getting this as a step up from those. After about two months of use I can easily say it&#x27;s working out better than I anticipated. I wasn&#x27;t sure he&#x27;d be interested in a \\&quot;grown-up\\&quot; toothbrush, but he&#x27;s enjoyed it actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Easy to use, basic with two speeds (we use the slower speed for him), easy &amp; quick to charge and less expensive replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Loud when set on the higher of the two speed settings and pricey for such a basic model (I&#x27;d recommend picking it up at Costco where they usually offer a two pack of a similar toothbrush at this same/close to price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this has been a good electric toothbrush to start out with for our son. His dad and I use the Phillips Sonicare brush with the full brush head and would likely switch him to that in the future, but this has been a great place to start.</li>
    <li> I love using this. I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have waited so long to buy it. I was recently diagnosed with periodontal disease. I will be living in my dentist office until my gums are healthy again. Buying this was part of the treatment plan. It is the best purchase I have ever made.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush; great for your gums.</li>
    <li> I purchased this toothbrush as an alternative to a battery powered unit.  It does a better job of cleaning my teeth and does not produce as much noise.  Now my problem.  I am on my second toothbrush is less than 4 months.  It takes forever to charge (the manual says 17 hours for a full charge), but in both cases I cannot get it to have anything but a minimal charge after charging for over 24 hours.  This last one gave me 15 seconds of brushing after a 24 hour charge.  Since most of the reviews have been positive, I will take it back and give it one more try.</li>
    <li> Big improvement over our old Oral-B that was 5 yrs old.  Positive: light weight, easy to use, has &#x27;quad&#x27; pacer, recommended by our hygienist.  Negative: no travel case for either base, tooth brush or brush heads, easy to knock over.</li>
    <li> My teeth have never felt cleaner! I&#x27;ve never used an electric toothbrush before and was worried because I have very sensitive gums, but this toothbrush is gentle. I love how my teeth feel everytime I use it, just like I&#x27;ve seen the dentist!</li>
    <li> Product came quickly but it would have been nice to have some kind of instructions/manual with it.  Got what I ordered and no more!</li>
    <li> ove thhis gets my teeth mega clean even in the hard to reach places ... did buy the floss heads for a deeper reach .... Great pice and got here quickly</li>
    <li> Been using this for quite sometime now and absolutely no problems with it at all. I love Oral-B products, though they are a bit on the pricey side, they are so reliable.  Using this method of teeth brushing keeps your teeth and gums so much more healthy!</li>
    <li> I was a bit  worried about spending this much on a toothbrush.  But at my dentists recommendation I took a leap of faith.  I am so glad I did.  My teeth feel as clean as when the dentist does it.  I love it.  Easy to do and so worth it!</li>
    <li> How can you love a toothbrush? I&#x27;m still not sure.  I had another rechargible that I was perfectly happy with until it quit, but I like this one better.  The timer vibrates slightly every 30 seconds and then a stronger vibration at two minutes.  You not only know when you&#x27;re done, you know how much longer.  Somehow, that helps me to brush for the whole recommended two minutes.  Also, if you pause the brush to give it a rinse or add toothpaste or something, it pauses the timer.  Works great for me.</li>
    <li> This is the fourth Oral-B electric toothbrush in this household.  I would not go back to using a manual toothbrush if I could obtain an electric brush.</li>
    <li> My husband and I received a set for the holidays. I was the first one to try this product out and it is fantastic! At first it was weird using this product since I was accustomed to the angle/circular manual brushing technique.  After I got the hang of it by the third day I fell in love.  My husband started using his after my 3rd day of trying this toothbrush, because he is always hesitant to try \\&quot;new\\&quot; things and now he is hooked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush holds a nice charge (we are only using one charging dock, because of the limited bathroom space) and after a full charge I am on day 3 right now with 2x brushing daily (6 full length brushing total so far).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel clean, almost like after the dentist office cleaning.</li>
    <li> I was sent this and it never worked. Never charged, never even turned in. Waste of money, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a little over a month now. It lasts a few days between charges. This baby really hums when it&#x27;s fully charged. It&#x27;s a little expensive for a toothbrush, but my dentist recommended it for me because it has a light to tell you when you&#x27;re pushing a little too hard. I kinda like the timer function too. It makes me brush a little longer than I normally would. I think you&#x27;ll be pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> So far this has been a great toothbrush. I have been using Oral-B for almost 10 years now and ever since I have switched to them my dentist always complements me on my teeth. I drink several cups of coffee a day but since I been using the Oral-B toothbrushes, my cleanings are great. I&#x27;ve had only one cavity since I started with these and that was more of a flossing issue than a brushing issue. This new Precision 3000 toothbrush is great and a like the fact that it flashes a light if you are pressing down to hard with the toothbrush. My wife and I both love it. We each have our own seperate toothbrush head. This will pay for itself in less than a year with the way it cleans your teeth and massages your gums. Great product.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended I purchase an electric toothbrush because my regular toothbrush was, in her words, &amp;#34;...wreaking havoc on my gums&amp;#34;.  So I figured if I was going to get an electric one, then I was going to get a good one.  After talking to friends and reading several reviews on here, I went with this one.  I&#x27;ve used it a week and love it.  I haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet, it&#x27;s powerful, and I especially like how it let&#x27;s me know when I&#x27;m pushing too hard - so no more wreaking havoc on my gums!</li>
    <li> Will never go back to manual brushing again. This toothbrush cleans your teeth like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. Must buy, don&#x27;t wait.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to my husband by our dentist. I was hesitant to try it as I have had major surgery on my gums. I use the sensitive brush heads &amp; he uses the precision clean ones. After two months, my hygienist saw improvement to my gums. I have purchased a second one for my vacation home. I also bought them as gifts for my adult children &amp; they all really like them.</li>
    <li> was not like the one I had before hard  to turn on and off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try one of these after 55 years of manual brushing. All the bells and whistles of the higher models didn&#x27;t appeal to me and just jacked up the price, this does exactly what a brush should do. Why pay more??</li>
    <li> I am so glad I bought the oral-B product.  The teeth feel as good as when the dentist is finished with cleaning my teeth.</li>
    <li> We bought this to replace our previous Oral-B toothbrush which served us well for many years.  This product is improved over the older version and would recommend it to anyone who desires a powerful cleaning brush.</li>
    <li> love it love it love it!!  its like getting your teeth cleaned at the dentist every time i brush.  love it.</li>
    <li> Really good to great toothbrush.  Seems like it works better than my old Oral B, and takes up less space with the small stand.  I just remove the brush holder part.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my few years old Philips Sonicare.  I wish I had bought another Sonicare.  This electric toothbrush feels like a cheap piece of equipment for the price.  It is loud to use, to get it to turn off you have to cycle through all 3 cleaning modes, and it does not come with a travel size cover.  My teeth feel clean after using it so it isn&#x27;t a bad toothbrush, but I feel like the price doesn&#x27;t match the quality.  It feels like a $20 toothbrush, not a $75 toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One month later:  I&#x27;m buying a Sonicare and not using this toothbrush anymore.  This Oral-B toothbrush just isn&#x27;t for me.  The toothbrush head fills with gunk and it comes out of the bottom of the toothbrush onto the charger.  I&#x27;ve never had this problem with other electric toothbrushes.  Another problem is that the Oral-B makes me feel a little sea sick when I use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric toothbrushes for about eight years.  I consider them a must-have household item.  If your dentist says you have too much plaque or that you are just are not cleaning well enough with a standard toothbrush, you owe it to yourself to invest in an electric toothbrush.  Keeping your mouth clean and healthy, can keep the rest of your body healthy as well.  This is my second Oral B electric toothbrush.  My first Oral B was a [[ASIN:B001FXB4EW Braun 7040-192 1 Speed Power Handle]].  It was a wonderful toothbrush that held a long charge and, in contrast to the product description, had three speeds.  I used that brush for at least three years -- possibly longer -- so I have faith in Oral B&#x27;s ability to create products that last. So what does the Oral B 3000 offer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEANING OPTIONS:  The Oral B 3000 toothbrush provides the user with three settings of cleaning power.  Of the three cleaning modes, the everyday cleaning mode was the one I liked most. The whitening mode is weird to use as it has a constantly changing speed and the gentle mode doesn&#x27;t feel like it does a very good job of cleaning without spending twice as long on each area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRESSURE INDICATOR:  One feature I love about this toothbrush is the inclusion of an LED light that glows when the user is pressing too hard. I found at first that the light was lighting up constantly.  Upon reflection, I considered the longevity of the toothbrush heads that I had used with my previous Oral B brush and there were occasions when the brush heads seemed to wear out quickly.  I&#x27;m thinking that it was likely due to using too much pressure.  After adjusting my grip to a lighter touch with the Oral B 3000, I felt that my teeth were just as clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIZE:  The base for the toothbrush is quite large - it seems that newer electric toothbrushes have these larger bases.  With this particular unit, the large base permits storage for up to four extra brush heads. The storage area for the unused brush heads has a flip down cover so they are not exposed to the open air and all the splashing that can happen around a sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BATTERY:  The battery life seems to be more or less the same as the [[ASIN:B001FXB4EW Braun 7040-192 1 Speed Power Handle]]. After a complete charge, the brush can go about a week or so before a noticeable slowdown occurs. If you leave the product on the base every night you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem.  I have limited counter space so I do not leave the toothbrush on the charger all the time.  It typically takes a night for the toothbrush to fully charge if the battery is nearly dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COMPOSITION:  The brush itself is mostly plastic, but feels well put together and has enough rubber to provide a comfortable grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COST:  The overall cost of the toothbrush is average.  There are a wide range of power toothbrush options available to consumers and they can be quite cheap.  You can find a toothbrush that operates on batteries for under ten dollars ([[ASIN:B004NGX7Z2 Colgate MaxWhite Adult Full Head Soft, Sonic Powered Toothbrush,  Colors Vary]]).  Rechargeable toothbrushes can be fifty dollars [[ASIN:B007ZN5ATQ Philips Sonicare HX5610/30 Essence 5600 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush, White]] but options with added bells can set you back over $170 ([[ASIN:B0052JN7XG Philips Sonicare HX9332/05 DiamondClean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]). So the Oral B 3000 brush is in the middle price wise.  Replacement toothbrush heads are currently about $20 for three floss heads ([[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill]]) to $25 for four precision cleaning heads ([[ASIN:B00006ANDQ Oral-B Precision Clean Brush Head (4 ct.)]]).  Amazon currently offers a subscribe and save option on some of the Oral B toothbrush head replacement packages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY:  All in all, the Oral B 3000 is a good electric toothbrush at a mid-range price point. It would be a good toothbrush for someone who hasn&#x27;t had an electric toothbrush before.  If you are a newbie to electric toothbrushes (or even if you are not as demonstrated in my case), the addition of the light that warns against excessive pressure is a good feature.  I think one can be tempted to brush harder under a belief that the more pressure applied leads to a cleaner mouth.  Additionally, the toothbrush appears to be constructed well enough that it will last.  If you are going to buy an electric toothbrush, and you have the funds, opt for one that is a little more costly - like the Oral B 3000.  The $10 toothbrushes just don&#x27;t compare.ad an electric toothbrush before.

    <li> It&#x27;s been a long time since I had an electric toothbrush and I am glad I have one again. First, I love the 30 seconds per quadrant timer. When I&#x27;m tired in the morning it sure helps. I now know I spend a full two minutes brushing and don&#x27;t neglect any areas. Second the indicator light that tells if you are pushing too hard is great. It&#x27;s easy to see the light flash in the mirror. After about 3 days of using the brush, the light doesn&#x27;t come on much anymore since it has trained me! The manual suggests only plugging in the charger when the brush light flashes telling you it needs to be recharged. I&#x27;ve been doing this. I did notice that the brush is pretty warm after charging. I think it&#x27;s a good idea not to continually charge it. I&#x27;d bet pretty soon rechargeable electronics automatically sense when to charge and turn themselves off. I can honestly say my teeth are the cleanest they&#x27;ve ever been!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Love the 30 Second per quadrant timer&lt;br /&gt;- Pressure indicator light is great&lt;br /&gt;- Holds a charge more than a week&lt;br /&gt;- I only plug in the charger when the light tells me to charge the brush&lt;br /&gt;- Cleanest teeth I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a somewhat similar Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush that has worked for many years. However, it was failing to hold a decent charge (I suppose you could say it was getting a bit long in the tooth) and I was excited to find a suitable replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like just about everything better in this updated model. I think the more compact base is better than the one that holds the brushes in a vertical orientation. The toothbrush is smaller in diameter and more comfortable to hold. And it certainly packs a good charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with the toothbrush is their decision to change the user experience. On my old model, the brush had two buttons - On/Off and Settings. The Settings button would cycle through various brushing modes, none of which I used. On this newer model, there is simply a single button to control both functions. Once you turn on the brush, you press it again to cycle through the various brushing modes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here&#x27;s the kicker. To turn the unit off, you either have to cycle through all the different modes, or you have to hold down the button for two seconds. I know it seems like a trivial point, but I often turn the device on and off several times while brushing (to spit and so forth). It made so much sense before when the button was a simple switch. Now, I frequently forget and end up cycling through the modes or have to annoying hold it in my mouth for two seconds while shutting it off so that it doesn&#x27;t spray everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, it&#x27;s a small point. The rest of the device works just great. The product would be near perfect if I didn&#x27;t end up having to push the button for a combined eight to ten seconds every time I use the device.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been an electric brush guy but this is slowly winning me over. I like the thin design. It&#x27;s easy to hold. It has this red light that blasts you if you use it with too much force, which I do quite often. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it causes me to drool. The toothpaste won&#x27;t stay in my mouth like a normal manual brush. There&#x27;s a hole partway down the disposable brush and I suspect that&#x27;s the source of the leaking. It lasts over a week on one charge using it twice a day.</li>
    <li> Thinking of trying an electric toothbrush? Time to replace an older model? Then please consider the Oral-B 3000. I am really pleased with this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I was given this rig to try out, I used a Sonicare which has a brush shaped like your usual toothbrush and it did the job. But the rounded bristle head on the Oral B suits me much better. Somehow it feels more comfortable to use and I think it does a better job. It is lighter in the hand, but holds a charge just as long as the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They both use the short buzz pause to signal it&#x27;s time to move on and brush another quadrant. Good for lazy brushers to make sure they do it properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this lasts, but if it gives out I will replace it with another. I really like it.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush.  My dentist told me I needed to switch to an electric toothbrush and my gums have healed after using it!  I had an area of gingivitis that was a problem for several years, and now it is gone!</li>
    <li> I love it! great product</li>
    <li> new review after I recieve a working one&lt;br /&gt;when I received it, will return and repurchase a new one. new review next time</li>
    <li> I had used the ultrasonic toothbrush systems for several years and due to extreme senstivity I had gone back to hand brushing.  I tried this system based on reviews and I have to second those positive reviews; I don&#x27;t have any objective evidence that the machine cleans teeth especially well, I can only say my personal checkups have been excellent and after a brief period of getting used to the thing I now enjoy using it.  It works/feels very differently than the ultrasonic units; it is very mechanical, somewhat loud and jarring at first but once you are used to it there is a real sense of thorough cleaning.  The only criticisms are nits but I&#x27;ll mention them for completeness, especially if you are coming from an ultrasonic system.  On this particular model you have to push the one and only button three times to turn it off (as opposed to a single button press on the ultrasonics).  This is a bit tedious if you turn off the unit every 30 seconds or so and less so if you just leave it on from start to finish.  The other issue is a sneaky one that took awhile to diagnose.  I noticed that a ring formed between the toothbrush and the charger/base unit; the ring was sticky and when you picked up the brush the base would come with it and then fall off.  I finally determined that fluid was getting into the brush head during brushing, and after the toothbrush was returned to the charger base the fluid would leak out and run down the side of the toothbrush and accumulate between the brush and the base.  You can prevent this by taking off the brush head after each use, shaking the fluid out, blowing into it, etc or just leaving it off in between brushings.  Or of course you can just live with the ring that forms and clean it off every couple days.  Overall this is minor and does not keep me from giving this item a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> I like this toothbrush but it seems to hesitate while it&#x27;s running. I guess I should contact Oral B with my concern.</li>
    <li> This model exceeds the speed of our old Oral-B and uses the same type of brush heads.  I wish that the base without the storage tray (we&#x27;re storing it in a tall cabinet next to the bathroom sink) was a bit more stable.  Overall pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> Cleans well but really have to be careful not to push too hard on your gums.  Otherwise, as advertised and good product generally speaking.</li>
    <li> I had an older model that I broke accidentally. This one is more aggressive and vibrates faster. It has different speeds if you don&#x27;t like the main speed. It is small enough to take on trips easily. Perfect in my book.</li>
    <li> No complaints about the toothbrush.  It works fine.  If you&#x27;re counting the rebate in your overall cost evaluation you will be disappointed.  I submitted mine at the end of March.  It is June now and  the rebate has not arrived.  I called P&amp;G Customer Service.  After waiting on hold for 15 minutes I finally reach a person who only told me \\&quot;it must not be processed yet...call back in a week\\&quot;.  I have seen other posters with the same complaint, so buyer beware!  I would have given a 5-star rating if the rebate had been fulfilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I ended up getting my rebate in mid June after calling P&amp;G again.  I had to e-mail them scanned copies of the original rebate material.  Once they got it, the rebate came right away.  Glad I kept a copy of the rebate material.</li>
    <li> Really like this toothbrush just wished it came with some extra brush heads in the pack.  Other then that it works very well, my mouth feels cleaner and over all i think it was a good investment.</li>
