### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best price I found anywhere on this item.  </li>
      <li>So coming from her, she is very happy and recommends it to you!</li>
      <li>The scent was subtley flowery and very pleasant although one of my kids thought it was \\&quot;yucky smelling&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>and it is great to wear under make up</li>
      <li>Great service as always from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I offered this collection to my friend who uses these kinds of products and given that it was Neutragena, she was happy to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her</li>
      <li>Price is great   </li>
      <li>So doing it once is a great benefit, but if its something you want to do continually, it might strap your budget at some</li>
      <li>Probably not, as it&#x27;s fairly pricey, but I may keep using some form of moisturizer.</li>
      <li>She said it felt good going on and was a good moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line: for the price, these are good products that work well on my oily skin.</li>
      <li>and I thought it did a good job of protecting my fair skin from the sun.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I found this product tastefully packaged and the effects look good.</li>
      <li>, the SPF factor is good...</li>
      <li>I am wondering if this is the same?&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, this does feel really good</li>
      <li>I should note that I&#x27;m 30 and have good, youthful skin, no lines or wrinkles to start off with.    </li>
      <li>and at first that product also was impressive, until I found the softness is a surface effect.</li>
      <li>Granted, to be fair, I have very light skin with some</li>
      <li>I liked the product in that it didn&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction, and the ion serum gel did make my skin feel cleaner.</li>
      <li>She liked the way it felt on her skin.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see any spectacular results while I was using it, and even though I am in the market for a product to use around my eyes, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d stick with this one.</li>
      <li>The lotion was nice, and I like that it has the spf 30.</li>
      <li>The Ion cream felt good going on, but felt like I had to use more than it suggested in order to cover my face and neck areas.</li>
      <li>I would have liked to have used the treatment for four weeks to see if there was any noticeable improvement</li>
      <li>but they were very easy to use.</li>
      <li>It was one of the better rated creams in a popular consumer magazine this month (April 2010).</li>
      <li>So, this at first glance seems like a great alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The company who comes up with a cream that banishes fine lines and wrinkles will rule the world!</li>
      <li>but I am not quite at that stage where I have many lines - just looking to be proactive!&lt;br /&gt;However.</li>
      <li>There is also sunscreen in the product, eliminating the need to add more products to your routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>No, it didn&#x27;t wipe out all my wrinkles (ok I dont have any yet)</li>
      <li>For the price, I would expect a lot more.</li>
      <li>The silver serum is the most interesting of the 3.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache from the smell (which most lotions do).  </li>
      <li>More cons than pros.</li>
      <li>, it makes my skin feel refreshed longer than Olay for sure</li>
      <li>Skin feels strengthened and appears tighter and firmer and more defined.  </li>
      <li>This one hydrates as well as some, not as well as others, but not any better.</li>
      <li>around the eye area looks considerbly better.</li>
      <li>Perhaps there are better results if this product is used for a longer time period.</li>
      <li>I gave it two stars because, while I do not think it met the hype - it is an ok skin cream.  </li>
      <li>Even my Aveda Hydrating Lotion seems to do a better job.</li>
      <li>Should I reinvest in another supply, hoping for better results in a couple weeks?</li>
      <li>her face looks more &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But I like Neutrogena products and have used many of them over the years</li>
      <li>and more our family is becoming &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; in what we eat and use on our bodies.</li>
      <li>There are just two many skin care products out there in this race to win the hearts and dollar$ of the skin conscious set.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t get this in a free trial, like many reviewers, so maybe I gave it more of a chance, having paid for it.</li>
      <li>The eye area is where I have seen the most improvement, in the fine lines that were under my eyes.</li>
      <li>I purchased Neutrogena Clinical for my charming and intelligent wife who unfortunately dark puffy eyes that make her resembles a Dick Tracy villain.  </li>
      <li>but this is great and my skin feels so soft after using it.</li>
      <li>love that while the creams feel like moisturizer when you smooth it on</li>
      <li>/&gt;The serums are really easy to use.</li>
      <li>The directions were easy to follow and it could easily be added to any daytime skincare regimen you are on.</li>
      <li>All three easily blended into my skin.</li>
      <li>results\\&quot; after just one week (and should have been even more pronounced after a full month).  </li>
      <li>results\\&quot; after just one week (and should have been even more pronounced after a full month).  </li>
      <li>I did not see a noticeable reduction in fine lines or wrinkles that the product claims to help with.</li>
      <li>If you are trying to minimize fine lines, this product will not do anything for you.  </li>
      <li>You can use this under your makeup just fine.      </li>
      <li>It quickly disappears into your skin immediately like magic.</li>
      <li>The follow-up SPF cream smelled pleasant and made my skin soft.</li>
      <li>The activating cream has a light, pleasant scent (it fades fairly quickly for those who don&#x27;t like scented items); the cream itself is fairly rich, but again, it is absorbed quickly.  </li>
      <li>I guess if you had a class reunion, wedding or any other special occasion you wanted to look your best this treatment might workout for you, but don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
      <li>The Claim: Neutrogena Clinical Lifting Wrinkle Treatment claims to visibly smooth wrinkles from your skin for a resilient, youthful look.</li>
      <li>Even though I am not getting the same lifting results, I am going to continue using the system, because the difference is not that great.</li>
      <li>The gel serum has a velvety texture and helps makeup go on smooth.</li>
      <li>how smooth my skin felt,</li>
      <li>so silky smooth</li>
      <li>I was using Ole Henriksen truth serum and Ulta primer which felt light and sat well under make-up.</li>
      <li>So if this is important to you, keep looking.</li>
      <li>I trust the Neutrogena brand name and they tend to make products that are good for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Needless to say, we laughed it off and in the end she was pleasantly surprised with the results.  </li>
      <li>It was smooth and felt clean after applying it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to see results and this system is a pretty good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I received my box, I was excited to get started.  </li>
      <li>Maybe more, since I was getting the eye separately at first.</li>
      <li>I will be adding this product to my long term morning routine, I have been really happy with the results.</li>
      <li>The texture is velvety and leaves my skin feeling really great all day long.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So, in the end, the BEST that I can say about this Starter Kit is that it seemed to act as a decent moisturizer during the time I used it (about a month, which is how long the products lasted).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;So, in the end, the BEST that I can say about this Starter Kit is that it seemed to act as a decent moisturizer during the time I used it (about a month, which is how long the products lasted).  </li>
      <li>Follow that up with the face or eye cream that has a creamy texture, but still leaves you feeling clean.  </li>
      <li>I have definitely noticed a pleasant tightness and softness of my face when I touch my skin.</li>
      <li>Clearly, Neutrogena glycerine soap was the go-to skin care product for teens back-in-the-day but those teens are now aging Boomers, who need more help then just a bar of see-through-soap!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Ok, let&#x27;s admit it, we all want a skin care product that is affordable, easy to use and gets the job done right?</li>
      <li>Whether that is the placebo effect because that is what the bottle said it will do or if it&#x27;s really doing it, we aren&#x27;t sure yet.</li>
      <li>I recommend the eye cream, and for that reason, the starter set might be a good initial purchase to see how it works for you.</li>

      <li>the \\&quot;Neutrogena Clinical Lifting Wrinkle System\\&quot; really create more youthful looking skin?</li>
      <li>and i can say that it&#x27;s moisturizer was not bad</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;sunblocky\\&quot; smell was off-putting, and there are so many other products on the market with a more appealing quality to them.</li>
      <li>The second SPF 30 cream is applied on top of the serum and is heavier, doesn&#x27;t do a magic trick like the silver serum</li>
      <li>So, Neutrogena will not be ruling my world at these prices for a product which produces mild results but their glycerin soap is still a winner.</li>
      <li>I tend to use more environmentally and healthy beauty products such as cosmetics without parabens, ect.</li>
      <li>I get more beauty bang for my buck from Philosophy by using their Make-up-Optional skin care kit which last me an entire year for $78! :)or $78! :)</li>
      <li>Not unpleasant and the scent fades quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I do have to say that the packaging is nice and it comes with a handy plastic rack for each small tube to stand upright.</li>
      <li>I certainly would not say that I saw improved skin tone/minimized signs of discoloration or improvement in fine lines/wrinkles, both of which are supposedly \\&quot;clinically proven\\&quot; to be \\&quot;noticeable</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The Claim: Neutrogena Clinical Lifting Wrinkle Treatment claims to visibly smooth wrinkles from your skin for a resilient, youthful look. After using it just once your skin should feel softer and fuller. After one week it claims to lift the look of sagging skin; even skin tone and minimize the signs of discoloration; reduce the appearance of fine lines/wrinkles; and improve the look of facial contours and definition. For your eyes, after one week it claims to reduce the look of puffiness and dark circles; smooth the appearance of crow&#x27;s feet, lines, and wrinkles; and firm and define the appearance of the eye contour area. After two weeks it promises to lift the look of sagging skin around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daily Usage: The Neutrogena Clinical Lifting Wrinkle Treatment System has three items: gel serum, SPF 30 activating cream, and eye activating cream. You use a dime sized amount of the gel over your face and neck; then a dime sized amount of the SPF 30 activating cream to your face and neck; and finally a small amount of the eye activating cream to your entire eye area. The tube and bottles are small and I was a bit afraid of using too much but they were very easy to use. All three easily blended into my skin. My one issue with the three items is that the SPF 30 did indeed smell like suntan lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it Work?: Of the three items, I felt immediate results from the gel - my skin did feel softer and smoother. As I mentioned, the SPF 30 smelled a bit too much like suntan lotion. I honestly did not notice any improvement around my eyes which are prone to dark circles. I would have liked to have used the treatment for four weeks to see if there was any noticeable improvement but unfortunately I developed an allergic reaction and had to stop using it after a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom-line: Neutrogena Clinical Lifting Wrinkle Treatment may work for some people but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Being a productophile, I&#x27;m willing to try almost anything that promises that elusive fountain of youth, especially around my eyes.  This product not only promises it but espouses to know the proven technology that will restore my skin&#x27;s \\&quot;positive ion flow\\&quot; to help rebuild  its lost collagen levels.  I figured, \\&quot;why not?\\&quot;  It can&#x27;t be any worse than a vibrating mascara brush!      When I opened up the package (it comes in much too much packaging along with everything else on this earth) to reveal an intimidating set of three products that are supposed to work cooperatively with each other.  My initial shock was not warranted though, I use all three similar products daily anyway; a gel serum, moisturizer, and an eye moisturizer.  I didn&#x27;t really understand why the moisturizers are called \\&quot;activating cream\\&quot;(s) though.  The first step is a \\&quot;gel serum\\&quot; that comes out grey but disappeared upon massaging it into my skin.  It left my face VERY soft and had no noticeable odor but it left my face looking matte and dull; a bit grey as a matter of fact.  The next step is an \\&quot;activating cream\\&quot;.  The scent was subtley flowery and very pleasant although one of my kids thought it was \\&quot;yucky smelling&#x27;.  I hoped it would perk up my complexion a bit that the grey \\&quot;gel serum\\&quot; created but it did not.  The final step is the \\&quot;eye activating cream.\\&quot;  I have tried bazillions of different eye creams and none hydrates as well or for as long as I would like.  This one hydrates as well as some, not as well as others, but not any better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy in my early 50&#x27;s and when this came up as an option for a Vine review selection, and there wasn&#x27;t anything else I really wanted instead, I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot and see what happened. I have fairly young-looking skin for my age due to a complexion that used to be pretty oily, though no longer.    I was prepared to use it once and toss it, as I hate oily-feeling creams and the like, but this stuff isn&#x27;t like that. There are 3 creams and none feels oily and they disappear after rubbing them in. I assume I&#x27;m using them correctly, but the instructions are pretty minimal. (On the other hand, how elaborate should they be...)    Since I don&#x27;t normally use anything on my face, I can&#x27;t compare this to anything else, but I&#x27;ve noticed that my crow&#x27;s feet seem less obvious in the 3 weeks I&#x27;ve been using this stuff. I don&#x27;t have before/after photos, but I looked pretty carefully before I started using this.    Will I keep it up after the starter kit is over? Probably not, as it&#x27;s fairly pricey, but I may keep using some form of moisturizer.</li>
    <li> When I first got the product I was taken aback by how large the packaging was, and then how small the actual product was. More than a month later and I still have product to use! I was really surprised. It doesn&#x27;t take much to see results and this system is a pretty good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serums are really easy to use. Its not a complicated process and I only had to read the instructions once. The texture is velvety and leaves my skin feeling really great all day long. I like that it has SPF built in, that eliminates adding another product to my morning routine. This wears nicely under makeup and doesn&#x27;t interfere with makeup application, simply wait 5 minutes while you brush your teeth and then go right ahead and apply makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin really does feel firmer and somewhat lifted. I noticed a healthy glow after a few days of use. I will be adding this product to my long term morning routine, I have been really happy with the results.</li>
    <li> This is going to be a relatively short review because there&#x27;s not a lot to say about it.  The short of it is that there was no visible improvement other than what near-term improvement that you&#x27;re going to see using any sort of lotion on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 3 stars for \\&quot;the benefit of the doubt\\&quot;.  But I personally wouldn&#x27;t buy the stuff.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much, if anything.  Of course, according to the manufacturer, something like 91% apparently noticed improvement, so if that&#x27;s true, I&#x27;m obviously in the minority,</li>
    <li> I purchased Neutrogena Clinical for my charming and intelligent wife who unfortunately dark puffy eyes that make her resembles a Dick Tracy villain.  (You know which one.)  After a week of regular use her results were very slight.  When she reached the 4 week bench mark, the puffiness did reseed but quickly came back in a couple of days.  I guess if you had a class reunion, wedding or any other special occasion you wanted to look your best this treatment might workout for you, but don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this four stars because even after a week I can see that the crow&#x27;s feet under my eyes are tightening up. However, some of the cons tend to balance this out:    Pro  *Although it&#x27;s pricey, they pretty much swear you will see results in a month, so it&#x27;s not a huge investment financially or timewise to see if it works for you.    *The creams smell like expensive salon products, so you&#x27;ll feel/smell pampered at your bathroom sink.      *My skin definitely looks brighter to me. Having said that, my 7-year-old asked me yesterday if it was hand cream. When I explained what the product was for and asked if I looked any younger, she could not stop laughing and yelled \\&quot;No!\\&quot; So, out of the mouths of babes. You probably won&#x27;t get any miracles out of this.     *Psychologically, I think if you&#x27;re going to spend time dabbing goo on your face each and every day, you&#x27;re probably going to take care of yourself in other ways: flossing, going to the gym, etc. So in general, it may prompt you to engage in self-care.    *One of the tubes contains sunblock (I believe---see \\&quot;con\\&quot; comment regarding lack of info. on the tubes), so you automatically get that benefit (although it&#x27;s hard to believe there could be enough protection from such a small dab of cream).     *There&#x27;s a cute little plastic holder to store your tubes in and they don&#x27;t take up much room.     Con  *It&#x27;s expensive and the bottles are miniscule. They are meant to last a month (I can&#x27;t verify if they do, but I have been skipping my neck, because I suspect they do not). This means that if you were to keep buying the program, you&#x27;d be shelling out close to half a grand a year. By comparison, my eighty-year-old aunties don&#x27;t look a day over sixty, and they&#x27;ve never used anything but Noxema. So you may be able to achieve the same results for a lot less.    *One of the creams is grey. It does not feel natural to spread grey goo on your face. Also, it has a weird plastic feel, almost like a face mask product. This allbrings me to the next point:    *As another reviewer noted, this is not an organic product. So if this is important to you, keep looking. Basically, you&#x27;re putting chemicals on your skin, which does not appeal to me over the long-term.     *There aren&#x27;t many instructions on the tubes (because they&#x27;re so small), so unless you memorize the \\&quot;instructions\\&quot; on the box, you&#x27;re pretty much on your own. It seems to me the box called this a \\&quot;starter kit,\\&quot; which implies that we should be moving on to something else after a month, or maybe a set of larger tubes, but my DH threw out the box, so again, no more info.     Bottom line: If you are interested, try it. One month won&#x27;t break the bank. However, although I like it, I suspect I&#x27;ll be moving on when the tubes run out, based on cost if nothing else.</li>
    <li> I spent several weeks trying this product.  I gave it two stars because, while I do not think it met the hype - it is an ok skin cream.  Today, I went back to my all natural skin cream and the red areas on my face caused by this product are already going away.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, so perhaps someone else might find it a better moisture system than I did.  It left my skin feeling slightly greasy and attracted more dust, pollen, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happily paying twice the amount for something more natural.</li>
    <li> I have an automatic skeptical response when a marketing campaign touts the products ability to create a \\&quot;positive electric micro-current\\&quot; to \\&quot;minimize the visible signs of collagen loss\\&quot;. But I like Neutrogena products and have used many of them over the years so I wanted to see what they came up with and give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;The grey serum feels like applying fine powder on the skin and is almost unscented. The SPF #30 day cream and eye cream smell like vanilla scented candles to me. Not unpleasant and the scent fades quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I love that while the creams feel like moisturizer when you smooth it on but they dry to a matte finish that does not turn into a greasy layer after several hours. My skin looks good without makeup and it also makes a great base for the matte brush-on foundation that I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: after 4 weeks my overall skin appearance has improved. It looks and feels smoother and my pores seem less visible. I have some fine lines around my eye that have been softened slightly but are certainly still there. You do need very little of the product per application which is good because the size of the containers are so small; .5 ounce of the gel serum, .33 oz of the day cream and .17 oz of the eye cream. It comes packaged with a holder that makes it easy to store and retrieve the little tubes. I did post a picture showing the holder and a quarter for scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bummer: The little tubes lasted a month so you would have to purchase this product 12 times in a year making it inconvenient and expensive. When you consider how much packaging would be required for one persons one year supply it becomes even less attractive. I wish they had taken that into consideration when developing this product.</li>
    <li> For the price, I would expect a lot more. I didn&#x27;t see any spectacular results while I was using it, and even though I am in the market for a product to use around my eyes, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d stick with this one. The \\&quot;sunblocky\\&quot; smell was off-putting, and there are so many other products on the market with a more appealing quality to them. Even my Aveda Hydrating Lotion seems to do a better job.</li>
    <li> I am surprised that this product isn&#x27;t getting more play in the magazines, as I feel it works very well. The packaging is annoying I agree, and the top coat outlasts the serum. But I saw and continue to see results and that&#x27;s what counts. Right away, it&#x27;s very softening. I decided to just use it during the day, as I have many other products I already like for night. I didn&#x27;t get this in a free trial, like many reviewers, so maybe I gave it more of a chance, having paid for it. I always find a sale and the boxes usually include coupons, there are rebates available and I have yet to pay full price and I&#x27;m on my 5th or so purchase. Maybe more, since I was getting the eye separately at first. The eye area is where I have seen the most improvement, in the fine lines that were under my eyes. My crow&#x27;s feet weren&#x27;t too bad in the first place, but I believe they are a little smoother. Nothing previously though, seemed to have much effect on my undereye area, and I also think I look more \\&quot;awake\\&quot; in general, smoother lids.  Maybe there was some lift, it&#x27;s very hard to tell precisely sometimes, where and what is making you look better. I&#x27;ve had no negative reactions to the product.  I have decided to space this out, now that I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months, by using it every other day, partially because I have seen results and want to use it in conjunction with some other new products out there, and partly because I think that since it works to stimulate collegen growth, ones skin might get used to the little \\&quot;shocks\\&quot; it causes and the reaction might decrease. So I&#x27;ll be watching to see if I keep the progress made so far.</li>
    <li> I read other reviews, so I thought I would try it, it is expensive and the size of the product is too small, if you get four weeks out of it you will be lucky use sparingly. [...] That night I washed and dried my face applied the nightime serum and cream felt good, the next two days I did the same thing I applied the daytime and eye serum and cream, in the afternoon my face was dry, itchy, redness around my chin and cheeks, eye area was fine day. I have problems with fine lines, wrinkles, and dry skin, this product added to the dryness. I would not recommend this product. Now I need to go out and find a moisturizer for the dryness. More cons than pros.</li>
    <li> The company who comes up with a cream that banishes fine lines and wrinkles will rule the world! Neutrogena entered the skin care game in 1962 with that little famous glycerine bar that I could not live without. Neutrogena has recently upped their skin care game with the introduction of, \\&quot;Neutrogena Clinical Lifting Wrinkle Treatment System\\&quot;. Clearly, Neutrogena glycerine soap was the go-to skin care product for teens back-in-the-day but those teens are now aging Boomers, who need more help then just a bar of see-through-soap! Riding to the rescue is a trusted skin care company with their new patented skin care product. Will Neutrogena rule the world?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, let&#x27;s admit it, we all want a skin care product that is affordable, easy to use and gets the job done right? There are just two many skin care products out there in this race to win the hearts and dollar$ of the skin conscious set. When one comes around that claims to be a \\&quot;revolution\\&quot; that will anti-age us, do we melt? No, we&#x27;ve heard all these claims before, shelled out the money and have been disappointed that a drugstore skin cream did not make us look younger! Our quest to anti-age ourselves will no doubt continue and skin care companies know there is gold in them there skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will a $50 ($38 at Amazon)trial-size product be able to turn back the clock? Probably not (sigh) but I did like a few things about this Neutrogena&#x27;s new product. First, let&#x27;s break this system down. There are 3 tubes, a silver colored activating serum (which boast the \\&quot;patented\\&quot; ion 2complex label),  the SPF 30 activating cream and lastly the ion2 eye cream. If you need more scientific explanations of the ion 2 complex, the Neutrogena site contains this information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is simple to use. It&#x27;s a one,two,three application. The silver serum is the most interesting of the 3. It quickly disappears into your skin immediately like magic. The second SPF 30 cream is applied on top of the serum and is heavier, doesn&#x27;t do a magic trick like the silver serum but it&#x27;s equally assimilated into the skin. Lastly, you apply the eye cream around the outer eye area which also disappears quickly but... I did get it too close to the corner of my eye one time and it caused my eye to water all day and through-out the night so be careful when applying that one! My bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does the \\&quot;Neutrogena Clinical Lifting Wrinkle System\\&quot; really create more youthful looking skin? I wish I could say a resounding, \\&quot;Yes\\&quot; and make every woman over a certain age giddy but results were mild and for $50, what can one expect? I give high marks for the SPF 30 cream though. I walk (miles) every day out in the sun and I thought it did a good job of protecting my fair skin from the sun. I tested it while visiting Washington DC when temps were in the 90&#x27;s recently and the sun was unbearable. It held up all day and I has no sun affects at the end of a very long day in that sun drenched cement city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, to be fair, I only used this one tiny trial set. Perhaps there are better results if this product is used for a longer time period. Neutrogena does claim that results will be seen in only \\&quot;4 weeks\\&quot;. In addition, I only have the \\&quot;Day\\&quot; set and there is a \\&quot;Night\\&quot; set as well. I would not use the Day-set at night due to the SPF 30 but maybe the 4 week results claim is determined by someone using both sets exclusively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final comments are about the price of this product. In this economy, we are all price conscious and a lot of people will not be able to plunk down $50 for this starter kit which only last for one month. Buying this product from Amazon would be a wise decision at only $38 because even Walmart charges $48 for the tiny starter-kit! So, Neutrogena will not be ruling my world at these prices for a product which produces mild results but their glycerin soap is still a winner. I get more beauty bang for my buck from Philosophy by using their Make-up-Optional skin care kit which last me an entire year for $78! :)or $78! :)</li>
    <li> My partner agreed to test this product for me, and we shared our observations, which were very similar. It does seem to make the skin *feel* smoother, and she liked that, but as she pointed out, almost any facial cream will do the same, and for far less money, of course.  If you badly want to see fewer or more shallow wrinkles, you probably will, but if the difference isn&#x27;t entirely an illusion, it&#x27;s certainly far from dramatic; I told her I frankly wouldn&#x27;t have noticed if she hadn&#x27;t mentioned she&#x27;d been using something new, and she agreed that any actual wrinkle reduction was very hard to discern.  She noted that care must be taken to make sure you don&#x27;t get any of the eye cream in your eye, because it&#x27;s pretty unpleasant when you do, but that aside, both of us did notice a slight improvement in the appearance of the darkness under her eyes--but this seemed purely on the surface; as soon as she stopped using it, the \\&quot;results\\&quot; evaporated, we agreed.      As a guy who didn&#x27;t personally use the product, I hesitate to say more, but I&#x27;ll say this: if you&#x27;re looking for actual, significant wrinkle reduction, in my observation this is a waste of money.  If you&#x27;re looking to feel a little pampered, and are satisfied with any kind of improvement you can get, however temporary, this product costs a lot more than ordinary skin lotions, but a lot less than many products that I&#x27;m guessing don&#x27;t do much more.</li>
    <li> Having used Neutrogena products and recommended them to others, this is the first time I&#x27;ve been disappointed with both price and performance. With this new line of products, my trust in the manufacturer has diminished. It may work for others, but I found the claims to be quite exaggerated.  Used morning and night for 3-1/2 weeks, just this morning got my last squeeze from the serum gel tubes (visualize a teensy toothpaste tube...) so it really was insufficient product to last me a full month. Should I reinvest in another supply, hoping for better results in a couple weeks? Ahh, that is the question!!    First thing that made me hesitate to buy first time around was how expensive the product is for the amount you get. The package is BIG, with hard plastic inside and paper outside. Shame on me for letting my environmental conscience be overruled by promises of a revolutionary way to happier skin. One claim for the product is semi-true; skin feels soft...note the operative word here is &#x27;feels.&#x27; The gel serum has a velvety texture and helps makeup go on smooth. I&#x27;ve used a similar product, DHC Velvet Skin Coat, which feels exactly the same way and at first that product also was impressive, until I found the softness is a surface effect. It would seem Neutrogena didn&#x27;t invent something magical and new, though the color is different.    My skin is sad to report no significant improvement over other products I&#x27;ve used. And if time is a factor, applying two layers of product takes twice as long. So my decision about buying a new supply? You guessed it.</li>
    <li> Now in my early 40s, I am lucky enough to have no major problems with wrinkles so far, although of course, some aging is beginning to show.  However, I was mainly interested in this Starter System for the inclusion of an Eye product.  I struggle with dark under eye circles, and according to the box, the eye cream included in this kit is \\&quot;clinically proven\\&quot; to produce \\&quot;noticeable improvement\\&quot; in reducing puffiness and dark circles by the end of one week; by the end of four weeks, these results are supposed to increase to \\&quot;significantly noticeable.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I began using this system about a month prior to my 42nd birthday.  There are three total products:  1) a serum, which is supposed to be applied over the face, neck, and entire eye area, 2) an activating cream, also designed to be applied over the entire face and neck, and 3) an eye activating cream, designed to be used around the entire eye area.  The instructions did not specify exactly when to apply the products, but because the activating cream was labeled \\&quot;Day\\&quot; and contained SPF, I choose to use this regimen in the A.M. only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here were my initial impressions:&lt;br /&gt;The serum comes out of the tube a medium gray color, which seems a bit odd at first, but it does disappear into the skin.  It has a silky feel but seems to be easily absorbed.  The activating cream has a light, pleasant scent (it fades fairly quickly for those who don&#x27;t like scented items); the cream itself is fairly rich, but again, it is absorbed quickly.  The eye cream, on the other other hand, is significantly thinner, which was unexpected (I would have thought it would be the other way around).  I preferred the pumps of the two creams to the serum&#x27;s tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I LIKED:&lt;br /&gt;All three products seemed to absorb into my skin well, and they didn&#x27;t leave my oily-prone skin feeling greasy (although I used the products during the spring; it may have been different in the summer).  Similarly, I didn&#x27;t seem to break out any more often than normal while using this system.  My skin generally felt fairly smooth and looked decent in appearance for the duration that I sampled this kit, although I did get some dryness around my mouth towards the end of the month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I DIDN&#x27;T LIKE:&lt;br /&gt;First, I began running out of the serum before the other two products.  I emailed the Neutrogena web site, and they replied to say that I could continue using the other two products alone and still see \\&quot;some effects.\\&quot;  But this leads to my second complaint:  I didn&#x27;t see ANY noticeable effects!  Yes, my skin generally felt soft, but no more so than from using any good moisturizer.  I certainly would not say that I saw improved skin tone/minimized signs of discoloration or improvement in fine lines/wrinkles, both of which are supposedly \\&quot;clinically proven\\&quot; to be \\&quot;noticeable results\\&quot; after just one week (and should have been even more pronounced after a full month).  Similarly, I can&#x27;t say that I saw any of the other claimed benefits of this system, such as lifting the look of sagging skin and improving the look of facial contours/and definition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in the end, the BEST that I can say about this Starter Kit is that it seemed to act as a decent moisturizer during the time I used it (about a month, which is how long the products lasted).  But there is no way I can recommend paying this much for a set of three products that promises so much more; there are certainly better and less expensive moisturizers out there.ore often than normal while using this system.

    <li> I bought this recently, encouraged by the mail in rebate. I am one of those folks that is somewhat sceptical of more expensive creams (even though this at $20 is barely touching the premium market) as my mum and grandmother (a mere 94) both have amazing skin which is probably a combination of genetics, lack of sun (they live in the UK) and a lifelong use of Oil of Olay - hence this has always been my product of choice and I find it works well on my skin which can be a little dry!&lt;br /&gt;I gave this a go and noticed the difference at once - on how smooth my skin felt, no so sure I can see any major line difference but I am not quite at that stage where I have many lines - just looking to be proactive!&lt;br /&gt;However. Here is my issue - as another reviewer brought up, the tubes are designed to be used together - instructions state to use \\&quot;a dime size\\&quot; amount of the gray serum followed by the white lotion - but after about 10 days use the gray cream has all gone, leaving me with the white lotion that simply feels like a standard moisturizer with some SPF  - I have plenty left but gone is the smooth feeling and quite frankly this does not feel particularly moisturizing! I am not so sure why they would design this system to be used together but not supply enough of one component.&lt;br /&gt;Also the gray cream - while it feels great - feels a lot like those make up primers made by companies such as Smashbox and those sort of products are designed to have a topical effect - smoothing out lines for the time in which they are worn, but the effects go when the product is washed off...I am wondering if this is the same?&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, this does feel really good and it is great to wear under make up, the SPF factor is good...but why the heck the lack of one component? This kills the usefulness for me</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a cheap system and the quantities included are minuscule and will probably last a month or so. Didn&#x27;t really notice any extra skin firmness or diminished wrinkles and I stopped using it fairly quickly since I developed some redness and irritation.</li>
    <li> I bought because I ran out of MK the one i always use and i can say that it&#x27;s moisturizer was not bad, it makes my skin feel refreshed longer than Olay for sure and I have a dry skin.</li>
    <li> I dont normally by OTC cosmetics... but this is great and my skin feels so soft after using it.</li>
    <li> Price is great   In usual shop it cost $40 ..     Inside you find 10 percent discount card..  so I bought additional tube in wallmart with 10% off</li>
    <li> Review from the Mrs.:    As a full-time working mom of two rambunctious kids, I was intrigued by the concept of zapping my cells to bring back my youthful glow. As a biological researcher, I was skeptical at the claims of this product.  Still, I decided to run my own experiment and blindly give it a try.   The ion2 complex gel serum was like smoothing on velvet (they do point out that the grey colored gel fades away instantly so you aren&#x27;t alarmed).  The follow-up SPF cream smelled pleasant and made my skin soft. The eye cream was cool on my tired skin. I followed this regimen daily for 3.5 weeks, and took before and after pictures.  Here are my results:    Skin - softer  Skin tone - no noticeable difference  Eyelid wrinkles - no noticeable difference  Puffiness under eyes - no noticeable difference  Definition of eye area - no noticeable difference  Neck wrinkles - possible slight difference    Then I researched online for any scientific data that supported that increasing cell-to-cell communication would stimulate skin repair, or that ion flow in the skin would reduce collagen breakdown. I did not find anything.   Although this was not a full-fledged scientific experiment by any means, my initial conclusion would be that I would get the same result from a $4 sunscreen/moisturizer ($6 for a better smelling one) and drinking an extra glass of water a day, at least in my case.   On the other hand, maybe I just need to use this product longer to see better results. I do have to say that the packaging is nice and it comes with a handy plastic rack for each small tube to stand upright.</li>
    <li> Saw this item and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Being around 40 now my skin doesn&#x27;t seem to be as elastic as it once was and I certainly have wrinkles around my eyes and mouth as well as my forehead.  When I first opened the gel I was a bit surprised by its gray color, but it did go on smooth and made my skin seem soft.  I used it as suggested for 1 month, and while I could tell that I had it on and my skin felt soft to the touch I did not see a noticeable reduction in fine lines or wrinkles that the product claims to help with. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product as a wrinkle treatment.</li>
    <li> I liked the product in that it didn&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction, and the ion serum gel did make my skin feel cleaner. The lotion was nice, and I like that it has the spf 30. It&#x27;s one way for me to follow my doctor&#x27;s recommendation that I wear sunblock daily. However, I never noticed any difference in the lines I have (\\&quot;crows feet\\&quot; and lines between my eyebrows). I&#x27;m not one to be fussed about wrinkles anyway so perhaps that could affect my impression of how well the product works or not.    So would I buy it? Probably not, since wrinkle treatment is not a priority for me. But I would definitely look for and buy Neutrogena facial lotion with the spf sunblock. Skin cancer issues run in my family so I&#x27;m interested in lotion that protects my skin and does not cause an allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> After using this product for about three weeks, I have noticed a difference around my aging eyes and smile line.  It might just be psychological, but I do feel a firmness in both places.  The cream has a light and attactive scent that will not compete with other products in your normal routine, though I do recommend waiting a couple minutes from application to putting on any foundation to avoid mixing the two products.  There is also sunscreen in the product, eliminating the need to add more products to your routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tubes are pretty small, but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Best price I found anywhere on this item.  Great service as always from Amazon.  Haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to evaluate it&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at a local retail store a couple of days ago. I tried it out tonight. The Ion cream felt good going on, but felt like I had to use more than it suggested in order to cover my face and neck areas. The activating face cream felt very greasy and immediately started to make my face itchy and caused a stinging sensation!    I applied the activating eye serum and it really bothered my eyes, causing them to water excessively and sting! I had to wash my face again in order to stop the burning and eye watering! The fragrance is another turn off, those of us with sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to breakouts don&#x27;t need that! I&#x27;ve never had a product do this to my face! I&#x27;m returning it tomorrow and trying something different. I do not recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> The first time I tried this product, I noticed immediately that I could feel the eye cream working.  No, it didn&#x27;t wipe out all my wrinkles (ok I dont have any yet) but I can feel why this product would work - I could feel the cream tightening up the skin under my eyes.  It was a very strange  sensation.    The entire package consists of three items  - the base serum, which goes on so silky smooth it&#x27;s hard to believe it is a cream.  It is very light, and you only use a tiny bit.  It starts out a light grey color but the color does not show up on your skin.  Over the serum you add the face lotion and under-eye cream.  You can use this under your makeup just fine.      My only gripe is the cost, but I notice that similar products on the shelves today cost just as much.  I trust the Neutrogena brand name and they tend to make products that are good for sensitive skin.  I have a lot of skin allergies but I didnt&#x27; have any problems  with it.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this for 3½ weeks now and she likes it.  She seemed to notice the most improvement after a week and then little improvement from that point on.  The box says to use it for 4 weeks.  She said it felt good going on and was a good moisturizer.  That said, it doesn&#x27;t work miracles and she said it does not work as well as Retin-A cream, which requires a prescription.  You cannot use Retin-A on your eyes but you can use this and it includes SPF-40 sunscreen so those are both pluses.  It is rather expensive but it may be worth trying.  Just don&#x27;t expect miracles.  It was one of the better rated creams in a popular consumer magazine this month (April 2010).</li>
    <li> From my wife:  \\&quot;Love this product mostly because I have sensitive skin (even at 35 yrs old) and am also sensitive to fragrances...This trio is soft and gentle to my skin, not too oily and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, so my skin looks and feels fresh...and it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache from the smell (which most lotions do).  Neutrogena, thank you!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on a daily basis and have it found to be very satisfactory.  I have seen a definite improvement to my skin...</li>
    <li> ~&lt;br /&gt;I have always liked the Neutrogena products that I&#x27;ve purchased and used in the past, so when I saw this anti-wrinkle product on the Vine list, I was more than willing to give it a go. I&#x27;m over 40, and like most women and men my age, I&#x27;m trying to hang on to any signs of youthfulness for as long as I can.&lt;br /&gt;When I received my box, I was excited to get started.  Upon opening the box, I found 3 very small containers and some simple and scant instructions.  In generally, this is a 3 step procedure.  The first step is the application of a gray, patented ion2 complex gel serum (whatever that is).  The second step, to be applied immediately after the gel serum, is the layer of the SPF30 activating cream, which causes the gel serum to activate its magic. The 3rd and final step is to dab the eye activating cream to the eye area.&lt;br /&gt;The inside cover of the box says that after just one single use your skin will feel softer and smoother.  This was true, after one application my skin did feel soft and smooth.  However it didn&#x27;t feel any softer or smoother than it does after 1 application of any other brand facial moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;The inside cover of the box says that after 4 weeks, skin&#x27;s natural surface cellular renewal process is enhanced to reveal noticeable younger, more toned, and resilient skin. Skin feels strengthened and appears tighter and firmer and more defined.  Um, not really.  Okay, my skin doesn&#x27;t look worse than it did 4 weeks ago, but nobody has commented on how much younger I look now than I did last month, and tonight when I went out to dinner with my husband, the waitress did not ask for my I.D. before bringing me a glass of wine. Nor do I think that my skin looks any younger, tighter, or firmer, than it did last month.&lt;br /&gt;So, in the end...this may be a decent facial sun screen/moisturizer, but I did not see any less fine lines after using it consistently for over four weeks.</li>
    <li> I ve been using this product for about a week now and it defenitely is reducing the appearance of little lines and softening the deeper wrinkles.. around the eye area looks considerbly better. I will continue to use this product, because it works</li>
    <li> I cant really give this a helpful review as I had to stop using it as I found the daytime moisturizer too greasy. I did not use it long enough to give it a thumbs up or down. The directions were easy to follow and it could easily be added to any daytime skincare regimen you are on. Cant say if it really helps your wrinkles.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this and her face feels silky and softer to my touch.&lt;br /&gt;The bottles are tiny, so I was worried that the cost would be high if she had to buy this every few weeks. As it goes, this looks like it will last approx 2 months, even with every day use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But. . .the eye cream instructions say &amp;#34;dab a small amount&amp;#34;. The problem is the pump dispenser always shoots out a &#x27;glob&#x27; of cream and since it&#x27;s a pump you can&#x27;t put the excess back in the container. Thus, a non-pump dispenser would be much better otherwise the eye cream will run out long before the rest of the kit does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as tightening and &amp;#34;lifting&amp;#34; of the skin, she is noticing a slight positive difference. Whether that is the placebo effect because that is what the bottle said it will do or if it&#x27;s really doing it, we aren&#x27;t sure yet. If it really does firm up, then I&#x27;m sure there is a market out there for gallon size bottles that allow liberal application to underarms and belly. (I&#x27;m just kidding of course, but you know you thought it too)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think in the time she&#x27;s been using this product her face looks more &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More and more our family is becoming &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; in what we eat and use on our bodies. This would be my main concern with any of these products, Neutrogena or any other brand. The fact that most of the ingredients are too difficult to pronounce or not labeled at all (then again the bottles are tiny) is a cause of concern in today&#x27;s day &amp; age. Without further research I&#x27;d be concerned about such things listed as: Avobenzone, Homosalate, Octisalate, Octocrylene and Oxybenzone. Those might be totally harmless ingredients but it does cause one to pause and take note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Neutrogena product felt like it was trying to directly compete with some of the &amp;#34;classy&amp;#34; Oil of Olay options. This is a turn of events or me because I only associate Neutrogena with those model/celebrity soap commercials. I wouldn&#x27;t have thought they did good moisturizing products like the other competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, if the cost isn&#x27;t prohibitive and you can use sparingly, then you&#x27;ll get a few months of a great softer feeling before it&#x27;s time to stock up again.commercials.

    <li> I admit I was skeptical, I&#x27;ve been using a much more expensive anti-wrinkle/lifting serum. Economic times being what they are, I needed to find something more reasonably priced. I&#x27;ve been using the Neutrogena products for two months now, and I find the results to be similar to the more expensive serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like: SPF in product; anti-wrinkle treatment is as effective as similar higher-priced products; the feel of the products on my skin, which is very oily - these products do not make that worse as some creams can do; skin brightening results are similar to higher-priced products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like: the lifting properties do not have the same effectiveness as higher-priced products although I do see fairly good results; the one tube (instead of a pump) that makes it difficult to control how much product comes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: for the price, these are good products that work well on my oily skin. Even though I am not getting the same lifting results, I am going to continue using the system, because the difference is not that great.</li>
    <li> Having tried some of the most expensive skin care brands available, I have come to the conclusion that Neutrogena offers the most for the money, and compares quite favorably to skin care products that cost four or five times more.  Though this is an expensive set for Neutrogena, itis a great collection.  The first step has an incredible texture - it is a grey cream that goes on your skin totally dry, leaving it feeling supple yet not greasy at all. Follow that up with the face or eye cream that has a creamy texture, but still leaves you feeling clean.  My one big complaint, the sizes are quite small.  You will like the feeling and use it up in no time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still young enough that I definitely have no need to run out to the store for StriVectin, but at the same time I cycle long distances and the sun and wind take their toll. Genetically, I have dark under eye circles coupled with very thin skin there that drives me up a wall. I use MAC eye cream, which contains caffeine. However the price tab for that teeny tiny tube is hard to swallow. So, this at first glance seems like a great alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Sun block - granted it&#x27;s only SPF 15&lt;br /&gt;2) Softens skin&lt;br /&gt;3) Eye cream works comparably well to my MAC cream&lt;br /&gt;4) Price&lt;br /&gt;5) I like the holder - it&#x27;s unobtrusive but neat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) I broke out! I never get pimples EVER - however, three weeks in and my skin was blotchy and I had pimples on my forehead and cheeks. I stopped for two days and my normal color returned, resumed...the blotching returned too. So, I had to stop using the face cream for this reason (eye cream okay, so it is definitely the face activating cream)&lt;br /&gt;2) It smells like perfume - I&#x27;m pretty scent sensitive, I hate it&lt;br /&gt;3) The whole apply one first then apply an activating cream gets old&lt;br /&gt;4) You have to use very little or the grey cream seems to pill up under make-up&lt;br /&gt;5) Instructions are shoddy - can I use it with primer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think it has worked remarkably well for tightening the skin under my eyes and reducing the appearance of dark circles. However, I don&#x27;t think it did anything on my face (before the blotching); it may not have been long enough. I do not think it sat under my make-up well either. It just didn&#x27;t absorb well. I was using Ole Henriksen truth serum and Ulta primer which felt light and sat well under make-up. I feel like this is heavy no matter how thing I try and spread it, and makes my make-up gummy and less attractive. Granted, to be fair, I have very light skin with some freckling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did actually buy a new tube of the eye cream (Neutrogena has a rebate too, through 4/30/10). I plan on using it daily and saving the MAC cream for the weekends/special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: 4.5 stars for the eye cream, 2 stars for the face cream, Approx -.5 stars for having the two-step process. Some tightening and reduction of under eye circles with the eye cream. No improvement or tightening noted with the face cream - actually seemed to make forehead worry lines and laugh lines worse under make-up. Developed a sensitivity to the face cream (possibly due to the perfume?). I recommend the eye cream, and for that reason, the starter set might be a good initial purchase to see how it works for you.for the weekends/special occasions.

    <li> Wrinkle treatments are popular items in the cosmetic world and its tough to determine what \\&quot;really\\&quot; works verse what gives the illusion its working. I offered this collection to my friend who uses these kinds of products and given that it was Neutragena, she was happy to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her response after the initial 2 weeks were positive. She liked the way it felt on her skin. No residue or oily feeling. It was smooth and felt clean after applying it. She stated that she could see her skin work from application. But it does need continual use for to maximize the effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest con of the product is that for the price you are getting small amounts. Granted you are not using high doses, but lets face it, they are giving you about a months supply. So doing it once is a great benefit, but if its something you want to do continually, it might strap your budget at some point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I found this product tastefully packaged and the effects look good. The biggest consideration in purchasing this is the cost.</li>
    <li> and thought I&#x27;d get this for my wife to try.  Of course there was no hidden agenda or meaning behind me giving this to her, but for brief second, it was kind of awkward when I told her I got her some wrinkle cream... :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, we laughed it off and in the end she was pleasantly surprised with the results.  So coming from her, she is very happy and recommends it to you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 5 1/2 weeks now and I can&#x27;t say that there has been much difference. I have definitely noticed a pleasant tightness and softness of my face when I touch my skin. That&#x27;s good, but I&#x27;ve had four or five minor blemishes which isn&#x27;t normal for me and on my left cheek where I sometimes have redness using this kit has actually made the redness a bit more pronounced, not taken it away. I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in the eye area. I should note that I&#x27;m 30 and have good, youthful skin, no lines or wrinkles to start off with.    I tend to use more environmentally and healthy beauty products such as cosmetics without parabens, ect. I didn&#x27;t like that I get a definite smell of like motor oil or something from a garage when I use the gel serum. I thought it might just be me so I had my husband sniff it and he smelled the same thing. I do like that the moisturizer has spf 30 in it and it is very moisturizing. But I can&#x27;t say that I would get this again.</li>
    <li> Without a doubt this cream works on deep wrinkles.  In order to continue to see results you do have to apply it daily/weekly, so that can be time consuming. If you are trying to minimize fine lines, this product will not do anything for you.  It&#x27;s a little pricy.</li>
