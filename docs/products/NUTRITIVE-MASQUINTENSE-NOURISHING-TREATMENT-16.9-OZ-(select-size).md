<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have a normal amount of hair but it very fine. Kerastase left my hair silky but now weighed down. I have been using Paul Mitchell but this is better.</li>
    <li> I had a salon use this once and I am glad I purchased it. My hair looks and feels great!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product or years. Just love it. I always buy them in bulk when I visit Paris, I ran out and went to buy one from a beauty supply store in Los Angeles. They wanted $65 for it. I was shocked since I have always bought these for around 30 euros. I am glad I checked amazon before giving them my credit card.</li>
    <li> I got this conditioning masque, along with the shampoo and serum, as a gift from my in-laws, and good lord, I love it! It leaves my hair soooo soft! I only need a little bit, like a quarter sized dollop for my long hair, and it makes my hair feel amazing! Went to the beach last week, then straight to the mall; by the time I got home, my hair was a straw-like mess! Super dry and yucky! After using this it was soft and manageable and shiny! All in all, I loooove this masque, and will be very sad when it runs out, since I can&#x27;t really afford to shell out so much for a conditioner, no matter how amazing it is. However, if you can afford it, GET IT!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner, hands down. I&#x27;ve tried others, I try others to mix and confuse my hair into not being bogged down, but life would be dull without this smell and softness. Thanks, Kerastase!</li>
    <li> Kerastase is a great line of products from L&#x27;Oreal.  This product is no exception.  I use it once a week and my hair is in great condition.  I have long and thick hair that has a fine texture and gets tangled very easily.  Kerastase helps keep my hair in manageable shape.  My only complaint is the cost.</li>
    <li> I honestly really wanted to love this product especially after seeing all of the positive reviews. Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling in any better condition and the (lingering)  smell of it is not for me.  I actually get better results from a $7 conditioning mask I bought from Walgreens.  So while I believe this may work wonders for some reviewers,  I personally found it to be a waste of $30.</li>
    <li> Though this product is quite costly, I really think it helped my dry hair, more so than any other product I have tried.  I have my hair colored and wear a  loose perm.  I am only using it every few days, but I really do feel it has helped and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Long-time user of Kerastase and I love it.  It&#x27;s pricey, but a good investment in the overall look and feel of my hair.  Since I&#x27;ve used it regularly, my hair looks better and feels softer/silkier than it ever has and is easy to manage.  Also, it&#x27;s concentrated so it lasts.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and really enjoy the silky texture of my hair following a treatment. The fragrance is nice and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I just got out of the shower after using this hair mask. From the very beginning, the scent stung my nostrils, I expected a well-established brand such as Kerastase to smell much better. While the product did make my hair slightly softer, the effect is not much different than using a $3 Pantene conditioner. Overall totally not worth the price. If you look at the ingredients, the main ones were water, cetearyl alcohol, and glycerin, the primary ingredients of cheap soap. I&#x27;m turning to something more natural. If you&#x27;re looking for a good natural hair mask, a mashed avocado and honey are great. But I am never buying this again for sure.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my salon and i definitely have seen an improvement in the health of my hair. I pair it with the leave in treatment as well and its a great match.  My hair doesn&#x27;t get as frizzy as easily either.</li>
    <li> I had been hearing a lot about Kerastase Masquintense, but was reluctant to try it because of the big price tag. I finally caved and I&#x27;m glad I did. I have fairly straight, thick, frizzy hair and this stuff worked wonders. I get more of an effect the more often I use it, but the high price keeps my use minimal. Thankfully, you don&#x27;t need to use it that often to get noticeable results. I use it once or twice a week, leaving it in for about five minutes then rinsing out with cool to cold water. I usually follow up with a touch of Frizz Ease. Without fail, it does amazing things for my hair. It makes my hair so soft and shiny, I can&#x27;t stop touching it. Seriously. I don&#x27;t even need to use my flat iron or other styling products to make my hair \\&quot;manageable.\\&quot; If you&#x27;ve got difficult hair (who doesn&#x27;t?), I would at least give this a try in spite of the price because it will probably work for you. I guess you really do get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> My hair is definitely much softer after using this product.  I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive!  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair due to coloring, highlighting, sun and styling.  I was hoping to spend extra and get it.  Sadly, I don&#x27;t find this product to be all that I have read it to be.  Tried it with moist heat and leaving it on for 30 minutes, after I highlighted under a hat to the salon... no big results.  I have used many hair masks, deep conditioning treatments.  It is my opinion that this one is not worth the price tag.  Still searching for the one that &amp;#34;WOW!&amp;#34;s me.</li>
    <li> I researched a long time online for the best products to buy for black hair. I found a recommendation for this and after trying it out, I absolutely love it! My hair is very dry and after using this product, it came out nice, soft and bouncy. I was simply amazed! I would totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product after reading other reviews...but so far I&#x27;m not really impressed. My hair feels a little better than before, but not enough to justify the cost. I have only used it a few times, and I hope it will get better with time....but so far...I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> I have fine, wavy, overprocessed hair that I am trying to grow out so I don&#x27;t want to get it cut - this is the only thing that makes it soft and easy to manage to straighten it out. It makes it so moist and soft that I can go 3 days without it drying out. But yet it isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy. Makes your hair smell divine and it is so soft! When my hair is highlighted all over a lot, I keep it on my hair 30 minutes, at least, before washing it out and then putting on another quick coat. When I bleach all of my hair really (Gwen Stefani) light, then I put this on and sleep in it and then my hair is great. My natural color is very dark brown, so the more bleach used, the longer this needs to stay in. I use it every time I shampoo and I do believe it even has a cumulative effect - the more you use it, the better your hair condition becomes over time. Weird! It is my &#x27;desert island&#x27; product of choice! :)  Also- a little goes a very long way so it lasts a long time for the money, compared to thinner-based products they have like the age recharge/premium conditioner...</li>
    <li> So I bought some of this stuff in the hopes that it would help repair the damage I had done to my hair through bleaching/ coloring, and it works pretty well so far.  I used it for the first time tonight and my hair is pretty soft/ silky to the touch, but it isn&#x27;t weighed down or greasy (though I imagine if you use too much of this product that your hair might get a bit greasy, because it is super concentrated).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive, but you don&#x27;t really need to use a whole lot of it (even for longer hair), so I expect it to last for a long time.  I would say that this is more something I would use once a week or so instead of an everyday product though.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.  It makes my hair feel soft and look shiny.  My hair gets dry easily, especially in the winter, and this conditioner makes my hair soft without feeling greasy like some deep conditioners.  I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.  I have tried many other cheaper products though, looking for a substitute, and nothing compares.</li>
    <li> softens hair and smells good. A little pricy but it will last long so won&#x27;t need another one for another 6 months or so</li>
    <li> Makes my coarse hair nice and soft.  Gets better results with continuing use.  Do not need much and does not build up in my hair like some heavy. Conditioners</li>
    <li> This actually works! I was hoping it the hype would be untrue because this product is expensive, but it work and you will waste your money with less expensive and less effective products. This made my hair so soft and shiny after just one use. I use it as a daily conditioner now, and will probably never use anything else. It smells great, too.</li>
    <li> This product is extremely expensive, but worth it. I was disappointed because I bought this product based on the reviews, but it did not help my dry/curly hair. If I were you over the counter products work just as good as this, if not better. Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant because I saw this product contains a lot of glicerin. I know this is not good for your hair long-term. Also, I have the Moroccanoil Repair mask, which is hard to beat. But I wanted to give it a try since my hair was in desperate need of some moisture. I have long hair and did ombre highlights about a year ago, but what really damages it is when i use my curling iron. The ends were very dry and brittle. If I had gone to a hairdresser in that state they would have wanted to cut 2 or 3 inches off my hair. Anyways, I washed my hair in the shower with shampoo only, got out of the shower and did not brush it, just applied this mask. To keep the heat in, I put aluminum foil and a shower cap (trick I learned from a hairdresser), left it on for about 30 minutes, showered again to rinse it. My hair was so soft and completely untangled. It looks fresh and so soft. I don&#x27;t care for the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad either. The Moroccanoil one smells better. I&#x27;m happy with this product and I&#x27;d recommend it to people who need a hair fix.</li>
    <li> This worked great on my dry brittle, frizzy, colored hair.  Nothing else worked.  A lot of money, but well worth every cent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a handful of hair masks ranging in price from $10 - $90 and this is, by far, the most effective.  It&#x27;s expensive, but worth it.  Plus, using it once per week makes the cost more manageable.  It smooths my frizzy hair, conditions well, and smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I have long, course, Asian, wavy, frizzy, and extremely thick hair (I have to have it thinned out every 6 weeks due to headaches from the heaviness of my hair).</li>
    <li> I have curly, frizzy, dry hair. To wear it curly all I do is condition my hair with this and then I don&#x27;t wash it out. I leave it in and let it air dry or I dry it with a diffuser. This gives me soft curls (not even greasy as you might expect!) and leaving the mask in my hair is good for it.     Because of the price I alternate between this and cheaper conditioner.. using this when I want to wear my hair curly or when it&#x27;s been feeling damaged and cheaper conditioner otherwise. It&#x27;s great stuff but I can&#x27;t afford to buy it often. Thankfully, it&#x27;s strong stuff so I only need to use a little bit of it at a time, so the tub lasts longer than you&#x27;d think.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used serious hair treatment products before - the previous treatment include Asience products (http://www.amazon.com/Asience-KAO-Treatment-180g/dp/B000JJXGDU/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;s&#x3D;beauty&amp;qid&#x3D;1240770409&amp;sr&#x3D;1-3)    You don&#x27;t need a LOT of the keratase masquintense product but because I have a lot of hair, i probably use more than most people.      After using it for nearly 3 weeks, I do feel like my hair is smoother, but because my hair is pretty damaged (from yuko and then perm and dye), a miracle didn&#x27;t happen!  but i duno if any product could work miracles on my hair!    the reason i gave 4 stars was because i don&#x27;t feel it is significantly different/better than the asience products~ hope this helps...</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the best hair treatments Ive used. Im a cosmetologist and Ive tried many treatments. My hair is over processed and I use heat tools in my hair often. It smooths the cuticle and leaves your hair soft and shiny. I bought the shampoo and the leave in hair milk. The shampoo is also good but Im not too happy about all the sulfates in the shampoo. The hair milk is amazing I will never use anything else as a leave in ever!!</li>
    <li> BEST conditioner around. i only wash my hair about 2x a week so i use this each time and WOW my hair feels great after. this is a must for girls with dry and/or curly hair!</li>
    <li> I have been using Kerastase for the last 4 years and it has left my hair smooth, silky and without Fizz. I used this Mask once and knew it didn&#x27;t feel right. THen my hair became rough, full of tangles. Definitely a fake one.</li>
    <li> This stuff saved and has continued to rejuvenate my hair that I bleached it into a fluffy yellow mess a year ago. I still have about 1/3 of the container left too since it spreads really well so you only need about a teaspoon of it at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I will warn about is that it seems to get rid of curls. It makes it INCREDIBLY soft - but in the process it makes my normally curly hair less curly. I don&#x27;t care at all though. I would trade fried curly hair hair for healthy smooth hair any day.</li>
    <li> Still one of the best deep conditioners I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I have fine,,colored treated hair but a great amount of it. This product removes the knots and makes my hair soft and silky. Prior to using this product when my hair was wet it would be very difficult to comb through.Now,when I apply a small amount of kerastase nutritive masquintense to my hair after shampooing my hair becomes soft, subtle and tangle free. Furthermore, this product is concentrated so the 6.8 oz container lasts for about 5 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product for individuals who need to add moisturizer to fine hair that has been highlighted.</li>
    <li> This conditioner completely changed my hair.  I first was introduced to it at a salon, and while I thought it was insanely expensive (at least compared to the grocery-store brands I had been using) it is WORTH EVERY PENNY.  Additionally, it&#x27;s not that expensive when you consider that, for the first time in my life, I could use the recommended amount of product rather than five times the recommended amount!  I probably only need 2 bottles of this conditioner in a year.  Highly recommend to anyone with curly, dry hair.</li>
    <li> all of the kerastase products r sooo awful! expensive for nothing!!!! it made my hair fall off as soon as i applied it! worst product ever</li>
    <li> best stuff you can find!  my big long hair is ually really cooperative but lately has been dry, blah, unshiney and started using what my salon uses (kerastase) and it&#x27;s amazing!  everything they have is amazing!  while shopping for their products on amazon can be a little cheaper, their website gives you two free samples with every order, so... take your pick.  everything the set their hands to is wonderful!</li>
    <li> No improvement in my hair.</li>
    <li> Great for a intense treatment, I also use as conditioner every day, I think it leaves my hair very light and well treated.</li>
    <li> I hate to say it but I work in a salon that exclusively carries the line. The product line is constantly changing the line is prescriptive towards the needs of your hair. A simple strand test can answer that &amp; can easily be giving at any salon that carries a contract with kerastase and has been educated on the products. The dates are listed because unfortunately the product expires in 6 months. Kerastase is HEAVEN but only when it&#x27;s still gold :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice and it&#x27;s completely changed my hair. My ends are in need of serious moisture, but I have lots of fine hair that gets weighed down easily.. No problem with this miracle product!</li>
    <li> Love it - refuse to use anything else : )</li>
    <li> I bought this product after my hair dresser at Great Clips - yes, Great Clips - told me that my hair needed some additional moisture. After looking through reviews of several products, a website labeled this item &#x27;the holy grail of deep conditioners&#x27;. Though very pricey for what I would regularly pay for hair products (that&#x27;s why it gets 4 out of 5 stars), I can definitely see a noticeable difference in my hair appearance. My split ends are virtually gone. My hair feels less frizzy, and it feels like it can actually grow long again. With dry hair, I coat the ends of my hair with it at night before I go to bed, and it needs to be rinsed out in the morning to get the product out, and my hair feels GREAT! Not sure if I&#x27;ll be using this every day for the rest of my life, but it&#x27;s great for those big days like getting hitched!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a great curling iron that I used at 475 degrees, which allowed my curls to stay in all day for several days.  Well within a week or so of doing that, i noticed my hair was burning and super duper dry. I could even smell my hair burnt throughout the day.  NOT COOL!!! Ive used other deep conditioners but have left me with mediocre results.  I purchased Masquintense with the hopes that it would fix my burnt hair.  Im happy to say that with the first application it worked! Amazing! I left it on for 10 mins while in the shower. Now I only need to use it for 5 mins every other day.  I no longer use the curling iron at such high heat but when I do use it at lower heat, my hair looks healthy again. I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Keratase is owned by Loreal and in my opinion, my results with this mask were no better than they were with the drugstore Loreal mask, which costs $7.  I&#x27;ve been disappointed by every Keratase product I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve had better results with Shea Moisture&#x27;s Manuka Honey mask than I ever had with this stuff.  I bought my Keratase mask some time after Loreal had purchased the company.  I belong to the hair forum on makeupalley.com and there are very few Keratase fans there.  I will no longer shell out big bucks in the hope that Keratase can solve all my hair issues.  I&#x27;ve had great results with Living Proof Perfect Hair Day shampoo and conditioner and the Shea Moisture mask and I now have a great hair day nearly every day, no thanks to Keratase.  I wasted my money on this product.  My hair is dry from constant coloring and heat styling, but LP and SM have come to the rescue.  Yes, I tried Keratase shampoo and conditioner and all they did was fade my hair color big time.  They had no effect at all on the dryness.  Now the Keratase shampoo and conditioner live in my hall closet, which is full of hair product FAILS.  I have no problem spending money on products that actually do what they promise, but Keratase did not, so into the closet it goes.  Maybe I can pawn it off on a friend somehow.  I definitely do not recommend this Keratase mask, try Shea Moisture instead.  SM is available at drugstores, Target, Ulta and Sally&#x27;s and even Walmart (although the Manuka Honey formula is only at Target for some strange reason).  I use my SM mask with a heat cap for 45 minutes or so once a week and I get silky, soft, shiny hair.  Much better results than I ever got with any Keratase product.  And LP is superior to Keratase s/c in every way and it&#x27;s sulfate free (which protects my color) too!  So I&#x27;m through with Keratase.  Maybe it was the bomb at one point in the past, but now it&#x27;s no better than drugstore Loreal and I&#x27;m certainly not paying a premium for that.  If you really want great hair, try the products I&#x27;ve recommended and skip this Keratase mask.  It&#x27;s simply not worth it.want great hair, try the products I&#x27;ve recommended and skip this Keratase mask.  It&#x27;s simply not worth it.</li>
    <li> Kerastase Nutritive Masquintense 6.8 oz Hair Thick Mask. I bought this treatment and it leaves my hair very soft and untangle, I will repurchase it,</li>
    <li> I purchased this for the first time at a high end salon over a year ago.  I would use it every day if I could afford to.  It makes my hair so soft and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best conditioning treatments out on the market right now.  Ever since I got my hair thermally reconditioned.  It has been a challenge finding products that will not be repelled by my hair this is one of the few products that actually help my hair to behave.  It smells great and always helps me relax while I&#x27;m taking a shower as well.  I will try their other products based on the experience I&#x27;ve had with this one in a heart beat.  If you can try to run a search on this with 500ml container, it is expensive so don&#x27;t bother complaining if you want what this offers you have to be willing to shell out the dough.  Though if you run the search in google, you are likely to find a seller (possibly through Amazon) that will sell the largest container for about $80 it is worth it trust me!  the 500ml will last you about 1 year if you use it sparingly with other shampoo and conditioners in between.  One thing I can say for sure is that I do not regret a dime I&#x27;ve spent on this product.  It truly is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I purchased masintense about a month ago and have been using it nearly everyday. It only takes a little to cover all my hair (just below my shoulders). I leave it in about 5 minutes on regular days and I wrap it in a warmed towel and leave it about 20 minutes about 1 or 2 days a week. I have damaged, fine hair and it works miracles! Probably not an everyday product (is intense and very expensive), but that&#x27;s how I use it and it and I really, really like how it makes my hair feel. After a month my hair has a lot less breakage, feels softer, takes less product to achieve my desired style, and just feels and looks more healthy. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars ONLY because this product is very expensive. I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Love this mask, great to hydrate your hair, just use like 2 to 3 times a week and your hair will look great. Kerastase is one of the best.</li>
    <li> i just love how it smells and how it makes my hair feel after I use the Kerastase shampoo, this masque works better than the L&#x27;Oreal masque I got for my hair at the drug store. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> This nutritive masquintense Mark used to be a very good product,  but this last one a bought look like does not seem the same formula.</li>
    <li> When I first saw the price for the Kerastase products, I was hoping that I would think they were all hype so that I wouldn&#x27;t want to try them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was first recommended to me by my hairdresser, who told me it was the best product she&#x27;s ever used. So having thick, chemically straightened, highlighted (so damaged!) hair, I bought it and gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fantastic. Truly. You only need a little bit, and it just  s-l-i-d-e-s  through your hair. I wash my hair every 5 days, and the 6.8 ounce bottle has lasted for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this product works well on dry, damaged hair - it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used. So I can only imagine what it would do on normal, unprocessed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. It&#x27;s expensive, but it works, and the jar lasts longer than you think.</li>
    <li> Cant love it more , this product is amazing. I do think that the health of hair depends of your helt . However, i decided to change after more than 15 years the color of my hair , from black to something lighter.In order to do that i had to do some type of bleach( not as strong but still damaging) . My healthy long hair looked horrible. I had to cut it from all the way down my waist to a little above my bra line. Anyways, whatever was left was also very damaged, and this product has work wonders. At the begging , i did not think it was a big deal, but the more i use it ( logical) the better it gets. I do leave it in my hair sometimes just hoping it works better. It is kind of sticky if you leave it in your hair but i usually do it when im going swimming ( which i do 2-3 times a week) . I love it and although expensive i will keep buying it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hair care product junky, so I&#x27;ve tried more products than I can count and this is the most amazing conditioner ever! It is very expensive, I&#x27;ll admit, but worth it if you can afford it. (I don&#x27;t use it everyday because it&#x27;s so expenseive, but even 2-3 times per week makes a difference. Before a big event I&#x27;ll use it almost every day for 2 weeks and my naturally blah hair looks worthy of a Pantene commercial!) I don&#x27;t think the shampoo is worth the price though. It&#x27;s nice and a little better than drug store brands, but not worth the price.</li>
    <li> I by Keratase products all the time and this one is definitely fake.  It took like 2 months to come in and was a texture like kindergarten paste and smelled like baby oil.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair conditioner!</li>
    <li> Great product that really works! I use it weekly for healthy and vibrant gaur. Highly recommend thus product to family and friends</li>
    <li> Good and fast delivery packaging was brilliant since using it has improved my hair very good treatment for 4C hair! Would purchase again thx</li>
    <li> They shipped it very fast from the UK.. This product was at a great price.It is the best hair treatment I have found for my long beautiful hair. My husband likes my hair and it is important that I use the finest products available to keep him always interested and allured. This is one of those fine products and makes my hair look and feel fabulous.</li>
    <li> I love Kerastase products anyway and thought I&#x27;d splurge on the mask.  I do use sparingly but notice a difference when I use.  For a special occasion I&#x27;ll use a few days in a row and love the outcome!</li>
    <li> the product take a long time to get to me ,but is very good,know I be came a prime and maybe dont teke to longer to get next time!!</li>
    <li> There really is not any other product on the market that works as well. The container last for a long time as you use just a very small amount. It works like a magic. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s many products that have similar results that you can make in your kitchen (oils)</li>
    <li> Great weekly conditioner for dry or stressed hair. If you use products that &amp;#34;relax&amp;#34; your hair already, then you will want to use this less often (maybe every other week). I absolutely love this conditioner and all you need is a small amount. It will last you months and really help your hair. I told a co-worker about it who had very dry stressed overly processes hair and she bought it and loves it. Her hair looks tremendously better.</li>
    <li> Cant say enough about this product!! My hair was so deeply damaged while I was living in Germany.  The water was horrible and I had my hair done (highlights) and they deeply damaged it as well. I have always had think, longgg blonde hair and my hair was falling out, literally.  It was thinning and breaking like crazy.  It was not growing because it was breaking before it could.  I bought and tried many products, including several Redken repair products, argon oil, macadamia oil... nothing worked.  I read an article on this one, did some research and then decided to give it a try.  After one use I was blown away! My hair was thicker, it was soft, the split ends looked substantially better.  The shine and elasticity was noticeable.  I have now been using it for a few weeks and couldn&#x27;t be happier, it is well worth the money.  In addition to using this, I have also started using Silk elements Megasilk as a heat protectant and smoother.  This is also an amazing product! The two together have made such a difference.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a month now. I see such a difference in my hair.  I have color treated hair and this conditioner makes my hair so silky and shiny. This is the brand of products my hair salon uses and I never purchase it from them because they charge around 30 percent more.</li>
    <li> great stuff, been using it for years.  I feel it&#x27;s the only conditioner that truly keeps my hair healthy.</li>
    <li> I have used this before and spent double in my salon...love it!!!</li>
    <li> I have mid-back thick, wavy, light brown/red hair. I use a lot of heat on my hair so it tends to become dry and damaged easily if I don&#x27;t take good care of it. Since I discovered this product 4 years ago, I can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments I get on my hair! It makes my hair so shiny, bouncy, frizz free, and soft.  I use it as a regular conditioner after I shampoo. I rarely use it as a hair mask because of time, but when I do, the product works even better. Also, at CVS this product costs $60. Soooo... buy it on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One negative for some people might be the smell.. it has a strong perfume that I hated at first. I don&#x27;t mind it though, because it&#x27;s worth it to have nice hair :)</li>
    <li> It really smooth&#x27;s your hair out, but made mine limp and could not do anything with it.  Not a good choice for me.</li>
    <li> I definitely see a difference when I use this product. While it is not AMAZING it does a better job than most conditioners out there. My hair is pretty fine and dry so there may be little I can do to make my hair as silky and healthy as I would like, but this definitely helps some.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years.  It still remains true to form.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in a thick mask.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find the conditioner I was using so I tried this one. This can be a dicey situation purchasing online but this is authentic. It smells nice and leaves my long hair smooth and soft!</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner ever! Conditions without making hair look greasy. You only have to use a little so it lasts forever!</li>
    <li> Immediately made a huge difference in my hair condition.  I only needed a very small amount. My hair is very fine. Great product!</li>
    <li> The packaging was fine but they sent the wrong product. I ordered the mask for fine hair and received the thick hair mask. I opened and used it before I realized it was the wrong item. Be sure to check your item before you use it...</li>
    <li> Has definitely helped my hair and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Good product, works great, hair repair is visible since first use, but the down side would be... it is extremely over priced. :(</li>
    <li> Love it!! Improved the condition of my hair soo much totally would purchase again! My hair is smooth and easier to manage i really liked this product other than the price but totally worth it</li>
    <li> I love kerastase but didn&#x27;t want to pay full price, I thought I was clever, bought it cheaply on Ebay-awful, full of baby cream, drying. I thought Amazon would be safer-NOT SO!  I bought this and a Pureology cream from Neon and Noble. Pureology was fine, this was not, so either buy it from reputable retailer or forget buying it here.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I ever bought . I have medium hair length. So I use this product very little like penny size. My hair has become alive shinny and more manageable.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. You will see the difference immediately after using it. It is expensive but It really works. Thanks</li>
    <li> I HAVE THIN AND DAMAGED HAIR AND AFTER I READ ALL THE REVIEWS I DECIDED TO EXPEND MY MONEY IN THIS PRODUCT THAT IS VERY EXPENSIVE.  AFTER USING IT FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS MY HAIR IS WORSE THAN EVER, MY HAIR ENDS ARE CRUNCHY AND VERY DRY. I APPRECIATE IF SOME OF THE WRITERS OF THESE FABULOUS REVIEWS COULD GIVE ME SOME TIPS, BECAUSE I FOLLOWED THE PRODUCT INSTRUCTIONS WITH NO LUCK.</li>
    <li> They gave me a free treatment in the salon with this product.  It was supposed to be a $30 value.  I loved the product and how soft and smooth it made my hair so purchased my own!</li>
    <li> I think the green glass vials are a better way to go for damaged bleached hair.</li>
    <li> this product is amazing, the best thing for your hair!</li>
    <li> great, very good, I love it</li>
    <li> I have very thick and long curly hair. It gets dry and frizzy very easily and can almost always be tangled and have too much volume. It is difficult hair. Kerastase Masquintense is the only thing that has saved my hair. Every good hair dresser I have had has used and recommended this product. It makes my hair shinny, soft, healthy, and controlable. Every time I use it I get compliments. If you have dry, frizzy, or curly hair that you want to keep healhty, you MUST try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Fast Frizz/Volume Moisture Treatment: Wash your hair, apply Masquintense and leave it in for 5-10 minutes in the shower, then rinse out. Easy to do and will really help take out the tangles and tame your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Deep Moisture Treatment: They do this at salons and charge tons of money, but you can do it at home. Wash you hair well and then comb through Masquintense. Put a plastic shower cap on your hair. Then put a plug-in headed hair cap/hood on top of the shower cap and sit with the heat on for 30 minutes. (If you don&#x27;t have a heated hood/cap - you can buy it on Amazon, which is what I did - then just wrap some towels around your head and your own head heat will work too) Then wash out the product and your frizzy hair will feel soooo soft. This is exactly what they will do in a salon and charge anywhere between $35 (if you are lucky) to $65 for the service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is great. The texture is nice. A little goes a long way. Totally worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Even though my hair is fine and blond it is very \\&quot;dense\\&quot; as my stylist calls it. There is a lot of it and it is wavy and tangles. It gets in the swimming pool with me at least three times a week and the ocean once a week. Then it bakes in the sun for several hours. You can imagine how badly it needs a deep conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a good amount of this in my hair and comb it through after I shampoo once a week. It makes my hair incredibly shiney and silky soft. No splits or breakage at all happen to my hair in spite of the beating it takes. This keeps it looking like perfect silky runway models hair. I will gladly pay the high price for this an now get the large size since I use a lot of this. I have started applying this to my hair and combing it through each time I get in the pool or ocean now to protect it. I actually stays in while I swim and when I get out, I leave it on to bake in the sun and let me tell you, when I rinse it out my hair looks better than ever. I never plan to run out of this. I would pay twice the already steep price. Love this!</li>
    <li> Kerastase Nutritive Masquintense Hair Thick Mask does the job in keeping hair healthy and in correcting split ends. I spent $30 for a hair treatment that used about a tablespoon of this product, so this product at this price is very cost effective.</li>
    <li> If you have over-treated hair this thing is for you. I leave it in between washes and my hair is silky and perfect to the touch</li>
    <li> When I was searching for a hair masque I had a bleached pixie hair cut, my hair had actually broken in some places! I bought this masque and it made the difference in me keeping my bleached hair and letting it grow out! Will always recommend this for dry hair!  Saved my favorite haircut!</li>
    <li> It helps rescue my dried hair.&lt;br /&gt;I love go swimming without wearing hats,so it makes my hair awful.&lt;br /&gt;But every time I use this after swimming, my hair looks shine the second day!&lt;br /&gt;It worths that money!</li>
    <li> This is an extremely high quality conditioner that Ive used for years. So happy I can get this wonderful conditioner at a reasonable price now. :)</li>
    <li> This is the first review ever I have written in my life.  BUY THIS PRODUCT!! I lost my hair to chemo &amp; it grew back in a different texture, curly and totally unmanageable. I tried every salon conditioner on the market, from every brand and nothing worked.  Due to the price, Kerastase Masquintense was my last resort. OH MY GOSH I have never had a product change my hair like this! Do not let the price deter you. It is not much more expensive than using other brand conditioners, as you only have to use a small amount. TRY TRY TRY this!! You will never go back!</li>
    <li> While the product is just okay, for my long thick hair it definitely isn&#x27;t as moisturizing as I expected for a &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34;.. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Thick, creamy texture, great cosmetic for the hairs. I love it. Thank you</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a Kerastase product what can I say works great!</li>
    <li> This is a great deep conditioner.  It was an authentic product.</li>
    <li> got product on time and it was a good price for the product.  Kerastase Hair Masque is the best out there.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I bought, as expected.</li>
    <li> i loved the way it made my hair feel, it was so soft and smooth. i will tell a friend.</li>
    <li> My hair looks fantastic, it  is a great product, I will buy it again, the price is fair  and is worthy</li>
    <li> This  product will be on my shelf forever now!!&lt;br /&gt;I can easily say that this is the best product I ever tried and it does wonders for the hair!&lt;br /&gt;I am using it all the time after shampoo and it just gives extra softness.</li>
    <li> I accidentally stumbled upon this product...&lt;br /&gt;I had been buying the &amp;#34;Fins&amp;#34; version...and didn&#x27;t realize that I was buying the &amp;#34;Grosso&amp;#34; version until it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;At first, I was going to return it...because it was different.&lt;br /&gt;Then...reality set in.&lt;br /&gt;This product is superior.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;fins&amp;#34; had smelled like old-lady-perfume, and was runny...this one has barely a scent, and is THICK.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, curly, processed, dry hair...and I can honestly say that I can leave the &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; out of that sentence now.&lt;br /&gt;I do not follow directions, however, and I leave it in.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s right...I do not rinse as they insist upon.&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I have used it as a hair mask for the last few washings...and my hair is prettier than it&#x27;s ever been.&lt;br /&gt;I wash/condition/towel dry...and then use a small amount of this Masquintense...and leave it in.&lt;br /&gt;Then I use my finger to guide a few curls while it&#x27;s still wet...and let it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;I used to have to use a bottle of Morroccanoil per 2 weeks...no more.&lt;br /&gt;This product is very much worth the money...&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t waste it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Yay!!</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for a couple of years. I love how silky and manageable it makes my hair. glad to finally find it available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS TREATMENT A LOT!!! I USED IT AFTER MY SHAMPOO AND LEAVE IN 10 MINUTES ON HIGH HEAT WHILE IN THE DRYER EVEN THOU U DONT HAVE TO BUT IM EXPLAINING EXACTLY HOW I DID IT. IT SMELLS AWESOME AND IT LEAVES MY THIN DRY CURLY AND FRIZZY HAIR SO SOFT AND MANAGEABLE AND SILKY, FRIZZ FREE AND SHINNY! IT IS KINDA PRICEY AND WISH IT WAS A LITTLE CHEAPER, THAT&#x27;S THE ONLY NEGATIVE!</li>
    <li> Yes, I would recommend this product. My hair feels a lot more nourished and softer. It&#x27;s very good for dry hair</li>
    <li> This mask is just average hair mask. It is not worth the price at all. You can buy natural organic coconut oil and make better hair mask with honey and coconut oil for example..But what worried me the most is that this mask contains PARABEN!!!Its toxic, its carcinogenic, so ladies watch out and take care of your health first and foremost! I would never bu this product and would not recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Hi, thank you for the conditioner it&#x27;s an amazing product. I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this,I love it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> based on the price I was expecting more than just a conditioner, but I didn&#x27;t feel the diffrence that much, maybe cuz I use it once a week.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on and off for years, and it is by far the best deep conditioner I have ever used. It is expensive, but it is worth the money. A little bit goes a long way and you can use it just once a week and see a noteworthy improvement in your hair. I couldn’t be more enthusiastic about recommending this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever tried. Excellent product!!! Would highly recommend it to everyone!!! You won&#x27;t regret the purchase.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Whenever I use this product, I feel my hair is soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> My daughter gave me a tiny sample of this and said be sure to buy the orange cap.&lt;br /&gt;The tiny sample worked so well I followed her instructions. OOPS!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I should have gotten the one for fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;I now have enough to last a lifetime...Oh well, ya live and ya learn, hopefully :0)</li>
    <li> Really helped repair my dry and perm damaged hair. I used the conditioner along with the shampoo and the oleo relax anti freeze. People noticed after a little while and would comment how my hair looked much healthier after I had been using the products for a month or so.</li>
    <li> Best conditoner ever.  Tried many in the past .  Good for coarse  straight or curley hair. Brings color treated hair back to life.</li>
    <li> While searching for a good conditioner to tame my thick,natural wavy, highlighted hair, I ordered the Kerastase Thick Mask. Not until after I ordered and made payment did I realize that it was being shipped from the UK and an estimated arrival was a month away. I received the package in three weeks and was excited to apply it to my hair. I usually don&#x27;t spend this much money on hair products, but I had read the reviews which said it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I have been searching for a product to smooth and make my hair silky feeling. Needless to say, I was disappointed.  It didn&#x27;t help condition my hair any better than the drugstore $3.99 conditioners.  So, I&#x27;m back to square one and feel guilty about spending this much on a beauty product that I&#x27;m not satisfied with.</li>
    <li> This product performed as promised. It is right up there in my estimation with a few of the really luxurious and solidly performing conditioners. The shipping cost was prohibitive so I will most likely buy something comparable in a store or salon.</li>
    <li> To be honest I read most of the reviews on amazon and the ones that gave less than 3 stars scared me a bit, especially in regards to there being protein in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I trusted that since the majority of people were raving about it I would give it a try, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I have pretty fine hair I used the thick version because I have a lot of hair. All I can say is WOW. Even though my hair isn&#x27;t that damaged (I have only dyed my hair twice in my lifetime and I&#x27;m 25) just a bit too much straightening and blow drying, my hair has never been very manageable and always frizzed no matter what heat protectant I used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was just incredible after using this product. Normally I would blow dry my hair with a round brush and use a flat iron to straighten it because my hair gets this one weird wave mid length but after using this product it just went straight and silky just after a quick blow dry. No more frizz for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably won&#x27;t use it every wash but once a week seems to do the trick. Definitely worth the money. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this for the winter to keep the static out of mine and my daughter&#x27;s hair, during the dry Midwest cold. It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and this particular jar did not seem authentic.  it was clumpy and not smooth as usual and it just didn&#x27;t have the same affect as usual. will try another vendor next time</li>
    <li> Love using this 1/mo. to get a deep condition treatment for my hair. Put it in straight out of the shower with warm hair, wrap it in a towel to keep warmth in, wait 30 min, rinse w/ cool water to seal it in. I use a big tooth comb as I rinse it out to make it more smooth.</li>
    <li> Been using this conditioner for more than 15 years and it&#x27;s the only one that tames my hair without leaving any residue. However you need to use only a tiny portion after shampooing. It will last a long time. A great hair product for sure.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff, she is very happy with our purchase and the product quality, recommend for others who like or need this!</li>
    <li> This product changed my damaged unhealthy dry dull hair into a shinny, healthy,  beautiful hair! very happy, definitely recomend ithis hair treatment</li>
    <li> Hands down this is the best hair mask/ conditioner for dry hair. Worth every cent.</li>
    <li> This is the best mask I have ever tried on my very damage hair. It works when your hair is healthy as well.</li>
    <li> This really is an awesome treatment. I gave it 4 stars because, well.. its expensive. I can see how the jar may last you a while if you do not use it everyday and if you only use a small amount, but otherwise; it you have long hair, this will not last you as long as some of the reviews say. When I first openned the package it smelled very perfumy.. and very strong. I used it as a treatment and put it all over my hair &amp; then I put a plastic bag over it for 20 minutes. After I washed it off my hair felt extremely soft and smooth. Once my hair dried it still felt smooth and soft, it did not look especially shiny though. It will leave your hair managable and soft, and the smell is definitely not strong or overpowering afterwards. It smells clean and nice. As far as my hair looking healthier, I can&#x27;t say I have seen the effects yet, I have only used it twice. I say definitely worth it though, and ideal if only used a couple of times per week as a treatment.</li>
    <li> This is the one remedy I always turn to when my color damaged hair needs moisture. I leave it on for half an hour, gently rinse out. Hair feels silky again.</li>
    <li> This is a little container of heaven! I have a long naturally dry wavy frizzy poofy hair! You little need a small little dollop of this conditioner and it does wonders. My hair is naturally dark brown and I have it ombr&amp;egrave;d to blonde currently. My hair is super dry and damaged especially the ends. This conditioner makes me feel like I have normal hair after its washed and air dried. All I have to do is flat iron it and it looks like hair straight from interest &#x3D;) I only wash my hair one or twice a week so this little container lasts me up to 2-3 months. You have to be a little stingy with it but a little seriously goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!  When I first started using this conditioner a few years ago, I noticed an immediate difference in the condition of my hair.it was shinier, and just looked and felt healthy.  Then I questioned how much I was spending and switched to a cheaper brand.  Never again.  This is a great product...it really works and its a great value because you use much less of it!</li>
    <li> excellent product, good price</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy a product at amazon due to the additional shipping fees. Today I passed by a salon and saw it, told her my story and purchased it there for the original price. Even though I am more on the sceptical side she explained me very, very convincingly that Kerastase does not approve selling through any channels other than their approved salons and that they NEVER EVER go on sale. So, she swore that if I see products on amazon that they are most likely fake or at the very least passed the expiration date.&lt;br /&gt;She went on saying that it is a well known problem that they come in original-style packaging but are filled not with the real stuff. Also, should it be a price anything below the original sales price it is 100% fake or at the very least old.&lt;br /&gt;Now, as I mentioned at the beginning, am I a sceptical person and can see that the hair salon seller has her own agenda and most likely wants to sell her products with a nice margin and does not want me to go to amazon and get it cheaper.... but her story was very convincing and I am left wondering and definitely hesitant to  buy any further Kerastase products at Amazon before I was not able clarify this matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I get a chance I will reach out to Kerastase and ask them directly and update you guys. Right now I am considering to copy paste my review to other popular Amazon Kerastase products as well so that people are aware of the risk.</li>
    <li> this is my go to mask when my thick hair is really dry and damaged. i&#x27;ve tired many masks and this is def my fave.</li>
    <li> I bought this product out of sheer desperation with my bleached damaged dried out fried frizzy hair as i had tried every other cheap drug store brand of conditioners and treatments but none of which had worked. was skeptical about this product for a long time and the price tag is off putting i was worried it would be a tremoundous waste of money. however i am pleasently suprised and relevied this product has achieved what no drugstore brand could it has brought my hair back to life and after one use has left it feeling better than ever !! i highly recommend it is worth the money and a little goes a long way so i can see this lasting along time and with the lasting results i will only need to use once every couple of weeks</li>
    <li> This product was a staple for us but buying it on line, without the hassle of going to a salon and paying higher prices was wonderful!</li>
    <li> Just to use a little (4 corns size) can simply improve the quality of my hair, good smell, I will be a return cusomter.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine recommended me this product. She said that it helped her repair dry ends and made hair grow much faster. I was a little skeptical, especially due to high price, because I don&#x27;t normally buy anything that expensive for my hair, but finally decided to give it a try. Must admit thar by using this balm once a week, I have much less split ends than before. But the most amazing thing is that I&#x27;ve been trying to grow my hair for years, without much luck, but with Kerastase it grew at least 6 inches in less than a year, no kidding! Now receive lots of compliments about how long my hair is. Will definitely buy another one (6.7 oz lasted me about 10 months)</li>
    <li> This is the very best conditioner I have ever used... and I have used the best of the best.  It makes my hair so soft and the smell is also unforgettable!  I love to leave it in for a long time and after I rinse, it&#x27;s like a whole new head of hair.  It is expensive, but worth it to me.  It doesn&#x27;t take that much - so it does last.  It&#x27;s also great to put a tiny bit in the ends and leave it.  No tangles! It just gives your hair a luxurious feel and my scalp even feels fantastic.  I have highlighted hair that tends to get dry - Love my Kerastase!</li>
    <li> Make sure to read the ingredients before you buy - this product contains Isopropyl alcohol as one of its main ingredients, which is a petroleum-derived substance that is used in antifreeze, wood finish and a solvent in shellac. It is drying and will&lt;br /&gt;dehydrate your hair, causing you to think you need more of the product when in fact it is the product itself that is drying out your hair slowly.</li>
    <li> I have thick, slightly wavy hair, and needed some moisture and shine.  So I thought this expensive product would help me achieve that. Unfortunately I do not see much improvement.  My hair feel smooth the day I use it but that&#x27;s about it.  I have been using it for a few months now and I hope it will improve as time goes on.  Will I purchase this kerastase nutritive masquintense again? I don&#x27;t think so.  I am sure it will work for others but it isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t do anything different than what any other good conditioner would do</li>
    <li> I have been using this mask for over six years, it is my secret weapon to repair my highlighted and colored hair. I tell everyone I know to use this stuff. I highly recommend this mask, I use it every week and love how soft and healthy my hair feels.</li>
    <li> Kerastase Masquintense is the product that introduced me to the Kerastase line.  From the very first time that a stylist used it on my thick, coarse,curly and color treated hair I knew that it would become a staple in my arsenal of hair care products.  I recall feeling that the masque made my hair seem like the hair I always wished I had (smooth, shiny and healthy) but never thought I&#x27;d be able to achieve.  And almost eight years later, I am pleased to report that my original assessment still holds.  This is still my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; product when I want my hair to look its best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for those whose hair is similar to mine because it is gentle while effectively conditionning damaged tresses.  It can be used with or without heat and can be left for as little as five minutes or as long as twenty.  When paired with Kerastase styling products, the results are sure to please.  And you will love the delightful frangrance that will linger for days after you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that Kerastase does not discontinue this wonderful product because I&#x27;ll certainly continue to use it from this day forward until \\&quot;the end of recorded time.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> My hair is  dry and damaged. I bleach it, and blow dry, etc...this masque makes my hair feel so soft. it is amazing. I will only buy these products for now on even though they are expensive, it is worth it.</li>
