<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I Purchased this product for my wife and the product is not the problem but the misleading information is my issue.  Many people asked how many boxes you get when you order this product and for the most part everyone said 6.  This is not the case. When our purchase arrived it was only one.  We also took into consideration the product details which states the following:&lt;br /&gt;Product Details&lt;br /&gt;Product Dimensions: 3.2 x 2.2 x 10.2 inches&lt;br /&gt;Shipping Weight: 4 pounds (View shipping rates and policies)&lt;br /&gt;ASIN: B001E0VWT8&lt;br /&gt;UPC: 661176010905&lt;br /&gt;Item model number: 224188&lt;br /&gt;If you see four pounds as the weight then there should be more than one box.&lt;br /&gt;Again my complaint is not for the product but the misleading information on the order page.</li>
    <li> Excellent merchant. Well packaged and fast delivery. I prefer ammonia free hair dyes&lt;br /&gt;such as this one.  The product comes with its own shampoo and conditioner  Leaves&lt;br /&gt;hair with a nice shine and rich color. Does a great job without the use of ammonia&lt;br /&gt;that really damages the hair.</li>
    <li> Have used this product before and have paid 2 times as much, so was happy to see it on line.  It came quickly and so far correctly, hoping all packages are like the first with correct ingredients.  Very pleased with purchasing this way.  Its easier and cost effective.&lt;br /&gt;The product is very good and the purchase experience from Amazon as well.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dye ever. The color is beautiful, it leaves my hair shiny and soft. No one realizes I color my hair. This product doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my scalp or skin. I would never use anything else. The company is really great about shipping out asap.</li>
    <li> The order indicated &amp;#34;6-pack&amp;#34; but I received one pack instead of six pack.:(</li>
    <li> Great product have been using for years this is a terrific deal on the price.</li>
    <li> My wife thinks this is the best product -- I really don&#x27;t know--but she said she&#x27;s happy with Naturtint since it&#x27;s healthier than other hair products due to the chemical composition--some hair colors use ammonia.  So I guess it gets 5 stars. The delivery was good.</li>
    <li> This is my go to hair dye.  I have been using it for several years.  Great color for me.  Color lasts 3-4 weeks.</li>
    <li> This is much better than the standard Drug Store chain versions. It does not trigger scalp itching, and it has a very mild odor. It also covers gray exceedingly well. This is the only brand of hair dye that I will use from now on.</li>
    <li> No nasty chemical smell,  Gradually fades out--colours run dark.  I&#x27;ve been grey as a mule since 18 so I&#x27;m pretty sold on this product!</li>
    <li> Natural, healty, not expences! All in one &#x3D; Naturtint permanent hair color!!!&lt;br /&gt;I recomand this produs ti all of You becouse  of that facts whrite above!</li>
    <li> This is the only brand I use that won&#x27;t cause me any reaction.  Plus the price is much better than retail.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years. I&#x27;m very happy with it. I get a great result without the burning/stinging chemicals.</li>
    <li> Just as promised with prompt delivery. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have use  Naturtint Perm hair coloring  for several years. Although the color only last for 2 weeks this product is still my preference. My hair look, feel, and smell  great when I use this product.</li>
    <li> Used it for 4 months, easy to use, long last result, less harm to your hair. Better than the L&#x27;Oreal New Excellence Hair Color</li>
    <li> No foul odor, works great to cover greys (you have to leave it on a little longer than regular dye) but it&#x27;s worth it, because there&#x27;s no ammonia smell.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair silky soft and natural. Is not harsh on scalp and color does not fade between uses .</li>
    <li> very good product. Prompt delivery</li>
    <li> My friend recommended it to me. I tried once so far and had very pleasant experience. I think it deserves to recommend to my friends and others.</li>
    <li> Revised review July 2015:  I&#x27;ve used this product for a while now and I am just elated!  I&#x27;m amazed how well it works.  The shine on your hair is beautiful. My hair looks super healthy. I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments with this product than any salon or over the counter color I have ever used.  You must leave it on twice as long but its okay because without the ammonia its not itchy and doesn&#x27;t stink.  No parabens, no resorcinol, no silicone, no parafin, no heavy metals, no artificial fragrances, no formaldehyde.  *** IMPORTANT!! One thing I do need to add is I use a non toxic shampoo and I STRONGLY believe this is why my color lasts soooo long. I go 3 months with out reapplying.  My non toxic products you cannot buy through amazon, its only through product consultants but again i STRONGLY recommend trying a non toxic shampoo...not just to help your color last long but because its the healthiest choice overall.    If you want to know the name of the non toxic chemical shampoo I use please email me.  crisso.ava@gmail.com  First review: I really thought this wouldn&#x27;t work because of the lack of chemicals used to set the color in but I am truly amazed.  I did leave in the color about twice as long as I normally did with my other amonia/toxic brands.</li>
    <li> Purchasing this product in bulk will drop the price and it works well and lasts a good 3 weeks before fading naturally into your hair unlike a &amp;#34;permanent&amp;#34; tint which really looks weird because it wont fade so when you&#x27;re hair grows out it is very noticeable. This product fades nicely into your hair over time. For me my hair grows really fast so if I wanted full 100% coverage all the time I would have to do it every 20 days.</li>
    <li> Although I have not used my new batch yet with the lighter tint than my previous one, I have every confidence that this one also will measure up. I always look forward to using it because it makes me look 20 years younger. My hair looks fuller, shinier and perfect color every time. With every order of 6 boxes I take it down a notch with a lighter shade. Thank you Amazon for selling the Naturtint at an affordable price. My package arrived before the predicted dates and in great condition by USPS priority mail. I did not have to wait for it and waste my day. Thank you Naturtint for your seamless method of shipping and a fantastic trustful product.</li>
    <li> I buy this dye from Sprouts Market for upwards of $15 per box when on sale so this price was a no brainer.  Same product, six boxes.  Happy purchaser!</li>
    <li> I love this product because the color looks very natural and not like I colored it when I am in different lighting.  I&#x27;d love to try a shade lighter next time.  Excellent!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s longer lasting than any other product I have used, but in the long run, it dried my hair, and I lost a lot of hair. It&#x27;s hard to believe that a so called natural product would be so damaging. Disappointed and puzzled. But it is what it is. I switched to no amonia over the counter hair color.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair color!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife, who is Korean.  She likes it very much, and has been using it for years.  Her hair has turned white with age, but Naturtint covers the white completely.  She used to buy this product at Whole Foods, but they charge over $18 a box.  Since my wife uses about 4 boxes in a half year, buying six at a discounted price is a great buy.  She hasn&#x27;t experienced any of the product QC problems mentioned in other reviews.</li>
    <li> the product is perfect, but communication isn&#x27;t good</li>
    <li> Have used ALL professional products, Clairol, Wella, Schwarzkopf - this is the best. Plus can use what u need. So I get 2 applications per box. And it smells good.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Excellent product. Best price found by far!!</li>
    <li> For all the bad stuff that this hair color doesn&#x27;t contain its pretty miraculous. My hair comes out wonderfully every time.   Do be aware that the natural chestnut is really more like dark dark brown. I can&#x27;t imagine how dark the actually dark brown and black shades must look but Natural Chestnut is very close to natural black.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I have psoriasis and a very sensitive scalp and drugstore AND salon hair color aggravate my condition making life miserable. Once I started using Naturtint, my psoriasis actually goes into remission between colorings and life is good. I highly recommend this brand to anyone who suffers from psoriasis. I have also noticed that the color is much richer looking than the drugstore brands and lasts much longer between colorings. I will never go back to lady clairol, or be sucked into uber expensive salon visits. This stuff is FABULOUS!</li>
    <li> Great price. Fast service. I used to pay $17 for a package at the local natural food store. Now I can get 6 of them for $48, including shipping. I will order again.</li>
    <li> I buy it for my college in china ,she loves it ,and it is not available in china ,so she asks me buy it on amzon ,good quality quick delivery time ,recomendi it</li>
    <li> Very impressed by this hair color.  I don&#x27;t like the ammonia smell and the chemicals of all the other permanent hair color products out there.  This does not have a strong odor and is very friendly to your hair.  Colors well and looks natural.  Bought my first box at Whole Foods, too expensive there!  Amazon is a lot cheaper!</li>
    <li> The color is to dark for me.  It almost looks black instead of dark brown.</li>
    <li> The product is consistently good and is not harmful to my hair or scalp. For the price I think it is excellent value.</li>
    <li> Best product for grey coverage, natural look, very little fading well into 4 weeks +.&lt;br /&gt; if no sun exposure, then fading slight at 6 weeks+&lt;br /&gt; product includes everything needed.  first read about it in Vogue magazine !&lt;br /&gt; and very happy tried it---going now into 3rd year of use.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Works great without any harsh chemicals. Lasts for weeks without fading. With a natural product like this, nobody should be using the other stuff.</li>
    <li> Love it.  This color covers all of my gray.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using nature tint in 4n for years, it covers grey completely, doesn&#x27;t fade so I never need to pull the color through to my ends. The box comes with everything you need including gloves, one use shampoo and conditioner and a bottle you can use to apply to your hair. It out performs the professional ammonia color I used to use!</li>
    <li> My shipment only came with 1 box instead of 6. The shipping weight is wrong on this product and should be changed.</li>
    <li> I been using 4N for over year now.&lt;br /&gt;Inside bottle renew at this time.&lt;br /&gt;I put this product for over hour every time.&lt;br /&gt;Usually only once enough to color on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;But not this time.&lt;br /&gt;I color twice at this time.&lt;br /&gt;Because it doesn&#x27;t good color like all last years.&lt;br /&gt;So I thought my worked doesn&#x27;t really good and I did color next day for over hour again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See pictures. It is not clearly to see my pics.&lt;br /&gt;But white hair still there&lt;br /&gt;I using professional tool for hair color when I do it my self.&lt;br /&gt;Look my picture..., such a poor job !!!!&lt;br /&gt;I need to return 2 more boxes !!!!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use any more!!!</li>
    <li> Great product and best deal!</li>
    <li> Naturtint Permanent Hair Color - 4N Natural&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for over a year and I have no complaint.  I am allergic to the other hair colors but Naturtint does not bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cory</li>
    <li> The package came very fast with 6 boxes of the color that I choose.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my order because even with the shipping fees the price it&#x27;s just perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I am using this product since February 2014 and I love it. I am very picky with the hair colors since my hairs are very thin and delicate. This product do not contain ammonia, it doesn&#x27;t smell and its covers grey hairs very well. I have to add that I realized that the color may last more than 3 weeks if you use also the Nutrideep Multiplier,  which is the cream that comes with the color and the shampoo in the box. It really helps to fix and last the color.</li>
    <li> I tried many others and from time to time I have ventured away from this product but I always return. It is the best.</li>
    <li> I have no idea since I bought this for someone else.</li>
    <li> Feel very natural though I hope the information about the ingredients can be revealed more.</li>
    <li> Great!!! My wife loves it!</li>
    <li> Always gets here on time and a great product, although when my hair gets a little longer it is barely enough to cover it all, but thankfully I only do the roots most of the time and then just rub it around onto the rest.</li>
    <li> Natural Ingredients, gives good shade for your hair with shine. Good price too. Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret :-)</li>
    <li> First product that doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using naturtint for several years.  It doesn&#x27;t have the harsh chemicals and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair like some products. It&#x27;s a great price on amazon. I used to pay $17 for 1 box at whole foods. It&#x27;s a great product and I have received compliments on my hair.</li>
    <li> I love the color. It works great for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it has no odor and doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my scalp as other store brands did. The color is long lasting and covers the grey. It is a little expensive as I need to color my hair every two weeks. But the advantage of no allergic reaction is worth the price.</li>
    <li> Naturtint is perfect.  I am not allergic to it, and I have had no serious reactions at all.  Your hair feels great even several weeks later.  It matches my natural shade to a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I buy these for an elderly friend. She keeps using it and seems to like it. She also appreciates the natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair product for over five years.&lt;br /&gt;Great price on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is the most natural hair color I&#x27;ve bought. No chemical smell and covers the gray well.&lt;br /&gt;I take the product to my hairdresser, less messy this way plus she knows how to apply it well!</li>
    <li> Second time the I buy the 6 packs box. The product is the same that you can find at Whole Foods for 16-18$. The quality of the hair color is very good. I use it more than one year and my thin hair are very happy with that. In order to lust the color I suggest to use Naturtint - Nutrideep Multiplier, it really helps and make your hair soft.</li>
    <li> One out of six boxes had two hair colorant and no color developer. Another box, the hair developer was half full and watery. This occurred even though all of the packing were delivered factory sealed.This means I got four usable packages but now I&#x27;m wondering what is the quality of these units; Are they factory rejects?</li>
    <li> Very happy, thank you.</li>
    <li> Nice natural looking color. No strong chemical smell. However the color faded too fast within 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> All hair Color products cause bad allergic reaction to my sculp. But Naturtint Hair Color causes very little allergic reaction. So I am happy about this product.  I think it is safe to use this product continuously for a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this hair coloring product. There is little to no smell, it doesn&#x27;t stain my skin the way most hair colors do, and the color lasts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Naturtint for a long time because it does a great job of covering my grey hair. People are always telling me how shiny my hair is!</li>
    <li> One box was ruined when it arrived</li>
    <li> Good product ! I have purchased  this many time</li>
    <li> long lasting, mild on hair and scalp, I have dye sensitivity and this is the best so far.</li>
    <li> However, you have to use a good shampoo and conditioner when washing the hair, otherwise, it is difficult do wash the hair, it feels kind of dry and sticky.  I have normal hair.  I use shampoo that is organic and is for color treated hair.  If you use shampoo over the counter, it doesn&#x27;t work too well.  I know this hair color product is supposed to be all natural, but the ingredient makes the hair feels kind of strange.  At least that&#x27;s my experience so far, after use the product twice already.  Other than that, this product works for me.</li>
    <li> I use this product for 8 years and very happy with result.</li>
    <li> I feel I am so lucky to have this product. The hair dye products I used before not only had bad smell but also damaged my hair and caused itching on my scalp. This is a natural hair dye, The smell is good, does not damage my hair and does not cause any itching. It is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Wow! This is the best hair color I have ever used. Covers the gray and looks so natural!</li>
    <li> Been using for YEARS. I will never go back to the chemical-loaded hair colors soaking into my scalp/body. This is great stuff and covers all my gray.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Has no strong smelling chemical, very gentle  for the hair.  Use it to touch up grey roots and am satisfied that it does the job quite well.</li>
    <li> Excellent produce use it only &amp; hope to buy from Naturtint exclusively ! Great coverage &amp; lasts long using Naturtint shampoo Also excellent delivery time !</li>
    <li> Received a damaged box and they refunded me. Love this hair color! Been using it for years because it&#x27;s SAFE! And this is an amazing price compared to the $18 per box I was paying at my local natural foods store.</li>
    <li> Great color. Covers grey completely. Most colors only turn the grey red but this color actually colors it brown. I like that it has no ammonia or parabens.</li>
