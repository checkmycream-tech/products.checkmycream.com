<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Everyone should have this. It&#x27;s over all a good product that kills skin-eating viruses, and as well as other germs. Washing with it once a week should be recommended even on a healthy individual. Also good for scrapes and cuts.</li>
    <li> I was so happy I bought this after my surgery. It worked well and I was infection free. I have continued to use this product afterwards when taking a shower and washing my hands.</li>
    <li> Essential for anyone exposed to MRSA!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product if u ever had Mrsa infection and you want to keep from breaking out this is the product to get I caught the infection from a baby and kept breaking out but ever since I started using this product no break out it as being year since my last. Break out and I can wear all my short skirt and short because of it it clears it up and some how the spots just vanishes from off my skin love it will always. Buy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve started using this daily due to getting boils on inner thigh...works like a charm.  Must use daily though.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted but the shipping cost more than the product.</li>
    <li> works well good product</li>
    <li> This is a great product, got rid of my infection in 3 days</li>
    <li> Excellent bacteria killing body wash, helps prevent rashes and body odors caused by bacteria.  I use it as a final wash after normal body soap for my underarms.  Works well for me.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Whenever we have cuts or gashes, first thing we use to clean the wound is hibiclens.</li>
    <li> This was suggested by my dermatologist to cure acne on buttocks of my kids.  Worked perfectly!</li>
    <li> Excellent  wound care product.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping  Great item</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It seemed a bit watery and I don&#x27;t remember the consistency being that thin.</li>
    <li> I often find myself frustrated by reviewers who give a product a poor rating based off of quality of service, not the actual product. I now understand why this happens. This is not a review based on the quality of the product more so the decision to ship a product that has an expiry date 1/2015 for a product that arrive 10/14. I purchased this product with the intention to add it to a first aid kit and had hoped I wouldn&#x27;t need to replace it for at least 12 months.</li>
    <li> Great price.  Must cheaper by prime than in the local drugstore.</li>
    <li> Received my product early and well packaged! Came in sealed and in original box! This soap works wonders for my husbands athletes foot and if I notice I am getting a little red around my peircings, I use once or twice and it clears it right up!  Plus you get a bigger bottle than you would find at the store for around the same price!  So, that is a bonus! Only problem is we go through it so fast..</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Competitive price.</li>
    <li> I am in college and I use this because of all the germs present in shared spaces. I notice I get sick significantly less when I use this product. I use twice a day, morning and night. I also study biology and I did a culture on my hands before and after and there was absolutely no growth after using this product.</li>
    <li> Showering with this product is mandated by our local hospital prior to day surgery. I highly recommend reading the instructions and warnings before use. Otherwise it does the job well and smells decent for this type of product. I had no skin irritation and there was no lingering smell.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s in good shape when received</li>
    <li> This product arrived opened and leaked all over the bottle and inside the envelope.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and as advertised. Thanks</li>
    <li> very useful, my husband was very happy</li>
    <li> After spending time in a hospital with a sick family member I was diagnosed with MRSA.  Went to a specialist who recommended showering with Dial antibacterial and Hibiclens... I&#x27;ve been abscess free for months now.</li>
    <li> I own a goat farm. I get covered in goat crap every day when working outside and this product is amazing at disinfecting my skin after working outside. I tried using antibacterial soaps but they really just didn&#x27;t work all the time. I could clean my whole body and would still not be clean enough. Hibiclens is excellent and lasts a very long time in the shower.</li>
    <li> Just what the Doctor ordered (literally) for me to use prior to surgery.</li>
    <li> Helped with boils in my armpit. Wasn&#x27;t a miracle or anything.</li>
