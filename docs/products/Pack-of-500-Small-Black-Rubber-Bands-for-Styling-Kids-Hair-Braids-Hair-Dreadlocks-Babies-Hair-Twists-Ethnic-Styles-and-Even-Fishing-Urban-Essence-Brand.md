      <li>You can find at the beauty store for 99cents but for the convenience of online shopping its okay priced i guess.</li>

      <li>they come in atiny container box which is just cute</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very nice. Average delivery wait and they came in a nice little plastic container rather than the bag as shown on the page.</li>
    <li> I use these to tie my hair up. These are not as sturdy as I&#x27;d like them to be - they generally break after two uses or so, and generally feel flimsy. They do stretch out a lot, but will stayed stretched out. Some of the bands are great, but some are thin and break as soon as you try to use them. Needless to say, there ARE 500 of them, so it doesn&#x27;t make that much of a difference if you&#x27;re only planning on using 1 a day anyways.</li>
    <li> I purchased these so that when i cornrow the front of my head they could hold the cornrows in place, like the other reviews said, they pop very easy. Maybe mine was a bad batch but i doubled them just in case and they all still popped within a few minutes of putting them in my hair. Not a good product at all.</li>
    <li> Works great for my granddaughters and one has very thin hair and the other has thick. Great product.</li>
    <li> Very horrible.  Constantly breaks</li>
    <li> Snags on the way off. My toddler doesn&#x27;t let me use it on her...wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for kids&#x27; hair.</li>
    <li> These stay in my daughter&#x27;s hair. Yay!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually put my hair up. I got these for when I go to bed and I want to braid my hair and go to bed, or when I am doing certain styles, they help hold my hair in certain ways that I want them. These work great. They are small and sturdy. When I stretch them, they don&#x27;t feel flimsy. I have medium thick long hair - these work just fine. I will buy again once I run out but because you get sooo much, it might be a while.</li>
    <li> Perfect except for the fact they get soft quickly.</li>
    <li> Too small for general use, but very strong.</li>
    <li> Stillll nooot heeeere.</li>
    <li> I had these mini black rubber bands b4 in another brand.  I liked them b/c my granddaughter wears black often (so they match) &amp; they&#x27;re perfect to hold small ponytails or a braid in a child&#x27;s fine, soft hair.  But these are not like the others I had.  These are much thinner &amp; weaker.  If I stretch them just a tad too much, they snap.  The others I had, were much more sturdy &amp; rarely ever snapped.  If I had known these were so fragile, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought them.  They will hold a braid at the bottom, or a ponytail on just the front section of a child&#x27;s hair but I wouldn&#x27;t put my granddaughters med. length, straight hair in one...it would surely break.</li>
    <li> These are great rubber bands!! They are very stretchy and good. They are small looking (what I was looking for). The shipping was fast and I will use them for fish bags will buy some later on.</li>
    <li> Yes it is a very good product i buy these all the time at dollar tree for a dollar. So im kinda shocked to see it on for $5.00</li>
    <li> Now I won&#x27;t be losing this for a good amount of time. There&#x27;s so many! haha</li>
    <li> These rubber bands were literally breaking and snapping off my daughter&#x27;s head. I had to keep redoing the style hoping they would stay. Maybe I got a bad batch, but this was ridiculous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never experienced this even with less expensive rubber bands. What a joke.</li>
    <li> It is ok with this price. very thin but good price in term of quantity. I ultimately bough an another one which will last longer</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve bought these a few times for my toddler&#x27;s hair. The last batch we received snap very easily. Won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> When I first started to use them they seemed way too stretchy and I kept thinking they would break. They are super thin.  What I thought was a problem turned out to be a great advantage. I braid my hair in really small braids, because they streach so much it made them very easy to use and they are thin enough that I am able to hide the rubber band inside the beads and so far not a single one has broken while ive be using them. Ill definantly be buying more of these.</li>
    <li> I use these for my hair and they work fine. Braids and styling - not pony tails with a full head of hair!  I would never expect them to be anything but disposable, one use. If I mess up and try to re-use them, they are usually stretched out. A few have broken when I try to stretch them to use them, but less than 10%.</li>
    <li> This product is great, just what I was looking for to tie my hair up, only when I recieved it, they were completely out of the little bag and in the box. That&#x27;s ridiculous! I had to dig through the 500 rubber bands in the box so I could put them in a ziploc baggie. I paid $6.00 or so for these. They could at least be in appropriate packaging...</li>
    <li> Not made of real rubber. If you use oil in your hair, the band will immediately erode and snap within 5 minutes</li>
    <li> I usually just use these little rubber bands when I braid my hair, or other styles I might need these for. They&#x27;re very stretchy, and if you take them out with care you can even reuse them a few times. Good price for 500 of these!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve got hair like my little J, then you need these! I use a scissor to cut them out of her hair because pulling them hurts her, even though I&#x27;m not yanking them out. And for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> So strong I can reuse them</li>
    <li> Buyer beware!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These bands are cheap and literally comes apart in your hand! They are poorly made and should not be sold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could give zero stars, I would !</li>
    <li> These are very good quality for the their size.  I purchased some from the dollar store that were much to thin.  These hold up.</li>
    <li> These are exactly how I like my elastics to be. They are small but have very good stretch with out breaking. They come out easy, Although I usually use fingernail clippers to break them to take them out!</li>
    <li> We would love to suggest using a hemp bag as plastic is toxic and we have cut enough trees down on this planet!</li>
    <li> Very happy. But I do have one little I rhought that they would come in a little bag but they came in a plastic box which sucks. But I&#x27;m gonna be okay. Don&#x27;t let that one thing hurt you from buying the product.</li>
    <li> These rubber bands turned out to be worthless. I don&#x27;t know whether it was just this batch or maybe it&#x27;s my hair cream, but these things snap 2 minutes after I put them in. I don&#x27;t even have to touch them, they just break on their own.</li>
    <li> these rubber bands are too small and they do not stretch much.They even break very fast.I am not happy with my purchase.:-((</li>
    <li> These are THE WORST elastics! They break even before I can get them into my daughters&#x27; hair (ages 4 &amp; 6). Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have dread locks and need strong rubber bands for guiding my dreads. These rubber bands are not as strong as I would like and I do not use them as much as I had anticipated. They would likely work for styling hair for little girls.</li>
    <li> These are NOT the type of rubber pants for kids - they are not &amp;#34;ouch proof&amp;#34;. They literally feel like an actual elastic..</li>
    <li> Loooooove these bands! Get more than one use put of, don&#x27;t stretch like clear cheap plastic ones I have. Use on 2 year olds fine hair &amp; stays in all day. Definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> Some bands are larger than others... some bands are thinner around the circle and thicker on other parts so easy to snap, do not retain size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are using these as a 1-time usage, go for them, but a little expensive for what they are.</li>
    <li> Guys,&lt;br /&gt;Please read this review before making a decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item several months ago as an &amp;#34;ADD ON ITEM&amp;#34; and I had no complaints. In fact I purchased more than one units.&lt;br /&gt;The rubber bands worked as expected. So I planned to &amp;#34;ORDER AGAIN&amp;#34; the same item from my order history and that was a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product that I received as a part of reordering is super cheap and very low quality. The rubber bands are very weak. They break and even slip away or do not hold in position. I tried to use more than one bands to see if that holds, but it does not. When it breaks, it breaks into many pieces. Something is horribly wrong with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is over-priced as mentioned by another reviewer. Try looking for another comparable item. Am sure one could find something at a much better price and better quality.</li>
    <li> These bands were totally useless. They kept breaking! Will never buy these again</li>
    <li> these are too thin for what I use them for but they can hold small constructs together so a three star is enough.</li>
    <li> I love these for sectioning, oiling, and braiding my infant daughter&#x27;s hair. I put them on loosely at the ends while her hair is damp and when they dry, I take them off and am left with gentle curled ends. I anticipate these lasting a LONG time when I&#x27;m able to do many different styles. I&#x27;ve used themon myself for quick updos and fishtail braid styles.</li>
    <li> the dogs use these Never broke. They stay in place for weeks. Not sure what the complainers are going on about.&lt;br /&gt;they work great for both dogs and all the shenanigans they get into. maybe these people are doing more then rolling around in the dirt and batting at it with their &amp;#34;paws&amp;#34; and dealing with thousands of petting&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I love these for tying up my extensions into lots. It&#x27;s much easier than wrapping string over and over. They are sturdy enough to hold sets of 100s or more. Yes, I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is the type of product that you pretty much can&#x27;t go wrong with. It won&#x27;t be good or bad, it&#x27;ll be exactly what you expected.&lt;br /&gt;These are great for braids and small styles. Of course, the size of the rubber bands make them easily breakable if you try and use them for large chunks of your hair.</li>
    <li> These rubber bands are the normal small black rubber bands.  I don&#x27;t think there is high quality or low quality rubber bands.  They do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would however advise anyone who is thinking of buying these. First, the price is higher than most others.  There is NO reason why they should be since they are not superior in quality.  Also, if you do buy, do not use the seller \\&quot;b2books\\&quot;  They sent me an empty ripped open rubber band bag, with the rubber bands thrown in a huge unsealed plastic bag. Instead of 500 rubber bands, there were 419.</li>
    <li> GREAT SELLER!  GREAT PRICE!  GREAT SHIPPING!  WILL BUY AGAIN!!!!</li>
    <li> The worst ever!  I&#x27;m only giving 1 star because I have to.  They deserve a negative star.  They pop and break all day long while in your hair, I have never experienced this before.  They are cheap and crappy!  Don&#x27;t waste your time with these rubber bands they are awful!!</li>
    <li> rubber is best! great for braiding</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly for dreading my hair. They&#x27;re very strong and I only had a few break after they had been in my hair for several weeks.</li>
    <li> They work, but they get tangled in her hair more easily than others.</li>
    <li> If you have an EVF or OVF that doesn&#x27;t lock into the hot-shoe tightly, these elastic bands are the perfect size to help improve the grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a bonus - also comes with the funniest product ID number I&#x27;ve seen to date - X000****7R.  Hilarious!</li>
    <li> Use them for wacky rigging a plastic worm for fishing instead of paying a premium.</li>
    <li> I love these bands because they have really good elasticity. A lot of smaller bands like these barely stretch at all and can be really difficult to use, but not these ones.</li>
    <li> These rubber bands are horrible! I tried to use them to braid my daughters hair and noticed that they were breaking in her hair before I could even finish the braid. The quality is very poor and I wasn&#x27;t able to style her hair or use them for anything because they would just break a few seconds later.</li>
    <li> These are somewhat disappointing and represent the last time that I buy hair bands from Amazon. I didn&#x27;t give them a total fail score because they will do the job, but they are not what I expected. These are literally small, black, rubber bands intended to hold your hair when it&#x27;s long. Thing is they literally are RUBBER - which sometimes hurts the hair, and are just a bit bigger than those bands some kids have to put on their braces. The package was even ripped open and the bands were spilled when I opened the box. The good news is is that they weren&#x27;t really expensive but if you&#x27;re looking for comfortable black bands to hold your hair take the time to go to the drug store and get a set you like.</li>
    <li> they come in atiny container box which is just cute(: and they are very durable. i use these with my extensions and they work!</li>
    <li> thank you for being precise with shipping and tracking information. the quality of the rubber bands are great too. i was worried i would get a bag of rubber bands that break easily but not at all.</li>
    <li> This is just something that I needed to meet the free shipping amount. It is a product that I use for my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair, so they will not go to waste.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husbands very thin ponytail hoping they would hold the small amount without tearing. They worked very well, are not too thick to stretch to put on, nor too thin that they break. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I hate it when rubber bands POP and my daughter hates it too. The dollar store rubber bands were leaving rubber  band pies in her bed and I get so tired of redoing her hair because the bands pop.</li>
    <li> the rubbers are very good and durable i use em very often very satisfied good product&lt;br /&gt;for whatever use you need em they will last long</li>
    <li> These arrived pretty quickly:) Great value for the price! I use them to tie up my terriers hair. They come out easily and are strong enough to last between styling. If you have thin hair I also think they would work for humans.</li>
    <li> Good price for a bunch of great quality hair elastics that don&#x27;t break easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing worse than finishing a wiggly little girl&#x27;s hair style only to turn around to see that the elastic holding it together has broken and you have to start over!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have that problem with these and I&#x27;m so happy to say that! :D</li>
    <li> I love these!!! I only use 2 everytime I do my hair and the two rubberband survive until I need to do my hair again.</li>
    <li> Works great for keeping my dog&#x27;s hair out of their eyes!</li>
    <li> I used these for my 20 month old daughter&#x27;s pony tails. Great elastics. I&#x27;ve used some that once you take them out, they lose all their stretching ability but these spring back really well so you can use them more than once.</li>
    <li> Put my hear in six braids for a marathon and these held up them in for over 4 days and two washes. Sturdy!</li>
    <li> Awful!! They are very thin which causes them to break very easy. Even after using two they still snap.</li>
    <li> Horrible. Don&#x27;t buy. They break as fast as you put them in. Literally just used 5 in thirty seconds they break so easily. Ridiculous</li>
    <li> We needed bands for peoples&#x27; hair in my office as it gets in the way.  These are tiny but I guess they&#x27;ll do the job...or so my staff says...</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re pretty good for what I need but do tend to break.  (I&#x27;m tying off henna cones and need to roll the band down to tighten as I use  up the paste, this is when it breaks).</li>
    <li> I like these bands because they don&#x27;t really rip out my little girl&#x27;s hair. I like that since I&#x27;m not very good at styling girls hair.</li>
    <li> They do break pretty easily, some are thinner than others. I&#x27;ve used about 100, and only had about 5 break, so a great deal- there are 400 more!</li>
    <li> Just what we needed!  These are nice and thick rubber bands that don&#x27;t feel cheap at all!</li>
    <li> I tried using them as regular hair ties for my ponytail but they instantly snapped. Granted, I have super thick hair but these snaps very easily.  I will continue to use them for smaller braids.</li>
    <li> Perfect for fun hairstyles on long or short hair</li>
    <li> got it on time and they are great</li>
    <li> Very useful and it does not break easily like other rubberbands.</li>
    <li> These are great to do everything listed in the description.I used them to style and braid and there&#x27;s so many of them, that you don&#x27;t need to save these. It is hard to remove, as it does not stretch very well, which can be a painful and difficult process. But since there is a lot, you could cut them off, but again, not very ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are pretty small, which is good for styling and such, but the quality is mediocre. It is relatively sturdy, but not flexible enough to do larger pieces of hair, and thus, makes removing them hard.</li>
    <li> I do lots of research prior to making any purchases. These are better than dollar store brands because they are easy to work with. My one year old&#x27;s hair doesn&#x27;t pull in these and yet they also stay put. They are small but the elastic is great quality so you can wrap them several times and they won&#x27;t break. I can even reuse them.</li>
    <li> I use these to bead my daughter&#x27;s hair.  I like them because they blend in with her hair color and do not distract from the beads.  We can see the beads and the bands are mostly hidden.  They stretch well and are hard to break.  They also last in her hair through several weeks and washings without getting weak or brittle.</li>
    <li> Yea I love these. Out of all the different rubber bands I have bought these break the least. They stay in untill I take them out which means alot because I have experience with other ones breaking while in my daughter&#x27;s hair and ruining her style.</li>
    <li> i was actually surprised how thick and durable these are.  The last set I bought were pretty crappy but these don&#x27;t break very easily and have a nice feel to them.  I think I might die before I use 500 of them but if I do survive the use of all 500 I will certainly order more</li>
    <li> I use these to secure the braids in my daughters hair and they work incredibly.  They are also good for crafts or anything else needing a small rubber band to secure to.</li>
    <li> My 7-yr old daughter competes in gymnastics meets so we have to put her hair back.  Her hair is fine--so it is hard to contain-- so I end up putting her hair in several braids and combine them in the center for a pony tail.  Sometimes I just do a lot of little ponies criss-crossing.  These rubber bands are great for either choice.  I can use them for the little pony tails and for the big thick pony in the middle.  I haven&#x27;t had any break yet.  I&#x27;m pretty happy with these.</li>
    <li> Excellent bands for tightening braids between dos.  Sturdy enough for good hold, thin enough not to be noticed and who cares if they break easily when being removed.  With so many for the small price they are a great value.</li>
    <li> I like that these are thicker. They tend to not move around as much in my toddler&#x27;s hair compared to the thinner ones. She has very fine hair and it holds well.</li>
    <li> They are OKAY bands, not as good as some others I have purchased. One out of five maybe? or so break. So I have to grab more than I need when doing the kiddo&#x27;s hair. It can be frustrating when I finally have the hair braided and BAM! the band breaks.  BUT for the price of a penny each, I guess that&#x27;s what you get!</li>
    <li> These rubber bands keep popping out of my daughter&#x27;s hair! Upset I spent $5 on them!</li>
    <li> Excellent price for the amount of rubber bands. They seem to be very rugged.I did have quite a delay in shipping but that seemed to be a fluke. My sister ordered hers and got them within days.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, love the product and would buy again.  I use this to braid my daughter&#x27;s hair after her shower so it&#x27;s wavy the next morning, they are 7 and 9 and love curls.  I did find them for a dollar or two at Dollar General, but if you&#x27;re too busy to go to the store, this is fast and easy.</li>
    <li> We bought this for pony tails for my daughter. The rubber bands are having good elasticity and we are able to use the bands more than once. Good value for money</li>
    <li> I actually love these.  I have fairly fine, long hair.  They hold very well in my hair and I have never had one break which is amazing as most bands do (often when they are in my hair).  I have absolutely no regrets about buying these rubber bands and use them almost every day.</li>
    <li> These are great for braiding my daughter&#x27;s hair.  I had some rubber bands before, but when they ran out I tried the silicon ones from the store.  Those were terrible -- they broke within days!  The place I used to get rubber bands from before doesn&#x27;t have them anymore, so I was happy to find these on Amazon.  They&#x27;ve been in for about 3 weeks now and none of them have broken (I use one at the base and one at the end).  Love them, and will definitely buy more!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t buy anywhere for this perfect rubber band for my hair.  The rubber band that you can buy is not the same type of this traditional rubber band which offers you the ultimate flexibility of rubber.</li>
    <li> I use these to make you sponge daubers to do scapbooking and card making great size just rite to use with thin craft foam sheets.</li>
    <li> Very strong and holds my daughters hair well</li>
    <li> Excellent elasticity and quality. I use to organize ribbon.  Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> These rubber bands served the purpose. They didn&#x27;t break as fast as others I&#x27;ve purchased locally. Thanks for a good product.</li>
    <li> what can I say, they are rubber bands..exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> They break!!! Sucks. I had my daughters hair all nice and pretty and after only 30 mins, it snapped so my daughter was walking around with a crazy hair.  This happens about 3 times until I had to use 4 rubber bands at a time. Cheap.</li>
    <li> I own a salon/spa and we provide free haircuts for those that want to donate their hair to Locks of Love.  These little bands work great for that purpose.</li>
    <li> These rubber bands break easily and for no reason, although they do stretch quite a lot it doesn&#x27;t really matter because they&#x27;ll end up breaking anyways. It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Break all the time very poor quality do not buy</li>
    <li> These rubberbands are wonderful. They do not get stuck in my hair the way the Wal-Mart ones did.</li>
    <li> Great buy. Using them on old watch bands. Thank You..</li>
    <li> Very strong rubber bands! I have thick hair and was able to wrap the band 3 times around me ponytail.</li>
    <li> Great product, I use these in my children&#x27;s hair and they don&#x27;t break like most brands.  They are also reusable, which is great!</li>
    <li> perfect price and durable for the purpose of wrapping cleaning cloths around cleaning bottles.  Will continue to buy in future.</li>
    <li> Handy dandy! These small rubber bands are perfect for little kids&#x27; hair or those styles that have lots of small, fiddly bits (like tiny braids or lots of little alien-buns). They do break, so you can&#x27;t wind them too tight! But when you have 500, one broken one isn&#x27;t going to ruin your day...</li>
    <li> Prior to buying these, we bought similar ones from wal-mart and target to use for our toddler&#x27;s hair. The ones we used to buy usually broke - sometimes when putting them on, and most often when we took them off. If they didn&#x27;t break, they were unusable because they were stretched out double or triple the original size. Furthermore, they often got tangled and caught in my daughter&#x27;s hair. In comparison, these rubber bands are extremely more durable! I can typically reuse them 1 more time as they do not expand as easily as the other ones I&#x27;ve bought. They come off easily too. I will definitely buy these again once my supply is up.</li>
    <li> I got these for my dreads and they snag a lot. Otherwise they are really good for other types of hair styles because they stay in forever.</li>
    <li> i bought these black rubber bands for my one year old daughter&#x27;s hair. They arrived on time, i emptied the bands in a ziplock bag to store them as the bag they come in is (obviously) not proficient for storage. the bands smell like old bicycle tires. the worst part is how much hair these bands rip out. my poor girl cried when i put the bands in, and i have ripped out large amounts of hair when removing the bands. i did not have any problem with ouchless baby hair bands that i previously used on her hair. I no longer use these black baands for my daughters hair. I now use these bands to tie the ends of my braids....but it will still grab and damage the ends of my hair.</li>
    <li> I needed maybe five of the five hundred that came in this pack. An embarrassment of riches. Maybe the other 495 of them will come in handy, or will replace the one or two that do immediately pop (and are useless).</li>
    <li> Strong elastic bands. I use them in my daughter&#x27;s THICK curly hair. This is my second purchase and it will NOT be my last.&lt;br /&gt;A must buy!</li>
    <li> Wife needed small bands for her doll maintenence. These will last a long time. Recommended for doll stying ++++ Buy</li>
    <li> Terrible.  Every rubber band in the bag breaks.  Do not buy these!</li>
    <li> You can find at the beauty store for 99cents but for the convenience of online shopping its okay priced i guess.</li>
    <li> Perfect - a simple product advertised correctly.  The rubber bands are strong - not cheap ones.  Plus, you truly get 500 - so it makes it tough to run out for a while.  All of them are sized the same - it is sort of tough to see that in the picture, but they are all the same size, which is nice.</li>
    <li> These rubber bands are so cheap.  Everyday I put them on my daughters ponytails and sent her off to school.  Everyday she would come home with no rubberbands in her hair since they would pop everyday while in her hair.  I finally ended up throwing the rest away.  Don&#x27;t waste your money if you want to use these on ponytails.</li>
