      <li>I&#x27;m VERY happy with my purchase and highly recommend these.</li>
      <li>and they bend out of shape very easily</li>
      <li>These combs are not well made, they are flimsy and break very easily.</li>
      <li>Other than that, Great product and great price!!</li>
      <li>A lot of combs fit good price.</li>
      <li>These are by far the best I have gotten.</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine and silver.</li>
      <li>I thought these were great the first time I tried</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have bought combs in years and these work great.</li>
      <li>Good if you are in a pinch, but it is worth it to pay more and get heavier, smoother plastic.</li>
      <li>My kids love them.</li>
      <li>There are much better brands.</li>
      <li>We were able to use cloth to personalize them and add color(s).</li>

      <li>I really love these clips.</li>
      <li>embroidery floss on the top edge for decoration.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t able to find them anywhere</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using them for more than a year and have no problems with them.  </li>
      <li>How many products can you say that about nowadays??</li>
      <li>They are more of a flexible plastic</li>
      <li>I would buy more.</li>
      <li>Best to do this out of doors so as not to set off a smoke alarm or breathe in an plastic fumes but an instant singe of the ends -- or a bit of filing with an emery board --</li>
      <li>Goody or Vidal Sasoon make better ones.</li>
      <li>They are not totally awful</li>
      <li>These are okay for the price.</li>
      <li>Nice colors but cheaply made.  </li>

      <li>I love these combs.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These do the job and have become almost impossible to find even at a beauty supply.  Glad to find them at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love the hair combs! They don&#x27;t break easily and holds my texlaxed hair in place. I didn&#x27;t rate it 5 stars only because of the color of the combs. Wish they had more black and brown. Other than that, Great product and great price!! Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> When Goody&#x27;s stopped making the hair combs that I have used for years, I was so disappointed. I held on tightly to the last four that I owned. Every time I bought another brand, they just didn&#x27;t feel right in my hair. Then I bought these, and I love them. If anything, they are better than the Goody&#x27;s. They are lighter weight and really stay put. Scunci has done a great job with these side combs. I bought two packs just so I would have them.</li>
    <li> Just when you thought combs were combs.  These are sturdy and don&#x27;t break easy like most.  The price and assortment of colors really make this a great deal.</li>
    <li> Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Not very sturdy. Not a good recommendation for thick hair. They are more of a flexible plastic so the combs bend out of shape than snap off</li>
    <li> Product as expected. I think I bought it online because it is cheaper than similar stuff in stores. I was sewing it on wigs to hold wigs in place. Working good. Price is good.</li>
    <li> These combs were better than I ever expected them to be! I never used a hair comb before and I wasn&#x27;t completely sold on how they worked and stayed in your hair, but man oh man these are awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a community theatre Costume Designer. These combs are perfect for sewing into hats and headpieces - I bought several packages. I haven&#x27;t seen them sold locally in a long time - thank-you Amazon!</li>
    <li> I bought these because I kept losing Bobby pins to pin my bangs on out of my face. I feel these don&#x27;t work with my hair. My bangs are side swept style. And are pretty long. They don&#x27;t stay in place. It could be just how I part my hair to be pulled back. Definitely practice and see what works. The hair combs are good quality, it&#x27;s just learning how to use them is difficult.</li>
    <li> I use these on a daily basis. I&#x27;ll lose them before they wear out or break.  For some reason I can&#x27;t find them in stores anymore, so am very grateful to find them here. I&#x27;m tired of driving around trying to locate them. I don&#x27;t have the time or the gas. I&#x27;ll just buy them online.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and are great quality, would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Good combs. Finally I found some that hold short hair well. YAY!&lt;br /&gt;Very good price. Will be buying more for the future as they seem to disappear. (4 females in the home)</li>
    <li> These are standard-sized hair combs and work like typical hair combs.  The plastic is stiffer than the combs I&#x27;ve bought in the past so I don&#x27;t expect these to last as long.  I&#x27;ve bought combs like this before and the teeth of the stiffer plastic tends to break more easily than the more pliable plastic like Goody (sp) brand uses.  I was actually looking for the longer combs (3\\&quot;) that Goody used to make, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find for about 15 years.</li>
    <li> I think the color selection is fantastic and will certainly come in handy. I&#x27;ve only had them a week but I&#x27;ve used the navy ones so far. When my hair is due for a relaxer, sliding a comb in proves difficult because of the undergrowth, especially with the last set of side combs I bought from a grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These work very well, they slide in nicely and when I remove them they don&#x27;t break my hair. They&#x27;re great so far and I recommend them; I&#x27;m only leaving one star off to see how they hold up.</li>
    <li> Nice quality, especially for the price. I also like the variety of colors. I would recommend buying these here versus in the store.</li>
    <li> These are subtle enough to wear on a daily basis whereas many others seem like they should only be worn on special occasions.</li>
    <li> I find them hard to use and not very convenient. They are not totally awful but i have them around just in case....</li>
    <li> I have found that these combs hold very well in my hair.  Easy to use, etc.</li>
    <li> I had doubt about this product because I have really thick hair. When it arrived I immediately tried a couple on and they worked perfectly!  On a slightly unrelated note, I did find this exact item at Walmart for about the same price. :)</li>
    <li> These combs are a lot cheaper on Amazon than I can find sets of 2 combs, not 12, in the local stores.  They are easy to use and have great holding power.  They almost never come loose.  They are plain with zero decoration, but at this price who cares?</li>
    <li> Some of the prongs broke already and it&#x27;s not smooth to put In</li>
    <li> It is so hard to find hair combs anymore, so tried Amazon, and based on other reviewed bought these.  Love them!  They&#x27;re a little shorter than the one other pair I&#x27;ve been holding onto, but they hold great. And what a fantastic price!</li>
    <li> I use these at the crown of my head for my wash and go style. I get tired of wearing headbands sometimes, so this is an alternative for my moderate twa.</li>
    <li> these were exactly what I wanted and I got them fast and my daughter and I decorated them to be so cute!</li>
    <li> These are better than I thought they would be. The combs are just flexible enough so they won&#x27;t break so easily, like some of the other ones I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> The variety of subtle colors as well as the matte finish on these make them a win for me.  I have thinning hair and these are a perfect size (not too large) and hold in the hair very well.  So glad I found them here!</li>
    <li> Staying power is fabulous with these combs.  I have fairly fine hair and just can&#x27;t bear it to be on my face.  These keep my hair pulled back very nicely and never fall out.  I&#x27;ve worn ONLY this brand for years.  I see with my new purchase, that they have reformulated the plastic and it has a bit more give (so I&#x27;m guessing they will last even longer).  However, they can be a bit sharp at first.  So, singe the ends with a flame.  Best to do this out of doors so as not to set off a smoke alarm or breathe in an plastic fumes but an instant singe of the ends -- or a bit of filing with an emery board -- will take that edge off perfectly.</li>
    <li> Great product sturdy very pretty  different pretty colors love it thank you very much for this transaction will buy again</li>
    <li> As expected. They are for thinner hair, which I do have. I bought these to catch fly aways. A good price.</li>
    <li> I remember using these constantly in the 80s to tease my bangs and hadn&#x27;t given much thought to them since then.  But as fate would have it, I was invited to a number of themed parties that required more intricate updos and I found myself searching for accessories that could do some heavy lifting.  These felt a bit too expensive, and I was especially thrown off by the varying prices and shipping options based on color, but when I surprisingly couldn&#x27;t find them at any brick and mortar store, I gave in to Amazon and ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And am so happy I did! They are sturdier than I expected - a must for my long hair.  If you&#x27;ve ever had a flimsy comb break during a frantic getting ready process, or worse: later on during the actual event, you understand my frustration with wimpy plastic. These are strong and hold wavy hair for hours.  I even found a way to work them into a Brigitte Bardot look for a wedding. So apparently you can achieve both classy and costumey hairstyles with these combs. Even the colors, of which I was skeptical (olive green?), work well and are pretty much camouflaged in my light brown hair. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Nice variety of combs for every day wear. The colors hold the hair in place and are good quality combs.</li>
    <li> I love these, they stay in place and hold my hair despite how thick and heavy it is.  Plenty of colors, too!</li>
    <li> They work great for the double sided combs that I have been making.</li>
    <li> Combs make such beautiful hair accessories. You can sew flowers to these for custom hair wear and save yourself a bundle. Great price and well made.</li>
    <li> I love these combs, I use them everyday and they are very supportive.  I have very thick, natural, shoulder length african american hair and it holds my hair well.  I&#x27;ve been using them for more than a year and have no problems with them.  I only wish they would sell a pack of all black combs since that&#x27;s the only color I use.  I hate having to buy the whole pack just for the black ones.  I do use the blue, dark brown, and green ones sometimes just because they are there, but I&#x27;d rather have just black.  I&#x27;d definately recommend this product because it&#x27;s the only side combs I&#x27;ll ever use since it holds my kinky thick hair back and my hair doesn&#x27;t get snagged or ripped out with this product.  You&#x27;ll never have that problem, happy shopping!!</li>
    <li> I cut my hair and needed something to keep the curls up.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I stick it in and it feels like it&#x27;s in there firm and then as the day or the event progresses, it just wiggle out....still working on it.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted for my hair.</li>
    <li> THE TEETH ARE A LITTLE SHARP, BUT THEY HELD IN OK FOR THE AFTERNOON WITHOUT NEEDING REPOSITIONING.  CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE LITTLE PIECES OF PLASTIC ARE SO EXPENSIVE THESE DAYS. I&#x27;LL SPARE YOU THE REST OF MY VIEWS.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s plastic and small. Not what I thought it was. It seem like it would work well with thin hair not thick African hair like mine.</li>
    <li> I have thick natural hair and this combs are great. They hold my hair in place and helps me create cute updos.</li>
    <li> I like these combs. They hold my hair and it is fine.  They came in nice basic colors and seem to hold my hair well.</li>
    <li> I only recently started wearing my hair with combs again while my bangs grow out. The ones I had were too flexible. I am pretty sure they are Goodys and they bend out of shape very easily and then won&#x27;t hold my hair. I have the same problem with the twisted wire combs. Since I can&#x27;t find plastic combs in stores, I was a little leary of buying these sight unseen, but as a Prime Add-on item, I wasn&#x27;t finding anything cheaper. I am really pleased with them. They are made of hard plastic and don&#x27;t bend out of shape. They aren&#x27;t as sturdy as the combs I wore in the 70&#x27;s, but aren&#x27;t the cheapo generic plastic of the last combs I bought at Dollar General 10 years or more ago. I know they won&#x27;t last forever, but these should last me until my bangs are long again. Colors are Brown; Olive; Cream; Black; White and Navy. They have a matte finish.</li>
    <li> Love the tuck-n-combs. Haven&#x27;t hand any since I was a teenager. Loved the up-do styles I created with my roller set</li>
    <li> These combs are worth the money!  They are nice colors and thick to hold the hair in.  Thank you for a great transaction!</li>
    <li> not quite sturdy and hooks are short so not very effective when latching onto hair and holding it in place. would not reorder</li>
    <li> I just love Scruncii products plain and simple.  These combs keep my hair in place all day with no problem.  My hair is naturally long, thick, and fluffy (African American).  I love these combs.  The price is great too.</li>
    <li> But perhaps user error is blocking me from enjoying these as much as I should. I want a smooth bump of hair in front of the combs, and then the rest of the hair to be held back (say, from off of my face.) But instead, I get a weird curl of hair with little control, and the rest of the hair just sort of curls around the comb. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m doing it wrong but the internet isn&#x27;t teaching me how to do it better, either. Perhaps my hair (which is growing out) just isn&#x27;t long enough?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, these seem pretty sturdy, and they come in a nice assortment of colors. Wish me luck as my hair grows out, perhaps I&#x27;ll get the hang of a nice comb-application.</li>
    <li> These little things are great! I&#x27;ve recently become interested in styling my hair in a more retro-style occasionally...among them being Victory Rolls. The combs are the perfect size for my hair to catch everything in them, and they stay snugly nestled to my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought a pack to customize for easy stocking stuffers for the long-haired ladies in my family - pearls, rhinestones, embroidery floss on the top edge for decoration. Great texture of the combs to keep the decorations.</li>
    <li> Love these, hard to find this bigger size, wish I could fide the clear ones in this size, nice to have them shipped</li>
    <li> Not much to say about plastic combs.  Common, their just plastic combs, they work.</li>
    <li> I like the combs and they work well. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them all the time to say how well they work, but so far they hold my hair into place. I have very thick, heavy hair and these seem to do the job when placed correctly.</li>
    <li> These are the absolute BEST combs for staying in place. Not fancy, just plain good. How many products can you say that about nowadays??</li>
    <li> I love these combs.  I had been picking up cheap ones at the dollar store, but they always snap in half.  These are quite durable and hold really well.</li>
    <li> good and sturdy combs...</li>
    <li> This came exactly as I expected, and the price can&#x27;t be beat.  I use them to help my daughter&#x27;s headbands stay in her hair, because otherwise the headbands slip down onto her forehead.</li>
    <li> I ordered these to use to pin my hair up. I have very thin hair, yet the teeth in these combs bend and break easily.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have bought combs in years and these work great. They hold my hair nice and tight. I also liked the color variety in the package.</li>
    <li> The combs are ok.  I thought they were going to be longer.  The picture is a great indication of the size.  I ended up using the combs to attach flowers to them.  It worked perfectly for that and was the perfect size for my daughter.  The combs are sturdy.  I rated a 4 because of the size.</li>
    <li> A lot of combs fit good price. Not the best quality, but good to have if you have a tendency to lose these. Like hair ties. These are also kid of hard to find too, so I&#x27;m glad scunci has them.</li>
    <li> Nothing I would consider buying again. They break easily.</li>
    <li> This is the best buy as an add-on. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this product. Add this to your purchase now!</li>
    <li> I usually love this brand but these side combs are awful. I have thick, naturally curly, African American hair and I couldn&#x27;t even budge a comb one inch down into my hair because the tines are way too close together and the plastic is inflexible and hard. I could feel it tearing my hair and I didn&#x27;t even bother to push down anymore. I actually found a much better and cheaper brand in my local bss for just a $1. You get a lot for your money with these but what&#x27;s the point of that if they can&#x27;t be used. Maybe these work for people with thin or fine hair.</li>
    <li> These combs have a matte finish, which holds my thin, fine hair a lot better than shiny plastic combs usually do. They&#x27;re also not flimsy, which I thought they would be because of the price. I&#x27;m VERY happy with my purchase and highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> Okay. Fine for everyday.  A little hard for thick hair but works well enough with a little adjusting.</li>
    <li> They are a bit wide for my fine hair and tend to fall out after a bit, but they might work well for someone with thicker or curly hair.</li>
    <li> This item is OK. I have long hair and lots of it so it didn&#x27;t really hold my hair good, but overall they are good quality.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and have to use 3 of these to keep my hair up. My hair is about to my collar bone and if it was longer might be easier to keep up. I thought these were great the first time I tried but then my hair kept falling down so I had to keep adding more clips to keep my hair up. I will probably just end up purchasing a more expensive higher quality French twist comb for my thick hair. Oh also the prongs after a few uses are already bending and coming out of shape. Not a horrible comb but not that good either.</li>
    <li> These are the best combs I&#x27;ve ever used. My hair is thick and long - few combs will hold. These do the job beautifully. They also seem durable, made with a slightly flexible plastic so the teeth haven&#x27;t soon broken out. My only desire is to have more in more colors.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly what I expected and no different from what you see in stores.</li>
    <li> Side combs, yay!!! I use to wear Goody side combs, and I was disappointed when they quit selling them.  When I saw these, I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes!! I bought four packages and I really like them.  The colors are nice and the combs stay put!!! I think you will really like these combs. Thank you Scunci!!!!</li>
    <li> I love these! I also love Amazon!</li>
    <li> I use these often and like them very much.</li>
    <li> Not what I needed, but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re perfect for someone. These are very thick and heavy and not flexible.</li>
    <li> I love these!  They&#x27;re more flexible, thus more durable than ones I&#x27;ve had in the past, and I like the matte finish and colors as well!</li>
    <li> I needed something to hold back my bangs. These will not stay. I bend over and they fall right out.</li>
    <li> Great strength. Not as &amp;#34;bendable&amp;#34; as the &amp;#34;Goody&amp;#34; brand and that&#x27;s a BIG plus. Great assortment for a good price. Only CON: I wish the tortoise were transparent, but that&#x27;s a minor issue.</li>
    <li> Bought these for a co-worker (a woman in her 60s) who had been looking for these combs in stores. Wasn&#x27;t able to find them anywhere so I was pleasantly surprised to find them easily on amazon. Good quality, nice colour selection. Would repurchase them for her if necessary.</li>
    <li> These are not really all that great. They fall out very easily! There are much better brands. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> performed as advertised. stay nice and firm while worn. did however found the same package at walmart for about half the price.</li>
    <li> Great hold, very versatile.</li>
    <li> These are not very flexible. I have fairly fine hair and can barely push these through. Hopefully they will loosen up a little, if I even wear them enough to do so. I do love the variety of colors.</li>
    <li> I use this on my daughter when I get her dressed up for her dance classes.These little combs help to keep her hairs in place and she look neat and tight.Best for all kids and I use them too!</li>
    <li> These work better than another set I bought and they do hold my hair a little better.  I like the variety in color.  My hair is very fine and silver.</li>
    <li> I love these combs.  They provide great grip on my hair with no breakage.  I wear my hair natural and sometimes need combs for styling.  These are great.</li>
    <li> These are okay for the price. Does not hold my thick hair very well but probably will work better on thinner hair. They look nice though.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Read size description as they are accurate.  Sometimes the stores don&#x27;t stock every hair piece you might like.</li>
    <li> These are cheap combs and they work for what I bought them.  My hair is really heavy so I&#x27;ve already lost a few.  All my fault I guess, I tried to hold back way too much hair.  Not a good idea but it is, what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they work for someone out there.</li>
    <li> I thought these combs would be a little more sturdy, but they are in fact plastic. With that in mind, they are great and work for what they are made for. I was looking for something a little more heavy and these are pretty light, so I don&#x27;t love them but I do like them.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my hair.  I wear them almost everyday. They stay put where most fall out.</li>
    <li> Broke as soon as I used them. Could have gone to the corner store and got them but tried to save a trip. No good! Dont buy.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t write a lot about hair combs--they are fine, work as combs should.  Good price, came quickly--no problems with them.</li>
    <li> wonderful grip and color choices.  and the colors are actually&lt;br /&gt;beautiful shades.  Inexpensive and effective.  Bravo!  I would buy more.</li>
    <li> THESE COMBS WORK GREAT I WEART THEM WITH A HEADBAND SO IT DONT SLIP OUT I WOULD RECOMMAND IT TO ANY GIRL</li>
    <li> I loved the price and the idea of these little combs but my hair is too thick for them to hold into place. They work but mot so much for my hsir texture. I use them to do frohawks.</li>
    <li> I love these combs.  I only wish they were a little longer.  Very durable and easy to use.  Would not hesitate to buy these again.</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy hair. These combs don&#x27;t stay in my hair, they pop out. I don&#x27;t know if the problem is my too thick hair or the comb is not long enough. I&#x27;ll have to try another style/brand.</li>
    <li> These are just ok. They look and feel cheap. I will never understand why hair accessory companies insist on making multi packs of hair things with every single color, I can only use two of these colors since I&#x27;m not blonde and I wanted something that is close to my hair color. Will not be buying these again.</li>
    <li> These actually do what I bought them for. I&#x27;ve been rocking my fro all week now.  The front I bantu knocked and took it down but use the combs to make some sort of style. Very cute. My hair is pretty thick and the combs held my hair intact.. I like these as well as the variety of colors.</li>
    <li> I got these to do a comb craft and they were perfect for the job.  Great price and easy to use.  We were able to use cloth to personalize them and add color(s). My kids love them.</li>
    <li> the material is inflexible and i found they did not slide smoothly into my hair or across my scalp.  Did not hold my hair well either.  Actually, I hated them and gave them away.</li>
    <li> Looks durable.&lt;br /&gt;Shorter than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Holds my hair, okay.&lt;br /&gt;Love the variety of colors.&lt;br /&gt;I will surely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use hair combs all the time and I order them online because apparently Scunci has a contract with corner drugstores - being the only kind they carry. They are the worst combs I&#x27;ve ever tried to use. I have fine, thin hair and these combs catch and pull, not sliding in smoothly. The teeth are fat and close together, which might make you think they will hold well - and they do - but they look awful doing it. I can&#x27;t position them without messing up my hair in the process. Goody or Vidal Sasoon make better ones.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!! These combs are not well made, they are flimsy and break very easily. I have long, curly hair and every time I would remove one of these combs at least four or five of the teeth fell out!! I threw them away..didn&#x27;t even bother returning them!!</li>
    <li> Just what l was looking for and price was good too.</li>
    <li> There were so many combs in this pack and for the money (they are twice as much in the store), they were a really good buy.  Definitely would recommend buying.</li>
    <li> There are just what I wanted,</li>
    <li> The edges were not smooth, on the teeth of the combs. They can grip once in, but risk tearing the hair to get them in. Good if you are in a pinch, but it is worth it to pay more and get heavier, smoother plastic.</li>
    <li> I have owned a lot of hair accessories in my lifetime. And, I have used quite a few hair combs on my afro and twisted styles. These are by far the best I have gotten. They never snag, ever. They stay in place all day. I actually have started sleeping in them overnight so that my style is ready in the morning. It is so convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick 4b/4c hair almost armpit length (APL) so I am always looking for a good way to tuck it back for protective styling. I wear these combs almost daily. I am wearing two now! I have had them for about a month. None of them have broken and the quality has not degraded even though I am sleeping in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price point is stellar. If you go to Target or some other retailer, they will cost at least $1 more. So, I recommend buying them here.</li>
    <li> These combs were exactly what I was looking for and the price was much lower than I had found in retail outlets. I purchased them for a craft project and they worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re combs. Not much special about them. Well made.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman with a lot of hair; long, thick, and stubborn. I&#x27;m always looking for new tools for my hair, and I&#x27;ve found my new favorite. I purchased a wide range of combs like this; Goody, Vidal Sassoon, Parcelona. The others are very pretty, but their glossy surface makes them too slippery to STAY. I was doubtful of these Scunci combs; in comparison, they looked kinda cheap- but the plastic is very flexible, and to my pleasure, the matte finish gives it just enough friction to stay where they&#x27;re put. I hate having to adjust and re-adjust my hairstyle throughout the day, as my tools (accessories) slip out of place, or their hold weakens- but these combs really shine, when it comes down to doing what they&#x27;re made to do!</li>
    <li> These things are perfect.  You can do everything with them.  I live in these.</li>
    <li> Very weak - they will not hold much hair. I use them for my bangs only.</li>
    <li> This set of combs was as expected. The variety of colors is nice to have and they seem to be of moderate quality.</li>
    <li> COMBS ARE NOT AS GOOD QUALITY AS OTHERS I HAVE PURCHASED....COLOR, LENGTH AND FIT IS NOT AS SMOOTH AS IT COULD BE.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for afro hair!</li>
    <li> I really love these clips. They help any hairstyle and are pretty durable! I always try to have these handy!</li>
    <li> Again smaller than I anticipated.  Should have just picked them up at Walmart so I&#x27;d know what I was getting.</li>
    <li> Cheap plastic. Nice colors but cheaply made.  I expected a better product from Scunci. The combs  will not hold my thick hair in place. They will probably work on thinner hair.</li>
    <li> These kinds of combs are hard to find in the stores these days. It was good to know that they&#x27;re still around! Just what I was looking for to hold back wavy, thick, course shortish hair with a mind of its own.</li>
    <li> These are great little combs. Flexible so they don&#x27;t break on you and such a great variety of colors. I use them to put in my hair while it&#x27;s drying so to give it a volume boost.</li>
    <li> I like these alot. Very handy item to have around with longer hair. Good purchase and affordable over all. Thanks for a great item.</li>
    <li> Listen, these are just plastic hair combs, but I need them with my pony tail. The price is great and they work wonderfully.</li>
    <li> These work great for holding my bangs back.  I&#x27;m trying to let my bangs grow out, so either I pull them back or I cut them.</li>
    <li> Quality item that appears it will hold up well and not break like others I have used.</li>
