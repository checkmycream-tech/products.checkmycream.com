      <li>Good grinder.</li>
      <li>This is a good grinder.</li>
      <li>As soon as it falls through the grinding chamber, it&#x27;s good to go.</li>
      <li>It was a good consistency for pipes.</li>
      <li>I think it is a good Grinder.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product if your looking for a good grinder.</li>
      <li>Amazing grinder.</li>
      <li>Had it for one month before the grinder and the top seperated.</li>
      <li>Much better than the crank style.</li>
      <li>All in all, I am extremely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
      <li>Also, something that is notable is the fact that there&#x27;s a plastic ring that facilitates rotations.</li>
      <li>I have very much enjoyed using this product.</li>
      <li>Real Sharpstone great price</li>
      <li>I love this SharpStone Grinder.</li>
      <li>I feel saying it&#x27;s like most store bought</li>
      <li>I could not have asked for a better one.</li>
      <li>The magnet that holds it together is plenty strong as well.</li>
      <li>Sure beats using the plastic ones and shipping was quick.</li>
      <li>Neither are of the finest quality, but hey, they were free.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this first.</li>
      <li>the top set of teeth just came out of the top of the grinder completely.</li>
      <li>The textured exterior feels amazing, and the lasered logo is a classy touch.</li>
      <li>Hope this information was useful in your decision folks.</li>
      <li>it functions just right.</li>
      <li>Yes you should clean it before you use it for the first time to make sure you don&#x27;t have any left over metal shavings inside.</li>
      <li>Very smooth Ive been using this Grinder for about 3 months straight on the daily and still as smooth as when I first purchased it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall a good grinder, typical quality metal and rightly-sized screens.</li>
      <li>he could spin the top but the teeth wouldnt move only the &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34; around them would.</li>
      <li>I love the double screen</li>
      <li>/&gt;-A good grinder, Does the job well, nice sharp teeth that show no signs of dulling.&lt;br /&gt;-Comes with little hand tool&lt;br /&gt;-5 compartments</li>
      <li>It grinds my herbs quite well and it has nice, sharp teeth along with five layers.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize that tapping it together was not necessary to free the product.</li>
      <li>I like everything about it and the price is really reasonable.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I may be forced to some day, as everyone that has used it has loved it.</li>
      <li>The high quality screens allow for plenty of herb residue to fall through and separated by particle grade.  </li>
      <li>I just need to get a new one.</li>
      <li>It has a two tiered pollen catcher, so the pollen at the bottom is essentially 100% pure.</li>
      <li>so far nothing to seize rotation.</li>
      <li>However, I recently purchased a Pax that needs a finer grind to produce a thick, steady vapor; also to get the most out of your product.</li>
      <li>Unlike the Marley grinder, I do not have to turn this upside down and continue grinding to get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really having a hard time finding a comparable spice or herb to describe to you the consistency of the ground product, as this product does not break down like most herbs.</li>
      <li>~Looked~ well built, then the top half of the grinder piece came loose from the top cap rendering it useless.</li>
      <li>Now if I give it away, or even lose it, I do not have to pay an exuberant amount to replace it.</li>
      <li>Saying that this is an improvement over my brother&#x27;s old, generic Bob Marley grinder is an understatement.</li>

    <li> It grinds my herbs up well and collects alot of kief. I like everything about it and the price is really reasonable.</li>
    <li> I think it is a good Grinder. Very smooth Ive been using this Grinder for about 3 months straight on the daily and still as smooth as when I first purchased it. I have not complaints about it. the catcher works great and does a good job as well. I would recommend this product if your looking for a good grinder. Sure beats using the plastic ones and shipping was quick. No complaints</li>
    <li> I recently ordered this product and was hoping for the cali-crusher to come with it because in the pictures it looks like it is supposed to come with it but upon receiving this product I did not find a Cali-crusher in the box. Quite disappointed but still a quality grinder</li>
    <li> Much better than the crank style. I love the double screen and I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> As advertised, Arrived on time</li>
    <li> My product works well, but i think the small radius attributes to stuff getting caught on the interlocking rims of the pieces. It is a small amount, but not negligible.</li>
    <li> i wouldnt even give this product a star if i didnt have to in order to rate it, i bought it for a friend as a gift. they used it for maybe 3 days before it broke. the top set of teeth just came out of the top of the grinder completely. it was apparently in 2 pieces which then continuously kept coming apart making the entire thing useless. he could spin the top but the teeth wouldnt move only the &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34; around them would. very disappointed in the craftsmanship of the product</li>
    <li> Good grinder. Triple chamber is the way to go.</li>
    <li> i had a five piece grinder before. I just need to get a new one. I could not have asked for a better one. This thing is a keef factory. Grinded 14g and got at least 5g in keef.  UPDATE. AFTER 2 years it finally broke the glue holding the teeth in place gave out</li>
    <li> This is a good grinder. Yes you should clean it before you use it for the first time to make sure you don&#x27;t have any left over metal shavings inside. But, you should do that anyway.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this buy.</li>
    <li> Very happy. Real Sharpstone great price (:</li>
    <li> I love this SharpStone Grinder. It is an extremely well machined piece. Saying that this is an improvement over my brother&#x27;s old, generic Bob Marley grinder is an understatement. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, for $8, it did it&#x27;s job. It was a good consistency for pipes. However, I recently purchased a Pax that needs a finer grind to produce a thick, steady vapor; also to get the most out of your product. I&#x27;m really having a hard time finding a comparable spice or herb to describe to you the consistency of the ground product, as this product does not break down like most herbs. I feel saying it&#x27;s like most store bought ground herbs would be deceitful because leaves are flat, and these flowers are not. Unlike the Marley grinder, I do not have to turn this upside down and continue grinding to get my money&#x27;s worth. As soon as it falls through the grinding chamber, it&#x27;s good to go. I&#x27;ve had this for about over a month now and gunk build up is virtually nonexistent. There are specks here and there, but so far nothing to seize rotation. Also, something that is notable is the fact that there&#x27;s a plastic ring that facilitates rotations. The textured exterior feels amazing, and the lasered logo is a classy touch. I did however scratch mine up a bit already. I didn&#x27;t realize that tapping it together was not necessary to free the product. Old habits die hard huh?  This is a five piece, but I actually took the finer pollen screen out. Now it&#x27;s a four, and I have stored the other screen as a back up. As a bonus, you do get a pollen scraper and a storage bag. Neither are of the finest quality, but hey, they were free. The magnet that holds it together is plenty strong as well. I have held it by the lid and shook it before, of course without product, and it stayed put for a while with increasing force. All in all, I am extremely satisfied with this purchase. On both the product itself and with shipping. Crazy thing is that I was actually trying to save up to buy a $65, four piece grinder. I&#x27;m so glad I found this first. Now if I give it away, or even lose it, I do not have to pay an exuberant amount to replace it. I may be forced to some day, as everyone that has used it has loved it. I definitely recommend this to anyone looking to buy a grinder. Hope this information was useful in your decision folks. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for months and it&#x27;s great! It grinds my herbs quite well and it has nice, sharp teeth along with five layers. Great for herb users.</li>
    <li> Sharpstone makes the best grinders out there.  When I saw the 5-piece I knew I had to have it.  The high quality screens allow for plenty of herb residue to fall through and separated by particle grade.  Supper efficient and durable and for that reason would recommend to anyone and everyone.</li>
    <li> ~Looks~ awesome.  ~Looked~ well built, then the top half of the grinder piece came loose from the top cap rendering it useless.</li>
    <li> I got ripped off my order DID NOT come with pollen press</li>
    <li> Shipped on time and product exceeds expectations.  Great value and it functions just right.</li>
    <li> Works great, excellent grinder.</li>
    <li> Very poorly made product. Had it for one month before the grinder and the top seperated. Would not buy.</li>
    <li> Looks and works exactly as expected! Great grinder for accumulating some pollen.</li>
    <li> Amazing grinder. Had it for over a year before it got stolen and I plan on buying the same one soon.</li>
    <li> It grinds my herbs like a champ!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the grinder but I did not get my Cali crusher press</li>
    <li> Awesome grinder for people who like pollen. It has a two tiered pollen catcher, so the pollen at the bottom is essentially 100% pure. I have very much enjoyed using this product.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-A good grinder, Does the job well, nice sharp teeth that show no signs of dulling.&lt;br /&gt;-Comes with little hand tool&lt;br /&gt;-5 compartments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-2 inches wide. Please take the time to imagine how small that is&lt;br /&gt;-The compartments tend to loosen unless you tighten them hard. Not that its too difficult to loosen them again, but i wonder how much of that the threading will take&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good grinder, typical quality metal and rightly-sized screens. Just not big enough unless youre grinding things in minuscule proportions.</li>
    <li> This thing is perfection</li>
    <li> It was an alright grinder I got what I paid for so I can&#x27;t be mad.</li>
