      <li>Then the lid will fit perfect.</li>
      <li>Looks really good goon product</li>
      <li>Even when they come with soap, the markup is amazing.</li>
      <li>It does make a nice appearance in the bathroom though.</li>
      <li>the cover is nice touch as well.</li>
      <li>Nice bowl.</li>
      <li>Quality workmanship with nice finish.</li>
      <li>It is nice laquered wood.</li>
      <li>nice appearance.</li>
      <li>then I did, as it really seems a very good bargain for a quality wood box</li>
      <li>but now I am glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>This would make a better frisbee than a shaving bowl.</li>
      <li>That being said, the construction is fantastic!</li>
      <li>I have a good stainless steel shave bowl from Amazon that has high sides and is ideal for me.</li>
      <li>wipes clean and serves its purposes while retaining fairly nice aesthetics.</li>
      <li>find the natural &amp;#34;wood&amp;#34; look attractive.</li>
      <li>Just the right size and fits in my hand nicely.</li>
      <li>You can easily buck up and get over that however.</li>
      <li>It was a gift for my son, who uses a straight razor, and he is very pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>Eventually the laquer will wear off but for now its doing fine.</li>
      <li>Above all, it looks great.  </li>
      <li>but I think it would be better if it were a little taller so that you could work up a good lather and not get it over the top of the bowl.</li>
      <li>When I first put the soap in the lid got glued to the soap until I used up the top bit of the soap.</li>
      <li>Some reviewers commented on the fact that this won&#x27;t fit a full bar of shaving cream</li>
      <li>My package came quickly, about 4 days.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works, not cheaply made, solid, recommend for anyone that need to store their soap and isn&#x27;t OCD about perfect fit.</li>
      <li>Other than that, pretty good for the price</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen this exact bowl for upwards of $30.00.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty</li>
      <li>so whatever good lather you make winds up getting trapped in the gap between the soap and the bowl.</li>
      <li>Obviously it is just a wooden bowl, but it looks good, is functional, and of course could hold your favourite soap when traveling for instance, or even at home.</li>
      <li>If you use Williams Mug soap or soap of that size, it is quite large.</li>
      <li>This is a nice bowl to have, but I was hoping that it would be a little bit deeper.</li>
      <li>just a beginner straight razor shaver, and putting together my tools and</li>
      <li>For the price, I will not complain too much.</li>
      <li>It does the job, and holds a whole bar of my shaving soap.</li>
      <li>Standard shave soap pucks fit in the bowl and</li>
      <li>Very well made.</li>
      <li>I started wet shaving the old school way a year ago and after my ceramic bowl broke I decided to get something more durable.</li>
      <li>Most shave soaps &amp;#34;DOES NOT FIT&amp;#34; trick is you need to cut the soap up in smaller pieces and microwave them in 10 second bursts til melted.</li>
      <li>This bowl is small enough to fit into most medicine cabinets.  </li>
      <li>The lid is reasonably secure, but maybe when traveling and keeping soap in it, I would suggest a small piece of tape to be extra sure.</li>
      <li>I was hesitant at first of getting a wooden shave bowl</li>
      <li>I had to cut the soap cake in half for it to fit below the rim of the bowl.  </li>
      <li>I like the natural finish.</li>
      <li>I use it to lather my shaving cream (currently using Taylor of Old Bond Street) which is in cream form, not bar.  </li>
      <li>Most traditional soap puck will probably be too big or too thick for this bowl.</li>
      <li>When a see it in his bathroom filled with his very expensive shaving  soap, i feel pride and a bit of secret glee, for I am sure he assumes I spent a lot more on it</li>
      <li>My fault, for not researching carefully, but there are very few soaps made to fit this.</li>
      <li>I really like the quality of this little bowl.</li>
      <li>bowl is large enough for a 3 inch (round) bar of shaving soap, but currently using a smaller bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> Nice bowl. Should hold up well, and it&#x27;s wide enough for any of the soaps I have used.</li>
    <li> This is a nice bowl to have, but I was hoping that it would be a little bit deeper. My intentions were to use it to actually make my lather in as I now use a coffee mug, but I think it is too shallow for this use. The cake soap is also smaller in circumference so whatever good lather you make winds up getting trapped in the gap between the soap and the bowl. I think it will wind up serving and just a \\&quot;holding tank\\&quot; for my next cake of soap. It does make a nice appearance in the bathroom though.</li>
    <li> Too small for standard size soap without the lid popping up a bit. Other than that, pretty good for the price</li>
    <li> It does the job, and holds a whole bar of my shaving soap.</li>
    <li> very nice sized bowl with plenty of loading room for brush</li>
    <li> I got this to hold my block of shaving soap. The only downside with it though is it&#x27;s too larger around and not deep enough to hold a puck. When I first put the soap in the lid got glued to the soap until I used up the top bit of the soap. It&#x27;s not a problem, just aesthetics, but it also has too big of a circumference for for the Colonel Conk&#x27;s soap I keep in it and as a result the soap is off to the side.    Works, not cheaply made, solid, recommend for anyone that need to store their soap and isn&#x27;t OCD about perfect fit.</li>
    <li> I started wet shaving the old school way a year ago and after my ceramic bowl broke I decided to get something more durable. I was hesitant at first of getting a wooden shave bowl but now I am glad I bought it. Standard shave soap pucks fit in the bowl and the cover is nice touch as well.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my son, who uses a straight razor, and he is very pleased with it.  When a see it in his bathroom filled with his very expensive shaving  soap, i feel pride and a bit of secret glee, for I am sure he assumes I spent a lot more on it then I did, as it really seems a very good bargain for a quality wood box</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this wood bowl and it gets exposed to water all of the time. Looks great on a bathroom counter, holds the largest sized soaps. I have not had any problems with these bowls (have two in different colors) cracking or being hurt by contact with water as others have mentioned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this away to a thrift store.  It is so shallow it holds practically nothing.  I have a good stainless steel shave bowl from Amazon that has high sides and is ideal for me.</li>
    <li> This shave bowl is very nice looking but I think it would be better if it were a little taller so that you could work up a good lather and not get it over the top of the bowl.</li>
    <li> Looks really good goon product</li>
    <li> This works perfectly. It was too shallow and too wide for the soap I use but I just had to melt the soap and pour it in. It is nice laquered wood. Eventually the laquer will wear off but for now its doing fine. It works perfectly for what I need.</li>
    <li> I like the wood.  I like the natural finish. For the price, I will not complain too much. But it is too shallow for the soap I use.  I had to cut the soap cake in half for it to fit below the rim of the bowl.  My fault, for not researching carefully, but there are very few soaps made to fit this.</li>
    <li> My package came quickly, about 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this bowl to hold my soap and another clay-fired bowl to mix; soap, glycerin-soap and or cream in.&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;m done shaving the soap on the brush gets wiped into this bowl to be save for the next shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is large enough for a 3 inch (round) bar of shaving soap, but currently using a smaller bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just a beginner straight razor shaver, and putting together my tools and this is a great inexpensive addition.</li>
    <li> So, I know the dimensions are in the description, but man...I did not realize it would be so small! Most traditional soap puck will probably be too big or too thick for this bowl. At this point it&#x27;s just sitting in a basket in my bathroom closet while I try to figure out a use for it. It&#x27;s way too shallow to be used as a lathering bowl. If I figure something out, I&#x27;ll update this review. That being said, the construction is fantastic! It&#x27;s solid, it&#x27;s pretty, it&#x27;s just not functional.</li>
    <li> The bowl is too shallow and splashes too much. I am now just using a Corelle dessert bowl, which works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I bought these bowls to hold shaving soap.  They work great and look good in the bathroom too!  I hope that you continue to carry them.</li>
    <li> This would make a better frisbee than a shaving bowl. The one that arrived was already split and I&#x27;m assuming that storing soap or water left over from lather would just destroy the bowl. AVOID.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice bowl. I have the dark wood one as well. I got it for my Arko shave soap. Just the right size and fits in my hand nicely.</li>
    <li> Some reviewers commented on the fact that this won&#x27;t fit a full bar of shaving cream but I do not think that was ever the purpose of this bowl.  I use it to lather my shaving cream (currently using Taylor of Old Bond Street) which is in cream form, not bar.  Above all, it looks great.  Let&#x27;s not kid ourselves, if you are buying this its for the look above all else and it serves its purpose well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying various shave soaps for a while, from various retailers. I&#x27;ve seen this exact bowl for upwards of $30.00. Even when they come with soap, the markup is amazing. Great product, great price, great experience.</li>
    <li> Quality workmanship with nice finish. Inside dimensions are 3 1/4&amp;#34; dia. x 1&amp;#34; deep (includes 1/4&amp;#34; lid engagement when cover is in place).&lt;br /&gt;I find the natural &amp;#34;wood&amp;#34; look attractive.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Received on time.</li>
    <li> Excellent bowl for my shaving soap. The quality of mine has been very good and the wood finish is very attractive.</li>
    <li> I use this to lather up my shaving soap with a brush. Obviously it is just a wooden bowl, but it looks good, is functional, and of course could hold your favourite soap when traveling for instance, or even at home. The lid is reasonably secure, but maybe when traveling and keeping soap in it, I would suggest a small piece of tape to be extra sure. I use a Body Shop product from a tube, so squeeze a little in and then lather in the bowl.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my father for Christmas to keep his shaving soaps in. It works like a charm . Great gift</li>
    <li> Very well made. nice appearance.</li>
    <li> If you use Williams Mug soap or soap of that size, it is quite large. You can easily buck up and get over that however. or you could pay attention to the size of your soap when ordering it. wipes clean and serves its purposes while retaining fairly nice aesthetics. What else do ya need?</li>
    <li> Great bowl! I really like the quality of this little bowl. This bowl is small enough to fit into most medicine cabinets.  Most shave soaps &amp;#34;DOES NOT FIT&amp;#34; trick is you need to cut the soap up in smaller pieces and microwave them in 10 second bursts til melted. Then pour into bowl. THATS IT simple. Then the lid will fit perfect.</li>
