    <li> IN PUERTO RICO THEY USE MOSKA OIL BUT ITS GREEN, AND IN A COMPLETE DIFFERENT BOTTLE DESIGN PROLLY FROM A DIFFERENT COMPANY. AFTER USING DIFFERENT MOSKA OIL MY MOM SEEMS TO LIKE THIS ONE SO I THINK ITS A GOOD PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I loved the fact that I received it extremely sooner than expected. The product works great!! Already shared with friends..</li>
    <li> I dont necessarily dislike this product, but i sure as heck dont like it! although it made my hair grow, it made my hair GREASY, OILY and GROSS looking!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time but I received a totally different kind of moska oil, not the one displayed in the picture which is the one I actually wanted.</li>
    <li> This product will make the natural, tiny facial hairs grow--in a short time!  . I stopped using this oil after a few weeks.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to women.  If you find that your face itches and stings all over--especially around your mouth-- affter applying MOS-KA oil to your scalp, it is because it is stimulating hair growth on your face!  I am careful not to get the product on my skin and I always wash my hands after applying any hair products, but this seems to get into the blood stream.  Possibly it has monoxadil agents in it, the label doesn&#x27;t tell you.  Supposedly Moska oil is derived from Macademia nuts; but I think there is monoxadil and not macademia in this product!  This product is probably good for men who are not adverse to growing facial hairs!  I&#x27;m tossing this or I&#x27;ll give it to a man!</li>
    <li> Smells like baby oil.</li>
    <li> This oil is the best for growing my hair. .. it takes time but it works!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have not decided if I&#x27;ll be buying this oil again. I don&#x27;t like the smell of it and the consistency is too thin and oily.&lt;br /&gt;Mosca translate to fly in Spanish, is this the reason for the smell? No, is not obtained from flies of course but&lt;br /&gt;you never know.</li>
    <li> Great product...I notice new growth within 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used it much yet so not sure if it will work</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already sent in a review.  I loved this product.  I got it earlier than expected, which was great.  I&#x27;ll be ordering again at the end of this month.  This product is great, came with a green conditioner, which was a gift.  I was really surprised.    Thank you for such a superior product and speedy service.  Rose Foster  Las Vegas, NV</li>
    <li> Excellent hair product. Non greasy only need a little......</li>
    <li> My hair is growing so fast. I was totally bald. Dermatologist said my hair would never grow. Someone told me about their success with Mos-ka Oil. I will be a customer for life.</li>
    <li> My hair is growing because of it!</li>
    <li> This oil is great for my prepoo. It smells clean and fresh and isn&#x27;t very heavy at all. I would recommend it to anyone with thick hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about anyone else, although it grew hair bit by bit, my sister and I noticed how good it is for split ends. Very helpful.</li>
    <li> Helped my hair get stronger. Used it everyday after spraying my hair with water in order to seal the moisture.</li>
    <li> Lovely fragrance. Arrived ahead of schedule &amp; intact. I can&#x27;t &amp; wouldn&#x27;t use it due to the &amp;#34;artificial dye&amp;#34; in it which I&#x27;m quite sensitive to.</li>
