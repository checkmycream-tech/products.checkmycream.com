      <li>Stung like a bastard for most of it</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t really love it.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve made such great strides!</li>
      <li>I freaking love this product.</li>
      <li>But I had to wipe, rinse the rag, wipe again, rinse, rinse some more, soap, and rinse some more before I was confident it was all off.</li>
      <li>love it love it love it</li>
      <li>If you enjoy lathering yourself in slimy, stinging, hive and scab-inducing goop that smells like a septic tank someone sprayed with windex, this is the product for you!</li>
      <li>I used this onarmpit dear arm area and let me say, ladies MAKE SURE you wash this off with soap and water or your body wash.</li>
      <li>Some were pleased and some were displeased.</li>
      <li>Could not take more than 3 minutes and had to wash it off.</li>
      <li>I would personally give this as a gift to all my FAKE friends and tell them how awesome it works just so they could suffer like I did, perfect revenge gift :D</li>
      <li>Easy and nice to use., good smell and not mess.</li>
      <li>Just smooth skin :)</li>
      <li>Liked it from the moment I tried it first time.</li>
      <li>The pain lasted a day, but after that it was fine.</li>
      <li>the rest of the hair was out, I patted dry with my warm wash cloth, and I was good to go.</li>
      <li>Bikini area came out great, but there are some areas of stubble left on my legs.</li>
      <li>The hair is gone and my skin is smooth with no irritation</li>
      <li>My first use I&#x27;d say it was okay</li>
      <li>I watched reviews on this product and read up on it before purchase and was excited to see the results I heard people rave about.</li>
      <li>I bought this item originally on clearance at Target on clearance.</li>
      <li>I leave this on for the full 10 minutes and experience no burning whatsoever.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been 4 hours since I removed my arm hair using the Cool Gel, and still no irritation whatsoever.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s true</li>
      <li>It is cool, like aloe vera.</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;cooling\\&quot; sensation isn&#x27;t very noticeable but seems to neutralize the \\&quot;burning\\&quot; sensation most depilatories cause.</li>
      <li>But the cool gel concept intrigued me, so I decided to give this one a shot.  </li>
      <li>For a while I even shied away from Nair, but this new product has brought me back for good!</li>
      <li>Be sure to test more than one area and perhaps multiple times before use.</li>
      <li>Comon, this is hair REMOVAL gel, not BABY lotion, so it cannot smell like parfume and be very gentle!</li>
      <li>Some people are funny!</li>
      <li>I used this on my bikini area, the most sensitive part of the body, and no problem!</li>
      <li>First of all, the tube says \\&quot;Cool Scent.\\</li>
      <li>I used it for the second time today (4 days since last time) and since the hair was much shorter it worked wonderfully.</li>
      <li>&quot; Right under that, it says \\&quot;no</li>
      <li>I will never go back to the original Nair formula, this is definitely my new favorite!</li>
      <li>Plus it was delivered fast!</li>
      <li>And it does exactly what it claims - it cools.</li>
      <li>sorry others didn&#x27;t have a good experience with this, but I&#x27;m absolutely in love with the product and the price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product twice so far on more *sensitive* areas and have had no adverse reactions.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive, fair skin and natural blonde hair, with everyone including the dog suffering through rotten egg smell for 10 mins</li>
      <li>so maybe the new Nair cream as too, right?    </li>
      <li>Of course, I just shaved two days ago so there wasn&#x27;t much hair for it to stick to.</li>
      <li>But the formula is so gentle, that the extended time didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
      <li>Cool sensation is interesting, much nicer than the burning sensations of Nair past.</li>
      <li>I decided to give it a go and do the whole leg.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now, and it works very well for me.</li>
      <li>But I figured it was cheap enough for a trial run.</li>
      <li>After I was all done, my arms felt chilled and very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
      <li>When it was no longer available locally, I began to purchase multiples online.  </li>
      <li>it ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT REMOVE YOUR HAIR.</li>
      <li>I thought wiping it off with a hot  wet towel  and water would do fine</li>
      <li>I was able to get it dirt cheap (presumably because so many others were having bad experiences.</li>
      <li>Used Nair cool gel 12 hrs ago (this morning, it is now 9 PM) and I am still in pain, and covered in red swelling bumps all over my legs..</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t need cooling lotion or oil to soothe my aching skin because for the first time, my skin was nowhere near aching.</li>
      <li>I did not mind the smell as, since I paid attention in high school</li>
      <li>I was highly ticked off when I started wiping off</li>
      <li>gel is so amazingly cool and sensitive that a reapplication was possible, without pain or burning or anything!</li>
      <li>I had no previous experience with Nair, usually being a Veet kind of girl.  </li>
      <li>and now my skin is melted off and left with a nasttty burn thats healing right now.</li>
      <li>I saw that Nair was advertising new products, this one included.</li>
      <li>Like I said, I did it on a seriously sensitive area!)</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell at all like our old products!</li>
      <li>I left it on for the full 10 minutes (the upper safe limit) to deal with my thick hair, and it worked like a charm.</li>
      <li>I wash it off in the shower and all hair is removed, my skin amazingly soft.</li>
      <li>but nothing so far.</li>
      <li>Wow...</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t surprised.</li>
      <li>My skin is sensitive, it doesn&#x27;t irritate it, no pimples after.</li>
      <li>I used to shave my arms due to sheer laziness, so the hair was more coarse and thick.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nair has certainly come a LONG way from the old smelly days.</li>
      <li>I got this product because it was highly rated in Real Simple, but it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I was able to use a hair removal substance from Nair (or any other company) without getting a rash or irritating bumps.&lt;br /&gt;I started with a decent amount covering my arms.</li>
      <li>I wiped it off with a rough wash cloth that I rinsed under hot water.&lt;br /&gt;98</li>
      <li>The first time, the hair was about 1/4 inch long and it was not completely removed in areas where hair was coarser</li>
      <li>My daughter used this product and had an extreme adverse reaction of hives, rash and intense itching which moved to her throat.  </li>
      <li>The cooling sensation is a bit odd-feeling, but the smell is pretty mild, and it does its job well, with just a few patches left that came off easily enough with a little washcloth scrubbing.  </li>
      <li>Cool Gel isn&#x27;t runny, or too thick.</li>
      <li>The problem I had was that it did not work consistently over the applied area but more painfully it did cause a break in the skin about the size of a .  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> ATTENTION: STAY AWAY FROM THIS BRAND. Used Nair cool gel 12 hrs ago (this morning, it is now 9 PM) and I am still in pain, and covered in red swelling bumps all over my legs.. It ruined my day and probably my day tomorrow because I can&#x27;t walk and I don&#x27;t want anyone to see my legs. I don&#x27;t care about getting my money back I just want my legs to look normal again :(</li>
    <li> Nair has certainly come a LONG way from the old smelly days. For a while I even shied away from Nair, but this new product has brought me back for good! It still has an odor, but not nearly as strong as it used to. The fact that this product is a gel instead of the cream format that Nair usually uses makes application much easier. It feels good and tingles while it removes your hair. You may need to leave it on a little longer than the instructions say depending on the thickness of your hair, (my hair is very thick &amp; course) but it definitely works. If you&#x27;re debating on trying this product I say go for it!</li>
    <li> it simply melted my skin away that is!!!!!! i didnt order it off amazon i bought it at wal mart. but either way, dont get it. im not allergic to anything and yet i guess i had an allergic reaction to and and now my skin is melted off and left with a nasttty burn thats healing right now. do not buy it. i didnt even leave it on for the reccomended time. stick to their creams or any other form of hair removal you choose to do. just dont use this product.</li>
    <li> Just as the the title of my review says, it did not work. I smoothed it on thickly and left it on for a full ten minutes (I have very thick hair). When I wiped it off, only a few, sparse hairs came off with the gel. A complete waste of money! Also, this stuff STINKS. Badly. I know all depilatory creams smell, but this was overwhelming and awful; I had to aerate the bathroom for 3 hours afterwards, and the stench clung to my skin long after I&#x27;d showered to rinse all the gel off. It also irritated my skin and left red bubbles behind my knees. Of course, everyone reacts differently to different products, and this was just my experience. But, beware.</li>
    <li> I have just finished using this product and I am thoroughly impressed! The cooling sensation is phenomenal! I leave this on for the full 10 minutes and experience no burning whatsoever. I wash it off in the shower and all hair is removed, my skin amazingly soft. The scent is still the same IMO but has been drastically muted, if you will, smells less...harsh? It&#x27;s great. I will never go back to the original Nair formula, this is definitely my new favorite! Excellent product. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> Left it on for about 7 minutes. Stung like a bastard for most of it so I figure I should remove it. I did not mind the smell as, since I paid attention in high school, I know that many reactions emit gases which may or may not smell unpleasant.  The problem I had was that it did not work consistently over the applied area but more painfully it did cause a break in the skin about the size of a .  I think I&#x27;m just going to acknowledge reality and go back to shaving...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice so far on more *sensitive* areas and have had no adverse reactions. The first time, the hair was about 1/4 inch long and it was not completely removed in areas where hair was coarser so I just shaved the patches and had no irritation. I used it for the second time today (4 days since last time) and since the hair was much shorter it worked wonderfully. The hair is gone and my skin is smooth with no irritation so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is not a miracle but compared to other depilatories it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found so far. The \\&quot;cooling\\&quot; sensation isn&#x27;t very noticeable but seems to neutralize the \\&quot;burning\\&quot; sensation most depilatories cause. The odor is very low compared to other products but it does still have a small odor but it does not linger on your skin or in your bathroom like other products I&#x27;ve used before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think it&#x27;s great for what I&#x27;ve used it for since I&#x27;m too lazy/cheap to wax and I get bad razor burn from shaving. If you are looking to give depilatories another try, I&#x27;d recommend this one.</li>
    <li> I have used this product on my underarms and arm hair and it works great. However, if you do not let your hair grow out at least 1/4\\&quot; (the length you would if you were going for a wax) it ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT REMOVE YOUR HAIR. So, ladies...forget about trying to remove stubble. This simply WON&#x27;T WORK.</li>
    <li> I saw that Nair was advertising new products, this one included. We&#x27;ve made such great strides! they said. Doesn&#x27;t smell at all like our old products! Lies, all lies.  First of all, the tube says \\&quot;Cool Scent.\\&quot; Right under that, it says \\&quot;no odor.\\&quot; Hmmm. How can you have both? You can&#x27;t.  This stuff STINKS. It smells like a perm. Actually made my eyes water.   The plus side? It worked. And no adverse reaction. I left it on my legs and bikini area for 8 minutes. Bikini area came out great, but there are some areas of stubble left on my legs. Of course, I just shaved two days ago so there wasn&#x27;t much hair for it to stick to. And still, there&#x27;s not enough left that I feel the need to shave. Maybe I need to leave it on longer next time.   It was hard to remove. Instructions say to wipe off the hair, then rinse. But I had to wipe, rinse the rag, wipe again, rinse, rinse some more, soap, and rinse some more before I was confident it was all off. The bathroom still smells terrible, but I don&#x27;t, which is good.  I will use up the tube, but I won&#x27;t buy it again. It&#x27;s not worth the mess and smell.</li>
    <li> Liked it from the moment I tried it first time. Easy and nice to use., good smell and not mess.</li>
    <li> WARNING: Do not use!!!!   Review written by Brittany Parker (wifie)     I am going on vacation and we are not checking any luggage so I can&#x27;t bring a razer with me (seriously hate the air line regulations - ridiculous!) any ways, I was desperate to try something, tried waxing, and i can&#x27;t bare it, and so my last and final solution was Nair, I have not used it in a few years and I don&#x27;t really love it. I have never had problems with it before although I have heard horror stories. I figured it would be ok to try (I was desperate) and assumed that over the past few years technology has gotten better so maybe the new Nair cream as too, right?    I did 2 small test patches and nothing happened the first time, the hair was not even removed, the 2nd test, the hair removed and no side effects.     I decided to give it a go and do the whole leg. I only left it on for 6 minutes (this is what the directions say, 5-6 min) and I have broken out all over in hives!! We are leaving for our vacation tomorrow! I am really upset and now that I think about it seriously, what is in this stuff that makes it remove hair, what was I thinking? It has to be a chemical and why would we want to put a chemical on our skin, basically my skin is reacting to a chemical burn. BEWARE of the side effects and do not use this or any Nair product ever!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed. These products NEVER work, but my mom and I tried it and voila!!!! I have thicker hair than my mom so I had to leave it on longer and sometimes go over an area a few times because it would come off in patches, but it works!!! I cannot believe it at all!! The scent isn&#x27;t too too bad though it&#x27;s not a fresh clean scent... it still smells like a hair removal product. While I wish I didn&#x27;t have to continually go over an area, I will take this versus waxing or shaving which leaves visible hair behind!</li>
    <li> I watched reviews on this product and read up on it before purchase and was excited to see the results I heard people rave about. Some were pleased and some were displeased. My first use I&#x27;d say it was okay and the product worked but the smell is disgusting... I had heard the smell was gross but figured it wasnt that bad... No, it&#x27;s bad...even after you wash it off. Yuck. I used this onarmpit dear arm area and let me say, ladies MAKE SURE you wash this off with soap and water or your body wash. I thought wiping it off with a hot  wet towel  and water would do fine but my skin was extremely inflamed and irritated because of left over residue. My under arms still have scars and hurt from this, which was like over a month ago.  They claim it can rinse off in the shower, please... You have to take a rag to it with soap. I hate this stuff. I&#x27;d rather shave. Ladies go with Veet. Or an epilator. This product is a waste of time  - H. Magee (writing from boyfriends iPad)</li>
    <li> I got this product because it was highly rated in Real Simple, but it doesn&#x27;t work for me. It works a little bit on my bikini line, but not on my legs or face.</li>
    <li> The best hair removal lotion. My skin is sensitive, it doesn&#x27;t irritate it, no pimples after. I hope amazon won&#x27;t stop selling it. Love it love it!</li>
    <li> Some people are funny! Comon, this is hair REMOVAL gel, not BABY lotion, so it cannot smell like parfume and be very gentle! And of course its chemicals! I do not know any herb removing hair! You have to be careful with timing and, yes it irritates sensitive skin. But, hey, i have such a tough hair, this is the only thing that removes it and it gives a little of cooling effect, so I am willing to sacrifice a bit (talking about skin redness the day it used)... It makes its JOB,so i like it. And the smell is not SO bad!</li>
    <li> My daughter used this product and had an extreme adverse reaction of hives, rash and intense itching which moved to her throat.  She tested the product 24 hours prior to use and had no reaction to the product.  She then tried to use it on her lower calves and had a terrible reaction.  We had to use oral antihistamine and antihistamine cream to get the reaction under control.  Be sure to test more than one area and perhaps multiple times before use.</li>
    <li> I had no previous experience with Nair, usually being a Veet kind of girl.  But the cool gel concept intrigued me, so I decided to give this one a shot.  The cooling sensation is a bit odd-feeling, but the smell is pretty mild, and it does its job well, with just a few patches left that came off easily enough with a little washcloth scrubbing.  I&#x27;d buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair removal product that I have found.  When it was no longer available locally, I began to purchase multiples online.  I always keep an extra one in reserve.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.&lt;br /&gt;I have no dislikes at all I will always use this product.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to everyone I know</li>
    <li> If you enjoy lathering yourself in slimy, stinging, hive and scab-inducing goop that smells like a septic tank someone sprayed with windex, this is the product for you! It is guaranteed remove your hair!.... And your skin.... And maybe some tissue if you&#x27;re lucky!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy hair removing!&lt;br /&gt;Ps. We warned you.&lt;br /&gt;dun Dun DUN</li>
    <li> When I read all the negative reviews about this product, I was really daunted. But I figured it was cheap enough for a trial run. I have never been more happy with my decision.&lt;br /&gt;Nair Cool Gel isn&#x27;t runny, or too thick. The smell is not over-bearing. And it does exactly what it claims - it cools. This is the first time I was able to use a hair removal substance from Nair (or any other company) without getting a rash or irritating bumps.&lt;br /&gt;I started with a decent amount covering my arms. I used to shave my arms due to sheer laziness, so the hair was more coarse and thick.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true, I had to leave it on for 10 minutes, maybe even 2-3 minutes beyond that. But the formula is so gentle, that the extended time didn&#x27;t bother me. I didn&#x27;t feel my arms begin to tingle, or the need to scratch, or a burning sensation - nothing.&lt;br /&gt;After about 10 minutes I wiped it off with a rough wash cloth that I rinsed under hot water.&lt;br /&gt;98% of the hair came off without any problems!&lt;br /&gt;Okay yes, as it&#x27;s been mentioned in other reviews, I had maybe 2 patches of left over hair on each arm, plus a couple of random stragglers here and there. But here&#x27;s the thing - the hair that didn&#x27;t come out right away was the extra coarse and thick hair. I wasn&#x27;t surprised. Or bothered. I just waited a few minutes, and then reapplied to the areas that had remaining hair. The second application I wiped off after 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The gel is so amazingly cool and sensitive that a reapplication was possible, without pain or burning or anything! After I was all done, my arms felt chilled and very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Once the rest of the hair was out, I patted dry with my warm wash cloth, and I was good to go. Didn&#x27;t need cooling lotion or oil to soothe my aching skin because for the first time, my skin was nowhere near aching. It&#x27;s been 4 hours since I removed my arm hair using the Cool Gel, and still no irritation whatsoever. No bumps, no rash, no red marks. Just smooth skin :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry others didn&#x27;t have a good experience with this, but I&#x27;m absolutely in love with the product and the price. I&#x27;ve never been more satisfied with Nair! I&#x27;ll be ordering this on a regular basis now. I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else.rry others didn&#x27;t have a good experience with this, but I&#x27;m absolutely in love with the product and the price.

    <li> This product did not work for me. It did smell and burned.  Could not take more than 3 minutes and had to wash it off. Burnd my back red for almost 2 days than itched for 4 days after that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now, and it works very well for me. It smells nasty as all hell, but it doesn&#x27;t leave stubble and hairs don&#x27;t start growing in for a few days. It also hasn&#x27;t made my hair grow in thicker thus far.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER I was rolling around in grass the night before I used it once. I got painful, itchy bumps all over my arms, which scabbed and scarred. I still have a couple marks on my arms and that was half a year ago at least.&lt;br /&gt;I like this product for myself, but everyone has different reactions to these types of products. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this to others, but I will continue to buy it for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU BUY THIS DO NOT USE IT ON ANY IRRITATED SKIN. On cuts, it will burn off the scab and surrounding skin and scar badly. On slight irritation, like the irritation from the grass, it will cause an ugly rash. BE CAREFUL.</li>
    <li> Yes it still smells, but it is MUCH less stinky than the past. Cool sensation is interesting, much nicer than the burning sensations of Nair past. I left it on for the full 10 minutes (the upper safe limit) to deal with my thick hair, and it worked like a charm. Well, ok, there were a few straggler hairs, nothing bad. I used this on my bikini area, the most sensitive part of the body, and no problem! I was able to get it dirt cheap (presumably because so many others were having bad experiences. I feel bad for them, but also perplexed. Like I said, I did it on a seriously sensitive area!)</li>
    <li> Wow...either I have a low tolerance for bad smells or you people can handle the worst of smells! It smells like someone actually figured out how to bottle up the smell from a septic tank, mixed with a little bit of menthol and sell it, seriously if the chemicals in it didn&#x27;t take the hair off, the smell should, but for me it didn&#x27;t :( I have sensitive, fair skin and natural blonde hair, with everyone including the dog suffering through rotten egg smell for 10 mins I was highly ticked off when I started wiping off and I still had my hairy legs, it didn&#x27;t take any off :/ ended up using the razor and I&#x27;m not really sure if the whole house stinks or if it&#x27;s just my legs but the smell won&#x27;t go away (I hope I don&#x27;t smell like I took a crap on myself all day tomorrow even though I took a hot 45 min shower. On the positive side, if you love the smell of rank farts, the feel of slimy legs and having to shave afterwards then this is for you. I would personally give this as a gift to all my FAKE friends and tell them how awesome it works just so they could suffer like I did, perfect revenge gift :D</li>
    <li> love it love it love it</li>
    <li> I bought this item originally on clearance at Target on clearance. It works great. It&#x27;s simple to use. Just rub on an area, wash your hands and wait no more than ten minutes. I can feel the product working. It is cool, like aloe vera. You can feel a slight tingle where it&#x27;s working but nothing painful. The smell is tolerable. I didn&#x27;t have any adverse reactions to the product itself, although I used it on multiple parts of my body. I did use it on my back but just a warning. If you have back acne, I wouldn&#x27;t use it there. I did not notice I had blackheads on my back, but this product basically obliterated them in a painful way. There was bleeding after a few minutes and when I rinsed off the product I felt like I had a sunburn on my back. The pain lasted a day, but after that it was fine. I did check to see if there was any irritation but nothing so far. I saw a lot of complaints about the scent, but its tolerable. I figure if the product works without any major issues, a mildly unpleasant scent doesn&#x27;t make a difference. The shipping was awesome. I ordered Saturday and received the items Monday. Great value!</li>
    <li> This is the only Nair product I can use! I love it! Plus it was delivered fast!</li>
    <li> I freaking love this product. Cvs,walgreens and walmart discontinued it because it wasn&#x27;t selling. So here I am buying online!! Love it!</li>
