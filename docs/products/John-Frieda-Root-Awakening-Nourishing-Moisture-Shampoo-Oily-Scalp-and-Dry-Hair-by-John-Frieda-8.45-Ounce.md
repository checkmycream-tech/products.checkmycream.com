      <li>and it was full of tangles.  </li>
      <li>All the reviews said it is good for oily scalp and dry hair, but it doesn&#x27;t work for me .</li>
      <li>I have a very sensitive scalp and thus most shampoos cause my scalp to be oily.  </li>
      <li>It tingles and feels really fresh.</li>
      <li>I have a very sensitive nose to perfume smells, and this is nothing like that, nor strong smelling like that.</li>
      <li>I see another reviewer experienced the straw-like hair effect also, so I am not sure what that is all about.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo is extremely hard to find &amp; it works great with my oily scalp.  </li>
      <li>This smelled awesome, but felt a little more harsh than the normal shampoo.</li>
      <li>I have been using this for a couple years and it makes my hair soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Ordered for my daughter - product is exactly as described.</li>
      <li>It has a good scent, but for me it&#x27;s not so heavy</li>
      <li>My new favorite shampoo it does not dry out my hair and cleans my oily scalp well.</li>
      <li>My hair feels clean, but my scalp is still oily - no other issues so I don&#x27;t need medicated shampoos.</li>
      <li>I never was able to find a shampoo made for: dry hair, oily scalp-then I found this!</li>
      <li>From what I&#x27;ve read, she has over-active sebaceous secretions in her scalp which results in a very oily appearance at the crown.  </li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t say.  </li>
      <li>I have a very oily scalp, and for this reason I used to have hair loss.</li>
      <li>Thanks,  Sheila</li>
      <li>I have never had a shampoo turn my hair to straw before, and I often use very inexpensive shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I really like this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much when i bought this shampoo</li>
      <li>But does it really treat an oily scalp or is it just another shampoo?  </li>
      <li>My hair is color-treated on a regular basis, which makes it look more full, but can dry out the ends.  </li>
      <li>If you buy, use it only at home, or transfer the liquid into a new secure bottle when you travel.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t confuse these with the kind for dry hair which has a similar package.</li>
      <li>Good for daily use, hair feels fresh and roots are not weighed down or greasy by the next day.</li>

      <li>wow i really like this product for the reason that it TINGLES</li>
      <li>I have extremely fine hair with an extremely oily scalp.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many different shampoos and conditioners and they may work for a few days but nothing consistently.</li>
      <li>Soft &amp; Shiny, Thank you!</li>
      <li>It seemed to only do the straw thing the first time I used it.  </li>
      <li>So glad the item came a week earlier than expected!!</li>
      <li>My hair looks fuller, shinier, and stays incredibly soft.  </li>
      <li>My hair feels soft and shiny after using it.</li>
      <li>Worth every cent spent!</li>
      <li>Even with deep conditioning, my hair can get &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; when using other cleansing shampoos, but my scalp never gets clean if I don&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>I used this entire bottle of shampoo and a spray in conditioner on the ends of my hair as I normally do.</li>
      <li>and I live in Brazil, I only realized when I was in Brazil!</li>
      <li>First wash, the stinky oily scalp problem is long gone and NEVER came back.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find any shampoo otc that addressed this new condition due to menopause.</li>

    <li> Smells good and feels great on the scalp.  But does it really treat an oily scalp or is it just another shampoo?  My hair feels clean, but my scalp is still oily - no other issues so I don&#x27;t need medicated shampoos.</li>
    <li> I have never had a shampoo turn my hair to straw before, and I often use very inexpensive shampoo.  I have an oily scalp, with fine, fly-away hair.  After two uses, this shampoo made my hair feel like straw, and stripped away any shine that was in it.  I will not use it again, not even to finish the tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update- well, I was out of other shampoo and decided to give this another go.  It seemed to only do the straw thing the first time I used it.  Has not since.  I see another reviewer experienced the straw-like hair effect also, so I am not sure what that is all about.  Maybe it has something to do with the shampoo you used previously?  I really can&#x27;t say.  But my husband does like this shampoo, so I am buying it for him.  I still find that my scalp remains oily with it, and I need to use something on the ends for dryness.  So my review has gone from poor to mixed.</li>
    <li> My favourite hair conditioner. I have been using this for a couple years and it makes my hair soft and smooth. It also smells great.</li>
    <li> wow i really like this product for the reason that it TINGLES yeahhhh you just read that .mjm it tingles and feels good i also love the mint scent also it made my hair easier to style which is a bonus. iit definetly does what it says it awakens your scalp it made me feel good and refreshed</li>
    <li> Good for daily use, hair feels fresh and roots are not weighed down or greasy by the next day. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I received sample packets of this shampoo and conditioner and absolutely love this stuff.  First the smell is wonderful, very fresh not overpowering.  The shampoo suds up nicely and really had a clean feel.  My hair felt smooth when I rinsed the conditioner.  A quick blow dry and my hair feels great and in control without any fly-a-ways.  Soft &amp; Shiny, Thank you! Placing my order now for more!</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive scalp and thus most shampoos cause my scalp to be oily.  This one irritated my scalp so bad that the oil returned in four hours.  It caused so much trouble I had to go to my dermatologist for another prescription to get rid of the side effects.  Very harsh shampoo.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo and corresponding conditioner because my hair tends be extra oily especially about 20 hours after cleansing. It will look dirty like I have not washed it in days. I have tried many different shampoos and conditioners and they may work for a few days but nothing consistently. I have tried different salon tricks and still nothing. This product has worked the best and I have been using it about a year. I still have to wash my hair once a day but at least my hair looks clean for at least 24 hours! It is hard to find so I buy it on amazon...</li>
    <li> I bought this Shampoo to take care of my scalp acne,after reading the description..but it made my problem worse:-( I am using the T-Sal right now,which seems good so far...hopefully.</li>
    <li> I bought  shampoo for oily hair, but I received only for dry hair. As I was on vacation and I live in Brazil, I only realized when I was in Brazil!</li>
    <li> My favourite shampoo. It&#x27;s great for people who have oily scalp but dry hair. It gets your hair through the day - and it&#x27;s still perfect at the end.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shampoo for people like myself with an oilier scalp.  It keeps my scalp clean without drying out the rest of my hair, and it smells great.  I like the hint of peppermint.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it.. use this brand over 5 years.</li>
    <li> I never was able to find a shampoo made for: dry hair, oily scalp-then I found this! I wondered if I&#x27;d notice it help my oily scalp which contained a small portion of oily dandruff. Once I washed, it lathered GREAT. And, I felt it actually sinking into my scalp going after the oily dandruff! I can&#x27;t explain. It wasn&#x27;t like a stinging or tingling dandruff shampoo. And the smell.......It&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s not very scented, but the scent it is, is great. I have a very sensitive nose to perfume smells, and this is nothing like that, nor strong smelling like that.</li>
    <li> Perfect for oily scalp and dry hair! Since I found this a year or two ago, I can&#x27;t stop using it. I try other shampoos sometimes when I&#x27;m traveling and they always leave my oily, this is perfect for my scalp. I recommend it if you are looking for something for this combination!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why some people said it turned their hair to straw- do you not use conditioner afterward? I use conditioner and my hair is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, solved my hair needs perfectly!</li>
    <li> this shampoo works wonders for those of us who tend to have an oily scalp - all of John Frieda&#x27;s products are amazing!</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. It helps with my oily scalp. I love the price as well. I couldn&#x27;t find any shampoo otc that addressed this new condition due to menopause. Finally some help.</li>
    <li> I have extremely fine hair with an extremely oily scalp.  My hair is color-treated on a regular basis, which makes it look more full, but can dry out the ends.  Even with deep conditioning, my hair can get &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; when using other cleansing shampoos, but my scalp never gets clean if I don&#x27;t.  This shampoo is amazing.  My hair looks fuller, shinier, and stays incredibly soft.  My ends don&#x27;t split as badly, and my stylist says she&#x27;s never seen my hair so healthy.  I do use the matching conditioner in the ends, and it moisturizes without leaving oily residue.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. I love it. I received the product on time.      Thanks,  Sheila</li>
    <li> Not only does it do a great job of cleaning my oily fine hair, but it also smells wonderful.  The scent is a combination of mint and eucalyptus, very refreshing and clean.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and amazon has the best price!</li>
    <li> Root awakening nourishing moisture shampoo for extremely dry hair by john frieda is very good.It awake my hair root and nourish my dry hair</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. It tingles and feels really fresh. My hair feels soft and shiny after using it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Worth every cent spent!</li>
    <li> Smells like any other tea tree oil product. Has that same effect on my scalp with the tingling. I have oily scalp and dry hair. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my oily scalp than I do with my regular moisturizing shampoo for dry hair. I used this entire bottle of shampoo and a spray in conditioner on the ends of my hair as I normally do. No difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 of these explode in my suitcase now, leaving shampoo everywhere.  If you buy, use it only at home, or transfer the liquid into a new secure bottle when you travel.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo we&#x27;ve found that works for my daughter.  Everything else leaves her hair too dry or it simply doesn&#x27;t penetrate to the scalp.  This is not dandruff shampoo.  It is for oily scalps with dry hair.  It reduces the oil buildup without further drying the hair.  She does not have a dry flaky dandruff condition which unfortunately is the dominant shampoo treatment available and lead to a misdiagnosis of my daughters condition.  Everyone thought it must be dandruff because that&#x27;s the only treatment on the shelf.  Dandruff shampoos seemed to make it worse including the expensive dandruff products. From what I&#x27;ve read, she has over-active sebaceous secretions in her scalp which results in a very oily appearance at the crown.  That is opposite of a dry dandruff scalp.  I can no longer find this shampoo in local stores so I hope it is not being phased out.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is extremely hard to find &amp; it works great with my oily scalp.  So glad the item came a week earlier than expected!!</li>
    <li> My husband gave me a sample size of this shampoo in my Christmas stocking.  At first I thought I&#x27;d found the perfect shampoo, I have an oily scalp and dry hair and it&#x27;s hard to find shampoo that works.  I gave it a try today and I loved the smell and it lathered and rinsed well.  Then after I towel-dried it I went to comb it out and it was full of tangles.  I have never had that problem before.  I blow-dried it and it became a flyaway, staticky mess.  My hair feels like straw now!  :(  I&#x27;m heading out now to buy some good deep conditioner, which I hope will fix it!  NOT happy.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo- cleans my oily scalp without drying out my hair</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much when i bought this shampoo but ,oh boy, it works wonder. My scalp is no longer oily at the end of the day. I hate it when my hair is oily and i&#x27;m loving this product so much now. Will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It keeps my roots from getting oily while hydrating my ends. My scalp is healthier than ever.</li>
    <li> It came for dry hair.... Not the product i&#x27; ve ordered... Dry hair &amp; oil scalp</li>
    <li> This product is terrible.  Makes hair frizzy and tangled.  Used once or twice and threw it away.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Finally a shampoo for those of us with oily scalps!This shampoo does wonders! It is the only shampoo that lathered up on the first application! It leave my scalp with a good tingling sensation and a wonderful scent!  My long hair also brushes out and braids very nicely!</li>
    <li> All the reviews said it is good for oily scalp and dry hair, but it doesn&#x27;t work for me .</li>
    <li> My new favorite shampoo it does not dry out my hair and cleans my oily scalp well. I don&#x27;t however like the conditioner it does not seem to condition my hair well at all.</li>
    <li> Before found this product, I had stubborn stinky yet oil scalp on my crown area causes frustrations and feeling very yucky everyday due to the thick oil gelling up my hair.  Tried every shampoo and even home remedy (apple cider with lemon juice to soak my crown of my scalp before washing each time) and even tried using baby powder to avoid having stinky smell on my scalp after half day from just washing my hair.  It kind of helped but the oily and smelly sensation did not go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, found this magical shampoo, which was on sale in Safeway, tried it and LOVED it!!!  First wash, the stinky oily scalp problem is long gone and NEVER came back.  I could not find the shampoo from Safeway as they ran out, so Amazon is my next lifesaver (and they are cheaper than sale from Safeway). Thank you to whoever created this shampoo.  I strongly recomend to anyone who suddenly have super oily scalp problem due to hormone change.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> This made my daughter head itchy.  Ended up throwing it away.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is a really good option for oily scalp. I have a very oily scalp, and for this reason I used to have hair loss. Since I&#x27;m using this shampoo and its conditioner, my hair stopped falling and the scalp is much less oily. But it only works if I wash my hair everyday and if I only use conditioner at the end of the hair. It has a good scent, but for me it&#x27;s not so heavy and that&#x27;s a problem. Don&#x27;t confuse these with the kind for dry hair which has a similar package.</li>
    <li> The only conditioner my daughter can use. Her scalp is extremely oily, but the rest of her hair is not &amp; this product helps to keep the oil down withot drying her hair out.</li>
    <li> This smelled awesome, but felt a little more harsh than the normal shampoo. However, it did the job...but I will probably buy the non-oily hair shampoo in the future.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my daughter - product is exactly as described. Prevents oily scalp without drying hair out. Would definitely purchase again</li>
