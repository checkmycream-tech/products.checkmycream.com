    <li> Better than any other ones that I have now</li>
    <li> I love this color on my skin during the summer. I am hispanic and during the texas summer, my skin is a bit darker- the contrast of the dark skin with the mauvish color gives my toes a very nice look. As with other OPI colors, this color last  a good while.</li>
    <li> Great color. Just as expected.</li>
    <li> Good Producut and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This is a great spring color!  I&#x27;ve worn it on both my toe nails and finger nails.  Recommend two coats.</li>
    <li> the pigment is perfect. paint as many coats as you want. This is definitely a quality product. I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I love this color-lucky lucky lavender! It&#x27;s a good formula, very smooth, opaque in one coat. Kind of a light purpley pink.Love OPI!</li>
    <li> This is like a regular lavender, well what I think is lavender, its not the same color as the picture to me at all, I looked up swatches online though first anyways so I bought it knowing what I was getting. It&#x27;s much lighter and in some lighting looks like a light pinky purple, but that&#x27;s what I wanted so I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I love the color, and when I finished my first bottle I bought a replacement on Amazon. But while the bottle I bought in a drugstore covered well and didn&#x27;t chip easily, the bottle from Amazon is thin, runny and chips almost immediately.</li>
    <li> I ordered this polish after having tried it at the nail salon and getting compliments on the color.  My order arrived quickly and just love the color.  I continue to get so many compliments about how pretty the color is on my nails.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Not a usual color and a nice change to the pastel palette. OPI quality.</li>
    <li> Was not what I expected. It isnt even really purple its pink. Looks nothing like the picture.</li>
    <li> different from all the pinks and corals of summer.  A great neutral with a pop of color.  But it does tend to chip more easily because it does have a &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; tinge to it.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous, creamy, soft lavender polish that reads either pink or purple depending on what you&#x27;re wearing.  I like it for both manicures and pedicures.  Perfect spring/summer color that lasts without fading out like some other lighter shades.</li>
    <li> Hi,I got items,Thank you</li>
    <li> I ordered this after reading another good review about it. I love this color! 2 coats and you get the perfect color. I have been wearing it all spring.</li>
    <li> Lucky Lavender by OPI is a great neutral color. Once I tried this nail color I stopped buying multiple bottles of nail polish.  I use this color all spring and summer.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this violet color, I recommend it to any woman who loves all shades purple and pink. This is the perfect color in the middle of the two :-)</li>
    <li> This is my favorite color and all ways get compliments when wearing it. Very nice color for spring or for me all year around.</li>
    <li> Very nice color and received just as expected. Opi makes good polishes. Love this for spring and summer. Buy now!</li>

    <li> Great polish.  Goes on smoothly and lasts on your nails.  I recommend it.  Love the color,.</li>
