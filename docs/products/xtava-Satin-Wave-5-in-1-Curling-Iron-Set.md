<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have really thick hair, so I need a hot iron to get a good curl. This does get hot enough and curls really beautifully. I like having so many options for curling, so it&#x27;s a great value. I like the thermal bag because I can pack up the hot irons quickly if I need to take it on the go. It has a long cord, so it&#x27;s easy to maneuver around in front of the mirror. The only complaint I have is that there are no protective tips on the end of the attachments, so you do need to use gloves if you feel compelled to hold the tip of the wand. Overall, I love this curling iron for it&#x27;s compactness, the travel thermal bag, and the different sizes of attachments so you can really create a lot of looks.</li>
    <li> Really like this item yet it gets VERY hot and no settings to lower, only on and off, so have burnt myself many times. Attachments work well yet are a little tricky to lock/unlock. If end stayed cool and could adjust heat, would give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> very versatile, just wished  I can control temperature</li>
    <li> I was SOOOO excited to get this curling iron. I bought myself a new one around two years ago, but made the mistake of choosing a barrel size that was much too small for my long hair... so instead I&#x27;ve just been continuing to use my 15 year old curling iron that doesn&#x27;t get hot enough any more. Let me just say that this XTAVA curling iron makes a fabulous first impression. It comes in a very pretty box (would make a great gift), and also comes with a heat insulated carrying bag so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it melting your other items while it cools if you are traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attaching the different barrels is very simple, and while I think I&#x27;ll probably use the larges barrel size the most frequently, I tested them all for this review. I&#x27;m happy to report that they all work great! I have naturally wavy and generally &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34; hair, and I had great success with all five of the barrels without using any hair spray or product. The two curling wands without clips are great for that &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; look, and leave your hair with less defined curls. The barrels with the clips have enough size variance to really only ever need this one product plugged in. I find the larger barrels are best for my long hair, while the smaller ones are nice for shorter hair or if you&#x27;re going for Shirley Temple type ringlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback that I can find (as many other reviewers have pointed out) is that there is no touchable tip at the end to help control the iron. If you are used to grabbing the tip to hold it or help control where your curls fall, you&#x27;ll definitely need a heat glove. Although I read the reviews that stated this prior to trying mine out, I still burned my thumb, index and middle fingers on my first curl (old habits die hard, I guess). I&#x27;m assuming that with come practice with this new iron I&#x27;ll grow out of that habit, or I&#x27;ll just bust out my heat glove for extra protection. Use caution... the iron is hot!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical. I received this and immediately tried the curling wand.  It worked very well, even without product in my hair! Pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> These curling iron Rods  do not have a tip. I had to buy a glove for protection as I am use to a plastic tip</li>
    <li> I love it, where can you get 5 in 1 curling iron that price.</li>
    <li> We are never buying another brand of iron. I love this set and my daughter&#x27;s hair is super straight and long. We have spent years, tears, money, and time on curls to just fall flat....until now! Wow! All sizes work great, but we love the wands on her hair and irons on my long layers. Curls last through competitive cheer days!!! Also-- super customer service! Can&#x27;t brag enough!!</li>
    <li> oh this is one of the coolest hair products i have purchased! so glad I did...</li>
    <li> This product shipped right away and was just want the picture shows. It comes in a very nice heat protective carry case and I love having 5 different options and yet they don&#x27;t take up a lot of room. They heat up and cool down rather quickly.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I have tried one of the barrels and one of the wands easy enough to change out</li>
    <li> This is a great curling iron set. It was so hard to find a curling iron that would curl my hair the way i wanted it and this does it in a breeze. Best curling iron ive owned!</li>
    <li> The 5-in-1 Curling iron is pretty neat to have since you can have all your curling need in one place. They are ceramic barrels. It has a very nice heat resistant travel bag as well.&lt;br /&gt;There are 5 wands that click into one base.&lt;br /&gt;3 barrels with clips, a small, medium and large for loose to beach curls. These have the clips to hold your hair while curling for the traditional way of curling your hair&lt;br /&gt;2 clip-less wands, these are for tighter curls&lt;br /&gt;The clips hold on to your hair for dear life. Your hair will not slide out of these clips.&lt;br /&gt;The barrels/wands slide into the base and then you can turn the lock to ensure the selected barrel is in place. You can be sure the barrel will not fall off or slide off. Before changing or removing any of the wands or barrels be sure the wand is off and completely cooled. It can take a little work to remove the wands after unlocking the lock. Just give it a wiggle at the same time you are pulling the wand off.&lt;br /&gt;There is an automatic shut off which is an excellent feature. You won&#x27;t have to worry if you have left it on and can relax cause of the automatic shut off feature. The one main thing I wish was different was the ability to change the heat setting. There is only an on/off switch. It heats up to 410 degrees and only takes about 2 minutes to get up to max heat. It does however have a very long cord which swivels at the end, so no tangled cords. It leaves a long lasting curl with a great shine.&lt;br /&gt;Here are the different curls each wand can do for you. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and unbiased opinions.</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to try the Xtava 5-in-1 Curling Iron. What&#x27;s included?  The base unit, 3 clip curling irons and 2 curing wands along with the storage  bag and instruction booklet. First to test was the largest of the clip barrels.  You insert the barrel into the base unit and click over to the right to lock it in.  The arrow did not fully align under the lock sign, but felt secure. You know how you hold the end of a clip curling iron when you are curling to help adjust over the hair and adjust the tension?  Well, I found out the hard way that these irons DO NOT have a cool tip.  I burned my middle and index fingers pretty badly. What&#x27;s missing from this set - a heat protecting glove!  Thankfully I have a few and slipped this on right away after the unfortunate incident.  I still don&#x27;t get how you can curl your hair WITHOUT touching the tip of the barrel.  Can someone advise? Overall, this is a great set at an affordable price option.  Be aware that this does not come with a heat protecting glove, that which you will need to safely use this tool.</li>
    <li> ** Update:  Xtava has since upgraded this product to include one glove (For using with the wands). LOVE this curling iron!  I was going to upload pics, but I&#x27;m having issues with doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The addition of the heating glove is a HUGE improvement. It allows you to grab the curling iron and hold it in place. The curling iron doesn&#x27;t have a plastic piece on the end like most curling irons do, so the glove is essential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, the different sizes that you get are perfect for any look you could possibly be going for!  From wavy to tight spiral type curls, this curling iron is going to give you limitless options to choose from!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that I was most excited about with this set was the curling &amp;#34;wand&amp;#34;, I&#x27;ve never tried a wand before and so I was able to have two different sizes which was fab.  I was shocked at how quickly my hair curled when using the wand and how tight the curls were.  It also is able to get so much ore of your hair that most normal curling irons can.  I was able to get curl up to an inch of my scalp, and most curling irons just don&#x27;t curl that far up. ( at least that&#x27;s been my experience).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s super easy to use, you just pop whichever extension your wanting to use and then slide the dial on the handle to the lock position (I kept trying to turn the extension itself, until i realized the locking mechanism was on the actual handle).  It heats up within about three minutes!  The one thing I wish that this set had included was a wand glove to help from preventing burning yourself when using the wand (most wands come with a glove).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this uses ceramic technology which is known to be a great source of heat for your hair.  The 8 ft long cord means that you can easily style your hair wherever you need to, or help someone else style their hair comfortably and without having to stretch to make it reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter loves it and she and her friends have already used it quite a few times, the only trouble I&#x27;ve had is getting it away from her long enough to use it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Received product for review purposes.  However, the thoughts and opinions expressed here are my own.way from her long enough to use it myself.  ** Received product for review purposes.  However, the thoughts and opinions expressed here are my own.</li>
    <li> First this iron is CLOSE to awesome but falls short.  The attachments clip in very easily.  It looks nice, but it burned my hand.  Not only does it not have a coot tip to grab at the end but the base itself got hot and was difficult to handle.  It is a little difficult to manipulate with one hand which means I got weird crease lines in my hair.  This would be no big deal if it had a cool tip on the end so I could use two hands to control the angle but it doesn&#x27;t.  The stand is loose and flops over against the iron getting hot and giving you yet another spot to burn yourself on.  I simply could not use this without burning my fingers so I returned it.  With a few modifications this would be a very good iron.  I hope they fix it.</li>
    <li> Only issue I have is that there is no cool touch spot on the top of the iron and I like to hold the end of my iron while twisting the clap end with my other hand.  you can only use one hand while using this iron or buy one of the gloves to use with it.  I might be getting one of those gloves soon since this iron did not come with one.  Gets very hot and I love the different sized wands.</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast. The product was nicely packaged. Within the box, I recieved a 50% off next purchase coupon. In my opinion, the curlers and wands heat up pretty quickly...within 2 mnts ( I&#x27;ve had curlers that&#x27;ll take longer) The get very hot so a heat protecter spray/oil and heat resistant glove is highly suggested. My only con is that they&#x27;re quite hard to pull away from the attachment &amp; it seems like it takes them forever to cool off once shut off. Overall the product is good, curls are beautiful, &amp; i would recommend them.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS!!! Seriously, this is such a cool little hair tool. But it&#x27;s not really little is it?? It is a FIVE in 1!!! This is the PERFECT tool to take traveling. I always debate on taking 2 different size curling irons when I travel because I use a larger barrel iron to curl my bangs then the rest of my hair. But guess what?? NO MORE!! Now I can take both sizes PLUS some!! and it all fits in one HEAT PROOF bag!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-FIVE barrels in ONE! sizes for all shape curls and hair length sizes are  1.25&amp;#34; 1&amp;#34; .75&amp;#34; and 2 tapering wands : .7&amp;#34;/1&amp;#34; (Tapers) .3&amp;#34;/.75&amp;#34; (Tapers)&lt;br /&gt;- long long cord (8 ft!!!)&lt;br /&gt;- swivel cord!!!&lt;br /&gt;- heat proof travel bag&lt;br /&gt;-Ceramic tourmaline barrels&lt;br /&gt;- shut off function .. I always turning my car around to check to see if I truly turned off my iron&lt;br /&gt;- gets insanely HOT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- no cool tip touch.. I am so used to touching the tip so I got a little ouch the first time I used it :( I simply forgot so be careful!!!&lt;br /&gt;- no heat glove included for the cone shaped barrel&lt;br /&gt;- no heat control. it is one temperature&lt;br /&gt;- wait time to switch barrels.. it is SO hot to touch so I felt uncomfortable trying to switch barrels&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, the pros outweigh the cons and I would definitely get this again. I would gift these as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my pictures I used the cone shaped taper wand for all my hair except my bangs where I used the biggest barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it!</li>
    <li> Love it!!! works well. but should be very careful. It&#x27;s hot hot hot. I&#x27;d better buy gloves.</li>
    <li> Love.. Love .. This is an awesome product, gives you flawless curls!</li>
    <li> I have been using this a short time, but so far no complaints on this. It come with 5 adaptable pieces that lock in place. Keep in mind once one is on you will have to wait for the whole system to cool down before you can keep using it. It has a nice large regular curler. A medium size curler attachment. A smaller one to do tight curls. I would suggest this one for close to the face if you want a tight curl. The 4th barrel you get is with out and gripping on to the hair. You would have to hand wrap your hair around. Do able but be careful with those little fingers. The final head is for times when you want a very tight spiral curl. Remember there is no guards to protect you from burning your self. It heats up nicely and fast. This is made ceramic tourmaline which helps with making your hair shiny and curly. This technology helps with frizzy hair and drying out your hair. This does have a nice automatic feature if you forget it at home or just sit it down and walk away. After so long it will shut it&#x27;s self off. It comes in a nice case to keep everything nice and tidy. I will say the 360 degree cord is awesome. No more getting your self tangled up just to look good. Now with this it is free to work with you as you are moving getting ready. As an active blogger i received this item for little or no cost. all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> Great set, everything came with it, nothing was left out! Using it now, by the way, it gets extremely hot. I would highly recommend using the glove with the wand, I have 3 burn marks where I didn&#x27;t use the glove, very hot! Love the product!</li>
    <li> Mine doesn&#x27;t shut off - not good after leaving it while I went to work.  Really hot after 9 hours!</li>
    <li> curls are amazing even a lot of curl left when I woke up the next morning but it didn&#x27;t have cool tips on iron which I burnt  myself several times then I finally got a glove that I had from a previous iron and used solved that problem but I felt it got to hot on the thumb catch and release for me and I didn&#x27;t like that there was only 1 temperature setting and since I color my hair I want to put it on lowest setting possible but yet with great curls so if this would have a cool tip and multiple temperature settings and thumb rest would not get hot then it would be Perfect if in the future they will do this I definitely would repurchase but as of the way they are not I had to send back but my hair is coarse thick and some wave and curl and this iron made beautiful curls!</li>
    <li> I cant get it to hook together. .need help</li>
    <li> There is no way to hold on to this curling iron, there is no cool tip.  I burned my hand severely when trying to curl my hair.</li>
    <li> Just tested this out to play around. I wish I knew years ago that I needed a wand to curl my hair. I have very curl resistant hair I can never get the desired results. I&#x27;ve been using a flat iron but it&#x27;s destroying my hair. I am in love with the 2 wands this comes with they&#x27;re awesome. I won&#x27;t be using the 3 irons they just don&#x27;t work for me or I would have given 5 stars. These heat up fast but take forever to cool down. Great buy overall&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update. I took the clamps off the curling irons and use those as wands now too.</li>
    <li> WOW. I got it fast. And it looks great. I have not used it yet but did plug it in and it gets hot fast.&lt;br /&gt;Thank-you.</li>
    <li> I have recently purchased an Xtava 5 in 1 set. I was cautious at first to purchase because I have never heard of brand name. I took the risk and went ahead and ordered a set. The product was timely to arrive. I ordered on a Tuesday and received it that Friday. I practiced using my product on my little sisters hair, mainly because of it was a bad product I would rather her hair get burnt than mine since it grows faster. Her hair looked wonderful! I first started with the curling irons and the made beautiful curls. The wands worked wonders as well. The curls were bouncy and not frizzy and did not burn the hair or scortch. She went to sleep and woke up with the curls still intact. I later used the product on my own hair and it turned out better than hers! I would say yes to anyone who is questioning buying this product. Great curls, heats up quickly, and is a great brand.</li>
    <li> When I first received my package, I barely looked at it and didn&#x27;t used a barrel until I had somewhere to go. I have used this curling iron twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair type: I have long fine straight/wavy hair, longest strands is close to touching my waist line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I used one of the clipless barrels, the smallest one which I found difficult to use considering how hot the iron gets and how inexperienced I am with a clipless barrel. I burned some areas on my hand and finger. However, after about 10 minutes of curling my hair, I did love the results. I had curls that lasted me for a few days before I washed my hair. The second time I used it I was using the clip barrel, which was one of the bigger ones. I realized that I am not a huge fan about the no cool touch tip. Even though I am experienced with clip barrels I found it difficult with the no cool touch tip. The second time I had good results and burned myself only once. I would like to note I only keep my hair on the barrel for a 3-8 seconds as this iron is really hot and can make a curl fast. I think it could have been better with a cool touch tip to help make the process of curling easier. My curls again lasted for as long as I let it, usually 2-3 days. So far I have not tried the other barrels and I have kept it the way I bought it. I think it looks more organized keeping the barrels in the plastics it came in and keeping it in the heat protectant bag that comes with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It was on SALE when I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;  Comes with 5 barrels.&lt;br /&gt;  -3 clips (with kick stand to set on counter area) and 2 no clips (1 tapered -big to small tip, 1 straight)&lt;br /&gt;  Swivel is handy for no wire tangles while doing your hair.&lt;br /&gt;  Heats up FAST.&lt;br /&gt;  Heat protectant bag (I usually wait to cool off my barrel before I put it in here, just to be on the safe side)&lt;br /&gt;  Once it is off, cools fairly quick.&lt;br /&gt;  Fairly easy to switch barrels&lt;br /&gt;  Has a LOCK feature for the barrels&lt;br /&gt;Has a feature that if it is left will turn off on its own (I never tested it, but handy to know)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: No cool touch tip&lt;br /&gt;  No heat resistant gloves (It would be handy for clipless)&lt;br /&gt;  One setting for heat (my other curling iron has multiple settings for how hot I want it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this again? Yes, because for the price I bought it and the 5 barrels, I think this is definitely worth the money especially for those who are new to curling hair. I only suggest you buy a heat protectant spray for your hair because it gets really hot and wear heat resistant gloves (I need to buy one if I plan to use this more, so I don&#x27;t burn myself when I try to curl my ends).</li>
    <li> Hi&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to get my 5 in 1. However when I opened it, it was the wrong product. It was a flat iron. ;(((((((&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how this happened! I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
    <li> Nice concept, but doesnt do well on African American hair. The temperature  gage isnt adjustable  so you dont get enough heat to effectively style thick african american hair. However, I really like all the attachments and the case. I just wish I could benefit from such a unique product.</li>
    <li> Great product very reliable shipping! It actually came a little earlier than expected. Packaged very nicely!! Curled my hair effortlessly!! No regrets about buying this product at all.</li>
    <li> Great set! Curls really hold and I&#x27;ve always had trouble getting a curl to take. Heats up quickly and you don&#x27;t have to hold long for curl to form. Love having the different options for size.</li>
    <li> i had Been shopping around for a curling wand, I really wanted to try one out. When I saw this you just couldn&#x27;t beat it. It&#x27;s like buying 1 curling iron and getting 4 free at this price! I like to use all the sizes at once - I think it makes my curls like more natural because they aren&#x27;t all the same size. Heats up quickly. Comes with a heat glove and a carrying case that fits everything inside. Excited to take it to the beach next month and not have to pack several different irons!</li>
    <li> Does not have auto shut off</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this and I was not disappointed. I have thick ang long hair that goes down to almost my butt and it works well. It heats up and my hair stays curled for about 2 days.</li>
    <li> The best item I&#x27;ve ever bought!! I love it!! Best buy anywhere. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I am so happy with the curler! I love all the wands and stuff. It&#x27;s so easy to use, wands are my favourite. Now I can finally get the looks I always wanted and it&#x27;s so fast! I love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. The barrels get super hot and does not take long at all to curl my hair. My hair is straight and down the middle of my back. The barrels stay locked in place when using. I definitely recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> Great curling irons. I only wish that the ones with the clips had the know at the end so you could grip it. Other than that no complaints here. They get very hot as well which is great for my thick hair.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron. It easily switches the attachments on and off. It heats up quickly, and curls perfectly. I have had tons of curling irons in my life, one for every size, shape and this bets them all. It has everything you need all wrapped into one package. I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product!</li>
    <li> Only negative for me is speed of the heat. It takes a while to get hot</li>
    <li> I like this curling iron was different due to the 5 ways to style. Happy a glove was included for fact there are no cool tips attached. I had hard time curling my hair for the reason too hot to grip tips. I need someone to style my hair..i just cannot do it alone with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they are 410 degrees too high so use protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this was provide for review</li>
    <li> love it!! Beyond what I was expecting. Quality, versatility and all in a carrying case!!</li>
    <li> I am not a beautician but I LOVE this curling iron.  At 67 years old I have gone through numerious (to say the least) curling irons. You tend to buy with each new style and hair cut you another curling iron or product.  With this XTAVA curling system you will never need to do that gain. I have medium length hair and I can have it straight one day, in a bob the next, then curly.  You can have so many styles, that you will never be bored with your hair again.  I spend less time doing my hair and yet it looks better than it ever has.  I will never buy another curling iron again. I perfer tocall this a Curling system.</li>
    <li> VERY NICE! Comes with a nice bag that fits them all in it then the box is very nice and sturdy for protection. It was the first time I used these different types, I have VERY long hair and I got all my hair rapped around the iron. Most curling irons cant hold all my hair and I normally have to curl the bottom then the top but not with these especially the long narrow one....AND I love how fast it curls...... be careful though and take advantage of the glove that comes with it ( even though it was not advertised! was a nice extra!) the curl was sooooo hot after wards you need the glove on to hold it in place till it cools.... I know this set is worth a pretty penny! You will get more than your moneys worth with this one..... VERY NICE I love it!</li>
    <li> Had to return. Couldn&#x27;t get base stuck out of the &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; position when trying to change the curl inserts. Don&#x27;t waste your time. All curlers are approx the same diameter anyways.</li>
    <li> Love the fact that the ends are interchangeable.  Mine also came with a heat resistant glove to help ease of use.  Did not take long for curl to take and it left them shiny and held for hours.  Absolutely recommend! Now if they would sell extra barrels as add ons!</li>
    <li> High quality and amazing packaging! Shipping was fast! Thank you!</li>
    <li> THis 5-in-1 Curling Iron is awesome.  I have owned several different curling irons before, but never a 5-in-1.  I love that I only have to own one curling iron instead of wasting space with several different sizes of curling irons.  As soon as I got my packaged I had to open and try it out.  I was super impressed that this came with a storage back and a heat glove as well!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any problems attaching the iron I wanted to use.  The iron heated up really quickly. I can definitely see this one being used in a salon.&lt;br /&gt;I love that the cord is a swivel cord and can go up to  360 degrees.  That makes it easier to reach and curl my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I did not have to leave the curling iron on my hair for very long in order to get it to curl.  I left it for about 20-30 seconds.  You get curls that look fantastic.  I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about this curling iron at all.  I love that now I can have options on how I am going to curl my hair!  Such an awesome product.  I was provided a sample for free to test and review.</li>
    <li> Because of the excellent customer service I recently received, I changed my review from 4 to 5 stars.  Last month, my curling iron began to have problems heating.  With no issues at all, they shipped me a new set to replace my defective one.  I&#x27;m very impressed with the company.  Thank you Xtava!  I really like this curling iron set and the flexibility of the different wands.  However, the clamps on the 1 in and 1.25 inch wands are slightly loose and my hair falls out when I try to curl.  Otherwise, I love it.</li>
    <li> Love how I am able to change the heads of the iron to customize my curls. The product comes in a heat resistant bag and fits all the tools comfortable and it comes with a heat resistant glove as well. I was disappointed that there was only a on/off button and no way to adjust temperature. I felt like it was a little bit too hot for my hair and burnt it a little. I also felt that the tip should have a base to hold but these do not. As I got these from a huge sale, about $30, I think it was a great purchase for the price. But I would not recommend these at their original price.</li>
    <li> Love everything about this from the thermal bag to the different barrel. Great curls!</li>
    <li> I love love LOVE  thiiis curling iron</li>
    <li> I am so in love with this iron set!...it&#x27;s perfect for every need!...some days I curl it with the larger wand and it loosens up but still looks amazing and sometimes even better two days later!...it does get super hot so be careful...there&#x27;s no temperature gauge...the barrels are like butter though so no burnt ends or sticking!(even with product)...I would&#x27;ve glad paid more for this set...the price was unbelievable for what you get!...I&#x27;m a hairdresser and it&#x27;s super easy to switch out the different attachments for all my clients...just use the glove they give you!...I&#x27;ll be buying extra sets for sure to retail in the salon.. ..even the box and b packaging is beautiful. ...LOVE!</li>
    <li> I love my new curling iron. It heats up quick, and gives me the option to curl my hair any way I like, thanks to the different hair curling options.</li>
    <li> Works great, love my new curls :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this many times on myself and my daughter, and we love it. The curls stay in for my full work day and now it&#x27;s easier then having five separate curling irons. Also, it&#x27;s easy when traveling.</li>
    <li> I have reviewed a lot of Xtava&#x27;s line, and got a lot of their items free but this is super fun! I love the options as I change my hair style. Thanks Xtava you offer some solid products!</li>
    <li> This is a really easy to use 5 in 1 curling iron . switching barrels is really easy and you get so many different barrels that you can choose just about any curl you want. I love that it heats up in 2 mins and comes with a handy carry case for storage and travel&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron. You can&#x27;t beat the price. Considering you get 5 different sizes. And it comes with the travel bag which is a bonus. Just a tip I use a winter fleece glove to keep from burning my hands when I use it and. To change the heads. It works wonderful.</li>
    <li> I received this  product by accident instead of the flat iron plates.  I have to admit after deciding to keep it and trying it out, I was glad I did. The variety of wands that the curling iron offers is great because certain curls I would have never tried.  I have very thick hair and normally shy away from curling irons or curls in general because they do not keep.  But this iron got hot enough to put some curl in my hair and the different wands allowed me to see what curls work best for my hair.  I liked the auto shut off and also how they wands all lock into place nicely.  Overall very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> The days of having a hair tool for every hairstyle are gone. No need to have three different barrel curling irons cluttering your bathroom vanity. Xtava has solved the problem offering a new 5 in 1 Curling Iron with interchangeable barrels. You can go from beachy waves to tight curls without digging out another curling iron from under the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only are you enjoying five different curling irons in one device, you’re getting all the healthy hair benefits of using ceramic tourmaline technology.  Moisture is sealed into your hair to prevent frizz by the negative ions emitted from your curling iron barrel to counteract the positive ions often found in dry, damaged hair. Your hair will look healthier and shinier all day because of the tourmaline barrel. Enjoy the freedom to move with the 360 degree 8 foot swivel cord - no more tangled cords! Plus, it’s travel friendly meaning that it has a universal dual voltage plug for any outlet and a heat resistant bag perfect for packing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Versatility is key in a hair styling tool, but a safety feature that’s perfect for women of any age, especially teens, is a shut-off function. How many times have you came back after your busy day only to find out you left your curling iron on? It’s scary because you could accidentally get burned, start a fire, or injure any pets or children that may be in the area unattended. Rushing out doesn’t have to leave your wondering hours later if you remembered to turn your curling iron off because it’ll turn itself off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minimize your hair styling tools by purchasing this 5 in 1 Curling Iron from Xtava.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was purchased with a promotional or discount code.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness,  I almost didn&#x27;t try this because I have very long hair that is so straight I have never been able to get it to curl.  Normally,  I curl it and 30 minutes later,  you can&#x27;t tell that I&#x27;ve done anything to it.  lol.  I gave up and just grew my hair long so it would be out of my eyes,  but I always thought,  it would be nice to have some soft waves sometimes.  I always thought it was just a pipe dream until I received this one.  It curled my hair quickly and the curl has been holding most of the day.  Even when it relaxes,  I still have curl.&lt;br /&gt;  This curling iron has 3 different sizes with the clip on type and 2 sizes without.  The ceramic tourmaline makes all the difference.  My hair looks healthier and shinier after I use it,  than before.  Don&#x27;t make the mistake I did and not use the included heat resistant glove.  haha.  I have a few burns to prove my hard-headedness.  The heat goes all the way to the ends,  so beware.  After using it a few times,  I have gotten the hang of it and don&#x27;t need it as much.  It also comes in it&#x27;s own bag that is lined with silver.  That makes it so much easier to see which styler you are looking for.  I really love this company and that the products are created by women.  After all, we are the ones who use them.  They also donate a portion of their sales to charities for women.  I would love their products anyway,  but I feel much better knowing that they are socially responsible.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed by this curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product free for the purpose of testing and review , and I am so happy that I was given that opportunity to share how much I love it.</li>
    <li> The 5 in 1 CURLING IRON from Xtava is pretty cool.  It has 5 different interchangeable ceramic curling iron barrels that click into the handle.  The handle has a lock feature so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the barrel coming out while your using it.  This curling iron set comes with 3 of the clip style barrels and 2 of the clipless wand style barrels.  The sizes range from .3 - .74 of the the narrowest want style barrel to the 1.25\\&quot; of the clip curling iron.  These give you so many options.  I can create corkscrew curls, waves, big curls for body and bounce, ringlets, and even straighten my hair.  While I love the diversity this set gives me, I am surprised by a couple things.  1) There is only 1 heat setting - on.  Most curling irons have a multiple heat settings or a least a range of low, medium and high.  2)  None of the barrels have a cool touch tip.  I&#x27;ve been using curling tools for any years.  A cool touch tip nowadays is pretty standard.  If it does not have one then it comes with a heat(silicon) glove.  This does not come with a glove either.  Fortunately I have a spare kitchen one I can use.  I do love the long 8&#x27; cord and 360 swivel cord.  A lot of twirling goes on when curling hair so it&#x27;s nice to not have the cord get all tangled up during the process.  This iron also has an auto shutoff feature.  This iron gets hot and will give you lasting shiny curls quickly thanks to the ceramic tourmaline technology.  I like that it comes with a  eat resistant bag for safe storage and carrying.  I do have to not there was small tear in the outside covering of my bag.  Just cosmetic though and along a seam.  Nothing that affects the usefulness of the bag.  I received this item in exchange for my honest opinion in a review.</li>
    <li> Ive used the wand to curl my hair extensions and it curls so perfect, I love it, Haven&#x27;t used any of the other ones but I know I wont be disappointed with the rest of them.I would purchase again for myself, friends and family.LOVED THIS!Disclaimer:(Ive only used the wand twice).-Zarah</li>
    <li> There is a screw missed on one of the parts.</li>
    <li> This would have been a five stars if two things were to happen: a temperature setting button AND a tip at the end of the curling iron so I can hold it and not burn myself!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I wanted but still holds the curls</li>
    <li> This set works great for me. I love being able to switch between the different barrels. The set comes with 3 irons (1.25\\&quot;, 1\\&quot;, 0.75\\&quot;) and two wands (1\\&quot;-.07\\&quot; and 0.75\\&quot;-0.3\\&quot;) Other reviews have mentioned that it&#x27;s difficult to disconnect the barrels, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues. I just grip the base and right where the barrel connects (by the locking feature). It&#x27;s much easier that trying to pull the ceramic part of the barrel. It heats up quickly and heats up to 410 degrees. I do wish there were different temperature settings, but in all honestly, I&#x27;m super inpatient and always put it on high anyways. The iron is ready to go in about a minute and I can curl my hair with the large wand in about 5 minutes. I have super fine and baby thin hair... so it goes really quickly. I only have to hold the wand up for maybe 3 seconds each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set does not come with a heat protectant glove, which I would really suggest getting. I have some from previous curling wands, so it&#x27;s not a big deal to me. There is no cool-touch area on the top of the irons like you&#x27;d normally find, so it&#x27;s easy to burn yourself. I also use the glove with the wands because I like the wrap the ends around tightly. That way it&#x27;s curled through to the end. The heat resistant case it&#x27;s a huge plus, because I hate leaving my iron out on the counter. This way I can throw it back into the bag while it&#x27;s still cooling. It&#x27;s also great for traveling - even if you only bing one barrel, it&#x27;s still nice that you can pull them apart to save space. All in all, it&#x27;s a great product that works for me, but if you don&#x27;t like to use your irons on a high setting, this isn&#x27;t the product for you. It goes to 410 degrees and it gets up there QUICKLY.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.  Gave it as a gift to my tween and she couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> First of all I have to mention the packaging.I have never seen a product so well packed.It was in a pouch/bag and then placed in a hard box.The pack contains curling iron with 5 ceramic barrel and one hand gloves.It has dual voltage and operates at 100/220 volts AC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to use just attach the barrel and twist it to lock it.It takes less than 1 minute to get fully heated.There is no way of saying how hot the iron gets but it&#x27;s hot enough to provide perfect curl in 10 seconds.With 5 different sizes barrels I was able to create every sizes of curls possibly known to mankind.My hair are waist length and have wavy texture.It hardly took me 20 minutes to curl it.The iron slide easily through hair leaving perfectly curl every time plus ceramic added additional shine to hair.I wanted to try how long the curl will last without using any kind of hair product and I was amazed to see it lasted for the whole day.Have auto shut feature so if it&#x27;s left untouched for 30 minutes it will get automatic shut off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:- There is no cool tip so make sure to wear gloves on your left hand otherwise you are going to burn it.Although it&#x27;s get proper amount of hot but a temperature control would have been nice.Bag does hold everything but it&#x27;s a tight fit.I have to adjust it every time otherwise the bag won&#x27;t get fit into hard box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am loving my curly hair and the fact that it&#x27;s so fast and easy to curl it.I got this product for free as a part of promotional sample in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I would give this a 5, but I found out the hard way about a safety hazard I hadn&#x27;t expected. I&#x27;m used to curling irons where the tip is safe to touch. Not so with this one. You have to &amp;#34;one-hand&amp;#34; curl your hair. I love the idea of interchangeable barrels, but I really wish the end had heat protection so you can use 2 hands.</li>
    <li> OMG! I never knew that my hair could look so good! Honestly, as a person with fine hair, curling my hair can be difficult. Not because there is so much hair, but because my hair simply falls flat most of the time. These curling wands are the best thing to happen to me.&lt;br /&gt;Not going to lie... it took some getting used to. I have always used curling irons, so the wand was something new. But a few tutorial videos, and I am shocked and amazed! If you struggle to make a curl last all day, then you need these! The temperature is blazing hot, but it makes my hair curl and it does not fall flat. I want all of your products now!</li>
    <li> Great great great!!! I love it so easy and powerful!</li>
    <li> Xtava has a great line of awesome hair products. I absolutely love this curling iron because it has every attachment I can possibly need. It comes all packed in the cute little bag that is foil lined so it wont harm the outside of the bag if the curling iron isn&#x27;t 100% cool yet. That is a great feature and most curling irons don&#x27;t come with their own bag. This iron has many features I love. First off it has a great 360 swivel cord to it so it doesn&#x27;t get tangled when you are turning it to curl. The cord is extremely long which is great especially when you are trying to do someone else&#x27;s hair you can easily walk around a chair to curl someone&#x27;s hair. The barrels are easy to attach pop them in and turn the lock piece and it stays securely and is easy to change. Each barrel is nice because than I can have one iron with many barrel attachments without having to have multiple curling irons of different sizes. It is easy to operate and makes my hair look amazing. I was so happy I received this as a gift to share my experiences with it.</li>
    <li> I did not receive the item posted. I had my heart set on the 5-in-1 curling iron and I received the straightener. I ended up keeping the straightener and it&#x27;s ok, but not great. I really wish I would have gotten what I had paid for.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love! They work on my hair amazingly and my curls stayed in after a long night! I did the at 2 pm danced , sweat, and slept in them and they still look good in the morning just had to re-curl a few bits! But Highly recommend you buy a glove because it does get super hot!</li>
    <li> The XTAVA Professional 5 in 1 Curling Iron is my all time favorite Now, Thank You XTAVA for an awesome All in one set! With the choices of curling styles, auto shut off, 360 degree swivel &amp; 8ft cord this curling Iron set is the Bomb! I am so happy to get to try this out for an honest unbiased opinion. I ablsolutely Love it! I tried the curling iron on my fine straight hair &amp; My hair is Very hard to curl and normally have to leave the curling iron in it for way too long to see any result but not with this.&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to try this as it came, took it out put in one of the attachments &amp; turned it on, It heats up very quickly &amp; curled my hair quickly too.&lt;br /&gt;Each attachment give you different size &amp; type of curls. I am very very impressed with this curling iron. The set comes in a nice zippered bag which I think is very cool &amp; that way you won&#x27;t lose or look for the attchment as they are bagged up together!</li>
    <li> Works fine, just having a hard time not touching the end of it!  Ouch!  No cool tip!  It does come with a heat resistant glove, which I wasn&#x27;t aware was included, so I had ordered one and had to return it.  I do wish I had just ordered a regular curling iron like I&#x27;m used to.  Most of the sizes will never be used so keep that in mind when ordering.</li>
    <li> Received my item. It has a few problems with it. Although the curling advantage is awesome, they hold for super long and I love the barrel options there were some obvious flaws. The barrel didn&#x27;t click completely into place and was often difficult to turn once placed in. The auto shut off feature doesn&#x27;t work so I have had to return this item. Unfortunately they wait for them to receive it before sending me a new one which means I am now stuck waiting over a week for my replacement to be returned. bummer</li>
    <li> Love this all attachments work great so happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> This was not my first wand purchase but it was my first time buying a set. Out of all the wands i have owned and used this set/brand is by far the best. I love the variety of barrel sizes. I read a review that said they didn&#x27;t like that theirs didn&#x27;t come with a glove, but mine did. I also loved the packaging of the wand and the bag to store it in. Overall i am very satisfied with this purchase. I will update later down the road after using it more!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to curl my hair as soon as I got this in the mail! I unboxed and  immediately went into the bathroom. I absolutely love my set! I feel like my hair looks so much healthier after using it. It makes my hair so soft. Usually my hair doesn&#x27;t hold a curl for more than a few hours, but with the xtava silk edition, I can go days and still rock the same curl, and that&#x27;s without hair spray! I have wavy hair that&#x27;s damaged easily and it was always such a hassle to do my hair. I have tried curling mt hair before and thought i was just bad at it, but really it was all about the curling iron i was using. With the xtava, it seriously takes less than twenty minutes, and with my hair type, that&#x27;s really saying something!&lt;br /&gt;This comes with the base and five different sized interchangeable barrels. The pieces go together and come apart easily and the lock is easy to use.  It heats up really fast and leaves hair looking flawless! I am so happy to recieve this awesome curling iron to review. I would recommend this to absolutely everyone I know!</li>
    <li> Solid 3.5 to 4 star item for me and here&#x27;s why: I purchased this for the variety of sizes and types of curling wands/rods.  I&#x27;m 48, have thin color treated hair and haven&#x27;t purchased new curling irons in years and years, and I like the &amp;#34;Clamp&amp;#34; type better than the newer types of wrap around style rods that my 17 year old uses all the time, as I HATE HATE HATE those pointy looking ends those no clamp rods leave, so I was looking for a combo that had both.  This was it! The photo only shows four, but it has FIVE &amp;#34;plug in&amp;#34; type of wands/rods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;* Has several clamp type of rods, and I love the &amp;#34;CLAMP of old school&amp;#34; curling irons&lt;br /&gt;* Has 3 different barrel sizes with the clips/clamp style&lt;br /&gt;* Has 2 different ROD sizes for the wrap around style  (one tapered, one straight)&lt;br /&gt;* Gets hot QUICK&lt;br /&gt;* Cools down fairly quickly as well when off&lt;br /&gt;* Swivel type cord is paired with a longer length cord for more freedom of movement&lt;br /&gt;* Curls set quick, and seem to last all day &amp; all night for me&lt;br /&gt;* Heat resistant case is nice to travel with (cool them off to at least WARM before putting them in, as it is thin and will still transfer heat, or melt the cord from the base if too hot and touching a rod/wand)&lt;br /&gt;* I found that switching out the barrels was easy, not hard, just a good tug pulls them off (do this when they are COOL!)&lt;br /&gt;* Clamp irons have a kick stand to set on counter area&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;* NO COOL TOUCH TIP with the clamp/clip style!  Out of habit, I reached for the tip to get better control of the iron when I was unrolling and I burned myself the first time, thinking these were like my old clamp/clip style that have a cool touch tip, these have none! SO BE CAREFUL!  This also is a HUGE negative for me, as the control is taken away a bit if I can&#x27;t hold the end like my old fashioned curling irons when needed!  I also have to stop myself for reaching up to touch the tip when I want to unwind my hair from the iron.. UGH.. kind of frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* NO HEAT PROOF GLOVE!  SO.. no cool touch tips, and they give you NO heat proof glove to use with these!  BIG NO NO in my book.  I had to borrow one of my daughter&#x27;s (which she eventually just up and gave me because she had a couple) so I could manage this without hurting myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Connection about 1.5 inches from below where the iron seats/mounted gets hot.  So going down the actual hand held portion can get hot towards the top, I don&#x27;t want to put my hand anywhere beyond the clamp trigger, or I&#x27;ll feel the heat or get burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Does not have a temperature readout, or an adjustment.  You get HOT fast, but that is all you get.  No control other than an on/off switch and a red light to indicate it is on.  This was not a big deal for me, but my daughter said it was for her.  When I curl my hair, I just want it to get hot quick, and this does, but my daughter is the wand connoisseur ... and she says the temp readout &amp;/or adjustment is essential.  But not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: FOR THE PRICE of $39 and free shipping from Amazon, it was a great deal, best of both worlds of clamps and wands, in a neat travel bag.  Love the flexibility, HATE the no cool tips on the clamp model wands and NO INCLUDED HEAT RESISTANT GLOVE, and the fact it gets hot on the base close to the insertion site of the wand/rod.  BUT.. Curls are quick and last a long time, I am keeping it, but this is a SOLID 3.5 Star item for me, but I gave it a 4 star on this review.  Could be better, but for the price, this is a good set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 8/4/2016: By the reviews, I see the company has now included a heat resistant glove, KUDOS for that!  I&#x27;ve traveled to Hawaii, Punta Cana, and different states and this is my GO TO carry bag and curling iron I take with me all the time.  Still working wonderful, just watch those fingers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 9/7/2016: When I purchased this back in Jan of 2015, there was only THIS PRESET TEMP version with NO AUTO OFF!! One comment for my review said something about an auto off for this iron. THIS DOES NOT HAVE AN AUTO OFF!!!  Only the newer Temp Control version DOES! So read the specs BEFORE you buy people! The PRESET does NOT have AUTO OFF, ONLY the TEMPERATURE CONTROL Version of this iron does!!  So if you buy this PRESET TEMP version, like I did, you are going to have to MANUALLY turn the darn thing off.  So REMEMBER to do it!RESET TEMP version with NO AUTO OFF!! One comment for my review said something about an auto off for this iron. THIS DOES NOT HAVE AN AUTO OFF!!!  Only the newer Temp Control version DOES! So read the specs BEFORE you buy people! The PRESET does NOT have AUTO OFF, ONLY the TEMPERATURE CONTROL Version of this iron does!!  So if you buy this PRESET TEMP version, like I did, you are going to have to MANUALLY turn the darn thing off.  So REMEMBER to do it!</li>
    <li> When I purchased I didn&#x27;t realize that it did not have a protective cover at the tip of curling iron.  So I kept burning myself especially since I have to hold with one hand to curl.  It does get hot and does the job, but an unsafe and uncomfortable hold.</li>
    <li> My order came really fast... Amazing set for the price... but I think it would be nice if it came with a glove.  I didn&#x27;t realize the end of the wands didn&#x27;t have the heating protection. Overall great set.</li>
    <li> The curling iron is very nice. it is good quality. The reason for 4 stars is literally the 2nd time I unzipped the bag the zipper Broke off. thankfully amazon is giving me a new bag. It&#x27;s quite a hassle but they are amazing! They also refunded my shipping and handling. This is why I only shop on amazon. Also there is no cool part to hold onto at the end so that takes getting used to. If you have a heat resistant glove it won&#x27;t be a problem but one is not included. I knew this before I ordered though. All in all its a good product I just happened to get a defective bag.</li>
    <li> I love it. Perfect!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love these curlers because I get the perfect curls ever time I will continue to shop with them worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she LOVES it. She says its amazing... like to the point that she even asked me to write this review. You can also easily remove the hair clips for looser/beachy curls (her words). However, she does has extremely thick, healthy hair. I have read that it can burn thin hair, so keep that in mind.</li>
    <li> This is the coolest curling set I have ever seen! It has three barrel sizes, as well as two wand sizes, and they all make great curls. The iron heats very fast, and I like that the cords free spins and you curl, so there is no tangle up. There is no temperature control on this iron, but you will know when it is ready to use. The only downside that I have found, it that there is no cool touch tip, like traditional curling irons have, but other than that, this is a great set. Each of the traditional barrels, has a resting foot, to keep the iron off of the countertop surface, and the wands rest above the counter without need of a resting foot.</li>
    <li> This 5-1 curling iron is a great tool to have without having many other products that do the same thing. There are 3 curling iron barrels with a clip and 2 curling wands (no clip). The variety of sizes makes it easy to find a look to go with anything. The barrels are made with ceramic tourmaline which &amp;#34;emits negative ions that counteract the positive ions present in dry or damaged hair helping seal moisture into your hair and decrease frizz&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Switching the barrels is very simple and there aren&#x27;t any tricks that would make you get confused. You simply put the one you want in and turn the base to the &amp;#34;Lock&amp;#34;&#x27; position. To remove it turn it to the &amp;#34;unlock&amp;#34; position and pull it off. Like all of XTAVA products I have used, there is a 8 ft. 360* swivel cord so you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting tangled up while moving the curler around on your head. I LOVE the auto shut off function. I have walked out of the house many times and left my straightener on so this gives me peace of mind. It also comes with a heat resistant bag that make it easy to store away and travel with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product. I have medium hair that I like to change up frequently and I have been able to use every barrel so far to get a look that I like. My favorite has been the 1.25&amp;#34; barrel (biggest one with clip) to achieve beach waves. The ONLY 2 things I dislike is the fact that you can&#x27;t adjust the temperature and it heats up all the way to the end, there is not space not hold the end. Having thinner hair makes me nervous with using products that get super hot. For sure use a heat protector and if you&#x27;re used to using two hands you will have to get a heat glove (not included) or adjust to using one hand. I highly recommend this to everyone who enjoys getting different sized curls without buying multiple devices.&lt;br /&gt;*Product provided for quality testing *All opinions are my own</li>
    <li> I went natural over a year ago and do not apply heat to my hair very often. Since I have gotten these curlers I have curled my hair twice in one month!!! I used the wand in the picture and I had the most amazing spirals ever. I also used the middle sized curler and loved it. It gets nice and hot pretty fast which makes it easy to get your hair done even in a rush.  I was so excited to receive this product to try out and review with my honest and unbiased opinion.  And I will definitely be telling all of my family and friends about this product.</li>
    <li> Good product. Would be better if it included a heat resistant glove</li>
    <li> Beautiful set of irons in a carrying case for easy transport. Heats up quickly. Easy to use. Great product!</li>
    <li> This a great product. It creates the best curls ever!! My only issue is there&#x27;s no temperature control. It only has one setting, but other thAn that I definitely recommend this productðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š</li>
    <li> Lucile,  thank you for the email regarding your product. I bought this  professional 5 in 1 curling iron for my daughter WHOM LOVES This tool.  She can do many exciting and wonderful hair styles with this product.  The temperature is perfect to create beautiful curls, waves, and other styles.  The many different sizes helps her create just perfect curl or swirl.  This product is a true gem, and I am pleased that she is pleased with this product.  THANK YOU LUCILE for creating and developing this wonderful, useful, and high performing product:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. Please this is also a very high quality product which will last many years to come! Hopefully I can add a photo later because she is quite pleased with her handiwork.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma&#x27;s MOM:)</li>
    <li> Great at keeping the curl in my hair but you need to use a good heat protectant on your hair.  The iron does not have a control setting for the heat and it fets extremely hot and has caused some split ends but after a trim and a good protectant issue solved</li>
    <li> Incredible!  Professional quality</li>
    <li> I got this XTAVA professional 5-in-1 Curling Iron in the mail,opened it up and wanted to try it as soon as possible! I always see girls/celebrities with the loose wave look on t.v. and wanted to try it on myself since I already have wavy hair. I pulled the iron out of the thermal pouch it came in and attached the biggest barrel with the clamp on it and locked it in place.The iron did not take very long at all to heat up which is great if you are in a hurry and need to get ready fast.Once it heated up I curled up a section of my hair and left it curled up for about 15 minutes,when I released the clamp ,out came the most beautiful bouncy curls I&#x27;ve ever seen! I was in love with this look! I&#x27;ve only ever tried the biggest barrel so far but,that one alone is the worth the money,not to mention that it also came with two other barrels with clamps both in two different sizes and two regular barrels minus the clamps for various looks.Overall this iron is a good investment if your looking for a high end iron that is constructed well and will give you beautiful curls in a snap.&lt;br /&gt;I got this product free for purpose of review all claims and views are 100 percent my own.</li>
    <li> Great set! Gets very hot and curls last all day. Only con is that The clips dont hold the hair unless you use very thick pieces of hair. Overall great item and great price</li>
    <li> I have been enjoying the 5 in 1 curling iron by Xtava. My hair has always been pretty hard to hold a curl. In the past I have tried curling it and it ends up just falling flat. That is why I love this 5 in 1 curling iron. The first one I tried was the smallest spiral barrel. My hair curled, seriously better than I have ever seen my hair. I loved it and it held the curl until I washed my hair. The interchangeable curling iron offers 5 different ceramic barrels of different shapes and sizes. From beachy waves to tight curls. And everything in between. Ceramic tourmaline technology will ensure that your hair remains safe and smooth with shiny curls, lasting all day long. Tourmaline emits negative ions that counteract the positive ions present in dry or damaged hair, helping seal moisture into your hair and decrease frizz. It has an 8 foot and 360 degree swivel cord. Also with a convenient auto shut off function. I received this product complimentary for testing/review purposes, but only recommend products I believe are good and would personally use.</li>
    <li> Curls well,  love the different attachments.  Love the long cord, still not used to it not having a protective end.</li>
    <li> I love the versatility of the product (the 5 different options). It heats up quickly and the curls last throughout the day. The only area of improvement would be to have a tip at the end that I can touch/hold when I&#x27;m curling my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair kept the curls...when usually the curls fall out! It&#x27;s an amazing product and easy to use. I would definitely recommend for anybody who needs a curling iron to try these. They are perfect!</li>
    <li> It heats quickly and comes with a variety of curl barrel types.  Doesn&#x27;t damage my hair, which is extra-fine, in fact leaves it looking less frizzy than before.  It should include heat-protective gloves, though, since you are practically guaranteed to burn your fingers, so ... one star off.</li>
    <li> I have never used it, but my daughter likes it, although there is a definite learning curve without a clip or a glove to protect your hands.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I just tried the 1 inch curling iron. Made silky curls that lasted all night. Love the packaging and look of the product.</li>
    <li> This works wonders. Love it just make sure you buy the glove so you dont get burned. For that price is better than what I tought 😊👍👍👍</li>
    <li> Xtava is by far the best I have found. I own several of their products and I like them so much, all my other brands went in the trash. Love love love the silk edition black storage bag!</li>
    <li> Great but needs a glove for those of us used to placing our fingers on the tip of curler when winding hair!</li>
    <li> I like that you are able to have basically 5 different curling irons in one you just snap the size you want on lock it and start curling I used this on my 13 year old daughter her hair is super fine and straight basically the toughest to curl we did not have any hairspray at the time so we were relying on the curling iron to work its magic we basically expected it to fail but I will say that it proved us wrong even after we stepped outside in the Florida humidity the curls stayed albeit not as well as they will once we use the hairspray and curling prep but she was way to excited about the curling iron to wait for all of that. I will recommend this to anyone that is looking for a great curling iron that can perform many different hair styles from waves to super tight curls. I think honestly this was my daughters favorite gift from everything I had gotten her so thank you Xtava for providing us with this wonderful curling iron to test out!</li>
    <li> I have been wanting an interchangeable curling iron forever so this was a good option to try out and at a very affordable price.  I did not notice when shopping around that all the pieces came in a case for easy storage plus it is a heat resistant case, so that is a HUGE plus.  I really like all the different options of barrels and also that there is just one on/off switch.  The iron heats up very quickly, I think mine took about a minute and 15 seconds.  These are easy to use, the curl seems to take much faster than traditional curling irons and it also held well.  I am super excited to have this is in my collection!</li>
    <li> OMG I love this curling iron so much. It is very easy to use as compare to other curling iron. It is easy to change the barrels. It is very secure to use this curling iron because it has a circle which secures the barrel. The barrels fit well with the iron.&lt;br /&gt;The box comes with a 3 curler clips and 2 curling wand. The packaging is pretty decent. It is perfect for a present. Everything is packed in a zipped bag. I am so impressed with the packaging. The quality of the curling iron is decent.&lt;br /&gt;It does not  show any temperature control but it heats up pretty fast. It approximately takes 30-45 secs to heat up. It works great on my thick hair. In general I hate to curl my hair I have too many hair and it takes me hours to curl them but with this curling iron my work was done pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed with this curling iron. After trying so many curling iron/wands I am satisfied with this curling iron. It has different sizes of barrels and I can style my hair according to my choice. I like to have small curls on both sides of my front hair but for back on longer hair I like loose curls.&lt;br /&gt;I received this curling iron in exchange of a honest opinion but it didnt effect my thought. I am so lucky to have this curling iron for my lovely styles. ( I can show my hair that is how I love my hair loose and big curls)</li>
    <li> I love the design and the travel package however I do not like that there is not a cool tip end on the two irons with a clip.  Therefore if you&#x27;re used to using two hands to curl your hair you are probably going to burn your left hand.  Also, there are no temperature controls.  One temperature only.</li>
    <li> These are good to have. Keeps you from buying individual curling irons.</li>
    <li> I loved it, I received quick.  I love the way it makes my hair feel.  I just wish it came with a heat protective glove for first time users.</li>
    <li> This is excellent value and a great product.  All 5 tools are easy to switch in and out.  It comes with a padded foil nylon carrying bag.  I&#x27;ve read some reviewers say they wish it came with a heating glove, but honestly it has not been a problem for me.  The finish is very smooth and I think this helps to make my curls more natural looking and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use a cheap stainless steel curler.  After using this product, I will never go back to inexpensive tools again.  I get compliments on my hair whenever I curl now, and was asked the other day if I had gotten a digital perm (see picture for example of digital perm; i was able to achieve a similar look with the XTAVA).  I said no, i curled it myself, and was met with disbelief that a home tool could achieve a process that requires a professional salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tool makes my curls last for days.  It comes with one heat setting -- initially, i thought this would be a concern and affect the performance.  however, i now feel it was a great design and i get consistent hair results every time.</li>
