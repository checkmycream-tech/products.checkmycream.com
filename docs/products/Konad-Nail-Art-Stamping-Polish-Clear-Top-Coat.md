### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Superb quality, would buy again.</li>
      <li>and I get both with what I use so although this product was good and did its job its all in what you prefer!!!</li>
      <li>great and doesnt make the stamp \\&quot;run\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Very nice shine, looks like it sparkles.</li>
      <li>I liked the product, it worked great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good topcoat to use after nail stamping, but I also feel that Seche Vite or Poshe works just as well too.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Makes a nice top coat.  </li>
      <li>Good price and product, fun to use with the nail art image plates.</li>
      <li>I love the konad brand and this is a must top coat for the nail stamping art.</li>
      <li>Works great , the top coat dries fast and doesn&#x27;t smear the print.</li>
      <li>Has a better finish than the gel I get at the salon.</li>
      <li>i love this because it dries faster than others i&#x27;ve tried and doesnt smear the polish or chip it off</li>
      <li>Use Konad for nail stamps and Konad top coat to preserve your art work.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as a top coat at all....</li>
      <li>The top liquified the bottom coat.</li>
      <li>After watching a lot of youtube tutorials on stamping, everyone has convinced me to buy this top coat so it wont smear the designs.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried others, this is my top pick.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
      <li>but since I am now a lover of stamping I decided to try the right top coat!  </li>
      <li>It is not the special nail art top coat shown in the picture.</li>
      <li>You just shouldn&#x27;t throw a top coat on right after applying your stamp or else of course its going to smear no matter what top coat you use.</li>
      <li>Ether way its worth buying if you go through top coats quickly!</li>
      <li>But smearing wise the result is the same no matter what top coat you use.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and gave cool and shiny look.</li>
      <li>then the other side  works great would recommend if your top coat are smearing your image stamp</li>
      <li>This is my favorite clear top coat after nail stamping.  </li>
      <li>Nothing special about it.</li>
      <li>It dries very fast but because of the stamp polish it covers it has to go on with a max 3 very fast AND light brush strokes to keep from smearing the artwork.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fun and brings out the artist in you.</li>
      <li>Bought this to go with the kit because I believe you should try to use all compliant products with their own it works well with the stamper, quick dry.</li>
      <li>The chemicals in other top coats can smear and dissolve the stamp design that you worked so hard to perfect.</li>
      <li>but i used other top coats and it was fine.</li>
      <li>:  I use a quick dry top coat with the background/base colors of nail polish on my nail.  </li>
      <li>Its personally up to you whether you want to use the brand top coat with the stamping polish or not.</li>
      <li>This is the only top coat polish that I use when I stamp with Konad</li>
      <li>It was shaped more like a regular nail polish bottle.</li>
      <li>I Love this top coat I would definitely recommend because it will not smear your stamping image unless you paint over your image to hard I do it lightly and in 3 steps go over with your top coat in the middle</li>
      <li>Once dry, I then stamp the images onto my nail and top it off with this.</li>
      <li>and It is pretty good not to smear the stamp, but the reason I only gave it 4 stars is because it takes FOREVER to dry!!!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to contain much solution.</li>
      <li>Any other top coat would smear my stamp image.</li>
      <li>Its an alright top coat; Its a little thick but holds good.</li>
      <li>but however I found my nail color ships less when I use this top coat vs seche vete when using stamping.</li>
      <li>Only order this product of you are expecting the regular top coat from Konad.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use the one I have because I like the shininess on nails and the quick dry</li>
      <li>Goes on really easy, doesn&#x27;t take too long to dry.</li>
      <li>With a little practice, you will not smudge the stamped images with this thick high gloss top coat.  </li>

    <li> I do like it and It is pretty good not to smear the stamp, but the reason I only gave it 4 stars is because it takes FOREVER to dry!!! I put it on before I go to bed, so I wont have a chance to nick them up!</li>
    <li> Bottle was smaller than advertised</li>
    <li> After watching a lot of youtube tutorials on stamping, everyone has convinced me to buy this top coat so it wont smear the designs. But it still does smear the designs. but however I found my nail color ships less when I use this top coat vs seche vete when using stamping. But smearing wise the result is the same no matter what top coat you use.</li>
    <li> I give it two stars instead of one because they gave me a refund. Only order this product of you are expecting the regular top coat from Konad. It is not the special nail art top coat shown in the picture.</li>
    <li> The chemicals in other top coats can smear and dissolve the stamp design that you worked so hard to perfect. Use Konad for nail stamps and Konad top coat to preserve your art work.</li>
    <li> Good price and product, fun to use with the nail art image plates. Makes a nice top coat.  Recommend product</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and gave cool and shiny look. But didn&#x27;t even last for 2 days.</li>
    <li> I liked the product, it worked great. It doesn&#x27;t smear the stamped stencil like others I have used. It seems to help the nail polish last longer.</li>
    <li> No directions or literature sent with polish</li>
    <li> Its an alright top coat; Its a little thick but holds good. A lot of people say that this polish prevents smearing of the stamp but i used other top coats and it was fine.
