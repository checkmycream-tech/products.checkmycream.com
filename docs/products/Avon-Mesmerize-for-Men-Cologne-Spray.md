      <li>I love the fragrance.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;m glad to see it at this price.</li>
      <li>.... love</li>
      <li>This is my favorite calogne.</li>
      <li>The cologne is a blend of myrrh, precious woods, and exotic spices that are accented with mandarin and bergamot.</li>
      <li>i love it</li>
      <li>and I enjoy the compliments women give me,if you want a  good clean smell \\&quot;mesmerize\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I have had many people tell me how great it is when they are standing near me.</li>
      <li>I bought this cologne because it seemed like a good price, and I recall my aunt and other family members talking about how great this cologne smelled to them years ago.  </li>
      <li>It has a appealing scent that doesn&#x27;t fade right away like most inexpensive colognes..</li>
      <li>For the price this takes you back to your teenage years great price for a great Cologne i love it.</li>
      <li>younger lol.</li>
      <li>This cologne is great for a very low cost.</li>
      <li>and he really likes the fragrance smells nice.</li>
      <li>so this was primarily based on price and what I have heard about it.  </li>
      <li>This might make a good addition to be applied fresh out of the shower for an even more soft fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>Very good price is the same as catalog but delivery is much faster</li>
      <li>I keep myself clean</li>
      <li>very good---all the women love the smell---it turns them on---</li>
      <li>very good cologne spray i will buy again in the near future</li>
      <li>Great colonge reminds me of obession for men by calvin kleine has similar scent.. and last a long timecon the skin the ladys love it to me its more of a evening colonge .</li>
      <li>so I recommend it to all other guys who wanna smell good too...</li>
      <li>The scent is not very manly (in my opinion) they could easily take off the label \\&quot;for Men\\&quot; and apply \\&quot;for Women\\&quot; and it could pass easily.  </li>
      <li>;-)</li>
      <li>Perhaps this might be more of a neutral cologne scent such as CK-One.  </li>
      <li>Wore this a lot as a teen, and love the smell but NOT seeing the tracking</li>
      <li>avon can never fail you on product</li>
      <li>AND LASTS PRETTY WELL.</li>
      <li>I was surprised when I found out my new favorite cologne is an Avon product.</li>
      <li>Favorite cologne in the whole entire world!(disclaimer)</li>
      <li>I love this cologne, the only one I really wear and everyone loves the scent.</li>
      <li>This fragrance is a very nice men&#x27;s cologne which is subtle and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>I have tried several Avon colognes for men, but this is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>so i had to find it online thanks for bringing me back memories.</li>
      <li>With Amazon&#x27;s fast service and great prices you cannot go wrong!!</li>
      <li>I have purchased much more expensive colognes in the past and never gotten as many compliments as I do with this stuff.</li>

    <li> I Was Very Pleased Thank You.5 star.</li>
    <li> My nephew received Avon&#x27;s Mesmerize as part of a holiday gift set, and he didn&#x27;t care for it. I think it&#x27;s a great scent, and my brother thinks it smells a lot like Obsession. The cologne is a blend of myrrh, precious woods, and exotic spices that are accented with mandarin and bergamot. If you want a nice smelling cologne without a high-end price, give Mesmerize a try.</li>
    <li> Was a knockoff.  Reimbursement was given.</li>

    <li> Very good price is the same as catalog but delivery is much faster</li>
    <li> very good---all the women love the smell---it turns them on---I have tried many but this is the best for the bang</li>
    <li> i always get copliments when i wear this from women And men, i think it smells great and it stays with you all day and doesnt fade away before ur day ends :-)</li>
    <li> Favorite cologne in the whole entire world!(disclaimer) This scent may not be for every man.This was also a Christmas present for my husband.</li>
    <li> I got some Mezmerize for Christmas one year and just loved it.  Everyone tells me what a wonderful scent it is and asks me what it is.  I&#x27;ve been ordering it ever since.  It&#x27;s been about 8 years.</li>
    <li> I have tried several Avon colognes for men, but this is by far my favorite. I get lots of compliments when I wear this ... though it is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> This product arrived at my home leaking from the bottle. And I had to throw it away. So not only would I not purchase it again. But I would not recommend it to anyone at. Of the many colognes that they have for purchase. This one was not a good choice.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance.  My wife also. And its not pricey at all. Just a good aroma for the money</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;m 63, and to hear &amp;#34;Mmmm you smell good&amp;#34; from the ladies is always a day brightener. ;-)</li>
    <li> This fragrance is a very nice men&#x27;s cologne which is subtle and not overpowering. My boyfriend loved it two year&#x27;s ago when I gave this cologne to him for his birthday.  When I ask him what he would like for Valentine&#x27;s Day, Birthday, Christmas, etc., he asks me for Mesmerize.</li>
    <li> This cologne is the only one I use. I started using it about 12 years ago when I recieved it as a gift. I was surprised when I found out my new favorite cologne is an Avon product. Go figure huh. Anyway I often get good remarks from peo poeple who compliment then ask what it is I&#x27;m wearing that smells so good. Well I guess smelling good is better than not smelling good so I recommend it to all other guys who wanna smell good too...</li>
    <li> When you order from your Avon rep. you have to wait for them to put the order in and then wait for it to come in and then wait for them to bring it to you.  With Amazon&#x27;s fast service and great prices you cannot go wrong!!</li>
    <li> This cologne was a last minute order for my dad.&lt;br /&gt;He loves this cologne made by AVON.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cologne arrived very quickly and my DAD loved IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> It is excellent, a gift for my father.. He loves this cologne but couldn&#x27;t find it in stores</li>
    <li> Fast service and the best price!</li>
    <li> Product was great, my wife likes the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;The deliver time was later than the the projected date.</li>
    <li> My husband didn&#x27;t care for it, either did I.</li>
    <li> ladies love the smell</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Mesmerize on my honey!!!</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely horrible!</li>
    <li> Good product, fair price and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite calogne. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and doubt I will ever switch it up. yep.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL SMELL...AND LASTS PRETTY WELL.</li>
    <li> my very best everyone asked me what im wearing. i love it</li>
    <li> I used to buy this overpriced from a cosmetics store until I knew I could it from Amazon at a fraction of its price. Can&#x27;t be more happy!!!</li>
    <li> I had this cologne once before , but never at this price. My son smelled it on me and said he had to have some for himself.  I&#x27;m glad to see it at this price. A++ seller.</li>
    <li> I bought Mesmerize for my dad. Its his favorite cologne. He loves this scent more than any other designer brand I&#x27;ve bought him in the past.</li>
    <li> It was good it arrived safe</li>
    <li> Mesmerize is a nice variant to add to anyone&#x27;s cologne collection..It has a appealing scent that doesn&#x27;t fade right away like most inexpensive colognes..</li>
    <li> Wore this a lot as a teen, and love the smell but NOT seeing the tracking and it&#x27;s been 3 weeks almost.</li>
    <li> For the price this takes you back to your teenage years great price for a great Cologne i love it.</li>
    <li> Utter disappointment. The smell is very faint and is gone in 5 minutes. I suspect this is a fake or a very old bottle that has lost all its potency. Completely useless.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne because it seemed like a good price, and I recall my aunt and other family members talking about how great this cologne smelled to them years ago.  Previously I have never smelled or owned this cologne so this was primarily based on price and what I have heard about it.  I sprayed my shirt two times and tried to rate the product based off of that time, and the next day with its lasting strength.  It is a very weak cologne and a few sprays will not last very long at all.  The price is excellent, and packaging is great.  The scent is not very manly (in my opinion) they could easily take off the label \\&quot;for Men\\&quot; and apply \\&quot;for Women\\&quot; and it could pass easily.  Perhaps this might be more of a neutral cologne scent such as CK-One.  This might make a good addition to be applied fresh out of the shower for an even more soft fresh scent.  I have revisited the rating for this cologne, I feel this is just too feminine for me, I had to give it away.</li>
    <li> I had a Mesmerize and was different than this, it only lasted 3 or 4 hours and then I had lasted until the other day in my clothes, for that I think this was fake.</li>
    <li> This cologne is great for a very low cost. Need an attention getter or just something pleasant to wear that doesn&#x27;t smell like everyone else..?? This is a great choice.</li>
    <li> This cologne is both inexpensive and delicious. What more needs to be said? Go ahead and click \\&quot;add to cart\\&quot;!!</li>
    <li> avon can never fail you on product i wore this back in middle school one of my fav. so i had to find it online thanks for bringing me back memories.</li>
    <li> one bottle will not spray, does not work</li>
    <li> The cologne is outstanding for the price. I have had many people tell me how great it is when they are standing near me.</li>
    <li> Great colonge reminds me of obession for men by calvin kleine has similar scent.. and last a long timecon the skin the ladys love it to me its more of a evening colonge .</li>
    <li> This cologne smells great. I have purchased much more expensive colognes in the past and never gotten as many compliments as I do with this stuff.</li>
    <li> Does not seem to have a lasting scent.</li>
