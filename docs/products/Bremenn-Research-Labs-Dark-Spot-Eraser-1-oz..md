      <li>Honestly I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Except I kind of have a SOUL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t see any change in my skin but a nice cream...</li>
      <li>I have use it for about two months and reordered more just to give it a fair change to work.</li>
      <li>Just received the product this week, so don&#x27;t have a lot to say yet, but I have been looking for this product for months because I have heard so many good things about it.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m hoping for an OTC product that will be more effective.</li>
      <li>I got some from Myuami for $15 (made from Shark fins, popular in Asia &amp; becoming popular here).</li>
      <li>I was hoping I&#x27;d be one of the lucky ones that would have good results.  </li>
      <li>There has to be something better out there to try.</li>
      <li>I keep reading that this product works in many magazines.  </li>
      <li>I am completely satisfied.</li>
      <li>you want the vote of my WI relatives, Sen. Herbert Kohl, your store had better refund</li>
      <li>as most products take 4-6 weeks before you see results.  </li>
      <li>this really works and have ordered it again - the best on the market and worth the money.</li>
      <li>well worth the price!!  </li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s quick and easy to use!</li>
      <li>Good for any older people.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work real great for erasing dark spots.</li>
      <li>Since I started using this product I have seen a tremendous change in my skin!</li>
      <li>and you will be happy and younger looking.</li>
      <li>I think it is to early to tell if the product is as good as as advertised.</li>
      <li>It did not fade the dark spot at all and more surprisingly, it didn&#x27;t even fade the very light spot.  </li>
      <li>I had some uneven skin tone and this cream has done amazing results!!</li>
      <li>On me, my skin type it works the best so far in comparison to many other products I have tried and tossed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my 60s and have many brown spots that really bother me on my face.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for removing dark spots from your face.</li>
      <li>when I used the dark eraser, I worked great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep using it until the tube is empty and will be able to make a more  accurate report..</li>
      <li>just read about something somewhere that is like, 98% more effective than Vitamin C for dark spots.</li>
      <li>Again, it will probably take a while to determine the success of this product.</li>
      <li>I learned that the cream has to be completely absorbed in skin--rub until it disappears.</li>
      <li>But I am pleased so far.</li>
      <li>Dark Spots remain , however I do not claim that more effort or further use by needing more of this product would not help more.</li>
      <li>This is the first I&#x27;ve tried it--but it seems to be working-- &#x3D;</li>
      <li>After using it for more than a month, no even a tiny difference in the spots.</li>
      <li>Well, I paid $59 for this at Kohl&#x27;s (first mistake).</li>
      <li>First of all, the product is not a foam like it advertises...</li>
      <li>This product did not state clinical strength on label whereas the first tube did.  </li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t be seeing much sun!</li>
      <li>I will most definitely purchase this after the bottle my dad sent is gone</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m getting ready to order another!</li>
      <li>I followed directions exactly and the spots weren&#x27;t even lightened.</li>
      <li>Really works!</li>
      <li>Well worth the reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much differences in the spot removal aspect, but it is a good makeup to help cover the spots up a little.</li>
      <li>However there seems to be some positive results...</li>
      <li>love it Haven;t used it long</li>
      <li>It takes more than 3 bottles to fade brown spots but still not completely gone.</li>
      <li>Results are visible and fast.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so much happier.</li>
      <li>So, I really do believe in this product but using it is a commitment to time and faithfully using it twice a day every day.</li>
      <li>Meant to be spot applied, not over your whole face or</li>
      <li>A very generous amount in the tube.</li>
      <li>Makes me wonder if we can really trust what we see in magazines now.  </li>
      <li>those will also be much lighter.</li>
      <li>Product did not work at all, very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I did absolutely NOTHING.  </li>
      <li>I like to say thank you so much .</li>
      <li>By then, I should really know if it works.</li>
      <li>Like everyone who orders a spot eraser cream, I really wanted it to work.</li>
      <li>Two weeks didn&#x27;t see much of difference, but then they gradually fade away.  </li>
      <li>but I wanted to give this product the benefit of the doubt since it is advertised so much in magazines.  </li>
      <li>Have used for weeks now and do not see much change at all.  </li>
      <li>too much money</li>
      <li>There are a lot of other products currently available that claim to lessen dark spots so it would be nice to have chosen the correct one for me the first time.</li>
      <li>Perhaps better than any of the other brands I have tried.</li>
      <li>At first, she said it looked like it was working to clear the age spots on her cheeks.</li>
      <li>I have bought many different types of beauty products from amazon or products amazon offers and this is the first time I&#x27;ve felt compelled to write a review because I&#x27;m so relieved I finally found something that worked.</li>
      <li>I had previously gone to the dermatologist for \\&quot;malasma\\&quot; on my face - and this product works even better.  </li>
      <li>It worked way better than the more expensive brand by Clinique that I was using.  </li>
      <li>I tried it on two older spots, and on one lighter new spot, and all improved.</li>
      <li>I have used it on old acne discolored spots and I haven&#x27;t noticed as much of a change as I have on the melasma.</li>
      <li>I have one dark brown spot on my right cheek and one very light, barely visible spot on my left cheek.  </li>
      <li>and I used this product exactly as instructed - 2xs daily and massaged it into my brown spots each time.  </li>
      <li>but maybe those are for other types of discoloration like acne scars because like I mentioned I haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference in those, only slight, but I do feel after a couple more weeks</li>
      <li>I would not waste your money on this product.  </li>
      <li>Then 4 weeks into it I developed itchy, crusty patches on my face.  </li>
      <li>Using it for over 2 weeks and so far I don&#x27;t notice any changes.</li>
      <li>Since the Bremenn was the only thing I had changed in my skin care regimen I knew it was responsible.  </li>
      <li>nearly gone.  </li>
      <li>I have been using the product as directed, but so far the spots remain.</li>
      <li>Seeing god results on my 60 year old skin that has been inthe sun quite a bit.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m seriously surprised at the lower reviews</li>
      <li>It seemed to work so far.</li>
      <li>Hoping it works because, so far I haven&#x27;t had any luck with all the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>So far this product has not performed as advertised,  I am continuing to use it hoping for the results that is claimed for it</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Unfortunately this product did not help my brown spots at all.  I gave it ample time to work (5 weeks) as most products take 4-6 weeks before you see results.  I have one dark brown spot on my right cheek and one very light, barely visible spot on my left cheek.  It did not fade the dark spot at all and more surprisingly, it didn&#x27;t even fade the very light spot.  I am really disappointed!  I keep reading that this product works in many magazines.  However when I read the reviews there were definitely mixed reviews but I wanted to give this product the benefit of the doubt since it is advertised so much in magazines.  Makes me wonder if we can really trust what we see in magazines now.  I was hoping I&#x27;d be one of the lucky ones that would have good results.  Unfortunately, I was not and I used this product exactly as instructed - 2xs daily and massaged it into my brown spots each time.  No results at all.  I would not waste your money on this product.  There has to be a product out there that works.  If anyone knows of any, I would be happy to hear about it.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> its been over six months ....and I&#x27;m STILL waiting</li>
    <li> I followed directions exactly and the spots weren&#x27;t even lightened. Then 4 weeks into it I developed itchy, crusty patches on my face.  Since the Bremenn was the only thing I had changed in my skin care regimen I knew it was responsible.  Stopped using it and itchy, crusty places nearly gone.  Of course it is now past the \\&quot;30 day 100% Mony back Guarantee\\&quot; so I probably won&#x27;t get my money back.  I am just hoping to keep others from wasting their money on it.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for me after using as directed for a month. No spot reduction or dark spot fading. I ended up returning it.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t seem to not work</li>
    <li> It works ok, not great.</li>
    <li> Really helps with the dark discolorations on my face.</li>
    <li> I can see a slight change in the color of the few dark marks on my face. I believe it&#x27;s working. As with other products like this, I think it takes some time. But I am pleased so far.</li>
    <li> This caused my skin to get red and peel in spots.  I generally don&#x27;t have overly sensitive skin and even daily applications of retin A don&#x27;t cause any reaction or problem.</li>
    <li> ALMOST FINISHED WITH THE TUBE....i HAVE USED IT FAITHFULLY, IN THE A.M. &amp; p.m.&lt;br /&gt;and as of today there is absolutely NO change. The spots are as if I never used the Bremenn&lt;br /&gt;cream!........</li>
    <li> Although i uses this product religiously, it did not change any of the brown spots on my face.  My dermatologist said it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t see any change in my skin but a nice cream...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had melasma for 9 years and got it from birth control pills. It&#x27;s been so embarrassing and I felt that it was the only thing people noticed about my face since it&#x27;s the only thing I saw. I had it on my cheeks and upper lip (like a mustache! It was awful). I&#x27;ve had people tell me \\&quot;hey, you got some dirt on your face\\&quot;. Seriously it was super embarrassing. I have used a ton of products and even went as far as paying $700 for a professional peel and everything was to no avail. I had given up. My father actually was the one who bought this and sent it to me... It claimed on the package that some people notice a difference in minutes. Let me tell whoever reading that it did not work in minutes however it did work within days. I was amazed that my melasma spots were indeed fading. I&#x27;m sooooo happy with this product. I will most definitely purchase this after the bottle my dad sent is gone and I certainly recommend it for others who have melasma to at least try it. I have used it on old acne discolored spots and I haven&#x27;t noticed as much of a change as I have on the melasma. It&#x27;s only been a week though so perhaps on those it may take longer. Seriously, if you suffer from melasma you should try this.  It worked for me and I&#x27;m so much happier. I have bought many different types of beauty products from amazon or products amazon offers and this is the first time I&#x27;ve felt compelled to write a review because I&#x27;m so relieved I finally found something that worked. I&#x27;m seriously surprised at the lower reviews but maybe those are for other types of discoloration like acne scars because like I mentioned I haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference in those, only slight, but I do feel after a couple more weeks those will also be much lighter.</li>
    <li> Does not work well. After one month of daily and sometimes, 2XD use, it barely lightened my dark spots. Not worth the money or time spent.</li>
    <li> This cream takes along time to work but it does work!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice a day for a month now and there&#x27;s been no improvement -- the dark spots on my hands are just as dark. Waste of money. Won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> Those dreaded age spots have started to appear on the backs of my hands. I saw this product at Costco.  Even though it doesn&#x27;t contain hydroquinone (the best ingredient for getting rid of age spots) I went ahead and decided to give it a try.  I have been using it faithfully 2x day as directed for the past three weeks.  I also follow up by using 50 SPF sunscreen.  My hands are definitely showing improvement.  My age spots are definitely fading. Unfortunately this is a product that you have to use consistently or the age spots will return -- hopefully by using the sunscreen in addition to the cream that will help keep the spots from reappearing as fast.</li>
    <li> My first purchase of BRL Dark Spot Eraser was at Costco and since that time, I have been using this product for about 4 months. During the latter of this time, I have seen a significant loss and fading of dark age spots on my face and hands. So, I really do believe in this product but using it is a commitment to time and faithfully using it twice a day every day. And, that is why I purchased another package of it. Also, the purchase price on Amazon was a slightly less than Costco this time around.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work real great for erasing dark spots.</li>
    <li> This product is such a scam. Never did a thing for my small dark spots.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT product...well worth the price!!  I had previously gone to the dermatologist for \\&quot;malasma\\&quot; on my face - and this product works even better.  I WILL reorder this proctuct when I run out!!</li>
    <li> I get your cream from Costco and after using for 3 months twice daily no result whosoever. Wasted time and money. SZR</li>
    <li> Like everyone who orders a spot eraser cream, I really wanted it to work. After using the product twice a day for a month I have not seen any changes in my melasma. Can not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> useing after 10days ,nothing changed!</li>
    <li> It is too soon to tell if the product is working or not -- maybe in 2 months or so I can make a viable statement. I find it simple to use twice a day--in the morning and just before bed. Again, it will probably take a while to determine the success of this product. There are a lot of other products currently available that claim to lessen dark spots so it would be nice to have chosen the correct one for me the first time.</li>
    <li> Since I started using this product I have seen a tremendous change in my skin! I love it! I&#x27;m getting ready to order another!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. I had some uneven skin tone and this cream has done amazing results!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> My dematologist said it was useless. a total waste of money. change must come from within to chage this condition.</li>
    <li> I saw results in just a week of using this product! Will buy again Thank You</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions and didn&#x27;t see any difference. I would not order this product again even if it was on sale.</li>
    <li> The results of this product seems to be a little slow in showing results.  However there seems to be some positive results... I&#x27;ll keep using it until the tube is empty and will be able to make a more  accurate report..</li>
    <li> It helped with some facial spots but not all.  This product out-did others I have used but I&#x27;m hoping for an OTC product that will be more effective.</li>
    <li> Using it for over 2 weeks and so far I don&#x27;t notice any changes. Going to continue using it until gone. By then, I should really know if it works. Hoping it works because, so far I haven&#x27;t had any luck with all the others I&#x27;ve tried. Will change rating when I use it all up.</li>
    <li> This product works! Expensive well known names are a waste of your money. This is a great product for removing dark spots from your face.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my face but it&#x27;s way too heavy for me this time of year.  Maybe in the winter.  Couldn&#x27;t use it long enough to see results.  I use it on my hands in the meantime and it seems to be working a little bit.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on face.  Did fade some spots on hands.  Will try another product instead.  This product did not state clinical strength on label whereas the first tube did.  When I inquired, I was told to compare the concentration written on the contents but that info didn&#x27;t specify.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 3 weeks and the dark spot is definitely getting lighter.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This helps lighten the dark spots on my face. And it&#x27;s quick and easy to use! This is the first I&#x27;ve tried it--but it seems to be working-- &#x3D;+}</li>
    <li> Well, I paid $59 for this at Kohl&#x27;s (first mistake). The lady said I could have my money back if it didn&#x27;t work, so I guess I&#x27;ll go see if I can get a refund. UPDATE: Kohl&#x27;s did refund my money on a half-used tube. Two months is long enough to see if this works. I&#x27;ve used it two times a day). I&#x27;ve been using it for two months night and day, and My skin doesn&#x27;t look any different. I reallly reallly reallllly wanted this to work, because I&#x27;m SO SICK OF THESE TWO STUPID BLOTCHES on my face from birth control!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not asking for a lot. I have skin the color of Typing Paper. My blotches are the color of Toast. If this doesn&#x27;t work for me, I don&#x27;t know who it can work for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did they put some moisturizer in a tube and say \\&quot;let&#x27;s charge these chicks $59 in-store, $29 online?\\&quot; &#x27;Cause I want that job. Except I kind of have a SOUL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just read about something somewhere that is like, 98% more effective than Vitamin C for dark spots. UPDATE: It&#x27;s called Squalane oil. I got some from Myuami for $15 (made from Shark fins, popular in Asia &amp; becoming popular here). Sigh. #thestruggle. Does it ever end? :((( I ordered some from Amazon. Wish me luck!  I think I will try that, and use the $$ I get from these people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darn you, Bremenn! Darn you all to heck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want the vote of my WI relatives, Sen. Herbert Kohl, your store had better refund my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awwwwww, yeahhhhhh! I&#x27;m from Wisconsin, Herb. I know who you are, and I WENT there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hahahaha</li>
    <li> Really works! But need to be patient to get the desired results. I&#x27;m using this cream twice a day, morning and night and the brown spot that I have under  my eye is fading away.</li>
    <li> I have used the Eraser for two months, and it works for me.  I tried it on two older spots, and on one lighter new spot, and all improved.</li>
    <li> it s one of the best products i have used in my face.. with time you will seevthe difference ..</li>
    <li> Worthless, plain and simple. May work for some but did not for me. Good luck.</li>
    <li> It seems to be working. Perhaps better than any of the other brands I have tried. Have been using it for about 2 months. A very generous amount in the tube. Spots not gone, but they are fading.</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this face cream for a second time. It is a super SLOW process, but I do see improvement with the dark spots on my face. I learned that the cream has to be completely absorbed in skin--rub until it disappears.</li>
    <li> Just received the product this week, so don&#x27;t have a lot to say yet, but I have been looking for this product for months because I have heard so many good things about it.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> this really works and have ordered it again - the best on the market and worth the money.</li>
    <li> does what it says. Removes dark spots. Good for any older people.  I recommend you give it a try and you will be happy and younger looking.</li>
    <li> I have tried laser &amp; expensive dermatologist recommened brightners. I never really saw any significant changes other then my skin peeling. I bought the Berman dark spot eraser at costco and used it  as recommened. It took about 2-3 months to see the difference. After 4 months i have seen a great improvement. I wish i would have found this prior to spending about $600 in laser treatments and expensive creams from the dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I am not really sure if this product works or not. I have use it for about two months and reordered more just to give it a fair change to work. I haven&#x27;t seen much differences in the spot removal aspect, but it is a good makeup to help cover the spots up a little.</li>
    <li> Product did not work at all, very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I will never purchase this item again. Would like to get reimburse.</li>
    <li> Gradually even the darkest spots on my hands are disappearing. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 1</li>
    <li> I was great. It really eras all my dark spot. I like to say thank you so much . I like to try other products.</li>
    <li> Have only used for two days, the dark spots should take at least two to three weeks to show any difference.  I am hoping this product will erase my sun spots.</li>
    <li> The age spots have not lightened up at all. I am disappointed in this product. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this item again. I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> At first, I was skeptical too that this product will not work because I&#x27;ve tried so many different brands from inexpensive to expensive and none of them worked.  That was $$$ down the drain.  But I found this product at Costco and since they were on sale, I thought I&#x27;ll give it a try.  Well, it does work.  I kept track of the dark spots on my face and used this product as instructed.  Two weeks didn&#x27;t see much of difference, but then they gradually fade away.  Not completely gone yet but I do see the difference in about 4 weeks.  My hubby tried on his face and it worked on him too.  His seems to work faster than mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that you might want to sparingly use this product in the warmer season.  If your face/skin is oily,  too much of it might leave your face a little shiny than you&#x27;d cared for.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s taking a lot longer to lighten dark spots than I expected.  I haven&#x27;t used the entire tube yet so I hope it does the job when I do.</li>
    <li> I am 51 years old and I am Hispanic medium -dark brown complexion.  I have been using Bremenn Dark Spot Eraser for over a year.  Honestly I am very pleased with this product.  It worked way better than the more expensive brand by Clinique that I was using.  It work so well on me that after a few days my dark patches lighten and I quit using it a couple weeks and when I see my dark spots begin to appear I resume again a few days and they lighten up again. On me, my skin type it works the best so far in comparison to many other products I have tried and tossed.</li>
    <li> For the price and the description I thought I would see results by now.-not happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Tried this for about a month now. I have noticed reduced visibility of biggest, prominent dark spots by about 60% at least. I would definitely recommend this product. Meant to be spot applied, not over your whole face or if you have sensitive skin like me, then it gets red.</li>
    <li> The product didn&#x27;t work at all and I believe it is counterfeit.  I called Bremenn Labs and they stand behind their product- which has received sterling reviews- but believe I purchased a counterfeit version.  It did NOTHING.  I see this company has been accused of selling counterfeit products before and I hope Amazon does something about it.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy from this seller.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference.  I&#x27;ll keep using it until the tube is gone because maybe it takes a long time.</li>
    <li> I use this with the dark circle eraser. I became a believer if this item from this manufacturer&lt;br /&gt;because when I used the dark eraser, I worked great. So, I thought since I have some dark spots I wanted to clear up, I thought this must be worth a try. It seemed to work so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.Very disappointing. This is a pure waste of money. Won&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Why even bother to market a product that doesn&#x27;t work?</li>
    <li> Have used it every night, no results at all.  Have one dark spot that I have been targeting, was hoping it would fade.  No change.</li>
    <li> My mom used this for several months. At first, she said it looked like it was working to clear the age spots on her cheeks. But after awhile, it seemed ineffective so she stopped using it.</li>
    <li> EVEN TOOK SOME TIME USE, LIKE ME HAS GOOD AND STAIN BE REDUCED.</li>
    <li> Dark Spots remain , however I do not claim that more effort or further use by needing more of this product would not help more.</li>
    <li> The product is just no good, a waste of my $65.00 I purchased the product from Brennan Lab.&lt;br /&gt;Please, try another product don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> I have tried many brown spot creams and this is the best I have tried.  I thought I would never get rid of my brown spot. It&#x27;s almost completely gone after about 3-4 weeks. My search is over. Don&#x27;t try anything else.</li>
    <li> I think it is to early to tell if the product is as good as as advertised. However, I think I am starting to see results and may purchase another. I have tried other products without any results, so this one may be the one.  As for delivery time etc. I am completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I find this a good product, it works for me. I use it morning and night and it has definitely faded the brown spots on my face. I do think continuous use is the answer and I&#x27;m just about to order another tube although back in the UK  I won&#x27;t be seeing much sun!</li>
    <li> I have used this a couple weeks and&lt;br /&gt;can not see any diffrence. will not get it again.waste os money!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time for my trip and I small still using it.  But I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 months, and it hasn&#x27;t even lightened the spots on my hands. My dermatologist warned me that no cream could erase dark spots. It was a waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 60s and have many brown spots that really bother me on my face.Use this twice a day and you will get results.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product as directed, but so far the spots remain. It makes the skin rough and dry. I will give it another few weeks to see if I need to send it back.</li>
    <li> Made age spots go away after several days of use.  They slowly come back, so use regularly.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from Costco and used it, following strictly per company&#x27;s direction, but haven&#x27;t seen any, I mean, any improvement.&lt;br /&gt;It has been over 3 months and no sign of fading whatsoever.  Sorry very bad product. This product doesn&#x27;t even deserve a star.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two months and I can see the difference. It does take time thought, it took about 3-4 weeks before I started seeing results, but I am going to continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Have used for weeks now and do not see much change at all.  But those &amp;#34;brown age spots&amp;#34; are extremely difficult.  I&#x27;ve used laser and peels which had little impact.</li>
    <li> Do not waist your money like I did. I used it daily for 30 days and it did not affect my dark spots at all. There has to be something better out there to try.</li>
    <li> love it Haven;t used it long but I think that it is going to work</li>
    <li> The wife likes this product. She says it seems to make the dark spots lighter.Just wish the price was lower.</li>
    <li> After using it for more than a month, no even a tiny difference in the spots.</li>
    <li> Results are visible and fast. Lightening of pigmentation is noticeable in a couple of weeks. Well worth the reasonable price.</li>
    <li> So far this product has not performed as advertised,  I am continuing to use it hoping for the results that is claimed for it</li>
    <li> My dark spots no changes yet for 4 weeks used..still using it.</li>
    <li> Do not buy, does not work,</li>
    <li> too much money it did not do nothing I dont going to recoment this product to anyone i hate it</li>
    <li> Nothing has happened yet.  I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day since I received it and have seen no impbrovement.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product even though I felt it was very expensive.  Had it worked, I would have purchased it again.  I did absolutely NOTHING.  I followed the instruction religiously, and still nothing.  What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> It takes more than 3 bottles to fade brown spots but still not completely gone.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loved it!!!!</li>
    <li> Have used almost 1 tube with little result.  No adverse reactions to the product, but no significant change in dark spots.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical and only bought it because it was on sale, and I was contemplating laser zapping because I had two big blotches on my cheek.  Within a week they were significantly lighter, and now they are hardly noticeable even without makeup.  I have 50 years of sun damage so if this works for me, it should work for others.  I am buying a second tube, and it is faaaaaaar less expensive than even one trip to the dermatologist, and no down time.</li>
    <li> Bad product don&#x27;t buy. First of all, the product is not a foam like it advertises...it&#x27;s a cream. As for the results...pending until I used it.</li>
    <li> Chose the product by the reviews Seeing god results on my 60 year old skin that has been inthe sun quite a bit.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to fade dark spots as well as some other products. Will see how it does over the long run.</li>
    <li> it keeps what promisses</li>
</ol>
