      <li>I bought it for my 12 year old daughter.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s large enough for all my stuff, yet compact enough for storage and packing!</li>
      <li>I can barely for my brushes in it....</li>
      <li>The color is hot pink and it feels solid.  </li>
      <li>I thought it was gonna be bigger can&#x27;t hold too much stuff not really useful for what I needed it for</li>

    <li> Makeup cases are expensive, aren&#x27;t they? But this one is at least quality! All the other cases I&#x27;ve tried have fallen apart! This one is a beautiful purple and is great for organizing my things! It&#x27;s large enough for all my stuff, yet compact enough for storage and packing! Love the case, not the price. But its definitely worth it. Let me know if this helps :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this case over a year ago and it still functions as great as the first day I bought. The colour is beautiful(a purple addict lol)and the compartments are extremely functional in storing my make up. Am slowly running out of room for my makeup so I probably need to upgrade to a larger one or buy another in this size soon . I will diffidently keep this brand in mind.</li>
    <li> It looks just like the picture! It has a lot of room in it for your beauty products. I bought it for my 12 year old daughter. She uses it for her fingernail polish bottles.</li>
    <li> This was perfect for all of my different kinds of make up. I absolutely love it. With 4 fold out shelves its perfect for at home or on the go. Plus all of my large stuff can be stored in the bottom.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas Gift for my granddaughter.  When my granddaughter saw this case, she was tickle pink.  She said, Nana thank you so much.  It has alot of compartments to put thing.  Well worth the money</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my great granddaughter.  The box seems well made, color is an eye catcher, and the kid loves the gift. Able to fit a folding hair dryer in the bottom too.</li>
    <li> I thought that this makeup case would be larger. I kind of laughed when it came in. After I put my make-up in I realized it was perfect and miraculously all my stuff fit nicely. Small but very practical. I enjoy it very much!</li>
    <li> We got this for my daughter who is in dance competition.  The case is pretty and  durable.  There is plenty of room inside for all of her jewelry, makeup and hair pieces.  It also has a nice latch so it doesn&#x27;t accidently fall open.</li>
    <li> looks exactly like it does on the picture. 3 little compartments, and a big one for more items. Very durable and fits most of my make up. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for those with OD a lot of make up cuz it simply won&#x27;t fit. This case is made for simpler everyday stuff. I still adore it though!</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife to hold nail polish and nail swag.  She really liked it and I really liked that it emptied a drawer full of nail crap!  The color is hot pink and it feels solid.  Kinda pricey, but it should last forever.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice for a beginner, but it&#x27;s way to small... I can barely for my brushes in it.... but it&#x27;s very nice and useful for a newbie.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a teenager! The color is bright and the case is well made!</li>
    <li> As shown, very beautiful</li>
    <li> i got this for dance competition. I thought it was gonna be bigger can&#x27;t hold too much stuff not really useful for what I needed it for</li>

    <li> This pop purple makeup case is so cute not to mention pretty good size...my daughter and I just love this item!! 5 stars absolutely! !!</li>
    <li> I ordered the SOHO case 2 days ago and it arrived overnight.  A bit on the small side and the drawers don&#x27;t seem that solid but it&#x27;s decent for a small amount of makeup and the bottom compartment is great for your brushes, nail polish and jewelry etc.  Plus its nice to look at.  If you have a large collection of makeup this is not for you but its great as a travel case.</li>
    <li> The most gorgeous train case I&#x27;ve ever laid eyes on. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I brought this case for my daughter.  This is her first case and it was large enough to put all her makeup in it and clear off some room on her dresser.  The picture of the case is the true color.  This item is perfect for a young lady who is starting to wear makeup.</li>

    <li> Very cute, pretty color and lots of space.  My daughter will use this for her competitive dance team to hold all of her makeup and jewelry.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a case for my all of my makeup. I do not have a lot of makeup so this worked out perfectly.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this makeup case! Got me organized quickly and big enough to hold all of my stuff (no easy feat!)</li>
    <li> The makeup case showed up to my house on time, and exactly as described. The pink color is a match to what you see on the computer screen. It&#x27;s the perfect size for my makeup, and even comes with a lock and key for safe travels. It&#x27;s a great case!</li>
