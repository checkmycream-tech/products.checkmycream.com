      <li>bold)</li>
      <li>I was so pleased that I made my own from dried herbs burdock root, rosemary and helichrysum flower;</li>
      <li>You can leave it for at least 1 hr, or ideally overnight.</li>
      <li>Low price with nice size of oil.</li>
      <li>was right that in Russia they put they date of manufacture on the bottle and not the expiration date.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am Russian, and I am pretty sure my grandma used to use the burdock oil as well.</li>
      <li>so we know exactly what&#x27;s in it.    </li>
      <li>but I haven&#x27;t been able to use it regularly because every time Ive used it It makes my scalp very itchy for days.</li>
      <li>and you just need 2-4 drops to massage into scalp, even good to leave in overnight, wash your hair next morning with your regular shampoo and conditioner after.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pure burdock oil</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this is straight burdock oil....</li>
      <li>works fast and help a lot.</li>
      <li>it is very greasy</li>
      <li>but I haven&#x27;t really used it much.&lt;br /&gt;Ive</li>
      <li>/&gt;Thanks so much.</li>
      <li>It really works.  </li>
      <li>Once I have used it for about three months I will see the real results</li>
      <li>I was losing a lot of hair, way too much shedding</li>
      <li>This oil is very essencial if you want to make oil that will stimulate hair to grow.</li>
      <li>my hair stopped falling out as much</li>
      <li>and my bald spot regrew hair fast and lil by lil</li>
      <li>You see the eczema literally disappear everyday, and more importantly it stays away with regular use.</li>
      <li>This oil is not thick or greasy.</li>
      <li>I posted a before and after pictures both of my freshly washed hair with only burdock root oil applied.</li>
      <li>my doctor told me it was normal</li>
      <li>/&gt;Light massage of the head with a few drops of burdock oil will add a healthy shine (to your hair).&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
      <li>won&#x27;t use it again because that itching isn&#x27;t normal so its just not for me.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this product to those interested.</li>
      <li>I purchased this oil along with others as part of a natural hair care regimen.</li>
      <li>It immediately made my hair feel buttery soft.  </li>
      <li>it just takes time until it goes back to normal.</li>
      <li>I only use all natural products on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>2 Shampooings should do the trick of removing it.&lt;br /&gt;For intense treatment of dry hair you can use it every or every other day, otherwise once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
      <li>This is a good oil for growing hair, and it does not have a bad smell.</li>

<li> This is a good oil for growing hair, and it does not have a bad smell.</li>
<li> I will admit I applied it daily for about a month, my naturally dry hair thanked me, and MY HAIR FALL FINALLY STOPPED!  </li>
<li> ( last me a long time, I forgot what else I added).</li>
<li> I have only used it for only a few days, so far no complaints.</li>
<li> There is no strong smell and it is not in English words to read off the bottle, although they do put a little label on the bottle with a direct email and phone number if you want to contact the company or order directly from the company.</li>
<li> Obviously it takes a little longer to see results for hair</li>
<li> it appears to be diluted with Jojoba oil or some other carrier oil.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this for thinning hair and as an alternative to other lotions and creams for mine and my daughters eczema issues.</li>
<li> Also, I was reading from previous comments and one of the reviewers</li>
<li> I also noticed loosing less hair.&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
<li> As the label says, you can use a few drops to add shine to your hair.</li>
<li> Made my hair limp and lifeless looking.</li>
<li> and I poured some of the oil in a glass dropper and every morming I would put a few drops on my front corners and through out my scalp massauge and repeat every morimg</li>
<li> , in a few month it grew about 3-4 inches, and if I dont use oil, hair do not want to grow(:.</li>
<li> I have thin and very long hair, no dandruff or any scalp problems.</li>
<li> This oil is must have, at least for my family.</li>
<li> I was taking a supplement that seem to be working but slowly.  </li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for somebody with thin hair like me.</li>
<li> /&gt;There is no oil in the burdock root, and this is why it is a cold extract (into oil) from the burdock root, but it is commonly known in Russia as the burdock oil.</li>
<li> Its so weird.</li>
<li> Hello readers, Im very confused about this oil.</li>
<li> Very disappointing on this purchase.</li>
<li> My bad!</li>

    <li> Really is much better than many popular brands. Will buy again, it works!</li>
    <li> Burdock Oil is great  to use on your thinning hair, specially good to prevent hair loss, it moisturize dry scalp  and calm irritated, itchy skin, that is my personal expirience with this product. It&#x27;s pure burdock oil and you just need 2-4 drops to massage into scalp, even good to leave in overnight, wash your hair next morning with your regular shampoo and conditioner after. Twice a week doing this treatment will give you favorible results. I would recommend this products to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> Burdock oil isn&#x27;t easy to find, and we&#x27;re really happy with the quality and price of this oil.  It is from a Russian shop, so there are no English words on the bottle.  I don&#x27;t think this is straight burdock oil....it appears to be diluted with Jojoba oil or some other carrier oil.  Not that we&#x27;re complaining, as we&#x27;d mix it anyway, I just wish there were translations on the bottle so we know exactly what&#x27;s in it.    This stuff is working great on my mans scalp issues.  It greatly reduces itching.</li>
    <li> it is a nice hair mask and does strengthen your hair and rejuvenates it. very good for thinning and color treated hair. i do this treatment twice a week and get really good results.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product to those interested.</li>
    <li> works fast and help a lot., i would recommeded to all, i will but it again. but local pharmacy has cheaper price</li>
    <li> i starting using this product about 1 month ago and it took out my hair from the roots.  i used the one with nettle and one with pepper.  not recommended for everyone....</li>
    <li> Great pruduct. I see the difference in my hair growth. I also noticed loosing less hair.&lt;br /&gt;Since it is very greasy I mixed it with non fat yogurt and then apply to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again this product once I finish the current one.</li>
    <li> It may be a great product! I did not know what Burdock oil felt like! My bad!</li>
    <li> I recently had a baby and my hair was falling out I&#x27;m chunks it was horible my doctor told me it was normal and there&#x27;s no product pill shampoo thts going to stop my hair loss it just takes time until it goes back to normal. Well this product helped me so so the front corner of my hair line was balding I ordered this product and I poured some of the oil in a glass dropper and every morming I would put a few drops on my front corners and through out my scalp massauge and repeat every morimg I would wash my hair every 3 days or so and my bald spot regrew hair fast and lil by lil my hair stopped falling out as much it helped me so much good price for such a good product</li>
    <li> I am using it regularly, no big difference in hair appearance</li>
    <li> Made my hair limp and lifeless looking. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for somebody with thin hair like me. Very disappointing on this purchase.</li>
    <li> Hello readers, Im very confused about this oil. Maybe I could say it has helped my hair grow but I haven&#x27;t really used it much.&lt;br /&gt;Ive had the oil for a year but I haven&#x27;t been able to use it regularly because every time Ive used it It makes my scalp very itchy for days. Its so weird. I have never had itchy scalp in my life.&lt;br /&gt;Ive been trying to figure out why this happens. I have thin and very long hair, no dandruff or any scalp problems. I only use all natural products on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t use it again because that itching isn&#x27;t normal so its just not for me. I suggest you TRY IT YOURSELF, you might love it.</li>
    <li> I love burdock oil, it makes my hair stronger and silky. Also, I was reading from previous comments and one of the reviewers was right that in Russia they put they date of manufacture on the bottle and not the expiration date.</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil along with others as part of a natural hair care regimen. The label is in German so you will have to remember what you ordered. I purchased 4 bottles.</li>
    <li> very good oil. my hair is stronger!</li>
    <li> It arrived on time in great condition. Hair does look shiny and healthy. It seems that it prevents loss of hair. Yes, I would recomend this product.</li>
    <li> i like it. ordered not the 1 time. will do again.</li>
    <li> This is a good oil for growing hair, and it does not have a bad smell. I will buy this product again</li>
    <li> The product is very good and it arrived quickly and securely. The only issue I had is that everything is writtin in Russian. I wish it would have had some translation.</li>
    <li> This oil is very essencial if you want to make oil that will stimulate hair to grow. I add to this oil mint, jojoba, vit E, and one more component ( last me a long time, I forgot what else I added). One of my child had problem with hair growing, after I start use oil that I combine, (put plastic bag and warm hat on the head after applying oil), the hair finally became &amp;#34;alive&amp;#34; :), in a few month it grew about 3-4 inches, and if I dont use oil, hair do not want to grow(:. So, I will make another bunch, and do this only once a week. And when  I do this for my self, everyone notice the too healthy strong shine of my hair :). This oil is must have, at least for my family.</li>
    <li> I have heard great things about this oil for hair. I have only used it for only a few days, so far no complaints. Once I have used it for about three months I will see the real results but, I am very excited about this oil and happy to have it. The bottle came in secured package. There is no strong smell and it is not in English words to read off the bottle, although they do put a little label on the bottle with a direct email and phone number if you want to contact the company or order directly from the company.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it approx. (2) weeks and have not noticed any effect.  However, it would have been nice to receive directions in english.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> I received my bottle today and I am eager to see if it works... shipping was great I had it within a week. I will keep you posted on results...as soon as I figure out the directions :)</li>
    <li> This was another exceptional . Low price with nice size of oil. Great Value! Best value to be found around I know I looked all over!</li>
    <li> The best hair restorer I have ever found!!</li>
    <li> Burdock Oil - 100% extract from burdock root&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A well-known effective remedy, application of which aids in relieve of hair loss and formation of dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;Application of this oil strengthens hair, enhances its natural shine and beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Content: Oil extract of burdock root&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application:&lt;br /&gt;Light massage of the head with a few drops of burdock oil will add a healthy shine (to your hair).&lt;br /&gt;Easy to remove with a neutral shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;(In bold) Does not contain preservatives and synthetic additives. For external use only.&lt;br /&gt;Contraindication: individual allergies.&lt;br /&gt;Shelf life: 18 months&lt;br /&gt;Store at room temperature.&lt;br /&gt;Date of production:&lt;br /&gt;Volume 150ml&lt;br /&gt;Produced: Saint-Petersburg (Russia), Metalist Street 7&lt;br /&gt;etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Russian, and I am pretty sure my grandma used to use the burdock oil as well. It is a well known folk remedy for hair health, regrowth etc. As the label says, you can use a few drops to add shine to your hair. Also, as someone else mentioned already, I use about 1Tbsp for about 1 hour before I wash my hair to condition and strengthen the hair. Or you can leave it overnight (under a hat) for a deep treatment.&lt;br /&gt;There is no oil in the burdock root, and this is why it is a cold extract (into oil) from the burdock root, but it is commonly known in Russia as the burdock oil. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for thinning hair and as an alternative to other lotions and creams for mine and my daughters eczema issues. It&#x27;s perfect for both! Obviously it takes a little longer to see results for hair but it helped my follicles big time. And as for skin, I will never use anything else. You see the eczema literally disappear everyday, and more importantly it stays away with regular use.</li>
    <li> I make my own hair products and tried this oil as it is suppose to promote hair growth and it worked!</li>
    <li> Burdock oil has met greatly my expectations in every way! Told most of my friends about it and to try it! Thank you, Annemarie Conrod.</li>
    <li> This oil is not thick or greasy. It is a very light oil that dissolves quickly. I have heard good things about Burdock Oil but this brand is not 100%. Also the ingredients is not in English, so I am clueless what I am putting in my hair. I will not order again and hopefully I find a better quality Burdock oil that is more thicker and not runny like liquid. Also, the expired date says 12/2014 and it&#x27;s 2015.</li>
    <li> I am russian and am using Burdock oil for years now. The easiest way to apply it is to warm it a bit, apply onto roots and work it towards the ends. You can leave it for at least 1 hr, or ideally overnight. 2 Shampooings should do the trick of removing it.&lt;br /&gt;For intense treatment of dry hair you can use it every or every other day, otherwise once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;Hope it helps :)</li>
    <li> Helped my hairs and my daughters grow faster and stronger!!!! Love it!</li>
    <li> works well, just remember to use :) Comes on time, after some month continue to use</li>
    <li> It really works.  I am so ecstatic that I came across this oil.  I was losing a lot of hair, way too much shedding, My hair type is 3C; 4B.  I was taking a supplement that seem to be working but slowly.  Finally I tried this oil,  It immediately made my hair feel buttery soft.  I will admit I applied it daily for about a month, my naturally dry hair thanked me, and MY HAIR FALL FINALLY STOPPED!  I was so pleased that I made my own from dried herbs burdock root, rosemary and helichrysum flower; safflower oil infusion in my crock pot. When I don&#x27;t have time to make my own I would buy this product again. I am so grateful, thank you:) I posted a before and after pictures both of my freshly washed hair with only burdock root oil applied. only.</li>
