<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is favorite brand of lotion. I have been using it for years. Item arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Product came in really fast and lotion is great! It also tells you when it expires which is two years from now.  Very happy I bought this and I&#x27;ll sure be buying more</li>
    <li> This has honestly been a miracle lotion. The best part of all, I mostly use it for my face! I&#x27;ve been looking for a great moisturizer that isn&#x27;t jam pack with junk, but will also last a long time. With this I&#x27;m absolutely getting my moneys worth. Its a very good sized bottle, and little goes a long way! On the bottle, it says the lotion is fast absorbing, and I believe it! I can wear it under makeup and everything. Its been helping to detoxify my skin i&#x27;ve felt. At first it seemed like I was breaking out, but its just been the blemishes underneath my skin pushing on it (blackheads too!). After about a week or two my skin is on its way to the dewy pretty skin I&#x27;ve wanted for ages. I&#x27;ve gone through pretty much every other moisturizer/lotion on the planet, and i&#x27;m glad I never gave up or settled. This bottle is going to last at LEAST 3 months for my face. I&#x27;ve also been using it on my chest to kinda help pretty up so acne scars, and the texture of the skin there has been improving as well. This has honestly been a miracle. I have the most sensitive skin, and even baby mild products aren&#x27;t mild enough. This stuff is great! the smell isn&#x27;t at all atrocious on the senses either. It has a pretty mellow scent. I feel its kinda hard to have an issue with it. The scent I do smell, I feel is good. Who cares if it doesn&#x27;t smell like mangos? I just want it to work well! Overall, this product has just been perfect. All those little tiny blemishes (that aren&#x27;t even red, just tiny tiny bumps) have been going away. I&#x27;ve never seen my face so flat? :D</li>
    <li> I LOVE the Nubian Heritage Lotions. They are very thick &amp; creamy. I usually combine it with a lighter, more neutral smelling shea butter lotion (Palmer&#x27;s shea butter though it&#x27;s not \\&quot;all natural\\&quot;) to make it last a bit longer &amp; to tone down the fragrance. I love how this one smells but it&#x27;s a bit on the masculine side IMOO (in my olfactory opinion) so I purchased it for my notoriously ashy husband. He loves it (as well as the NH raw shea butter soap &amp; shower gel) but the lotion is too thick for him to throw on in a hurry so he adds water to thin it out. I think this stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great (kind of like sweet tobacco!).  I have horribly dry skin, esp. on my legs and this is the only lotion and soaks in but lasts!  It&#x27;s great for the whole body, even the face.  I also use this on my husband after I wax his eyebrows and he usually breaks out really bad after but not so much after I put this lotion on him!  I have tried a lot of lotions but you get the most bang for your buck with this stuff!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion because it does the same thing as the raw Shea butter except its in a lotion form. Smooths skin and helps remove marks. Make sure to order the 13 oz. Overall great product.</li>
    <li> Smooth to apply, and absorbs a little faster than raw shea butter dose.  Maintains a good portion of actual shea nutrients.  Great for perpetually dry skin and those with raynaud&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I love the scent and feel of this lotion. Although, on days where my skin is very dry(I live in a desert), I find it irritates my skin because of the fragrances. This is why I gave it 4 stars, because I wouldnt recommend it for people with very sensitive skin. The ingredients are natural, which I love. The consistancy is thick, creamy and absorbs well. I will definately buy more!</li>
    <li> I usually purchase this item locally but the price has increased about 50% and was quite happy to find that amazon sold this item and for less!! I quickly purchased a couple of bottles to tie me over for a few months in addition to the newly purchased bottle.  As soon as I used it I noticed something was different and when I checked the ingredients I noticed they changed them!! The consistency which used to be thick is so much thinner.  Also, the wonderful smell is nonexistent.  I instantly cancelled my order on Amazon (hopefully it goes through) but I had to write a review to let others who may come to the site looking to purchase this item for less.  If you can luck up and find one of the \\&quot;older\\&quot; bottles (which based on the picture it is not) then that&#x27;s great but I was not willing to take that chance. Some people may be ok with the change (why I gave it a 2) but if the two complaints I listed is why you liked the lotion, don&#x27;t BUY!</li>
    <li> could have been a really nice product. too bad it includes the ingredient Palm Oil, well known for over harvesting and contributing to the demise of natural habitat.</li>
    <li> I love the lotion, the smell and the natural ingredients.  The seller answered my questions promptly and was very helpful. I will definitely buy this and other Nubian Heritage products from this seller again. Great all around buying experience.</li>
    <li> Love everything Nubian Heritage makes! Top&lt;br /&gt;Of the line products that have quality ingredients&lt;br /&gt;And smell wonderful. This creme is thick, smells&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful. Goes on slightly greasy, but is quickly&lt;br /&gt;Absorbed just leaving your skin feeling soft,&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and less tight and dry.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin butter soft and smells great!  I&#x27;ve bought this 4 times since my 1st purchase!  Black men who shave, this is great to use as an aftershave!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion...I put it on and hours later my skin still feels great!  I even bought it for my 84 year old mom and she loves it as much as I do.  It&#x27;s thick so I had to squeeze it out in another jar for her because she doesn&#x27;t have the strength.... I just purchased another 3 bottles.... Love it!</li>
    <li> The scent is overwhelming. Smells like an Avon product. It  actually makes my eyes burn when I just apply to my hands. And the skin on my hands now feels irritated, much like when I touch dryer sheets or strong detergents.  Not good! I don&#x27;t know if the ingredient list really lists everything in this product, as I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to any of the recognizable ingredients before, and I&#x27;ve used most of the ingredients listed in their pure/straight form on my skin at one time or another&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is probably not good for people sensitive to smells. Even if it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin I&#x27;d be unable to use it due to the strong perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:( Ugh.  I&#x27;ll stick to straight macadamia nut oil and pure shea butter from now on. I wonder why I tried something new when I already have something that works great.</li>
    <li> 5 star for quality of product and really fast delivery. Lotion leaves skin smelling good, and it keeps skin soft and unirritated.. i have eczema, and this really feels nice. I have gotten compliments already on its scent.  Also, I use it with Aveeno daily moisturizer to keep the dryer spots from drying out fast.  Great overall; however, the bottle has to be left sideways or upside down because it is hard to squeeze out the lotion&#x27;s thick consistency. I would suggest a squirt top. Thank you!</li>
    <li> My hands get dry and cracked in the winter and this is the only non-greasy lotion that I can apply just once a day to get the job done.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this lotion six years ago while at a music festival in Newport Conn. I was very happy to find it on amizon because stores in NJ do not sell the product.</li>
    <li> This lotion is everything I wanted and more. First let me say that this lotion is thick (not thin or runny). This lotion is definitely very, very moisturizing. Once it is applied it does not leave a heavy feeling except a nice smooth finish. This lotion has a fresh scent and is not overpowering at all. It can be somewhat difficult to squeeze the lotion out of the bottle since it is a thick consistency but that can easily be fixed by keeping the bottle upside down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, it&#x27;s my favorite so I purchase it by the case.  Many of my friends have started ordering this product as well.</li>
    <li> I had to wake up in the middle of the night to rinse this off because the smell aggravated my nose.  I&#x27;m now taking allergy medicine.</li>
    <li> By far this has the best ingredients of anything I have used and I am sure over time it is great for your skin but the packaging is wrong.  It is more like a very fluffy creme and needs to be in a jar.  I am 64 and exercise every day and am at least a little strong for my age.  It is so thick and creamy that it does not flow out of the bottle.  It takes a lot of pushing and working with the thick cream in the bottle.  If it were packaged in a jar I would give it 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been trying to deal with the thickness of this lotion.  I read a review of this product on another site that said she added a little water to get it to come out easier.  I did and I am now raising my review to 5 stars</li>
    <li> This has a very unique smell but its amazing. Compliments every time i go out. Its amazing on your skin. Even on your face! :)</li>
    <li> I have tried other lotions and this is simply the best.  Been using this for quiet a while now.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and it&#x27;s not super greasy. The lotion is thick and it absorbs quickly. Would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The ingredients appear to be all natural and great.  The smell is not what I associate with a typical Cocoa Butter cream (to me it usually smells like chocolate).  The smell of this lotion is what I can best describe as clean and fresh:).  I personally prefer the smell of this bottle for me.  It is just a personal preference though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving a four instead of a five stars because the lotion doesn&#x27;t soak in as well as others.  That being said, I think I will continue to use this as my heavy moisturiser because the ingredients are all natural and I like the Nubian Heritage company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a side note, I am obssessed with their Olive Butter soap.  I think all of their soaps are amazing.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best scent I have personally ever smelled. The fragrance lasts on skin (and of course making it super smooth) for hours and hours. I usually get tired of the same smell after about 6 months - 1 yr but this I haven&#x27;t yet!! :D don&#x27;t foreseeing that I will in the future either... I&#x27;m anxious to try all Nubian Heritage products-- they are such good quality. Although they&#x27;re always coming out with new one, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to try them all, but I can still try...</li>
    <li> The raw shea lotion is an excellent product for hair, body and skin.  I love the smell its very light.</li>
    <li> NOTE:  THIS IS FOR THE NEW AND NOT IMPROVED VERSION.  The ingredients on the one I received is different from what is listed on the site.  The Raw Shea Butter w/o Frankincense and Myrrh is probably discontinued.  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous purchase was the one without the frankincense and myrrh.  That version was great on my face and body.  However, that version is gone from the marketplace.  I cannot find it anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I purchased this version thinking it was for the one pictured / described and it was Not.  What you will received is for the new formula.  This new version gives me horrible itchy rash!  I didn&#x27;t link my rash to this product right away as the rash slowly developed all over my forehead.  It even got infected and I was on antibiotics for 2 months.  The first doctor misdiagnosed me with shingles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a second opinion and they thought it was just an bacterial infection.  None of the meds worked.  The antibiotic stopped the rash from oozing out sandpaper like crusts but the rash was there and it looked bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rash came and went.  I was using a steroid cream that got rid of the rash.  But once I stopped using it, the rash came back with vengence.  After 3 months the rash went away.  I started using this lotion again and noticed my face getting itchy.  Thats when I finally found the cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even using it on my body, I would see small red dots developing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to dump this in the garbage.  I&#x27;m looking for the one without the extra ingredients.  Please let me know if you spot it.</li>
    <li> Nice feel, great smell. Loving it!!</li>
    <li> Love all Nubian Heritage products and this is definitely one of my favorite. The scent is almost masculine enough for a cologne but could still be used by either sex. Leaves my skin feelin great all day, no greasy residue or anything like that. It&#x27;s kinda thick though (more like a body butter than lotion) so it can be difficult squeezing it out the bottle once you get below half way.</li>
    <li> Nubian Heritage Raw Shea Butter is richest, most softening lotion I have ever used.  Obviously, it is loaded with shea butter.  I would prefer a little less fragrance, but I&#x27;ll continue to rank it best as is.  I shall try Nubian&#x27;s other products.</li>
    <li> Best raw shea butter lotion. Smells divine. Want the raw shea wash. Highly recommend!! Better than palmers shea butter lotion.</li>
    <li> Love the scent! I previously had used the body wash and was it delightful....decided to get the lotion which I have used in the past and love how thick and rich it is!</li>
    <li> I have eczema so my skin is very sensitive. I had tried everything I possibly could before I decided to try a product that was all natural. After alot of research I learned about the benefits of shea butter, cocoa butter, and vitamin E for the skin and began to look for an all natural product that contained all these ingredients. After stumbling upon Nubian Heritage Raw Shea Butter Lotion, I looked up every ingredient to make sure that it was all natural and it was. I gave it a try and it has been the best product I have ever used. I have the shower gel as well, which is all natural, and the combination of the two is phenomenal! The shower gel makes your skin soooooooooo soft and then the lotion works best right after the shower. I only have to use the lotion once a day except for my hands. Its non-greasy and leaves your skin looking great! I highly recommend this product to anyone with/without sensitive skin. The smell is wonderful as well! I recommend getting the 13oz. bottle because it has a better value!!!</li>
    <li> I am always looking for products with raw shea butter for my skin, I have psoriasis and have several prescription lotions to manage my condition.  Unfortunately for the prescription lotion, the remedy is short lived.  After months of use, the medicine becomes ineffective.  So another prescription is added to my regime and this keeps going on and on until you come to the conclusion that there is simply no cure.  I have also used shea butter but oftentimes what I find are heavily perfumed and / or simply raw.  The Nubian product - both body wash and lotion are very creamy and smooth.  It has helped me tremendously in keeping my skin moist and outbreak free.  I have lessened my prescription use to simply the Nubian Heritage products - body wash &amp; lotion.  I have shared my experience with my dermatologist who I see regularly in managing my condition and she has added both products to recommend for her other patients. I can never have enough of this product and keep my shelves well stocked.  The list of prescription lotions and my dependency on them have slowly diminished.  YAY!!!!!</li>
    <li> The smell is quite overwhelming and it smells very artificial too. I&#x27;d expect &amp;#34;a raw shea butter lotion&amp;#34; to smell something light and natural. But this is just a heavy lotion, made from a mixture of oils, shea butter and some heavy perfumes. The other thing is the packaging - it is nothing what it looks like in the picture. Mine came in a bottle (like a shampoo bottle), which is more difficult to dispense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only had the lotion on my hands for a few minutes and my eyes are tearing up, can&#x27;t imagine applying this before bed..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a disappointment...</li>
    <li> Love your product, leaves my skin so soft.  I have supreme dry itchy skin and this lotion works great for me!! Also smells so good, everyone comments on the great smell. My daughter-in- law has also starting using it!!</li>
    <li> This lotion is a great product and I keep ordering it and giving it as gifts to friends and family. It smells so good and absorbs so well into your skin. I use it several times a day on my hands and many times on my feet. When the kids were red from too much sun they used it and it was very soothing. I really can&#x27;t say enough about this great lotion.</li>
    <li> The fragrance of this lotion isn&#x27;t quite as pleasant as the Raw Shea Butter in Frankincense and Myrrh, but it&#x27;s still nice.</li>
    <li> Typically I&#x27;m a big fan of Nubian products, but the scent of the Nubian Heritage Lotion, Raw Shea and Myrrh is overpowering. The first time I tried it out my husband asked, &amp;#34;what is that awful smell?&amp;#34; Though the lotion made my skin feel very soft, the smell is nauseating.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for over three years. By far, the best lotion I have used. Feels great on my skin.</li>
    <li> Very nice feel and fragrance.</li>
    <li> The picture is incorrect- but it&#x27;s the same 13oz. squeeze bottle of Nubian lotion I have loved for years.  The scent is wonderful, and I use it daily as a moisturizer my after shower. It&#x27;s light and not greasy, absorbs quickly, and is aluminum and paraben free.</li>
    <li> This was a gift.  The person was already using this product.</li>
    <li> Trust you are using an all natural product that is good for your skin and smells amazing!  With totally order this again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this before but not from Amazon, and the scent/aroma was much more pronounced and richer in those previous purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said - the quality and feel on my skin of this lotion from Amazon is comparable to the other bottles I&#x27;ve purchased in the past from the other vendor.  But - I still prefer that &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; and captivating scent that caused me to love this product  - so I&#x27;ll regretfully be reverting to the other vendor, though it is more expensive there!</li>
    <li> really light moisturizer with no nasty chemicals or additives, I use it on my toddler and myself - even as a face cream</li>
    <li> love the texture of this lotion - if you like thick / creamy lotions, this is a winner.  Feels rich and indulgent</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to replenish supply purchased from a store about 2.5 hrs away.  The product purchased from the store was wonderful, great consistency and smell.  The product ordered from this site had an awful medicinal smell...almost made me gag and nothing like my original even though labeled to be the same.  I was very disappointed and will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  Smells so good without being overpowering and very softening and soothing...  love it.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It&#x27;s made a huge difference in the texture and appearance of my skin. It&#x27;s so much softer and younger-looking, and the dark ankles and elbows I&#x27;ve struggled to get rid of all my life have disappeared. It&#x27;s very thick but not at all greasy and has a really nice, light scent. I&#x27;ve purchased it for friends and family members and have yet to find anyone who&#x27;s tried it and doesn&#x27;t love it. I wish I had found this lotion years ago. Buy it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my third container of this really great hand cream.  Will probably be giving this product to friends at Christmas . Please keep on making it.</li>
    <li> This is one of my very favorite products!  This lotion feels so good on the skin, and it smells heavenly too!  It is thick and rich and a little goes a long way.  It feels like it is actually doing something good for your skin, rather than just sitting there smelling nice for a few minutes, like so many other lotions I have tried.</li>
    <li> Have always loved the Raw Shea and Myrrh.  Awesome fragrance.  And this 13 oz. size is great!!</li>
    <li> This lotion leaves the skin really moisturize when used with the shea butter body wash. The smell of the lotion is really nice and I&#x27;m a male too. So any males or females having any doubts about this lotion, give it a try and you will see what I&#x27;m talking about. I have to admit that it is a thick lotion and a little bit will do you just fine.</li>
    <li> This lotion is thick, but absorbs fairly quickly. The smell is wonderful! It&#x27;s a subtle, warm, natural scent that comes from essential oils and natural extracts, not fake perfumes. The ingredients are all natural and high quality. I also love the Coconut Papaya lotion by Nubian Heritage (so far, I haven&#x27;t found a product of theirs I don&#x27;t like!), but that is such a summery scent and this one is perfect for fall. As for the moisturizing properties of this product, it can&#x27;t be beat. My skin looks, feels and smells wonderful -- what&#x27;s not to like? This product is a little pricey, but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  My skin is so soft from it.</li>
    <li> Perfect lotion for a year round glow. The fragrance is amazing.</li>
    <li> I just got this lotion, and it&#x27;s good for healing skin, and I have dry skin, and it feels wonderful on my skin.  This is a great lotion!!</li>
    <li> Pretty much the best moisturizer ever, leaves a nice scent all day, and prevents a shaving rash when I use it regularly.</li>
    <li> this stuff was so bad for me!  i have never needed a shower after applying lotion before!  it burned and burned and burned some more.  i put this on my face and it made my face break out with those really big pimples that are under the surface.  you know the kind, they hurt really bad whenever something touches them.  it may be perfect for someone else but it is not the lotion for me!</li>
    <li> Natural ingredients and water isn&#x27;t the primary one which is great, but that may be why its so thick.  Needs a tub - can&#x27;t imagine a \\&quot;little old lady\\&quot; squeezing the stuff out.  Would also apply better if thinner.  Not oily.  3.5 stars</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  It&#x27;s thick and smells very good.  I received the body lotion (as expected), not the hand lotion that is in the picture.</li>
    <li> Lovely scent but really really thick.  It&#x27;s hard to get out of the bottle.  I&#x27;ve managed to get some out so that i can use it.  It won&#x27;t pour or squeeze out like most lotions.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Works well.</li>
    <li> Sweet, the smells and textures and way it makes me feel...pure sensual healing for your skin. I buy it in the largest bottles they make, 4 at a time. I will never tire of this lotion. Of all the Nubian body lotions, this is my favorite with raw shea butter and lemongrass as my second and third.</li>
    <li> You must try this lotion. It smells good and will leave your skin glowing. It seems edible. If you are a bride, then surely you want to place this on your skin on your wedding day and more.</li>
    <li> Did not moisturize and was very thick. I loved the smell, but I&#x27;m very dry and it did nothing for me wish I didn&#x27;t waste my money.</li>
    <li> I used to buy Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s but discovered it wasn&#x27;t exactly all natural. I spotted this at whole foods body and bought it. It&#x27;s honestly the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. My only complaints is they don&#x27;t make bigger bottles.</li>
    <li> Yes. I am 67 and on the prowl for the fountain of youth :)  I have tried Nerium, it has a significant tightening action, at least temporarily. I have also tried Xoçai Xophoria (with natural cacao). I liked the Xoçai better, BUT both are quite pricey. I always wind up adding, or reverting to my standby: &amp;#34;Nubian Heritage Raw Shea Butter, with soy milk, vitamin E, Frankincense  &amp; myrrh&amp;#34;.This budget friendly product has actually added density to my thinning skin and removed the emerging spider veins from my cleavage.  I use it on my whole body,  not just my face; it makes my extremely dry, aging skin comfortable for the day. My HS students think I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s until they discover I have a 46 yr old daughter!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the nicest lotion you will ever see.  I have very sensitive skin and even expensive lotion is caustic to me.  This stuff is wonderfully scented and soothing.  The best lotion deal there.  Thanks, Nubian Heritage, you rock.</li>
    <li> This is excellent lotion for black skin</li>
    <li> I started using this when I was pregnant to keep from getting stretch marks. I continue to use it two years later because my skin is SO soft. I also use it on my son&#x27;s eczema.</li>
    <li> This lotion is some of the best I have used! It goes on very smooth and has a wonderful smell. My hands get really dry in the North Dakota winter and when I ran out if this lotion and tried another product, it did not compare. I purchased another bottle of this lotion and my hands are once again happy.</li>
    <li> Great product and great value for the larger product size.  Much cheaper than the web retailer I used to use!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I work in healthcare and the harsh soap at my workplace is extremely drying. I use this after washing my hands and I&#x27;m good to go. I use this product on a daily basis-- After I shower or whenever I just want softer skin. It is thick, which I love. You can definitely smell the shea butter! Some people don&#x27;t like the smell of shea butter, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. The ingredients are fantastic and I definitely recommend it. I will be repurchasing this lotion once I run out!  UPDATE: I have been using this product for a little over three months now and I&#x27;m still loving it! The bottle is halfway empty and the lotion is very difficult to squeeze out of the bottle, which is my only complaint.</li>
    <li> absolutely love all of their lotions and products. Extremely high quality and very good value for the money</li>
    <li> I bought this along with the cream and was not disappointed. It also nourishes the skin and leaves the same scent as the soap.</li>
    <li> I gave it only 4 stars as the &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; is too thick and doesn&#x27;t come out easily. give me a good arm exercise every time I try to use it.</li>
    <li> Great lotion.  Super thick and can be hard to get out of the bottle.  Beautiful scent.  Can feel a bit greasy, but not a slippery kind of greasy, just not absorbed kind of feel.  But because of that, it is a very heavy moisturizer and works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for many years now. If I&#x27;m not using Nubian Heritage Lotion I just use shea butter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time. It&#x27;s moisturizing, not greasy.  I use it often, even on my face.</li>
    <li> I found out about this product when searching the internet for “organic lotion”. The linked led me directly to Amazon where I read all of the comments about the product. None of them were bad and since I have sensitive skin I figured I would give at least one bottle a chance. The price scared me but after using it – I found that you do not require as much of it compared to conventional lotions. It smells great keeps my skin moist all day and I have no concerns about toxic chemicals entering my body! This company has made a true fan out of me - I use their soap, lotion, and the raw shea butter as a facial moisturizer!!! It is worth the price!!</li>
    <li> I order these products and I am hooked. I love this scent very much, it&#x27;s subtle and not over powering.</li>
    <li> This lotion is THICK and CREAMY and SMOOTH and LOVELY and PERFECT!  Just what I was looking for to soothe my itchy winter skin.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Love the scent and how it is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> This lotion is like heavenly magic! It is sooo moisturizing and rich and yet my skin soaks it up like crazy. It smells heavenly. I have a sensitive nose and can&#x27;t stand over powering or cheap scents. This has a very nice soft scent and smells even better once it&#x27;s warmed on your skin for a while.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in LOVE and devoted to Nubian products.  I first fell for the Coconut Mango Body wash, then the lotion and now I&#x27;m two timing with the intoxicating Frankincense and Myrrh scented Shea Butter formula.  It&#x27;s an aphrodisiac for my lover and my friends love it too.  Nubian Heritage is something I just can&#x27;t live without.</li>
    <li> I always purchase this lotion. Great for my DRY skin in the winter time. It is thick and has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I love to lotion, makes my skin shiny without lookin oilly. I have used it for 2 weeks and I&#x27;m still loving it so far^_^</li>
    <li> Nubian Heritage Raw Shea Butter Lotion is a great product.  I have used it for over a year.  My skin is considerably softer, brighter, and smoother.  This lotion leaves my skin looking very healthy and youthful.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The consistency is amazing, BUT.... the smell is so overpowering there is no way I could wear this. I&#x27;m not kidding when I say that people could smell you a mile away. The scent isn&#x27;t awful, there is just way way too much of it.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic. I&#x27;ve just put it on my body and I&#x27;m going to put it again this evening after I take my bath. It&#x27;s incredible! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my skin and face unbelievably soft, and the smell is amazing.  As other reviewers have mentioned, it sometimes takes a little extra time to get the product out of the container, but I can definitely deal with the minor inconvenience.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this lotion and it makes my skin feel wonderful without being oily.</li>
    <li> I love the scent and will definitely re-order</li>
    <li> I was happy to find real Shea butter that was easier to apply.  It works for me and feels good on my skin.  I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> very moisturizing, but lotion it&#x27;s a bit too thick and it&#x27;s hard to get everything out of the bottle</li>
    <li> The scent is fabulous and my skin has never felt so soft. I pair it with the body wash, and really just with the wash you wouldn&#x27;t need the lotion. But use both and your skin will feel divine.</li>
    <li> muy humectante! y el efecto dura mucho tiempo y el olor es tambien muy agradable. Al ser bien espesa no tienes que ponerte mucha asi que dura mucho.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s one of my favorite lotions, thick, rich and absorbs well into the skin. I bought it for my daughter, who said she misses the scent when I am not around.</li>
    <li> Very, very Happy w/ this product.  Thick, rich,  subtle scent and does make my  ( over 50 ) skin soft.  Now,  my skin, fortunately, is pretty soft &amp; smooth,  and this product makes it even softer &amp; the results last .  I put some on earlier,  and after touching my arm realizing I could still feel the benefits.  So i decided to write a review.  i would order this lotion again.  Happy Touching ;)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this lotion. I use it even as a face cream!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion.  It is hard to get out of the bottle, but well worth it.  I wish I had many more bottles of this as I&#x27;m sure it will run out sooner than expected as my skin really soaks it up.  Sometimes I add a little coconut oil to it for thinning and to moisturize even more.</li>
    <li> This lotion is AMAZING.  And the fact that it&#x27;s all natural and smells good?  I&#x27;ll be using it forever!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good,feels so silky on skin.I plan on buying 2 more bottles for my sisters,i am hooked.</li>
    <li> Keeps your skin soft and moist</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite lotions. My son&#x27;s, too! It&#x27;s great for the skin and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It absorbs well, and smells great, however it&#x27;s scent is a little strong.  I don&#x27;t wear perfume when I&#x27;ve applied this lotion. I would give it a 5 star except for the strong scent.</li>
    <li> I am a long time user of this brand and product  .My skin feels smooth all day long without looking or feeling oily. A wonderful product!</li>
