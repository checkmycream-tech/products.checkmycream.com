      <li>It certainly is a great shape for my purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Bottom line: this is a great product, but don&#x27;t be expecting all natural if you buy this one</li>
      <li>the shape was very easy to hold though.  </li>
      <li>The stone itself is very light</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use and ever so effective at removing calluses and cracks in the heel area.</li>
      <li>I love this pumice stone.</li>
      <li>I go barefoot most of the time, so</li>
      <li>It gets the job done, but i have had better.</li>
      <li>We love, love, love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I ordered it.</li>
      <li>It has a lovely irregular but pleasing shape and gets the job done.</li>
      <li>Very quickly grows mold.</li>
      <li>Works wonderfully, easy to hold, keeps well.</li>
      <li>For the first time in ages I have nice, smooth feet.  </li>
      <li>This stone is the perfect size and the round, irregular shape makes it easy for anyone to hold regardless of the size of their hands.</li>
      <li>I use it for callus on the feet, it is not real rough, but the price was good, and it does work ok.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use soak ur feet in hot water</li>
      <li>It really works and, it really works great.</li>
      <li>used this stone right before getting out of the shower every day and that was it!</li>
      <li>Its nice to have a natural product to use.  </li>
      <li>&amp;#34;The stone is better to be more flat!&#x27;</li>
      <li>I use this thing every few bathings and it is great.  </li>
      <li>It is most definitely natural, no perfume or smell.</li>
      <li>The martial sine works better than any synthetic tool I have ever tried to use on my heel calluses.</li>
      <li>This stone was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d really rather smaller, but I&#x27;m happy to have it just the same.</li>
      <li>But it was evident that this one was lab created because it had a prefumy sort of fragrance.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sooooooooo much better than a regular foot scrubby stick for feet that you&#x27;d get at K-mart, for example!</li>
      <li>Took a chance on this pumice stone thanks to the reviews and it has paid off.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a diabetic and this is a gentle pumice stone which does not crumble nor scratch.  </li>
      <li>And I always wet it before each use and rinsed it after each use.&lt;br /&gt;Much better than the pumice stone</li>
      <li>It works real well.</li>
      <li>I only use it for light exfoliation.</li>
      <li>My mom has a real one</li>
      <li>highly recommend this stone!</li>
      <li>And my feet never reached baby smooth stage even though I used it daily for over 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>It is important to thoroughly soak your feet in order for the stone to work properly.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>Since this kind of stone is made from lava I expected that it wouldn&#x27;t have any more scent than any ordinary rock would.</li>
      <li>I use this pumice stone in between my pedicures, it works great at removing dead skin with little to no effort and leaves my feet feeling soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I have never been able to find another similar quality natural pumice stone till now, although after purchasing this one I noticed natural stones in the health food store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for soft, smooth feet, elbows, etc., look no further!!</li>
      <li>This is real pumice stone, and a really LARGE one, at that, shipped quickly and reasonably for the same price I used to pay for the smaller oval stones.  </li>
      <li>i felt it could be less smooth to really do the job.  </li>
      <li>Prefer two smaller ones, this is very large.</li>
      <li>I have a great distaste for artificial pumice stones because the pores are often too closely spaced in a predetermined pattern.</li>
      <li>I now have baby soft feet</li>
      <li>Was somewhat dubious that they really were individual.</li>
      <li>The size varies from stone to stone since it is a natural product.  </li>
      <li>my feet are usually rough, but this stone does the job just right without tearing my feet up.  </li>
      <li>Not too hard, not too soft, just right!!</li>
      <li>This one is actually pretty heavy and very dense for a pumice stone.</li>
      <li>There is some crumbling but you would barely notice it.</li>
      <li>I much prefer using a pumice stone over a Ped Egg or other product that has blades on it.  </li>

<li> I much prefer using a pumice stone over a Ped Egg or other product that has blades on it.  </li>
<li> It works very well at removing dead skin from extremely chapped skin after a considerable soak in a bath.  </li>
<li> I was not thrilled with this when I first bought it.</li>
<li> This stone looks like it&#x27;s going to last a very long time.</li>
<li> This is not a real natural pumice stone.</li>
<li> I use this for cleaning water scale build up in my toilet.</li>
<li> This stone is not abrasive enough for somewhat calloused feet or very dry skin.  </li>
<li> I lift weights, jog, and my job is also very hands-on, so I get all kinds of wonky callouses and rough patches of skin on both my hands and feet.</li>
<li> I use mine dry even though everybody says to use it wet.</li>
<li> It is the size of my closed fist.</li>
<li> This is a simple pumice stone used for removing dead skin on feet.  </li>
<li> This will not openly cut your skin but, again, if you are pushing too hard, if you fail to soak long enough, or if your feet are already fairly soft, this may be a bit rough and cause some irritation similar to a scrape or a rug burn.  </li>
<li> My feet felt softer and smoother than they had with any other lotion or pumice stone.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
<li> So, if you&#x27;re looking to fake out a young person... look no further!</li>
<li> Mine is about 3 inches long by 1.5 inches wide and .75in thick.  </li>
<li> and it&#x27;s down to almost nothing.</li>
<li> and when you&#x27;re trying to scrape the callus of a neanderthal off your foot, your need something heavy duty.</li>
<li> , I bought a few months ago;[[ASIN</li>
<li> If you do not soak them long enough or if you push too hard with the pumice stone you might end up scraping your feet causing an unpleasant situation, so be careful.  </li>
<li> The shape is a little hard to use compared with the stones mounted to a handle but otherwise works well.</li>
<li> It does not get icky or moldy and can be washed and dried as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I usually buy pumice stones locally and they&#x27;re preformed and basically useless after a couple of uses.  </li>
<li> Lost the one I had and this was hard to find.</li>
<li> This stone was meant to replace my Dr. Scholl&#x27;s brand pumice that I misplaced when i moved and it wasn&#x27;t as tough.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s also rough which I needed desperately.</li>
<li> They&#x27;re usually small and difficult to hold</li>
<li> So it&#x27;s a little awkward to use,</li>
<li> /&gt;While it would be hard to get this product wrong, it&#x27;s not mass produced in china, and does as advertised.</li>
<li> I like the stone a lot, but it was packed poorly and part of it broke off.</li>

    <li> &amp;#34;The stone is better to be more flat!&#x27;</li>
    <li> I use this thing every few bathings and it is great.  Its nice to have a natural product to use.  It does discolor, but otherwise no issues.</li>
    <li> Not too hard, not too soft, just right!! I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but it&#x27;s perfect for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t scratch at all, but gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect pumice.</li>
    <li> I have a pumice stone I&#x27;ve had for years and it&#x27;s down to almost nothing. I have never been able to find another similar quality natural pumice stone till now, although after purchasing this one I noticed natural stones in the health food store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this. It is most definitely natural, no perfume or smell. I use mine dry even though everybody says to use it wet. It does not get icky or moldy and can be washed and dried as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not prepared for how gigantic this thing is. It is the size of my closed fist. I could not possibly close my fist around it. So it&#x27;s a little awkward to use, I&#x27;d really rather smaller, but I&#x27;m happy to have it just the same.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing rock. Truly.</li>
    <li> I use it for callus on the feet, it is not real rough, but the price was good, and it does work ok.</li>
    <li> I had never used a pumice stone before my buying it through amazon. The experience was quite different than I anticipated. Since this kind of stone is made from lava I expected that it wouldn&#x27;t have any more scent than any ordinary rock would. But it was evident that this one was lab created because it had a prefumy sort of fragrance. Still a good product and it still did the job. It certainly is a great shape for my purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Bottom line: this is a great product, but don&#x27;t be expecting all natural if you buy this one***</li>
    <li> I was very happy to get a real, natural pumice stone, just like the ones I remember my mom having.</li>
    <li> Lost the one I had and this was hard to find. Prefer two smaller ones, this is very large. I guess I can cut it into 2 pieces haven&#x27;t checked that out yet and is a great product either way.</li>
    <li> This stone looks like it&#x27;s going to last a very long time. Yay! It&#x27;s so easy to use and ever so effective at removing calluses and cracks in the heel area. Good price too.</li>
    <li> I use this pumice stone in between my pedicures, it works great at removing dead skin with little to no effort and leaves my feet feeling soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I like the stone a lot, but it was packed poorly and part of it broke off.</li>
    <li> I love this pumice stone. It has a lovely irregular but pleasing shape and gets the job done. I&#x27;m glad I ordered it.</li>
    <li> This is not a real natural pumice stone. My mom has a real one so I can tell the difference. This one is actually pretty heavy and very dense for a pumice stone. It does get the job done though.</li>
    <li> I was not thrilled with this when I first bought it. It felt like a rock on my feet. How was this going to do anything? I was planning to give it only a star but something changed my mind. My feet felt softer and smoother than they had with any other lotion or pumice stone.&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a keeper!</li>
    <li> Real volcanic pumice,will best used for scrubbing feet soles</li>
    <li> I lift weights, jog, and my job is also very hands-on, so I get all kinds of wonky callouses and rough patches of skin on both my hands and feet. This is great for smoothing them over.</li>
    <li> Very effective product ... If used regularly ... Scrubbed it almost every day ... Very easy to use soak ur feet in hot water n then rigorously rub ur feet with the stone ... If u suffer from calluses</li>
    <li> Oh man! This thing is amazing. We love, love, love it. It really works and, it really works great. It&#x27;s sooooooooo much better than a regular foot scrubby stick for feet that you&#x27;d get at K-mart, for example! Those things fall apart and get gross after awhile, but not the pumice! It&#x27;s a solid rock- and it rock&#x27;s...</li>
    <li> This is a simple pumice stone used for removing dead skin on feet.  The stone itself is very light weight- about 3 oz as the description states.  The size varies from stone to stone since it is a natural product.  Mine is about 3 inches long by 1.5 inches wide and .75in thick.  It works very well at removing dead skin from extremely chapped skin after a considerable soak in a bath.  It is important to thoroughly soak your feet in order for the stone to work properly.  If you do not soak them long enough or if you push too hard with the pumice stone you might end up scraping your feet causing an unpleasant situation, so be careful.  I would not recommend using this on feet that are already considerably soft as I feel it would be too rough.  I much prefer using a pumice stone over a Ped Egg or other product that has blades on it.  This will not openly cut your skin but, again, if you are pushing too hard, if you fail to soak long enough, or if your feet are already fairly soft, this may be a bit rough and cause some irritation similar to a scrape or a rug burn.  Overall, it&#x27;s a simple pumice with no bells or whistles.</li>
    <li> This stone was meant to replace my Dr. Scholl&#x27;s brand pumice that I misplaced when i moved and it wasn&#x27;t as tough.  i felt it could be less smooth to really do the job.  the shape was very easy to hold though.  It gets the job done, but i have had better.</li>
    <li> This stone is not abrasive enough for somewhat calloused feet or very dry skin.  I only use it for light exfoliation.</li>
    <li> Took a chance on this pumice stone thanks to the reviews and it has paid off. I now have baby soft feet and it took no effort. I didn&#x27;t even have to scrub hard.&lt;br /&gt;Just used this stone right before getting out of the shower every day and that was it! And I always wet it before each use and rinsed it after each use.&lt;br /&gt;Much better than the pumice stone, I bought a few months ago;[[ASIN:B003O9DJD4 CUCCIO NATURALE Earth Stone Lava Pumice]] which wasn&#x27;t even usuable on one side. And my feet never reached baby smooth stage even though I used it daily for over 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;This pumice stone achieved baby smoothness in only a week.</li>
    <li> Was somewhat dubious that they really were individual. However I bought 2 and both were different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it would be hard to get this product wrong, it&#x27;s not mass produced in china, and does as advertised.</li>
    <li> This stone was exactly what I was looking for.  The martial sine works better than any synthetic tool I have ever tried to use on my heel calluses. I have been in sandles all summer with beautiful feet! Without having to pay for a pedicure!</li>
    <li> The shape is a little hard to use compared with the stones mounted to a handle but otherwise works well.</li>
    <li> This is real pumice stone, and a really LARGE one, at that, shipped quickly and reasonably for the same price I used to pay for the smaller oval stones.  Very happy!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a child and I told him it was a rock from the moon.  It totally looks like it!  The color is the same as the photo and there&#x27;s no string or anything that makes it look like a callus removal tool.  So, if you&#x27;re looking to fake out a young person... look no further!</li>
    <li> Very quickly grows mold.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for soft, smooth feet, elbows, etc., look no further!! I have a great distaste for artificial pumice stones because the pores are often too closely spaced in a predetermined pattern. They&#x27;re usually small and difficult to hold and when you&#x27;re trying to scrape the callus of a neanderthal off your foot, your need something heavy duty. This stone is the perfect size and the round, irregular shape makes it easy for anyone to hold regardless of the size of their hands. It&#x27;s also rough which I needed desperately. There is some crumbling but you would barely notice it. I bought some callus softener to go with it and I haven&#x27;t even used it since the stone works so well on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this stone!</li>
    <li> I usually buy pumice stones locally and they&#x27;re preformed and basically useless after a couple of uses.  This stone is great and I love it.  I go barefoot most of the time, so my feet are usually rough, but this stone does the job just right without tearing my feet up.  For the first time in ages I have nice, smooth feet.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
