      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>I liked the one I received.</li>
      <li>it seems to tip over very easy</li>
      <li>and they keep the bottles at the right angle so you can get the right amount of polish needed to do a perfect manicure.</li>
      <li>The is so pliable that it will hug most bottle sizes.</li>
      <li>and I love it</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t do nail art, but I&#x27;m sure these will work to your satisfaction.</li>
      <li>I going to order more because I just leave the polish in the holder when I’m done with my nails.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
      <li>I would, for sure, recommend this to anyone that has problems hold the polish bottle while doing nails.</li>
      <li>I sure like this because I don&#x60;t have to hold it alone and its easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
      <li>Love these.  </li>
      <li>They hold my nail polish and/or top coat without any spillage.</li>
      <li>Makes hand free application really nice.  </li>
      <li>I am a manicurist and it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work with most bottles I have.</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>and I use a lot of OPI polish and don&#x27;t have a problem fitting these in like</li>
      <li>Gives a great angle to get the drops at the very bottom.</li>
      <li>They are super useful and really a great deal</li>
      <li>The one I did receive works pretty good.</li>
      <li>Otherwise,  a pretty good product.</li>
      <li>This nail polish holder is perfect and about 1/4 of the price of other ones I have seen advertised and on top of that you get 2 of them.  </li>
      <li>Will fit most nail polish bottles.</li>
      <li>so you can get to the polish easily.</li>
      <li>but they work great especially if you need to work with more than one colour</li>
      <li>These rubber stands have an awfully strong chemical smell.</li>
      <li>It makes painting my nails fun and easy!</li>
      <li>The best part is the nail polish can lean sideways when it is not full.</li>
      <li>These little holders work great!  </li>
      <li>Thinking since the holder is so pliable it may fit any bottle</li>
      <li>They will fit almost any size bottle in a sturdy fashion.</li>
      <li>I would say these would fit just about any polish out there except for Butter London polish being square shape.</li>
      <li>I enjoy giving these as gifts to my family and friend&#x27;s children.</li>
      <li>OPI and China Glaze don&#x27;t fit as comfortably as I would have hoped.</li>
      <li>These really come in handy.  </li>
      <li>Your hands are free.</li>
      <li>Hands free working zone.</li>
      <li>They fit but there is no bend to get the bottom polish.</li>
      <li>and although they do fit inside the holder I had to stretch the holder to get it in.</li>
      <li>but they fit the bottles and stayed put on my table and did not slide at all</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s look so nice and comfortable thanks for the product</li>
      <li>This item is very useful</li>
      <li>As you let go, the bottle returns to its original position without spilling.  </li>
      <li>It was worth trying, for the price!</li>
      <li>Some bottles tilt and stay tilted better than others, but it really doesn&#x27;t matter.  </li>
      <li>The soft plastic material that this holder is made from is nice.  </li>
      <li>polish bottles don&#x27;t fit right in these so that they bend to use the bottom part</li>
      <li>I like my bottle holders, fits most nailpolish bottles, I will purchase more in the future, it toke for ever to come</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m definitely buying more!</li>
      <li>I say almost because I do have some large square that didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
      <li>Thanks for sending my package so fast it came before the estimate time I love it</li>
      <li>Works excellent when the bottle is almost empty and you need to angle the bottle to get the last bit of polish out.</li>
      <li>Rarely fits the nail lacquer</li>
      <li>However, it stretches out nicely and hold bigger polish bottles like OPI.</li>
      <li>This product is easy to mold to your particular nail polish bottle.</li>
      <li>They are made from a really flexible rubber so not only do they conform to most nail polish bottles, they tend to stay put on a table top</li>
      <li>Well worth the wait.</li>
      <li>For $2.06 it was worth the try.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it holds my nail polish great and i gave the  other to my mother in law</li>
    <li> Thanks for sending my package so fast it came before the estimate time I love it I already use it and I love it it&#x27;s look so nice and comfortable thanks for the product and I will continue buy with you</li>
    <li> This item is very useful I like it.</li>
    <li> Not well made, very small, could not fit gel colors in them</li>
    <li> Perfect!! Fit all of my nail polish bottles and extremely durable would recommend !</li>
    <li> These really come in handy.  But I&#x27;m worried they will start cracking because my polish bottles stretch them out. Time will tell.</li>
    <li> Does not fit all of my daughters polishes</li>
    <li> Still waiting for the other one. The 2 piece came with only one. Really?</li>
    <li> Highly recommended, I like it. Received 01/22/2015H</li>
    <li> Looks good! It&#x27;s molded out of one piece of silicon and seems very stable. Holds the bottle nicely, but not sure about a square bottle. Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Gave these as a gift to friends that do their nails all the time.  I did not try it, but they said it works really well</li>
    <li> Just as expected! Good price. Be patient. It takes a long time to get here !</li>
    <li> I just received my order today. I&#x27;m not happy! Waited so long to finally get this &amp; I was only sent 1 of the holders instead of 2. As far as how they work, they do the job. For square bottles like Essie, you can bend the rubber to make it work. Not a perfect fit but it will still hold the bottle well. I contacted the seller so hopefully I will be sent the other one in another month!! I wont order from this place again that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> This holds the fingernail polish bottle at a perfect angle.  It&#x27;s heavy enough so that it doesn&#x27;t move when dipping the brush and wiping it on the inside of the bottle.  It arrived in a timely manner</li>
    <li> Bought these as a gift for my mom and she loves them! I tried them also but they just don&#x27;t work for me. They will fit almost any size bottle in a sturdy fashion. I say almost because I do have some large square that didn&#x27;t fit. (Sally Hansen Sugar Coat)  Otherwise,  a pretty good product.</li>
    <li> This thing is the handiest thing ever. I wish I would have had one years ago. It’s soft pliable rubber that makes it easy to slip in the bottle of polish &amp; holds firm. It also has a slot in front so you can put the polish in at an angle. It took a couple or 3 weeks to arrive having come from China. ( I think it was China.) But who needs a nail polish holder in an emergency anyway, so I didn’t care how long it took. The sits secure without sliding or tipping be use of the rubber almost being soft rather than a hard plastic material that would probably slide around. It grasp the bottle tight but is ver easy to insert. I have only 2 different size bottle of polish. One of them is the round Revlon &amp; the other is rectangular &amp; they both fit great in the holder.The is so pliable that it will hug most bottle sizes. I going to order more because I just leave the polish in the holder when I’m done with my nails. Good luck.I wish I would have invented this little gadget. It’s one gadget that I will use all the time unlike a lot of the gadgets I have bought through the years that I thought were great ideas &amp; never using them.:)</li>
    <li> I actually bought this by mistake, however I  gave it to the tech at cosmetology school that does my nails</li>
    <li> It fits 3 of my 40+ bottles of nail polish. That&#x27;s it. Waste of money and Ionly got 1/2 of the order. 2pc usually means 2 pack/pieces or 2 items. Apparently not for this....</li>
    <li> Love it! Hands free working zone. Holds every shape of nail polish bottles. It made my life easer and mess free.</li>
    <li> These work great and the price was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared to wait on them for a while though, as it took a few weeks to receive this item.</li>
    <li> This product is a waste of money. First you wait for so long and then when it comes is crap. I was surprised I got two of them but polish bottles don&#x27;t fit right in these so that they bend to use the bottom part is polishes! I tried China Glaze, seche vite, and opi...nothing! They fit but there is no bend to get the bottom polish. So forget trying to put in odd shaped bottles! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> holder is not versatile, can only hold certain size bottles</li>
    <li> These holder are great they come in a set of two and I use a lot of OPI polish and don&#x27;t have a problem fitting these in like some reviewers mentioned .What I really like is these keep my polishes from tipping over I would say these would fit just about any polish out there except for Butter London polish being square shape. would recommend these .</li>
    <li> This product is easy to mold to your particular nail polish bottle. I tried several different shapes of nail polish and they all fit.  The best part is the nail polish can lean sideways when it is not full. So therefore you can get the polish on the brush without holding the bottle at an angle.</li>
    <li> When I got these I wasn&#x27;t sure if they would work with all my different types of Bottles I  have but they work great especially if you need to work with more than one colour but they fit the bottles and stayed put on my table and did not slide at all and they keep the bottles at the right angle so you can get the right amount of polish needed to do a perfect manicure. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> These work very well.  They hold all sizes of polish bottles and because of the material they are made from they stay put so they do not slide when you use them..</li>
    <li> Great for what it&#x27;s made for!! Keeps my polish from tipping. Works excellent when the bottle is almost empty and you need to angle the bottle to get the last bit of polish out.</li>
    <li> This item helps me get to the bottom of my bottle----it does not cost a lot, but helps greatly.</li>
    <li> The items arrived as expected. I enjoy giving these as gifts to my family and friend&#x27;s children. It keeps them from making little messes.  If you like doing your own nails, all little girl (as well as adult girls) should at least give them a try.</li>
    <li> Nice idea  Doesnt slip but hole only fits small round bottle to oval. I am a manicurist and it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work with most bottles I have.</li>
    <li> I have three of these already but I am buying them for stocking stuffers. Great idea and they do work well.</li>
    <li> The product came after the dates listed but it&#x27;s a good product.  It molds around whatever bottle I&#x27;m using for the day.</li>
    <li> The concept was right on target but it does not fit all bottles well. I have a lot of China Glaze and Nicole by OPI bottles and although they do fit inside the holder I had to stretch the holder to get it in. It does seems that it will eventually rip from the stretching. For $2.06 it was worth the try.</li>
    <li> These nail polish stands/holders are SO nice to have around!  They keep your bottles tilted at just the right angle to make doing your nails much easier.  They are made from a really flexible rubber so not only do they conform to most nail polish bottles, they tend to stay put on a table top so you can just dip your brush in the polish and go.  They really prevent a lot of fumbling around with the bottle and brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only disadvantage I can think of is time.  They come from Hong Kong so it takes a while.  But I can certainly live with that since the price is awesome and these are just so handy to have around!</li>
    <li> Really have to shove the bottle of polish to get it in.</li>
    <li> Excellent item for nail polish bottle. It handle its firm and the bottle no twist at all. Your hands are free.</li>
    <li> I have used this product quite a few times now and it works just fine.  I would, for sure, recommend this to anyone that has problems hold the polish bottle while doing nails.</li>
    <li> This took a while to come but it came from China and was told up front.  Works great and love it.  Came in a 2 pack, gave one to my daughter.</li>
    <li> I have a couple others rubber bottle holders and the opening on this one is way smaller than the rest. I usually use these for holding my top coat and this warps when I put not only my Seche Vite in it but China Glaze and OPI as well! It warps so much one half of the bottom is off the ground making it wobbly and completely defeating the purpose of the thing.Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product and good price.</li>
    <li> This seller sent my items promptly and both pieces came perfectly. At first I thought the holder would only be able to fit polishes like NYC or Pure Ice because the opening is small. However, it stretches out nicely and hold bigger polish bottles like OPI. Since two came, I use on for smaller polishes and one for bigger polish bottles. It&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
    <li> i havent used these since i purchased them because i haven&#x27;t found a nail polish of mine that fits in it. hopefully i do one day lol</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Price was right. Was exactly as described. Appears to be of good quality product. I have not used yet. Will buy again from this vendor.</li>
    <li> They are super useful and really a great deal</li>
    <li> Works great! No problems with fitting in different shapes or size bottles of polish! It holds all my polishes nicely! It makes painting my nails fun and easy! I love it!</li>
    <li> Too small for most bottles</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work as well as I&#x27;d hoped. I tried it a few times with different sizes and shapes of nail polish bottles. Not something I&#x27;ll be using regularly.</li>
    <li> I like my bottle holders, fits most nailpolish bottles, I will purchase more in the future, it toke for ever to come</li>
    <li> Love these.  Makes hand free application really nice.  You will need at least 3. One for base, one for color polish, and one for top coat</li>
    <li> Love this simple solution for nail polish mishaps.  Good product, I bought 2.</li>
    <li> Great great product.  No mess!!!!  Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Will fit most nail polish bottles. Allows for the bottle to be at an angle so you can get to the polish easily.</li>
    <li> These two items took quite awhile to arrive. Well worth the wait. They hold my nail polish and/or top coat without any spillage. I like that you can position the bottles at any angle you desire, especially if the polish is running low. I feel that the price is good for two sturdy bottle holders that hold the polish at any position you need to use your products...works especially well when you sit them down on a table top, but it works for me even when I hold them in my hand. I don&#x27;t do nail art, but I&#x27;m sure these will work to your satisfaction.</li>
    <li> family loved them&lt;br /&gt;thanks agian</li>
    <li> Cheap, effective item to get a bottle of polish to tilt, to get those last coats left in the bottle.</li>
    <li> Does not hold our nail polish very well</li>
    <li> These rubber stands have an awfully strong chemical smell. I threw them out due to the toxic smell.</li>
    <li> Love it a must have for the nail fanatic .very handy when the nail polish is low cuts painting time in half.</li>
    <li> Works great very happy.</li>
    <li> Does not hold any polish you may have as stated.</li>
    <li> It makes painting nails and toe nails so much easier . I got to of them and gave one to  my daughter and she loves it as well</li>
    <li> and I absolutely love it! Holds all of my polishes (all sizes/shapes) and it really does help prevent spills. Gives a great angle to get the drops at the very bottom. I&#x27;m definitely buying more!</li>
    <li> This nail polish holder is perfect and about 1/4 of the price of other ones I have seen advertised and on top of that you get 2 of them.  It holds every size bottle I have, oval, square, round.</li>
    <li> Way too small  and flimsy to hold most bottles of nail polish. Its also  not sturdy or strong enough to hold the small bottles in any way that would be helpful or make it worth using</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> THIS LITTLE ITEM HELPS ALOT..It holds just about any size bottle of polish.  The item advertises 2 piece, but I received 1.  Other than that, it does what it says.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful ordered two sets so I got four they hold any shape of bottle, great when product is half way or less, they are made of silicone and keep the bottle in place it took two weeks to get them but this is because they come from asia</li>
    <li> See that one in the photo...so tgwone I gotis a cheaper one, bad and horrible.&lt;br /&gt;I will sent it back...hate it and got so mad when I open the box.</li>
    <li> I am a little upset I ordered the 2 pcs and only received one The one I did receive works pretty good. This item comes from China and the customs slip reads phone case. It takes about 2 weeks for the item to arrive. Just be warned you may not get 2 pieces.</li>
    <li> These little holders work great!  Almost any bottle fits.  The only ones I&#x27;ve found that don&#x27;t work are my little bitty sample OPI bottles.  Some bottles tilt and stay tilted better than others, but it really doesn&#x27;t matter.  Once you put a bottle in and wedge it down to the tilt position, the holder bottom curves up a bit, like a rocking chair rocker.  Then you can easily grab the top of the bottle with one hand and tilt it down as far as needed to extract the last little bit of polish from the bottom of the bottle.  As you let go, the bottle returns to its original position without spilling.  I&#x27;d been looking and looking for something that would let me tilt the bottle with one hand, and this is it!!  And what a great deal.  TWO holders for such a low price!! Of course, I only needed one, so I gave the extra one to my daughter.  These don&#x27;t look very impressive, but they work!!</li>
    <li> Its alright won&#x27;t buy that again not so steady for nail art it seems to tip over very easy and that&#x27;s not good won&#x27;t know until u buy one RIGHT.</li>
    <li> This holder is very helpful and all my nail polish bottles (individually) fit in it seamlessly.</li>
    <li> I sure like this because I don&#x60;t have to hold it alone and its easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Rarely fits the nail lacquer I need it to. Obviously I&#x27;m not trying to fit a square bottle into this thing but the majority of the time the polishes are either to skinny or too fat. OPI and China Glaze don&#x27;t fit as comfortably as I would have hoped.</li>
    <li> Holds all shapes sizes and at different angles.</li>
    <li> I only received one of the two piece that was promised. I liked the one I received. Wrote to the company to date no word or product.</li>
    <li> Awesome item great service and fast shipping. I love this.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. Holds my polish snugly and prevents spills. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Holds a bottle of polish very well</li>
    <li> The soft plastic material that this holder is made from is nice.  However, it does not fit any of my nail polish bottles.  Thinking since the holder is so pliable it may fit any bottle but I was wrong.  Angela Nemesh is writing this feedback.</li>
    <li> Very pleased. Order arrived ahead of expected delivery date.</li>
    <li> Does keep your nail polish from tipping over</li>
    <li> This is the most wonderful product ever!!!! I paint my nails all the time, so I often spilled the polish.  Which sucked. Now I don&#x27;t.  Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> I finally received ONE of these this week.  Would love to know where the other one is.</li>
    <li> Really neat and helps from making a mess on the table.</li>
    <li> Does NOT hold rectangle (Avon), square (Lippman) or fat round (OPI) bottles. That leaves Wet n Wild type bottles. Thought side &amp;#34;walls&amp;#34;would stretch more to accommodate various sizes. Great idea though. It was worth trying, for the price!</li>
    <li> No more fumbling around tipping bottles! This holds your polish bottle at the perfect angle and won&#x27;t spill. I have two and should have bought three. One for the nail filler, one for color, one for sealer. Get this one ladies it is a great help.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty cool little tool!!!</li>
    <li> Too small to hold the nail polish bottle tipped so you can get all the polish out. I chose the wrong product.</li>
