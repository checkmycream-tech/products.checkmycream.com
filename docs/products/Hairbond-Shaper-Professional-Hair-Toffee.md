      <li>The control that this product gives you over your hair is outstanding.</li>
      <li>and I can say this  because I have tried a lot of hair products and never been satisfied until now.</li>

      <li>This is my favorite hair product now.</li>
      <li>I will continue to buy for sure.</li>
      <li>my favorite hair product</li>
      <li>&amp; there&#x27;s none better that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>I gave it a four stars because they could&#x27;ve done better with the smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure as some of you know</li>
      <li>You can always add more, but it&#x27;s not like you can suck shine out of your hair.  </li>
      <li>are some of the reasons why I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The formula I&#x27;ve created for the Shaper is: MORE PRODUCT &#x3D; MORE SHINE + GREASE.</li>
      <li>Perfect if you want that European look (David Beckham, David Villa, Miguel Velosso, Gerard Pique, Zayn Malik look), for hair tutorials I recommend going on youtube and looking up \\&quot;mhrrasmus\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I personally love how you can texturize and &amp;#34;piece&amp;#34; your hair.</li>
      <li>It also holds up surprisingly well during hot summer days.</li>
      <li>Its not shine or dry perfect texture.</li>
      <li>This was a combination of a dry matte finish product and a gel if I were to best describe it.</li>
      <li>I used to use American Crew Fiber which had ok hold but was really kind of sticky and think and didn&#x27;t feel good in my hair.  </li>
      <li>My son really likes this product because it has really good hold</li>
      <li>I just wish it was as easy to find as Moulder.</li>
      <li>It holds all day and rinses out easily with water.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Washes out easily as well.</li>
      <li>It holds shape throughout the day and is relatively easy to remove.</li>
      <li>It has a medium to strong hold</li>
      <li>It provides a strong hold with matte textured separation finish.</li>
      <li>: this product has a strong hold, also as suggested by the company (5/5).</li>
      <li>Strong Hold</li>
      <li>This is a really fantastic product.</li>
      <li>And it smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>It also smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product for hair styles where I want that shine like a pomade but without the oily residue.</li>
      <li>The smell is nice and the texture of it is really sticky.</li>
      <li>In this case, perhaps it&#x27;s not the most universal amazing smelling product.  </li>
      <li>The toffee scent smells good enough to eat.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a more shinny finish to their hair style.</li>
      <li>Smells like toffee which is cool</li>
      <li>COOL YOUR HAIR</li>
      <li>I personally prefer the moulder over this one but this is still a good product</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t live in a very humid area, so I cannot give a good review on whether or not it will hold up in humid</li>
      <li>, overall it&#x27;s an amazing product really strong.</li>
      <li>After using it for about a week, I quickly ordered another.</li>
      <li>i have no regrets this product is amazing</li>
      <li>It was exactly the hair product I always wanted!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Hairbond Moulder: similar to the shaper, differences are that moulder provides a more matte finish(no shine) and is not as strong as shaper</li>
      <li>For a tad less hold, Moulder offers a perfect matte finish and lots of texture.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells absolutely amazing, but that&#x27;s only my opinion.  </li>
      <li>this hair product is right for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>have very fine soft hair (2-4 inches long) and this product does a great job keeping it in place and allows me to style my hair without looking like some slicked back greasy cab driver.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Apparently many people don&#x27;t like the general scent of coffee/toffee/etc.  </li>
      <li>I can find strong hold elsewhere for a nice matte finish, and the smell isn&#x27;t enough to lure me back in.  </li>
      <li>In this category, it does pretty well compared to</li>
      <li>and I feel it is much better for my specific hair.</li>
      <li>Better than By Vilain, American Crew,</li>
      <li>Not so pretty.</li>
      <li>look; however, when I use it when my hair is hot, it does not hold as well as I would want it too...</li>
      <li>I first noticed and adored the packaging this hair product had.</li>
      <li>Other then that, this is an amazing product.</li>
      <li>it was good too, and all the one at walmart in the past.  </li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed when I got this in the mail: AWESOME packaging - heavy, quality hard plaastic, cool design, a large amount of product in one container.  </li>
      <li>Although it comes out beautifully in the shower with shampoo, it&#x27;s hard to wash it off your hands completely.</li>
      <li>It is really no surprise that my first review ever on amazon (after 5 years) is about a hair product, but I LOVE this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>product does offer a really strong hold FOR A WAX (creme).... if you&#x27;ve ever tried any of the By Vilain hair waxes, I think it&#x27;s hold factor is similar to those products.  </li>
      <li>I recommend it to anyone looking for a strong fold and a flat mat textured look.</li>
      <li>absolutely</li>
      <li>It styles my hair really well</li>
      <li>You can also play around and re-model your hair throughout the daywhich is also very fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My son really likes this product because it has really good hold and it allows him to restyle his hair throughout the day.  It helps that there&#x27;s a nice scent to the product too (toffee). However, he finds this product a little oily, hence the 4 star instead of the 5.</li>
    <li> I am quite the junkie when it comes to hair products. It seems like I am buying a new one every week!&lt;br /&gt;However, this is one product that I will be purchasing again. I am even shocking myself as I am saying this! I am Asian and my hair is not coarse, but not fine, 4 inches long in the front and in the crown and short on the sides. I style my hair in a quiff but a little more &amp;#34;spikier&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some of the reasons why I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- SMELL: it smells like vanilla, butterscotch with a hint of some woody, herby scent. I am quite a stickler for bad smelling hair product, so this immediately caught my nose attention when I smelled it. The smell is not overpowering, but it will stay with you for the entire day. I&#x27;m sure as some of you know, you get that nasty, oily smell to your scalp at the end of the day, but when I use this product, all I smell is that delicious, vanilla-y scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- HOLD: this product has a strong hold, also as suggested by the company (5/5). It keeps my hair up all day long. I don&#x27;t live in a very humid area, so I cannot give a good review on whether or not it will hold up in humid areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- TEXTURE: I have always been a fan of the matte look; however, there are some tendencies for some people&#x27;s hairs to look very dry and brittle if their hair is already lacking in moisture (especially those who use heat stylers or dye their hair). This product will give you a more-or-less matte finish with a slight (and i mean slight!) shine. All I can say is that it gives your hair a very healthy look - not too dry, not to wet. It makes my hair look lively instead of looking like it&#x27;s brittle and dry (which I sometimes get when I use certain waxes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- CONTROL/MANAGEABILITY: this product is awesome at giving you complete control over your hair style. I personally love how you can texturize and &amp;#34;piece&amp;#34; your hair. You can also play around and re-model your hair throughout the daywhich is also very fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- SMELL: now as much as *I* like the smell, some men may find this smell to be too feminine or &amp;#34;bubbly&amp;#34;. But keep it mind that there is a hint of that woody smell and trust me, lots of people have commented on how good my hair smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- WASH: Although it comes out beautifully in the shower with shampoo, it&#x27;s hard to wash it off your hands completely. I use a little soap and that helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS &amp; ADVICE:&lt;br /&gt;- DRY YOUR HAIR: I found that if I used this product when my hair was slightly damp, my hair would look very &amp;#34;moppy&amp;#34;. Not so pretty. So make sure that your hair is either completely or almost dry (especially if you have fine, thin hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- COOL YOUR HAIR: if you use a blow dryer to your hair like me to help with the styling, I suggest that you wait until your hair has completely cooled and/or you blow dry your hair with cool air before using this product. Because again, you will get that &amp;#34;moppy&amp;#34; look. It&#x27;s very odd... I&#x27;ve used this product in the summer when I am out in the sun a lot and I don&#x27;t get this &amp;#34;moppy&amp;#34; look; however, when I use it when my hair is hot, it does not hold as well as I would want it too... Just something to keep it mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are wanting to style or short, medium or long length hair in that very popular &amp;#34;quiff&amp;#34; look, or if you are just looking for a 2nd day, out of bed look, Hairbond Moulder is the product for you! This product gives you a healthy glow, high control and texture with a delicious scent - can&#x27;t ask more than that!</li>
    <li> Absolutely excellent for straight, fine, medium-length hair. I use it to style my hair into a side part, and it keeps the sides from puffing out and controls fly-away hair pieces while giving my hair a bit of a casual shine and texture. Shaper doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel sticky or stiff, and I can run my fingers through it all day. It also holds up surprisingly well during hot summer days. This is a really fantastic product. I just wish it was as easy to find as Moulder.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I was curious how it would compare to the moulder. The smell is nice and the texture of it is really sticky. I personally prefer the moulder over this one but this is still a good product</li>
    <li> Great product and smells good too!  I can&#x27;t stress enough you only need a small amount in your hand.  This will go a long way</li>
    <li> Works great and smells even better.</li>
    <li> The product has an amazing hold and an even great smell. It also gives my hair a lot of texture. My only complaint it how it feels in my hair. It would often make my hair feel gritty and gross to touch. Other then that, this is an amazing product.</li>
    <li> I first noticed and adored the packaging this hair product had. The product container has a very premium feel. The hair product itself smells and works great. It has a medium to strong hold but I often use hairspray so that didn&#x27;t affect me much. After using it for about a week, I quickly ordered another.</li>
    <li> The best hair product ever and I can say this  because I have tried a lot of hair products and never been satisfied until now. I used to use American Crew Fiber which had ok hold but was really kind of sticky and think and didn&#x27;t feel good in my hair.  Hairbond Toffee gives great hold, feels great in my hair and the scent is fantastic and not too strong.  Get this product, you will be very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PK</li>
    <li> I hate writing this review, because I was SO excited after ordering this product. I had watched plenty of reviews on YT and done my research and this product had VERY good reviews and looked incredible. I will get into the specific categories of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture: After putting this product into my hair, it felt as if the product was made by a distributor in a 3rd world country. It had a very amateur feel to it, certainly not that of a professional product.. This was a combination of a dry matte finish product and a gel if I were to best describe it. My hair looked VERY wet after the product was worked in and completely dry! I realize this is not a matte finish product but given the texture of it I certainly didn&#x27;t think it would give such a wet look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: This product smells absolutely amazing. No complaints there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold: This product by itself offers absolutely NO hold whatsoever. What I&#x27;ve come to learn after using hundreds of dollars in products, there really is no truly high-holding professional hair product that isn&#x27;t a gel. There is no such thing as a wax or anything other than a gel having a good hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, was very disappointed with this product..</li>
    <li> This product is the best. If you&#x27;re looking for that slick, Mad Men, Don Draper look this is the product you want. And it smells fantastic.</li>
    <li> This is the most Bad ass hair product I&#x27;ve had. I recommend it to anyone looking for a strong fold and a flat mat textured look.</li>
    <li> Hello, my name is Caleb West and I recently purchased Hairbond Professional Hair Toffee and have to say it did not live up to the hype. I also own Hairbond&#x27;s award winning product which is called Moulder and I feel it is much better for my specific hair. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a more shinny finish to their hair style. I knew that the product would be shinny but I did not like the shine that it gave to my hair. I would much rather have the Moulder, like I stated before, and for those of you who are not sure what that product looks like, it has a black logo and product name where as this one has gold. I say this product would be best for sleek looks. If you want something that you can reshape and change up throughout the day, then this is for you.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product for hair styles where I want that shine like a pomade but without the oily residue. It holds all day and rinses out easily with water. It also has  nice subtle fragrance.</li>
    <li> Smells like toffee which is cool but I feel it&#x27;s to hard of a hold for how I style my hair (messy quiff)</li>
    <li> Interesting hair product. Would definitely give it a shot. It is pricey but it lasts a long time. Its currently my product of choice.</li>
    <li> The Hairbond Shaper Toffee is amazing, I have a really hard time with my hair so I started using L&#x27;Oreal studio hair gel but I needed a lot of it to keep my hair straight, I was buying a new tube almost every week. I saw a video on youtube about this product and decided to get it and it is amazing, I just take a fingertip of it in the morning and it will stay straight all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a sidenote it does have a Vanilla and it is a little strong, I don&#x27;t mind it myself but I think some people would not like it that much, overall it&#x27;s an amazing product really strong.</li>
    <li> It was exactly the hair product I always wanted!</li>
    <li> It is really no surprise that my first review ever on amazon (after 5 years) is about a hair product, but I LOVE this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair dressers over the years have all commented to me on hair difficult my hair is to style and hold in shape, but this stuff does it with ease! The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard and stiff, its stays moldable throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without product my hair is straight up, but with this I can go from muppet to Don Draper in minutes. I will continue to buy for sure.</li>
    <li> my favorite hair product</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed when I got this in the mail: AWESOME packaging - heavy, quality hard plaastic, cool design, a large amount of product in one container.  Hairbond always excels here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does offer a really strong hold FOR A WAX (creme).... if you&#x27;ve ever tried any of the By Vilain hair waxes, I think it&#x27;s hold factor is similar to those products.  In this category, it does pretty well compared to it&#x27;s strong-hold wax competitors,,, But a wax really never has an extreme, sufficient hold for the entire day - if you want that, try gels or pastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consistency: Weird. Not tough to emulsify, feels more like a wet creme before you rub it in your hands. Just weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture: Wonderful.  Better than By Vilain, American Crew, maybe even Hanz de Fuko. It really made a difference in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I realized is that there is NO INFORMATION on the actual container about the finish it leaves in your hair - I figured out that this product does not supply a matte look; I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a low shine, but it&#x27;s kind of a greasy shine which I really don&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells absolutely amazing, but that&#x27;s only my opinion.  Apparently many people don&#x27;t like the general scent of coffee/toffee/etc.  In this case, perhaps it&#x27;s not the most universal amazing smelling product.  I heard Hairbond Moulder has a green apple/fruity scent, one I might like to try in the future.  Although the Hairbond Shaper smells wonderful, don&#x27;t let that influence your decision - it&#x27;s not like people can smell it in your hair, so performance matters most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your heart is set on this product, here&#x27;s a tip for use: start with a SMALL amount.  You can always add more, but it&#x27;s not like you can suck shine out of your hair.  Spend some time distributing it evenly throughout the roots and the rest of the hair, I find it further reduces the shine factor.  The formula I&#x27;ve created for the Shaper is: MORE PRODUCT &#x3D; MORE SHINE + GREASE. That means if you don&#x27;t like shine, sacrifice a little hold for a better look; finish it off with a bit of hairspray if you really want your to stick in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I wont be re-purchasing this product after I&#x27;m finished with it.  I can find strong hold elsewhere for a nice matte finish, and the smell isn&#x27;t enough to lure me back in.  However, since the texture is such a perk of this product, I think I&#x27;ll try Hairbond Moulder next.  For a tad less hold, Moulder offers a perfect matte finish and lots of texture.</li>
    <li> I used krieger hohne hair cream it was good too, and all the one at walmart in the past.  Seriously I have seen any product can do this, I can style my hair like professional quick less than 3 minute.  If you have hair always flat after gel or wax from other brand try this it amazing worth every penny. Its not shine or dry perfect texture.</li>
    <li> This product is the best. Smell is like a goodie ( candy or vanilla)&lt;br /&gt;When you apply on your hair it stay all day long the same as you set in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;It give the effect not shiny as wet look nor dry out. It make your hair look nourish and healthy.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best hair products I have ever used! You can do so much with it and it holds without being too sticky or heavy. My new go-to product!</li>
    <li> i have no regrets this product is amazing</li>
    <li> Took a while to get to me but boy what an excellent product. Great hold and flexibility. Washes out easily as well.</li>
    <li> It styles my hair really well and I have very thick and stubborn hair. It holds shape throughout the day and is relatively easy to remove. I gave it a four stars because they could&#x27;ve done better with the smell.</li>
    <li> I love this hair styler! Allows a lot of creativity and shape to your hair!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the Sh*t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You wanna be suave?&lt;br /&gt;You want your hair to have that matte finish and hold?&lt;br /&gt;You wanna be the next Douglas Bubbletrousers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then this hair product is right for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine soft hair (2-4 inches long) and this product does a great job keeping it in place and allows me to style my hair without looking like some slicked back greasy cab driver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great too!</li>
    <li> Very strong product great in that aspect, 10/10 smell, however it&#x27;s a thick cream texture and personally I have to mix it in with a couple drops of water every time I apply because of how thick it is. I would have loved an easier application</li>
    <li> Great product for styling!</li>
    <li> Awesome smell does its job.</li>
    <li> Do it. Your here because you&#x27;ve heard about this product &amp; you are considering buying it. DO IT. This is my favorite hair product now. The control that this product gives you over your hair is outstanding. I definitely would not advise putting only this in your hair before going out but used to get your hair exactly as you want it &amp; then spray it in place... absolutely &amp; there&#x27;s none better that I&#x27;ve found. It also smells fantastic. The toffee scent smells good enough to eat. Every time. Great hold. Great control. Easy to use. Buy it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! It gives my hair a strong hold, but doesn&#x27;t make it crusty, hard, or sticky. You can really move your hair around and shape it any way you want. Guess what, IT SMELLS LIKE TOFFEE!!! I&#x27;m definitely buying this stuff again when I run out, which will be a long time because there&#x27;s so much in the container.</li>
    <li> I have flat semi striaght hair. This product works very well with my hair. It provides a strong hold with matte textured separation finish. Perfect if you want that European look (David Beckham, David Villa, Miguel Velosso, Gerard Pique, Zayn Malik look), for hair tutorials I recommend going on youtube and looking up \\&quot;mhrrasmus\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other products I recommend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hanz de Fuko Sponge Wax: Matte textured finsh, although not completly matt, (gives a little natural shine)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Menkoi Matte Wax: made from organic products, Matte finish, gives hair volume, texture hard to find&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bed Head Matt Wax: Matte textured fnish, flexible&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ByVilain: Strong Hold matte finish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hairbond Moulder: similar to the shaper, differences are that moulder provides a more matte finish(no shine) and is not as strong as shaper</li>
