      <li>I love this body wash.</li>
      <li>Excellent for extremely dry skin.</li>
      <li>It is a great body wash because it leaves my skin soft and silky.</li>
      <li>The seller was very quick in sending</li>
      <li>This is a super all over body wash!  </li>
      <li>i wasnt able to find this product in stores near me for a long time- was very happy i was able to get it online</li>
      <li>I was fortunate to find this product on Amazon.</li>
      <li>she says it is the only thing that helps her skin and was so happy to find it.</li>
      <li>It gives you a good amount of lather and leaves my skin soft and not irritated.  </li>
      <li>I started using this when t first came out in the stores, but an not fi d it anymore, so i was pleased I found some, trying to sock up on it</li>
      <li>A little pricy, but a great find for me, since I love this product.</li>
      <li>Unlike some cleansers, this leave skin CLEAN and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>Love the product...paid way too much for it though...</li>
      <li>Really good purchase for dry skin or arid areas.</li>
      <li>My skin felt so much better after the shower that it was very clear that was indeed what it was from.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s the only thing I have been able to find in my lifetime of searching for products to help keep moister in my skin and keep it from itching!</li>
      <li>Not any more since I can buy Gold Bond Body Wash for Sensitive Skin.</li>
      <li>Very gentle, yet cleans well.</li>
      <li>I really like that part too!</li>
      <li>So, when it had first come out (the gold bond body wash) I bought them at wal-mart.</li>
      <li>I have only been able to buy it in sample sizes.</li>
      <li>Before I tried many different types of body wash.</li>
      <li>It is a good product for dry and sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I have extremely dry skin with many allergies to products.  </li>
      <li>so she does not use a large bottle of cream every week too.</li>
      <li>They no longer make it but the Gold Bond is very close to it in consistency and lather.</li>
      <li>This stuff works really well.  </li>
      <li>And I only needed a light body lotion after showering.</li>
      <li>It also works great as shampoo without irritating my scalp.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very grateful to have found it on Amazon, as no place has any.</li>
      <li>This body wash is very creamy and covers well.  </li>
      <li>Creates a lot of lather and is very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>but I am very allergic to this formula of this product line.  </li>
      <li>We scowered the internet and bought as much as we could afford to use as long as possible, hopefully 4 or more years worth.  </li>
      <li>This product is Incredible for extra sensitive skin and extra dry skin.</li>
      <li>I love the Gold Bond Ultimate Deep Moisture Body Wash Healing</li>
      <li>I use it for a few more days</li>
      <li>I bought it to use on a visit to my family in New Mexico.</li>
      <li>This product leaves my skin visably moist looking, and very soft and silky as well.  </li>
      <li>I was lucky enough to be introduced to this product at a local CVS.</li>
      <li>Puts all those other so-called sensitive skin soaps to shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it cheap at Big Lots, less than five bucks, and when I went back to get more, I couldn&#x27;t find it.</li>
      <li>I was happy to find a few since it is not available locally anymore.  </li>
      <li>so the fact that this product is fragrance free is a plus for me, and I&#x27;m a sucker for anything with oatmeal in it because oatmeal is so gentle and soothing.  </li>
      <li>It works, it calms my highly sensitive skin, and keeps it moisturized</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and this product works well for me.  </li>
      <li>I love ALL of the Gold Bond body washes, as the subtle fragrance of the &amp;#34;Healing&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;Softening&amp;#34; washes don&#x27;t aggravate my allergy, nor would the fragrance interfere with any perfume one would choose to wear.  </li>
      <li>By then we can only hope a new product will come out that will work as well.  </li>
      <li>If you have dry skin this will really help your issues.</li>
      <li>The next morning, he wakes up really itchy and red patches all over his chest.</li>
      <li>It lathered really well, was very concentrated, so I only needed a little for each shower.</li>
      <li>this is the only body wash recommended for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin by the doctor.</li>
      <li>Does not dry my skin out as much as some other bathing / shower products.</li>
      <li>and they improve it to the point it is no longer good for our sensitive skin or they discontinue it altogether :(</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff.  She can&#x27;t find this at any of the stores in our area.  This product is similar to the more expensive Clinique wash but at a faction (1/4) of the cost.  Doesn&#x27;t leave any film and is unscented.  If she&#x27;s happy I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> I love Gold Bond Ultimate Deep Moisture Body Wash.  You can&#x27;t get it any more, because it is no longer a product that Gold Bond makes.  So I was very happy to find it on Amazon and purchased it.  The seller was very quick in sending my Body Wash. When I run out, I only hope someone is still selling it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> It works, it calms my highly sensitive skin, and keeps it moisturized so I don&#x27;t have to slap a ton of cream on after bathing. Puts all those other so-called sensitive skin soaps to shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it cheap at Big Lots, less than five bucks, and when I went back to get more, I couldn&#x27;t find it. If I knew it was going to work so great and they weren&#x27;t going to carry it in the future, I would have bought every one they had. Here on Amazon, the cheapest I can find it is nine bucks. Ouch! Story of my life, I find a great product and the company stops making it.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this product works well for me.  It is impossible to find in my area so I get it through Amazon.  It gives you a good amount of lather and leaves my skin soft and not irritated.  I&#x27;ve tried the Dove products but they didn&#x27;t work for me.  The only other product that did was Oil of Olay Sensitive Skin Bodywash.  They no longer make it but the Gold Bond is very close to it in consistency and lather.</li>
    <li> This is a super all over body wash!  It is great to use from the top of my head to the tips of my toes!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Does not dry my skin out as much as some other bathing / shower products. will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Love this product it&#x27;s the only thing I have been able to find in my lifetime of searching for products to help keep moister in my skin and keep it from itching! I have a lot of allergies to soaps and things and this body wash is something I will be ordering for life!</li>
    <li> So disappointed that I can&#x27;t find this Body Wash locally. It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
    <li> I use this every day!</li>
    <li> It has great lather, and does not irritate my skin.  It also works great as shampoo without irritating my scalp.</li>
    <li> My mother swears by this body wash.  She says it&#x27;s the only product that keeps her skin from drying out in the winter.  It&#x27;s hard to find so I ordered it online.</li>
    <li> Excellent for extremely dry skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only body wash that truly does not bother my skin. I&#x27;m very grateful to have found it on Amazon, as no place has any.</li>
    <li> i wasnt able to find this product in stores near me for a long time- was very happy i was able to get it online</li>
    <li> I like Gold Bond lotions, so I thought this would be great.  However, it was not as softening as Dove body wash.</li>
    <li> Why did Gold Bond have to stop producing this?  I was happy to find a few since it is not available locally anymore.  It is the only soap my daughter&#x27;s sensative skin can use and keep it moistrurized enough so she does not use a large bottle of cream every week too. We scowered the internet and bought as much as we could afford to use as long as possible, hopefully 4 or more years worth.  By then we can only hope a new product will come out that will work as well.  We hate it when we at last find something good for us and they improve it to the point it is no longer good for our sensitive skin or they discontinue it altogether :(</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find it in this area (Middlesex, NJ) to purchase. I have only been able to buy it in sample sizes. It is a great body wash because it leaves my skin soft and silky. Before I tried many different types of body wash. None of them worked for my skin. My skin was always dry and flaky, like I had dandruff on my body, it was so bad. Not any more since I can buy Gold Bond Body Wash for Sensitive Skin.</li>
    <li> I cannot find this product anywhere in Charlotte, NC!  A little pricy, but a great find for me, since I love this product.</li>
    <li> This body wash is very creamy and covers well.  Creates a lot of lather and is very moisturizing.  I use it to shave, too.  Way better than soap!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister. she cannot find this in any store and I also looked. she says it is the only thing that helps her skin and was so happy to find it. thank you amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my sister couldn&#x27;t find it in Green Valley Az. too bad she couldn&#x27;t say thank you for a great product that shipped really fast and she didn&#x27;t pay for. I would buy it for myself next time.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to be introduced to this product at a local CVS. It was actually on clearance. It was impossible to find on the local shelves after that. I was fortunate to find this product on Amazon. It helps to soften my mother&#x27;s scars from her surgeries.</li>
    <li> My skin is really dry and this is the only stuff that helps to relieve the itchiness. I have tried other products but this is the only one. The only down side that it is very hard to find.</li>
    <li> I have a fragrance allergy so the fact that this product is fragrance free is a plus for me, and I&#x27;m a sucker for anything with oatmeal in it because oatmeal is so gentle and soothing.  This product leaves my skin visably moist looking, and very soft and silky as well.  I love ALL of the Gold Bond body washes, as the subtle fragrance of the &amp;#34;Healing&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;Softening&amp;#34; washes don&#x27;t aggravate my allergy, nor would the fragrance interfere with any perfume one would choose to wear.  The problem is,  it&#x27;s difficult to choose between these three products!  They&#x27;re ALL GREAT!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Gold Bond!  the best!  and nicely packaged as well.</li>
    <li> I started using this when t first came out in the stores, but an not fi d it anymore, so i was pleased I found some, trying to sock up on it The body wash is wonderful it smooths and moisturizes your skin without that oily feeling.</li>
    <li> This product could get 10 stars from me.  I have extremely dry skin with many allergies to products.  This plus the diabetic lotion has done amazingly well with no reactions.  The only problem is that I am having trouble finding it in stores.  Thank you for keeping this in stock.</li>
    <li> This body wash is wonderful!  It helps alleviate my dry skin.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash. It is moisturizing and is truly without ANY scent. It is so hard to find a body wash without scent, &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or otherwise.</li>
    <li> wonderful product.  Gets rid of the &amp;#34;winter itch&amp;#34; from dry skin.</li>
    <li> Conditions dry damaged skin after one use!  Never sticky or greasy. Absords well into skin and still leaves it mosturized. Will buy again soon.</li>
    <li> So, when it had first come out (the gold bond body wash) I bought them at wal-mart. I used them for about 6 months, then I went back and they no longer sold them and I had been unable to find them in any stores. At the time I was using them, it was great. It lathered well, smell wasn&#x27;t over powering and it didn&#x27;t make my boyfriend (who has extreme sensitive skin) itch or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward several months, I finally find it on Amazon. I bought two of them and me and my boyfriend started using it. The next morning, he wakes up really itchy and red patches all over his chest. He discontinues its use and it goes away. I tell him (my skin is not nearly as sensitive as his, and I never use on my face) I&#x27;ll continue to use it because it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I use it for a few more days and I start getting the same things as him (itchy,red patches etc) I stop using it and buy a different soap and it hasn&#x27;t happened again. My question is: What happened? It used to be a great soap. I&#x27;m not sure if mine have expired or not (cannot find a date on bottle)&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to recommend a different soap on a review for a product, but I would recommend not using this soap. At least, my boyfriend and I haven&#x27;t had any luck. Now I have two bottles and no idea what to do with them.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely wonderful.  I have used it for about a year but suddenly could not find it in the stores.  So glad you carry it.</li>
    <li> We have used this product for over 2 years and find the Amazon price and quality outstanding.</li>
    <li> I have used Gold Bond Body Wash for a while and love it.  You can feel the difference in your skin when you towel off.  This one is perfect for my granddaughter who has somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> this is the only body wash recommended for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin by the doctor. I love all the Gold Bond products.</li>
    <li> Within a few week callouses were removed from feet, elbows, and other dry skin irritation, including, you didn&#x27;t guess this, my business.  Have you ever heard males ask or complain about itchy balls?  I never would have guessed using anything for this but it clears up instantly.  About once a month, I use it total body (do not get in eyes) and the difference is incredibly refreshing.</li>
    <li> My wife was devastated that her favorite body wash was no longer being sold in the store. This met I had to search all over to find it.No worries. I found it on Amazon.com. Saved gas, time and looked like a hero. Arrived quickly in good condition. Now all is well with the world. Oh, yes, it really works well for her delicate skin. I really like that part too!</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin.  This stuff works really well.  Unlike some cleansers, this leave skin CLEAN and moisturized.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in any stores locally, so I was very happy to find it here.</li>
    <li> Very good quality, moisturising body wash. I bought it to use on a visit to my family in New Mexico. I always get terribly dry skin when I go there, in the arid desert conditions! This body wash was perfect;  incredibly moisturising, as well as not irritating my skin. It lathered really well, was very concentrated, so I only needed a little for each shower. And I only needed a light body lotion after showering. Really good purchase for dry skin or arid areas.</li>
    <li> This is the best body wash anywhere - but it&#x27;s now discontinued so I bought 3!  Wish Gold Bond would bring it back</li>
    <li> Hard to find in stores. Very gentle, yet cleans well. Makes plenty of lather with just a dab, great for leg-shaving, too!</li>
    <li> I truly love all the gold bond products! I start using this product when I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. It is a good product for dry and sensitive skin. I had recommend gold bond to other family members and friends. It has something for every part of the body. This product is very good, whether you are a diabetic or not.</li>
    <li> I do not understand this but I am very allergic to this formula of this product line.  I love the Gold Bond Ultimate Deep Moisture Body Wash Healing but when I decided to try another of these body washes I was shocked when I ended up itching all over until I showered and washed every bit of that wash off with the healing wash.  My skin felt so much better after the shower that it was very clear that was indeed what it was from.</li>
    <li> Love the product...paid way too much for it though...my bad...won&#x27;t happen again</li>
    <li> This is the best soap I have ever used. If you have dry skin this will really help your issues.</li>
    <li> Excellent ! This product is Incredible for extra sensitive skin and extra dry skin. Nothing else seems to work for me.</li>
