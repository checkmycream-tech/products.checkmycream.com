      <li>this machine is very good for everything, colours, realism, outlining... is very light and powerfull, doesn&#x27;t need too much energy to work so.. is very good...</li>
      <li>im sure you could put a good swiss motor in there</li>
      <li>arent the best for lining i do recomend this for a beginner but as far as a good tattooist dont be fooled by the images it is a cheap replica</li>
      <li>This machine is the bomb, its pressure sensitive to the foot pedal perfect when shading.</li>
      <li>Both of mine work perfect.came exactly as described, Great shipping got here weeks ahead of time in the holidays.</li>
      <li>Genius design very light, but prob with vibration/tension wheel.</li>
      <li>/&gt;just got it love to shade with it.</li>
      <li>I am sure I will probably never use this machine.... would not recommend....</li>
      <li>Perfect for simple tattoos.  </li>
      <li>Im satisfied.</li>
      <li>still working will probably be ordering a couple more soon</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure the real version of this machine works good, this just isn&#x27;t designed well for a s***ty rotary motor to be used in.  </li>
      <li>so i wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but upon receiving the item (which came early, shipping was great)</li>
      <li>Very good gun and quiet</li>
      <li>still does an amazing job pushing large mags !</li>
      <li>I think the machine will work fine, if I could ever use it.</li>
      <li>For a cheap price it works fine.  </li>
      <li>For a cheap machine, especially for someone just getting into tattooing, this is a great choice.</li>
      <li>cheap upsetting</li>
      <li>should be replaced for free but probably wont</li>
      <li>and it would run smooth as butter</li>
      <li>The retaining screw is made of plastic, as soon as you secure your grip it strips.</li>
      <li>The top snapped off easily after my first use.</li>
      <li>, I am very pleaded with this item, wow, works great</li>
      <li>Great machine, and price is great, does a better job than my $100 shader, might get another one to have it as a liner and sell all my other weak machines that stop working after 30 minutes of continuos use, and delivery was very quick</li>
      <li>It came quickly and was well packaged.  </li>
      <li>The plastic frames make them exceptionally lightweight and they have very low vibration and noise.</li>
      <li>Used one time and plastic parts broke in the middle of a tattoo, good thing it was tried out on myself first.</li>
      <li>its Chinese and it doesn&#x27;t line as good as the real dragonfly but rotary</li>
      <li>The machine is regular because i thought it would have much more potency...</li>
      <li>but u can just pop the top off only to put oil in it witch</li>
      <li>This is my first rotary machine</li>
      <li>Worth the little money it cost though, for sure.</li>
      <li>This machine is cheap and not at all adjustable and worked properly for approx one tattoo and now is sitting idle</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re lightweight quite and run smooth at low voltage.</li>
      <li>Absolute must for anyone that&#x27;s trying to get started on a budget</li>
      <li>but its not the real dragon</li>
      <li>Is the best, did not vibrate, makes no noise and is very light, use it yesterday for the first time and it took me almost half of what slow me with other machines</li>
      <li>I bought this machine as a back up The product got here quick.</li>
      <li>One last,thing, this machine can get very hot within a min on low voltage.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i&#x27;ve used other rotary before but never have mine burned out so quickly.</li>
      <li>witch will quiet it dwn a whole lot</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quiet, and does a decent job.  </li>
      <li>The machine is very light, and I&#x27;m not sure how well some of the pieces will hold up over time, but that&#x27;s to be expected for the price.  </li>
      <li>the pressure bar that pushes against the needle was very off center</li>
      <li>broke down in the middle of the first tattoo</li>
      <li>I started doing a tattoo with it and it died in the first few minutes.  </li>
      <li>Im very disappointed because it seem to perform perfectly when I got it</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Machine blew apart after 2 minutes if use and seller never answered my email</li>
    <li> The machine is regular because i thought it would have much more potency... The engine of the machine needs to be stronger</li>
    <li> Looks good.... Runs good.... Now to see if it lays ink good</li>
    <li> Machine works good.  It&#x27;s quiet, and does a decent job.  Even rotation and hit.  Perfect for simple tattoos.  I have one set up for lining and another for shading.  Lining is great, shading is alright.  Worth the little money it cost though, for sure.</li>
    <li> I think the machine will work fine, if I could ever use it. There is a piece hinged on the front that appear to have nothing to do with the machine, but it obviously does.I&#x27;ve looked on You-Tube and while there are plenty of videos on rotary guns, none include this weird part. Would it have killed someone to just put a small little piece of paper with how the gun looks setup? This gun may be a 5 star gun, but lack of documentation kills it.</li>
    <li> The retaining screw is made of plastic, as soon as you secure your grip it strips. Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Ran well for 10 min. Has,good days,&amp; bad . Genius design very light, but prob with vibration/tension wheel. still does an amazing job pushing large mags ! One last,thing, this machine can get very hot within a min on low voltage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure the real version of this machine works good, this just isn&#x27;t designed well for a s***ty rotary motor to be used in.  Can do black and gray with mine but never use them anymore some of them just kinda fell apart :p</li>
    <li> This product is horrible please don&#x27;t wast your money plastic cheap upsetting I will never buy this again and that&#x27;s the bottom line</li>
    <li> dnt attempt to use for lining not very strong has alot of give and a big stroke havent tried shading with it yet still runs just u ge4t what u paid for and there is no ajusting the give looks like there is but u can just pop the top off only to put oil in it witch i recommend as soon as u get it to put 15W 40 motor oil in it witch will quiet it dwn a whole lot</li>
    <li> Got mine today and Im impressed. for the price of these machines there output is great. They&#x27;re lightweight quite and run smooth at low voltage. Both of mine work perfect.came exactly as described, Great shipping got here weeks ahead of time in the holidays. Good product. Im satisfied.</li>
    <li> For a cheap machine, especially for someone just getting into tattooing, this is a great choice. I bought 4 (2 Black/2 Red) and have done all my tattooing with them. The plastic frames make them exceptionally lightweight and they have very low vibration and noise. And at the cost, if any of them ever go belly-up, they can be replaced for the cost of a small bottle of ink. Absolute must for anyone that&#x27;s trying to get started on a budget</li>
    <li> broke down in the middle of the first tattoo i used it on. garbage. if i could give it no stars i would. should be replaced for free but probably wont</li>
    <li> five star, very good price</li>
    <li> Very good gun and quiet, I am very pleaded with this item, wow, works great, I will be getting another one soon.</li>
    <li> This machine is cheap and not at all adjustable and worked properly for approx one tattoo and now is sitting idle</li>
    <li> Used once n still working will probably be ordering a couple more soon</li>
    <li> Great item.good shipping</li>
    <li> it Work good for 2 weeks and when out</li>
    <li> very weak, the adjusting screw out of adjustment easily.</li>
    <li> This machine works great!</li>
    <li> For a cheap price it works fine.  I&#x27;m just getting my feet wet and plan on upgrading.  But for now I&#x27;m content.</li>
    <li> This is my first rotary machine so i wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but upon receiving the item (which came early, shipping was great) i was displeased at the construction quality. I never got to use this machine, it broke before i could use it. the pressure bar that pushes against the needle was very off center and when i tried bending it back, it broke. maybe it&#x27;s just a fluke though and maybe this one was just defective. but i can only write a review based on what i know, and so thats that.</li>
    <li> Used one time and plastic parts broke in the middle of a tattoo, good thing it was tried out on myself first. I had to pull out a trusty 10 wrap dual coil standard machine to finish the job.</li>
    <li> The only reason i didnt give this a half star is because it wouldnt let me. I bought this machine as a back up The product got here quick. I opened the box, set the machine, and pressed the peddle. ........nothing. I swiched clipcords, still nothing. I could hear the motor getting power but got no function. I WOULD NOT buy this product. Do your research and purchase one that is going to work. There are plenty others on this site. Signed \\&quot;Pissed of consumer\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Im very disappointed because it seem to perform perfectly when I got it and then it just went out on me and my older brothers did the same this is ridiculous..</li>
    <li> This machine is the bomb, its pressure sensitive to the foot pedal perfect when shading.Its just as good as the stigma version !;ima get anotha one just because.</li>
    <li> I loved this gun it doesn&#x27;t stall when I use it and I like that udont need a rubber band to hold your needles. I&#x27;ll probably buy this again...&lt;br /&gt;Note: it is plastic so its not sturdy</li>
    <li> this is a good product and it runs well but its not the real dragon the seller should let you know i bought this for my son and found out that it wasnt quite the machine he was looking for. its Chinese and it doesn&#x27;t line as good as the real dragonfly but rotary arent the best for lining i do recomend this for a beginner but as far as a good tattooist dont be fooled by the images it is a cheap replica im sure you could put a good swiss motor in there and it would run smooth as butter</li>
    <li> I ordered this machine because I wanted to try out a rotary.  It came quickly and was well packaged.  The machine is very light, and I&#x27;m not sure how well some of the pieces will hold up over time, but that&#x27;s to be expected for the price.  I started doing a tattoo with it and it died in the first few minutes.  I contacted the seller and they immediately sent a replacement via next day mail, I&#x27;v done a tattoo with the replacement machine and it worked well.</li>
    <li> Great machine, and price is great, does a better job than my $100 shader, might get another one to have it as a liner and sell all my other weak machines that stop working after 30 minutes of continuos use, and delivery was very quick</li>
    <li> Is the best, did not vibrate, makes no noise and is very light, use it yesterday for the first time and it took me almost half of what slow me with other machines</li>
    <li> Works good I like to Line with it, for shading I like the stealth 2&lt;br /&gt;just got it love to shade with it.</li>
    <li> The top snapped off easily after my first use. Also the connecting rod keeps getting stuck in one place. Unsuccessful.</li>
    <li> The quality of this gun is absolutely terrible..I am sure I will probably never use this machine.... would not recommend....</li>
    <li> mine burned out in 5 minutes of testing!! didn&#x27;t even get to use it on skin!&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve used other rotary before but never have mine burned out so quickly. oh well. good thing i didn&#x27;t pay alot for it.</li>
    <li> this machine is very good for everything, colours, realism, outlining... is very light and powerfull, doesn&#x27;t need too much energy to work so.. is very good...</li>
    <li> poorly made machine not worth wasting your time or money on</li>
</ol>
