      <li>Enjoy  was recommended by a friend who is an experienced hairdresser.  </li>
      <li>Love Love Love this brand of hair products!  </li>
      <li>I LOVE all Enjoy products!</li>
      <li>My hair is much more manageable, softer and combs out without snarling.  </li>
      <li>Enjoy !</li>
      <li>My hair has become 10 times stronger and healthier since I started using this product with the enjoy conditioner line as well!</li>
      <li>I use Enjoy brand all of the time and my hair is thicker and longer than before I started using it.</li>
      <li>but Enjoy is always my go to.</li>
      <li>I have used this shampoo for a long time it works and feels great on my hair.</li>
      <li>I am a fan of the Enjoy products but not on a consistent basis.  </li>
      <li>so it is a good choice to swtich it up with other products.  </li>
      <li>This is an OK shampoo, but you won&#x27;t be able to use it every day because of the build-up on your hair which makes it limp.  </li>
      <li>I have not used it and will not use it because the smell is simply too strong.  </li>
      <li>I have fine, dyed blonde hair and it does not strip it of moisture.</li>
      <li>Well worth the couple extra bucks I used to spend on cheap shampoos that left my hair with breakage.</li>
      <li>Nice non-synthetic minty small.</li>
      <li>This does a decent job of adding volume.  </li>
      <li>I also use other Enjoy products.</li>
      <li>I have tried dozens of shampoos -- high end to mass market -- hoping to find one which would leave my thin frizzy hair smooth and easy to comb out while wet.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair dry after using it for a week or two....switched back to Enjoy&#x27;s other types of shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>

<li> Gotta get it on your hair fast otherwise the thick glob falls on shower floor.  </li>
<li> I find that they do dry out your hair</li>
<li> Also I have reason to believe the product is fake as all my other Enjoy purchases came factory sealed</li>

    <li> Smells like minty listerine.  This chemical/mint smell is not something I would want in my hair.  I have not used it and will not use it because the smell is simply too strong.  Also I have reason to believe the product is fake as all my other Enjoy purchases came factory sealed but this one came leaking and without a seal.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair dry after using it for a week or two....switched back to Enjoy&#x27;s other types of shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>

    <li> I LOVE all Enjoy products! I have to switch up every once in a while to give my hair some change but Enjoy is always my go to.</li>
    <li> I use Enjoy brand all of the time and my hair is thicker and longer than before I started using it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was no different than what I am using now.  Probably won&#x27;t purchase again for the price.  Just alright.</li>
    <li> Best hair product leaves your hair silky</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for a long time it works and feels great on my hair. I also use other Enjoy products.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of the Enjoy products but not on a consistent basis.  I find that they do dry out your hair so it is a good choice to swtich it up with other products.  This does a decent job of adding volume.  I have literally tried every shampoo they make and I find that they are all drying.  It seems to keep my color lasting longer so that is why I do use it..</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful volumnizing shampoo. I have fine, dyed blonde hair and it does not strip it of moisture. I am a repeat buyer of this product. Simply put, it works!</li>
    <li> This is an OK shampoo, but you won&#x27;t be able to use it every day because of the build-up on your hair which makes it limp.  I occasionally use this shampoo, but alternate with a couple others that remove the detritus and then one that adds moisture if my hair gets too dry. I color my hair every 4-5 months.</li>
    <li> I have tried dozens of shampoos -- high end to mass market -- hoping to find one which would leave my thin frizzy hair smooth and easy to comb out while wet. Enjoy  was recommended by a friend who is an experienced hairdresser.  I am a believer!  My hair is much more manageable, softer and combs out without snarling.  I don&#x27;t plan to look further.</li>
    <li> Gotta get it on your hair fast otherwise the thick glob falls on shower floor.  Nice non-synthetic minty small.</li>
    <li> works great, like product, would buy again, a a a a a a a a a a a a a</li>
    <li> Great service and just what i was looking for. A great product. Enjoy !</li>
    <li> I purchase this for my Grandaughter because it works great on her oily hair. She also uses the leave in conditioner which she swears by. If you have oily hair than this is def the products you should be using</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for colored hair</li>
