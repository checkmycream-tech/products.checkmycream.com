      <li>Amazon&#x27;s price for this 3-pack is the best deal I&#x27;ve been able to find recently.&lt;br /&gt;*This</li>
      <li>I just dont know why they stopped making it since it made many lists for great smelling shampoos!</li>
      <li>Aveeno does make really good conditioners, though.</li>

      <li>Nice smell and works well.</li>
      <li>This is a very good dandruff shampoo but right after I started using it, it disappeared from store&#x27;s shelves.  </li>
      <li>vendor is easy to work with, great and love this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried most of the dandruff shampoos and conditioners on the market (both store brand and high-end), but none of them work as well as this one.</li>
      <li>I used to be able to find it at Walmart, but they no longer seem to carry it.</li>
      <li>So I decided to use this more often.  </li>
      <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner</li>
      <li>Our favorite shampoo.</li>
      <li>This is my all-time favorite shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>We use almost all of the Aveeno products love them all.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave hair looking greasy, like most anti-dandruff shampoos</li>
      <li>I LOVE the smell of it</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>and I got this because all my prescription meds make my head itch even more.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
      <li>so thankful AMAZON carries it because I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores.</li>
      <li>Love it,</li>
      <li>I wish they made it in a fragrance free kind.</li>
      <li>I suffer from a dry itchy scalp, this shampoo is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s given me a great hair</li>
      <li>Smells great and leaves hair soft even without conditioner</li>
      <li>Other than that, I am very happy with the results.</li>
      <li>So far, this is the best product I have found (and I have used many), but it still doesn&#x27;t completely kill the itch.</li>
      <li>Reduces dandruff and leaves my hair super shiny!</li>
      <li>After much hemming and hawing I got him to try this shampoo; his hair has never looked and felt better!  </li>
      <li>Best dandruff control we have tried hands down!</li>
      <li>Not only does it get rid of dandruff, but it&#x27;s just a fantastic shampoo and smells great.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo it makes my hair soft and smells really nice as well.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out and smells great.</li>
      <li>This is by far thee best shampoo that I have used recently.</li>
      <li>Was recommended this by my derm since I am pregnant and can&#x27;t use my medicated shampoo for my dandruff.</li>
      <li>It leaves my wavy, dry hair very easy to manage and the smell is just heaven!</li>
      <li>Not harsh like most dandruff shampoos.  </li>
      <li>Really helps to control and minimize my dandruff and leaves my hair nice and soft.</li>
      <li>I have tried many dandruff shampoos, and this one is by far the most effective -- at least on me.</li>
      <li>Seems to control my dandruff better than others I&#x27;ve tried, and does it gently leaving hair soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>Neutrogena T Gel is far far better.</li>
      <li>I liked buying it in the store because I could use a coupon to make it a little cheaper, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be an option anymore.</li>
      <li>Do not recommend scratching scalp a lot before using this product as I have done so before and it was really traumatizing.</li>
      <li>It feels and looks so much healthier.&lt;br /&gt;*This</li>
      <li>Gentle and does the work.</li>
      <li>I also switched to Aveeno skin calming products and my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in a long, long time.</li>
      <li>shampoo is hard to find, so this 3-pack is a great find, especially at this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that this shampoo made my hair look/feel better than an of the other Aveeno shampoo products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>It really does make your hair feel soft too.</li>
      <li>My hair tends to get frizzy with other shampoos, but this Aveeno makes it so smooth and soft!</li>
      <li>Other dandruff shampoos either strip all the moisture from my hair or make it super greasy.</li>
      <li>And my scalp is in great shape and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel too dirty on the off days.</li>
      <li>my hair incredibly soft without needing a separate conditioner.</li>
      <li>My hair is soft, shiny</li>
      <li>This is the first shampoo I&#x27;ve used in a long time that also helped my skin.  </li>
      <li>It does not dry out your hair but seems to work no better on dandruff than any other good dandruff shampoo.</li>
      <li>Love the shampoo but 2 of the bottles leaked during shipping-what a mess!!!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried t-gel, tea tree, head and shoulders and various natural shampoos.</li>
      <li>This one in particular can lessen the scalp itchiness than other dandruff shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

    <li> Great product.  Not harsh like most dandruff shampoos.  Works and leaves hair in great condition.</li>
    <li> I dont even have dandruff!!! I LOVE the smell of it BUT they dont make it anymore so if you see it? BUY IT! It leaves my wavy, dry hair very easy to manage and the smell is just heaven! I just dont know why they stopped making it since it made many lists for great smelling shampoos! SHAME AVEENO, SHAME!</li>
    <li> I have used Aveeno hair products for quite some time.  Recently I noticed that I had a bit of dandruff and so decided to try Aveeno&#x27;s drandruff shampoo.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that this shampoo made my hair look/feel better than an of the other Aveeno shampoo products I&#x27;ve used.  Amazing!  My husband has had dandruff forever and has used numerous products over the years with various outcomes.  After much hemming and hawing I got him to try this shampoo; his hair has never looked and felt better!  I will continue to buy this shampoo for many years, and recommend buying in bulk via Amazon as it saves a fair amount of money.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> This shampoo changed my life.  I&#x27;ve always had a dry itchy/flakey scalp.  I tried all sorts of different dandruff products etc.  Nothing worked.  So I get stuck either not washing my hair often, or using lots of conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this stuff, I wash every other day.  And my scalp is in great shape and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel too dirty on the off days.</li>
    <li> I have tried many dandruff shampoos, and this one is by far the most effective -- at least on me.</li>
    <li> I have super dry, thick, curly hair and this is the ONLY product that has helped with my dandruff. I&#x27;ve tried t-gel, tea tree, head and shoulders and various natural shampoos. This is the only one that works. Not only does it get rid of dandruff, but it&#x27;s just a fantastic shampoo and smells great. Other dandruff shampoos either strip all the moisture from my hair or make it super greasy. This is the perfect balance. I don&#x27;t find that you need to use the corresponding dandruff conditioner for it to work. Aveeno does make really good conditioners, though. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do if they ever stopped making this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Nice price and nice product</li>
    <li> Reduces dandruff and leaves my hair super shiny! Can&#x27;t ask for more. And it smells delicious!</li>
    <li> LOVE!!! This is by far thee best shampoo that I have used recently. Really helps to control and minimize my dandruff and leaves my hair nice and soft. Do not recommend scratching scalp a lot before using this product as I have done so before and it was really traumatizing. Other than that, I am very happy with the results.</li>

    <li> Best dandruff control we have tried hands down!</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s given me a great hair day!!!&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully dundruff goes away soon</li>
    <li> Smells great and leaves hair soft even without conditioner</li>
    <li> Nice smell and works well.</li>
    <li> This is a very good dandruff shampoo but right after I started using it, it disappeared from store&#x27;s shelves.  I do hope it has not been discontinued.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo but 2 of the bottles leaked during shipping-what a mess!!!  The 3rd btl. was wrapped in plastic so it didn&#x27;t leak.  Would be a good idea to wrap all liquids!!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing shampoo. Started buying them in packs of three. Help with a flaky dry scalp and my hair is so silky after starting to use Aveeno.</li>
    <li> I have terribly itchy scalp. So far, this is the best product I have found (and I have used many), but it still doesn&#x27;t completely kill the itch. It did substantially help with dandruff though. My only other complaint is that both times I have ordered it, a bottle was busted or leaking.</li>
    <li> Seems to control my dandruff better than others I&#x27;ve tried, and does it gently leaving hair soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Feeling after washing, no special surprise</li>
    <li> Dried my hair..not for coarse, AA hair. Neutrogena T Gel is far far better.</li>

I&#x27;ve tried most of the dandruff shampoos and conditioners on the market (both store brand and high-end), but none of them work as well as this one. I have really long hair and only wash it several times a week to avoid overdrying it and my scalp. With this Aveeno product, I don&#x27;t have any itching in between washings. It truly does nourish my scalp and hair without stripping it or leaving it feeling &amp;#34;slippery.&amp;#34; I hope Aveeno will continue to produce this wonderful product and that Amazon always has it available.</li>
    <li> Only thing that works on my dandruff without ruining my hair color. It really does make your hair feel soft too.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo it makes my hair soft and smells really nice as well. We use almost all of the Aveeno products love them all. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Our favorite shampoo. I love the smell of all Aveeno shampoo I&#x27;ve tried! This one in particular can lessen the scalp itchiness than other dandruff shampoo I&#x27;ve tried. I was having a hard time finding it in stores. Good thing, Amazon has it and at a more affordable price.</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis and I got this because all my prescription meds make my head itch even more.  So I decided to use this more often.  It helped a little but I am having a lot of trouble finding something that takes away the itching in my head.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! Doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out and smells great.</li>
    <li> This is the first shampoo I&#x27;ve used in a long time that also helped my skin.  My hair is soft, shiny, my scalp doesn&#x27;t richard no dandruff!  I also switched to Aveeno skin calming products and my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in a long, long time.</li>
    <li> this shampoo is the best, works great, gets rid of dandruff and keeps hair shiny, love the feel and look of the product. vendor is easy to work with, great and love this product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave hair looking greasy, like most anti-dandruff shampoos</li>
    <li> Was recommended this by my derm since I am pregnant and can&#x27;t use my medicated shampoo for my dandruff. Been using it seven months now and it does not work!</li>
    <li> I suffer from a dry itchy scalp, this shampoo is wonderful.  Love it, so thankful AMAZON carries it because I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist.  It does not dry out your hair but seems to work no better on dandruff than any other good dandruff shampoo.</li>
    <li> i have psoriasis and eczema at times on my scalp. It can itch alot. This shampoo has helped stop the itch and calmed down my scalp. I wish they made it in a fragrance free kind.</li>
