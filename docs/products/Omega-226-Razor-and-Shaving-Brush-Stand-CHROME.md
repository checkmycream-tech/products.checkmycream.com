### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is perfect for my needs.</li>
      <li>This Omega, however, is the perfect piece.</li>
      <li>Fits my Merkur HD 34C and Tweezerman Shaving brush perfectly.</li>
      <li>stand fits my Merkur Futur razor perfectly, along with the travel</li>
      <li>Very happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent quality... looks great and does the job perfectly&lt;</li>
      <li>and it is still a beautiful, gleaming focal point beside our en suite</li>
      <li>That said, the holder is attractive and appears to be well made.  </li>
      <li>Looks great, well crafted.</li>
      <li>A great stand for my Edwin Jagger brush and safety razor.  </li>
      <li>Great stand.</li>

      <li>Very nice razor stand.  </li>
      <li>Good quality - my husband is quite happy with this stand.</li>
      <li>This handles both of those perfectly - though my full-size bush at home fits in it just fine also.</li>
      <li>Good product (except I&#x27;lll be a tad bit irritated if one of my Simpsons fall out, and hits the floor)</li>
      <li>Good price.</li>
      <li>great, compact, practical display that looks nice and dries my TAoS brush.</li>
      <li>Nice stand, works great with my 34c and brush.</li>
      <li>Looks good, everything fits.</li>
      <li>This product is very well constructed is perfect for holding the brush and razor is something that I know I will have for years</li>
      <li>Looks nice.  </li>
      <li>I prefer it aesthetically and functionally to many others.</li>
      <li>A larger razor holder would make this perfect.</li>
      <li>old Gillette Superspeed fits great</li>
      <li>The finish and construction on the stand I received was fine.  </li>
      <li>However, it is solid, looks great, and it&#x27;s compact size, for me, is a plus as it does not take up space on the basin.  </li>
      <li>This stand allows you to securely have your razor and brush on the counter without taking up a lot of space.</li>
      <li>I have decided to keep the stand since it is functional, and my razor (ej de87bl) does fit in it.</li>
      <li>None of them quite fit the minimalistic style I was looking for to keep everything in place.</li>
      <li>The finish is not a uniform bright shiny chrome, but rather is brushed and marred in places.  </li>
      <li>It is great for holding the brush but the new razors have handles that are too big to fit the holder.</li>
      <li>balances well and arrived quickly</li>
      <li>This is a tremendous stand.</li>
      <li>After considering other options, I thought this would  be a good choice both for the size and look of the stability of the stand, and it fulfills those parameters.  </li>
      <li>Quality finish, sturdy, and just the right size to hold my wares.</li>
      <li>but it is a pretty popular and standard model.</li>
      <li>Finally a super nice stand for my bigger than normal Omega Pro 48 brush.</li>
      <li>Real stainless steel, highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I have looked at many stands since diving back into the DE world of shaving.</li>
      <li>Decided to go more classical styling.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>It definitely fits most DE razors (e.g. Merkur or EJ).</li>
      <li>I was ready to give up, because I wasn&#x27;t interested in paying a couple hundred for the Merkur branded stand.</li>
      <li>Clean, simple, fits brush - just the right gift for my husband.  </li>
      <li>I really like the simplicity of this stand.  </li>
      <li>know some people are bummed it doesn&#x27;t fit a big Gillette cartridge razor</li>
      <li>This holder keeps everything in place and is very stable</li>
      <li>Keeps my new Silvertip Badger properly dry and shaver and brush are now neatly stored, decluttering my vanity top.</li>
      <li>The stand is smaller than you would think, not necessarily a bad thing though, very compact.</li>
      <li>Looks nice but to small .</li>
      <li>I have no idea if this is more or less durable than the chrome finish</li>
      <li>Recommend highly.</li>
      <li>This is a terrific stand, well made, and nicely compact in size, taking up little real estate on the vanitorium.</li>
      <li>Nice stand, however a little short for longer badger hair brushes.</li>
      <li>All in all it&#x27;s just what I need, and though light enough for travel it&#x27;s sufficiently well made and sturdy that it seems as though it should last for years.</li>
      <li>I have a large ceramic safety razor and brush stand on the sink at home, but I needed something a lot smaller and lighter for travel.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sturdy, bright chrome and simplistic in it&#x27;s design and construction.</li>
      <li>The brush ring was a little tight but a small adjustment and it fits perfect.</li>
      <li>I used a light grit sandpaper to deburr some of the edges that were sharp enough to cut you, or damage your razor.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s slick and tiny,  nice shine and color, but It fits only slim razors, so I had to return it.</li>
      <li>; in that position until I re-work them into their normal shape at my next use.</li>
      <li>It really depends on the stand and how wide the holder is.</li>
      <li>and I have barely wiped or cleaned the stand itself</li>
      <li>Only one complaint, which I can try to fix with pliers, is, excluding my Semogue 620, which has more of a flat spot art top of handle, other brushes like to sit uneven, or even fall out.</li>
      <li>I mean, if you have a manual cartridge razor it may fit but the battery powered ones won&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>My travel razor is a Merkur Classic Safety Razor, and the shaving brush I take on the road is a slightly smaller than average travel brush by Edwin Jagger.</li>

<li> My travel razor is a Merkur Classic Safety Razor, and the shaving brush I take on the road is a slightly smaller than average travel brush by Edwin Jagger.</li>
<li> The stand arrived quickly, but was of poor quality not matching photo advertised.  </li>
<li> It would be a good choice for a razor with a smaller diameter handle base.</li>
<li> Box was not marked Omega.  </li>
<li> It fits my EJ DE89 razor and Vie Long brush well, though longer brushes may not do so well.</li>
<li> It was also significantly smaller than I expected.  </li>
<li> So while it does hold the brush upside down when I&#x27;m letting it dry, it pinches several of the hairs outside of the holder, leaving them &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34</li>
<li> On the other hand those come with horizontal plastic stands that also hold extra cartridges.</li>
<li> Had a hard time, mainly since I refused to spend $90, on a brush/razor combo for my Merkur Futur.</li>
<li> I recognize that maybe my brush is just ever so slightly wider than the standard shaving brush</li>
<li> I expected it to look as pictured, with a mirrored chrome finish.</li>
<li> but that&#x27;s not really the function.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not going to say that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;too short for my Omega 48&amp;#34;, because, albeit a little tight at the knot, and it almost bottoms out.....</li>
<li> Like some of the other reviewers here I received the knock off version of this stand.  </li>
<li> Not many other reviews had the actual dimensions of the stand, so here they are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Read description bring it only guts small razors .</li>
<li> I tried 2 other ones that I purchased on Amazon (don&#x27;t remember their names) unsuccessfully.</li>
<li> With your razor and brush in one stand, it takes up half the space, which means you don&#x27;t feel cramped or surrounded with a razor in your hand.</li>
<li> Probably the first Amazon purchase I have made that I have ever been unhappy with.    </li>
<li> It came in a little box, which said CHROME on the label, but when I opened it it was a brass/gold color.  </li>
<li> By doing that it makes placing and removing the brush a little easier.</li>
<li> The brush holder does not properly fit my brush.</li>
<li> long handle razor and the base of the razor is too large to fit in the razor holder in the base.  </li>
<li> My first bad purchase from Amazon.</li>
<li> It holds my brush, with no problem and takes up very little counter space.  </li>
<li> A bit small</li>
<li> Unfortunately, the section to hold a razor is too small for a standard Gillette Fusion razor handle.  </li>
<li> and it seems so small on the counter but does the trick.</li>
<li> I have to agree with the other lower starred reviews in regards to the poor quality.</li>
<li> Only complaint is that I have to hang my brush, which is not very long, from the base of the bristles rather than a point on the handle.</li>
<li> Mine is dull silver, not chrome, and does not have Omega stamped on it.</li>
<li> I ordered not from Amazon but from a certain auction site that we all know and hate from an authorized Omega dealer.</li>

    <li> The brush holder does not properly fit my brush. I recognize that maybe my brush is just ever so slightly wider than the standard shaving brush but it is a pretty popular and standard model. So while it does hold the brush upside down when I&#x27;m letting it dry, it pinches several of the hairs outside of the holder, leaving them &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; in that position until I re-work them into their normal shape at my next use.</li>
    <li> delivered as promised, the stand holds my DE89 and a medium size brush very nicely. would buy again.</li>
    <li> Had a hard time, mainly since I refused to spend $90, on a brush/razor combo for my Merkur Futur. Looks good, everything fits. Only one complaint, which I can try to fix with pliers, is, excluding my Semogue 620, which has more of a flat spot art top of handle, other brushes like to sit uneven, or even fall out. That&#x27;s the only ding. I&#x27;m not going to say that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;too short for my Omega 48&amp;#34;, because, albeit a little tight at the knot, and it almost bottoms out..... That&#x27;s not what it was purchase for. Good price. Good product (except I&#x27;lll be a tad bit irritated if one of my Simpsons fall out, and hits the floor) so I don&#x27;t set it up to fail. I keep the Semogue in there, as that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s happiest with.</li>
    <li> Great stand. Fits the biggest omega brushes including the Pro 48. Although, you may need to widen the portion that holds the brush with a pair of pliers. By doing that it makes placing and removing the brush a little easier. I have two of these stands and on one of them, I didn&#x27;t need to make adjustments. It really depends on the stand and how wide the holder is. Again, great stand.</li>
    <li> The stand arrived quickly, but was of poor quality not matching photo advertised.  Poor chrome plating (dull), machine cuts in razor tube not square and edges not deburred.  Box was not marked Omega.  Possibly a knock off (speculation on my part).</li>
    <li> Returned it as it was the wrong color.</li>
    <li> I have looked at many stands since diving back into the DE world of shaving. None of them quite fit the minimalistic style I was looking for to keep everything in place. This Omega, however, is the perfect piece. Quality finish, sturdy, and just the right size to hold my wares. If you are looking for a quality item for your kit, don&#x27;t hesitate on this one. You will be happy with the purchase...I am.</li>
    <li> Nice stand, works great with my 34c and brush.</li>
    <li> This holder keeps everything in place and is very stable</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent quality... looks great and does the job perfectly&lt;br /&gt;My old Gillette Superspeed fits great</li>
    <li> Read description bring it only guts small razors . Looks nice but to small .</li>
    <li> I really like the simplicity of this stand.  It holds my brush, with no problem and takes up very little counter space.  Unfortunately, the section to hold a razor is too small for a standard Gillette Fusion razor handle.  A larger razor holder would make this perfect.</li>
    <li> It is great for holding the brush but the new razors have handles that are too big to fit the holder. I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great stand, fits Omega Boar brush</li>
    <li> The only drawback is that it is a smaller stand, so if size and height are what you are looking for, then this is not the stand for you.  However, it is solid, looks great, and it&#x27;s compact size, for me, is a plus as it does not take up space on the basin.  A great stand for my Edwin Jagger brush and safety razor.  Recommend highly.</li>
    <li> Works for a standard Mach 3 razor but doesn&#x27;t work for a Fusion razor.  Holds a standard shaving brush with no difficulty.</li>
    <li> Clean, simple, fits brush - just the right gift for my husband.  Does not take up space - affordable quality.</li>
    <li> This stand allows you to securely have your razor and brush on the counter without taking up a lot of space. With your razor and brush in one stand, it takes up half the space, which means you don&#x27;t feel cramped or surrounded with a razor in your hand. It&#x27;s sturdy, bright chrome and simplistic in it&#x27;s design and construction.</li>
    <li> This is a tremendous stand. I prefer it aesthetically and functionally to many others. It fits my EJ DE razor quite well along with a Vie-Long shaving brush. This uses a minimal footprint and goes with nearly any decor. I&#x27;ve had it a couple of months and I have barely wiped or cleaned the stand itself and it is still a beautiful, gleaming focal point beside our en suite sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some people are bummed it doesn&#x27;t fit a big Gillette cartridge razor but that&#x27;s not really the function. I mean, if you have a manual cartridge razor it may fit but the battery powered ones won&#x27;t. On the other hand those come with horizontal plastic stands that also hold extra cartridges. It definitely fits most DE razors (e.g. Merkur or EJ).</li>
    <li> ...I&#x27;m sending mine back.  It has nothing to do with the quality of the stand.  I use a Merkur 38c long handle razor and the base of the razor is too large to fit in the razor holder in the base.  That said, the holder is attractive and appears to be well made.  It would be a good choice for a razor with a smaller diameter handle base.</li>
    <li> Looks great, well crafted. Only complaint is that I have to hang my brush, which is not very long, from the base of the bristles rather than a point on the handle. The stand is smaller than you would think, not necessarily a bad thing though, very compact.</li>
    <li> This product is very well constructed is perfect for holding the brush and razor is something that I know I will have for years</li>
    <li> Looks nice.  balances well and arrived quickly</li>
    <li> A bit small but I buy everything a bit larger and it seems so small on the counter but does the trick. The brush ring was a little tight but a small adjustment and it fits perfect.</li>
    <li> Good quality - my husband is quite happy with this stand.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s slick and tiny,  nice shine and color, but It fits only slim razors, so I had to return it.</li>
    <li> Finally a super nice stand for my bigger than normal Omega Pro 48 brush. Real stainless steel, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Nice stand, however a little short for longer badger hair brushes.</li>
    <li> great, compact, practical display that looks nice and dries my TAoS brush.</li>
    <li> The one I received was the gold brass instead of the chrome. I have no idea if this is more or less durable than the chrome finish but time will tell eventually. It does hold my EJ brush and DE89bl razor but I can&#x27;t say I like the gold colour as it looks a bit tacky to me. In case you are wondering, yes it is the Omega stand - the company name is stamped on the back of the razor holder.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with the other lower starred reviews in regards to the poor quality. I expected it to look as pictured, with a mirrored chrome finish. The finish is a dull silver and parts are marred and burred, very poor construction all together.. Probably the first Amazon purchase I have made that I have ever been unhappy with.    Update - (1-8-2015) I just returned it. Couldn&#x27;t see scratching my new Futur on something so terribly made.</li>
    <li> I ordered one of these from the seller SimplyBeautiful.  It came in a little box, which said CHROME on the label, but when I opened it it was a brass/gold color.  It was also significantly smaller than I expected.  I bought it intending to use it to hold an Omega Pro 48 brush but it wasn&#x27;t anywhere close to being big enough.  Needless to say I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific stand, well made, and nicely compact in size, taking up little real estate on the vanitorium. It fits my EJ DE89 razor and Vie Long brush well, though longer brushes may not do so well. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Very very small.  Would not fit my straight razor or brush.  Beware this is only for a smaller razor</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t a fan. Decided to go more classical styling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a razor and brush stand that would hold my Merkur Futur for a while. I tried 2 other ones that I purchased on Amazon (don&#x27;t remember their names) unsuccessfully. I was ready to give up, because I wasn&#x27;t interested in paying a couple hundred for the Merkur branded stand. Found out about this stand from a razor forum where somewhere recommended it. I ordered not from Amazon but from a certain auction site that we all know and hate from an authorized Omega dealer. The stand works! And it is stamped with the name on the back - I&#x27;ve read some reviews on here where folks said their stands weren&#x27;t stamped so they were worrying about authenticity. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Very nice razor stand.  Not many other reviews had the actual dimensions of the stand, so here they are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside diameter of the razor holder: 9/16&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Depth of the razor holder: 1 1/2&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Inside diameter of the brush holder: 1 1/8&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Gap of the brush holder: 1&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Stand length: 2 7/8&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Stand width: 1 7/8&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Stand height: 2 3/4&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand fits my Merkur Futur razor perfectly, along with the travel brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I wish was different was that the stand would come in a satin finish to match the razor and brush.  Oh well, I knew what I was getting.</li>
    <li> The brush stand holds the brush where the bristles meet the handle, not from the end of the handle. Fits my Merkur HD 34C and Tweezerman Shaving brush perfectly.</li>
    <li> Keeps my new Silvertip Badger properly dry and shaver and brush are now neatly stored, decluttering my vanity top.</li>
    <li> I have a large ceramic safety razor and brush stand on the sink at home, but I needed something a lot smaller and lighter for travel. This is perfect for my needs. My travel razor is a Merkur Classic Safety Razor, and the shaving brush I take on the road is a slightly smaller than average travel brush by Edwin Jagger. This handles both of those perfectly - though my full-size bush at home fits in it just fine also. All in all it&#x27;s just what I need, and though light enough for travel it&#x27;s sufficiently well made and sturdy that it seems as though it should last for years.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a stand. It holds my razer and electric tooth brush (I don&#x27;t use the shaving foam brush)</li>
    <li> The item received is not as pictured.  The finish is not a uniform bright shiny chrome, but rather is brushed and marred in places.  In addition,  the box and item show no Omega marks...I suspect this item is no longer made in Italy.  Finally, the tube that holds the razor has a visible overlap of the metal which could damage your razor.</li>
    <li> My first bad purchase from Amazon. Like some of the other reviewers here I received the knock off version of this stand.  Mine is dull silver, not chrome, and does not have Omega stamped on it. I used a light grit sandpaper to deburr some of the edges that were sharp enough to cut you, or damage your razor. I have decided to keep the stand since it is functional, and my razor (ej de87bl) does fit in it. My stand was sold by FGP. If you choose to buy this stand you might try a different supplier.</li>
    <li> After considering other options, I thought this would  be a good choice both for the size and look of the stability of the stand, and it fulfills those parameters.  The finish and construction on the stand I received was fine.  It works with my Gillette adjustable and Ever-Ready F40, and also can accommodate my Edwin Jagger 89Lbi and Parker synthetic brush.</li>
