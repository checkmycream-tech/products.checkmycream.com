<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> terrible.  nothing compares to triple paste.</li>
    <li> Works really well.  It prevents and heals diapers rash well.  It also helps relief pain for older kids if they are infected with a rash.</li>
    <li> My daughter struggled with extreme diaper rash.  She has terribly sensitive skin so we were constantly battling rashes.  We tried several other diaper creams, with mixed results.  I chose this product because of it&#x27;s size (we don&#x27;t need to buy diaper cream for another decade!) &amp; because we had heard good things about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works!  It always cleared up my daughter&#x27;s diaper rashes.  In fact, we still use this product on our 3 year-old because she still gets very bad rashes when she isn&#x27;t cleaned well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is VERY thick!  When I put this product on my daughter I have to wash my hands very thoroughly with soap &amp; water to get the cream off my fingers.  That shows how waterproof this cream is!  The thick cream is also very soothing.  My daughter comments that she feels better right away.  I appreciate how effective this product is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem that we have is that this product stains clothing very badly!  We used cloth diapers &amp; the liners are completely stained,  We also have to strip the diaper regularly because this makes the fabric waterproof (which isn&#x27;t food for cloth diapers!).  Because we occasionally have to use this product on our 3 year-old, several pairs of her underwear are stained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is an amazing product.  Just be careful when you use it.  Don&#x27;t wipe your hands on your clothes!</li>
    <li> Price was good, but doubt it was &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; based on the packaging. The top piece that seals the container had a piece cracked off and there&#x27;s a chance it could dry out. Since i needed it badly, i&#x27;m just using it anyway and not asking for a refund. The product itself is good, but the packaging and newness is highly questionable.</li>
    <li> Used one time on our baby and her diaper rash was GONE. Now we use a little at every changing. She hasn&#x27;t had a sign of rash since.</li>
    <li> This cleared up my mother&#x27;s bedsores!</li>
    <li> An experienced mom clued me into this product when our now four-year-old was a few months old. We had used a variety of diaper cream products by then, and found them to be fine but not foolproof.  We had not experienced any bad cases of diaper rash with the other products, thank goodness, but we definitely had some  rashes pop up and persist for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With child number one, we switched to Butt Paste entirely after seeing how quickly it cleared up a minor diaper rash, and for the rest of her time in diapers had ZERO diaper rashes. (And trust me – we try to stay on the ball, but we definitely aren&#x27;t the type of parents who change a kid the split second something happens.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to child number two. I forgot to lay in a supply of Butt Paste before her arrival, so we made do with a few other products. Sure enough, she started to got get a minor redness/irritation within the first week or so. Then the Paste arrived, and within one day it was completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My current thinking is, why use anything else?</li>
    <li> I got the package.  it is a think paste.  I used it on my behind,  It sure soothed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but it is kind of gooey.</li>
    <li> We love this and it gets the job done!</li>
    <li> The only cream I will use for my child. Cures a rash quickly and keeps it away.</li>
    <li> I found that it works just fine (soothed baby&#x27;s bottom, protects, etc.) but I find the smell to be weird. Not bad, just odd. Somewhere between a chai tea latte and oatmeal raisin cookies ...gone wrong. I also found that Boudreaux&#x27;s gets a little grainy between the cracks after a while. I don&#x27;t think this causes baby any harm/discomfort, but for me, it&#x27;s a little icky. My favorite diaper cream in the world? Weleda Calendula Diaper Care. Smells herbal and clean, goes on smooth - we&#x27;ve used it proactively and haven&#x27;t had a single rash or problem in our baby&#x27;s 4 months of life. The best!</li>
    <li> Smells faintly of cookies, protects the skin extremely well.  Somewhat oily so don&#x27;t use too much or it&#x27;ll make a mess of your towels.</li>
    <li> Very soothing, easy to apply, and it actually smells pretty good. Plus it&#x27;s got an awesome name...</li>
    <li> My fingers and feet get dry then sometimes crack and bleed in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried every skin product known to man. The others worked but took a week or more. Butt Paste has taken care of the problem in two to three days. I do not have to apply it every day. Usually a couple times a winter and I am good to go.[[ASIN:B001526EDO Boudreaux&#x27;s Butt Paste, Diaper Rash Ointment, Tube 4 oz (113 g)]]</li>
    <li> We have been using Boudreaux&#x27;s on our kids since my almost 4 year old was a baby and it is amazing (she doesn&#x27;t need it now but her baby brother does). Whenever a friend or relative gets pregnant, the first thing I tell them is to buy the big jar of it! It is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Used it on all three of my babies to prevent diaper rash.  Works better than Desitin and A&amp;D.</li>
    <li> As a first time parent of a newborn, it&#x27;s easy to be overwhelmed by the number of products for something as simple as diaper creme.  We started off with using Boudreaux&#x27;s then began to use a tube of Aveeno&#x27;s (both recieved as shower gifts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I liked the Aveeno just fine (and continue to use it in the diaper bag), when that tube ran out I was eager to switch back to the butt paste.  I thought the Boudreaux&#x27;s was a little more silky, and went on a lot smoother.  Aveeno had a nice thick paste, which was fine but it required a lot more and wasn&#x27;t as easy to spread.  Plus I liked Boudreaux&#x27;s scent too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some other reviews saying they switched to citric rather than boric acid, and it was irritating to their baby, so the first thing I did when I got the tube was check out the ingredients.  The tub I got said boric acid, so I&#x27;m not sure if they switched it back to the original recipe or if I got an older tub.  I ordered a second tub recently, and that one was boric too.</li>
    <li> Both my sons have an extremely sensitive skin, and the buttpaste has been the best!!  For my kids it&#x27;s so much better than Desitin.  Goes on easy and stays on and protects their butts through the night.  The smell really isn&#x27;t that bad either!  Love it and recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a fellow baseball player&#x27;s parents. It is the only thing we&#x27;ve found that presents chafing that comes with all-day baseball tournaments and sweaty sliders/baseball pants.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak to how well it works on diaper rashes as I noticed immediately that it stains cloth diapers and had to stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a yucky tan/brown color, which again, doesn&#x27;t impact its performance... but it&#x27;s just not the color you want (staining your diapers) or rubbin&#x27; on your lil&#x27; one&#x27;s bum!</li>
    <li> Butt Paste has been a very helpful product.  I used it a lot when my daughter was little, but even at the age of 4 she sometimes gets rashes and Butt Paste clears it up quite quickly.  I prefer this over Desitin.  The Desitin left a really strong smell, I don&#x27;t think Butt Paste&#x27;s smell is as strong, though my husband disagrees.  The reason I took off a star is that it can stain my daughters underwear.  When it comes to my daughters comfort though, I&#x27;m more concerned with quick healing.  I will continue to use Butt Paste.</li>
    <li> My grand daughter is very sensitive to foods and was getting a little rash every time something new was introduced. No other signs of problems (gastro) and she eats very healthy food so I read the reviews and tried this. I apply it at every diaper change when I babysit and she never has a rash. GREAT stuff.</li>
    <li> At first we used Butt Paste to heal a diaper rash, which it did quickly. Now we use Butt Paste with each diaper change to prevent rashes and chaffing. It smells nice, it&#x27;s conditioning, and we haven&#x27;t had any rashes since using it preventatively as a barrier. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I love the big tub that this stuff comes in. My newborn daughter has a very sensitive rear end and gets diaper rash and irritation very easily.  This stuff goes on easily and also wipes away a lot easier than other popular diaper creams.  The only thing that I hate about this stuff is the scent.  The smell reminds me of regurgitated bubble gum! LOL.  Seriously, thats what it reminds me of.  That is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give this item a 5 star rating.  Once you get the diaper on and baby clothes, the smell isn&#x27;t that noticeable.  I use this stuff at every diaper change and we have no further diaper rashes on our newborn daughter.</li>
    <li> Works really well, pleasant smell, gentle on baby&#x27;s skin and natural ingredients! Overall a great cream for baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. no diaper rash for our little one; we&#x27;ve been using since birth. This jar/tub is more convenient than the tubes to keep by changing table (but not really ideal, space-wise for diaper bag.) Although, once you finally get down to the last amount at the bottom, it gets more difficult to reach your finger all the way down to scoop some out. (your hand won&#x27;t fit unless you have freakishly long skinny fingers.)  Just grab a butter knife to reposition the last bit, up on the edge.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff for my daughter! She hasn&#x27;t had a diaper rash since I used Desitin on her and the when she broke out I bought this because the &amp;#34;Butt Paste&amp;#34; grabbed my attention. I imagined a protective paste and that&#x27;s what it is! I use cloth diapers and read reviews that it stains them but I haven&#x27;t had that problem. She is 7 months and has been sleeping through the night since around 4 months and I needed something that would last. I don&#x27;t use the cloth at night but buy a special nighttime diaper this does the trick and protects her fanny all night long! It washes off easily in the bath and between changes wipes off easily with a baby wipe. I will not use anything else ever!</li>
    <li> FAVORITE diaper rash product!</li>
    <li> I received this butt paste for my baby shower and was really excited after hearing all of the great reviews. Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work for us. My son develops diaper rashes and personally, I don&#x27;t like how thin it is when you apply it - it doesn&#x27;t seem to do the job well. I like the idea of it being in a tub though, as it&#x27;s much easier when you&#x27;re changing the babies diaper to just dip your finger in rather then squeeze a tube, but that&#x27;s really the only part I like about it!</li>
    <li> My son never had any problem with diaper rash till he was about 1, then he started getting a rash about every 2-4 weeks, especially when he was teething.  It was awful, it would be so raw and red and it would usually bleed.  We started leaving diapers off while he was awake and around the house and sat him on the toilet every hour or so, just to help keep him dry, but it seemed like nothing helped.  We use cloth diapers and had tried all kinds of different CD safe creams but really it never seemed like anything helped.  I discovered this product and we started putting it on his bottom every night (he sleeps in disposables anyway) and since we started using this, around 16 mos old, we have had NO problem with diaper rash.  He has started to get red a couple of times but it always goes away before it bleeds or seems to bother him.  I am just kicking myself for not using this much sooner, I could have saved the poor little guy a lot of discomfort :(.  On the bright side, he is almost completely potty trained and not even 2 yet so that&#x27;s a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have the 16 oz jar and have been using it daily, sometimes twice a day, for 6 mos and still have about 1/3 a jar left.  We bought the 2 oz tubes to use for travel.  LOVE this stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a good price for a big tub. I love this stuff as it works great to help clear up rashes but it does seem to stain and I&#x27;m not sure we will use the whole thing before the kids are out of diapers.</li>
    <li> I have used this on my daughter for a diaper rash, and it has worked great. It is not as thick as I would prefer, and I don&#x27;t mind the smell at all, but it really does improve the rash quickly. I think that the very thick cream that the hospital gave me works a bit better, simply because it sticks to the skin more.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very sensitive skin and we battled diaper rash for a while. I tried a few different creams including Boudreaux&#x27;s. This product made the rash worse. It caused her skin to crack and seemed very painful. We finally visited pediatric dermatologist who prescribed a prescription cream which cleared it right up. I was told for future rashes to use only Vaseline/Aquaphor because most diaper creams have a fragrance added that can irritate the skin more.</li>
    <li> I bought a bunch of different diaper rash creams before giving birth - Desitin, Bordeaux&#x27;s, Mustela Vitamin Barrier Cream, Aveeno.  This is by far the best!  And it&#x27;s actually easier having it in a tub - if you have one hand holding your babies&#x27; legs, you can&#x27;t have just one hand trying to squeeze something out of a tube.  With a tub it&#x27;s just lift lid, dip finger, swipe on butt!</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on internet research and reviews. I was looking for a safe, non-toxic diaper rash cream. The smell is not as bad as some people say. The consistency is thick but not as thick as some other conventional diaper rash cream. Unfortunately, after a brief period of use my son started to develop an allergic reaction to the butt paste. My husband suspect it&#x27;s the Peruvian Balsam that was the cause. Certainly it&#x27;s something in the butt paste because the allergic reaction (red rashes in blotches all over the body including parts that did not come into contact with the paste) would come on strong soon after the paste has been applied and then disappears as soon as we wash it off thoroughly. What a shame because now we have a huge tub of Butt Paste and can&#x27;t use it anymore!</li>
    <li> my baby got mild diaper rash at the hospital, we were stuck there for a week, the nurses used zinc oxide ointment to treat it. my husband bought some before we left the hospital because we didn&#x27;t know we&#x27;d be able to take the stuff from the hospital home with us. he bought A+D with zinc oxide in it. we used the stuff from the hospital for a few days then put that tube in our diaper bag since it was small and began to use the A+D. within 3 days the diaper rash got out of control and was all over my daughter&#x27;s bum, getting scaly and pimply with each diaper change. i remember using this on a kiddo at a daycare center i briefly worked at and decided to use it. we were lucky to find it on clearance at target for only half the price! and my god, within JUST ONE diaper change, the redness had reduced dramatically. by the next day it was almost all gone. by day 2 it was gone. this stuff is amazing! it&#x27;s been almost a month since we&#x27;ve had it. we use it either every few days as needed and only about 1/4 of the tub has been consumed. i don&#x27;t know what people are talking about with the smell, it&#x27;s not bad at all. in fact, my husband who is from ireland, says it smells like chocolate yogurt he used to eat back home and every time he applies it he&#x27;s tempted to scoop some into his mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in my mind there are NO CONS to this stuff. buy it. use it. no need to abuse it.</li>
    <li> Have bought tub after tub of this, love it and so does my baby&#x27;s bum.</li>
    <li> Butt paste is the only diaper rash ointment that works for my son. I had seemingly tried every other product on the market, and nothing would clear up his diaper rash. Then, somehow I ended up with a couplon for Boudreaux&#x27;s Butt Paste, and I decided to give it a try. The results? His diaper rash was cleared up by the next day. Not only did it relieve him of the irritating rash, but by applying it a couple times a day, the rash doesn&#x27;t seem to come back. In addition, Butt Paste has a pleasant smell. It is not medicinal, but has a mild scent of sarsaparilla. I recommend this product to any mommies and daddies out there looking to cure and prevent diaper rash on their little babies.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get rid of our baby&#x27;s rash; seemed to make it a little worse even. Nice scent, but won&#x27;t be buying again for lack of effectiveness. Burt&#x27;s Baby Bee ointment is much better and doesn&#x27;t contain petroleum, though it is more expensive.</li>
    <li> Used this for two kids.  Never got a single diaper rash.  Recommend this for all new moms.  Should be used with each diapering.  Absolutely love this product.  Wipes off easily.  Pleasant smell.  A must have.</li>
    <li> I tried about 6 different types of diaper rash cream,  ranging from the popular and commercial to the organic and boutique, and this is the only thing that works every time. Its amazing. And one jar will last forever.</li>
    <li> My son developed a small rash in his inner thigh that was getting irritated by the elastic in his diaper.  I tried everything. Weleda, California Baby, Aveeno, Aquaphor, and even Honest company. Nothing helped. Weleda made it worse. Finally, after a week, I finally tried Boudreaux&#x27;s Butt Paste. Within ONE diaper change, the redness was gone. Two diaper changes later, the rash was almost completely clear. I will NEVER stop using this for my son. It worked wonders. I&#x27;m thoroughly pleased and the flip top lid is uber convenient.</li>
    <li> As an adult that has had a problem with incontinence for the past two years, I woke up with a very bad case of diaper rash about two months ago.  I tried the normal products that I could purchase locally for weeks and nothing helped.  I finally purchased the Butt Paste from Amazon.com out of desperation and because of the good reviews that it received.  The Butt Paste has worked very well for me. It has a pleasant smell, applies easily and soothes the itch and tenderness from the rash. My symptoms are almost completely gone at this time which I am very thankful for. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff. I use it at every diaper change and my baby&#x27;s skin has never had even a hint of rash. This tub isn&#x27;t cheap, but there is a ton of cream in it - well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I recently did an extensive review of this butt paste on my blog. I include lots of pictures, list pros and cons, and whether or not I would buy this paste again. It is my sincerest hope that my review helps somebody! [...]</li>
    <li> So far has done a great job in preventing diaper rash for my 1 month old. I wish the stuff didn&#x27;t get all caked around the baby&#x27;s boys genitals though.</li>
    <li> I used this for a sunburn sweat rash on my hairline that was red and itchy like crazy. The pharmacist at a grocery store recommended it and the rash was gone in 3 days! Zinc is used in sunscreen so it prevented further sunburn too</li>
    <li> I love the large size. Its a good value. My granddaughter has very sensitive skin &amp; this works well for her</li>
    <li> best butt paste around</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! My baby girl had an ugly rash almost from birth due to all the runny breast milk poops. It just kept getting worse and worse no matter what natural stuff I was using (Grovia, Angel Baby, Coconut Oil, Shea Butter, open to air)  Once I started using this paste, the redness cleared up and her butt looked much better! I did need to keep using it for a few weeks after the redness went away, now she&#x27;s fine without and we just use it if the redness flares back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BONUS - For those that use cloth diapers there is a natural version of this paste in a green colored container that is safe to use without a liner on your fabrics.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic!  FInally I&#x27;ve found a solution that doesn&#x27;t involve cortisone cream, which my doctor had to prescribe.  Cortisone seemed only to treat the result of my yeast or fungal rash, but never kill the fungus itself.  Now, for the first time in years, I am basically rash fre.  I use this product sparingly after my shower and love it!  Doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.</li>
    <li> We have twins and go through a lot of diaper cream. We&#x27;ve tried everything out there, and this is the one we keep coming back to. It&#x27;s been great about keeping diaper rash away, it smells pretty good (compared to the medicine smell of most of the other brands) and it&#x27;s pretty cheap. The only product I like better is the Burt&#x27;s Bees stuff, but it&#x27;s way too expensive.</li>
    <li> It spreads easily, does have the advertised good smell, and a little bit goes a long ways.&lt;br /&gt;The tub is so much better than the tube especially for those frantic times when you only have one hand available and you need to act fast. The lid easily flips open and even when it is running low you can easily and quickly scrape along the bottom while still holding squirming feet with your other hand.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I do not give it a full five stars is because it is a bit difficult to get off of clothes.</li>
    <li> I like this brand of diaper cream, but the lid on this container is a little flimsy. With the quantity of cream in this container it&#x27;s going to be around for a while and the container should be made to last.</li>
    <li> Laug at the name all you want but it does the trick for diaper rashes or bed sores!</li>
    <li> We have been using Butt Paste for eight months now and my son has NEVER had diaper rash. This stuff is amazing! Love it! We are forever customers!</li>
    <li> I know everyone swears by Butt Paste, but I&#x27;ve since switched to Aquaphor. My daughter developed a terrible diaper rash AFTER I started using this. Perhaps she has a sensitivity to one of the ingredients. Overall, the texture just felt waxy. I&#x27;m a much bigger fan of the natural (green packaging) Butt Paste.</li>
    <li> This cream seems to work very well on diaper rash and smells really good. It also wipes away easily and I don&#x27;t feel like I need to scrub to get any excess off of my daughter. The only reason I am rating it 4 stars is for the lid on the jar. Within a day of opening it (opening the lid maybe 3 times?), the hinge on the flip top lid cracked and broke half way through. Now, we are just extra careful when opening and closing the jar so that rest of the hinge doesn&#x27;t break. A little disappointed in the jar construction, but otherwise it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> Big container of Boudreax&#x27;s Butt Paste was a great value and works grea, and is an awesome baby shower gift</li>
    <li> Great value, love the closable top!</li>
    <li> I have 4 kids and have used this stuff for years. It works great and has always cleared up even the worst diaper rash.  I mainly use it for diaper rash but have been know to use it for chapped lips and hands too.  Really love the jar.  Mine has a flip top and it&#x27;s so easy to access when changing a diaper.  I also like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to squeeze the life out of a tube to get the last bit out ;)</li>
    <li> This cream is the only paste that works on my 2 babies. Desitin can&#x27;t even hold up to this. It cures a rash pronto!!</li>
    <li> Our son breaks out so easily with a diaper rash.  This is the only product we&#x27;ve found that helps alleviate and heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We find it most cost effective to by the 16oz containers verses the 4oz.  We&#x27;re very happy with the product and I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff really covers the skin and stays put.</li>
    <li> Maximum strength formula is better. There&#x27;s not enough zinc oxide in this one.</li>
    <li> Very pleased. Soft scent. Does exactly what it claims to and is gentle and easy to use.</li>
    <li> great item to have for any parent</li>
    <li> For my daughter it worked well when she was a baby. Yet for my son now ... it actually made his diaper rash worse and had to purchase something else.</li>
    <li> i chose it based on the reviews here. It really helps and my DD never had a diaper rash. Good big jar lasts for a couple of months.</li>
    <li> My 1-year-old has never had diaper rash, ever.  I tried a Desitin sample on our preemie, her first night home from the NICU; it was so sticky and messy, I put it aside and tried BBP.  We&#x27;ve used Boudreaux&#x27;s ever since, with every single diaper change.  Smells great, smooths onto skin much easier than Desitin.  This is truly a great product as a preventative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works great on adults - it soothed my dry, cracked elbows/hands during the winter.</li>
    <li> We use ointment every time we change our baby&#x27;s diaper (who turned 1 year old today!). She has only even had 2 diaper rashes because of this, but recently had a bad one. We used Desitin and it wasn&#x27;t seeming to do the trick. I looked online at how to cure diaper rashes, and among the other methods (bathe them, let them be naked, use wet towels/washcloths instead of wipes), it said to use a combination ointment, which combines both the zinc oxide and the petroleum jelly (aka, Butt Paste!). I put it on every time I changed her (and I changed her twice as often) and the diaper rash was drastically better the next day and gone by day 2. I will be buying a big tub because we already ran out of our little tube! I highly recommend it, even over Desitin! I have learned my lesson and will never stray again!</li>
    <li> BEST diaper rash cream around. Ships quickly (thankfully!) and item is as described.</li>
    <li> Great product ,I use this now with every diaper change on my baby to avoid rashes .She had rashes initially that&#x27;s why bought and tried this but rashes never again now.</li>
    <li> Must have for our changing station. Our baby came home a little red and so we started applying the paste at each change. I took less than a day for that to clear up. It worked so well we were able to skip a few days before the redness came back. It&#x27;s easy to use and smells okay. 16oz seems like over kill at this point, but the lid makes it easy to scoop some out and apply it. Get this before bringing baby home.</li>
    <li> Any time my daughter&#x27;s bottom is just a little bit raw all I have to do is put a little of Boudreax&#x27;s Butt Paste on and by the next diaper change it looks better. I tried using an organic brand and she screamed and screamed. We will stick with Butt Paste.</li>
    <li> We have been using Boudreauxs since our daughter was born, and she has never had a diaper rash (she is 9mos). We now only use it at night because she wears an overnight diaper for about 12 hours.</li>
    <li> this is the best product i have found to clear up my daughter&#x27;s diaper rash. i would recommend this product to everyone with a baby! it really works!!!</li>
    <li> One of the best drying agents for a bum that is too moist I prefer it over A&amp;D ointment. It works great to keep the rash away.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY thing that works for diaper rash for our sensitive girl!</li>
    <li> This stuff is my favorite for babies! Both of my older children (8 years old) had very sensitive skin and my daughter always had burns from her urine. This stuff was amazing for healing and comfort! I purchased this again for our little one coming this week. Considering we haven&#x27;t had a baby for 8 years and I still remember how awesome this product is, is saying something! Don&#x27;t waste your time trying other products, seriously!</li>
    <li> My newborn son loves this stuff.  Obviously he&#x27;s too young to know what&#x27;s going on but this stuff has helped clear up his diaper rash.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Possibly the best diaper rash cream out there. My LO has horrible diaper rashes, but they stopped since I started using this cream on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I started using it on my first grandson and now on my second one, the reason for the four stars is because it is expensive and amazon didn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; one that comes in a green tube or jar which I prefer.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the reviews and on advice of a friend.  So far is working to prevent diaper rash.  Every time my babies bottom gets red I treat with this and it is good right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every parent should get it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 Year Update:&lt;br /&gt;Still using the same jar, still works great.</li>
    <li> Not a diaper rash on our baby ever.&lt;br /&gt;Use this with every diaper change.&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s 10 months old and we&#x27;re still on the original 2 jars we bought way back when.&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, I love it, nice and thick!  This clears up diaper rash on my diaper overnight.</li>
    <li> An amazing product.  Heals almost instantly!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for babies and the elderly when needed.</li>
    <li> The only diaper cream, period.</li>
    <li> Happy with the price of the product, the best we could find around. Can&#x27;t really comment on how good it is to use yet as we haven&#x27;t used it yet. :)</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. Seriously.</li>
    <li> I think it works but it is so thick and pasty and goooy its a mess. Made me think of something you get at a hardware store and spackle walls with. Where ever you use it, you have to cover area afterwards or it will get everywhere.</li>
    <li> This works great if you use it right!  If you use it sparingly, it does nothing.  However, you need to apply generously.  Our pediatrician said, &amp;#34;Like icing on a cake&amp;#34;.  After we got that tip, we found this to be a miracle cream.  Has eliminated every single one of our child&#x27;s diaper rashes for 1.5 years and going strong.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used Boudreaux&#x27;s Butt Paste on both of our kids, and recommend it to anyone who asks.  Works wonders on even the toughest diaper rash.  The wide-mouth flip-top tub is a godsend when you&#x27;re dealing with a squirming baby and can&#x27;t use both hands to squeeze a tube.</li>
    <li> Works as expected , maybe a little too greasy</li>
    <li> Not sure how we will get it out when we get close to the bottom because of the depth of the container.  Will probably repot into another container as we get down there.  This stuff is the best as far as baby bottoms go though for protection and healing!  Better than A&amp;D regular or rash and Burts Bees cream to powder or Boudreaux&#x27;s natural paste.</li>
    <li> So worth the money to get a big tub of this for our baby. It lasts much longer and you get much more for your money.</li>
    <li> This was a life saver for us. This is the only product that worked on my baby&#x27;s irritated bottom (even healed the sores in just a day or so). We used all sorts of other zinc oxide products, but whatever this one has as a combo (a variety of oils, higher percentage of zinc oxide, you name it), worked much better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried. Highly recommend to all moms: once you try it, you&#x27;ll never go with anything else. In addition, the product has a very pleasant smell to it.</li>
    <li> Solid price for sure and we go through this stuff like crazy with a little sensitive bottom of a 1-yr-old.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff better than the standard Desitin because it doesn&#x27;t stink as much and it is much easier to wash off of your hands!!</li>
    <li> Used for an adult rash. It helped soothe upon contact without burning and healing was obvious within 24 hours of application.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s rashes clear up amazingly with this butt paste. She gets rashes at daycare, and when i bring her home, i would soother her with this, and the next diaper change, her rash would usually be gone. If it was a really bad rash, I would use the extra strength version after the first application of this stuff, and it would be gone shortly thereafter. The only downside is that I can&#x27;t use this product with cloth diapers. Other than that, its AMAZING!</li>
    <li> We haven&#x27;t seen even a hint of diaper rash since we started using this stuff. We use it after every change and for the price, it&#x27;s a huge value! We keep Desitin in her diaper bag because this is really impractical to carry around. We don&#x27;t use her diaper bag that much anyways. I feel like we&#x27;ve been using it forever and she might be a year old before we use the first tub we bought. Lol. Something to think about is, I can tell when we get low it will be hard to reach and we will probably end up with it on our hands. I think it&#x27;s worth it though, because of the value. It&#x27;s great, gentle stuff and I highly recommend. Our pediatrician actually recommended it.</li>
    <li> helps with his rash as he is bed bound prone for rash</li>
    <li> Of all products available, Butt Paste is the best! We would not have survived the last 2 year without it.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, very goopy and thick and seems to protect my little one&#x27;s bottom quite well. It&#x27;s hard to wash off your hands but it smells nice - kind of like sweet oats or like cookie dough?! When you get to the bottom of the jar it&#x27;s kind of hard to get out so I like the tube better.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few (only?) diaper creams I&#x27;ve found that works, but is gentle on my kids&#x27; sensitive skin.  Mine tend to get very sore, very quickly &amp; the white creams burn - they&#x27;ll cry if I put those on.  This one they don&#x27;t mind at all.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find a large tube of this so having it delivered to my door is great for us.</li>
    <li> The name says it all.  We use it on our 2 years olds butt all the time, and he never gets diaper rash.</li>
    <li> This product works well to prevent diaper rash.&lt;br /&gt;My son&#x27;s pediatrician recommended that we put rash cream on him during the night to prevent rashes.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 4 weeks and I seems to be doing the trick.&lt;br /&gt;I alternate between this and aloe vera gel.</li>
    <li> So this is great value for a great product.  My kids (I have twins) sometimes have diaper rash I think because I cloth diaper, and also they just poop a lot.  They are pretty great little eaters but I digress.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I love this stuff. or rather I would say my babies bums love this stuff.  If they get the slightest bit red, my regime is generally the following:&lt;br /&gt;- switch to disposables for the day&lt;br /&gt;- whenever they poop, I wash their bums off with water and soap&lt;br /&gt;- apply a thin layer of this butt paste (Point of advice: it doesn&#x27;t need to be on thick, thin works just as well, which makes this last even longer!)&lt;br /&gt;- put on the disposable diaper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I do that, even with the worst diaper rash it is gone in a day.  Fortunately they haven&#x27;t had diaper rash all that often so we literally still have almost the entire tub (even though we&#x27;ve had it for a year and even though we have twins).  I don&#x27;t know when this stuff expires, but definitely can be used for a long long time.</li>
    <li> This paste really works. It cleared up a pretty bad rash. After I give my daughter a bath, I can still see some of it on my daughter&#x27;s skin, though. That&#x27;s not a bad thing, but I thought I&#x27;d mention it. It does not matter because I usually put some more paste right back on her. I just wish I could get it through the Subscribe and Save store. :-)</li>
    <li> This diaper rash cream has been good at clearing up all rashes my daughter has had. I like desitin as well but the packaging on butt paste is better. The lid flips open along it easy to swipe out the cream while holding your child steady on the changing table. The consistency of the cream is thin and creamy which is KOVE because a little goes a long way. This tub lasts me several months and I use it after each diaper change. The smell is subtle but nice and the cor is a light brown.</li>
    <li> When I had a baby my friend gifted me a package of diapers and a jar of Boudreaux&#x27;s butt paste.  I smiled  politely and put away the butt paste, thinking to myself that anything with a naked, smiling cartoon of a baby couldn&#x27;t actually be taken seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward a couple of months and my baby was afflicted with the beginnings of a painful diaper rash.  I ransacked my bathroom cabinet, desperate for something - anything - to stop the raw, red dots threatening to erupt all over my beautiful baby&#x27;s backside.  I dug out the Boudreaux&#x27;s butt paste and smeared it all over the affected area (and some unaffected area - I sensed that the Boudreaux&#x27;s butt paste would &#x27;know where to go&#x27;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the next diaper change - yes, the NEXT diaper change - the red was looking less red (parents out there will understand what that means).  Within two diaper changes, the oncoming rash was a thing of a past.  The next morning my baby woke up with a smooth, clean tush (can I say that here?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called my friend and thanked her.  She said to just be sure and pass on a new jar to the next new mom.  #payitforward</li>
    <li> This stuff works better than anything else I&#x27;ve used to conquer diaper rash. I usually can see a difference within one or two diaper changes when using Boudreaux&#x27;s Butt Paste.</li>
    <li> I liked it and want to recommend how good it is to you so you will like it to. OK.</li>
    <li> Looks like this will help with diaper rashes.... protects and forms barrier so far so good!  Thanks for good price!</li>
    <li> The tub I bought for my son lasted past his first birthday. No signs of diaper rash. Doesn&#x27;t smell pleasant and its a thick paste, but it works well and beats a diaper rash any day/</li>
    <li> Butt Paste &amp; Extra Strength butt paste were the only things that&lt;br /&gt;finally helped resolve our daughters on again off again diaper rash.&lt;br /&gt;Once we implemented the extra strength then down-graded to the regular, no more diaper rash!&lt;br /&gt;Now we just use Aquafor for maintenance, but use the butt paste sometimes for overnight&lt;br /&gt;care, or if her tush looks even a little pink.</li>
    <li> I use this for prevention at night and for minor rashes. It has basic ingredients and no parabens or anything. It does not stay on as well as Desitin, but it soothes the skin and is a good overall cream. For more severe rashes the purple Desitin can&#x27;t be beat.  The tub is a better value than the tube.</li>
    <li> If you work a job where you&#x27;re soaked in sweat all day, sit for long periods of time (driving job/desk job), work in a wet bathing suit (beach job), or wear disposable underwear, you&#x27;ll want to use BOUDREAUX&#x27;S BUTT PASTE. It&#x27;s better than Desitin in my opinion, but I know of moms who use both at the changing table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You pronounce it Boo-Droe&#x27;s. It&#x27;s Cajun French. The X is silent and denotes it as a surname. It&#x27;s like the X makes it plural.</li>
    <li> I was forever tearing my bread while smearing this tasty sandwich spread before I though to try it on toast.  Fresh out of the toaster this paste spreads easy on my toast, bagels, and really seeps into all the nooks and crannies of an English muffin.  For a real treat mix it with a little strawberry jelly it tastes delightful but doesn&#x27;t ball up on the roof of you mouth nearly as much. This is my new goto breakfast on the run that really sticks with you all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a serious note this is the best stuff going for those red bottoms and works like no other product out I have found.  The tub gives you a lot more control over of how much to apply and as a result lasts and lasts compared to the tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also works wonders on chaffing for big people.</li>
    <li> this is the best diaper cream out there. we will not use anything else. my son has very sensitive skin and this is the only thing that works</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this butt paste works better than any other diaper rash cream out there and this jar will last me quite a while plus it was perfect for the price</li>
    <li> I wish they carried the maximum strength in the 16 oz jar. This is used as a preventive measure but I would really have liked the red container.</li>
    <li> Every parent I know owns about 5lbs of this stuff and swears up and down by it. If you&#x27;re childfree &amp; not sure what to get for a baby shower gift, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with Butt Paste.</li>
    <li> I only have to use this sparingly. My mom and mother-in-law are used to using a ton of Vaseline and/or baby powder, so they were both at me for not \\&quot;protecting my baby&#x27;s precious bottom.\\&quot; My baby class instructor told me baby powder can cause yeast infection and Vaseline prevents the skin from breathing (nothing goes in, nothing comes out). I heard about Butt Paste from a graduate couple and gave it a try. I just put on a thin layer where my baby&#x27;s butt is a little red and the redness will be gone by the next diaper change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually bought this from Walmart (same size). It&#x27;s HUGE and it&#x27;s going to last a really long time. You can buy smaller tubes but I thought I&#x27;d be paying the same price for less so I might as well get a big jar. I guess it depends on how often your baby&#x27;s butt gets red. For my baby, it&#x27;s like once every 1.5 week. Just a dab is enough for him. At this rate, I think I should&#x27;ve gotten the smaller tubes instead. BUT, this is a great deal if your baby&#x27;s bottom gets red often.</li>
    <li> I love BBP!  I started with Desitin, then moved to Aveeno, and finally decided to try BBP on a whim.  Turns out it&#x27;s by far the best preventative out there.  It doesn&#x27;t stick to your fingers and make them gross, but it creates a really clean barrier against moisture.  I never change my daughter diaper at night, which means 10 hours in a wet diaper (I know...) and she has yet to get diaper rash or any sort of irritation.  Try BBP, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> I love this cream! I wish I would have known about it sooner because my daughter suffered from a horrible diaper rash when she was 1 month old. I tried other &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;earth friendly&amp;#34; creams but all would cause her pain. This is the only rash cream that I have always been able to put on her that she won&#x27;t scream in pain. When I see her starting to have a diaper rash, I immediately dab it on and it goes away within the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: easy to use, spreads well, no odor, heals skin within a day, no pain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it does stain clothes if its not rinsed immediately</li>
    <li> This is the best cream I have ever used for diaper rash. It clears it up right away and if used as a preventative, rashes won&#x27;t even appear.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful for large breasted women. I am a D cup. In hot weather and during exercise I sweat under my breasts. Using deodorant can cause yeast infections so I went looking for for an alternative. Here it is! It works great, keeps me from chaffing, and I avoid potential yeast infections.</li>
    <li> Using this on my elderly Mom with her sore bottom. Works great</li>
    <li> This is our go to diaper rash cream. It can make rashes disappear overnight like magic and stays in place nicely.It does stain whites after a while, so if you use cloth diapers, this may be a deterrent. My number one choice for rashes is Aquaphor in the tub, but this works almost as good at about half the price.  A little goes a long way with this product, and one tub has lasted us about a year making this super cost effective.</li>
    <li> The best Butt Paste for your baby&#x27;s butt!  When the little one get a rash (usually heat related where we live) this is what we use to patch her up quickly and to lessen her pain. The smell is odd but not terribly unpleasant.</li>
    <li> I tried this cream once for now. It seems to do its job pretty good when it comes to rashes, but it&#x27;s very hard to clean. It did not come off using a wet napkin, so I had to give baby a bath.</li>
    <li> I like having butt paste in a big tub. We keep this in our diaper box at home (as opposed to our diaper bag on the go) and it&#x27;s nice. I wouldn&#x27;t want to carry this thing, though.</li>
    <li> This stuff is worth its weight in gold.  My wife and I are on constant diaper patrol with our newborn son.  Although we try to change diapers as soon as the little blue strip turns blue, or when we hear the baby farts...our little fella still got diaper rash.  We were given a small tube of this stuff at my wifes baby shower, and we&#x27;ve never had to try anything else.  As soon as we used it the first time I came on Amazon to find the 1lb jar.  You cant have enough of this stuff...</li>
    <li> Bourdeaux&#x27;s Butt Paste has been a life saver for my husband and I.  My little one is almost  a year old, and with consistent use of the butt paste he has only had diaper rash twice (both times when he was teething).  We started out with a tube that was given to us as a shower gift, but priced out the 16 oz jar and discovered this was the much cheaper option.  The jar also lasts forever!  We have been using our current jar since March, and it still has quite a bit left.  We use it 4-6 times a day, so it really has a generous amount of paste in it!</li>
    <li> used it on my son&#x27;s infected eczema, and I think he was surprised to see a rapid improvement overnight. love the scent.</li>
    <li> I use this during the day during frequent diaper changes. I do not use it at night as it comes off easily.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm.  Great price in a tub vs. a tube.  I would certainly purchase this product in the future.</li>
    <li> This stuff is excellent. We have been using it for years and years and years. My in laws live in Louisiana and knew about this stuff long before it became popular. The name is funny, the smell is interesting, the results of using this are perfect. I never regretted using this stuff on my babies&#x27; butts.</li>
    <li> We used this for our first child and it very quickly and effectively fixed any redness or diaper rash she ever had.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for my daughter since she was born and I love it! She never got a diaper rash once (of course, you also need to be good about timely changing the soiled diaper). It certainly will help but may not work wonders, as some people expect, when the rash is already there. But it definitely helps to prevent it.  Zinc is a great chemical to treat all kinds of skin conditions. I even tried using it on cold sores, and they healed so much better! I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> My family has been using this since our baby was born. It was recommended by my parents who used it on me as a child. My son is 2 now and has only had diaper rash one time, which is amazing because he regularly gets rashes on his arms and legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large size comes with enough paste to last roughly 3 months. Use it on every diaper change. Our friends with kids say bad diaper rash is hard to get rid of and causes unnecessary pain to the baby. When we changed daycares recently we noticed quickly that they were not using it regularly, because our son got a light diaper rash. When asked, the daycare attendant admitted that she would get in a hurry and not use the paste occasionally.</li>
    <li> If you ride bikes, you need the big tub of Boudreaux&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Perfect! and works so well. Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Something went wrong with this product. No more effective like it used to be...</li>
    <li> It is hard to apply! It just sticks to your fingers instead of the baby&#x27;s butt! Buy the tube of this paste. It will save you the headache. The paste itself is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Will last a long time not worth it to buy the tubes the jar is easy to store on your changing table and for us airheads not hard to lose like the tubes</li>
    <li> 3rd kid. Always used disitin before. Found this for #3 and I am sold. first 2 had some bad rashes. The kind that you clean their butts in the tub because wiping them made them cry. This kid, if the hinny gets red, I put on butt paste and presto! it&#x27;s gone! Also I like getting the $5 off $15 coupons for BB&amp;B and ByeByeBaby... Their coupons are interchangeable so a $16 tub is $11!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using this on our daughter since she was a week old, and now she is close to 6 months. No problem / no rashes so far, and her skin in that area seems quite healthy.</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s doctor / paediatrician recommended we use this when he got a diaper rash. It worked really well. It didn&#x27;t smell bad and it was easy to clean off when needed. I have the tube version as well but wanted something a little cheaper so got the tub. Now the tub stays at home by the main changing area and the tube stays in the diaper bag for on the go. This stuff is great!</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic! We have used it with almost every diaper change and have avoided a diaper rash for our 7 month old. I love this product!</li>
    <li> Not so bad. Suggest to go with smallest size to try and buy bigger if its suitable.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff, but I love the red packaged Maximum strength variety better. Both area great, but the red label max strength one works quicker.</li>
    <li> I love the size and the product but the &amp;#34;tub&amp;#34; always breaks on me!  One flailing toddler limb and this tub is history.</li>
    <li> It helped my babies diaper rash and also smells good, which is a plus. We tried A&amp;D but didn&#x27;t like the smell. The Jar is a good deal and the lid provides easy access with no waste of product.</li>
    <li> Keeps my baby happy. Enough said</li>
    <li> Being a graduate student in pharmaceutics, I&#x27;ve learned to look up studies on ingredients before using products with them. The American Association of Pediatrics recommended in 1960 that pediatricians avoid using boric acid and it&#x27;s use in hospital nurseries was discontinued then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Boric acid is known to present dangers to babies, but it is included in such products as Boudreaux&#x27;s Butt Paste (2). Nonfat dry milk and goat&#x27;s milk are inexplicably included in such products as The First Years Bottom Care Diaper Rash Relief System and Canus Li&#x27;l Goat&#x27;s Milk Ointment. Tea tree oil is found in Bum Boosa Bamboo Diaper Rash Ointment and California Baby Non-Burning &amp; Calming Diaper Area Wash. Although they also contain zinc oxide, miscellaneous plant ingredients are found in Aveeno Baby Soothing Relief Diaper Rash Cream, Aveeno Baby Organic Harvest Diaper Rash Cream, Balmex Diaper Rash Cream, and Puristics Baby Zinc Oxide Diaper Rash Cream (11).\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The link for this paragraph is on the uspharmacist website, but this isn&#x27;t letting me post the whole thing. If you copy and paste the above quote into google, you&#x27;ll be able to find the article about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream may work very well as others say, but you have to balance your benefits and risks to decide whether you want to use it. I used it before on my daughter until I read a few articles about the harmful effects of boric acid on infants. Then, I threw it away. If they decide to remove boric acid, I may try it again. Until then, NO WAY!</li>
    <li> Works as expected. I love boudreaux&#x27;s butt paste</li>
    <li> Nothing cleared up diaper rashes better on both my kids than Butt paste. It goes on thick and stays put. It&#x27;s unique odor and color can take getting used to though.</li>
    <li> We have used this on our 21 month old since he was born, it works really well.&lt;br /&gt;And you get twice as much for the price compared to normal retail.&lt;br /&gt;I even recently had a serious irritation on the inside of my thigh after a 29 hour straight road trip.&lt;br /&gt;I applied some of this the night we got home and it was almost completely cleared up by morning, I was really surprised.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works wonders.</li>
    <li> Love this product I think works better than balmex and just as well if not better than Dr smiths for less money. No weird chemical smell. Spreads on smooth and protects my child&#x27;s bottom well. No diaper rashes since using this product once I learned trick of patting bottom dry after using wet wipe before applying</li>
    <li> We never get rashes anymore! Yay! I wish it was less messy though</li>
    <li> Two kids and this is all we ever use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not partial to the smell (sweet smelling), and more importantly it didn&#x27;t seem to help our daughter&#x27;s rash at all. We had better luck with Triple Paste.</li>
    <li> My baby had horrible diaper rashes as an infant. I tried various creams on her but nothing worked. A friend suggested this paste. Her rash cleared up within a few days after using it! It&#x27;s all I use and recommend now.</li>
    <li> Love it. As soon as I started using it i really noticed a difference in my baby&#x27;s skin. Good product.</li>
    <li> Had to order this online since the military base doesn&#x27;t carry this product and it worked wonders on my daughters diaper rash.  I now use it here and there as a preventative measure and she hasn&#x27;t had any more issues with diaper rash.</li>
    <li> Older folks such as we are, have sensitive skin.  Even changing vitamins or enjoying orange juice can create an itch or rash anywhere, especially in the anus area. Your Butt Paste does the job. It is also good for hands and face.  Thank you for this good product.</li>
    <li> I was worried about the noxious medicine-y smell of most baby butt creams, Boudreaux&#x27;s Butt Paste really does have a pleasant scent. My daughter puts in on my granddaughter at every diaper change. It goes on smoothly and removing it is just as easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter likes it so much I just put in my 3rd order for it. it gets better, with Amazon Prime it is the best bargain. My father paid ten dollars at the grocery store for  a mere 4oz....this is 16. Better value, better price.</li>
    <li> Good size and price. Works great</li>
    <li> I have a 10 month old baby girl. About a month ago she developed a diaper rash. I began treating it, but it just got worse. That&#x27;s when I found a sample pack of Boudreaux&#x27;s. I figured it was worth a shot since my regular rash cream wasn&#x27;t doing the job. The rash began healing immediately, and by the next morning it was gone! I&#x27;m extremely impressed by the difference in performance between this and the other products I&#x27;ve tried. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough. I&#x27;ve used it once since when I saw some irritation begin, and the irritation had disappeared by the next diaper change so I know the first example wasn&#x27;t just luck or timing. Try this, you&#x27;ll be amazed.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very sensitive skin and even with diaper changes every hour still gets diaper rash. 2 days of butt pasting her and it&#x27;s totally gone. As long as I have kids in diapers, I will always have a supply in my house</li>
    <li> I recently had a bad allergic reaction on my leg to the plants in the back yard. The dermatologist was out of the aluminum acetate solution he usually uses for this type of allergic reaction (so I bought some from Amazon, but that is a different review) and instead he wrapped my leg with a bandage that was coated with a white paste. It worked great at reducing the irritation on my leg (a lot) so I researched it and found that it was 10% Zinc Oxide cream. My friend (a mother) told me, upon hearing my story) that she has used zinc oxide paste for her babies and they never got diaper rash. So I ordered Boudreaux&#x27;s Butt Paste and found that it worked so well, that my sin started healing better. I wrapped my leg in gauze after I coated the affected area with Boudreaux&#x27;s Butt Paste and sleep like a baby (yes, I had to use aluminum acetate eventually, but the Boudreaux&#x27;s Butt Paste allowed me to get better while I was waiting for the aluminum acetate to be shipped to me. I like Boudreaux&#x27;s Butt Paste 16 oz. Jar so much that I purchased an extra jar and put it in my first aid kit next to the aluminum acetate.</li>
    <li> I find this good for general maintenance during every diaper change. I slab on a good amount as a barrier for my 2 month old but if he starts looking a little tender I&#x27;ll use Burt&#x27;s Bees.  I find Butt Paste doesn&#x27;t work well on an actual rash but is definitely good if you just want to use something to keep baby&#x27;s skin protected from wetness.  And the stuff lasts forever!  Our tub isn&#x27;t even halfway gone and I&#x27;ve used it for almost every diaper change of the past 9 weeks.</li>
    <li> The name is a little much but that&#x27;s because the product is pretty intense as well. The butt paste is something that helps my baby after the worst soiled diapers and in cases of widespread, heavy diaper rash. It&#x27;s a pretty good deal for the size and price so that&#x27;s not much of a concern but it is so heavy that a small dime sized dab of it covers a big area on the little baby&#x27;s tushie so don&#x27;t go overboard. Too much paste is just going to cause more problems for you and your child...Work it in thoroughly and you should see soothing results pretty quickly which is nice when they&#x27;ve been screaming their head off for a few minutes already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst is when not only is your baby in pain, but you&#x27;re in pain too. Mother&#x27;s duties never end and we take a beating from our kids! Another essential I&#x27;ve learned to never live without in motherhood is nipple cream- [[ASIN:B00BMIX2XQ Motherlove Nipple Cream + FREE Aveeno Baby Daily Moisture Lotion Fragrance Free - 8 oz.]]. This stuff will save you plenty of agony if you use it after feedings. My baby&#x27;s lips seem to have an iron clad grip and by the end of a feeding, I&#x27;m sore, achey, and ready to throw in the towel. The Motherlove brand is great because it&#x27;s quick acting and safe after absorbing into your skin for the baby. The butt paste and nipple cream have become staples of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> After a horrible experience with heat rash in my nether region last year while in Thailand, I could find no product to provide relief. This year I gave Butt Paste a try.....AMAZING !!! An absolute godsend. I apply a thin film, and follow with powder, and I am good to go in 100 degree heat and high humidity. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Great product (max strength works wonders too). Love this with the flip top lid! So much easier than dealing with a screw top. Thanks for this option!</li>
    <li> its lasted all this time and we&#x27;re only half way. it has work wonders on my baby&#x27;s tush. noticed it took care of any redness over night. miracle paste ;)</li>
    <li> Love it never use anything else for my baby but this its awesome. It works like magic and heals what other pastes do right away</li>
    <li> Best diaper cream, and we tried them all!</li>
    <li> We tried Desitin but it didn&#x27;t work out on my newborn. This product were recommend by my mother who is a professional nanny/babysitter. She knows all stuff much better then anyone else. So I decided to buy a small tube first and see how it will affect my baby skin. And all rush is gone. So I ordered a big jar. Will be ordering again and again.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Love this brand. Product does what it says it will do. Lots of product for the money. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> This is much more cost effective than continuing to buy the little tubes. The flip top is easy to operate when you&#x27;re in the heat of the battle and have a squirmy baby going bonkers. Yes you have to dip your finger in and then spread that finger in the baby&#x27;s butt. With the tubes you can squirt it on, but you still have to use your fingers to spread it so it&#x27;s really no different in the long run. Baby doesn&#x27;t seem to mind the application and so far so good with preventing diaper rash.</li>
    <li> I have tried desitin, A&amp;D, and this product---  I mostly use this and the destine and am very happy with them both. no complaints!  love this value size tub for at home</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0009RF8G0 Boudreaux&#x27;s Butt Paste 16 oz. Jar]]Butt Past has improved the quality of my life. I am an 80 year old man. After 3 applications of Butt Past  - once in the morning, once at noon and once in the evening - my butt was as firm as the butt of a 19 year old Olympic figure skater. What had fallen was pushed back in placed and all the wrinkles had disappeared. The back pockets of my jeans area so tight I cannot get my hand in them and I no longer worry that when I get off the couch that my underwear will fall to the floor. Hootchy kootchy has improved as long as I keep my front side on the mattress. I want to try Butt Paste on my front side, but I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;d pop the buttons on my jeans. My only complaint is that my butt starts to sag after 24 hours. I am on a fixed income and have decided to do without my heart medication so I can have a constant supply of Butt Paste.</li>
    <li> This is, hands down, the best diaper rash cream that I&#x27;ve ever come across. If our boy gets a chapped butt, this clears it up. It is thicker and really coats and sticks to the area. Other creams are runny and ineffective. This stuff is a life saver.</li>
    <li> My wife excema and she states this works great for that.  Thank you Happy wife Happy Life :)</li>
    <li> This is excellent at not only helping after the diaper rash has formed, but can also be used for preventative purposes.  I love the large container and the lid is quite durable.  This is a very economic price and it is easier to use than the standard tube format.  I highly recommend this product and I rate it above the competition.</li>
    <li> Works great.  This thing has lasted 5 months now and it is only half empty.  I can&#x27;t imagine you would need more than two of these to get your baby from birth to out-of-diapers.  Our pediatrician recommended it and says it is in no way unsafe for baby.</li>
    <li> It is the only product the nursing home finds works well for my mother who is on hospice.  Glad you have it available.</li>
    <li> No more diaper rash for the little one.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST product out there hands down. Loved it so much I bought it for my brother whose baby had diaper rash.</li>
    <li> LOVEEEEEEE the flip top! Super convenient! And great price!</li>
    <li> Love this product and my sons teachers/daycare caretakers love the container. They have to wear gloves when changing diapers and they say this us much easier to manipulate than tubes, especially toward the end.</li>
    <li> I already prefer butt paste compared to the other diaper rash creams (goes on thick and cleans off easily....plus it improved my newborn son&#x27;s poor red butt) but its awfully nice in the tub. As always, Amazon did awesome getting it to me quick and nicely packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product July 2012, and I still have half a tub left. I use this product daily although not as often as I used to. Its now Jan. 2013 and I&#x27;m pleased with how long this stuff lasted. I will buy another tub when mine runs out because it definitely saved me bucks.</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks and every baby butt should benefit from it.</li>
    <li> not so much on the other. Long story short, it gave my sensitive skinned son a worse rash and burned like crazy during the application, but seemed to make a good difference for our thick skinned daughter.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was so sick of the smell of Desitin on my sweet little clean baby!!  This stuff smells much milder, and you can hardly smell it once he has a diaper and clothes on.  We only use this for preventative measures now though, because when a real rash breaks out, we can get it to clear up much quicker with Desitin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the large case though, and how it is a flip top instead of a screw on lid like the large case of Desitin has.</li>
    <li> Great product..and it smells good..like ginger bread.  It came quickly too and works very well. Thank you . My baby is feeling better.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It keeps my baby girls skin looking a healthy pink. No more irritation or diaper rashes. Worth any price to keep my baby happy and giggly.</li>
    <li> I know the name is silly and before I had my baby girl I always giggled when I saw it on friends&#x27; baby registries. After hearing them swear by this product though (and even switch from OTHER diaper creams) it definitely peaked my interest. Specifically when friends told me about how after using it their little ones&#x27; diaper rashes just disappeared. I have used it on my baby girl from day one and I can always tell a difference if someone forgets to put it on her during a diaper change because it&#x27;s the difference from having no redness when I go to change her, or her having a little redness. It&#x27;s a thick cream but comes off very easily (both baby&#x27;s bottom and your hands). It will leave a light tan color in the diaper, but that doesn&#x27;t matter. What matters is that it absolutely protects your baby, absorbs into their skin to keep it healthy, and is easy to put on and take off! I&#x27;ll never use another brand! I use this size at her changing table and the tubes in her diaper bag or at quick change spots in other areas of the house! The lid on this one pops up so you&#x27;re not having to unscrew a lid with one hand on the baby which I think is a very convenient aspect!</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff.  Works on babies&#x27; bottoms indeed.  However, this purchase was to cure jock itch after using some in the past to alleviate a touch of athletes&#x27; foot, I discovered that continued use completely eliminates the issue.  More often the application, the shorter the duration.  Great Product.</li>
    <li> The MIRACLE diaper rash cream!</li>
    <li> We use this every day on my 18 mo old, and it keeps his bum free of any redness. This is a huge tube - it&#x27;s lasted a few months already and we have half of it left.</li>
    <li> Smells better than other diaper creme, but doesn&#x27;t seem to really help diaper rash go away.  It probably helps diaper rash from occurring in the first place though.  It&#x27;s also the same color as breastfed baby poop, so if I take a quick peek to see if a diaper change is necessary, the answer is always yes.</li>
    <li> This product not only works the best out of any butt cream we have tried, but it also doesnt STINK like most products do. It barely has much of a scent at all, doesnt leave my hands smelling like I just changed a diaper, and it goes on smooth as opposed to sticky like some pastes/creams/ointments can. We have the Original, the Natural, and the Extra Strength... I would recommend the Original and the Extra Strength.</li>
    <li> Bourdeaux&#x27;s  hardly smells and doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all. It works great, I&#x27;ve only used 2 tubs in the last two years.</li>
    <li> this is the BEST product to cure diaper rash.  my little one had a diaper rash with wounds for 2 months!  i tried desitin, triple paste, earth mama and butt paste.  butt paste is the ONLY one that made a difference.  not only that, but in a few days, it cleared the rash right up.  i used the max strength initially and use this regular paste as daily maintenance.  great product</li>
    <li> Okay for daily prevention, but not good if actually if bottom is really red. Kinda smells also. Desitin is much better.</li>
    <li> I love Boudreaux&#x27;s paste. As long as we have been using it, our daughter has had no irritability or rashes. We use it after each diaper change and it makes economical sense to get the bigger size. While it is not as portable (and has an top which just opens up) as I would like, we leave it at home for all diaper changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend the product and based on the size, it is one of the more affordable pastes out there.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;d tried other products for baby problem areas and landed on this one. Very simple, no gimmicks. Only a few ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works really great, and does not irritate already sensitive problem skin areas on our infant.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this for my dry, cracking heels and toes.  This time of the year I walk barefooted alot and wear sandles and my heels get really dry.  My stepson who does wound care at a local hospital recommend this product.  After bathing I apply lotion, let it dry a few seconds then put Butt Paste on top, then I put on sox. I do this before watching TV or sitting at the computer to give it time to soak in. I&#x27;ve even slept in the sox after this treatment.  The Butt Paste holds in the moisture and after doing this maybe 6 times in 2 weeks my feet are totally soft and no more ugly cracked hees when I wear sandles.  No other foot care product I&#x27;ve tried has worked.  Butt Paste works.  I bought the big jar and this will last me more than a year.  BTW this would aslo work for dry cracked hands as well and baby&#x27;s butts.</li>
    <li> Best product for barrier cream for adults with incontinence.  Hospice recommended. Home care aides recommended. I just bought another bottle to bring to the rehab center for my father in law. Works better than the products they use.</li>
    <li> Best thing we have found for diaper rash. And this whole container lasted  us 14 months. Just ordered our 2nd one. Little goes a long way!!</li>
    <li> We tried other creams, and this is superior by far, hence buying a tub of it. Clears up diaper rashes quicker than other popular products out there. Smells good, easy to apply, baby seems to like the way it feels :)</li>
    <li> I usually try to go as naturally as possible for my little guy.  This was recommended to me by every mom I know. Save your baby from any discomfort, this stuff is magic!</li>
    <li> What can I say, as a seasoned mom I know this stuff works!  And it is much cheaper to buy it by the jar.  Depending on the rash I either use butt past or triple paste. They&#x27;re the best.</li>
    <li> The best diaper rash I tried. Really function its was the only work with my girl.</li>
    <li> I love the butt paste!  And so do my twins!</li>
    <li> Love the new easy to lift lid which makes a huge difference when changing diapers. Butt Paste is the best diaper cream, period. Great to prevent rash. I would recommend this to all parents.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an obese, high pitched man who has a problem cleaning this area on my own. I&#x27;m so glad I don&#x27;t have to ask my friend Joey to wash me anymore. Thank you butt paste</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the chance to test Desitin Original paste [[ASIN:B001E96MZI Desitin Maximum Strength Original Paste, 16 Ounce (Pack of 2)]] and Boudreax&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because they&#x27;re twins, I&#x27;ve done a fair anecdotal test applying Desitin Mark and Bourdreaux&#x27;s to Chris on the same day and Chris healed earlier.  When they had their next rash, I switched with Desitin to Chris and Mark&#x27;s Boudreax butt healed faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife hates me for doing that but I had to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desitin is a good product, and their paste is much better than what I think is their useless &#x27;cream&#x27;[[ASIN:B003DN1WJY Desitin Rapid Relief Creamy Jar, 16-Ounce]] but the ButtPaste is the better butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would discourage anyone from buying any Boudreax or any anti chafing cream while also buying condoms in the same transaction whether on Amazon or at WalMart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your credit card company will think differently of you, and your junk mail will change accordingly with announcements of new restaurants in Chelsea and the latest man leather accessories.</li>
    <li> Hands down, THE BEST DIAPER CREAM OUT THERE in my opinion!  I have two children under the age of 3, and have used butt paste on both of them since they were little.  I like the smell so much better than other brands and the thick consistency coats their bottoms and keeps them dry.  Diaper rash is gone within a day or two.  I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love this stuff and always buy it in bulk.</li>
    <li> Daughter has never had diaper rash because of this product.  Works wonders and has a nice scent to it, too.</li>
    <li> We use this for my son&#x27;s diaper rashes and it works!  Smells kind of funny, looks a little weird, but smear this on and the rash is gone the next day.  1 tub lasted us about 6 months.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product did not work for my daughter&#x27;s newborn skin as she required a stronger ointment to keep away diaper rash :o(. But I know some people who swear by this stuff, maybe it&#x27;ll work when she gets older and her skin is a little less sensitive.</li>
    <li> We love this butt paste.&lt;br /&gt;Near the end of the container, we use a spoon to get the contents out.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made in the USA. Yay!</li>
    <li> I really think this does a great job. My little girl has sensitive skin and she gets diaper rash often since I have stopped breastfeeding and this stuff really clears her up quickly. It cleans off easy which is nice when she has a rash.</li>
    <li> This tub is so much easier to use than a tube! Same great product, but way more convenient. I hope I don&#x27;t have to go back to tubes.</li>
    <li> Buttpaste never fails to clear up my sons diaper rash the same day. I&#x27;ve used so many other products and this is hands down the best.</li>
    <li> I love the name of this product: BUTT PASTE.  It really does heal  rash fast and even in adult cases.  As others said in reviews it is great for heals on feet or hands in general.  I have never broke out and feel great.  It&#x27;s a non greasy formula that everyone needs on their shelves.</li>
    <li> I love using this on my 3 month old son. It keeps his butt protected and has a nice scent to it. Its better to buy the 16 oz jar it lasts a lot longer that the tubes. I like that works for other skin problems besides diaper rash.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for babies to prevent diaper rash. We use it every diaper change!  We&#x27;ve tried their organic or natural version but it isn&#x27;t as effective.</li>
    <li> I got this on recommendation from a mother of two when we had our first little girl:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Smells much better than Desitin&lt;br /&gt;- Not greasy at all&lt;br /&gt;- Easy access container (easy open, easy close, wide mouth jar)&lt;br /&gt;- Prevents diaper rash effectively, and soothes other irritations when they pop up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- A little pricier than other options -- that aside -- no criticisms of this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get some -- its worth spending a little more to keep your little one from being uncomfortable and cranky!</li>
    <li> Best diaper cream! Nice and thick so it stays on the babies bottom! 3 months old and no diaper rash yet!</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic!  Our baby would get rashes using other creams &amp; powders, so we switched to the butt paste on a recommendation from friends.  She hasn&#x27;t had a diaper rash since, and that was 7 or 8 months ago now!!  It may not have the most appealing name (but you&#x27;ll learn to enjoy throwing the name around), but man does it work!</li>
    <li> One tub of this stuff will last until your baby is out of diapers.  Really the best diaper cream there is.  Buying the big tub is the best way to go. I was adverse to the idea of the big giant tub of diaper cream and kept buying tube after tube. Then I found a jar of this stuff on sale and bought it. I couldn&#x27;t believe how much longer the tub lasted.</li>
    <li> The texture of this butt paste is great. It&#x27;s not impossible to remove from my baby&#x27;s bottom at bath time like Desitin (which is what I was using before) and has a very pleasant scent (smells like cookie dough). The jar will last you a long time so it&#x27;s worth it the price (although Amazon&#x27;s price is not the lowest I&#x27;ve seen).</li>
    <li> This works very well. It has a pleasant smell, and creates a barrier that cleans up easily. It works for adults too!</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff! Takes diaper rash away quickly. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad like other diaper ointments. Love the big tub too.  Can&#x27;t use with my cloth diapers without a liner, but its worth it when LO has diaper rash.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! It helps keep diaper rash away, or heal up any outbreaks quickly. The 16 oz size is perfect for the changing table, but I keep smaller tubes in the diaper bag. It&#x27;s been hard to find the 16 oz size at any of the local stores, so I&#x27;m glad to be able to order on here for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells awful!!!  I&#x27;ve put it on her a few times and I just smell it on her all day when I do.  Of course my sense of smell is still heightened from pregnancy but even my husband notices the smell!  Baby girl hasn&#x27;t had diaper rash yet and doctor says to not put anything on her unless she does so I will be waiting to use this product until I need to!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this baby diaper cream. My baby had a bad rash. The kind that runs all over the bottom and makes them cry everytume you change a diaper. I tried a few creams till I finally used this one. I was concerned it might be too strong. I put some on and left him nappy- less. Did this for a day. Dramatic improvement in rash. And no discoloration of skin. Recommend it!</li>
    <li> my baby never has rashes in his diaper product is easy to use and works great I recommend to anyone with infant</li>
    <li> Whenever i use this on my baby butt i pray for the person who made it. This is such life saving thing. It helped my baby just in two days to get rid of diaper rash. I used so many types of ointment but this worked awesom.</li>
    <li> I have never had acne problems but about twice a year I will get a bad break out and I have tried almost every acne product on the market that I can afford but nothing ever seems to work fast enough. My sister works at a pediatrician&#x27;s office and suggested I try some Boudreaux&#x27;s Butt Paste so she brought home some samples for me to try and all I can say is wow, my acne cleared up within two days. This is an amazing product (not just for butts!)</li>
    <li> Cleared up baby&#x27;s butt rash within two days. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I use this product for my dry skin (elbows, knees, and hands get crazy dry in the winter.)  I only need to use this for a couple of days (once in the morning once at night) and my dry skin is healed up and not dry.&lt;br /&gt;I have used a ridiculous amount of products to try to heal my dry skin, and also I have very sensitive skin.  This is the only stuff that doesn&#x27;t sting, and fixes the issues right away.&lt;br /&gt;I also used it when I had a small bout of athlete&#x27;s foot.  It also helped with that...although I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for that if the athlete&#x27;s foot is widespread.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it is super greasy....gets all over clothes and fabrics even when you think you wiped it all in.</li>
    <li> Have given Boudreaux&#x27;s previously to expecting friends and colleagues. After they quit laughing the later feedback from them about the product has been positive.</li>
    <li> Will order again! Best creame we&#x27;ve tried!!</li>
    <li> My son is 9 months and we&#x27;ve had this since birth. He&#x27;s had small flare ups but nothing major until this week. I think he had a bug and the boy guy kept pooping all day for two days, leaving his little bum very raw. He was super red and you could see his blood capillaries along with a generally raw area. We took out the butt paste and used it after every diaper change and I can see a major improvement in two days. He&#x27;s still a tad bit red but nothing like it was the other day. I&#x27;m grateful this worked. I just bought two small tubes for daycare and a spare.</li>
    <li> This is the best butt paste around and it&#x27;s great for baby gifts! If someone doesn&#x27;t have a registry, this is the item that I will purchase every time. It lasts a long time too, so it is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent for elderly patients, wearing pull-ups or diapers.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST cream for diaper rashes.  My son tends to go to the bathroom numerous times a day and very often ends up with dipaer, because of that.  This is the only cream that helps immediately.  If he has a bad rash and I put this on him before bed, in the morning it&#x27;s almost completely gone.  This giant tub is also great, because it&#x27;s much cheaper to buy it this way.</li>
    <li> I used boudreaux&#x27;s butt paste from the first day I saw any sign of diaper rash until I started noticing these weird bumps that would form in the folds of my baby&#x27;s fat. A friend of mine said it might be yeast. I don&#x27;t know what it was, all I know is that it went away once I switched to Desitin. Having used both products here&#x27;s what my opinion is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Slides on smoothly and stays on&lt;br /&gt;- Prevents and cures diaper rash&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Messy (messier than desitin too)&lt;br /&gt;- Gets all over your hands and is hard to wash off (part of why it works so well keeping the skin protected I assume)&lt;br /&gt;- leaves weird bumps on my baby&#x27;s sensitive skin (looked almost like pimples or clogged pores)&lt;br /&gt;- must wipe it off every time you change the diaper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked desitin better because you don&#x27;t have to wipe it off every time, it is easier to put on, it&#x27;s not quite as messy, and it doesn&#x27;t give my baby weird bumps. Either way I do think this product is good and I use it when I run out of the other stuff, but I can&#x27;t use it too often or those stupid bumps come back.</li>
    <li> this is great!!! keeps baby&#x27;s skin from getting irritated. great product and nice smell</li>
    <li> Boudreaux&#x27;s Butt Paste is the best, and I haven&#x27;t found anything else with the same consistency.  It works great!  My son is 16 months old, and he has never had a diaper rash.  Thank you Boudreaux&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  It is excellent.  I was thrilled to find  it at Amazon.  Higly recommend.</li>
    <li> Even RN&#x27;s need to ask advice every now and then... on FB I asked my &amp;#34;friends&amp;#34; to please recommend that &amp;#34;ONE&amp;#34; product that they just couldn&#x27;t live without when it came to their babies.  A dear friend of mine has a child, who is now 12,  that is completely dependent and needs her Mom&#x27;s 24 hour care.  This friend said Boudreaux is the only diaper cream she would recommend.  How could I argue her experience - 12 years using all diaper creams and Boudreaux is her only pick.  I have used it now for 9 months and agree it&#x27;s the only one I will use too.</li>
    <li> I read that this product can be used for troublesome body acne.  I have been using for a few weeks and do see a decrease in the acne.</li>
    <li> This has saved my little one&#x27;s behind many times... literally. This is by far the best product I have found for diaper rash, it clears it right up.</li>
    <li> I have 3 kids and have tried a lot of different diaper ointments over the years. This one is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used because it actually works and works quickly. I won&#x27;t even use any other ointment. Someone bought me another brand of ointment for my baby shower; it sits there collecting dust while I use the dickens out of Boudreaux&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> only diaper rash cream i will use and I&#x27;m a mother of 5 boys! Put it on and rash is gone in less the a day! This is the best price I&#x27;ve come by!</li>
    <li> The best for babies. This really works and it&#x27;s has a very pleasant smell. It&#x27;s sticky but I don&#x27;t mind it because it works great for preventing and treating diaper rash.</li>
    <li> great diaper cream, the big packaging allows you to always have enough on hand to prevent that rash form even making an apprearance</li>
    <li> A+++ Service and Product!</li>
    <li> My daughter had a diaper rash that the A&amp;D zinc oxide cream would not heal. I started using Butt Paste after every diaper change and the rash was gone within 24 hours. I&#x27;m docking one star though because it is really hard to clean off of her bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I use buttpaste in conjunction with A&amp;D ointment and breastmilk and my baby&#x27;s bottom has never looked better!</li>
    <li> This clears up and prevents my baby&#x27;s diaper rash!! The best out there! We can&#x27;t live without it! A must have!</li>
    <li> This keeps my baby&#x27;s butt moisturized and smells good. Its a great size &amp; is lasting longer than the simple tube.</li>
    <li> I used a lot of different brands and this by FAR worked the best. It is incredible how fast it works.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great as a low strength diaper cream, meant for use with every diaper change. The flip top jar makes it really easy to apply, whereas tubes can be messy and require two hands. I have a four month old and i have barely made a dent in my tub, so 16 oz goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I like this a lot for a daily paste. Nice smell and works well.</li>
    <li> Tub was cracked when we received it.</li>
