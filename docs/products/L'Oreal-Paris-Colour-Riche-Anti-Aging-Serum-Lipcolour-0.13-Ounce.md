      <li>This has enough color to give you more than just nude but light enough to still be considered nude, if that makes any sense.</li>
      <li>Lipstick was very well packed.</li>
      <li>This is not the real thing.</li>
      <li>EXPECTATIONS WERE WAY TOO HIGH ON THIS ONE.</li>
      <li>The formula is not heavy or tacky, very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Very excited to find a natural looking lip color that doesn&#x27;t look fake or cake in the fine creases of my lip.</li>
      <li>and this lipstick gives them a natural color and stays on.</li>
      <li>Naturally Nude &amp;#34; and</li>
      <li>The Naturally Nude is just the right shade if you need a little bit of a darker lip color without looking to garrish.</li>
      <li>Not sheer, not heavy.</li>

    <li> When I ordered &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; that was what I expected.  This is pink.</li>
    <li> Bought this to keep my lips moist and protected at the beach. I love the color I chose (very natural) and it last and is very pretty on.</li>
    <li> I bought &amp;#34; Naturally Nude &amp;#34; and I like it very much and you can&#x27;t beat the price !!!&lt;br /&gt;$ 4.00 versus $9.99 at CVS !! I&#x27;m sold !!</li>
    <li> This is my my best color and I was happy to get it at a good price. Went to get more but missed the &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; price.</li>
    <li> This a beautiful nude pink color. It wears well on my dry lips. The formula is not heavy or tacky, very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I have a fair complexion and pretty full lips. Very excited to find a natural looking lip color that doesn&#x27;t look fake or cake in the fine creases of my lip. Wonderful lip shade that enhances your own lips, not paint them with some unnatural, sickly hue. I do need to reapply periodically but find me a lip stick you don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping!  Although called Nude it hints of a blush tone and looks beautiful on.  Great shine and non-drying on the lips.  I recommend this shade and vendor to all.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I couldn&#x27;t find the same lipstick in stores. This is not the real thing. Looks very cheap.</li>
    <li> I love this color, naturally nude; kind of a peachy pink nude. I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> I like this lipstick and especially love the color.</li>
    <li> I am using my husbands account. This is my absolute favorite nude lipstick! Most nude lipsticks that I have tried make me look chaulky and washed out. This has enough color to give you more than just nude but light enough to still be considered nude, if that makes any sense. It is similiar to the color pumkin pie by nyx that I have. It is very moursturizing to the lips and the staying power is great. Of course if I eat or drink I have to apply it again but I haven&#x27;t found a lipstick yet that I don&#x27;t have to do that so it&#x27;s ok. I would recommend this to anyone with any skin tone. I am fair skinned and I just love it!!! I have two of them and I will probably order more before they become unavailable!!!</li>
    <li> WHEN THE AD SAID &amp;#34;NATURALLY NUDE&amp;#34;, I EXPECTED A COLOR SIMILAR TO &amp;#34;NATURAL&amp;#34;, WHICH IS WHAT I WANTED...THIS IS MORE OF A LIGHT REDDISH COLOR....I&#x27;M NOT VERY HAPPY WITH IT, ESPECIALLY FOR THE PRICE I PAID. EXPECTATIONS WERE WAY TOO HIGH ON THIS ONE. I DON&#x27;T KNOW IF I TRUST BUYING ANOTHER FROM THE COLORS THEY SHOW????</li>
    <li> I so love this lipstick. Just a fantastic nuetral color for my fair skin but brightens my face. Devastated to find out that it was discontinued after I&#x27;d just found this color. What an awesome surprise to find I could get it on amazon at an awesome price.</li>
    <li> I had to shop Amazon for a favorite lip color. I love this product but they must have discontinued it as I cannot find it anywhere in my local stores.  The Naturally Nude is just the right shade if you need a little bit of a darker lip color without looking to garrish. The anit-aging serum doesn&#x27;t hurt either, gives my lips a boost.</li>
    <li> I love how fast this arrived to me and it works great I notice the difference on my lips its more smoother.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the perfect shade, and it looks so natural! It matches my color, fills in well and gives me a little shine. And sometimes I put it on instead of balm, because it goes on so smoothly. (I also ordered another brand which, by comparison, goes on like chalk and leaves disgusting little stripes all over my lips.)</li>
    <li> Lipstick was very well packed. very nice quality, as well as all production L&#x27;oreal. Very natural color, a little pearl. This color is very suitable for light skin. I am happy with the purchase. Recommend to all.</li>
    <li> This is a much more orangy color than I thought it would be...&lt;br /&gt;Nice lipstick.. Not sheer, not heavy. Seems to provide good moisture.</li>
    <li> I have pale lips and this lipstick gives them a natural color and stays on. Also, no stickiness.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I did not like this color at all... looked like a weird brown color, not nude. I will not buy again.</li>
