<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this stuff and super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I really like this cuticle oil and it&#x27;s packaged really well to travel with me in purse everywhere. I was pleasantly surprised by its nice smelling fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have not found this to be helpful and I have been using it faithfully for 2 weeks.  It is not oily which is why I purchased it but I still have rough cuticles and hangnails.  The product does go on easily and as I said not oily which is a positive.  Just not at all strong enough to do the job.</li>
    <li> I usually use solar oil cuticle oil but wanted to try this because of its portability. I love being able to carry this in my purse and also bag for work. Easy to apply with the brush, non-greasy and great soft scent. I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days but I&#x27;m sold so far. I still love the almond scent and the results of solar oil a bit more but this is the one I will carry with me during the day.</li>
    <li> This is really good cuticle oil. Smells good and is almost like a gel conistancy so it isn&#x27;t runny. You can&#x27;t beat the price. Kept one and gave one to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for years it&#x27;s amazing . I put it on every night !</li>
    <li> This is the same stuff that is sold in a nail polish bottle, only it&#x27;s packaged in a pen for portability.  This stuff is wonderful! It isn&#x27;t greasy, goes on easily with the applicator tip (a little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t squeeze too hard!), and has a lovely soft fragrance.  I use it every night on my fingertips and toes and it helps to combat rough cuticles and hangnails.  I wish I&#x27;d discovered it sooner.</li>
    <li> I loved this cuticle oil, I love all OPI products which is why I tried this, I love the brush applicator and seems to do a very good job of softening the cuticles. My shipment was super slow, but the product was A+</li>
    <li> This OPI cuticle oil is wonderful! It feels so good on your cuticles and fingertips. It has does a really good job on my cuticles even though I don&#x27;t use it as often as I should.&lt;br /&gt;This is not my first time as a buyer...I do really love this product.</li>
    <li> It really works and I am delighted with this product.</li>
    <li> I love the OPI Avoplex Cuticle Oil! It goes on smooth and helps to make my cuticles so soft! Will purchase again</li>
    <li> I bought this product because a friend recommended it.  It is great!  Even in the middle of winter, I was able to pull this out of my bag, apply, and my cuticles would look like I just got a manicure.</li>
    <li> This item came on time . I just love having this in my purse , it is handy and easy to use when your away from home or traveling and your cuticles get dry! Great product!</li>
    <li> I have really dry, rough cuticles and love this product! I have also used the OPI  oil in the bottle but find the thickness of this product a bonus. The product gives many applications despite the small size and is perfect for carrying in your purse or makeup bag. Now that I&#x27;m regularly getting the long lasting shellac type polishes at my local nail salon, the oil allows me to keep my cuticles nice enough to avoid having a full manicure when I get my nails redone, saving me a bit of money at the salon and allowing me to justify the expense of nice looking nails. I have to admit i was stumped by another reviewer commenting that they find it drying.</li>
    <li> You can feel it making your cuticles better as soon as you put it on.  It will make your cuticles and nails healthier.</li>
    <li> I bought O.P.I. products because I love It.&lt;br /&gt;O.P.I. helps me to fix my dry finger and make my finger soft.&lt;br /&gt;It also smells good.</li>
    <li> It is good for your nail, take it.</li>
    <li> I have been ordered them for many times.  Really good for your cuticle. Love them.  Will order them again once I am out of stock.</li>
    <li> Great product, saved my cuticles this winter!</li>
    <li> I took a chance and ordered this product although a previous reviewer had said that the cuticle oil was not \\&quot;lightly scented\\&quot;.  My bad! The product has a very strong, sweet odor and it was so strong that I had to use a nail scrubbing brush and soap to remove the smell from the two nails I applied it to.  I had to throw the product in the trash and I wasted money unnecessarily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product description for this item should read \\&quot;highly scented\\&quot;, not \\&quot;lightly scented\\&quot;. While I understand that everyone&#x27;s perception of scent is different, it shoud be possible to create a scale that helps to guide Amazon&#x27;s customers. This would be most helpful to anyone who does not want to wear several strong scents simultanelously, but especially to those of us with senstive skin or allergies to perfumes.</li>
    <li> This is the best product ever to treat splitting nails and ragged cuticles. My hairdresser told me to apply it every night to nals and cuticles. It works..right away nails look soft and smooth, and grow in strong with no splits, but must be used daily to nourish new growth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the cuticle oil and glad it came in a 2 pack.</li>
    <li> Really good product for cuticles.  I use weekly and in winter even more often.  Keeps the cuticles soft and keeps them from tearing.  I like the travel size.  It seals well and I keep in my purse and have never had a leak.</li>
    <li> it is fit-size so I can bring it to my bag and take outdoor. And the smell is also good.</li>
    <li> It is really great thing to protect our nails. I love it andI will buy it again. Cool cool cool.</li>
    <li> Lives up to its reputation. Moisturizes and helps control cuticles. This is perfect for traveling because of its tiny size.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on the fence about this product.  So I&#x27;ll get right to it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Comes in the perfect size container to carry around, even in a small clutch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Hard to distribute a light layer... either none or too much is more likely&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t seem to be making that much of a difference in my cuticle health</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different cuticle oils and this one is by far the best. I only need to apply it once a day. I wash my hands frequently at work and my cuticles get incredibly dry and flaky. After putting this on at night before going to bed, this is no longer an issue. I love the smell; it&#x27;s light and slightly fruity. Other oils I&#x27;ve tried (from The Body Shop,Sephora) are three times more expensive and supply half as much product. And OPI&#x27;s Avoplex performs much better!  I&#x27;m hooked for life!</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. I wash my hands several times a day, and in the colder months my cuticles dry up pretty badly. This brings my nails to life. It is the perfect oil/gel consistency. I work in an office setting, and this product isn&#x27;t so oily that it runs and after rubbing it in fairly well I don&#x27;t have to worry about staining papers. I love the packaging. I carry it in my tote bag or purse.</li>
    <li> This fits so well in my purse. I use it about once or twice a week on my cuticles and it actually makes a difference. It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; it but it keeps my cuticles from drying out. I am definitely going to continue to use this product, probably forever.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Made my dry cuticles soft and they look so much better now! OPI is the best by far.</li>
    <li> Good, quick service!!</li>
    <li> Fits in scrub Ana pants pocket</li>
    <li> Love it, I don&#x27;t know how did I live before without using this product, the amount is small but since you apply just a little bit to each nail, it lasts forever!</li>
    <li> Terrible. The product seems out of date. The oil came out of the tube once and smelled odd. It now has congealed and no longer works. I think this has been in the back of a warehouse in some other country.</li>
    <li> Very nice to go version</li>
    <li> Easy to use, though sometimes it is hard to get the right amount to squeeze out.  Worth the money to keep your cuticles moisturized.</li>
    <li> The stuff is actually really great, however, it tends to turn from an oil to a gel form and a lot is usually wasted that way.</li>
    <li> This stuf works great easy to apply and soaks in fast. You can apply it anywhere. It&#x27;s so great that two other  people I know wanted them too!</li>
    <li> I have used OPI for some time and think it a good product and this was a very good price for me and a very good delivery</li>
    <li> Friends recommended products, did not let me down. Reasonable design, easy to use, smells good news, my friends and I are very satisfied. Easy to carry, the effect is simply beyond my expectations. I really like this product.</li>
    <li> I am a long time  user of opi&#x27;s avoplex oil and love the fact that I can have one stashed in my purse or on my end table or in the kitchen to use all the time, and the price is really great..</li>
    <li> This cuticle oil is very moisturizing. It&#x27;s my favorite. Used to buy at Sephora but they stopped carrying it. Glad I could find it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Good oil for my dry cuticles year round but especially in winter.  I brush a little around the nail on each finger then massage it in a bit and add my hand cream all over hands.  Doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue.</li>
    <li> Sorry but this stuff smells so strong a person across the room from you can smell it. I am not usually scent-sensitive but this oil is way over the top. Too bad as it&#x27;s not a bad product otherwise.</li>
    <li> This oil has really helped my dry cuticles.</li>
    <li> great product. it really makes the differnce!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have icky cuticles without it, and when I use it, it is just like I got a fresh manicure. Also very good for carrying with you in your purse.</li>
    <li> I have used this cuticle oil formula for a while and it works great.  The on-the-go tube is a plus.</li>
    <li> This is so good to protect your nail and dry skin.</li>
    <li> I bought a home system to apply shellac nail polish and discovered I needed to apply  cuticle oil to increase the lifespan of my manicures.  I initially bought OPI&#x27;s cuticle oil which kept my cuticles soft and manicures lasting longer without chipping.  I loved the product but the containers tended to leak if placed in a purse.  This solved that problem.  The gel is just as effective, easy to apply, plus it doesn&#x27;t leak.  The small tube fits in purses/clipboards so easy to keep some handy.  It does have an odor but it isn&#x27;t unpleasant or overpowering as other reviewers state.  My husband is very sensitive to odors and he has NEVER commented or complained when I use this product near him, even while in a small car.  Purchased through Amazon with Prime shipping.  Arrived quickly in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I love it and use it every day!  Though it is a small tube, it will last a long time.  People have said it has a strong odor but I don&#x27;t think it does at all.  I didn&#x27;t order through Amazon but have the exact same stuff and the scent is really light.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and the little brush on the end. Makes it easier to apply and less mess from over applying.</li>
    <li> This product works very well. It is also convenient, as you can carry it in your purse. If you purchase from amazon , it is the best deal vs. in-store. CAB from New Jersey</li>
    <li> I have hard nails, but they peel. I also have a cleaning business which is never good for nails. I normally use the bottle of oil from OPI. I was even taking one to work, but it was messy. I love this tube of oil! Can put it in my bag or purse with no mess! It&#x27;s nice just to be able to break out whenever for a quick nail oiling. I have been using this product for at least 15 years. If I stop for awhile, back to peeling. I use before bed and once during the day. Really helps to keep dry nails nice and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Dry cuticles in between manicures and from doing housework - gone with these. Slightly oily but the trick is to apply to cuticles round about bed time or when you know your hands wont be getting wet for sometime. Then rub hands to get rid of excess oil. Lasts through one or two hand-washings after that. No more bleeding cuticles for me.</li>
    <li> Nice travel size cuticle oil, exactly what i was looking for to put in my purse and travel bag, Thanks</li>
    <li> This item is the best....glad I made the purchase</li>
    <li> This cuticle oil is fantastic especially in the winter when the air is dry. The &amp;#34;To Go&amp;#34; dispenser is the perfect size to keep in your purse.</li>
    <li> I cant say it does moisturize your cuticles,  maybe its personal but I feel cream-ish kinds of moisturizers do better. Extra star - for convenience of packaging , and one for nice smell. Otherwise I&#x27;d give it 2</li>
    <li> I like this one more than The one from Bliss and other brands I owned.  I keep one in my purse all the time.</li>
    <li> got this bc someone on the internet said works really good,and i got it ,this one does nothing for me</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cuticle oil from OPI before &amp; I&#x27;m SOLD. A little dab&#x27;ll do ya, so it lasts forever. I definately recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  It is a fantastic product!  I will order this again.  The are tiny purse size.</li>
    <li> wife has used before.</li>
    <li> I only have to use this product a couple times to start seeing results. I personally think it works better than their cuticle oil that comes in a bottle. I just wish I could get a bigger tube of the To Go.</li>
    <li> Stays on pretty well, does soften the cuticle well and so easy to carry around.  I put one at work and one at home.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and helps keep cuticles in shape.  I&#x27;m pretty hard on my hands, and this stuff seems to work the best--and I&#x27;ve tried lots!</li>
    <li> As I have been using this product a long time, It was what I expected. I recommend it to everybody.</li>
    <li> I love this OPI nail oil. In the tube shape, it is easy to carry out. And it keeps my finger nail out of dry.</li>
    <li> I keep this with me everywhere I go and when I notice rough skin around my nails, this tube saves me from looking unpolished on that last day or 2 before a manicure.</li>
    <li> This product is my favorite. I love coloring and decorating my nails, so cuticle oil is kinda essential thing for me. This is very easy to use and smell&#x27;s great. Also, perfect size for your small cosmetic bag. Love it.</li>
    <li> I use this all of the time to keep my nails looking healthly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and not messy. Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR YEARS - CARRY ONE IN MY PURSE ALL THE TIME SO ANYTIME MY CUTICLES LOOK DRY I CAN TOUCH THEM UP - EVEN TRIED TO GET MY NAIL SHOP TO CARRY AND SELL BUT THEY WEREN&#x27;T INTERESETED - THEIR LOSS</li>
    <li> This time it is not as thick as the ones I used (identical products, just different sellers)</li>
    <li> This oil is easy to apply and stays on well. I like applying it in the evening, and letting it absorb while I&#x27;m reading. It is closer to a gel consistency, rather than an oil.</li>
    <li> Got these because I thought a brush tip would make applying cuticle oil easy and mess free. When I squeeze the tube the oil glops out and applies unevenly. Smells nice, but I&#x27;m going back to Burt&#x27;s bees lemon butter.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use, and it helps keep the cuticles moist, and it smells nice and it doesn&#x27;t leave a mess in my handbag.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I bought two, one to keep at my desk and one for home use. It made my cuticles look 100% better. I have horrible cuticles to begin with, they crack and peel easily. This made it smooth and prevented further cracking.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it! Two winter ago I moved to a place where we have hard water and all my nails broke and kept chipping.They refused to grow! I couldn&#x27;t believe it because my nails never break. I bought this and use it constantly for a while. My nails literally grew back in about two months time. I use this all the time now. And of-course don&#x27;t forget your nail &amp; hair vitamins...</li>
    <li> Great value and great product.  2 for the price of 1!  Great for stocking stuffer for my Wife.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I love the avoplex products in general, but this oil to go is an essential in my bag since I do my nails 2 or 3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not exactly mess free, I would not recommend to apply it before using your computer or work with papers since the product is not 100% absorbed by the cuticle. But if you carry a little handkerchief with you, you can apply it when you&#x27;re driving, or on the bus/train, leave for 10 minutes, wipe the excess of and voilà, moisturized and gorgeous cuticle :)</li>
    <li> Convenient and gets the job done! A lot goes a long way. I keep it handy for touch ups after I wash my hands throughout the day but find that I don&#x27;t need it. One use in the morning is just enough! Love this stuff!</li>
