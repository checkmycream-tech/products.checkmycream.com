<ol>
      <li>Inexpensive and great working product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love!!</li>
      <li>Very easy to use!</li>
      <li>a really bright one.</li>
      <li>but the light is very bright on it and helps accelerate whitening your teeth.</li>
      <li>Would be nice to know how to use this didn&#x27;t come with and directions</li>
      <li>Inexpensive and effective combo.</li>
      <li>Perhaps from water getting into it but other then that, great transaction, great product and great service.</li>
      <li>We are pleased with this purchase.</li>
      <li>but i&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s just a placebo thing.</li>
      <li>The price was right to try it and it is easy to hold in your mouth while you go about your business.  </li>
      <li>This item is ok you can feel the gel that your using with this really work</li>
      <li>but it would be nice if the light was a little stronger.</li>
      <li>Ive changed batteries and the light seems to still be very dim.</li>
      <li>White strips work better.</li>
      <li>Its just a blue light thats</li>
      <li>this is just a blue light.</li>
      <li>not only does my light not work, i didnt get the gel whitener with it as one would assume.</li>
      <li>but it really speeds up the process.</li>
      <li>This product came fast.</li>
      <li>you get blinded by the blue light, and your teeth look brighter.</li>
      <li>This teeth whitener light maybe small and easy to use</li>
      <li>Was exactly what I was looking for to replace my old one!</li>
      <li>and it comes in a clear  jewelry bag not even wrapped in a box.</li>
      <li>Waste of money, light is somewhat strong but the gel that it recommends to come with burns your mouth, the button that turns it on you have to hold it down to keep the light on really dumb</li>

    <li> Love!! Was exactly what I was looking for to replace my old one!</li>
    <li> Love the product however it seems to go bad after a few months of use. Ive changed batteries and the light seems to still be very dim. Perhaps from water getting into it but other then that, great transaction, great product and great service.</li>
    <li> This teeth whitener light maybe small and easy to use but the light is very bright on it and helps accelerate whitening your teeth. Very easy to use!</li>
    <li> Purchased one of these for myself and one for my hubby.  We are not sure if it accelerates the lightening process but it can&#x27;t hurt and it might speed it up.  The price was right to try it and it is easy to hold in your mouth while you go about your business.  This is to be used with whitening gel (not by itself).  We are pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product! Waste of money, light is somewhat strong but the gel that it recommends to come with burns your mouth, the button that turns it on you have to hold it down to keep the light on really dumb</li>
    <li> This item is ok you can feel the gel that your using with this really work but it would be nice if the light was a little stronger.</li>
    <li> not only does my light not work, i didnt get the gel whitener with it as one would assume. not satisfied. and it comes in a clear  jewelry bag not even wrapped in a box.</li>
    <li> Its just a blue light thats it DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> Small and convenient to use. Like that I can hold it in my mouth and continue to do things around the house.</li>
    <li> My teeth have brightened eighty percent due to this product in concert with the peroxide gel. Inexpensive and effective combo.</li>
    <li> The 2 little tubes of gel didnt work and they were completely dry. Wasted money on this.Dont buy this.product.White strips work better.</li>
    <li> this is just a blue light. a really bright one. but i&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s just a placebo thing. you get blinded by the blue light, and your teeth look brighter. 10 minutes later, no difference.</li>
    <li> Doesnt even turn on and seems like the batteries were dead when i got them. Pretty pointless. i would not recommend this to a friend</li>
    <li> Would be nice to know how to use this didn&#x27;t come with and directions so I&#x27;m not sure weather to use while whitening or after</li>
    <li> This product came fast. No instructions came with this product. I have no idea how long or how often to use this item.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and great working product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I read other reviews and seems people forget to remove the plastic from the batteries.</li>
    <li> you have to keep using it with your teeth whitener you already have but it really speeds up the process.</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money. It&#x27;s a rip off and doesn&#x27;t work at all. Don&#x27;t buy this. Save your money.</li>
    <li> i dont use it everyday but i can see the diffrence little by little!!!!! fits in my purse and you cant beat the price thank you</li>
