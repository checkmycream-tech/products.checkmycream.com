      <li>I recommend for anyone wanted to keep their nails nice and manicured these strips in combination with the gelish</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a manicurist and always want to have nice looking nails.</li>

      <li>I think they are going to outlast my top coat.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Easy to use. Stick on tips, file off ends, apply clear coat and done!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t chip very much, but it will take time to learn to apply it right. I kept getting mine off center and it looked a little silly, but practice will fix that.</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t for me. Not too difficult to apply but peeled off too easily.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite.</li>
    <li> i WISH i would have found out about these along time ago.....they are easy to apply, stays on a long time (if you triple coat or use gel instead of polish) and very quick to apply!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will NEVER go to a salon again!</li>
    <li> Work great! Mine last about 3 wks. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> When applied correctly, these last for weeks. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> These are awesome!  Little difficulty first one but after that it was easy!  They are durable (they&#x27;ve survived my afternoon tasks which is more than I can say for my last salon manicure!) and look fantastic.  I will be ordering these again and this is my favorite look for my nails!</li>
    <li> I was not sure I was going to like this product, but I youtube the correct way to use this product and I think visually it turned out well. I thought I was ordering pink and white tip, but it was just the white tip. Still very happy. Will probably do my own nails for my wedding day!!</li>
    <li> My sheer joy over these things is truly embarrassing. I can&#x27;t believe such awesomeness exists. I have NO patience and NO talent with my hands. These little buggers are so forgiving and they look incredible. Oh, and I am terrible to my hands and these hold up better than any nail polish I&#x27;ve ever worn. These might have changed my life just a little bit. :)</li>
    <li> The Incoco French Manicure, white cloud, tips are amazing.  It takes me less than five minutes to apply the tips.  One the tips are applied, I simply apply two coats of clear nail polish.  Then...my nails look absolutely flawless.  The bonus is that the tips/polish lasts about three weeks.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to have a well groomed, clean looking nail!  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> First off let me start by saying I tried this dry nail polish three months ago and hated it.  It was messy and chipped right away.  I know tons of people who use and love it so I decided to try it again.  This time following instructions left on these review and watching a youtube instructional video.  I suggest the vidco by LePooke - Inoco French Manicure.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this only 4 stars because the instructions are so poor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I did:&lt;br /&gt;First off - buff and then use nailpolish remover on nails to assure a flat clean surface.&lt;br /&gt;Find the closest size to your nail (bigger can be trimmed, smaller can be stretched)&lt;br /&gt;Warm the strip up by either blow trying them very briefly or simply rubbing it in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;Remove the clear plastic protective film, then tear from the second tab (which is your other tip).&lt;br /&gt;Fit the adhesive side up to your nail (remove and replace a few times until it is perfect.  It is really forgiving.)  If it doesn&#x27;t quite fit - stretch it a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Once you&#x27;ve got it where you want it, press it firmly onto your nail smoothing out any creases.&lt;br /&gt;Fold the extra amount over your nail, creasing it and gently tear it along the crease.  Any extra over or on the side of the nail can be removed with the file supplied but I would suggest filing over the nail toward the inside of your hand instead of across the nail like the instuction shows.&lt;br /&gt;Depending on how long your nails are, you can use the leftover amount on another nail, simply shape it with the orange stick provided.&lt;br /&gt;Cover it with a top coat and viola.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the shiny strip that is inside the package is a sticker that you can use to reseal the leftover tips in the package to keep them good.&lt;br /&gt;I will update later on how long this has lasted for me.</li>
    <li> I really like this product because I can do my own nails at home, and they last a lot longer than painted on french manicures.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the gelish gel nails set to do my nails at home.  I have also purchased the french manicure gelish kit and it is so hard to do on yourself.  I have been looking for an easy alternative to doing french manicures under the gel nails.  I ordered these hoping they would look great and they look like my nails were professionally done!  I placed these on first, then did my gelish base and top coat and they look so SOOOO good!!! I have only had them on for 2 days and have gotten so many compliments and people simply cannot believe these are my own nails and I did them myself!  The gelish lasts about 2 weeks so I know these are well protected and will last the same.  I work in the medical field and wash my hands about 40 times a day as well and they still last that long!  I recommend for anyone wanted to keep their nails nice and manicured these strips in combination with the gelish look fabulous!!!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for...Jamberry products are much better.</li>
    <li> Not great for shorter nails</li>
    <li> These tips started chipping off the day after the night I put them on. I used a very good top coat, too. No difference. I would NEVER get them again. Too bad. I had high hopes.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than a professional manicure, but I say even better. They last longer and are easy to use. Have some on my toes right now that have been on for a month and look great. Just trim the nails. I use a variety of the tips and am going to put some more on this afternoon. I highly recommend these. The Incoco web site has more of a variety.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use looks great! I like the nail size options very realistic. I like a thicker streak of a french manicure it was very easy to achieve with this product. I am obsessed with the French manicure look so I have tried many things out on the market and I must say I am pleased and just ordered 4 more sets!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands &amp; nothing can compare to these French tips. I  Absolutely love these tips. Add some gloss &amp; they seem fresh out the salon!!!</li>
    <li> UPDATED 2/16/15  These are perfect with the Gelish system!  Let me say that I am officially converted from traditional polishes to Incoco nail appliqués. I tried the strips with regular nail polish as I mentioned previously, and that worked well. But using the strips with the Gelish system is a dream. I purchased USpicy® DIAMANT Nail Dryer which is a UV/LED lamp (24 W) and it works well so far. Another reviewer of this product turned me on to Gelish and I am eternally grateful. I followed her guidelines and incorporated a few of my own, as follows:  1. Lightly buffed nails with an emory board  2. Used 100% Acetone polish remover (Used in place of the PH bond. I ordered the Gelish PH bond, but it didn&#x27;t arrive at the time I received everything else).  3. Incoco strips applied to dry clean nails- 5 to 7 minutes  4. Gelish Base Coat - cure two minutes  5. Gelish French manicure pink gel polish - cure two minutes  6. Gelish Top Coat - cure two minutes  Steps 4 through 6 were repeated for the other hand. If a large enough nail dryer is purchased, the time for this process can be cut in half!  (Curing times may vary due to the wattage of the UV lamp)  And Done!  The whole process took 25 to 30 minutes, tops.  A look for less that potentially can last up to three weeks!!! A no brainer.  Dec 25th 2014  I wish the Incoco French Manicure White Cloud Strips received a perfect five star rating. I say this because as long as this product is on the market, I&#x27;ll never go back to gel nails, acrylic nails or get a basic salon French manicure again! And I say this sincerely, as a legit customer who has a zero monetary stake in this company. I just happen to love this product very much and regard it as the best in the market as it relates to the French Manicure, (which in my book is the best nail design!!!) I applied the tips on clean, dry nails... made allowances for positioning to ensure the tips were placed on evenly... applied a sheer, nude...subtlety pinkish, colored nail enamel... then applied a clear top coat and ... boom! Instant chic-ness. I love it! They do not look cheap, has a professional salon quality look (some folks even thought they were acrylics), and they last. I&#x27;ve had my set on for about five days now and they still look fresh. And at 6 dollars a pop, you cannot go wrong!</li>
    <li> I bought Incoco and Sally Hansen French mani white strips. The Incoco strips are not strong, flexible or have any stretch to them. They tear easily and are difficult to use from getting them off of their strips to applying to the nails.  The Sally Hansen strips are stronger, flexible and have stretch to them so you can maneuver to where you want them on your nail.  They are easy to remove from the strip and go where you want them to without tearing. I won&#x27;t be buying Incoco again.</li>
    <li> I love these french nail tips, they were so easy to use and didn&#x27;t take much time to apply either. The first time I saw these they were in Las Vegas in the middle isle of the strip of the malls, and they actually do work, so I will purchase these again</li>
    <li> these did not work for me</li>
    <li> With these strips and the Shellac nail gel I have a professional looking manicure that lasts two weeks and costs me a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> They dont stay on like gel polish.  they stay goey like a sticker back and don&#x27;t &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; like a glue.</li>
    <li> I used the french tips from Incoco when they first came out. I&#x27;m not sure what they did to the product but I noticed the strips were very thin, almost see through, the packaging of the product is the dumbest design I&#x27;ve ever seen. The way they have the strips stuck together causes them to rip when you are trying to separate them. I remember using the french tips and they did not even chipping for about a week and a half and within a day these are already chipped. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for about 2 months and I absolutely love them!  I&#x27;ve tried all the products out there and these tips are the most ingenious I&#x27;ve ever encountered.  They are easy to apply and I found that the previous reviews were most helpful in the application process.  They last so much longer than I ever expected and they are absolutely fabulous.  I don&#x27;t ever want to run out of these ... am ordering more!  Try them, you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Oh, these are wonderful!  Stayed on really well - getting tired of painting,my nails only to have chips appear the next day.  Tape these on, couple coats of clear polish - looks just like french manicure!  Love them</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a regular customer of Incoco.  The very few times that the product arrived defective, Incoco is quick to refund or replace or both.  Sally Hansen sells a similar product in retail stores; however they don&#x27;t seem to carry just the white strips.  To get the white Sally Hansen tips, I have to buy the complete French set including the tips and another pink color which adds to the cost.  These tips are perfect, easy to apply, last 2 weeks with just a clear topcoat and easy to buy on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these nail things!  They make a french manicure take only a few minutes.  And the french manicure lasts for far longer than normal.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, good product. I use it with gel polish. If It is done correctly it can last 15 days, be sure you seal the tip with top coat!</li>
    <li> I purchased these because I love a french manicure, especially in the summer.  I have been using the pens, but find them to dry out fast and tend to be messy.  After reading reviews on these, I thought for the price, I&#x27;d give them a shot.  NEVER used any type of tips before.  I applied them to clean, no polish, freshly manicured nails.  I am right handed, so the left went on good.  Had to get the hubs to come in and help me straighten some on my right (he gladly obliged...).  After filing, I applied two coats of clear top coat.  We were headed to Florida on a bike trip so I was extremely careful, wanting them to last the full week.  As I write this, tomorrow will be THREE weeks they have been on and I have only applied a fresh top coat once!!! They are just now showing signs of wear, still no chipping, just dulled a bit.  YES, I have ordered two new sets already and can&#x27;t wait to reapply.  For the money, opposed to a $30-40 manicure, DEFINITELY worth it to me!!!!</li>
    <li> Application was followed to the letter and they peeled right off after the polish had fully dryed. was not real happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I really like these a lot.  I wish you sold the clear nail covers separately.</li>
    <li> I love these tips, they are easy to apply and look like a professional job.  They last about 2 weeks if you apply a quality top coat on them. I use a fast drying top coat called &amp;#34;Poshe&amp;#34; that I buy from Sally beauty supply</li>
    <li> So easy to do and look awesome!!!!!  I followed another reviewers suggestion and did the &amp;#34;as seen on TV&amp;#34; pink gel...looks great!!!</li>
    <li> I love these. Have used them for a long time.</li>
    <li> I used this and i got so many compliments the next day! People thought i had went to a salon and had my nails done. It was very simple to apply, just follow the directions. It lasted for a little over a week, which is great compared to salon manicures. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Loved these at first, they do stay on great and last a long time...However, I went back to buy a lot more (180.00 worth) and brought my mother-in-law and she bought a lot too for herself and her granddaughter, etc.  Anyway, half of the nail polish bags when we opened to use them were completely useless.  The did not stick on the finger(s) at all.  There was no stickiness on them and they did not work.  To top off a huge waste of time, effort and money, when we took them back to where we bought them, and showed them how they did not stick at all.  They told us &amp;#34;that is too bad&amp;#34;.  And did nothing for us toward their product that did not work.  Very disappointing and discouraging.  I strongly do not recommend wasting money on this product.  Some may stick to your nails, but many, many of them will NOT.</li>
    <li> I used these strips under the gel to create a French tip so the white is brighter.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!! These nail strips , I have to admit , I was skeptical, they are better than advertised.  Takes a little time and practice, I did the French manicure, but so worth the time. They lasted 4 weeks!!! I used to have pink and whit done in a salon, and I had to go every 3 weeks at 4xs the cost. Best of all, my nails looked just as pretty when I was done. Love them.</li>
    <li> I am not able to wear any other form of artificial nails due to an allergic reaction so I am loving these.  It takes a little practice to get them on but I am managing.  I have just put a clear polish over the top and they are lasting pretty well.  I also bought a couple of sets that include the polish and will try them later. Love having nice looking nails.</li>
    <li> These nail tips strips have changed my whole aggravating manicure dilemma. I have thin, weak nails and I love a French Manicure. It&#x27;s almost impossible to give myself a good French Manicure and so I go to the Nail Salon. Even the best one only lasts a couple of days before it chips and peels. The Incoco Polish Strips are easy to apply, just remember to stretch a little for a good fit. Then I apply a clear coat and that&#x27;s it! I apply a clear coat a couple of days later if I have time but the whole thing actually lasts up to two weeks! When I say I&#x27;ve tried everything for my nails, I mean everything. These nail strips help to protect my weak nails while they grow. I wish I would have discovered them YEARS ago. They are just amazing!</li>
    <li> These strips are awesome! They&#x27;re very simple to apply and they look very nice. Be mindful when you file off the extra, if you pull it off before it&#x27;s fully detached, you may introduce a tear, which will be easier to chip. Otherwise, I had no chipping problems and they lasted very well.</li>
    <li> Great fitting white tips for an at home french mani.  Much less expensive than buying this with the clear overlay.  I was able to do both hands and feet with one package!  I just used a clear top coat and used quick dry drops to prevent smearing.  They look like I went to a salon and will last 5-8 days.  If I do a clear coat every 2-3 days, I could get closer to 10-12 days!</li>
    <li> Last well and usually easy to use however they changed the packaging so you have to split one strip in half to use it (hard to explain) which makes it MUCH more difficult to get a nice line.  Go back to the old packaging!!!  When i used to get these in store there was an individual strip for each tip so stretching was minimized.</li>
    <li> Great Product. I last more than regular nail polish, however it does not last 14 days as described.&lt;br /&gt;Still a great product and I&#x27;ll continue to buy it as it looks elegant and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> It has been three weeks &amp; these get nail tips are still looking good! I gave this product a 4 out of 5 because they were not as simple to apply as I had hoped. I even ripped 2 of the tips trying to stretch them to make them fit. But, once you get the hang of it, they are fine. After applying the tips, I used a good, clear, top-coat.  I wash my dishes by hand, which ends up being about 4 times a day. Plus, I have a bad habit of using my nails to pry things open &amp; to scratch off price tags &amp; such. I can not believe how well they have lasted! No dents, marks or chips. After the first &amp;#34;perfect week&amp;#34;, I did get a small area  on the tip that wore off. I just put a dab of white nail polish on it and put another clear coat on all of the nails. I am looking at them now &amp; I am amazed at how great they still look. Will buy again for sure!</li>
    <li> with a newborn at home I do not have time to head to the nail salon for a manicure. this is the perfect product for a quick beautiful manicure. would highly recommend to anyone. I always get compliments on my nails.</li>
    <li> These make it easy to do professional-looking manicures at home. They are a little tricky to apply, but I got the hang of it quickly. I wish they had a rigid plastic tab of some sort to hold unto during application. They can be stretched and manipulated to match the natural curve of your fingernail. The sheets are so thin that there is no ridge visible. It looks seamless. There is enough to do long fingernails. My only complaint is the price. There is only enough to do one manicure. I apply these to my bare nail, then a coat of sheer pink OPI polish and finish with a UV-cured clear gel top coat. The white tips still look very nice after a week, very minimal chipping on the end of the nail. It could possibly be touched up with white polish, but the bottom of the nail near the cuticle is starting to lift.</li>
    <li> Used these nails strips ( tips only) for years. Love the product and will continue to buy as long as available.</li>
    <li> First, I would like to qualify my review with 2 statements.  1. The small chipping of the nail strip (and not my nail) was found after I had filed my nails.  2. The sheer pink top coat I used was an As Seen On TV product of nail gel (not the kind that needs a UV light, but comes off easily with polish remover) that seemed to wear longer than other polishes. Today it is 3 weeks since I first put these on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These nail strips were a bit tricky to put on. First you need to determine the size you need for the width of each nail. Each strip is covered with a protective clear strip that you remove first.  Then you peel the polish strip off by the silver end. Gently place the polish strip as far up or down as you want the white polish on your nail, and try to center it if you can before you smooth the sides down.  If you misplace it, sloooowly and carefully pull it off and try again. Do not press the strip down on your nail until you are sure it is where you want it to be.  Then fold the excess down over the end of your nail and file off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, put 2 coats of a sheer color polish of your choice (As mentioned above,I used the As Seen On TV one). A few times after I filed/shaped my nails, I noticed that a small bit of the polish strip at the end of my nail had chipped off (not my actual nail, but the polish strip). This I fixed by touching up with a French Manicure White Tip Pen or with some white nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other issue I had to deal with was my nails growing out and leaving a gap between my cuticles and the top coat. I lightly filed/buffed the top coat above my cuticles to remove rough edges, and I put on another layer of the top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been 3 weeks today since I first put on the polish strips, and (except for the bits of chipping, which I believe was caused by filing,) they still look good. I think they are going to outlast my top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am impressed with how good the nail strips look and how long they are lasting. Friends think I have just gotten a manicure. I recommend this product for those who will take their time applying it.</li>
    <li> These were not at all what I expected, they do not stick at all, I could be doing wrong, but I did follow the directions.  There is no way I would buy this product again.  I wouldn&#x27;t even accept it as a gift.</li>
    <li> Very good!! I like this product &amp; will likely buy it again...stays for about 3 weeks depending what kind of work you do.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It took a few times to figure out the placement.  My third time lasted 2 weeks.  I topcoat every couple of days and file the tips if there is a tiny chip.  It protects my nails very well.  I use Orly Bonder Ruberized Basecoat and Soleil heat dry topcoat and my last manicure lasted 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> I was stopped in a kiosk in Vegas and were shown these French nail strips. I was skeptical because I was shown numerous nail products that I was told &#x27;its easy&#x27; , and &#x27;anyone can do it&#x27; but when I get it home and try it it is impossible to do my own nails!  So instead of letting the salesgirl do my nail, I asked if she would &#x27;instruct&#x27; me to do my own nail. Well I did and it was easier than the other one, but it still takes patience and time.</li>
    <li> the biggest waste of my money. what  a joke!</li>
    <li> This does make French Manicures a bit less messy for me, but there is still the matter of placing it just right and then there is something of a ridge that shows a bit beneath the sheer polish. It&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> I reorder and reorder if done right they last for 1-2 weeks.</li>
    <li> love this product working on my second set</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for these for about 6 this now! Our local Walgreens sold them for about a year then all of a sudden stopped carrying them. So I got stuck using the cheap knock off Sally Hansen makes..EPIC FAIL! I hate going to nail salons &amp; was so happy I found these again!</li>
    <li> Pretty but didn&#x27;t last</li>
    <li> easier than free hand</li>
    <li> I like french mnicure, but I do not want to spend time on it. Incoco Tips are the best solution for me. It took only about 7-10 minutes to apply it on my nails. And it was really good for about 10 days. My problem was that I didn&#x60;t apply a strong nail polish on the top, used a usuall nail polish. I am sure next time it will last 2 weeks and more. Five stars, thank you, Incoco, you are the best, guys.</li>
    <li> these are great!  Once you learn the tricks to handling and placing them on your nail tips, they look great!</li>
    <li> Have been using these for over 6 months.  Each manicure lasts about 3 weeks with just a coat of clear polish over the top.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply. I love doing my own nails and these give you the perfect line that I always love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched the tutorial at first and realized there are two stickers of white on one strip. It takes practice but eventually, you&#x27;ll become a pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t get enough of these and ordered quite a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definetly apply a top coat over them.  I like Sally Hansens hard as nails sheer pink tint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend these!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never ordered anything like this before, so it was a surprise to me I need to use it immediately after open the package. It takes some practice to get use to it. But I am quite happy with my result after first attempted trying. The finish still little rough but it looks pretty good overall. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have purchased these strips several times.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used them with regular polish as the last layer for my French manicure. Initially, they were beautiful! But within HOURS there were chips in the stickers, which was really disappointing. Within a couple of days the tips (stickers) started to have a &amp;#34;cracked&amp;#34; look that was very unattractive. I removed them after a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to do my gel nails at home, and love a gel French manicure, but getting the tips right can be very time consuming. I thought I&#x27;d try these tips with the gel and see how they worked. I did the ph bond, foundation, one coat of a sheer pink and one coat of a sparkle (water field) then I applied the top coat as usual. (I was worried about trying to apply the sticker to the tacky layer of gel, but may try that in the future.) I applied the stickers, but again noticed some imperfect places (maybe it&#x27;s my application technique) which I touched up with white polish. I did another top coat and they were gorgeous. They lasted a couple of weeks with no crackle or chipping.&lt;br /&gt;I have read that others apply to the bare nail before any gel at all, and that will be my next experiment, but I will definitely buy them again. Just wish they came with more than one set per pack.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these tips  a long time.  They are so easy to put on and last about two weeks.  Everyone thinks I&#x27;ve had them done professionally . Amazon had them shipped in a very short time.. Thank you Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joyce</li>
    <li> These are the best things ever.  They make is so easy to get a perfect French manicure at home.  They are easy to use and they last well over a week without chipping.  Walgreen&#x27;s was crazy to stop carrying them!</li>
    <li> These were difficult to handle. I guess it would be best to get some instruction from staff at a beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> For me this product last up to at least 10 days. Where as a regular manicure for the most part will only last 2 days. Of course you have to be willing to give yourself a manicure but its so worth it.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t even stick ON.</li>
    <li> Love these! I was pleasantly surprised how easy to put these on and how professional these look! Don&#x27;t know how long they last just yet, but if I have issues, I will update my review. So much cheaper than the salon, yet salon results :)</li>
    <li> Easy to use and don&#x27;t have to wait for long dry time.</li>
    <li> When I first went to put on these nail stickers I noticed how thin and flimsy they actually were, which made for a somewhat difficult application.  I wasted about 3 of the nail stickers before I actually got a good application.  However, once the nails were on I was thoroughly pleased at how nice they actually looked when applied correctly, but that was short lived.  Literally less than 2 hours later, with minimal wear on them, I noticed that they were already chipping in multiple places! I followed all of the instructions to the T and even used a good top coat!  Now a whole day later, every single one of my nails is chipped! I&#x27;d love to know how people got their nails to last 2+ weeks, because I know mine won&#x27;t even last a week without having to be removed.  Overall, I am disappointed in this product and I will not buy them again.</li>
    <li> Love these tips. Looks so professional &amp;amp; lasts for 2 weeks. I use these all the time. Very easy to put on, then I clear coat them 3x. Looks beautiful, saves money.&lt;br /&gt;It took a bit to learn how to apply them. I found that placing the tip on the nail, then press it on, then pull the excess is easier than using the nail file. Be careful pulling though, you don&#x27;t want to tear it off! It takes a bit to do, but it&#x27;s totally worth it. Everyone praises my nails &amp;amp; asks where I get them done, I say my own salon!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these!  I can make them go 3 weeks easily.  I place them a little lower than my natural tips and use a 60 second clear top coat.  After one week, I carefully remove just the clear coat, push back my cuticles,apply a fresh clear coat and I&#x27;m ready for week 2!  At the end of week two, I file my nails down a little, remove the top coat and reapply and now I&#x27;m ready for week three!  I am probably an exception to the two week time because I have very hard nails naturally, which means my nails don&#x27;t bend and flex which could cause the polish to crack.  Hint: when applying, start with pinkies, alternating hands until you finish all fingers and doing thumbs last.</li>
    <li> I use a computer all day and type furiously, so normal nail polish chips within 2 days for me! But I can keep this going for up to 3 weeks still looking great and getting compliments all around. Since i&#x27;m not a nail professional, I try to do my best at home. I have a shellac kit, but putting on French manicure has always eluded me. I&#x27;ve tried all the \\&quot;guides\\&quot; where you put on a sticker, paint over it, then remove the sticker.. and the problem with those is that they always seem to get messy on one side or another, or streak when you pull off the sticker. But not this item! This one is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I do:&lt;br /&gt;1- Put on shellac gel base layer and let it dry in my UV lamp for 3-5 minutes&lt;br /&gt;2- clean it with 100% acetone&lt;br /&gt;3- Put these on&lt;br /&gt;4- (optional) add some white shellac to them (much easier to follow the line, and can clean it up easier too since you clean till you touch the \\&quot;sticker\\&quot;) and let that dry under UV for 3-5 minutes&lt;br /&gt;5- (optional) I have this regular nailpolish ever-so-slightly pink color that is made as top coat for French manicures. I put it on top of these to give it a very sexy and professionally-done look. It doesn&#x27;t matter that it&#x27;s the normal nailpolish not shellac, because of step 6.&lt;br /&gt;6- Top it off with shellac top layer and let that dry&lt;br /&gt;7- clean it, and voila! Beautiful salon quality nails that last for 3 weeks with such little effort and money.</li>
    <li> I love the strips but wish there were more in the pack for wider nails - I&#x27;m lucky my sister uses these, too, so we can mix and math sizes - she has very small hands.</li>
    <li> **UPDATED REVIEW**  After applying these tips I&#x27;m pretty pleased with the outcome.  This definitely beats trying to apply white nail polish or manicure pens to the tips of your nails with (or without) nail tip guards.  I&#x27;m use my hands extensively, so I didn&#x27;t expect these to last the two weeks maximum, but they did last longer than painting the tips.  I followed the directions, buffed my nails, cleaned them, and applied the tips according to the directions, and applied the Sally Hansen Hard as Nails topcoat.  After 5 days, I have VERY small cracks running in the tips, and one of the tips has started to chip.  I&#x27;m guessing if I didn&#x27;t use my hands for everything, like a guy (lol) they would last longer.  Either way, these are easy to apply and look awesome!  I&#x27;ll have to try clipping off the ends as mentioned in the second review to see if they look new again and don&#x27;t chip when I clip them.   Some tips: I have to agree with the second review-I used a metal nail file and creased down, not side to side, to remove the excess tip. I used a topcoat-a must.   (INITIAL REVIEW)  I haven&#x27;t applied these tips yet, but just wanted to mention that there is only one set of 16 strips (8 sizes) per package. Many of them look like they will be too big for my nails. I was expecting more strips and more sizes due to looking at Incoco&#x27;s other products and viewing their website.) They should definitely state this in their product description. For this reason, for now, I&#x27;m rating these 4 stars. I&#x27;ll update after I&#x27;ve actually applied the nail tips.</li>
    <li> I have been using these french tips for almost 2 weeks and they still look amazing.They are also easy to do. I love this product!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE these manicure tips - I order them 10 at a time so that I have a stash for a while!  I&#x27;ve tried every option for doing your own french manicure and this is hands down the best.  Inevitably I end up chipping a brand new salon manicure within 24 hours.  I am hard on my nails but I love having them look professional without having to use acrylics and other harsh chemicals.  It takes a little getting used to, but you can&#x27;t beat a french manicure that lasts for up to 2 weeks and still looks nearly perfect for a bargain price!  Plus I love being able to say I do my own manicure :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some helpful hints I have learned over the last 2 years:&lt;br /&gt;1. I always buff my nails before applying them to get rid of any ridges and help them adhere better.&lt;br /&gt;2. I always try to use a tip that is wider than my actual nail so that I can file the excess on the side and allow more wiggle room to get the tip on without leaving a blank space on the edge.&lt;br /&gt;3. I use a metal nail file to remove the excess after I make sure they are secure.  Usually I apply all of one hand and wait a couple minutes before filing. I found that filing side to side with the file can tear the strip and makes the edges ragged, so I file perpindicular to the edge of my nail from front to back.&lt;br /&gt;4. Apply a clear topcoat to give them the shine of a salon manicure.  I still haven&#x27;t found the perfect top coat, but I keep looking.&lt;br /&gt;5. After about a week or when the edges start to look a little ragged, I trim my nails and file.  Voila!  A brand new manicure that lasts another week.  In order to do this, I do have to apply the tips a little lower on my nail initially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they still sold these in stores because they were priced even better and it was more convenient, but these are definitely worth ordering.  I don&#x27;t even mind paying for shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** I finally found a great basecoat / topcoat - Salon Sciences Bonding Basecoat.  It gives a nice shine toyour nails and stays on for the entire two weeks that the manicure lasts.  I put one coat on before the tips, let them adhere for a little while and go over with one coat.  Any other basecoat or topcoat that I had used previously would chip or peel at least once during the two week wear.</li>
    <li> I love these strips!  They keep my polish on longer and make my nails stronger!  Highly recommend  I&#x27;ve gotten several friends hooked on them too.  Just wish they still sold them at Walgreens</li>
    <li> If they would&#x27;ve stayed as long as they said I would&#x27;ve been sold. They took quite a while to put on but I figured if they stayed long it was worth it. The look is truly perfect. Unfortunately they started chipping within a day or 2. I filed them down to make then last longer as others mentioned, but I&#x27;m very particular about my nails so even the little cracks they get bother me. They&#x27;re great for a special event but definitely not ideal for everyday with continual application due to cost and time for short term results.</li>
    <li> It takes some practice, but this is definitely a less messy option for getting a french manicure.  I recommend getting a set and trying it.  After I apply the tip, I buff it gently to get the ridge as close to my natural nail as possible, wipe off any powder then apply clear gel coating.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these nail strips for a long time and have really liked them. This was my first time ordering online and I am NOT happy with what I received. I got EIGHT strips in my package..... Eight. They weren&#x27;t stuck together.... I checked and rechecked. What a waste of money, I won&#x27;t be ordering these again. Do yourself a favor and save your money.... Unless you&#x27;re missing fingers.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these stick-on french tips!!  For years I&#x27;ve tried to get the line straight with the traditional french nail polish and it always came out horrible.  With these, you just prepare your nails as usual and just peel and stick...buff off the excess and apply your top coat and nobody can tell its a stick-on!  I ordered 3 more packs...one for each of my daughters and of course another one for me.  You can get a great look that isn&#x27;t tacky in a fraction of the time and money you would spend at a salon.  Kudos to this seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller shipped on time..packaging was great...price is great.  Would recommend this seller :-)</li>
    <li> I prefer these over getting a french mani at a salon!  I can do them anytime I like, and they last for weeks without chipping.  The low price is just an added bonus!  I&#x27;ve recommended these to several friends (and will continue to do so!).</li>
    <li> White I generally like this product very much, the last order was obviously old stock.  The product needs to be new stock otherwise the gels thicken and do not adhere to nails.</li>
    <li> I GUESS IT IS AN OKAY PRODUCT, BUT TOO MUCH PUTZING AROUND TO GET THEM ON AND THEY REALLY DIDN&#x27;T LAST THE 14 DAYS...LOOKED GOOD FOR A FEW DAYS, BUT STARTED TO CHIP AFTER ABOUT THE THIRD DAY.  WOULD NOT SPEND THE 10.00 TO BUY THEM AGAIN.</li>
    <li> SUCCESS.....FINALLY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish someone had told me how to do this.  It would have saved me A LOT of time and money.  This is how to do a French manicure using the gelish system.....that will last at least 2 weeks, if not longer.  If you do this exactly how I have instructed, the French tips will be almost as strong as acrylics from the salon.  Trust me, it works and at a fraction of the cost.  I do this AT NIGHT so I can sleep all night without my nails being vulnerable to anything that could damage them.  When I wake in the morning, my nails are super strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need:&lt;br /&gt;*Gelish products: cleanse solution, PH Bond, Structure gel, princess pink polish, foundation gel, top coat gel&lt;br /&gt;*\\&quot;Out the door\\&quot; top coat.  I get this at Sally&#x27;s. It&#x27;s a fast drying top coat and I haven&#x27;t found anything even close to how it protects your nails!&lt;br /&gt;*UV Lamp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.Buff and clean nails using cleanse solution&lt;br /&gt;2.Apply PH Bond&lt;br /&gt;3.Apply French tips to clean nails. I cut the ends off close to where I will ultimately shape my nails.......not until entire process is finished.&lt;br /&gt;4.Apply one coat of foundation gel over entire nail, including french tips.... cure 2 minutes&lt;br /&gt;5.Apply 1 layer of gelish structure over entire nail, including french tips ......cure 2 minutes&lt;br /&gt;6.Apply princess pink polish (I only use 1 coat) over entire nail, including french tips ........cure 2 minutes&lt;br /&gt;7.Apply top coat over entire nail, including french tips ......cure 2 minutes&lt;br /&gt;8.Apply \\&quot;out the door\\&quot; top coat.........I do this last step right before I am getting into bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t shape my nails until the next morning because by then my nails are super hard and can be shaped much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps get you the French manicure you&#x27;ve been looking for </li>
    <li> Easiest French Manicure! They are already dry so you cannot accidentally mess up your manicure. The price is amazing, so even if you mess up it is still worth it. It may take you a couple times to get the hang of it when using your left hand (or weak hand). They protect your nails from breaking. You will seriously not get a broken nail when you wear these stickers. Its like having a clear bra on your nice car... no chips or scratches.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It makes creating a French manicure so incredibly easy.  The appliques are strong yet pliable enough to apply easily.  The manicure really does last up to two weeks.</li>
    <li> There are pros and cons to these nail polish strips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Extremely convenient and time-saving--much easier than drawing on your own french manicure.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use--you can even reposition them if you put them down incorrectly.  You get about two trys before the shape becomes distorted.&lt;br /&gt;They look perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t work well with gel nails--they cause peeling and chip easily.  I kept getting tears and flakes at the tip and free edge.&lt;br /&gt;They looked too perfect--great from far away, but up close, they looked really fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They may work much better with traditional nail polish--but not so good with gel products.  Won&#x27;t buy them again, even though they were so easy to put on.</li>
    <li> Icouldn&#x27;t wait to receive these.  I followed all the dirctions and could not get these to stick to my nails.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> These tips were fabulous. I&#x27;m a manicurist and always want to have nice looking nails. These by far were better than my own free hand French tip and lasted almost 2 full weeks! So worth if you want to do it yourself. Invest in a good base and top coat and you won&#x27;t regret this purchase!</li>
    <li> I thought this was more than only the white line...I thought it was the line and the color</li>
    <li> I use them all the time...I like the tips only...they really do stay on for 2 weeks...</li>
    <li> Difficult to use and didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> I loved these nail strip/tips!  After reading a few not so great reviews I was a big worried but they have lasted a full two weeks. I touched them up a couple times with a new coat of clear. Into the second week, the clear polish  started to yellow so I used some polish remover to take it off and reapplied a coat of clear.  The tips stayed on even with the polish remover - fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone things I either have fake nails or had gel nails professionally done!</li>
    <li> lOVE THEM.EASY TO APPLY,LAST A VERY LONG TIME.WISH THEY CAME IN ALL KINDS OFCOLORS.WISH THEY WERE SOLD AT WALGREENS,MUCH CHEAPER</li>
    <li> I thought it would be a good idea to buy these because I love having white tips. but it was horrible. they are hard to use.</li>
    <li> I tried this item 3 different times and it peeled off my nails within hours. I was really hoping it would work much better but alas, I am still on the quest for maintainable/easy French manicures. (I stink with drawing the smile line with a brush and the guides just let polish underneath them.)</li>
    <li> It was ridiculously over priced,I tried to contact them, but got no response at all. Very bad experience. I will never buy Incoco product again.</li>
    <li> These are best ever/ So simple to put on. They look and feel like polish. They have a little stretch in them which means no wrinkles. I have had these on for 10 days and they only show signs of nail growth no chipping or marks. I highly recommend them to anyone who wants that salon look.</li>
    <li> Too easy to make thick. I thick this is a very good product except you have to be very careful. To not make the tips too thick! No ones fault but my own I suppose. Oh well may order and try again.</li>
    <li> I initially had 5 stars for this and decided to demote. I usually buy these 5-7 at a time because its cheaper than a manicure and easy to use. I really like them alot and they last pretty long. However the last shipment I received made me pretty angry. One of the envelopes had already been used by someone who obviously returned it thinking it wouldn&#x27;t be checked (they were right) The seal was broken, the envelope was cut open, a few strips were missing and the remainder dried out and the envelope taped back together. It really grossed me out and made me angry I paid 6 bucks for this ( I know that may not seem like alot but that&#x27;s money i work hard for) Luckily, the rest in the shipment were untouched. I feel like this company tried to pull a fast one on me and ripped me off. I have tried the Sally Hansen strips and they work just as well (albeit a little more expensive) so I may go that route.</li>
    <li> They last a while and look like you had them done without the expense.  Very happy and excited to know I can do a French manicure in the comfort of my own home. Takes a moment to adjust them the way you like but worth the outcome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Incoco nail tips for a long time but they stopped selling them at the Walgreens so I&#x27;ve taken to ordering them now.  They are phenomenal!!  It is much more cost effective to do your own nails and with these tips you get an absolutely perfect french manicure every time.  I simply can&#x27;t give this product enough stars!!!!</li>
    <li> If I could give these no stars I would. They are brittle and break and crack before you even can mold them to your nails, awful!!</li>
    <li> My sister turned me onto these when I commented on her french manicure 3 years ago and I&#x27;ve been a loyal customer ever since.  SO easy, dry immediately, look professional, and so much more cost effective than acrylics and the need for fills or even having french manicure painted or airbrushed at the salon. The convenience too of being able to do them at your home, while watching tv, in all of 5 minutes, is fabulous. This was a great invention and I absolutely will use these forever.</li>
    <li> Awful! After spending all that time putting them on, I applied a top coat to protect them and they melted!</li>
    <li> I use this product very often. I saves me the trip to the salon and the expensive French manicure. If you have left over tips put them inside the plastic case close it (i use a couple of paper clips) and put the case inside a plastic bag. If you leave them inside the plastic case alone for a long time they loose the special glue.</li>
    <li> I love the colors, For me they didn&#x27;t stay on the full 14 days but about a week which is pretty good too, I wear it under my gel polishes...</li>
    <li> tips are so easy to apply even on short nails.  Had these on for about a week now and still in place....VERY surprised!  I do alot of house work, gardening not to mention 40 hour work week and these things don&#x27;t chip or &#x27;peel&#x27; off.  Applied only a clear coat over white tips only.  I&#x27;m ordering $50 worth now! WORTH EVERY PENNY!! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I ve been using the incoco nail strips for a month and I changed them every two weeks for a new color. I have always been recognized for having long and hard nails but since I&#x27;ve been using it,  my nails turned out to be very brittle and fragile and brake easily. This not only happens with my nails but also my mom&#x27;s. It has to be this nail strips. Does anyone suffer from this before?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these before but am unable to find them locally anymore. Very easy to apply resulting in a very professional look. Have received many complements on my Incoco manicure plus the money you&#x27;ll save is an added bonus.</li>
    <li> They are kind of hard to apply, confusing, they give you 8 per pack when you have 10 fingers, kind of weird, but ok</li>
    <li> Not worth the application time.  Chipped in two days.</li>
    <li> Looks great and last for a long time.</li>
    <li> I have tried Sally Hansen and Kiss brand French polish strips and these Incoco are far superior.  Easier to work with  better adhesion and resistant to damage from normal wear and tear.  I sealed the strips with Kiss gel top coat and UV lamp.  Will definitely order again</li>
