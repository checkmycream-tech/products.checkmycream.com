      <li>Hear about this on the Dr. Oz show and I am very impressed.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product though!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
      <li>Great face cream I am using with Vitamin C lotion to reduce redness in my face</li>
      <li>It is a great moisturizer.</li>
      <li>and I am very happy with the consistently and how it feels on my face.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice cream</li>
      <li>love it, the product leaves me with radiant skin a good product.  </li>
      <li>It goes and absorbs nicely into skin</li>
      <li>I sleep better, I&#x27;ve lost some belly fat and my mood is improving.</li>
      <li>I love this skin cream.  </li>
      <li>Nice light cream for summer nights - use sparingly in the morning</li>
      <li>and I already feel better.</li>
      <li>I have been spoiled with the NIA 24, and extended my budget to purchase more of it, instead of using this product.  </li>
      <li>I think it worked, but it may have just been the cooling peppermint sensation that made me feel better.</li>
      <li>Need more time to see changes.</li>
      <li>Either way, it made me a bit more comfortable when I had the flu.</li>
      <li>Fortunately I did not have to go anywhere that day.</li>
      <li>and you will be comfortable and moisturized all day.</li>
      <li>/&gt; however  from swanson when  its  available....</li>
      <li>First off this cream did not cause any skin break out or redness which was a bit surprising since my skin is rather sensitive.  </li>
      <li>but I have seen more reduction in fine lines, especially around my mouth &amp; eyes.  </li>
      <li>She likes it very much.  </li>
      <li>just an overall improvement in color an fine lines.</li>
      <li>I really like this product and it seems to have help with the aging around my eyes</li>
      <li>Thanks Dr. Oz.</li>
      <li>Rosacea is very &amp;#34;particular&amp;#34; and one thing works for some and not others.</li>
      <li>This cream probably works very well for others, just not me.</li>
      <li>Keep in mind that your skin will most likely get very red the first couple times you use it on a part of your skin.</li>
      <li>I first bought this at a health food store near where I live( for quite a higher price) and felt like it really worked for me.</li>
      <li>If you want a lotion that doesn&#x27;t feel gross and thick or like you&#x27;re wearing anything, this is a great one for you.</li>
      <li>Hard to describe what kind of difference but</li>
      <li>This may be a perfectly wonderful cream, however the smell is so bad I could not stand to wear it.</li>
      <li>If you have a sensitive nose this is not for you!</li>
      <li>The next morning, my face was extremely red and very hot.  </li>
      <li>Everyone wants to know what I am using on my skin because I look sooo much younger!!!</li>
      <li>I put it on at night and nearly slid out of bed.</li>
      <li>As far as how well it works, it will take a longer period to know this.  </li>
      <li>I have only used this cream for 5 days now and really like it for my hands too.  </li>
      <li>I have mild Rosacea on my cheeks and on my nostrils and this product seems to lessen the severity of the blushing effect on the cheeks and on my nose the capillaries have even shrunk down in size.</li>
      <li>I normally buy quality, expensive creams, so I could tell the first time I used this, that it contains cheap ingredients.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it only takes a little to cover my face lightly.  </li>
      <li>and if you apply enough it can last a whole day.</li>
      <li>Caused major breakouts</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s only $5 directly from the Swanson website.</li>
      <li>You may have to pay a little shipping but it still ends up being cheaper and you can buy more for so much less in one order.</li>
      <li>The day after that, my face was starting to calm down.</li>

<li> The day after that, my face was starting to calm down.</li>
<li> It has a good amount of peppermint which is soothing to the nose and throat, especially when you are sick.</li>
<li> I think over the past 100 years we humans have become an indoor species that which we are not designed for- our levels of vitamin D were probably much higher long ago.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m glad to know this product contains vitamins instead of potentially dangerous chemicals.</li>
<li> It mixes well with other products like essential oils.</li>
<li> Had to use it with other products because it left my skin dry.</li>
<li> She uses it to help remove blemishes on her shin from an unknown bug bite.</li>
<li> I almost never get chapped lips anymore even during the winter (like a handful of times since I started using it a few years ago, though results may be different for you).</li>
<li> nothing for me other than cost me $$.  </li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin other than dryness.</li>
<li> dark spots  </li>
<li> /&gt;However, if used daily, after sometime, there may be some results, but I only used it a few times, because I was not happy with the feel of it on my skin.</li>
<li> You are supposed to take it at the first sign of a cold or the flu coming on.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if it worked a little</li>
<li> It is less expensive than NIA 24 and produces the same results.  </li>
<li> Could be the Rosacea coming and going, or this product, not sure, but it seems to be working.</li>
<li> The day after that, my skin peeled a small amount.</li>
<li> Not sure what that was all about.</li>
<li> While chap still can be annoying, needs to be re-applied constantly, and feels gross, this product after it dries</li>
<li> but it did not work for me, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for someone else.</li>
<li> but the flush face is not a good sign.</li>
<li> Poor product.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I have an allergic reaction to the product.</li>
<li> However, since the Hydroquinone could be dangerous, I wanted to let her try out an alternative.</li>
<li> I am a 62 woman that has used very expensive products from my Dermatologist</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Product as described.</li>
    <li> no difference in skin</li>
    <li> I have mild Rosacea on my cheeks and on my nostrils and this product seems to lessen the severity of the blushing effect on the cheeks and on my nose the capillaries have even shrunk down in size. Could be the Rosacea coming and going, or this product, not sure, but it seems to be working. Moisturizes and helps with the wrinkles around my eyes too. I&#x27;ll be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I have an allergic reaction to the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot about vitamin D and I thought I would give this product a try. I have been on this for three weeks now and I already feel better. I sleep better, I&#x27;ve lost some belly fat and my mood is improving. I think over the past 100 years we humans have become an indoor species that which we are not designed for- our levels of vitamin D were probably much higher long ago.</li>
    <li> I tried this cream for rosacea because they are saying now that niacin amide may stop rocacea. I put it on my face for 2 days but each day my face was flush red so I gave up. I&#x27;m not sure if it worked a little but the flush face is not a good sign.</li>
    <li> Excellent!!!  My skin looks absolutely flawless!!! Everyone wants to know what I am using on my skin because I look sooo much younger!!!</li>
    <li> She says it doesn&#x27;t quite work as well as the products that contain Hydroquinone. However, since the Hydroquinone could be dangerous, I wanted to let her try out an alternative. I&#x27;m glad to know this product contains vitamins instead of potentially dangerous chemicals.</li>
    <li> I love this skin cream.  It is less expensive than NIA 24 and produces the same results.  I recommend this for anyone looking to even their skin tone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product! Don&#x27;t buy it on Amazon though. It&#x27;s only $5 directly from the Swanson website. You may have to pay a little shipping but it still ends up being cheaper and you can buy more for so much less in one order. It&#x27;s a great product though! I swear by this for chapped lips! While chap still can be annoying, needs to be re-applied constantly, and feels gross, this product after it dries feels like nothing is on your lips and if you apply enough it can last a whole day. I almost never get chapped lips anymore even during the winter (like a handful of times since I started using it a few years ago, though results may be different for you). If you want a lotion that doesn&#x27;t feel gross and thick or like you&#x27;re wearing anything, this is a great one for you. Keep in mind that your skin will most likely get very red the first couple times you use it on a part of your skin. This ends after like two days.</li>
    <li> I have Rosacea and gave this cream a try but it did not work for me, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for someone else. The item came on time and was as described, so for that I give it 3 stars. Rosacea is very &amp;#34;particular&amp;#34; and one thing works for some and not others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for over 45 days and I like the consistency and it only takes a little to cover my face lightly.  As far as how well it works, it will take a longer period to know this.  I&#x27;m using it for aging effects.</li>
    <li> Just three words Awesome Awesome Awesome. This stuff is magically Awesome!</li>
    <li> I had no idea that niacin was so stinky or that the formulation of this cream would be so greasy. I put it on at night and nearly slid out of bed.</li>
    <li> Hear about this on the Dr. Oz show and I am very impressed.  I am a 62 woman that has used very expensive products from my Dermatologist but I have seen more reduction in fine lines, especially around my mouth &amp; eyes.  It does cause some peeling which I have taken care of with monthly micro-dermabrasion treatments.</li>
    <li> love it, the product leaves me with radiant skin a good product.  will continue to buy this product thank you</li>
    <li> I really like this product and it seems to have help with the aging around my eyes</li>
    <li> Will not order this product again.  Ended up using it on my hands.  Had to use it with other products because it left my skin dry. I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin other than dryness.</li>
    <li> Remember, niacin does bring the blood toward the surface of the skin.  I used the dime size amount on my face as directed.  The next morning, my face was extremely red and very hot.  Fortunately I did not have to go anywhere that day. The day after that, my face was starting to calm down. The day after that, my skin peeled a small amount. Not sure what that was all about. Perhaps my skin type doesn&#x27;t need this cream and/or my Dr. was pulling my leg about rosacea. This cream probably works very well for others, just not me.</li>
    <li> This may be a perfectly wonderful cream, however the smell is so bad I could not stand to wear it. If you have a sensitive nose this is not for you!</li>
    <li> Not enough niacin or moisture in it. Poor product. It dries before penetrates, will not use it again. Will not refer.</li>
    <li> Another purchase for one of my daughters.  She likes it very much.  She uses it to help remove blemishes on her shin from an unknown bug bite.</li>
    <li> This will help with a skin issue--thanks!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 1 month now, still no noticeable difference.  Guess some of these comment&#x27;s are put there to sell this product but has&lt;br /&gt;done nothing for me other than cost me $$.  No topical benefit for this person!!  Would NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS PRODUCT for what ever they are recommending it for.</li>
    <li> PERFECT  for  my skin. However  i  mixed  mine  with a soft&lt;br /&gt;cocoa butter cream....Niacin  cream  has  evened out  the  blotches&lt;br /&gt;and dark spots  i had.  I just  kept  on  using  it  and&lt;br /&gt;i  have  been using it now for over 6  months....Its  not&lt;br /&gt;going to work  in  24  hours.......I almost  threw it away at first&lt;br /&gt;but, decided to  mix it and use it  and it worked...I buy mine&lt;br /&gt; however  from swanson when  its  available....</li>
    <li> Excellent product delivered on time</li>
    <li> It is a great moisturizer. I use it before applying sunblock. My wife uses it before bed and in the morning. It mixes well with other products like essential oils.</li>
    <li> I normally buy quality, expensive creams, so I could tell the first time I used this, that it contains cheap ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;However, if used daily, after sometime, there may be some results, but I only used it a few times, because I was not happy with the feel of it on my skin. I have been spoiled with the NIA 24, and extended my budget to purchase more of it, instead of using this product.  The NIA 24 feels luxurious the moment you put it on.  Never used anything else like it.</li>
    <li> Great face cream I am using with Vitamin C lotion to reduce redness in my face and they are actually working.  Thanks Dr. Oz.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and I am very happy with the consistently and how it feels on my face.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice cream but I haven&#x27;t notice any change in appearance of wrinkles. It goes and absorbs nicely into skin</li>
    <li> First off this cream did not cause any skin break out or redness which was a bit surprising since my skin is rather sensitive.  After about 4 weeks of use, I won&#x27;t say that I look any younger but do feel that it has made a difference.  Hard to describe what kind of difference but just an overall improvement in color an fine lines.</li>
    <li> Nice light cream for summer nights - use sparingly in the morning and you will be comfortable and moisturized all day.</li>
    <li> Caused major breakouts</li>
    <li> Need more time to see changes.</li>
    <li> I first bought this at a health food store near where I live( for quite a higher price) and felt like it really worked for me. It has a good amount of peppermint which is soothing to the nose and throat, especially when you are sick. You are supposed to take it at the first sign of a cold or the flu coming on.  I think it worked, but it may have just been the cooling peppermint sensation that made me feel better. Either way, it made me a bit more comfortable when I had the flu.</li>
    <li> I have only used this cream for 5 days now and really like it for my hands too.  I buy mine form Piping Rock and it is $5.49 for a 4 oz jar.</li>
