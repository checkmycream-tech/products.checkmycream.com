      <li>It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;build up&amp;#34; so my hair feels clean even after a couple of days spray on it.  </li>
      <li>hair stays good all day and looks the same as when the day started.</li>
      <li>Great hair product for giving body to fine limp hair</li>
      <li>est super dfdsfs efwe efef eEF ERGQ FEQ</li>
      <li>The cost was pretty high, but bought it because of the good reviews and like this manufacturers Amplify hairspray so much.  </li>
      <li>I use this product when I&#x27;m able to air dry after a few minutes using the diffuser and it works great!  </li>
      <li>drys quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue like some other products do - and best of all it lasts all day!</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally curly and naturally unruly (does whatever it wants and ignores what I want) and this product does a really good job of helping hold my hair where I ask it to be.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for a few years now, and it works great on short, or medium length hair.</li>
      <li>Arrived in a timely manner and was very well packaged.  </li>

      <li>/&gt;However, once that&#x27;s done I have glossy, incredibly defined curls that start higher above my ears than  my usual loose ringlets do.</li>
      <li>It stays natural looking but really defines the curls and holds them in place.</li>
      <li>It really makes our hair look thicker while keeping it soft.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff and use it everyday.</li>
      <li>Adds just the right amount of texture and styling to my hair from punking up short hair, to adding volume and texture to my mid-length hair.</li>
      <li>Needed to find a new product since KMS changed their fragrance.</li>
      <li>Love this product, hard to find elsewhere</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair.  </li>
      <li>If air dried, rarely get curls above the ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Several actresses, that have fine thin hair like mine, said it works for them.</li>

<li> This is a great product, I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now, however, this price is crazy!  </li>
<li> I was surprised by the small size when I opened the box, though I knew it was five ounces.  </li>
<li> I use it on wet and dry hair.  </li>

<li> It doesn&#x27;t get crunchy and wet looking.</li>
<li> I have long, thick, coarse, wavy hair.  </li>
<li> I try to use very little, and I have to run my hands through my hair vigorously after it dries so that it looks dry, and not like I doused it in Elmer&#x27;s glue that morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t weight it down.</li>
<li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like some of the gels I&#x27;ve used and helps define my curls.</li>
<li> Curly, but the ringlets get looser and less defined the longer my hair gets.</li>
<li> I still need a few blast from the hair spray can if I&#x27;m leaving it down</li>
<li> I have limp lifeless hair that needs all the help I can get.  </li>
<li> It holds the curls, isn&#x27;t stiff, and calms the frizzies.  </li>
<li> but it was too stiff for my taste.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
<li> I usually pay $15.00 for a tube of the product.  </li>
<li> Currently hard to find</li>
<li> I know this product has been discontinued by Matrix, however, I think $49.99 for 1 tube is ridiculous.  </li>
<li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <li> works very well with a small amount</li>
    <li> If you have permed hair this is an excellent styling product.  hair stays good all day and looks the same as when the day started.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and this product holds it in place without being sticky or greasy. You do have to be careful bot to put too much product on or it will weigh my hair down.</li>
    <li> For curly to wavy hair this is the product for you.  If your hair during the day becomes droppy put alittle dab on and immediately your hair&#x27;s bounce is back.  I use it on wet and dry hair.  Absolutely wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have limp lifeless hair that needs all the help I can get.  This product helps give my hair the &amp;#34;artificial volume&amp;#34; I need to be able to look like I have a more normal texture of hair.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchase this product and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like some of the gels I&#x27;ve used and helps define my curls. My hair is naturally curly and naturally unruly (does whatever it wants and ignores what I want) and this product does a really good job of helping hold my hair where I ask it to be. I still need a few blast from the hair spray can if I&#x27;m leaving it down but if I&#x27;m pulling it back I can let it go with just this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It drys quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue like some other products do - and best of all it lasts all day!</li>
    <li> Love this product, hard to find elsewhere</li>
    <li> The loosely defined texture cream is an excellent hair gel with a nice fragrance.  Needed to find a new product since KMS changed their fragrance.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I have been using it for a few years now, and it works great on short, or medium length hair.

I have a sister who also uses this product and loves it just as much. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It has always been a good product.  Currently hard to find</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now, however, this price is crazy!  I buy it from my hairdresser for $15 for 5 oz!</li>
    <li> LEAVES HAIR IN ITS PLACE LOVE IT</li>
    <li> This product is so easy to use to get the loose wavey definition that I want. I just take a tiny dab, rub it on my fingers, then comb my fingers through my hair. Lift a little here, scrunch a little there, and I&#x27;m ready to run out the door!</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely manner and was very well packaged.  Have used this product for several years and always purchased from hair salon.  Have found electronic shopping to be more cost effective.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It took me awhile to learn how much to use to get the right effect, but am very happy with my curly, not fuzzy hair : )</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  It is GREAT on my hair and it came quickly in the mail.  I love the way it stops frizz and holds curls.</li>
    <li> I was tuned into this product by my girlfriend who swears by it. Not only does it smell great but it smooths out my curls while still keeping their body.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, coarse, wavy hair.  I use this product when I&#x27;m able to air dry after a few minutes using the diffuser and it works great!  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Read about this in a star magazine. Several actresses, that have fine thin hair like mine, said it works for them. I bought 2, one for me and one for my sister. We love it. It really makes our hair look thicker while keeping it soft.</li>
    <li> Defines curls so well.  No need to make a hair concoction with numerous styling products. It&#x27;s all in one bottle.</li>
    <li> Définit bien les boucles et mélanger à de la mousse le résultat est super dfdsfs efwe efef eEF ERGQ FEQ</li>
    <li> Good control even in humidity.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and use it everyday. Have purchased numerous times and plan to again in the future. Cheaper than purchasing it in stores.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have naturally curly hair.  It holds the curls, isn&#x27;t stiff, and calms the frizzies.  I mix a cocktail of Loosely Defined cream, and about five squirts of biolage exquisite oil, and my hair looks great.  I keep getting compliments.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this light gel works wonders for my hair. Doesn&#x27;t weight it down. Makes it shinny and manageable. Great!</li>
    <li> I know this product has been discontinued by Matrix, however, I think $49.99 for 1 tube is ridiculous.  Before I ordered the product it popped up that there were 3 to the package.  However, it must have meant there were 3 left.  I usually pay $15.00 for a tube of the product.  Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> This was suggested to me by Matrix to replace their Glazing product they discontinued.  If you want to spike your hair, this would probably do the trick but it was too stiff for my taste.</li>
    <li> Wife has me get this for her. She loves it.</li>
    <li> Has a great hold and smells great too!</li>
    <li> Great hair product for giving body to fine limp hair</li>
    <li> I was surprised by the small size when I opened the box, though I knew it was five ounces.  The cost was pretty high, but bought it because of the good reviews and like this manufacturers Amplify hairspray so much.  It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;build up&amp;#34; so my hair feels clean even after a couple of days spray on it.  I thought the mousse would be the same, but thats not true.  My hair feels gritty after I comb it out after shampooing and using this product.  I may as well go back to my old Tressame mousee which costs less and has twice the content.  I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
    <li> My hair type: Curly, but the ringlets get looser and less defined the longer my hair gets. If air dried, rarely get curls above the ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a mega-hold product. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the &amp;#34;loosely defined&amp;#34; thing. I try to use very little, and I have to run my hands through my hair vigorously after it dries so that it looks dry, and not like I doused it in Elmer&#x27;s glue that morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, once that&#x27;s done I have glossy, incredibly defined curls that start higher above my ears than  my usual loose ringlets do.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and this stuff works great. It doesn&#x27;t get crunchy and wet looking. It stays natural looking but really defines the curls and holds them in place. It controls the frizz pretty good and relaxes the flyaway hairs. Wish my salon sold this stuff!</li>
