    <li> This lotion is amazing! You will see instant results after using it your first time. I do recommend waiting until you have a good base tan before using it however. I love how the lotion squirts out of the bottle with the perfect amount. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is sometimes it leaves a little orange/brownish residue on my hands, but if you wipe your hands down well after using the lotion it shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.
