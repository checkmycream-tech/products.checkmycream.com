      <li>Many Thanks AAA+++</li>
      <li>I was looking to find it at a more reasonable price since it can get pricey</li>
      <li>Seller awesome but product was not a good product for colored treated hair.</li>
      <li>Nothing else has worked as well, and it&#x27;s worth the price to me.</li>

      <li>;)</li>
      <li>thanks for prompt delivery !</li>
      <li>It took 3 days of using another shampoo to clean it completely.</li>
      <li>Shampoo has a great fragrance (at least to me) but doesn&#x27;t lather very well</li>
      <li>I only gave it 3-stars because it did not seem to give my fine, shoulder-length hair very much volume.</li>
      <li>It was exactly like described and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>and I believe it aids in thickening; actually quite affordable compared to other natural/organic products; smells GREAT to me     Cons:</li>
      <li>Hair feels and looks good but not better than a Neutrogena.  </li>
      <li>[[ASIN:B000EMDK6K Aveda Pure Abundance Volumizing Shampoo, 8.5-Ounce Bottle]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also use the Aveda Pure Abundance conditioner.</li>
      <li>Which helped, BUT I AM OFFICIALLY CONVERTED to Aveda Pure Abundance shampoo.</li>
      <li>The shampoo works fine, but it has a very different smell that I was not expecting.</li>
      <li>I like this shampoo so much.</li>
      <li>Very nourishing for your hair.</li>
      <li>Really does add volume to thinning hair.</li>
      <li>Well i dont have to do that so much now.</li>
      <li>NOT ANY BETTER THAN OTHER SHAMPOO&#x27;S</li>
      <li>Adds a lot of body to my thin hair and smells really nice!</li>
      <li>Returned because I did not like how it left my hair feeling full of product.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a new shampoo!</li>
      <li>I highly suggest you smell this shampoo in the store before purchasing.</li>
      <li>The price is a bit high but it does seem to help.</li>
      <li>After having tried a number of other natural/organic hair products that would actully make my thin, fine, and sometimes oily hair look nice, this is an absolute necessity in my shower.</li>
      <li>Not really anything special that I couldn&#x27;t have found at Walmart Or Target for 1/10th of the price.</li>
      <li>It smells great and rinses out quickly, but as for working on my hair....very disappointing!</li>
      <li>but unfortunately this is even higher than their own site.</li>
      <li>At first I thought it was the weather, but the second time I washed my hair, I woke up with matted hair the next morning, and I realized the problem was Pure Abundance.  </li>
      <li>I have been searching for quite some time for a product that would help me hair as it is straight and fine but thick.  </li>
      <li>Actually meant to buy the hairspray (which I really like) but accidentally bought the shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Try it only if you have straight oily hair that is not colored.  </li>
      <li>Still, I overlooked all of this because I am on the quest for a volumizing shampoo with natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>I didnt really feel my hair thicker, But haven&#x27;t used constantly.</li>
      <li>My flat hair was much more lively after only a few uses!</li>
      <li>This shampoo really volumizes my fine, thin hair to give it the oomph</li>
      <li>Solve, a clay-based shampoo, left my hair incredibly soft, with lots of volume.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The scent is pure dark heaven.</li>
      <li>My hair is thin and fine.</li>
      <li>This product which is pricey by the time I paid the S&amp;H,  does not deliver the results I was looking for, namely increased volume in my fine, thin hair.  </li>
      <li>Also hopefully your mileage may vary, but the sales clerks in the Aveda store were pushy and rude - just something to be aware of!       </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> great shampoo really like this shampoo asit does not contain a lot of chemichals and does a great job thanks</li>
    <li> I have been searching for quite some time for a product that would help me hair as it is straight and fine but thick.  I love this shampoo.  Natural ingredients and smells good.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo....thanks for prompt delivery !</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses this on my hair and it works very well on thin hair. adds volume too. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Actually meant to buy the hairspray (which I really like) but accidentally bought the shampoo.  Shampoo has a great fragrance (at least to me) but doesn&#x27;t lather very well so feels like I have to apply alot.  Hair feels and looks good but not better than a Neutrogena.  In the end, a big premium to pay so can&#x27;t heartily endorse.  Better love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does make a difference to get a fuller look of hair for me personally. My hair is thin and fine. It looks and feels thicker than any other product(s) that I&#x27;ve used before.  My hair is shiny and has a nice healthy look to it now.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year and noticed a difference when I use a different shampoo.  Unless I find something that&#x27;s similar but priced less, I&#x27;ll continue buy this product! I also combine Aveda Phomollient with Aveda Volumizing shampoo to make a longer lasting hair style. Very good products together! ;)</li>
    <li> Fine, color treated hair is my type of hair. I perused Google looking for the best shampoo for me, and all results went to Aveda. I used it the first time a couple of weeks ago, and it was superb. My hair has volume, shine and keeps a curl. This is just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no minerals or anything untoward in this shampoo, and it seems to be the most pure of all shampoos. Aveda has an exemplary reputation, and the company has many customers who are giving positive reviews. The cost is higher than what I usually pay, but then you pay for quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 05-18-15</li>
    <li> The shampoo works fine, but it has a very different smell that I was not expecting. It smells kind of woodsy/spicy.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000EMDK6K Aveda Pure Abundance Volumizing Shampoo, 8.5-Ounce Bottle]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is truly the best.  It has great texture, BEAUTIFUL scent, and truly adds volume to my hair.  I also use the Aveda Pure Abundance conditioner. I will never go back to regular shampoos and conditioners.</li>
    <li> This product gives a lot of volume and I was happy the first time I used it until I went outside for a hike.  When I came back, my hair was all tangled up and looking like a real mess.  At first I thought it was the weather, but the second time I washed my hair, I woke up with matted hair the next morning, and I realized the problem was Pure Abundance.  I have fine hair that has a tendency to go curly, and this product combination (shampoo + conditioner) proved to be disastrous for me.  Try it only if you have straight oily hair that is not colored.  Otherwise, stay away from it.</li>
    <li> This product works great, I can use it while being pregnant. It does not contain DEA which studies are showing may cause cancer and interfere with fetal brain development. I love the smell too!!!</li>
    <li> Got this for my son&#x27;s girlfriend for Christmas. She was so excited to get her favorite shampoo. She loves this product.</li>
    <li> I have very fine (baby fine) hair. I spent years looking for a shampoo that would give me the volume I wanted - this is it. I use this shampoo every day and the conditioner once a week. I love the smell and the way it makes my hair look and feel!!! Highly recommend to any one with fine, or thin hair!!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. Really does add volume to thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I highly suggest you smell this shampoo in the store before purchasing. I usually take a risk when I read reviews about scent, but don&#x27;t do it this time! This shampoo is strong! My husband equated it to a pack of menthol cigarettes, it is *NOT* for everyone. Also hopefully your mileage may vary, but the sales clerks in the Aveda store were pushy and rude - just something to be aware of!       Still, I overlooked all of this because I am on the quest for a volumizing shampoo with natural ingredients. At first I was super impressed with this shampoo. My flat hair was much more lively after only a few uses! However, after a couple of weeks my hair started looking not only flat but stringy, and I had to use more and more product to get the original results. This wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if it wasn&#x27;t so expensive! Needless to say the price combined with the smell put me off of this product.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and leaves my hair feeling great!  Quick and easy delivery!  Would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a new shampoo!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a couple of years.  It gives my hair alot of body.  I am sold on it and would not switch to another product.</li>
    <li> Smells nice. Gives hair more volume.</li>
    <li> i tried bumble and bumble volumizing for years... Which helped, BUT I AM OFFICIALLY CONVERTED to Aveda Pure Abundance shampoo. This shampoo really volumizes my fine, thin hair to give it the oomph so i dont look balding, like i am always paranoid that i might look that way (strategic parting of the hair, dry shampoo to keep it from being greasy, etc...) Well i dont have to do that so much now. P.A. feels good, it smells good and the main ingredient is marshmallow... We&#x27;ve got a winner. However i got mine for 16$ at an aveda store so check that out. I will look into the conditioner when mine runs out.</li>
    <li> IFor being Aveda, O was expecting more of it. I didnt really feel my hair thicker, But haven&#x27;t used constantly. I guess I&#x27;ll give another try.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to replace Redken&#x27;s discontinued Solve line.  Solve, a clay-based shampoo, left my hair incredibly soft, with lots of volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aveda&#x27;s Pure Abundance, however, weighed my hair down and made it difficult to comb when wet.</li>
    <li> The smell isn&#x27;t my favorite. It does get your hair REALLY clean though. My hair isn&#x27;t that oily though so it would dry it out a bit. It think it might be more helpful for someone with hair that tends to get oily.</li>
    <li> Pros: natural ingredients; very effective at cleaning my hair and I believe it aids in thickening; actually quite affordable compared to other natural/organic products; smells GREAT to me     Cons: wish it were less expensive (so does my husband lol)     Bottom line: After having tried a number of other natural/organic hair products that would actully make my thin, fine, and sometimes oily hair look nice, this is an absolute necessity in my shower. Nothing else has worked as well, and it&#x27;s worth the price to me. I recommend it to others on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> Love this product, aroma-5 star, does great things for my hair, and the company is green. The best price on Amazon is less than a dollar cheaper than the store. Retail price is $15. You get 2 free samples for each order and is your order is $50 or more free shipping. Please shop there, they are honest and deserve your support.</li>
    <li> I think this shampoo volumizes your hair a bit, smells good, and is generally a nice product.  The price is a bit high but it does seem to help.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I liked if!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent Seller  Many Thanks AAA+++</li>
    <li> If you have fine hair and need volume then this is NOT for you. I was excited to try this organic product but was so dissapointed. I got it on 8/3 and didn&#x27;t start using it until the end of August, so i cant return it cuase the deadline was 9/3. I have fine hair and I need to wash it everyday otherwise it looks greasy. Usually my wash lasts a whole day but with this shampoo it would last a few hours! I washed my hair at night and by the time I got to work the next morning my hair looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed it in days! I went to get my hair cut and my hairdresser noticed my hair was lifeless. It took 3 days of using another shampoo to clean it completely. By far this has been the worst shampoo I have tired that is not store brand.</li>
    <li> NOT ANY BETTER THAN OTHER SHAMPOO&#x27;S</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. It makes my hair healthy, doesn&#x27;t strip my color, and gives me volume</li>
    <li> This is a great product but I just want to say that the price on here is more expensive than you can get at the official Aveda site! I was looking to find it at a more reasonable price since it can get pricey but unfortunately this is even higher than their own site.</li>
    <li> It was exactly like described and fast shipping. However, The product says it works well on colo-treated hair and I get my hair highlighted and the product itself faded the color out quickly!! Never used again. Seller awesome but product was not a good product for colored treated hair.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re craving a sensual experience but short on company this shampoo comes in darn close.  The scent is pure dark heaven.</li>
    <li> This is a fine product for soft,shining and healthy hair.  I only gave it 3-stars because it did not seem to give my fine, shoulder-length hair very much volume. Would work wonderful for someone with thicker hair.</li>
    <li> Very nourishing for your hair. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot, as with less expensive shampoos. My hair is short, so I use about a dimes size twice.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  Cleans wonderfully and feels and smells great!</li>
    <li> I thought that this product would do wonders I guess. Not really anything special that I couldn&#x27;t have found at Walmart Or Target for 1/10th of the price.</li>
    <li> This product which is pricey by the time I paid the S&amp;H,  does not deliver the results I was looking for, namely increased volume in my fine, thin hair.  It smells great and rinses out quickly, but as for working on my hair....very disappointing!</li>
    <li> Adds a lot of body to my thin hair and smells really nice!</li>
    <li> Returned because I did not like how it left my hair feeling full of product.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo so much.</li>
