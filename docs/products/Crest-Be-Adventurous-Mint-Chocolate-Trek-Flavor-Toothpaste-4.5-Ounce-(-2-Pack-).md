      <li>wife said, “I love the mint chocolate toothpaste!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m here to tell you that if you have any aversion to &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; flavored toothpastes, you will LOVE this one!  </li>
      <li>Would also love to see these flavors in the restoration toothpastes too!  </li>
      <li>I love brushing my teeth with this Choc -mint flavored toothpaste!  </li>
      <li>Has nice balance between mint and chocolate.  </li>
      <li>flavor was nice</li>
      <li>so this is a nice change.</li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>but I promise it is magical goodness inside your mouth.</li>
      <li>It tastes more of Oreo cookied than just chocolate.</li>
      <li>Who needs dessert at night when you have this fantastic tasting toothpaste!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the chocolate mint flavor.  </li>
      <li>As delicious as this toothpaste is, is it actually working?</li>
      <li>but my kids enjoyed the vanilla version.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like a gag gift than a toothpaste</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>two daughters enjoyed the change of brushing with a chocolate taste as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad Amazon has some in stock.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say I love it</li>
      <li>My kids love this flavor.</li>
      <li>The women in my life really enjoyed the Crest</li>
      <li>creamy and very sweet, Mint Chocolate Trek (aptly names Be Adventurous) had a strong chocolate bean flavor, like powered chocolate, hits you just as you start to brush with the mint.</li>
      <li>This tasted exactly like mint chocolate chip ice cream in some sort of good for your teeth majestic paste.</li>
      <li>The problem is that when I&#x27;m brushing my teeth - and maybe this is just me - I expect to feel clean not like I just ate very strong tapioca pudding.</li>
      <li>Great for people that taste buds are sensitive after chemotherapy.</li>
      <li>Also, would love to see more flavors, as I really can&#x27;t stand the mint that is used in most toothpastes and it is so nice to be able to have fun flavors for adults and teens.  </li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite of the three Crest Be Adventurous toothpastes!  </li>
      <li>:  Since my wife is going to buy this I will use it occasionally for a pleasant mint chocolate adventure in my mouth :)</li>
      <li>So very grateful for this amazing flavor.  </li>
      <li>but fortunately I found it here.  </li>
      <li>Tastes really good,  it makes me actually want to brush my teeth more than once a week.</li>
      <li>Yum :) It&#x27;s a nice change from the regular mint toothpastes (I&#x27;m not a fan of super strong mint).</li>
      <li>I associate that overly-strong minty flavor with clean teeth.</li>
      <li>I do not think it is sickly sweet.  </li>
      <li>but I just didn&#x27;t feel like my mouth was fresh and clean after brushing.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a clean, fresh feeling in your mouth after brushing, this isn&#x27;t the toothpaste for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nice to have more subtle flavors than most toothpastes.</li>
      <li>So kind of a waste unless you get better expiration dates</li>
      <li>but it leaves my mouth feeling both clean and most importantly NOT dry.  </li>
      <li>I love how it tastes like you are eating a candy bar, It is hands down my favorite, however I deducted a star as I was sent toothpaste that expires in 3 months, and I wont be using two tubes before then.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for people who dislike regular toothpaste but love chocolate!</li>
      <li>This is hard to find in stores, so I am happy I stocked up here.</li>
      <li>so I was pretty excited to try all these new Crest Be toothpaste flavors.</li>
      <li>I love the taste and it definitely freshens and cleans.</li>
      <li>is 2x-5x as much!</li>
      <li>so I definitely don&#x27;t need more of that.</li>
      <li>Bought two, a little pricy, but it&#x27;s better to pay a little more for a flavor I love, than to have to be fitted for dentures!</li>
      <li>Brushing my teeth has become a pleasurable activity and not so much a chore!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve really missed the Vanilla Expressions toothpaste and this makes up for it!  </li>
      <li>Thanks Crest!</li>
      <li>Hope they keep making this, as a straight chocolate version from another manufacturer</li>
      <li>This toothpaste is however bearable in an invisible market for what I really want.</li>
      <li>My daughter loves this and it really helps get her to brush her teeth.</li>
      <li>Guess I&#x27;m used to a harsher toothpaste that makes me feel like my mouth has been really</li>
      <li>It leaves a nice minty taste in my mouth which is not at all like the taste left by the regular Crest toothpastes.  </li>
      <li>I ended up ordering a full year supply since it has been discontinued and do not look forward to having to switch back to anything else when all the lots expire.</li>
      <li>I also like the kids strawberry and watermelon toothpaste but the tube on this stuff looks a little more adult.</li>
      <li>that makes you crave water to get rid of, but it&#x27;s less strong.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m lucky enough to have found them for only 98 cents</li>
      <li>Or is it just a sweet little novelty?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m open to trying new stuff</li>
      <li>I despise the sharp, harsh mint of most toothpastes but this one is nothing like it.  </li>

<li> The only thing I can say is that Crest should use a little less mint to get less of a mint taste and more of the flavor taste.  </li>
<li> Not sure I&#x27;ll use up two whole tubes before it expired.</li>
<li> the other hand, the males who tried based on my asking them to were the total opposite.</li>
<li> The only caveat is you&#x27;re left with no fresh minty tingle afterwards.</li>
<li> I already suffer from dry mouth</li>
<li> All the mint/peppermint/spearmint flavored toothpastes dry my mouth out.</li>
<li> Couple that with the numerous artificial colors (yellow 5 lake, yellow 5, red 40 lake, blue 1 lake, blue 1) and ingredients (sacchrin, sulfate, etc)</li>
<li> None of them gave as descriptive answers as the women other than, “nope, don’t like it”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> it feels wrong for the first 10 seconds or so.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m sorry I can no longer purchase it locally and hope Amazon carries it for a very long time.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
<li> Regular mint toothpaste always leaves my mouth dry and makes everything I eat/drink for the next hour taste terrible.</li>
<li> I am really tired of mint toothpaste.</li>
<li> Mint Chocolate toothpaste is weird.</li>
<li> So sad it&#x27;s been discontinued.  </li>
<li> What I wasn&#x27;t expecting was how wrong they tasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I hate mint and cinnamon flavoring.</li>
<li> This toothpaste sounds like a horrible idea</li>

    <li> AWESOME flavor!!!!  LOVE it!!!!</li>
    <li> Mint Chocolate toothpaste is weird. It is like my brain doesn&#x27;t want to associate that flavor with brushing so it feels wrong for the first 10 seconds or so.  Regular mint toothpaste always leaves my mouth dry and makes everything I eat/drink for the next hour taste terrible. Not so with this.  I can&#x27;t say I love it but it leaves my mouth feeling both clean and most importantly NOT dry.  I&#x27;ll take that. I also like the kids strawberry and watermelon toothpaste but the tube on this stuff looks a little more adult.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh this stuff is delicious! It tastes like chocolate candy canes. Yum :) It&#x27;s a nice change from the regular mint toothpastes (I&#x27;m not a fan of super strong mint). Only thing is that it says it expires sooner than I thought it would, and I got two.. Not sure I&#x27;ll use up two whole tubes before it expired. I ended up giving one of them to my mom lol.</li>
    <li> This is the best flavored toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever had. Crest is an excellent brand. They just made a mistake to discontinue the line. I&#x27;m glad Amazon has some in stock. They came to my rescue.</li>
    <li> Best flavor of toothpaste out there for adults and kids!  So sad it&#x27;s been discontinued.  I am even giving this as a stocking stuffer to my nieces and nephews!</li>
    <li> The women in my life really enjoyed the Crest® Be Adventurous™ Mint Chocolate Trek flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife said, “I love the mint chocolate toothpaste! It tastes like mint chocolate chip ice cream. I have looked forward to brushing my teeth each night so I can use it” and ,” I even brushed my teeth with it once in the middle of the day to cure a chocolate craving. Who needs dessert at night when you have this fantastic tasting toothpaste!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My two daughters enjoyed the change of brushing with a chocolate taste as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, the males who tried based on my asking them to were the total opposite. None of them gave as descriptive answers as the women other than, “nope, don’t like it”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flavor was nice but I just didn&#x27;t feel like my mouth was fresh and clean after brushing. Guess I&#x27;m used to a harsher toothpaste that makes me feel like my mouth has been really scrubbed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize:&lt;br /&gt;Flavor: Tasted just like advertised; If you like mint chocolate flavor you’ll like this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;End Result: If you are just going for flavor when brushing your teeth or trying to satisfy a Chocolate mint craving, this toothpaste is for you. If you are looking for a clean, fresh feeling in your mouth after brushing, this isn&#x27;t the toothpaste for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I continue to use it?:  Since my wife is going to buy this I will use it occasionally for a pleasant mint chocolate adventure in my mouth :)</li>
    <li> Tastes really good,  it makes me actually want to brush my teeth more than once a week.</li>
    <li> I hate mint and cinnamon flavoring. This toothpaste is however bearable in an invisible market for what I really want. I use this and it&#x27;s okay. I still feel like it leaves that feeling in your mouth that makes you crave water to get rid of, but it&#x27;s less strong. My daughter says it&#x27;s like a dinner mint from Olive Garden.</li>
    <li> I am really tired of mint toothpaste. This is a great change.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m open to trying new stuff so I was pretty excited to try all these new Crest Be toothpaste flavors. Like licking the wall at Willy Wonka&#x27;s I gleefully brushed my teeth over and over to give them all a shot. What I wasn&#x27;t expecting was how wrong they tasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very creamy and very sweet, Mint Chocolate Trek (aptly names Be Adventurous) had a strong chocolate bean flavor, like powered chocolate, hits you just as you start to brush with the mint. The problem is that when I&#x27;m brushing my teeth - and maybe this is just me - I expect to feel clean not like I just ate very strong tapioca pudding. I felt I was supposed to swallow because it tasted like dessert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just not a fan of these flavors. Couple that with the numerous artificial colors (yellow 5 lake, yellow 5, red 40 lake, blue 1 lake, blue 1) and ingredients (sacchrin, sulfate, etc) and I just don&#x27;t see how I would recommend this to anyone. It&#x27;s more like a gag gift than a toothpaste and I think we will likely see these come and go on the shelves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample of this product was provided by Crest and BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> Nice to have more subtle flavors than most toothpastes.</li>
    <li> Delicious!  I love the chocolate mint flavor.  Yum.  This is hard to find in stores, so I am happy I stocked up here.</li>
    <li> I love brushing my teeth with this Choc -mint flavored toothpaste!  Bought two, a little pricy, but it&#x27;s better to pay a little more for a flavor I love, than to have to be fitted for dentures!</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite of the three Crest Be Adventurous toothpastes!  It leaves a nice minty taste in my mouth which is not at all like the taste left by the regular Crest toothpastes.  Brushing my teeth has become a pleasurable activity and not so much a chore!  I&#x27;m sorry I can no longer purchase it locally and hope Amazon carries it for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste! I love how it tastes like you are eating a candy bar, It is hands down my favorite, however I deducted a star as I was sent toothpaste that expires in 3 months, and I wont be using two tubes before then. So kind of a waste unless you get better expiration dates</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this stuff.  I scour stores for it constantly.  Can no longer find it on the shelves but fortunately I found it here.  I despise the sharp, harsh mint of most toothpastes but this one is nothing like it.  I hope the continue to make this because I don&#x27;t think I can go back to the regular flavors!</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of mint or cinnamon,  so this is a nice change.</li>
    <li> Great for people that taste buds are sensitive after chemotherapy. No mint burning in your mouth</li>
    <li> This is the best toothpaste ever!  Can&#x27;t wait to brush my teeth now!  Highly recommended for people who dislike regular toothpaste but love chocolate!</li>
    <li> The taste is great, the kids, my husband and I love the flavor!  The only thing I can say is that Crest should use a little less mint to get less of a mint taste and more of the flavor taste.  Also, would love to see more flavors, as I really can&#x27;t stand the mint that is used in most toothpastes and it is so nice to be able to have fun flavors for adults and teens.  Would also love to see these flavors in the restoration toothpastes too!  I&#x27;ve really missed the Vanilla Expressions toothpaste and this makes up for it!  Thanks Crest!</li>
    <li> I like this flavor.  I do not think it is sickly sweet.  It leaves my mouth refreshed.  It tastes more of Oreo cookied than just chocolate.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this and it really helps get her to brush her teeth. My son hates it and will have nothing to do with it,  I guess it&#x27;s a matter of taste. Three stars for getting my girl to brush.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste sounds like a horrible idea but I promise it is magical goodness inside your mouth. This tasted exactly like mint chocolate chip ice cream in some sort of good for your teeth majestic paste. I ended up ordering a full year supply since it has been discontinued and do not look forward to having to switch back to anything else when all the lots expire.</li>
    <li> My kids love this flavor.</li>
    <li> The Mint Chocolate Trek flavor is REALLY delicious and reminds me of chocolate mousse. The only caveat is you&#x27;re left with no fresh minty tingle afterwards. Once you spit it out, there is almost no residual flavor in your mouth. I know this is purely psychological, but it makes me question whether it&#x27;s actually working. I associate that overly-strong minty flavor with clean teeth. As delicious as this toothpaste is, is it actually working? Or is it just a sweet little novelty? I&#x27;m not sure. But try it out for yourself. It&#x27;s definitely the mint chocolate flavor it advertises.</li>
    <li> Has nice balance between mint and chocolate.  I just dislike the taste of minty toothpast.  Tried their vanilla mint a decade back, and didn&#x27;t care for it but my kids enjoyed the vanilla version.  Hope they keep making this, as a straight chocolate version from another manufacturer is 2x-5x as much!</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. It has the perfect balance of mint and chocolate. I&#x27;m lucky enough to have found them for only 98 cents and I&#x27;m not talking about a 99 cent store. I bought 4. I love the taste and it definitely freshens and cleans. You can taste it. I must admit I use a big gob of it when I&#x27;m brushing. It tastes too good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m here to tell you that if you have any aversion to &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; flavored toothpastes, you will LOVE this one!  All the mint/peppermint/spearmint flavored toothpastes dry my mouth out. I already suffer from dry mouth so I definitely don&#x27;t need more of that. But this one??  This one is a God send!  So very grateful for this amazing flavor.  I no longer dread brushing my teeth!</li>
