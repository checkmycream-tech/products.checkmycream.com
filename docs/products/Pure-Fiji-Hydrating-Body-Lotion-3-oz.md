      <li>Love this product line!  </li>
      <li>The lotion is very hydrating and the smell is DELICIOUS!  </li>
      <li>This product is OK, but will not buy again.  </li>
      <li>Try it!! :)</li>
      <li>It is not like many overpowering scented body lotions that wreak of alcohol scents.  </li>
      <li>The smell is heavenly -- exotic coconut rather than a cloying scent.</li>
      <li>I love this lotion...</li>
      <li>However, the aroma from it is lovely.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>It smells so good and it very hydrating on your skin.</li>
      <li>This lotion is fairly light...</li>
      <li>It has a light coconut scent that is just right!  </li>
      <li>The lotion is not greasy, it absorbs fairly quickly, and it goes on smoothly.  </li>
      <li>When I think of coconut oil , I think of SUPER rich and hydrating.</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite lotion.</li>
      <li>It is light smelling and absorbs right away.  </li>
      <li>Very hydrating and the scent stays on you all day!!</li>
      <li>It seems that it takes forever to be absorbed into the body.</li>
      <li>I like smelling my skin throughout the day to smell the fresh scent of the lotion.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ever used, but they are absolutely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was looking for a more rich product, that is why I gave it only 4 stars.</li>
      <li>I like to pair this with the coconut sugar scrub - not that you need lotion right after using the sugar scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really like this body lotion!  </li>
      <li>Nice Coconut scent but not as moisturizing as I expected.</li>
      <li>Smells good, not sure why</li>
      <li>Need to find a lotion that really smells like coconut.</li>
      <li>Perhaps it is because I&#x27;m a young-old lady and too much in a hurry to get on with things.</li>
      <li>This line is made with coconut milk and oils and it is very nourishing.</li>
      <li>but my bottle strangely had a sticker on it that said &amp;#34;tester&amp;#34; but other than that love this product, it smells very fresh</li>
      <li>The lotion itself is really indulgent, a little luxury I enjoy when I want to treat myself.</li>
      <li>Guava is new, so I don&#x27;t know what it smells like - fruity or floral.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kept my skin soft ever since I started using it!</li>
      <li>All of the Pure Fiji products DO come directly from Fiji, although they have distributors different places.</li>
      <li>I discovered this product for myself in Fiji on our honeymoon nearly seven years ago and have used it ever since.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not trying to get you too excited, this is definitely the most expensive sugar scrub, lotion, body spray, body oil and shampoo/conditioner</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had a problem with my body lotion not absorbing quick enough.</li>
      <li>It makes your skin very soft with regular use.</li>
      <li>We live in a dry climate and it seems to be working well.</li>

    <li> Smells wonderful, makes my skin feel wonderful</li>
    <li> Good lotion. Smells good, not sure why but my bottle strangely had a sticker on it that said &amp;#34;tester&amp;#34; but other than that love this product, it smells very fresh and it&#x27;s not too oily!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!! I tried it in Vegas....found it on Amazon and have been hooked ever since!! Very hydrating and the scent stays on you all day!! Try it!! :)</li>
    <li> I love this lotion... this is the second bottle I have purchased.  The smell of coconuts reminds me of being on vacation.</li>
    <li> I really like this body lotion!  It has a light coconut scent that is just right!  It is not like many overpowering scented body lotions that wreak of alcohol scents.  It smells milky with coconut.  I like smelling my skin throughout the day to smell the fresh scent of the lotion.  The lotion is not greasy, it absorbs fairly quickly, and it goes on smoothly.  It&#x27;s kept my skin soft ever since I started using it!</li>
    <li> Nice Coconut scent but not as moisturizing as I expected.</li>
    <li> Smells like a vacation in the tropics.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It smells so good and it very hydrating on your skin.</li>
    <li> Love it! The lotion is very hydrating and the smell is DELICIOUS!  You will not be disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> Did not like product, scent was not what I expected at all. Will never purchase item ever again. Need to find a lotion that really smells like coconut.</li>
    <li> This product is OK, but will not buy again.  It is just too greasy feeling after being applied. I was afraid to touch anything as I would leave an imprint of my finger.  It seems that it takes forever to be absorbed into the body. Perhaps it is because I&#x27;m a young-old lady and too much in a hurry to get on with things. However, the aroma from it is lovely. Delivery was very prompt as usual from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I Love this Lotion!  I went to Fiji last year and this is what they used I our resort and I have been hooked ever since.  Tried to buy a creeper version at Bath &amp; Body Works but NOTHING compares.</li>
    <li> The best lotion in the world and it smells great too</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a friend of mine and she loved it!  Great product. We live in a dry climate and it seems to be working well.</li>
    <li> Love this product line!  I&#x27;m 65 and using the lotion, shower gel, and butter has left my skin looking much younger and healthier!!</li>
    <li> I like this lotion...it isn&#x27;t heavy and soaks in well. When I think of coconut oil , I think of SUPER rich and hydrating. This lotion is fairly light...I was looking for a more rich product, that is why I gave it only 4 stars. Also, it is quite pricy</li>
    <li> All of the Pure Fiji products DO come directly from Fiji, although they have distributors different places. Here in the states they come from CO. I discovered this product for myself in Fiji on our honeymoon nearly seven years ago and have used it ever since. It&#x27;s my one indulgence I never feel guilty about. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with my body lotion not absorbing quick enough. I find that the body butter takes longer to soak in, but not the lotion. I like to pair this with the coconut sugar scrub - not that you need lotion right after using the sugar scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEFORE YOU BUY IT ON AMAZON, do a price comparison with [...] for a couple of reasons: 1) it&#x27;s usually cheaper, and 2) you can accumulate \\&quot;points\\&quot; which you can apply for a discount from one order to the next. Also, if you sign up for their emails you&#x27;ll receive notice of their discounts throughout the year making it less expensive still. I&#x27;m not trying to get you too excited, this is definitely the most expensive sugar scrub, lotion, body spray, body oil and shampoo/conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, but they are absolutely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of different fragrances. It&#x27;s a coconut sugar scrub, meaning little, tiny pieces of coconut are in the mix. The \\&quot;fruity\\&quot; fragrances are Starfruit, Mango, Pineapple. Coconut is just that - coconut. Guava is new, so I don&#x27;t know what it smells like - fruity or floral. If you like patchouli, you&#x27;ll like Island Bliss. The rest of the fragrances are floral.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite lotion. The smell is heavenly -- exotic coconut rather than a cloying scent. The lotion itself is really indulgent, a little luxury I enjoy when I want to treat myself.</li>
    <li> This line is made with coconut milk and oils and it is very nourishing. It makes your skin very soft with regular use.</li>
    <li> Great Product according  to my Lady Friend!!</li>
    <li> Simply love this lotion and scent! My girlfriend turned me on to this lotion last spring and I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for the coconut smell.  It is light smelling and absorbs right away.  I will buy this lotion again.</li>
