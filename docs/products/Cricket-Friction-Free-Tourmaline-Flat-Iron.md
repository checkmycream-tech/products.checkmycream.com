      <li>The plates glide over the hair smoothly without catching.  </li>

      <li>Cheaply finished.</li>
      <li>Gives my hair a nice finish, and I can make even the shortest section straight or curled as I desire.</li>
      <li>Overall, I am happy I made the purchase</li>
      <li>It is really smooth on my hair and it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.</li>
      <li>This is perfect size for that, and a few pieces for face framing.</li>
      <li>When my hair started to frizz, I just used the mini travel flat iron and it worked great.</li>
      <li>This flat iron worked great for about 6 to 7 weeks or so.</li>
      <li>the iron itself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats very quickly and very hot.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for short hair to give just the right curl too.</li>
      <li>I was really hoping this flat iron would be an ideal gift for my mom.</li>
      <li>Just the right size for quick touch ups and really great if you have short hair.  </li>
      <li>It heats up fast, and does a really great job on my fairly short, fine hair.</li>
      <li>All the function of a full sized unit packed into practically a travel size.</li>
      <li>Heats up quick and gets super hot!</li>
      <li>It gets very hot and straightens well.</li>
      <li>I was in need of a ceramic flat iron and this one seemed perfect for my short hair.</li>
      <li>Flat iron is comparable to one I purchased from my beautician and better price!&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied.</li>
      <li>Upon examination, this is clearly not the most well-made device (the plastic seems very cheap and</li>
      <li>Wife loves it, because while it is small and light, it does a great job</li>
      <li>But it heats up fast and is easy to hold.</li>
      <li>It gets too hot very quickly, so I have to turn it on, quickly start curling then unplug before it gets too hot.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is perfect for small jobs, short hair and repairs - I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
      <li>She has super fine, coils and waves and does not need as high a heat as my own medium coarse kinky, curly hair.</li>
      <li>It gets so hot that it takes a while to cool off</li>
      <li>I think it gives a more natural look, than trying to achieve with an iron</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t burn fingers holding, and I like that the plates go right to the end of metal and</li>
      <li>price arrived super fast</li>
      <li>and I was able to get it straight with this flat iron and was also able to hold at an angle and get a soft curl.</li>
      <li>but it does get really hot.</li>
      <li>But it doesn&#x27;t get too hot for my hair.</li>
      <li>Love it, my second one.  </li>
      <li>Then it started to get extremely hot.</li>
      <li>I thought it may have been a fluke with my first appliance, but it&#x27;s happened again, and I hope to return and see if they can either repair or replace.</li>
      <li>It is a great retouch flat iron and does NOT work as a regular one, even more if you have long hair</li>
      <li>Though I love the ease and heat temp of this flat iron, I have found that after a year of use, it stops heating.</li>
      <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
      <li>I love that I can get close to my skull and have enough precision to create bangs that follow the curve of my head (instead of bangs that stick straight out).  </li>
      <li>I also like how fast it gets hot.</li>
      <li>Every hair stylist that has used it loves it and wants to know where I got it.</li>
      <li>Very nice&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
      <li>But, it really does work well &amp; straightens my hair</li>
      <li>But I want to say thanks to Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Because I have only used it to iron my bangs, I can&#x27;t speak to whether it gets too hot or how it does with a full head of hair.  </li>
      <li>It comes packed in a rectangular box -- not the clear plastic that drugstore flat irons come in -- so you could wrap it pretty easily to give as a gift.  </li>
      <li>This is a fabulous flat iron.  </li>
      <li>Turns out only the full size version has temp control.  </li>
      <li>One of the main reasons I bought it is because it said it was friction-free and wouldn&#x27;t pull your hair.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t a replacement for your full sized flat iron.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll try to find a more solidly built flat iron with variable temperature control.</li>
      <li>Cute little iron.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a shame since she was able to style her hair exactly as she wished with this iron compared to larger, standard flat irons.</li>
      <li>product does not have variable heat settings, only &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;off.&amp;#34; I have course thick hair and usually want a straightener that gets fairly hot, but this one works perfectly on my bangs.</li>
      <li>This is a very tiny flat iron - you can easily tuck it into your purse.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE the small size.</li>
      <li>It actually gets quite hot and does the job just fine--I don&#x27;t even have to take 3-4 passes over one are of hair.</li>
      <li>the reason I did not give it 5 stars: It gets hot, not just the plates but also the outside -</li>
      <li>regular flat iron doesn&#x27;t take much space anyway, so I thought this doesn&#x27;t worth it for me.</li>
      <li>- I&#x27;m guessing no bigger than 8 inches long and my hands can grip it comfortably.</li>
      <li>Worth it when needing an over night stay bag or camping and limited on your luggage space.</li>
      <li>you have to be more careful that the outside of it does not hit bare skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I assume this was on purpose, being as the reason for the return was clearly stated on the return label.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take long to get hot.</li>
      <li>It works alright for what it is, but all images on amazon and the packaging for the straightener were completely misleading.</li>
      <li>(so it&#x27;s not going straight back in the bag if it comes out for touchups).</li>
      <li>I like the soft grip handles because you won&#x27;t burn your hands while doing your hair.</li>
      <li>and I really like this flat iron.</li>

    <li> I like it alot. Came on time. Great but wish it was cordless. Smooth, straightens well, and its Great for travel.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it, because while it is small and light, it does a great job</li>
    <li> Love it....compact, heats very quickly, solid feel.....only wish they would make a cordless product</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous flat iron.  Just the right size for quick touch ups and really great if you have short hair.  So happy I could find one.  My last one lasted about 4 years.  I thought I wouldn&#x27;t find anything like my previous Cricket but this one is even better!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd tourmaline Cricket flat iron. Though I love the ease and heat temp of this flat iron, I have found that after a year of use, it stops heating. I thought it may have been a fluke with my first appliance, but it&#x27;s happened again, and I hope to return and see if they can either repair or replace. If not, I&#x27;ll have to choose another brand. Disappointed because I like the size!</li>
    <li> It is a great retouch flat iron and does NOT work as a regular one, even more if you have long hair just like me.&lt;br /&gt;That said, it is great for backpacking, I took it twice and I can barely feel the weight or occupying any space. I also like how fast it gets hot. For its purpose, works great!</li>
    <li> Have only used this once, but it awesome for something on the go to fix your hair. Heats up quick and gets super hot! Great size for on the go!</li>
    <li> This is very small iron. I have to spend 2-3time more of my time to set my hair... regular flat iron doesn&#x27;t take much space anyway, so I thought this doesn&#x27;t worth it for me. I did not return, because I have to pay shipping and restock fee...</li>
    <li> Cute little iron. I bought this at a discount designer store (TJM) and I thought I would try this one. Worst case if I didn&#x27;t like it for my regular iron I could use it for travel. I LOVE the small size. It&#x27;s very small - I&#x27;m guessing no bigger than 8 inches long and my hands can grip it comfortably. The iron itself is only a half inch wide and it does have to do double duty on my very long wavy hair. It doesn&#x27;t have temperature control but it does get really hot. Overall I like this flat iron, I would probably buy it again to use as a supplement to a bigger flat iron. It is nice for touch ups and it is small enough to do the wispy hair close to my ears which I can&#x27;t really get very well with a larger iron. I would recommend for someone who has short hair. If you want your hair to be completely straight and you want your hair straightened in one pass, buy a bigger flat iron because it will take a LONG time with this mini flat iron. I&#x27;m rating this a 4 because of it&#x27;s size.</li>
    <li> Love it super easy to use</li>
    <li> I was looking for a mini iron that had temp control.  Many reviews talked about the temp control so I thought that was what I was getting.  Turns out only the full size version has temp control.  This one does not.  It gets too hot very quickly, so I have to turn it on, quickly start curling then unplug before it gets too hot.  But I use it only for the fringe area of my hair, so it works for me.  But I want to say thanks to Amazon.  The company inadvertently sent a case of 3 instead of the one I ordered and paid for.  I called Amazon and told them.  They sent me a return label for the 2 extra irons.  I was out of State so it was a bit of a hassle to find a UPS place to take the return package, but I did.  In the end, Amazon refunded my purchase price.  I assume this was on purpose, being as the reason for the return was clearly stated on the return label.  That was unexpected and very nice of them.  Always great service from Amazon.</li>
    <li> received merchandise on time, before window given. Flat iron is comparable to one I purchased from my beautician and better price!&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Really like this small flat iron.  I purchased because most days I just have time to do my bangs. I  like to give them a bit of a lift so they are not flat on my forehead.  This is perfect size for that, and a few pieces for face framing. I would of rated 5 stars, but I would like to see an auto shut off, and heat up faster. It does have a nice longer area with rubber so you don&#x27;t burn fingers holding, and I like that the plates go right to the end of metal and the sides have a  small comb like indention that enable you to get close to scalp and slide while slightly turning. I think it gives a more natural look, than trying to achieve with an iron that&#x27;s plates are not quite to the end, and then have a few mm of metal.  It is pretty with a white pearl &amp;#34;ish&amp;#34; finish, with sky blue accents.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a replacement for your full sized flat iron. It&#x27;s convenient to travel with and has a small velcro safety wrap for the cord. I&#x27;d recommend this for touch ups and especially to straighten bangs.</li>
    <li> This item came up in a search for &amp;#34;cordless hair straightener&amp;#34;. I ordered it because I was going on vacation and didn&#x27;t want the hassle of using adapters, but when it arrived, it turns out that it has a cord! It works alright for what it is, but all images on amazon and the packaging for the straightener were completely misleading.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this flat iron would be an ideal gift for my mom. She is starting to regrow her hair and larger flat irons don&#x27;t help her achieve the style she&#x27;s going for on a daily basis. This flat iron worked great for about 6 to 7 weeks or so. Then it started to get extremely hot. She has super fine, coils and waves and does not need as high a heat as my own medium coarse kinky, curly hair. She thought she saw sparks and quit using it. It&#x27;s a shame since she was able to style her hair exactly as she wished with this iron compared to larger, standard flat irons. But, I guess this flat iron wasn&#x27;t designed to be used on a daily or perhaps even a weekly or monthly basis. I&#x27;ll try to find a more solidly built flat iron with variable temperature control.</li>
    <li> Cheaply finished. Design could use some improvement. Allowing cord to rotate would improve handling, adding colors would be a nice option.</li>
    <li> I have really short hair, and just use this on my bangs if they aren&#x27;t behaving. It is the perfect size for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not have variable heat settings, only &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;off.&amp;#34; I have course thick hair and usually want a straightener that gets fairly hot, but this one works perfectly on my bangs. It actually gets quite hot and does the job just fine--I don&#x27;t even have to take 3-4 passes over one are of hair. Just one is fine.</li>
    <li> For such a small straightener it gets the job done. It heats up within seconds of turning it on. My hair is very thick and poofy and while I haven&#x27;t tried straightening my whole head yet, it will straighten my bangs in less than 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this if you need a straightener to neaten up your style for the day. It would be great for travel or even to just keep in your bag or purse it is that small.</li>
    <li> Good size for travel, very sturdy.</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel. Works great on hair just at the shoulder. Just take your time and use small sections. Worth it when needing an over night stay bag or camping and limited on your luggage space.</li>
    <li> Gives my hair a nice finish, and I can make even the shortest section straight or curled as I desire. My only quibble is there is no heat control, it&#x27;s ON or OFF. It runs on the hot side and like any flat iron, can give a nasty burn if you are not careful. But it heats up fast and is easy to hold.</li>
    <li> Straightens as well as my nearly $200 flat iron from Sephora!  I&#x27;m only using this Cricket Mini for touch ups on my ends, and I imagine it might take some time to do your whole head, since it&#x27;s quite tiny -- but boy, would this be great to toss in a handbag for an important night out.  It comes packed in a rectangular box -- not the clear plastic that drugstore flat irons come in -- so you could wrap it pretty easily to give as a gift.  A reusable velcro band keeps the cord wrapped neatly.</li>
    <li> This is a very tiny flat iron - you can easily tuck it into your purse.  It gets very hot and straightens well. My hair is thick, course and curly and I was able to get it straight with this flat iron and was also able to hold at an angle and get a soft curl. I was impressed that it straightened almost as well as my trusted Chi.&lt;br /&gt;For the cons - the reason I did not give it 5 stars: It gets hot, not just the plates but also the outside - you have to be more careful that the outside of it does not hit bare skin.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is perfect for small jobs, short hair and repairs - I&#x27;m glad I bought it and I would recommend it.  I just opened and used, so we will have to wait and see if it is durable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned the product for a while now, and accidentally left it on for 2 days.  It still works find and didn&#x27;t burn my house down.</li>
    <li> Love it, my second one.  Great price.</li>
    <li> When it first arrived, I thought it wouldnt work for me because it is small. But then I tried it. Oh my! It heats up fast, and does a really great job on my fairly short, fine hair. One of the main reasons I bought it is because it said it was friction-free and wouldn&#x27;t pull your hair. For the most part, that is true..if you get your hair in the correct part of the unit it works wonderfully. I use it to curl my hair and make it stay in the position I want it, not to straighten it. I am very pleased with it! All the function of a full sized unit packed into practically a travel size.</li>
    <li> This worked great for helping my get rid of the frizzes in a humid climate. When my hair started to frizz, I just used the mini travel flat iron and it worked great. And it took up almost no room in my suitcase.</li>
    <li> Upon examination, this is clearly not the most well-made device (the plastic seems very cheap and it doesn&#x27;t appear to have an auto-off function), but it&#x27;s the perfect size and shape for flat ironing bangs.  I love that I can get close to my skull and have enough precision to create bangs that follow the curve of my head (instead of bangs that stick straight out).  The plates glide over the hair smoothly without catching.  It packs up small (the cord being the most bulky and annoying thing, taking up more space than the iron itself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats very quickly and very hot.  Because I have only used it to iron my bangs, I can&#x27;t speak to whether it gets too hot or how it does with a full head of hair.  It gets so hot that it takes a while to cool off (so it&#x27;s not going straight back in the bag if it comes out for touchups).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for years and just bought two more. I bring it to my stylist every time for her to use. It&#x27;s great for short hair to give just the right curl too. Every hair stylist that has used it loves it and wants to know where I got it.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how small this thing is. But, it really does work well &amp; straightens my hair great.&lt;br /&gt;I can use it in my car with my power inverter. And yes, it is very smooth gliding over my hair  (no pulling at my hair like&lt;br /&gt;cheap flat irons I&#x27;ve used in the past).</li>
    <li> Very nice&lt;br /&gt;Great price arrived super fast</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I was in need of a ceramic flat iron and this one seemed perfect for my short hair. It is really smooth on my hair and it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair. I really like how small it is.... again I have a short cut so this works perfect for my hair. It doesn&#x27;t take long to get hot. One thing I don&#x27;t like is the fact that you can not control the temperature on the flat iron. But it doesn&#x27;t get too hot for my hair. I like the soft grip handles because you won&#x27;t burn your hands while doing your hair. I also like the color of it. Overall, I am happy I made the purchase and I really like this flat iron.</li>
