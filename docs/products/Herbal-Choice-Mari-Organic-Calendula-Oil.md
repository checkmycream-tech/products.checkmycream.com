<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product.  I have tried EVERYTHING to clear up my dry skin.  I have Seborrheic dermatitis and have had no luck finding something to help including cortizone cream.  This soothed and healed my skin like nothing else i have tried.  It took about a week of consistent use to see improvement, but it has worked.  You only need a little bit or else you will feel greasy.  However, using a small amount makes your skin feel soft and healthy.  I would certainly recommend.</li>
    <li> Really like this product. Have been using Calendula Oil as an additional moisturizer. This product is excellent.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I used it on my hand when I had cancer removed. It was a nasty incision and needed up getting Mrsa. I used this oil on it and it has healed up quite well.</li>
    <li> The main ingredient for this is olive oil, other than that the oil is nice. Seller provided quick delivery</li>
    <li> totally misleading.absplutely no calendula smell.MOST EXPENSIVE OLIVEOIL I EVER BOUGHT. NEVER AGAIN!!!!</li>
    <li> love it. it is not pure essential oil from calendula. This calendula oil is as good as you will find out there for sale.</li>
    <li> Excited to use this oil.</li>
    <li> Warning- this is not extract!!! Diluted!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome! Packaged perfectly!</li>
    <li> This is greatly improving my 2 month olds cradle cap and baby eczema. His skin is almost completely cleared up.</li>
    <li> There is no calendula in this oil. It&#x27;s overpriced Olive Oil.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know this was pre-diluted. It arrived in a larger bottle than I expected, but it&#x27;s mostly olive oil. Not what I expected and I&#x27;m disappointed with the product. There&#x27;s not even a percentage of dilution listed anywhere on the packaging.</li>
    <li> Great oil I use it to make a rub for pain. Will get it again</li>
    <li> Very smooth and soft on the skin.</li>
    <li> Smells and looks like plain olive oil. There is no way of knowing the concentration of calendula in this product. When runs out I&#x27;ll be buying plain calendula extract so I know how much is in the oil I&#x27;m using.&lt;br /&gt;I have two stars instead of one because it comes in a nice dark glass bottle and supposedly its organic which is a good thing.</li>
    <li> I used this during radiation treatment and it was quite nice.  The treatment area was large however so the oil itself was a bit messy but I would recommend for other types of needs.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to use this in a homemade salve for my daughter&#x27;s severe eczema. I was expecting a bottle of calendula oil, but I guess I didn&#x27;t read far enough down in the description to see that it&#x27;s a mix of olive oil and calendula. Upon opening, all I smell is olive oil.Was very disappointed in this purchase.</li>
    <li> Very smooth. I don&#x27;t believe I understand how to best utilize this product to maximize it&#x27;s qualities. I can say it&#x27;s soothing on my skin. This said, I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;ll work on your skin. Everyone is different and responds accordingly.</li>
    <li> Excellent results. Helped clear up radiation redness quickly.</li>
    <li> Very good oil, great smell. I add it to my home-made facial creams together with other ingredients.</li>
    <li> Not even CLOSE to calendula oil.&lt;br /&gt; I got this after I tried out a calendula oil from Whole Foods, loved it, and decided that this was definitely a better buy. I almost felt that this was too good to be true, since I the oil I bought at Whole Foods was more than twice as small, but twice as expensive!&lt;br /&gt;When I got it, it smelled of olive oil and definitely didn&#x27;t feel like the calendula oil I had before. Nonetheless, I gave it a try. The miracles my previous oil did to my skin weren&#x27;t present at all, so it just sits in my bathroom. I&#x27;ll probably throw it out soon.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly &amp; nice high quality oil</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this oil doesn&#x27;t smell like calendula at all. It has a hint of olive oil but no calendula whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I think I will make my own from now on.  Carrier oil used was olive oil and I think I would have preferred sweet almond for a carrier oil instead.</li>
