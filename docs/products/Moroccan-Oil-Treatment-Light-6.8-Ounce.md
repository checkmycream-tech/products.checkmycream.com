<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Makes my hair so soft. Great for light colored hair.</li>
    <li> This product was suggested to me by my new hairdresser (and now the only one I will ever go to).  I literally fly across the country now to go to him.  He was rated top 6 in the world like 10-15 years ago, he&#x27;s been in the industry a long time.  He also chemically formulated his bleach so that he doesn&#x27;t have to wear gloves! BTW he has a college degree in like engineering or something, this is just what he loves doing.  He is the one who suggested this product.  It is NOT going to make the inside of your hair stronger (the shaft or something).  This is purely for cosmetic reasons.  I straighten my hair every day and the tips get fried.  I started using this every other day (on the off days I use the product he suggested to make the actual hair shaft stronger and protects against heat), and it has really made my hair softer and shinier!  Its a bit pricy but you don&#x27;t need to use much.  Also, only put it on the lower half of your hair (ie not at the roots).  Hope this helps :).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan....what else can I say??  This has made my hair so soft and so much more manageable.  I&#x27;m so glad I found it and it doesn&#x27;t break the bank to get it.</li>
    <li> I received the oil..with the pump..the pump is too big for the bottle..worthless, won&#x27;t order from them again.</li>
    <li> Moroccanoil is a product I can not live without in my hair products drawer. Not only has this saved my hair on numerous occasions it keeps my hair lush and beautiful soft when already healthy. This is one of the first products I would suggest to someone who is looking for a great hair product! LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this oil, really helps keep hair moisturised.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product form ABOVE ALL BEAUTY.  The picture on the Internet did not show that it was  \\&quot;light\\&quot;, for fine and light colored hair, (which is the opposite of mine).  Above All Beauty would not exchange it on my initial request, so I resigned myself to having to use the wrong type and opened package. A week later they contacted me and told me to send the unopened package back for an exchange, which I couldn&#x27;t do at this point as I had opened it. I use the product, but it is not near as effective for the type of hair I have. You would have thought Above All Beauty would have accepted the opened package or just sent me a new regular bottle (even the smaller one)in good faith. Be careful what you order from this company..good prices...customer service...not so much!!!</li>
    <li> I am very hard on my hair and have tried every product under the sun but none compare to this! Love it! This is my go to every day use!</li>
    <li> I have been using Moroccan Oil for years and did not know I could purchase the product for light hair.  I also was not aware I could get 6.8 ounces for just a little more money than I was paying for the 3.4 ounce bottle sold by the salon.  I will order again at this price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and will never use anything else.  Creates shine and smoothness, fights frizzies.  Works best for me if I apply it to the longer parts of my hair, and not at the scalp.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Item is as described.  Fast and secure shipping.</li>
    <li> This oil leaves my hair soft with no frizz &amp; gets tangles out so easily . Love it :) highly recommend .</li>
    <li> My 2nd bottle. I love this serum and this brand. My hair usually get&#x27;s really tangled by the end of the day, but this stuff keeps my my hair smoother longer in btwn washes. I also really love BioSilk, but I think Moroccan Oil smells a lot better. My bf loves the smell of this stuff.</li>
    <li> This product really makes my hair easy to work with- it is normally thin and fly away.  Just a little bit makes a difference, so one bottle will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Love this product. My hair is fine/relaxed and color treated, but I have lots of it, so the &#x27;light&#x27; formula doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there was no pump included like in the picture... which is a pain especially for a bottle this size. Fortunately I was able to use the pump from previous my 4.3oz bottle. It&#x27;s just a little short though.</li>
    <li> Great price for an AWSOME product</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to argon oil on a trip to Morocco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s makes your hair lusterous .  I put it on my face before applying face cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rub it all over my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not oily and absorbers instantly into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.  I would never be without a backup!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linda M</li>
    <li> dries hair so quickly and restores damage!</li>
    <li> worth every penny. i love this oil on my hair with no alchol.</li>
    <li> Perfect product just as expected!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!! My friend uses a different brand -Argan oil and Moroccan oil is superior I think.  I have used both.  I also like the smell of this brand better.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair treatment</li>
    <li> Great product. I love the fragrance and it does not leave residue on your hair. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> When you live in a very dry climate, Moroccan Oil Treatment is a must for your hair.  I have used it for several years and it makes such a difference.  I would recommend for anyone with dry hair or living in a dry climate.</li>
    <li> Love the softness and bounce in my hair,  My hair was damaged from curling irons and blow drying, so far I have only used it for a few weeks now so hopefully the results will be awesome as I continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This oil makes my hair wonderful...I apply while my hair is wet then proceed too blow dry. No frizzies and great looking hair not to mention wonderful fragrance</li>
    <li> Came as expected - I have blonde hair and I moved from using mousse to using this. Glad I made the switch! My hair is healthier, doesn&#x27;t dry out from all the chemicals in mousse and the light oil doesn&#x27;t darken my light hair. I have perfect curls always now!</li>
    <li> Great value, perfect product</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 7 years and absolutely love it. I have tried other argan oils and they do not work as well as Moroccan Oil Treatment. This price was very reasonable. The package arrived fast and in perfect condition. Will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for the hair</li>
    <li> Have used this treatment oil for a long time now and just discovered it on Amazon, so know the price is better! Thanks,</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  Unfortunately whenever I have ordered it online; it comes to my house leaking out of the carton.</li>
    <li> Great product!!!  Extremely happy!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve being using Moroccan oil for a while now and love it. Use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair too. Leaves the hair soft shiny and helps with the knots without leaving the hair feeling greasy. Did not have any problems with shipping.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think it was possible to love the &amp;#34;Light&amp;#34; version more than the &amp;#34;Original.&amp;#34; I have dry, coarse, ethnic hair and this product is the perfect quench. Not oily or greasy and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. I apply it every night before going to bed with a silk wrap/bonnet to hold in the moisture overnight. In the morning my hair is very soft, manageable, tangle-free and easy to style</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite hair care products!  Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling or looking greasy!  Can&#x27;t do without it!</li>
    <li> This is the most wonderful hair product ever!  I would recommend to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day and when I plan to straighten my hair!</li>
    <li> This is a great hair product.  Expense, but worth the money.  Keeps hair moist and prevents splitting and fraying.  Very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> This is miraculous!!!  A  little bit of this oil goes a LONG way and prevents split ends from happening.  The \\&quot;light\\&quot; is for fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE this oil..&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve started using this oil, my hairdresser of 33 years is amazing with my hair each time I go in.  My hair is the longest (and healthiest) it has ever been.  (long from this product, and healthy from proper nutrition- best combination)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t read the description well enough and got the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; version instead of the original.  Kind of a bummer, but it works fine.  However I prefer the not so light version.</li>
    <li> I have been using Moroccanoil for about 3 years.  I am a natural blonde with fine to medium hair, to approximatly the middle of my back.  I use a blow dryer and curling iron or flat iron everyday.  This protects my hair from the heat and makes it so soft and shiney.  A little product goes a long way.  I only use one small pump (less than a dime size) for each use.  Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair soft, smooth, untangled and manageable. A little goes a long way, my hair falls slightly below my shoulders and I use 2 pumps. It also helps my hair dry faster, which means I spend less time blowdrying it.</li>
    <li> love this oil. light and controls frizzies</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing! I cannot live without it. I use it right after I get out of the shower and then wrap my hair back up in my towel while I put my face and body moisturizer on. It helps with tangles and leaves my hair so soft and shiny, many people have commented on my hair.</li>
    <li> Great buy &amp; fast shipper. Thanks</li>
    <li> Nothing better. I have bleached blonde hair and no split ends. Right out of shower and before brushing my wert hair I use two pumps on my hair and the brush glides easily. And I have way too much hair and my original color is dark brown so... This bottle is a miracle bottle!!</li>
    <li> Great for dried out hair.  I color my hair often and that tends to make it dry.  This product is gives it a wonderful shine and makes my hair feel soft.</li>
    <li> I love this product and would recommend it to anyone!  It makes my hair very soft and shiny!!!  Well worth purchasing...</li>
    <li> Softens beautifully. Great product</li>
    <li> This oil is the best you can buy!</li>
    <li> Did not yet use&lt;br /&gt;But ships are satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Want to buy again, try using permitting&lt;br /&gt;price seems expensive.&lt;br /&gt;But is satisfied in buying</li>
    <li> Ordered this through Amazon and truly loved it, and the service. I have used Moroccan oil products for many years and would not hesitate to recommend to any potential user.</li>
    <li> I received the Morroccan Oil faster than I expected.  The botttle did leak a tiny bit but it wasn&#x27;t enough to be upset about.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff for my color treated fine hair. I only have to use one pump worth of oil for all my hair after I wash it (I have shoulder length hair).</li>
    <li> I have extremely curly hair that has been chemically straightened and this is all I need to blow out nice frizz free hair that is soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I have used this stuff for about 5 years now. I love using the light version because my hair gets oily fast, but also needs moisture. It works great makes your hair soft absorbs right away and doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy. I use it every day after I shower</li>
    <li> The smell is incredible! Works great</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t put any other oil, gel, mousse or cream in my hair. Moroccan oil is to blondes as cookies are with milk. Meant to be! Not only does it help tame frizz and look great but it&#x27;s actually really good for your hair and protects it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Not as heavy as original, but really makes hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> This product is well worth the price. I have thyroid disease which can leave your hair brittle and damaged. After shampooing I put a small amount on hands and massage into hair before combing. Over time my hair has gotten healthier with no split ends!!!!!! My hair is also very thin, but this oil gets completely absorbed, leaving behind no gunk to weigh it down or make it look greasy.</li>
