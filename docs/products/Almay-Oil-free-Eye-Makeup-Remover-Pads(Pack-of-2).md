      <li>I love that I can get these on subscription now</li>
      <li>This is my favorite eye makeup remover.  </li>
      <li>I have used these eye makeup remover pads for years, and my favorite part about them is that you can take off your makeup with them, and immediately reapply without it getting smeary.</li>
      <li>Love all Almay  products.</li>
      <li>This is the best make up remover that I have used in recent years.  </li>
      <li>I love these pads-</li>
      <li>reviewers have commented that it took too many of the Almay pads to thoroughly remove their eye makeup.  </li>
      <li>But I ALSO agree that I seem now to need to use more than one pad per eye, and that even after using them at night I sometimes still wake up with mascara under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>I would love to have a product that would remove the eye make-up with just a couple of pads.</li>
      <li>I have tried many times to have Amazon correct this but to no avail.  </li>
      <li>and you have to use more than one to fully remove make-up.  </li>
      <li>They take off the even the most severe mascaras and eyeliners, which I have found to be Dior and Mary Kay, in that order.  </li>
      <li>I make sure mine are &amp;#34;damp&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite eye makeup remover.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s nice to find them in a special package with Bonus extra quantity at a great price!</li>
      <li>A great product, but unfortunately no longer available in Australia</li>
      <li>They are oil free and do a great job of removing eye makeup without too much rubbing or stinging.  </li>

      <li>The are stored easily away in the cabinet in the compact container.</li>
      <li>but when I do I like to be over to take it off easily.</li>
      <li>I think they clean better than the oil-free.</li>
      <li>Great to have that extra amount, and being able to buy a 2-pack</li>
      <li>A very good, simple way to clean off eye makeup.  </li>
      <li>However, if oil is a problem for anyone, these are fine.</li>
      <li>It is a huge time saver too</li>
      <li>I also like that it is oil free.</li>
      <li>I had to use Neutrogena Oil Free Make Up Remover (bottle) to get it off.</li>
      <li>I accidentally ordered the oil free type after using the moisturizing ones for years.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear a ton of eye-makeup -- just mascara and light shadow.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Favorite eye makeup remover, so convenient to have it shipped</li>
    <li> The makeup remover pads were relatively dry compared to the container I have bought at the local store. I even leave it upside down!</li>
    <li> These were very small and did not remove make up well. The pads must be old as they were almost dry. I should have returned but not worth the return postage. I will not buy this product or use this company again.</li>
    <li> These pads remove even super waterproof mascara without tugging or stretching skin. My eye skin is super sensitive and these pads do not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I only wear eye a small amount of makeup, and one pad per eye takes it off just fine. I would imagine if you wear a lot of makeup / heavy mascara you would have to use a couple pads per eye.</li>
    <li> Although I love these makeup pads and I use them daily, I find that the top and bottom ones are dried out so I end up throwing out so so many in each container !!! ;(</li>
    <li> When I bought this pads at the store, one of them is more than enough to remove even waterproof mascara from both eyes. The ones that were bought thru Amazon does not work, I need 4-5 and still don&#x27;t get the regular mascara off. Something happened, the product was damaged.</li>
    <li> These work ok for me.  I just don&#x27;t like the smell of them, it isn&#x27;t pleasant.  I do like that they aren&#x27;t greasy.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter.I do not wear make up so this is the first time using any product like this, but she says it works wonderful!and I do not notice the \\&quot;raccoon\\&quot; eyes like before so I am also very pleased with this. I will be buying these again!</li>
    <li> I have used these exclusively for 15 years. They work super good. Easy to use, no mess. If it takes you a long time to get through a jar of them, they may get a bit dry - just add a titch of water to the jar. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I got these from Target as a sample one day and have never changed since then. They are perfect for removing eye make up of all kinds. They don&#x27;t leave my eyes feeling greasy and are just refreshing. I love that I can get these on subscription now, I never have to think about buying them again. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have used these before and tried other products and keep coming back to these, they do not irritate my eyes and do a great job of removing eye makeup, non drying as well.  I just think they are a little high priced for what you get</li>
    <li> IT CAUSED ME ALLERGIES</li>
    <li> I love it!  I&#x27;ve used them for years and don&#x27;t plan on stopping any time soon!</li>
    <li> Almay oily eye make up remover always makes it hard for me to see after using it.  This Oil-free eye makeup remover pads is the best of both worlds.  It removes the makeup with out any harsh side effects.</li>
    <li> I discovered Almay Eye Makeup Remover from a friend when I had run out of my own. I have oily skin so I needed an oil-free remover and this works wonders for me. Though it is marketed for removing eye makeup it actually does not completely remove my mascara, but it is light, oil-free, and moisturizing at the same time for my skin when removing foundation.</li>
    <li> I used three of these per eye to remove the new Dior plumping mascara (not waterproof.) Still had racoon eyes after.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years, it is a great product.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eye makeup remover.  The pads are the perfect size and the moisture level is perfect.  I use one every night before I wash my face.  I wear contacts and they don&#x27;t bother my contacts at all.  I&#x27;ve used these for at least 10 years and I will continue to use them for many years to come.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to certain eye makeup removal products This however gives me no adverse reactions. I also like that it is oil free.</li>
    <li> not expensive ...... it made me worry that it would be junk, and this is cheap and it works great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after several weeks of daily use, my eyes started to mat up through the night until one morning they were matted closed. I stopped using them and my eyes went back to normal, I was surprised.</li>
    <li> A lot of beauty products are called must haves... I consider it as must have if I have bought it again and again and also have to have a back up jar! This product is great, works well, and does not bother my eyes or contacts. I have bought maybe 20 of these over the past 10 years I have been using them.</li>
    <li> I love these!  Have been using them for years.  They are the most effective eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I wear contact lenses and this is incredibly gentle and effective, the best eye makeup removal product I have ever used.  Convenient to use as well.&lt;br /&gt;Wet your lids and lashes by gently tapping and let it have a few seconds to soften your eye makeup before softly scrubbing your lids.  This works well for waterproof mascara.  Use one side of the pad for each eye and you will need only one pad for daytime eye makeup removal.  Your night/club makeup may need two pads, depending on how much eye makeup you are trying to remove and if you have glitter, eyelash glue, etc that you are trying to get off.</li>
    <li> This eye make-up remover works great; pads are lint-free which makes it even better.  No oily residue to blur your vision when finished.</li>
    <li> have used this for years get it and give it as gifts. clean and does a good job if removing eye make up evan water proof mascara</li>
    <li> A very good, simple way to clean off eye makeup.  My only concern is that although they&#x27;re supposed to be non-allergenic, I do find that they affect my eyes a little and I must use eye drops to clear that up.</li>
    <li> Almay Oil-Free Eye Makeup Remover Pads is all I use.  It&#x27;s nice to find them in a special package with Bonus extra quantity at a great price!</li>
    <li> The product works, but each &amp;#34;pad&amp;#34; is very small in diameter (just a bit bigger than a quarter) and thin.  I usually use a stack of about 10 per eye.&lt;br /&gt;The pads do remove my eye makeup but I don&#x27;t wear very much.  I can&#x27;t imagine someone who uses heavy eye makeup would like them very much.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> A great product, but unfortunately no longer available in Australia</li>
    <li> My daughter recommended this to me, and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it. Works so gently, doesn&#x27;t sting, and really cleans off the eye makeup! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I am loyal fan of this product. It arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> works well, not oily.</li>
    <li> These were the perfect size and cheaper than in Walmart, CVS, etc. I use these every day and don&#x27;t know how I would get my eye-makeup off without it!</li>
    <li> I have used these eye makeup remover pads for years, and my favorite part about them is that you can take off your makeup with them, and immediately reapply without it getting smeary.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eye make-up remover and the only one I&#x27;ve used for years.  Fast, easy, no oily residue.  And the case is really great for travel.</li>
    <li> The best eye makeup remover I have ever used. I first tried these about 1 1/2 years ago and still use the brand every day. These makeup remover pads quickly and easily clean off the day&#x27;s eye shadow, eye liner and mascara. No more leftover flakes in my eyes at night! I love that the pads are so thin yet still do the trick. I used to use bottled makeup remover with cotton pads -- what a waste!</li>
    <li> They are oil free and do a great job of removing eye makeup without too much rubbing or stinging.  This package has more than the standard number of pads (in the regular size jar).  Great to have that extra amount, and being able to buy a 2-pack makes it a very economical purchase.</li>
    <li> I have tried the knock-off version of these eye makeup remover pads but the pads are not as soft.  These are very gentle on the under-eye area and still take off waterproof makeup despite being oil free.  I have been using daily for years and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> These work well, but I&#x27;ve found that I prefer the originals, that are not oil-free. I think they clean better than the oil-free. However, if oil is a problem for anyone, these are fine.</li>
    <li> Very gentle cleanser. I love that it contains no oil. I have dry eye issues and oil exacerbates the problem. My only criticism is....&lt;br /&gt;even with thorough rinsing, in the morning I have residue (mascara) under my eyes. I cannot quite rinse off all the remover.&lt;br /&gt;But, that may just be me :-)</li>
    <li> These are awful. Total waste of money. They are tiny and super thin. When I try to take one out of the container my fingers grab at least 3. One eye requires several pads and I wear minimal eye shadow and mascara. Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Neutrogena large extra gentle eye makeup removal pads are FAR BETTER!!! They are large and thick. They are more money but you will use far less of them so in the end it probably ends up being the same!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Makeup-Remover-Large-Gentle/dp/B001ET7GV2/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1354040783&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;neutrogena+eye+makeup+remover+pads</li>
    <li> These are my favorite eye makeup remover pads! I&#x27;m not sure what the negative reviews are talking about when they say they need multiple pads just to remove their makeup. How much makeup are these people wearing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reuse the same pad for 3-4 nights in a row and it easily removes all of my eye shadow, eye liner, and mascara. Granted, I don&#x27;t wear facial makeup such as foundation, which may be where these other people are having an issue...?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these pads for years. I have extremely sensitive skin and very sensitive eyes and am a contact lens wearer.  I can only use one brand of saline solution, Sensitive Eyes, because my eyes are so prone to allergic reactions.  Same with my skin. I only use La Mer, Oil of Olay and Almay moisturizers.  Sometimes they can be a little &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;. You need to wring them out.  Don&#x27;t use them sopping wet or yes you will have an issue.  I make sure mine are &amp;#34;damp&amp;#34;.  They take off the even the most severe mascaras and eyeliners, which I have found to be Dior and Mary Kay, in that order.  Only use the &amp;#34;oil free&amp;#34; version.  The other one is extremely greasy.</li>
    <li> I accidentally ordered the oil free type after using the moisturizing ones for years. This type takes about 3 pads per eye to try to get waterproof mascara off. I only use one pad for both eyes using the other type. Will uses these up and get my usual ( and much more effective) type. I wash my face using facial cleanser after taking mascara off, so no issue with residue or stinging eyes as others have reported.</li>
    <li> In the past, I have used Almay Oil-Free Eye Makeup Remover Liquid without any problems.  I purchased and received two packs of 120-count remover pads and have used them for the last two nights.  I don&#x27;t mind that they are thin and you have to use more than one to fully remove make-up.  However, since the time I used the remover liquid, Almay has added a new ingredient which now highly irritates my skin (which is otherwise normal and with which I have never had any issues).  I have developed dry, flaky patches that are painful and uncomfortable where I used the remover pads.  I will never use the remainder of this product nor will I recommend it to anyone else.  Spend your money elsewhere.</li>
    <li> These are a good buy.  I had been buying makeup removing wipes which are like 6.99-7.99 for 24/25.  They are much larger and are for your whole face, but I only really needed them for my eyes.  For my needs, even using 1 for each eye.. these give you way more for a much lower cost.  The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is that they were smaller than I originally expected.</li>
    <li> These remover pads work well and get off the old mascara, eyeliner, shadow, etc. You have to use quite a few of them to remove all of your eye make-up if you use several products on your eyes. I would love to have a product that would remove the eye make-up with just a couple of pads. These pads are good but before my eyes are clean, I have to use five or six of them. That&#x27;s my only complaint. They don&#x27;t irritate the eyes.</li>
    <li> I wear makeup every day. Shadow, liner, waterproof mascara (Bobbi Brown). I use one pad for both eyes before washing my face, and it removes every trace of eye makeup. The area around my eyes feel clean and soft. What are you other chicas wearing on your eyes? Tar? Great product!</li>
    <li> Works well for Blatheritis (sp?), too!</li>
    <li> Love all Almay  products. They always do exactly what they&#x27;re advertised to do. Great value on these make up remover pads and they last a long time.</li>
    <li> These things are great! So nice not to have to pull out a cotton ball and distribute eye makeup remover all over. This saves that step. Plus I&#x27;m certain it costs less per use than other eye makeup removers.</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I expected. Some eye irritation with this product.  Perhaps oil would take off eye makeup easier.  Eyeliner and mascara are difficult to remove with these pads.  You have to use several per eye to get the job done.</li>
    <li> These were purchased for my Granddaughter.  She loves them!!</li>
    <li> I use these daily, and the large size is a nice bonus.  I also use the small travel container and refill it from these.  Great value.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, very gentle.</li>
    <li> Best eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve tried. It completely removes eye makeup without feeling the least bit oily. Price is good too.</li>
    <li> I wold prefer if the pad were a bit larger. I usually have to use 2 pads for each eye to get all the mascara off</li>
    <li> Been using this for years.</li>
    <li> Love this product, but so overpriced!!</li>
    <li> Good product--cleans well with no stinging or irritation, wipes off well enough with clean water that I can put mascara on right away without worrying about it smearing.</li>
    <li> My favorite eye make-up remover pads for the past 8 years.  Don&#x27;t dry out my sensitive skin, nor do they leave a greasy residue like many other make-up removers.  love them!</li>
    <li> Gentle and thorough.  Can&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
    <li> I love the convenience of having these makeup remover pads. No more making sure I have cotton balls on hand in addition to make up remover solution. It is convenient to use and my eye make up is gone after a couple of swipes.</li>
    <li> I use this daily to remove my mascara and am happy with the product. Removes my mascara gently and it&#x27;s convenient.</li>
    <li> Have used Almay makeup remover pads for years. Much easier than using a liquid remover with cotton ball. Still have to have a backup for eye liner that is very close to the eye. These have never caused any sensitivity issues, or irritated my eyes.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as expected.  I have used these for years and they are the only eye makeup remover pads that do not irritate my eyes.</li>
    <li> very convenient and they work well, not greasy</li>
    <li> Just the right size. I use one side for one eye and the other side for the other eye. Very simple, works well and does not irritate my sensitive skin. On Amazon is a very good value. Cheaper than Walmart.</li>
    <li> Ive been using these for years. This is the only brand that does not leave the skin around my eyes burning. The wipes are very gentle, they dont need any scrubbing to remove makeup, and they work very very well. They remove all eye makeup with just one swipe.</li>
    <li> This product is consistent with the quality that one expects from Almay products.  The price is right and the results are amazing!</li>
    <li> I love these pads- I use one for each eye at night to take my mascara and eyeshadow off and it wipes off so easily! It is a huge time saver too</li>
    <li> No irritation even though I wear contact lenses.  No oil is also a plus. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> The best...Almay Oil-free Eye Makeup Remover Pads, 120-Count (Pack of 2)...nothing works better to remove mascara. I will use nothing else.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of Makeup Remover Pads, but these are fantastic!!!!!!  Makeup came off easy and fast with no residue or oil. I thought the mascara would take forever to get off but it took it right off.  I love these and will definitely order again!!!!</li>
    <li> I typically buy this at the store. This was a deal I couldn&#x27;t pass up. I highly recommend this remover to everyone. It is so gentle and easy to use :)</li>
    <li> No messy creams and lotions here. In a compact container with thin treated pads ready to use. The best for me and none allergic for my skin.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eye makeup remover. Not oily and it gets the job done well. Also great for traveling.</li>
    <li> I use these every night to wipe my eye makeup off - so glad i can get them on amazon!</li>
    <li> These makeup remover pads work well in that they are able to completely remove eye makeup (including smudge proof eyeliners and mascaras that recommend oil-based removers). However, these caused me to experience severe irritation of the skin around my eyes - red, flaky, patchy, dry, painful, unsightly skin right around the eyelid about where eyeliner goes.  Note that I do NOT have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially blamed a new eye cream I was using and it took me some time to realize that these were causing my irritation since I assumed Almay meant what it said about supposedly gentle, hypoallergenic products. As soon as I discontinued use of these pads (but kept using the falsely accused eye cream!) my irritation began to go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really too bad because these pads really do remove eye makeup extremely well and the pre-soaked pad format is super convenient. Try at your own risk.</li>
    <li> These cleansing pads work well with all kinds of makeup, including my waterproof mascara.  No oil, no smell, no residue.  Doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.  Does a great job for me!</li>
    <li> These things are fantastic, especially if you travel (or go to the gym).  They&#x27;re small, they work, and they don&#x27;t sting your eyes or overdry your skin.</li>
    <li> Would have given it 5 stars but the container was really small. I expected it to be bigger.</li>
    <li> is it too much to expect an eye make-up remover to be sensitive on the eyes? i can&#x27;t get through the removal of my mascara without my eyes burning.</li>
    <li> I am hooked on these...convenient, gentle, and affordable.  I wear contacts and there is no oily residue or film after using this product.</li>
    <li> These work great. I don&#x27;t have to rub and no grease!  Love, love, love them!</li>
    <li> I like these pads.  Cleans eye make&#x3D;up easily, no fuss no muss.  The are stored easily away in the cabinet in the compact container.</li>
    <li> I used to love Almay eye makeup remover pads and they were the only thing I would use, but it seems they have changed their product.  The pads are now really flimsy and not saturated with cleanser.  I used to be able to take off all of my eye makeup with one pad, and now it takes two or three to get the job done.</li>
    <li> These work really well. NO smell and there are a lot of them in one container.</li>
    <li> My eyes sting! I bought these because I have really sensitive skin. When I wear make up I use Almay&#x27;s mascara and eyeliner but these pads do not even efficiently remove their own brand make up products, you&#x27;ll have to scrub your eyelids several times and you&#x27;ll still end with raccoon eyes.</li>
    <li> Very large jar and low priced.  Works really well and in a pinch, it comes in real handy for a shiny nose.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  It is the best eye makeup remover ever.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to wear make up very often but when I do I like to be over to take it off easily. These oil free pads are the perfect solution for me.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I ended up tossing them in the rubbish as I felt it would do more harm than good for my skin and eyes. I have a feeling that Almay may have discontinued this product and this is being sold until it runs out. I&#x27;ll not ever buy this gain. I do like Almay products, I use some of them, but this one is not fit for me at least.</li>
    <li> This product sucks! The pads are so small that you have to use more than 3 or 4 just to get the makeup off one eye (good luck with the mascara) and by the time you&#x27;re done finally getting all the makeup off your eyes feel like they&#x27;ve had soap rubbed in them, OUCH! For an EYE makeup remover you&#x27;d think they&#x27;d be more gentle but they&#x27;re not, they&#x27;re just a waste of money. It really surprised me how much these made my eyes sting, and I do not have sensitive eyes in the least. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these wipes to anyone!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear a ton of eye-makeup -- just mascara and light shadow. One of these pre-moistened pads removes all the makeup from both eyes, and washing my face takes care of everything else. I haven&#x27;t experienced any discomfort or stinging with this product. The fabric of the pads seem to be gentle on my skin and the solution doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. I appreciate the convenience and price of this two-pack, and I plan to re-order in the future.</li>
    <li> These are much too small.  You end up using at least one pad, maybe more, on each eye.  Not good value at all.  Try Marcelle&#x27;s Eye Make-up Removing cloths.  I have been using the Marcelle&#x27;s for several year, and am very happy with them.  Occasionally I will try something different, but always got back.</li>
    <li> The best product of its type. I don&#x27;t know what I would do without them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been alternating between these and the liquid version of Almay makeup remover for years. Either they changed the formula or my eyes got sensitive (which is a possibility - I did have an eye infection 2 years ago). So I just finished up a pack of the pads last night and tonight I started the liquid. Both sting like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. The pads require 2-3 per eye for medium to heavy makeup but they are really handy and still quite useful. I like that they are really thin. I don&#x27;t like the sting. It seems I&#x27;m not the only one, so I&#x27;m not going to chalk it up to an eye infection that got cleared 2 years ago. My optometrist has since cleared me for contact use, and has seen me on more than one occasion with no indication of a problem, so as far as I know, I don&#x27;t have any other factors contributing to irritation that would cause such a painful burn every time I use this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it works well, and for a number of years it was my favourite. But now I&#x27;ll be on the lookout for a new brand.</li>
    <li> Good product but the misleading content amount.  When I purchased this through Amazon they indicated I would receive (2) 120-Count containers. Only one was shipped. I have tried many times to have Amazon correct this but to no avail.  None of the online tools allow for &#x27;missing&#x27; item in the package.</li>
    <li> Love the product, and used it for about 8 years now, but used to be able to get it so much cheaper. It is the only makeup remover I buy now.</li>
    <li> When I ordered these I was hoping for something durable. Unfortunately, these wipes are very small and very thin. I don&#x27;t wear that much make up, and it took 3 wipes per eye. Which means I&#x27;ll be using 6 wipes per day, and out of 240 wipes (between the 2 packages) that only leaves me 40 days. I could&#x27;ve just bought a package of 30 wipes from target for $5. On the other hand, these wipes do not burn my eyes which most wipes usually do. And if you use enough wipes, they actually get all the makeup off. I just wish they were a little bit thicker because theyre almost paper thin.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this product. I use regular mascara and this product didn&#x27;t take it completely off. I had to use Neutrogena Oil Free Make Up Remover (bottle) to get it off. I was wanting to use pads for the convenience but what&#x27;s the point if you have to use another product to complete the job.</li>
    <li> Best eye makeup remover!</li>
    <li> These wipes really do the job of removing my eye makeup (the reason I gave this three stars) but just minutes after wiping my makeup off, I have to flush my eyes out with cold water because my eyes start burning like crazy. I really wanted to like these because they did not make my eyes feel oily afterwards like my Neutrogena wipes do. Alas, I will take oily over burning any day. I will sadly be returning back to the Neutrogena wipes. :( Curse my sensitive skin and allergies!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of eye makeup removers over the years:  some that were liquids to be applied to cotton pads; and some, such as these by Almay, that are pads that have already been pre-saturated with cleansing remover.  The convenience of the pre-soaked pads is definitely preferable to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I avoid using makeup remover pads with any oil in them because the oil leaves a residue that bothers my eyes.  However, there are also some oil-free pads that contain ingredients that cause eye sensitivity for me, too.  After years of trying many different options, for the past several years I&#x27;ve chosen to stay with these Oil-Free Almay pads.  A few months ago, while out of the country, I ran out and ended up purchasing what I thought was a very similar product.  The container looked about the same, the pads were the same size/shape, and I understood just enough of the French labeling to know that they were oil-free.  Not the same, though.  My eyes burned from some other ingredient that was apparently in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have commented that it took too many of the Almay pads to thoroughly remove their eye makeup.  That hasn&#x27;t been my experience; but it may be because I don&#x27;t wear very heavy makeup...just mascara and a little bit of liner/shadow.  One pad per eye has always been sufficient for me to fully cleanse my entire eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip, especially if you buy one of the larger (taller) containers of pads -- If the pads on the top of the newly opened container don&#x27;t seem damp enough, it may just be that they&#x27;ve been on the shelf for awhile.  Just store the container upside down overnight.  Otherwise, the pads on the very bottom can be pretty wet and drippy by the time you work down to them.</li>
    <li> After trying very different brands, I found this product. Excellent for my allergies, doesn&#x27;t cause me any allergies , it is great</li>
    <li> If you purchase these pads be prepared to use several per eye (each night) and STILL wake up with black under your eyes.  If you&#x27;re looking for effective eye makeup remover, look elsewhere - I will be!</li>
    <li> I recently ordered my second 2-pack of this product.  I liked these pads very much the first time I ordered them, but agree with a recent reviewer who said there doesn&#x27;t seem to be as much of the makeup remover solution on the pads as there used to be (if you order them anyway, I recommend removing the entire stack of pads and turning it over in the container, rotating the dryer pads to the bottom and bringing the most-saturated pads to the top).  I agree that they&#x27;re useful for travel (not liquid &#x3D; no restrictions on airplanes), and that they don&#x27;t sting your eyes (good perks).  But I ALSO agree that I seem now to need to use more than one pad per eye, and that even after using them at night I sometimes still wake up with mascara under my eyes.  I&#x27;ll use the ones I have, but think I&#x27;ll look for something better next time.</li>
    <li> This is the best make up remover that I have used in recent years.  Very gentle on my eyes and eye lids.</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife and she loves it! So i bought for my mom and sister as well and they all agree that it works really well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before so I knew what I was getting and wanted.  The plus at this time was the phenomenal price.  This will be my new source.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these makeup remover pads since I can remember, and I like them a lot. It can get expensive buying them at CVS, so the Amazon 2-pack seemed like a good deal. The only thing I would caution with the 120-count containers is that the pads on the top are often dry - it seems that Almay doesn&#x27;t add enough makeup remover liquid to saturate all of the pads. So sometimes the first several pads are useless. I&#x27;ve tried storing the container upside down, which kind of helps. Either way, I think it&#x27;s still a better deal than buying the regular size container, which has 90 or 100 pads.</li>
    <li> I used to like these, but it seems that there is less of the removing agent on the pads lately. It takes several pads and a long concerted effort to get mascara completely off. (And I&#x27;m not talking about waterproof mascara.) Going to look to another brand for eye makeup remover.</li>
