      <li>in my house say that this razor is lightweight and that it feels very nice to hold - it fits his hand perfectly.  </li>

      <li>Well it does, and it works great.</li>
      <li>Great shaver for the value.</li>
      <li>I also noticed a great number of pinches, presumably hairs being pulled out.</li>
      <li>and it did a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>how great it shaved.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It works great both in and out of the shower.</li>

      <li>This does a great job.  </li>
      <li>It is great that it is cordless and can be used in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>i would recommend for anyone that doesn&#x27;t want to spend alot for a great shaver</li>
      <li>works great and as listed.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend says it works great for his face.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t a great shaver, but works fairly well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Somewhat surprisingly, the instructions recommend using this product in the shower, with shaving cream.</li>
      <li>The shaver is fairly lightweight.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall the  Remington XR1330 is a good shaver for the money.</li>
      <li>Its smooth and works perfectly.</li>

      <li>This one does a good job.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Verdict: Uncertain, but concerned that the shave isn&#x27;t all that good for</li>
      <li>t cut as good as my shaver</li>
      <li>shaver itself provides a clean, close shave, but it works best with shaving cream as it tends to stick rather than glide across the face without it.</li>
      <li>They must be very sure that this gives a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really liked how it fit in my hand and the unit flexed perfectly going around the corners of my jaw and neck line.  </li>
      <li>On my first use, it tore through a 3-day growth of beard faster than the best Norelco I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
      <li>This is my first time using a rotary shaver, and I was impressed.  </li>
      <li>The XR1330 is pretty quite for a rotary shaver and the vibration in the hand and on the face is perfectly acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>reason why I say so, is that this razor has a great feel, and has a really a comfortable shaving surface.  </li>
      <li>Nice close cut.</li>
      <li>Good price compared to many others.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a blade kind of guy.  </li>
      <li>rotary shavers go, this one has a nice ergonomic design that fits well in my hand.</li>
      <li>The charging station is nice and simple.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My husband gives this electric shaver an enthusiastic two thumbs up.</li>
      <li>and he says it&#x27;s nice to have for days</li>
      <li>My own preference would have been to have a heavier shaver</li>
      <li>That allows me to effectively guide the shaver as I shape my beard.</li>
      <li>It pivots generously and looks as if it will conform nicely to the contours of your face.  </li>
      <li>We both think it looks nice, but like I said, we&#x27;ve never owned a shaver before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The handle is surprisingly ergonomic and easy to grip.</li>
      <li>Sure, I&#x27;ve tried and own a number of razors including a never Panasonic foil wet/dry shaver and a Norelco Rotary Electric Razor, but I don&#x27;t use them because they can&#x27;t shave as close as a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Both are impressive in initial quality:  out of the box, they&#x27;re the best Remington shavers, BY FAR, that I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>I found that the shave was OK for when I&#x27;m on the run.</li>
      <li>The men in our household love this shaver.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;NEVER stays on for more then a minutes (</li>
      <li>and it is one of my favorite</li>
      <li>Shaver is OK but charger- can not believe the Remington sent it to market.</li>
      <li>My s/o has tried so many shavers, razors etc...</li>
      <li>Just some on top of my lips, and under my chin.  </li>
      <li>Just okay.</li>
      <li>I love about this</li>
      <li>Okay.  </li>
      <li>I love</li>
      <li>Just ok</li>
      <li>but I think it is meant more for &amp;#34;burly&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure that I will eventually do change it&#x27;s blades,</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m really happy with this new Remington</li>
      <li>On the up side the trimmer works excellently and the charge holds for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;The shaver and the pop up trimmer do a great job, much better than the pessimist in me predicted to myself , but I gotta tell you, this was one amazing first shave, and my skin feels so good the next day, so smooth and not irritated.</li>
      <li>I am sure it would work perfectly fine for them</li>
      <li>This shaver takes it reasonably easy and doesn&#x27;t produce that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>oh and it&#x27;s easy to separate the blades, or rather take them out.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The device is held together mostly by clicking cheap plastic into cheap plastic.</li>
      <li>Once a week you remove the blades themselves to rinse and lubricated, a process that&#x27;s incredibly easy to do.</li>
      <li>and it easily lasts for the 5 or so minutes it takes me to shave.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to wash too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with the shave it gives and the charge last for many shaves.</li>
      <li>how easy it was to use.  </li>
      <li>The charger looks sleek and doesn&#x27;t take up very much space, the shaver just slips into it kind of like a holster.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and clean, looks great, handles exceptionally well, and seems to have endless battery life.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and clean, looks great, handles exceptionally well, and seems to have endless battery life.</li>
      <li>No need, it falls off quite fine all by itself.</li>
      <li>Most importantly, it cuts cleanly and smoothly.</li>
      <li>Huge mistake.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a battery indicator light on the unit that shows the state of the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>a couple years, when the scars have healed, I&#x27;ll try the next great electric.  </li>
      <li>Also doesn&#x27;t glide smooth across skin, gets stuck on skin.  </li>
      <li>The shaver head is easy to clean and can be rinsed.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>But the intended use to which I want to put the razor is for precisely those times when I lack either the time to lather up or the gel itself.)</li>
      <li>To get completely smooth results</li>
      <li>shaver is easy to take apart and clean.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a comfortable shave in that it doesn&#x27;t pull or catch.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean.</li>
      <li>This electric razor isn&#x27;t nearly as powerful as would be most desirable and it doesn&#x27;t offer a close shave.</li>
      <li>It is fairly light weight and well balanced.</li>
      <li>easy to use and clean, I&#x27;ve used electric razors for while</li>
      <li>free packaging\\&quot;.</li>

    <li> Shaver is OK but charger- can not believe the Remington sent it to market.</li>
    <li> Great shaver for the value.</li>
    <li> Well i like it just getting used to it . Very quiet and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Not a great shave. Just ok</li>
    <li> doen:t cut as good as my shaver I had</li>
    <li> Nice close cut. Last a long time on a charge. Easy to clean. Works well!</li>
    <li> This razor is a TREMENDOUS DISAPPOINTMENT.  I wasn&#x27;t looking for anything fancy when I selected this razor for my husband for Christmas, simply a close shave.  I felt the stubble it left on his face so I tried it on my legs and underarms.  I could go to the store and purchase a traditional razor and go home and shave my legs in less time than it takes to shave with this product.  It takes numerous passes and then you are still left with a substandard shave. I WILL POSITIVELY BE RETURNING THIS PRODUCT.  On a side note, the base you charge the razor on is so flimsy I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to last 3 or 4 months.</li>
    <li> Fast easy shipping. Good price compared to many others. I&#x27;m happy with the shave it gives and the charge last for many shaves.</li>
    <li> Satisfied me exactly.</li>
    <li> It is a lousy shaver, does a lousy job, especially for the first time when the blades are new and sharp.  Also extremely hard to maneuver and get the right angle.  Also doesn&#x27;t glide smooth across skin, gets stuck on skin.  Returned it.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product because is pretty, and mostly because it doesn&#x27;t gets too hot like other shaver have gotten before. The product feels like is made of plastic, which it probably is since it&#x27;s weight is not much at all. The shaving gears are easy to replace, you can actually detach the entire shaving head from the handle. I have not replace any of it just yet but I&#x27;m sure that I will eventually do change it&#x27;s blades, oh and it&#x27;s easy to separate the blades, or rather take them out.</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;burly haired man\\&quot;  (LOL) in my house say that this razor is lightweight and that it feels very nice to hold - it fits his hand perfectly.  My own preference would have been to have a heavier shaver so I would be less likely to drop it when my hands get soapy but I am told I am not a man and I just don&#x27;t understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No tug and pull of the skin.  It is funny because he is used to disposable razors so he really cannot have that much of an opinion on tugging on the skin - plus he had to grow his mustache for over a week to use it.  The young man in my house was thrilled to use this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the stand that it is on.  It is small and compact enough that it can be thrown into a drawer when it is not in use.  There is the small flaw that it is easy for the charger to slip and therefore not charge.  We were not able to get the charger to stand upright while it was charging.</li>
    <li> Not many shavers offer on the box a 60 day money back guarantee.  Try this shaver for 60 days and if you are not satisfied, mail it to Remington for a refund.  They must be very sure that this gives a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am female but have been using men&#x27;s shavers on my legs for years.  This does a great job.  I use it in the shower with shave gel and feel that this gives as close a shave as any I&#x27;ve tried. I recommend this method with this shaver rather than a dry shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this is the way the head pivots. It adjusts to any angle. This keeps down irritation of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also boasts two tracks of shaving blades, and I did not experience any missed hairs on the first pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts 40 minutes before it needs recharging.  This means simply replacing it into the stand when you are finished.  The charging stand is small and I can&#x27;t see it being a problem to bring it along when traveling.  The shaver has a red light that comes on when the battery gets low and when it&#x27;s charging.  The shaver is lightweight and very maneuverable with the three shaving heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington has been making quality shavers since 1937. And they still are.  This is a great shaver, and with a no questions asked guarantee of a refund, and offer to try it out for 60 days or return it for a full refund, I recommend simply getting this and trying it out.  If you don&#x27;t like it send it back.  I think this has enough advantages that most men (and women) will like it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this. This is his first electric razor. While he says the shave isn&#x27;t as close like his regular shaver (I&#x27;m not positive on what he uses) he really likes it and he says it&#x27;s nice to have for days he doesn&#x27;t want to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He could grow a full beard but his hairs are not horribly coarse like. We both think it looks nice, but like I said, we&#x27;ve never owned a shaver before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He likes that it&#x27;s battery operated and would definitely buy one if this were to die.</li>
    <li> This is a decent shaver, but I did not get a close shave with it, had to go over areas repeatedly and had slightly irritated skin after using it.&lt;br /&gt;I have the Remington Interceptor and I prefer it and get a close shave with it.</li>
    <li> In a world where cheap electric razors are fast becoming the norm - the Remington XR1330 is king. I find that as I&#x27;m shaving I&#x27;m also praying - that the rotating heads don&#x27;t fall completely off this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device is held together mostly by clicking cheap plastic into cheap plastic. Taking the head off for cleaning is a &amp;#34;pry job&amp;#34;. I would not recommend this device to anyone who wants to use it more than once or twice.</li>
    <li> The men in our household love this shaver.  Why? Most importantly, it cuts cleanly and smoothly. The pivot head seems to follow faces effortlessly. It makes for a rather quick and easy shave. No having to retrace your steps over and over.  The handle is surprisingly ergonomic and easy to grip. The shaver is fairly lightweight. Overall, it may look a little odd, but it is very functional, and that&#x27;s what counts most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also a plus that the shaver is water resistant. The manual even suggests shaving with gel in the shower for the absolute smoothest experience – just not plugged in to the charger, of course! The shaver head is easy to clean and can be rinsed.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is narrower than our previous shavers, but leaves a very clean cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger is more of a docking station, but apparently this design helps keep the shaver a little lighter and allows it to be more water resistant.</li>
    <li> This Remington Products XR1330 Hyper Series XR3 Rotary Shaver works well for daily use and provides a reasonably close shave both wet and dry. I use this on areas not covered by my full beard, mostly for the neck and cheeks, and it works as well as the older Remington that it is replacing (passing it down to my son).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor mas to be charged in it&#x27;s stand (included) and it easily lasts for the 5 or so minutes it takes me to shave. This is also waterproof for use in the shower but, other than a quick test for the sake of this review, I tend to use it while standing at the sink. The construction feels a little &amp;#34;plasticy&amp;#34; but it has held up and do not have any reason to think that it will be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having a full beard, I do use the popup trimmer just about every other day or so, and am quite pleased with how well it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this works well for my daily shaving needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
    <li> Being Asian, I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair.  Just some on top of my lips, and under my chin.  I normally use a Gilette Fusion Pro-Glide and get a very clean shave with that blade.  This is my first time using a rotary shaver, and I was impressed.  I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but I did like how easy it was to use.  However, it did not get a close enough shave as a blade, but it is smooth and quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only have to shave every 3 days or so, so the battery should last me through 2 shaves before needing a full charge.  It is great that it is cordless and can be used in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it, but I think it is meant more for &amp;#34;burly&amp;#34; men.  I just don&#x27;t have enough hair for this shaver.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a great shaver, but works fairly well. I can&#x27;t get nearly as close a shave as I can with disposable razors, which this (and pretty much every other shaver around) promises. But it is quick, lightweight, and easy to clean, and the battery lasts quite a while between charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somewhat surprisingly, the instructions recommend using this product in the shower, with shaving cream. I have found that the shave is a bit more even when doing so than when shaving dry. (However, recommending that one use shaving cream and not shave dry seems to defeat what should be the benefit of an electric shaver, being able to quickly shave without much preparation or cleanup.) It is fully immersible and has yet to pinch, cut, or cause any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General cleaning is a matter of popping off the head, rinsing, and allowing to dry, which is quick and simple (particularly if used in the shower, since it&#x27;s already under running water that&#x27;s rinsed off much of the stubble and gunk before the head is even removed). If required for travel (which I&#x27;m not sure would be necessary, as the battery power seems more than sufficient for most trips), the base folds up easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it would not be up to par for someone requiring a close shave every day, it is convenient for those of us who, most days, simply want to keep the five o&#x27;clock shadow from being too obvious. However, I&#x27;ll keep the disposable razors on hand for whenever I need to have a thorough, clean shave.</li>
    <li> Its smooth and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a blade kind of guy.  Sure, I&#x27;ve tried and own a number of razors including a never Panasonic foil wet/dry shaver and a Norelco Rotary Electric Razor, but I don&#x27;t use them because they can&#x27;t shave as close as a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this Remington does indeed shave as close as a blade does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial instructions suggested charging for 24 hours, but my unit only took about 2 hours to charge and would not charge further than that.  I have used this razor with Gillette gel, so it was a wet shave and not a dry one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I typically use a blade, my face is not used to an electric razor.  So it&#x27;s a little bit sore, but not much.  And shaving with this Remington XR1330 rotary electric razor did take me longer to shave versus a razor.  That probably because I&#x27;m not used to the thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was immediately drawn to the floating shave head design.  It pivots generously and looks as if it will conform nicely to the contours of your face.  It does exactly that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But no matter how you cut it (pardon the pun), I didn&#x27;t think that an electric razor could shave as close as a blade can, with virtually no leftover stubble.  Guess I was wrong.  Highly recommended 5 star product.&lt;br /&gt;\</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for few months now and it works great. I love it&#x27;s sleek design, flexible blades and modular structure. It&#x27;s easy to wash too. Only drawback is that it can be charged only with a base station, can&#x27;t connect directly to charger.</li>
    <li> Was missing the owners manual, otherwise it seems to be fine.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband (who doesn&#x27;t need to shave every day) to just trim a little between razor shaves. The problem with it is, if you use it without shave gel it pulls/rips hairs out. And if he needs to put gel on he&#x27;d rather just use a razor. So into the drawer of unused bathroom appliances it goes.</li>
    <li> After the initial charge, this shaver has an outstanding battery life. It lasted nearly a month with daily facial shaving before it needed to be charged again. The charge light and charging light on the shaver are very dim, and the lights are only visible when the shaver is in use. This makes it a bit difficult to tell that it needs charging until the shaver is pretty much dead. The charging station is nice and simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself provides a clean, close shave, but it works best with shaving cream as it tends to stick rather than glide across the face without it. It works great both in and out of the shower. The blade area of the side of the heads are a bit thick which makes it difficult to get to tight areas (like around the nose). The side burn trimmer is built right into the unit (no changing of heads required) which makes it quick and easy to use. It works well on both longer and shorter facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is easy to take apart and clean. It&#x27;s a solid wet/dry shaver.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever used a rotary shaver, I&#x27;ve only used a standard electric or regular blades in the past and I was surprised how great it shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the initial 24 hr charge, I found that the charging display light did not stay on, but it did charge and the technician at Remington told me that the light would work correctly after the power runs out and it&#x27;s being recharged again.  If there is any problem, I will update this review and report here.&lt;br /&gt; but lets get to the shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t shave for a week, once I had ordered this razor, I quit shaving so I could test this baby out and it did a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised how smoothly and how quickly it dispensed with my weeks worth of facial hair, usually with my old electric razors, they would balk at a thicker growth but this cool shaver took it on and performed nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver feels good in my hands and operates nicely, it&#x27;s lightweight but it feels solid and ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver and the pop up trimmer do a great job, much better than the pessimist in me predicted to myself , but I gotta tell you, this was one amazing first shave, and my skin feels so good the next day, so smooth and not irritated. After taking off such a thick growth, I expected the skin not to be happy but I feel great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did my shave totally dry but I look forward to taking this razor in the shower and trying out the wet shave that this can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great shaver at a bargain price and I&#x27;m really happy with this new Remington</li>
    <li> Ever since I was old enough to shave, I&#x27;ve wanted to be able to use an electric shaver. Not to save time, necessarily, but because I like gadgets. And in all that time (over three decades), I&#x27;ve NEVER found one that worked on my beard. I&#x27;ve tried every brand and style, and some, in addition to being ineffective, just hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then along came the XR1330, and everything changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes out of the box, you&#x27;re instructed to charge it for 24 hours before first use. I did so, and have not had to recharge it since. I&#x27;m up to 23 days without plugging it in, which is staggering to me. I use it about 4 times a week, by the way, and my wife uses it on her legs occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But so what? I mean, all the battery life in the world means nothing if the thing doesn&#x27;t work, right? Well it does, and it works great. I&#x27;ve tried it dry, which can get a bit uncomfortable but still works fine, and in the shower, which is my preferred method. No shave cream or gel, I just soap my face up and get to work. The 1330 shaves me comfortably and cleanly every time, and I have at last stopped shaving (my face) with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanup is a total breeze - just take blade structure off and rinse it and the body out. Once a week you remove the blades themselves to rinse and lubricated, a process that&#x27;s incredibly easy to do. Each blade and socket is color coded so you know it&#x27;s going back together correctly. According to the instructions, the blade assembly lasts for about six months. I&#x27;ve found the replacement on Amazon for under $25, which nets out to under $4 a month: cheaper than blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned my wife uses it for her legs: she loves it. Really, really loves it. She tried another brand I tested some time ago and it was useless - this one is a keeper for her as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives? Only two: I shave my head, and this does not do a job comparable to a good razor there. I&#x27;ve read other reviews that said it&#x27;s great for that, but I still prefer my Mach 3. Also, there&#x27;s no battery level indicator, only a light that supposedly lights up when it&#x27;s time to recharge it. I don&#x27;t know if that light works though, because I&#x27;ve been running it on a single charge since I got it. A luxury problem, there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any razor that works on my face is great in my book, and this one works great. It&#x27;s easy to use and clean, looks great, handles exceptionally well, and seems to have endless battery life. A real winner.ill prefer my Mach 3.

    <li> Shaves decently though it does still leave some stubble on my upper lip area as it is quite difficult to maneoveor the shaver round without pinching skin around the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge seems to hold up for some time which is good and lasted over 2 different days between my shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a decent product that is well-shaped for holding and surprising quiet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for about a month and it has provided me a quality shaving experience. So far, I&#x27;ve only had to recharge this twice. The small built in trimmer is useful to getting to the ear hair. Cleaning and maintenance is fairly simplistic on the unit.  Overall, this is a solid performer and I hope to get several years of use out of it.</li>
    <li> Although I feel a little bad giving this Remington Shaver only three stars; for my personal use it only rates as such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I say so, is that this razor has a great feel, and has a really a comfortable shaving surface.  I really liked how it fit in my hand and the unit flexed perfectly going around the corners of my jaw and neck line.  The reason for the three star review though, is that it has a very weak motor and it doesn&#x27;t do well actually removing my facial hair.  I have to spend an excessively long period of time shaving in the morning in order to get a close shave required of my job.  Other electric razors I have used (Norelco especially) have much more powerful motors, taking the hair away much faster without going over the same spot again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think that this particular razor would work very well for a younger man (teens/early 20&#x27;s) who haven&#x27;t developed thicker fuller beards, or for men with generally lighter facial hair.  I am sure it would work perfectly fine for them and I would highly recommend it in that regard.  I am in my mid to late 30&#x27;s and have thick stubble within hours of shaving, so for me it just isn&#x27;t as efficient as I would have liked it to be.</li>
    <li> Only relatively close shave with pre-shave on a tough beard.  Charger has an intermittent contact when the stand is not carefully placed. Still a good wet and dry shaver and reasonable mid market positioning.</li>
    <li> My s/o has tried so many shavers, razors etc...his hair on his face and chest grows so fast that having a shaver around is a must for him. He stated that this one in particular was just ok, he had to press it firmly against his face in order to get a close shave, so he say. I can tell that he wont be using this one as frequently. It does charge up pretty fast, and has an overall nice look to it. It can also be used in water which he has yet to try.</li>
    <li> I purchased a Norelco at Costco $99 and it came with 2 sets of blades and numerous other gadgets. I noticed the motor ran the slowest of any shaver. After I finished the shave I had stubble everywhere. I went over and over the stubble and it would not get it off so I used a regular Gillette Fusion to clean it up. I took it back to Costco and went to Frys and bought the Remington XR1330 for $49 and It&#x27;s the best, fastest and cleanest&lt;br /&gt;shaver I ever used. I&#x27;m 64 and been shaving a long time with many different brands. This is my favorite by far.</li>
    <li> In terms of a tight shave and clean finish this Remington XR1330 gets an &#x27;ok&#x27; mark. To get completely smooth results you&#x27;re gonna have to get used to this device for a few weeks - particularly how it adjusts to the contours of your face in order to get accustomed to finding the spots where you will have to make several passes to properly finish the trim. The power feels a bit on the low side which is why getting clean results in one pass is not possible - but again the results are decent once you get used to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanup of the product is quick and easy and I prefer to use this as a shower shaver - trimming off as much as I can on the face and then cleaning it up afterward at the sink. Overall not to bad for a mid-range shaver with decent battery life, nice physical design and reasonable (if a bit fussy) shave finish.</li>
    <li> works great and as listed.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend says it works great for his face.</li>
    <li> Very  Smooth running and holds the charge for a few weeks with everyday use..i would recommend for anyone that doesn&#x27;t want to spend alot for a great shaver</li>
    <li> This was received on Saturday and has been used three times so far.&lt;br /&gt;This is an ergonomically designed shaver in the mid size price range. My husband was the tester though I actually did use this on my legs and forearms as well.&lt;br /&gt;The things that make this a desirable shaver is its long tapered arm that is very easy to both hold and grip. Additionally, this shaver has three floating heads that gently shave and is easy to clean by releasing by releasing the shaving heads and removing the collected debris. The best feature is the maneuverability of the heads to get into tight areas without issues such as knicking.&lt;br /&gt;While I thought it gave a clean shave on my legs and arms, my husband &#x27;s only criticism was that he felt it did not give a close enough shave and left some minor and  virtually imperceivable  stubble.&lt;br /&gt;One other plus is that this product if much faster than using a manual razor and definitely safer.&lt;br /&gt;Factoring cost, efficiency, construction,and performance, this is a 4* shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that I know an electric razor will never give as close or clean of a shave as an actual blade. I realize that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, compared to my two Norelco electric razors, this one disappoints. It doesn&#x27;t shave anywhere near as close, or leave my face as clean as the Norelcos do. The heads seem anemic when turned on, almost like the battery is dying, even though it&#x27;s got a full charge. I also found I didn&#x27;t like the shape of the head itself, it made maneuvering it around my face hard. Each time I used this thing I had to follow up with my Norelco (which costs less and works better) to get an acceptable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t like that Remington recommends shaving in the shower with a lathered face. I tried it once, and while it worked A BIT better, it&#x27;s too much of a hassle. I always shave my face dry. Another thing I don&#x27;t like about this is the charging stand that&#x27;s mandatory for charging the shaver. I realize that this is because the machine is sealed against water and they couldn&#x27;t put a charging port for that reason, but it&#x27;s a hassle to have to put it on a stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is light, quiet, and holds a charge for about a week, like my Norelcos. However, it&#x27;s dismal performance leaves me going back to the Norelco. One other factor that matters to me, perhaps not to others, is that the Norelcos I have are made in the Netherlands, this one is made in China. Oh, and this product would probably benefit from \\&quot;frustration free packaging\\&quot;. Although not a deal breaker, getting it out of the packaging took some work.</li>
    <li> Edit 11/6/15: Same as below, it still works. I may buy a new set of heads.&lt;br /&gt;__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;Edit 12/13/14: What I said about the &amp;#34;blue clip&amp;#34; &amp; about the heads being somewhat dull when the razor was brand new still stands. HOWEVER, I have NEVER seen any Electric razor retain it&#x27;s COMPLETE original sharpness this long. Adding 2 Stars.&lt;br /&gt;__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;Edit 9/4/14: The design engineer did an AWFUL job. There is a blue &amp;#34;Clip&amp;#34; (for lack of a better word) that is supposed to hold the cutters in place. It fails horribly, it is nearly impossible to put back on when it falls off, &amp; the directions are incredibly vague. Remington actually wants the end user to remove the clip weekly. No need, it falls off quite fine all by itself. Don&#x27;t waste your money until they hire competent engineers.&lt;br /&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;Edit 8/30/14: I have discovered the &amp;#34;weekly cleaning&amp;#34; is necessary. The&lt;br /&gt;illustrations in the booklet are worthless (they do not explain how the&lt;br /&gt;parts go back together when it&#x27;s totally disassembled). I spent over an hour&lt;br /&gt;trying to put this THING back together. I finally got it seconds before&lt;br /&gt;the garbage can got it. THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR MAKING AN APPLIANCE AT&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRICE POINT SO USER UNFRIENDLY.&lt;br /&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;Edit 8/21/14: today, while doing the daily cleaning, the entire head assembly fell apart &amp; other than the lubricating oil, I ended up doing the weekly cleaning whether I wanted to or not. Fortunately I was able to put it back together. This sort of behavior concerns me; it seems to be a consistent indicator of Remington lack of quality.&lt;br /&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;Original review before the &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; issues:&lt;br /&gt;This is the 4th full Electric Razor I&#x27;ve reviewed for Amazon, the 3rd&lt;br /&gt;Remington, the 6th Electric, &amp; the 7th non disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I would like to find is a reliable razor, with significant&lt;br /&gt;longevity of both razor &amp; blades &amp; inexpensive replacement blades/heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far no luck, though i will obviously need more time to get a better&lt;br /&gt;idea of the longevity on this unit (the most expensive I&#x27;ve reviewed,&lt;br /&gt;but not the best shave.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveat: I have very thick facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Re-reading my previous reviews, I would rank the quality of shave of the&lt;br /&gt;9 razors I&#x27;ve used over the last few years (until the blades dull) as&lt;br /&gt;follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.

But for now:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;1. It works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s expensive ($79.97 list price)&lt;br /&gt;2. The plastic cover that protects the Roaters is very hard to get on &amp;&lt;br /&gt;it broke at 3 days&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The daily cleaning is easy enough, but they also want a weekly&lt;br /&gt;cleaning that requires a special purchase of lubricating oil. looks like&lt;br /&gt;a big pain, &amp; as I have had Remington Roaters completely break before, i&lt;br /&gt;am very gun shy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. There appears to be something wrong with the charging cradle. It&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;flimsy, &amp; even when it first arrived (without a full charge) I had to&lt;br /&gt;hold it down tightly to get the charging light to come on, &amp; the light&lt;br /&gt;NEVER stays on for more then a minutes (usually 10 seconds)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I can&#x27;t currently comment on the cost of replacement heads, as&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see it quoted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Uncertain, but concerned that the shave isn&#x27;t all that good for&lt;br /&gt;an expensive electric.on the cost of replacement heads, as I don&#x27;t see it quoted.  Verdict: Uncertain, but concerned that the shave isn&#x27;t all that good for an expensive electric.</li>
    <li> Just okay. This electric razor isn&#x27;t nearly as powerful as would be most desirable and it doesn&#x27;t offer a close shave. There&#x27;s just something about the three heads that doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as a single blade. It is easier to clean that the electric, three head razors of previous years, but that doesn&#x27;t matter so much if it isn&#x27;t powerful and doesn&#x27;t offer a clean shave.</li>
    <li> I have worn a beard since I was 19 years old. That has been several decades at this point. For me, shavers need to be powerful, comfortable and precise in the way they cut facial hair. The Remington XR1330 Hyper Series XR3 Rotary Shaver is a perfectly serviceable shaver. It holds a charge well enough to get through a week of shaving for me. It manages to effectively clear my coarse beard with little stubble left behind and it is maneuverable enough to shape and contour around my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As rotary shavers go, this one has a nice ergonomic design that fits well in my hand. That allows me to effectively guide the shaver as I shape my beard. It is fairly light weight and well balanced. The XR1330 is pretty quite for a rotary shaver and the vibration in the hand and on the face is perfectly acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to comfort, the shaver doesn&#x27;t pull and tear at the whiskers any worse than the other rotary systems I&#x27;ve used. When drawing the shaver across the face it doesn&#x27;t tend to snag whiskers in the way some rotary razors do. With some rotary shavers I&#x27;ve had, the blades tended to draw the skin into the cutting head to the point that it actually irritated the skin. There were times I ended up with large angry red patches on my neck. This shaver takes it reasonably easy and doesn&#x27;t produce that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The XR1330 produces a shave that is as close as any shaver I&#x27;ve used to this point. In my experience NO electric shaver ever produces a truly close shave and I&#x27;ve used at least a dozen over the years. This one does a good job. It takes away the shaft completely above the skin. The stubble left at skin level are very short and not visible. When you run your hand along your neck you can feel them, but, as I said, that is par for all electric shavers on my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use electric shavers for wet shaving and didn&#x27;t try this one under those conditions so I can&#x27;t comment on how it performs. Although it doesn&#x27;t say so in the product description, this shaver is supposed to work either dry or wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the down side, the shaver doesn&#x27;t dock very well with the charging station and it takes quite a while for a full charge. As I said the charge last long enough for me, but since I have a full beard I don&#x27;t spend as much time shaving as someone with no beard. It may not hold as long as some people need it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t like the way the head comes apart for cleaning. The blades just sit loose in the safety cage and tend to jump out when you take the assembly apart (so watch out). If that isn&#x27;t bad enough, instead of allowing the replacement of the blades, the  Remington XR1330 requires that you replace the entire cutting head. At 25-30 bucks a pop, that represents nearly half the cost of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the  Remington XR1330 is a good shaver for the money. With the exception of a few design flaws that don&#x27;t impact the quality of the shave, it gets the job done.duct description, this shaver is supposed to work either dry or wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the down side, the shaver doesn&#x27;t dock very well with the charging station and it takes quite a while for a full charge.

    <li> My husband typically uses disposable razors, but has used rotary shavers in the past. He said that this Hyper Series Rotary Shaver gave him the best shave he&#x27;s had.The head pivots when shaving and does not pull on the hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself feels solid and well-constructed. The charger looks sleek and doesn&#x27;t take up very much space, the shaver just slips into it kind of like a holster. There&#x27;s a battery indicator light on the unit that shows the state of the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It offered a close shave (his cheeks felt super smooth after using it) and didn&#x27;t cause any irritation. He absolutely loves it (and I love that the stubble is gone).</li>
    <li> received in two days which is always awesome! easy to use and clean, I&#x27;ve used electric razors for while and it is one of my favorite I have ever bought. would buy again and recommend!</li>
    <li> I did not realize until I received this razor to review that last year I had received its richer brother, the [[ASIN:B00EKQLNQK Remington Products XR1370 Hyper Series Rotary Shaver]], to review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than a few \\&quot;luxury\\&quot; features on that model, they&#x27;re mechanically the same razor in the same series.  Both are impressive in initial quality:  out of the box, they&#x27;re the best Remington shavers, BY FAR, that I&#x27;ve ever used.  I initially rated the XR1370 with 4 stars; subsequently, I reduced it to 2 stars (see below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model is a bit on the \\&quot;aggressive\\&quot; side for a rotary.  On my first use, it tore through a 3-day growth of beard faster than the best Norelco I&#x27;ve ever owned could.  However, that \\&quot;aggressiveness\\&quot; comes at some costs.  While I can complete shaving my face more quickly with it than any other razor I&#x27;ve ever tried, the ultimate shave is not really that close, even if you grind away at your face endlessly.  Also, with eager blades, it may not be the best choice for those with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here I&#x27;m repeating verbatim what I&#x27;d thought about the XR1370, but they&#x27;re essentially the same razor, so....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS --&lt;br /&gt;1) Speed;&lt;br /&gt;2) Price;&lt;br /&gt;3) Moderately close shave;&lt;br /&gt;4) BRILLIANTLY simple color-coding scheme to index blades to screens -- something Norelco should have come up with LONG ago;&lt;br /&gt;5) Offers wet-shaving and does a fairly good job at it;&lt;br /&gt;6) Relatively quick to charge (slower-to-charge battery on the XR1330 -- part of the reason for the price difference);&lt;br /&gt;7) Clever travel lock-up design on charger;&lt;br /&gt;8) Relatively useful sideburn trimmer (which I&#x27;ve never seen on a Norelco).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS --&lt;br /&gt;1) Only moderately close shave;&lt;br /&gt;2) Nicked me a number of times, which I don&#x27;t think has ever happened with a Norelco;&lt;br /&gt;3) Lacks an internal drain, which makes shaving at the sink (not just in the shower) possible without a mess on some Norelcos;&lt;br /&gt;4) While wet shaving, head clogs up frequently, requiring partial disassembly to clean out several times during a wet-shave;&lt;br /&gt;5) Head assembly feels a bit more fragile than I&#x27;m comfortable with, though not terribly so, and heads don&#x27;t float as much as I&#x27;m used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion -- In initial quality, this razor, much like its XR1370 sibling, is quite the impressive product from Remington.  However, having had the chance to use that XR1370 for months rather than days, it left me fairly concerned about this XR1330, which is the \\&quot;bargain-priced\\&quot; sibling in this family of Remington rotaries:  after two months of use, the XR1370&#x27;s beard trimmer literally fell clean off of the razor body; after another month, the floating-head assembly broke off (one could say it \\&quot;self-decapitated,\\&quot; very conclusively ending its life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, I like this XR1330 very much, but if you buy one, I&#x27;d register its warranty and keep your receipt -- it does carry a 2-year warranty with registration, so if something goes wrong....  Best of luck!gs up frequently, requiring partial disassembly to clean out several times during a wet-shave;&lt;br /&gt;5) Head assembly feels a bit more fragile than I&#x27;m comfortable with, though not terribly so, and heads don&#x27;t float as much as I&#x27;m used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion -- In initial quality, this razor, much like its XR1370 sibling, is quite the impressive product from Remington.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Gillette cartridge guy for 25 years, and every few years (usually around Father&#x27;s Day or Christmas) the deluge of electric razor ads promising to cut \\&quot;as close as a razor\\&quot; drives me to try one.  It never really works.  It&#x27;s been about 5 years since my last one, so I decided to try the XR3 hoping the newest tech would be good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;m a guy, I don&#x27;t read instructions.  I just turned on the XR3 and started swirling it around my face like the people in the adverts.  Huge mistake.  About 1/3 of the hair got trimmed (not cut, it&#x27;s not that close), 1/3 wouldn&#x27;t trim, and 1/3 were just ripped out altogether.  So after a couple minutes my skin looked like I&#x27;d dragged it across a cheese grater and felt even worse.  And I still had to shave behind it with a cartridge to be presentable for work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to read the instructions after all, which say that Remington highly recommends using a shaving gel when shaving.  Well no offense, but how can I be like those time-savvy dudes shaving in their cars at the stop light if I have to lather up first?  Sigh.  Okay.  Well that made the skin less irritated and put the shave closer to 60% trimmed, 40% missed, no pulls.  An improvement of sorts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manual also says that the skin really needs four weeks before it&#x27;s used to shaving with an electric.  Maybe.  But by my skin is apparently as slow a learner as the rest of me and after two weeks (with gel) my face was still getting torn up daily, so opted not to subject myself to another two weeks of torture.  On the up side the trimmer works excellently and the charge holds for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a couple years, when the scars have healed, I&#x27;ll try the next great electric.  For now, I&#x27;ll stick with my [[ASIN:B000HCZ34E Sensor]].</li>
    <li> My husband gives this electric shaver an enthusiastic two thumbs up. He says it does a great job of shaving close, even on his neck which is sometimes difficult with electric razors. I borrowed it to shave my legs just to test out the shaver since I&#x27;m the one writing the review and I have to agree with him that it does do a very close shave. It&#x27;s also a comfortable shave in that it doesn&#x27;t pull or catch. The three floating rotary shave heads have a lot of pivoting ability to conform to the shape of your face or neck so it&#x27;s easy to get it to tight places like around the ears. But one of the nicest features Is that it&#x27;s a lot quieter than his previous shavers. If I&#x27;m still sleeping in the morning when he gets up to shave, it doesn&#x27;t wake me up, even with the bathroom door open to our bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also fits in the hand comfortably thanks to its ergonomic design. It charges up in a couple of hours that gives you about 40 minutes of shaving time.</li>
    <li> This shaver is a wet/dry shaver, but I used it dry. For wet shaves, I use a blade. I&#x27;ve never found that an electric shaver gets as close as a blade. This one is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One plus is that this works out of the box. (That&#x27;s a good thing because it took me far too long to figure out how to charge it. The razor has to be put into a converter, and the plug goes into the side of the converter. I didn&#x27;t see the place to plug it in for a while since I wasn&#x27;t looking at the side of the base.) I found that the shave was OK for when I&#x27;m on the run. I didn&#x27;t look as scruffy, but I certainly could feel the stubble. I also noticed a great number of pinches, presumably hairs being pulled out. (Remember, I used this dry.) What I want in an electric razor is not something for daily use since I have blades for that but for those times when I&#x27;m running late and need a shave before I head to work or out in public in general. This works, but I could do without the pinches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;ve seen that using a gel helps, and I suppose it might. But the intended use to which I want to put the razor is for precisely those times when I lack either the time to lather up or the gel itself.)</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver. Quality product. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Trimmer is to small and tends to grab rather than cut cleanly.  Head cleaning is not as easy as with my old Norelco.</li>
