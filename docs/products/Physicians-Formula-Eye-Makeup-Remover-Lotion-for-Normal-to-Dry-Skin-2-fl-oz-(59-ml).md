    <li> I have sensitive skin and I have found this product that gently and effectively removes mascara without causing any irritation.  It is a cream formula that makes my skin feel better.  I prefer it to an oily remover that tends to creep into my eye area causing irritation.  Buy it as it is effective and safe.</li>
    <li> Best eye makeup remover</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of makeup removers and when I found this one I was thrilled!  Lotion-y, not oily, leave no irritating residue and removes whatever eye makeup I&#x27;m wearing quickly and easily.</li>

Because I&#x27;ve always had good luck with PF, and the Avon brand isn&#x27;t what it used to be, I picked it up with high expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This formula is gentle and lotion-like and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes but it takes way all other makeup BUT MASCARA, be it waterproof or not. I&#x27;d rub and rub, scrub and scrub, wipe with a cotton ball, see lots of mascara on my lashes so I repeat but no matter what, the mascara is there and afterwards, my eyes are red and raw. And some mascara is still present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love PF products. They&#x27;re affordable, gentle and I&#x27;ve been using their stuff for years. Unfortunately, this one is a miss.</li>

    <li> i bought this eye make up remover and even though i don&#x27;t wear waterproof mascara, this remover doesn&#x27;t remove anyhting at all. after scrubbing my eyes with it my lashes were all sticky and the next morning you look like a zombie because there is black all around your eyes. do not buy!</li>
    <li> I have tried many makeup removers for the eyes, this by far is the best I have ever used.  Never burns yours eyes, takes off even waterproof mascara with no problem.  It&#x27;s definitely something I try never to be out of!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and can&#x27;t  find it in stores! I love the consistency, it&#x27;s between a gel and a lotion. Great product.</li>
    <li> The only one I use, but it&#x27;s hard to find in-store. This eye makeup remover is easier to use than the liquid; it stays where you use it whereas the liquid is messy &amp; gets in your eyes easier &amp; it&#x27;s harder to get out of your eyes. Used this product for years but like I said it&#x27;s very hard to find in any store anymore.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for decades...love it cause it&#x27;s a non-eye-stinging cream that easily removes all types of mascara.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife who always buys it in the local stores.  Well, with the economy, all the local stores stopped stocking it.  So, I went online and found this one.  The price, together with shipping cost, totaled to just about what we used to pay for it in the local stores, so I&#x27;m buying it here from now on!  My wife says that the stuff is terrific, but it&#x27;s hard to find.  Get it here!</li>
    <li> This is the best product to remove makeup.  Never found a product that takes off mascara like this with no tears if it gets in your eyes.</li>
    <li> Happy to find on-line, as most retailers  in my area no longer stock this product. Excellent mascara remover. Gentle and non-drying. I have been using this product for several years.</li>
    <li> I started using this at least 20 years ago and lately I have been searching everywhere for it.  I can&#x27;t find it in any store(the only con)and am happy it is here!  Before I wash my face, I put a large drop on my pointer fingers then rub it on my closed eye lashes.  I rinse with water then pat dry and do one more time with less.  Then I wash my face.  This lotion is the best because it does not leave any make-up or residue behind like oil does to irritate your eyes and you do not need to use a cotton ball.</li>
