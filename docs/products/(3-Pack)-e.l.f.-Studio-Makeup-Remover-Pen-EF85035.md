### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The service provided from the seller was excellent , it&#x27;s the product that doesnt measure up.</li>
      <li>lol!!!</li>
      <li>THIS PRODUCT WORKA GREAT, BUT GET IT CHEAPER!</li>
      <li>Just as good as the Revlon brand that now raised their price to $25!  </li>
      <li>The makeup wipes are great.</li>
      <li>loved it very smooth</li>
      <li>The tip fits nicely under my lower lashes, getting the mascara off the eyelid but not removing any mascara from my eyelashes.  </li>
      <li>Maybe these pens ought to come with many replaceable tips or something.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m pleased that this pen works so well on it.  </li>
      <li>Fabulous!  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Just gently twirl point in a tissue after use and it&#x27;s good to go.</li>
      <li>The lid is secure so this would be portable (for example, if you were out and about and were wearing mascara or eyeliner that started to run).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When I&#x27;m doing my makeup and mess up this pen helps to clean up the job and make it look picture perfect.</li>
      <li>pen tip should be cleaned with a tissue after every use to keep it clean.</li>
      <li>This makeup remover works perfectly, especially with mascara &amp;#34;gone astray.&amp;#34;  Good price as well.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
      <li>practical and erase quickly</li>
      <li>but, now that I&#x27;ve been using it about a month, it is just right.</li>
      <li>Wiping the pen clean does not do much.</li>
      <li>the past I&#x27;ve used The Revlon Makeup Eraser pen, a great product, but the price has gone sky-high.</li>
      <li>It is makeup remover in a felt-tip pen, so it has great accuracy for small areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have the most issues getting it on my lower eyelids, but sometimes I&#x27;ll get it on my upper eyelids or even cheek</li>
      <li>As a result, I have edited my review to remove the first paragraph about how inflated the price was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>/&gt;I will say that when I first got it, I found it OVER oily with makeup remover</li>
      <li>I really like the way you can touch up you eye makeup with the e.l.f.</li>
      <li>Very cool&lt;br /&gt;Beginners need to learn make-up&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>I tried this product because the Revlon Eraser Pen has disappeared and apparently is no longer ever going to be available again.</li>
      <li>I am glad they come in a pack of 3 due to my quantity of mistakes.</li>
      <li>I have found that that particular mascara is particularly resistant to makeup removers</li>
      <li>would highly recommend these to anyone who wears make-up</li>
      <li>That worked, but always involved a little more liquid than I wanted to use.  </li>
      <li>I did not realize when I initially wrote my review (because I did not buy the product on Amazon) that this particular seller sells packs of THREE Elf Makeup Remover Pens, which explains why the price is so much higher than what I paid for ONE pen elsewhere.</li>
      <li>It is useful for its purpose of removing eye makeup mistakes, which is nice; however, I agree with the reviewer who said it becomes pretty useless in a relatively short time.</li>
      <li>I have already used it a couple of different times and it really works.  </li>
      <li>Even if you wipe the tip with a tissue, it doesn&#x27;t really clean the makeup off the pen, and mine dried up completely by the end of like two weeks even though I kept the cap on when I wasn&#x27;t using it.</li>
      <li>I got my first one of these in an e.l.f. Beauty Bundle but would definitely re-purchase the item separately when my current one starts wearing out.</li>
      <li>Sharp point always stays moist and easily removes tiny errors or bigger blobs.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a fairly fine, stiff tip, so you only use the product where you want it and not anywhere else.  </li>
      <li>far I&#x27;ve only tried this to get e.l.f.</li>

    <li> This product is a life saver. When I&#x27;m doing my makeup and mess up this pen helps to clean up the job and make it look picture perfect. I&#x27;m going to need to stock up on these because I mess up my makeup often.</li>
    <li> Very cool&lt;br /&gt;Beginners need to learn make-up&lt;br /&gt;Very practical and erase quickly&lt;br /&gt;I loved it very smooth&lt;br /&gt;The same specification Almdhurh</li>
    <li> These inexpensive little pens remove all my mascara mistakes with precision.  I am glad they come in a pack of 3 due to my quantity of mistakes.</li>
    <li> This makeup remover works perfectly, especially with mascara &amp;#34;gone astray.&amp;#34;  Good price as well.&lt;br /&gt;In the past I&#x27;ve used The Revlon Makeup Eraser pen, a great product, but the price has gone sky-high.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because the Revlon Eraser Pen has disappeared and apparently is no longer ever going to be available again. This is an attempt at the same solution to smudged make up, but just doesnt measure up. The pointed tip of the pen is way too sharp and does not clean off after use. The service provided from the seller was excellent , it&#x27;s the product that doesnt measure up.</li>
    <li> I almost never manage to put mascara on without getting some somewhere besides my eyelashes.  I have the most issues getting it on my lower eyelids, but sometimes I&#x27;ll get it on my upper eyelids or even cheek (don&#x27;t ask).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before, I was dipping Q-Tips in my Clinique &amp;#34;Take the Day Off&amp;#34; makeup remover.  That worked, but always involved a little more liquid than I wanted to use.  I was worried about drying time/getting it off, and I was worried about the liquid spreading and removing makeup that I didn&#x27;t want removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I found this eye makeup remover pen.  I have already used it a couple of different times and it really works.  It sort of feels like a marker so it&#x27;s not dripping liquid anywhere.  There&#x27;s a fairly fine, stiff tip, so you only use the product where you want it and not anywhere else.  The tip fits nicely under my lower lashes, getting the mascara off the eyelid but not removing any mascara from my eyelashes.  The lid is secure so this would be portable (for example, if you were out and about and were wearing mascara or eyeliner that started to run).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve only tried this to get e.l.f. volume plumping mascara off my skin.  I have found that that particular mascara is particularly resistant to makeup removers so I&#x27;m pleased that this pen works so well on it.  I got my first one of these in an e.l.f. Beauty Bundle but would definitely re-purchase the item separately when my current one starts wearing out.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3GYF70NFZPVDS]]EDITED REVIEW: I did not realize when I initially wrote my review (because I did not buy the product on Amazon) that this particular seller sells packs of THREE Elf Makeup Remover Pens, which explains why the price is so much higher than what I paid for ONE pen elsewhere. As a result, I have edited my review to remove the first paragraph about how inflated the price was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product as it has saved me a lot of time during makeup application when I otherwise would have had to remove makeup and start again. It is makeup remover in a felt-tip pen, so it has great accuracy for small areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that when I first got it, I found it OVER oily with makeup remover but, now that I&#x27;ve been using it about a month, it is just right. It still gets the job done but does not give off excess liquid/oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pen tip should be cleaned with a tissue after every use to keep it clean.</li>
    <li> BUY CHEAPER ON EYESLIPSFACE.COM. THIS IS A RIP OFF. THIS PRODUCT WORKA GREAT, BUT GET IT CHEAPER!</li>
    <li> The pen is too hard for under the eyes and it basically is useless after one or two uses. Wiping the pen clean does not do much. It become ineffective after 2-3 uses. I would not buy again. The makeup wipes are great.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I don&#x27;t leave home without it...lol!!! It does what it says it does. Makeup eraser pen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Henrietta</li>
    <li> I really like the way you can touch up you eye makeup with the e.l.f. Studio Makeup Remover Pens.</li>
    <li> Fabulous!  Just as good as the Revlon brand that now raised their price to $25!  Works well, with no grease or oil. Sharp point always stays moist and easily removes tiny errors or bigger blobs. Just gently twirl point in a tissue after use and it&#x27;s good to go. It also lasts for months.</li>
