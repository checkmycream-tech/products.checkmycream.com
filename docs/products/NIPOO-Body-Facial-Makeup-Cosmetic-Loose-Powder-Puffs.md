    <li> I was looking for replacement puffs for the one I have been using for years. My current puff was a gift, and I didn&#x27;t want to pay what it costs to replace it if I didn&#x27;t have to. I was pleased to find these when I did a search on amazon. I am happy that I found a great replacement and even happier that I didn&#x27;t have to spend a fortune on them!</li>
    <li> They are okay but not worth the money!  Will not purchase again.</li>

    <li> These took a very long time for delivery. When they arrived, they had a chemical smell to them. I washed them, and they seem fine. I haven&#x27;t started using them yet, but don&#x27;t anticipate any problems. They seem well made and soft.</li>
    <li> What a joke . they are not as large as they advertised. I wan&#x27;t to return them if I can ever get a return address, or what else I need to send them back.</li>
    <li> Much smaller than I thought.  Should have checked it out further before ordering.</li>
    <li> Poor quality.  During first use the pad left bits of fluff all over my face.  I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> not what I was expecting. They are very little. Not what it looks like on the picture</li>
