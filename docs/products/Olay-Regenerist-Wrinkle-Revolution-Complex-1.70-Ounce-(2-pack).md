      <li>I love this lotion, don&#x27;t fill oily , dry really fast on the skin and fills like velvet.</li>
      <li>Really works.  </li>

      <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>This product goes on nicely, makes the skin feel good for a time, but I have now begun using the second container and had really hoped it might have had some measurable and visible impact on the wrinkles I am trying to combat, but unfortunately, I find absolutely no indication of that.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>One thing I&#x27;ve learned...use enough on your target areas to keep the skin &amp;#34;feeling tacky;&amp;#34; it will absorb within ten minutes and create a more obvious result.</li>
      <li>Words cannot describe how much I love the way this complex works for me.</li>
      <li>Bad container, product was good , Ive used Olay products since I was 16,I&#x27;m 71 and still using</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I LOVE this product by Olay!  I had been using it for over a year until Costco discontinued it so I turned to Amazon to look for it.  I&#x27;m 42 (to date) and I have no wrinkles and get compliments n my NON-MAKE-UPED face all the time!  I can&#x27;t live without it!  I&#x27;ll be using this product until the day I die!</li>
    <li> This product goes on nicely, makes the skin feel good for a time, but I have now begun using the second container and had really hoped it might have had some measurable and visible impact on the wrinkles I am trying to combat, but unfortunately, I find absolutely no indication of that.  I will probably move on to something else when this is gone.</li>
    <li> Bad container, product was good , Ive used Olay products since I was 16,I&#x27;m 71 and still using</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever!  Diminishes fine lines and darker skin imperfections completely, makes your skin soft without being oily and doesn&#x27;t make me break out, even with my very sensitive skin.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Most people think she&#x27;s around ten years younger than she is. Maybe it&#x27;s because she&#x27;s never smoked, done drugs and only drinks alcohol in moderation, and maybe it&#x27;s because she uses this stuff. She claims her youthful looks are a combination of genetics, sensible living AND taking care of her skin with products like Regenerist. There&#x27;s no way to know for sure, but I do know that she won&#x27;t ever allow herself to run out of Olay Regenerist, and that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
    <li> I love this face lotion. It is velvety smooth. It goes on best if you dip your fingers in a little bit of water first to help emulsify the cream. It doesn&#x27;t leave me skin feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I like how it works and how it feels on your face only need to use it once a day</li>
    <li> I am ranking the seller.  Price, packaging and delivery was good.  The item was as described.  I have only used the product for a couple of weeks.  White it moisturizes, I can not tell a difference in wrinkles..</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd time purchasing this product on the past 6 months and I am very happy about it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Have used it a couple of years now.  It makes my skin smooth and is not greasy at all.  Liquid make up applies more evenly when I use this moisturizer as well.</li>
    <li> I love Olay.  This product is the best of all. Really works.  I use it all the time and nothing else. My skin looks amazing..</li>
    <li> I ordered this after spending a lot on a well known cosmetics company&#x27;s product. I thought, they can&#x27;t be all that different.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line ~ they&#x27;re not. this is great.</li>
    <li> Great product! for a great price!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I wear it everyday and have for years. I recommend it for anyone looking for a good primer. It really helps any makeup go on smoothly.</li>
    <li> it goes on without being sticky. It makes my face feel clean and smooth.  I like it over other products I have used.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this. Love Olay.</li>
    <li> The product itself was not impressive after one week of using it twice daily. No difference that I could see. Of course, it could be that I can&#x27;t get any of it out of the container one out of 3 times! It is a pump dispenser and you pump and pump and usually it will finally squirt some out but other times you can pump for 35-40 times and nothing! Not impressed with the Revolution Complex nor the container. I recommend looking for something that comes in a jar instead of a cheap pump container...waste of product and money.</li>
    <li> I love this cream/lotion. I have very sensitive skin &amp; I have had no problems with this product. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the Olay Regenerist line but this one is greasy feeling and makes my skin break out. I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Words cannot describe how much I love the way this complex works for me. Fabulous</li>
    <li> Love this product; have used it for four years and found it to help reduce facials lines.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30s and am beginning to see fine lines around my eyes. Although I believe in aging gracefully I do not believe in aging stupidly. I&#x27;ve tried many products ranging in price and perceived quality, but have been disappointed 70 percent of the time. I received a miniscule trial tube of this product in a moisturizer pack and was shocked at the efficiency of the velvety mixture (somewhere in texture between a serum and a cream).

    <li> Great price on a 2 pack! My favorite Olay face product! Quick delivery. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, don&#x27;t fill oily , dry really fast on the skin and fills like velvet. someone ask If I have plastic surgery because my skin look so good.&lt;br /&gt;the price it&#x27;s amazing. I will order more next month to take to my mom</li>
