    <li> I am not a fan of this product. I have very dry skin and was hoping this would help with that. I noticed no improvement and even an increase in dryness.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin that often flakes, which led me to this product. It&#x27;s very creamy, smells nice, hydrating, and does not tighten the skin dramatically. I like 2 layers of it because it&#x27;s not to heavy(It&#x27;s thin) but I would like to see the product show. The flakiness of my skin has toned down a lot, maybe because I use the masque 4 times a week. This masque also has a blend of Chamomile and Sage extract, which really calmed my skin from irritation. Just give it a TRY</li>
    <li> I have used Queen Helene for decades, and as I&#x27;ve aged my skin has dried. My whole life I used the Mint Julep, so thought I would take the Olive Oil for a spin.&lt;br /&gt;Ugh, it&#x27;s fantastic!!! My skin felt so soft after, no greasiness, no break outs. This is now a once-a-week habit for me. I truly love this masque.</li>
    <li> * Queen Helene Olive Oil Masque: Surprised on how good the scent was and the texture of the product&lt;br /&gt;* I am glad I tried it as it did sooth, soften and hydrate my skin&lt;br /&gt;* A great find for the price!</li>
    <li> left my face nice and soft - I have oily skin so will only use 1 or 2x a month</li>
    <li> Great masque.  My skin feels wonderful after I apply and remove this masque.  It is very hydrating.</li>
    <li> Product was what I expected. Did not dry my face out, and did not irritate my sensitive skin so worked out fine.</li>
    <li> This is a low quality product, full of ingredients that I am not excited about putting on my face. Like fragrance, mineral oil, parabens. This is not my first moisturizing masque, but this one does the worst job.  I never paid more than $15 for a masque. Do your face a favor, add few dollars more and buy a better product.</li>
    <li> I have really dry skin and this stuff is awesome. Makes me feel like a queen after using. Would recommend for dry skin. Soothing!</li>
    <li> very clean refreshing facial mask with olive oil scent.&lt;br /&gt;i used it for 3 months and still have some left. great convenient value product</li>
    <li> I have always enjoyed Queen Helene products, in fact, they are my most purchased skincare/hygiene products and also my most used. By the way, I&#x27;m a guy and I&#x27;m saying this. I suffer from mild acne on my face, and after using my other products to heal this acne, it can leave my face quite dry; well I can say goodbye to that irritating feeling now! I simply apply this miracle cream (which also smells excellent, does not smell like olive oil at all) as directed, and after I wash it off, my face feels as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bum! (minus the acne)</li>
    <li> I love this product never had any problem with it i brought it 3 times i think those who are having problem must have sensitive skin your skin is at its drys in the morning when you get up thats when i put it on leave on for about 30 mins wash off then face  cream and make up for the day my face feels moisturize for the hole day works well for me believe it or not i have know wrinkles and im 58yrs</li>
