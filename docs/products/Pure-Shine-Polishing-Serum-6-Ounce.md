      <li>Its a great product!</li>
      <li>Great product, well packaged for shipping and received on time!  </li>
      <li>I have been looking in stores everywhere around here and was so happy to find it on amazon!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also tried Phyto&#x27;s Phytolisse Ultra Shine Smoothing Serum which is actually really good, but it also costs $30 for 1.7 oz!</li>
      <li>Still giving it 3 stars because it does a great job of smoothing out my frazzled hair.</li>
      <li>I do like Ojon&#x27;s shine mist, GREAT smell, but noticed that you do have to reapply to keep the shine.</li>
      <li>Great product, really happy with it.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a lot, at a really great price.</li>
      <li>this serum is something that I can&#x27;t think I can ever give up - after trying to find something good that fits my budget</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read a lot of labels, I&#x27;m even surprising myself with my serum expertise.    </li>
      <li>And it incorporates macadamia oil which I really loved about the Carol&#x27;s Daughter recipe.  </li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this serum!</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
      <li>The serum works so well at taming the chaos and leaves me with perfect curls and incredibly soft, shiny hair.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>but it straightens my hair better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>U can get this item at walmart.com for $4.50 love this item</li>
      <li>Seems to work ok.</li>
      <li>Most of the color came out</li>
      <li>and I just love the results.  </li>
      <li>LOVE it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve tried others not mentioned</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also so cheap, thank god I&#x27;ve found this!</li>
      <li>I have natural curly hair and this product works great.  </li>
      <li>, it has aloe extract and grapeseed oil which is great for the hair AND even has silk amino acid which is great because hardly any shine serums have silk or hydrolyzed silk.  </li>
      <li>but my hair was lifeless, super-dry, like straw, and easily tangled.  </li>
      <li>, they&#x27;re too strong and just not my thing.     </li>
      <li>Beware of Smooth &#x27;N Shine which is greasy.</li>
      <li>If I use this in the morning the rest of the day my hair will stay in the style I styled it with the product plus it will remain silky smooth for the rest of the day until I wash it out.</li>
      <li>Wish it was still available as a spray.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve done a fair amount of experimenting with products because I have naturally spiral curls</li>
      <li>Hope you love it as much as I do!</li>
      <li>I am really excited about this product, and I think I&#x27;ll never go without a hair serum.   </li>
      <li>It works great for my hair and has no alcohol to dry the ends!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried Carol&#x27;s Daughter shine serum, and liked it, which is a macadamia oil based product, very light weight with a great smell, but I noticed that the smell changed after a day to something sort of weird.</li>
      <li>the end of the day, its cheap and worth a try</li>
      <li>Good product and low price.</li>
      <li>I liked that it&#x27;s natural</li>
      <li>but I also wanted a serum that contained the two main ingredients in most shine serums: Cyclomethicone and Dimethiconol.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t remember the name, but I remember it had a lovely smell and made my hair feel tantalizingly soft.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair so soft and silky smooth!</li>
      <li>I ended my search with this product - good bye wire hair that all other products that I tryed to reduce the frizz did.</li>
      <li>right?</li>
      <li>My curls are pretty well defined.</li>
      <li>I am trying CVS before resorting to Amazon&#x27;s higher price.</li>
      <li>You can get it at Duane Reade and most local Walgreens types of places.    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love and will definitely continue using it!</li>
      <li>When I air-dry my hair and just use this product, it does absolutely nothing for my hair.  </li>
      <li>I use it with suddenly straight.</li>
      <li>I really missed the hair serum I used as a child that was by redken.</li>
      <li>but I use it as a stand alone because I really dont have time (or the interest) for all that.</li>
      <li>And at $28 for like 2oz, it goes way too fast.    </li>
      <li>but...now lets get to PureShine Polishing Serum:    What I love about this product is that besides the first two main ingredients, Cyclomethicone and Dimethiconol every other ingredient is quality and well chosen.  </li>
      <li>I have dry, wavy, fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I washed my hair and mixed this serum with regular conditioners (John Frieda, or Pantene, or even Suave) to spread out the serum more evenly throughout the hair.  </li>
      <li>It is a newer version of my old bottle formula from the Pure Shine company.  </li>
      <li>My hair is incredibly soft to the touch, and my frizziness due to many new hairs growing in is minimized.</li>
      <li>My hair shined again and was much softer, and had become a little darker as the hair shafts filled with this serum.  </li>
      <li>I had a little bit of this in an old bottle and was able to comb my hair.  </li>
      <li>I was almost out, so I wanted to buy a new bottle.</li>
      <li>that it&#x27;s subtle because I use Aveda shampoo and conditioners and if you&#x27;ve ever used Aveda, their products smell AMAZING, so</li>
      <li>It is still super dry and not shiny at all.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s hard to find something that doesn&#x27;t sit heavily on top of it.</li>
      <li>this allows me to leave it natural and manageable.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my hear feeling soft and without any frizz.  </li>
      <li>and contains some natural form of alcohol as well.  </li>
      <li>However, if I use this product and then blow-dry my almost-dry hair, and then use a straightener, my hair is soft.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to love this product because of the great reviews and chemical-free ingredients (as other reviewers have attested to), but it&#x27;s a fail, at least for my hair type.</li>
      <li>I did this for the next 3 normally scheduled hair washings.  </li>
      <li>I have a lot of hair and it is very curly and dry.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how it would be for straighter already silky hair, I think it would just make the hair heavy and too oily for someone with Caucasian type hair, but if you have hair more on the dry curly side, and you want your hair straighter, silkier and softer, this is definitely for you!</li>
      <li>Okay, and to top it all off, it has a subtle, almost barely noticeable fragrance that smells very natural, faintly like a cross between a honeydew melon and a flower.  </li>
      <li>But not amazingly silky super soft as I would like it to be.  </li>

<li> and I&#x27;m always trying to keep them soft and shiny due to the fact that my hair make-up tends to be course, porous, dry and frizzy, just comes with the territory.    </li>
<li> I would definitely would recommend this to people with curly or dry hair.</li>
<li> It has NO ALCOHOL, which is key, so it won&#x27;t dry the hair</li>
<li> I have curly hair and of course tends to be dry with a lot of frizz especially in humid days.</li>
<li> I wash my hair with only conditioner (I use shampoo only once every other week)</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time and would recommend it to anyone with frizz problems.</li>
<li> I have read other reviews in which people have said that this was just a finishing product, the last step in a long process of hair additives</li>
<li> It has no alcohol in it, which can dry out your hair.  </li>
<li> I put this on the ends of my hair, then spray on their laminator, then blow dry.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t want to put some other perfumy, fruity artificial scent on top of all that goodness.  </li>
<li> I am an artificial blonde with naturally curly hair, so its a double whammy when it  comes to dry and frizzy hair.</li>
<li> I wash my hair twice a week - the rest of the days I just wet the hair and run my fingers few times thru hair and looks perfect - too bad that I don&#x27;t see it often in the grocery stores as before, I&#x27;m afraid that it will be discontinued.</li>
<li> all the time- usually jsut in the winter or whenever I&#x27;ve been using a lot of heat on it recently.</li>
<li> but I had a feeling this product was getting overlooked due the the fact that it&#x27;s not one of the well-known producers out there like Garnier Fructis, Loreal, Chi, BioSilk, Bumble and Bumble, Bed Head, Paul Mitchell</li>
<li> I left that conditioner and serum packed onto my hair for at least an hour under a plastic hair cap.  </li>
<li> I had the dark dye stripped out of my hair 3 times in a row in 6 hours at the hair stylists.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m Black and my hair is kinda curly</li>
<li> , I use a little curl cream or leave-in conditioners</li>
<li> This product helps tame flyaways and unruly hair.</li>

    <li> I have dry, wavy, fine hair.  When I air-dry my hair and just use this product, it does absolutely nothing for my hair.  It is still super dry and not shiny at all.  However, if I use this product and then blow-dry my almost-dry hair, and then use a straightener, my hair is soft.  But not amazingly silky super soft as I would like it to be.

    <li> I love this stuff. Wish it was still available as a spray.</li>
    <li> I really missed the hair serum I used as a child that was by redken. It was in a blue bottle- I don&#x27;t remember the name, but I remember it had a lovely smell and made my hair feel tantalizingly soft. This product was sitting on the shelf at my local store and caught my eye. I smelled it and tried a dab on my hair and I was instantly wowed! It does the same thing as that redken product of my youth, for about a third of the cost. I bought some and immediately went home to wash my hair and use some of this product to see what would happen.  My hair is incredibly soft to the touch, and my frizziness due to many new hairs growing in is minimized. I look sleek and put together, and my hair smells awesome. I am really excited about this product, and I think I&#x27;ll never go without a hair serum.   final thought:  LOVE it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I am an artificial blonde with naturally curly hair, so its a double whammy when it  comes to dry and frizzy hair. The serum works so well at taming the chaos and leaves me with perfect curls and incredibly soft, shiny hair. I have read other reviews in which people have said that this was just a finishing product, the last step in a long process of hair additives but I use it as a stand alone because I really dont have time (or the interest) for all that. It lasts for a couple of days, depending on your activities . Its a great product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews often but I had a feeling this product was getting overlooked due the the fact that it&#x27;s not one of the well-known producers out there like Garnier Fructis, Loreal, Chi, BioSilk, Bumble and Bumble, Bed Head, Paul Mitchell, well, you get my point. They spend a lot of money on marketing, commercials and hence people try their product in droves.    I&#x27;ve done a fair amount of experimenting with products because I have naturally spiral curls and I&#x27;m always trying to keep them soft and shiny due to the fact that my hair make-up tends to be course, porous, dry and frizzy, just comes with the territory.    I&#x27;ve tried Carol&#x27;s Daughter shine serum, and liked it, which is a macadamia oil based product, very light weight with a great smell, but I noticed that the smell changed after a day to something sort of weird. I liked that it&#x27;s natural but I also wanted a serum that contained the two main ingredients in most shine serums: Cyclomethicone and Dimethiconol.  Those are the key players in any serum and Carol&#x27;s Daughter doesn&#x27;t have them included.    I&#x27;ve also tried Phyto&#x27;s Phytolisse Ultra Shine Smoothing Serum which is actually really good, but it also costs $30 for 1.7 oz! and contains some natural form of alcohol as well.  That&#x27;s why I kept searching.        I do like Ojon&#x27;s shine mist, GREAT smell, but noticed that you do have to reapply to keep the shine. And at $28 for like 2oz, it goes way too fast.    I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve tried others not mentioned but...now lets get to PureShine Polishing Serum:    What I love about this product is that besides the first two main ingredients, Cyclomethicone and Dimethiconol every other ingredient is quality and well chosen.  And it incorporates macadamia oil which I really loved about the Carol&#x27;s Daughter recipe.  It has NO ALCOHOL, which is key, so it won&#x27;t dry the hair, it has aloe extract and grapeseed oil which is great for the hair AND even has silk amino acid which is great because hardly any shine serums have silk or hydrolyzed silk.  I mean some do, like Biosilk and a few others, but they&#x27;re pricey and usually have alcohol in them as does Biosilk.  I&#x27;ve read a lot of labels, I&#x27;m even surprising myself with my serum expertise.    Okay, and to top it all off, it has a subtle, almost barely noticeable fragrance that smells very natural, faintly like a cross between a honeydew melon and a flower.  It&#x27;s awesome. I like that it&#x27;s subtle because I use Aveda shampoo and conditioners and if you&#x27;ve ever used Aveda, their products smell AMAZING, so I don&#x27;t want to put some other perfumy, fruity artificial scent on top of all that goodness.  Plus I don&#x27;t like artificial fragrances, they&#x27;re too strong and just not my thing.     Lastly, you get a helluva lot of product for you buck, 6 fluid ounces.  That&#x27;s a lot, at a really great price. This bottle should last me a while.    You can get it at Duane Reade and most local Walgreens types of places.    Great product, really happy with it.  Hope you love it as much as I do!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this serum! It is the best thing for my hair I&#x27;ve found in years! I use it to curl or straighten my hair. It&#x27;s like a heat protector. It makes my hair so soft and silky smooth! If I use this in the morning the rest of the day my hair will stay in the style I styled it with the product plus it will remain silky smooth for the rest of the day until I wash it out. I&#x27;m Black and my hair is kinda curly but it straightens my hair better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used. Did I mention it helps straighten the hair too. I&#x27;m in love and will definitely continue using it! It&#x27;s also so cheap, thank god I&#x27;ve found this! I would definitely would recommend this to people with curly or dry hair. I don&#x27;t know how it would be for straighter already silky hair, I think it would just make the hair heavy and too oily for someone with Caucasian type hair, but if you have hair more on the dry curly side, and you want your hair straighter, silkier and softer, this is definitely for you!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have been using this product for years. It leaves my hair shiny and smooth. It is not greasy and protects hair from thermal damage.</li>
    <li> Great product, well packaged for shipping and received on time!  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
    <li> Please keep offering this product.</li>
    <li> U can get this item at walmart.com for $4.50 love this item</li>
    <li> I have natural curly hair and this product works great.  I wash my hair with only conditioner (I use shampoo only once every other week), I use a little curl cream or leave-in conditioners then I apply this polishing serum, scrunching from the bottom up. do not apply to your roots or scalp. Defuse with a blowdryer. If you have curly hair, you know that every girl&#x27;s curly hair is different, but this worked for mine. My curls are pretty well defined. They get a little frizzy, but not too bad. If your curls get frizzy or need help being defined, you may need a curl-enhancing or frizz-reducing product also. The serum would be the last step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, its cheap and worth a try right? I used to buy at Walgreens for $6-7 but it appears they do not carry it anymore. I am trying CVS before resorting to Amazon&#x27;s higher price.</li>
    <li> this serum is something that I can&#x27;t think I can ever give up - after trying to find something good that fits my budget I ended my search with this product - good bye wire hair that all other products that I tryed to reduce the frizz did. I have curly hair and of course tends to be dry with a lot of frizz especially in humid days. I wash my hair twice a week - the rest of the days I just wet the hair and run my fingers few times thru hair and looks perfect - too bad that I don&#x27;t see it often in the grocery stores as before, I&#x27;m afraid that it will be discontinued.</li>
    <li> I have been looking in stores everywhere around here and was so happy to find it on amazon! It works great for my hair and has no alcohol to dry the ends! I recommend it to everyone .</li>
    <li> I was almost out, so I wanted to buy a new bottle. I guess they have changed their formula or fragrance, because it used to smell like coconuts, but this smells gross. Still giving it 3 stars because it does a great job of smoothing out my frazzled hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the type who has frizzy hair all the time- usually jsut in the winter or whenever I&#x27;ve been using a lot of heat on it recently. But, whenever I do get that bit of frizz going on with it, this stops it in its tracks. I have wavy, thick hair and it&#x27;s hard to find something that doesn&#x27;t sit heavily on top of it. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time and would recommend it to anyone with frizz problems.</li>
    <li> I have problem hair that I need to blow out after I wash it. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products over the years, and this is the BEST. It has no alcohol in it, which can dry out your hair.  It&#x27;s made from placenta, so it&#x27;s all natural.  I sweat by all their products. I put this on the ends of my hair, then spray on their laminator, then blow dry.  Try it. It works!</li>
    <li> I had the dark dye stripped out of my hair 3 times in a row in 6 hours at the hair stylists.  Most of the color came out but my hair was lifeless, super-dry, like straw, and easily tangled.  I tried a conditioner that changed it into steel-wool-like and unable to get a comb through.  I had a little bit of this in an old bottle and was able to comb my hair.  I searched for this on the internet. It is a newer version of my old bottle formula from the Pure Shine company.  I washed my hair and mixed this serum with regular conditioners (John Frieda, or Pantene, or even Suave) to spread out the serum more evenly throughout the hair.  I left that conditioner and serum packed onto my hair for at least an hour under a plastic hair cap.  Then I rinsed it out thoroughly.  Immediately my hair began to become softer and rejuvenate.  I did this for the next 3 normally scheduled hair washings.  My hair shined again and was much softer, and had become a little darker as the hair shafts filled with this serum.  Beware of Smooth &#x27;N Shine which is greasy.</li>
    <li> This product helps tame flyaways and unruly hair. Good product and low price.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it is similar to shine serum. It works just as well and I just love the results.  It leaves my hear feeling soft and without any frizz.  I use it with suddenly straight. I have a lot of hair and it is very curly and dry.  this allows me to leave it natural and manageable.  I would recommend this to any hair type.  If you have oily hair use very little.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to help with frizz. Seems to work ok. Will continue to look for something else.</li>
