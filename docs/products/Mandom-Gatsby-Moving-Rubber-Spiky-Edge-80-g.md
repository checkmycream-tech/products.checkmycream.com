### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>PERFECT.</li>
      <li>and this two are the best.</li>
      <li>For best results,   1st.</li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome!  </li>
      <li>Its been working awesomely for me.</li>
      <li>This is the best shiz I&#x27;ve ever put in my hair!  </li>
      <li>If you have curly hair, straightening is best before use.     </li>
      <li>It is a very good product as well,</li>
      <li>Very good quality wax.</li>
      <li>So I need wax for texture, and anything that helps  with volume and body is a welcome</li>
      <li>This stuff works great for spiking and styling for an all day spiky look.  </li>
      <li>It smells great, holds great, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair spread out like a gel.</li>
      <li>this stuff is great.  </li>
      <li>Anyways of course everyone has their own style of hair, but for the very best results have your hair thinned and layered.</li>
      <li>It has the best hold of any product I have ever tried (and I have tried many from the 6yrs of writing this update) and still none compare to this one.  </li>
      <li>this a good product, smells great too</li>
      <li>All in all, Good stuff.</li>
      <li>everything is good about this product</li>
      <li>Smells good, good texture, good quality and price.    </li>
      <li>Very pleased.</li>
      <li>I really love Gatsby Moving Rubber - Spiky Edge!  </li>
      <li>I liked the smell of this product.</li>
      <li>This moving rubber by Gatsby is so effective</li>
      <li>Straight hair works the best.  </li>
      <li>BTW, if anyone still uses Axe Hair Wax, I suggest to switch to this, because it smells nice, styles better, and its a better brand. :p    </li>
      <li>and  this is by far the best and a fraction of the cost!</li>
      <li>This is by far the best hair product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>but this stuff is much more effective.  </li>
      <li>[[VIDEOID:mo29ZDEIXN6E4QO]]This is honestly the best hair styling product for Asian hair that I&#x27;ve ever used to date.  </li>
      <li>I decided to make the move to waxes, and again as I said above, this is probably the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I also like how you can re-style your hair throughout the day without water or adding more product.  </li>
      <li>(of course most of them with a bit of spikes).</li>
      <li>This is the best Hair wax if you have short hair.</li>
      <li>,that looks like a dandruff&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>On top of that, it would make my hair look wet/shiny all day and leave flakes</li>
      <li>i complement it with the Mandom Gatsby Moving Rubber Spiky Edge for more hold and a bit of shin.</li>
      <li>Need short hair for this for best results.</li>
      <li>This is definitely one of the best hair waxes that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>It makes the perfect spikes and won&#x27;t leave your hair looking greasy or wet.</li>
      <li>but I know it works great with short hair.</li>
      <li>it will hold for the day cool.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re looking for a good hair wax, and have short hair, I heartily recommend Gatsby&#x27;s Moving Rubber: Spiky Edge.</li>
      <li>This is just the most versatile for me and really does everything I need it to do.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine, short hair, and this is hands down the best product that I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>love this brand,i have tried most of different brands of gel..</li>
      <li>I received product very fast as well!  </li>
      <li>i like this good quality ship very fast and it is same as introduced</li>
      <li>I can not say enough good things about Spiky Edge, I highly recommend it!!</li>
      <li>My hair is almost straight and the results are fine.</li>
      <li>All very good quality and you can actually wash all these out of your hair unlike Paul Mitchell&#x27;s dry wax.</li>
      <li>Also one last thing, if you live in Korea Town, L.A., then I suggest you get the Gatsby Moving Rubber from a good Korean Mart.</li>
      <li>This stuff lets you style your hair in amazing ways, and will hold for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need very much to make it work either.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used moose, gel, hair sprays, pomades, and more quality products such as Sumo Tech</li>
      <li>Shipping was extremely fast, did not expect it to arrive so soon!    </li>
      <li>I definately will be buying more of Mandom Gatsby products in the future.</li>
      <li>If you want a more asian hairstyle, this product will do the trick for you.</li>
      <li>The reason why this isn&#x27;t a 5 is because it smells like red wine and but other than that great product.</li>
      <li>but I guess I don&#x27;t need to because this stuff works really well.</li>
      <li>i highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cut in a modern asymmetrical layered style.  </li>
      <li>arrived fast from Amazon, in under a week.  </li>
      <li>I went to somewhere called the Galleria, or something like that, and i ended up buying the whole Moving Rubber Series. ^_^</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have naturally straight hair, you can use a straightener.</li>
      <li>This product works really well.</li>
      <li>I use it for a kind of messy bed head</li>
      <li>I have used many products(expensive gels, axe spiky hair care wax, got2bglued, expensive hairsprays) and I have to be honest and say that none of them compare to what Moving Rubber has done.   </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used many other hair products</li>
      <li>the other Gatsby&#x27;s have more shine to them, e.g. Nuance Motion, Air Rise, etc.)  </li>
      <li>If your hair is particularly curly like mine, you&#x27;ll need to straighten it of course, but from what I gather it&#x27;s preferable to straighten it even if it&#x27;s naturally straight.</li>
      <li>First, I have gone through many different hairstyles (I&#x27;m half asian) and all have varied in length from super long to the current trim and neat hairstyles that are popular today.  </li>
      <li>It is kind of hard to get out of your hair, but just wash it &#x3D;</li>
      <li>You can see from my video that it did a nice job of styling short Asian hair, especially on the sides.</li>
      <li>I recommend using on dry hair, the less water the better!  </li>
      <li>But, WOW - this prdoct works!</li>
      <li>Damp -  Cool Wet.</li>
      <li>This is Better than all the products i used before I $25 in some other product, same as other nothing special.</li>
      <li>This product will work as long as you use it right.  </li>
      <li>FIRST OF ALL, for all those thinking is this really going to work differently than other products I can get, it really does work.  </li>
      <li>Moving Rubber Wild Shake.</li>
      <li>I also bought the Gatsby Wild Shake, and I use that one when my hair grows to Medium length.</li>
      <li>If you want complete control as well as protection, use a heat protection spray(Tresemme) and hairspray after you wash your hair, then straighten it, then apply the Moving Rubber.   </li>
      <li>This lets you do pretty much anything with your hair, short or long.   </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have asian, hispanic, or just naturally straight hair, don&#x27;t even try this.  </li>
      <li>None of them felt like they completely washed  Moving Rubber from my hair.</li>
      <li>You can use it with thick hair but it is much more effective with thin or thinned out hair.   </li>
      <li>I have short, very fine, very thin hair, which is straight.  </li>
      <li>Anime / Spiky / Long Spiky - Spiky Edge, Wild Shake, Grunge Mat.   </li>

<li> Aside from just lasting me so long, the product does what I need it to do.  </li>
<li> I ordered two of these, as it was only a bit more expensive than buying just one due to the international shipping charges.</li>
<li> Is it possible to have the asian hairstyle using other products?</li>
<li> I previously experimented with various gels and glues, only to find that (due to my thin, fine hair) it would make the hair stick in strands and make me look like I was balding.</li>
<li> Wow can&#x27;t believe after all these years, I&#x27;m coming back to edit this review and let everyone know how this product has been with me for the past couple of years.  </li>
<li> Like a lot of people said, it holds your hair all day long, and you can still shift it throughout the day.</li>
<li> When my hair is dry</li>
<li> It is also less expensive than many other products out there.    </li>
<li> I have stayed with the pink one for this entire time and have used all of the other ones.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is Better than all the products i used before I $25 in some other product, same as other nothing special. But whit this Product you can reshape you hair it will hold for the day cool.</li>
    <li> This is the best shiz I&#x27;ve ever put in my hair!  It makes the perfect spikes and won&#x27;t leave your hair looking greasy or wet.</li>
    <li> I really love Gatsby Moving Rubber - Spiky Edge!  This stuff works great for spiking and styling for an all day spiky look.  I recommend using on dry hair, the less water the better!  I received product very fast as well!  Can&#x27;t get anything like this at your local store.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, short hair, and this is hands down the best product that I have ever used.  It takes only a minute to use, and the style you make stays all day.    I also like how you can re-style your hair throughout the day without water or adding more product.  It is also less expensive than many other products out there.    I can not say enough good things about Spiky Edge, I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> This moving rubber by Gatsby is so effective, it lets you move your hair in any direction. Like a lot of people said, it holds your hair all day long, and you can still shift it throughout the day. The reason why this isn&#x27;t a 5 is because it smells like red wine and but other than that great product.</li>
    <li> this a good product, smells great too and i&#x27;ve received it under a week. i highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I just received my shipment of Mandom&#x27;s Gatsby Moving Rubber Spiky Edge. This is definitely one of the best hair waxes that I&#x27;ve ever used. I previously experimented with various gels and glues, only to find that (due to my thin, fine hair) it would make the hair stick in strands and make me look like I was balding. On top of that, it would make my hair look wet/shiny all day and leave flakes all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to make the move to waxes, and again as I said above, this is probably the best one I&#x27;ve ever used. It smells great, holds great, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair spread out like a gel. This stuff lets you style your hair in amazing ways, and will hold for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a good hair wax, and have short hair, I heartily recommend Gatsby&#x27;s Moving Rubber: Spiky Edge. A sidenote: I ordered two of these, as it was only a bit more expensive than buying just one due to the international shipping charges.</li>
    <li> Whats to say? this stuff is great.  I don&#x27;t know what hair lengths this works well with, but I know it works great with short hair.</li>
    <li> It came on time and I received what I wanted.  It is a very good product as well, PERFECT.</li>
    <li> When Kiwi quit making their water wax hair product years ago, I tried numerous products to try and duplicate it, with no luck. But, WOW - this prdoct works! It&#x27;s not greasy and keeps the lift in your hair all day.</li>
    <li> Need short hair for this for best results. Is like gel except the shine.&lt;br /&gt;Good product</li>
    <li> For the price this wax can&#x27;t be beat.  Very good quality wax. I have pretty thick and tough hair that is not very easy to shape.  This wax has no problem doing so. Smells good, good texture, good quality and price.    I also have Mandom Gatsby Technical Design Clay and Mandom Gatsby Moving Rubber Wild Shake. All very good quality and you can actually wash all these out of your hair unlike Paul Mitchell&#x27;s dry wax. If you can&#x27;t wash the wax out of your hair, that is not good.    Gatsby will be choice of hair products from now on.</li>
    <li> If you use gel and you don&#x27;t like how it shines and flakes, this is the stuff for you. If you tried wax and it wasn&#x27;t working for you, Gatsby Moving Rubber is easier to apply than wax.    Be warned though, you need your hair thinned and layered. If you have curly hair, straightening is best before use.     Watch some youtube videos about this product to see how to use it.</li>
    <li> The product came in the estimated delivery days.    I haven&#x27;t used many other hair products but I guess I don&#x27;t need to because this stuff works really well. If your hair is a bit longer you will need hair spray though.    I use it for a kind of messy bed head look.    All in all, Good stuff.</li>
    <li> After reading all the rave reviews here on Amazon,  I ordered Gatsby Moving Rubber Spiky Edge.  I have short, very fine, very thin hair, which is straight.  It&#x27;s cut in a modern asymmetrical layered style.  So I need wax for texture, and anything that helps  with volume and body is a welcome plus!  My GATSBY MOVING RUBBER SPIKY EDGE   arrived fast from Amazon, in under a week.  I applied a pea size amount to my finger tips   rubbed it between my fingers and then applied  from midway to the ends of my hair and twisted pieces to  texturize my doo. I didn&#x27;t get the \\&quot;bold-hold\\&quot; that  I see in the GATSBY MOVING RUBBER SPIKY EDGE videos, that I&#x27;ve  seen on-line, but that is probably b/c of my fine-thin hair texture.    I liked the smell of this product. I think it smells  a bit like green apples.     My chief complaint with GATSBY MOVING RUBBER  SPIKY EDGE, is the difficulty in washing it out of my hair.  I can shampoo 3 times in a row, yet I can still feel this  gunky sticky residue in my hair.  How do you guys wash this product out of your hair?  I tried shampooing it with:  Pantene Repair &amp; Protect Shampoo, Herbal Essence Body Essence Shampoo &amp; Suave Professionals Volumizing Shampoo.  None of them felt like they completely washed  Moving Rubber from my hair.</li>
    <li> love this brand,i have tried most of different brands of gel..but this one works perfectly.it doesnt create a white thing on your hair when it gets dry.look so nasty,that looks like a dandruff&#x3D;) but this one is awesome.i recommend this brand!!try it!!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair product I&#x27;ve used. If you have thick hair like me, you&#x27;ll need to get it thinned, and layered if you can (if you leave it thick, the spiky edge turns into a spiky porcupine). If your hair is particularly curly like mine, you&#x27;ll need to straighten it of course, but from what I gather it&#x27;s preferable to straighten it even if it&#x27;s naturally straight.</li>
    <li> I bought this wax and the Gatsby Hair Wax Mat Type together. I had purchase a lot of hair waxes in the last years and this two are the best. My hair is almost straight and the results are fine. You can make any hair style you desire (of course most of them with a bit of spikes). When my hair is dry i used the Gatsby Hair Wax Mat Type and at the end i complement it with the Mandom Gatsby Moving Rubber Spiky Edge for more hold and a bit of shin. Definitely a buy u wont regret!</li>
    <li> This is the best Hair wax if you have short hair. I also bought the Gatsby Wild Shake, and I use that one when my hair grows to Medium length. Anyways of course everyone has their own style of hair, but for the very best results have your hair thinned and layered. BTW, if anyone still uses Axe Hair Wax, I suggest to switch to this, because it smells nice, styles better, and its a better brand. :p    Also one last thing, if you live in Korea Town, L.A., then I suggest you get the Gatsby Moving Rubber from a good Korean Mart. I went to somewhere called the Galleria, or something like that, and i ended up buying the whole Moving Rubber Series. ^_^</li>
    <li> UPDATE 7/2015  Wow can&#x27;t believe after all these years, I&#x27;m coming back to edit this review and let everyone know how this product has been with me for the past couple of years.  First, I have gone through many different hairstyles (I&#x27;m half asian) and all have varied in length from super long to the current trim and neat hairstyles that are popular today.  The one thing that has remained the same is this product.  I have used for every single hairstyle from my initial purchase back in 2009 to the current year.  Aside from just lasting me so long, the product does what I need it to do.  Hold my hair for the style I want for the entire day.  This product will work as long as you use it right.  It has the best hold of any product I have ever tried (and I have tried many from the 6yrs of writing this update) and still none compare to this one.  I have stayed with the pink one for this entire time and have used all of the other ones.  This is just the most versatile for me and really does everything I need it to do.  Stop reading, just buy it.    FIRST OF ALL, for all those thinking is this really going to work differently than other products I can get, it really does work.  I have used many products(expensive gels, axe spiky hair care wax, got2bglued, expensive hairsprays) and I have to be honest and say that none of them compare to what Moving Rubber has done.   If you want a more asian hairstyle, this product will do the trick for you. Is it possible to have the asian hairstyle using other products? Yes you can but this stuff is much more effective.  It does not make your hair get hard or anything and doesn&#x27;t make it have a shiny effect like gel does.(Although the other Gatsby&#x27;s have more shine to them, e.g. Nuance Motion, Air Rise, etc.)  This lets you do pretty much anything with your hair, short or long.   For best results,   1st. Thin out your hair.  You can use it with thick hair but it is much more effective with thin or thinned out hair.   2nd. Straight hair works the best.  If you don&#x27;t have naturally straight hair, you can use a straightener. If you don&#x27;t have asian, hispanic, or just naturally straight hair, don&#x27;t even try this.  If you have African/American hair, this product may have a harder time doing what you want.  Definitely give it a try.   3rd.  If you want complete control as well as protection, use a heat protection spray(Tresemme) and hairspray after you wash your hair, then straighten it, then apply the Moving Rubber.   Which Gatsby to buy?   Anime / Spiky / Long Spiky - Spiky Edge, Wild Shake, Grunge Mat.   Calmer Asian Hairstyle short/long - Air Rise, Loose Shuffle.   Shiny Damp -  Cool Wet.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for (&gt;.&lt;)  I can finally do things to it I have never done before...  Shipping was extremely fast, did not expect it to arrive so soon!    It is kind of hard to get out of your hair, but just wash it &#x3D;p</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo29ZDEIXN6E4QO]]This is honestly the best hair styling product for Asian hair that I&#x27;ve ever used to date.  You can see from my video that it did a nice job of styling short Asian hair, especially on the sides.</li>
    <li> This product works really well. I just straightened my hair and I had just gotten this in. It does work with African American hair, I think you just have to relax or straighten or so before use. Its been working awesomely for me. I definately will be buying more of Mandom Gatsby products in the future. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> i like this good quality ship very fast and it is same as introduced everything is good about this product</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!  You don&#x27;t need very much to make it work either.  Granted, if your hair is thick like mine you probably want to thin it out by using thinning shears (or have your barber thin our your hair if you&#x27;re not comfortable doing it yourself).  It has different effects when you use it wet or dry---I personally like to use it dry to give that natural look (like you didn&#x27;t put globs on gel on your head).  I&#x27;ve used moose, gel, hair sprays, pomades, and more quality products such as Sumo Tech and  this is by far the best and a fraction of the cost!</li>
