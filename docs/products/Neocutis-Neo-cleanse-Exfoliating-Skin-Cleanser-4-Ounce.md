<li> I expected this product to have scrubbing granules.</li>
<li> I am adding products gradually and they complement each other extremely well.</li>
<li> Decided to try NeoCutis cleanser when I switched to other NeoCutis products.</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;have tried other Neocutis products.&lt;br</li>
<li> Very few breakouts and pores seem smaller!</li>
<li> It only takes a little pea size to do your face, so don&#x27;t waste it!  </li>
<li> It can burn a little if your skin is not use to it</li>
<li> When I think of exfoliating I think of little scrubbing balls.</li>
<li> but that subsides after a few treatments.  </li>
<li> and I do not have trouble with the pores filling up</li>
<li> A FEW MONTHS AGO</li>
<li> I Kept it anyway since it was the plain cleanser.  </li>
<li> Much better than using stuff with  microbeads which are terrible for the environment !!!  </li>
<li> You put a small amount in your hand, moisten it and rub it in circles into the skin.</li>
<li> Cleared up my small bouts of acne.  </li>
<li> I will continue to use this, but for the price I&#x27;m not sure I will buy again.</li>
<li> Too late to return it, so I&#x27;ll give it a try as a once-weekly product.  </li>
<li> no more!  </li>
<li> You simply can&#x27;t go wrong with this brand.</li>
<li> so it was just selecting the wrong product to ship.</li>
<li> Expensive.</li>
<li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>

    <li> Feels tingly. Leaves skin cleannnnnnnnnn</li>
    <li> Great product that I have used since last year.  It is very gentle on the skin and does an excellent job of gentle exfoliation without being harsh or abrasive.  My skin feels smooth and silky afterward.  I have acne rosacea and would highly recommend this product to anyone with hypersensitive, red toned skin.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this by my anesthetist.  It was sold in the spa for twice the amount here on amazon so I am great to have looked around before purchasing it first.&lt;br /&gt;It is very mild for the skin and leaves a clean feeling.  My face is much clearer and feels a lot cleaner when using this product.  I recommend this to anyone who has mild acne and who has sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I STILL LOVE THIS PRODUCT BUT IT HAS GONE UP SEVEN DOLLARS SINCE I LAST PURCHASED IT A FEW MONTHS AGO</li>
    <li> Can dry out skin, becareful if your sensitive.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it that often but it seems to be pretty good.  Guess I have to give it more time.</li>

    <li> thecleanser I ordered was incorrect .  I Kept it anyway since it was the plain cleanser.  If this happens again I will return it for the exfoliating cleanser.  so it was just selecting the wrong product to ship.</li>
    <li> Our dermatologist recommended this product and it works perfectly in removing blackheads. We were so pleased to find that Amazon carries this product line. It has also made my skin softer and has shrunk my pores. It is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I expected this product to have scrubbing granules. it does not. You put a small amount in your hand, moisten it and rub it in circles into the skin. Seems to do the job of exfoliating.</li>

    <li> Love this product!  Makes your skin soft and tightens it up!  I first bought it from a Spa where I had some facial treatments and loved it.

    <li> I have been using this product for years now . My doctor of 13 years whom I highly trust recommended. Great product</li>
    <li> My wife uses this cleanser on a daily basis. The Dermatologist sells it for $36 so Amazon&#x27;s $20-$21 is a relative bargain, especially with Prime shipping. Anyways, it greatly reduces my facial blemishes but it hasn&#x27;t totally eliminated them. I&#x27;ve had no problem with burning or skin dryness.</li>
    <li> I really like this cleanser.  It cleans my face very well and I do not have trouble with the pores filling up</li>
    <li> Just like the identical product I purchased from my dermotologist &amp; this product from Amazon was much more afforrable. Super!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me when I had a facial back in December.  I am in my early 40&#x27;s and still struggle with oily skin, clogged pores and breakouts.

I was so happy to find it on Amazon&#x27;s website and recommend it to my friends.  It leaves your skin so soft!</li>

    <li> doesn&#x27;t feel like it cleans</li>
    <li> Great product.  I use it every evening and will continue ordering it.</li>
    <li> Purchased was shipped quickly and its a great product, and half the price you pay in a med-spa or doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of the Neocutis products and this one is at the same level of effectiveness as all of their products. A bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
    <li> I just started to used this product and when I use it -it make my skin feel so clean-it is not harsh on your face-and it help hears acne scars as well..</li>

    <li> I use with my Clarisonic and my skin looks amazing ....I&#x27;m 62 and sometimes got tiny cysts......no more!  Much better than using stuff with  microbeads which are terrible for the environment !!!  An aesthetician recommended this along with the Claisonic.  She was right!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to my by my dermatologist and I now use it all the time.  Great on sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product and especially love that I can get it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I like it.  I have never tried it before, but&lt;br /&gt;have tried other Neocutis products.&lt;br /&gt;No problems with my order.</li>
