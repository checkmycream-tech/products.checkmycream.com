      <li>I didn &#x27;t expect it to hurt so much.</li>
      <li>The needles are sharper and much easier to use.</li>
      <li>, if i use it  gently, i don&#x27;t feel that it has done much, i don&#x27;t get any redness or signs that that it is penetrating my skin, just feels like you have a bunch of needles that you&#x27;re moving on your skin that don&#x27;t even poke.</li>

<li> I haven&#x27;t seen major results yet, besides my skins overall appearance.</li>
<li> I woke up the next morning and not only could I tell the dark marks were lighter</li>
<li> The roller is much smaller than I expected but works as described.</li>
<li> It left my skin really rough.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times but it seems to make my skin look younger.  </li>
<li> It is roughly an inch wide and with the handle around 5 inches long.</li>
<li> I notice my pores appear smaller, and the dents around my mouth look less pronounced.</li>
<li> but I had little needle point black heads that weren&#x27;t like normal black heads that I could remove with a pore strip.</li>
<li> And then over the next few days it begins to shed and peel.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m going to get one of the narrow ones next for around my eyes and nose.</li>
<li> I have purchased other brands and the needles didn&#x27;t even feel like they were penetrating my skin.</li>
<li> I examined very carefully, looking for any bent tips and found none.</li>
<li> So now I put  the retin a cremê on my dark marks and benzoyl peroxide cremê on active acne after needling.</li>
<li> and i do it maybe every other day or ever few days depending and how my skin feels.</li>
<li> less no.</li>
<li> It feels like after using it you have a slight sunburn on your forehead and cheeks</li>
<li> so I would think rollers with less</li>
<li> jus a little the 1st time</li>
<li> I was a little intimidated with all the needles.</li>
<li> It does hurt a little bit</li>
<li> It does hurt a little when you roll it over your skin, but just  little.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over two months now about once or twice a week.</li>
<li> but it may burn just a little after you use it, but that means it&#x27;s working.</li>
<li> Ive noticed my oiliness has gone down, my complexion is brighter, The dark spots on my face are slowly disappearing, and almost all gone, and im noticing</li>
<li> It is mildly painful but after a few uses it does not hurt as much.</li>
<li> Took a really long time to receive. &#x3D;(</li>
<li> There&#x27;s nothing worse that damaging your skin by using products that are suppose to help it.</li>
<li> A bunch of bent and broken needles.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works very well. I have seen results in 2weeks of using the product. It&#x27;s a beauty must have!</li>
    <li> Horrible product!! Cheap price&#x3D;cheap product. Since I would be poking my face with a bunch of tiny needles, I made sure to take a close look at the product and what did I see? A bunch of bent and broken needles. I&#x27;m glad I did or I would have damaged my skin! Ladies, if you are purchasing this product, I would recommend you take a good close look at the needles before using it on your face. There&#x27;s nothing worse that damaging your skin by using products that are suppose to help it.</li>
    <li> I love this! #1 it came early! And #2 the 1st night I used it I used it on my whole face but more on my cheeks because I was trying to get rid of the dark marks there. I woke up the next morning and not only could I tell the dark marks were lighter but I had little needle point black heads that weren&#x27;t like normal black heads that I could remove with a pore strip. NOTHING could get rid of them, but they were gone!!! I am on the medication Retin A for my acne so I put that on after I did the needling. Now I read somewhere that when needling it&#x27;s good to use your prescription cremê afterwards because those cremes sometimes don&#x27;t get down in the skin. So needling creates the holes so they can seep in. So now I put  the retin a cremê on my dark marks and benzoyl peroxide cremê on active acne after needling. And it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job!   P.S- Im 16 yrs old. And got the 1.00 m length and it&#x27;s hurts jus a little the 1st time but u&#x27;ll get used to it quick. I only tear up a bit when I&#x27;m on the forehead, but that&#x27;s normal.</li>
    <li> This derma roller is not the best however, for the price is good. I bought the 1.0 &amp; 1.5. The I.0 I use for my face is painless it doesn&#x27;t feel like needles at all. I&#x27;ve used the 1.5 once in my stretch marks &amp; it has gave me an allergic reaction or something my skin is very Itchy were I derma roll but I will continue to derma roll is weird because I use the 1.0 for my face &amp; I have no problem.</li>
    <li> I just got my roller today and I just love it, it feels good on the face. It feels like after using it you have a slight sunburn on your forehead and cheeks that&#x27;s all. You can feel it working. Please make sure you read the box it comes in to know how to use it. I hope you all enjoy this roller as much as I do thank you Yorktex for sending it, love it and cant wait to see more results from it thanks again</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. I&#x27;d recommend reading up on everything you can find about dermarolling on the internet before using it though. Cause I can see how this could be used incorrectly. But Ive had it maybe a month now and i do it maybe every other day or ever few days depending and how my skin feels. Ive noticed my oiliness has gone down, my complexion is brighter, The dark spots on my face are slowly disappearing, and almost all gone, and im noticing some of my older acne scars (craters) are slowly becoming less noticeable. I recommend this  product to all of my friends who suffer with my acne problems.</li>
    <li> So far I have been using it twice a week for two weeks. I notice my skin looks more supple and absorbs moisturizer much better after each use. The roller is much smaller than I expected but works as described. It is roughly an inch wide and with the handle around 5 inches long. It is mildly painful but after a few uses it does not hurt as much. I make sure to sanitize it before and after use every time with rubbing alcohol. I definitely would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This was gentle but did what it said it would do. I was red all over but not bleeding, followed instructions and used a calming chamomile &amp; sea weed toner (no alcohol) to soothe and cleanse my skin afterward. I did this at night so my skin was nice and rested in the morning. During the next few days, my skin was healing and looked good.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking when I bought this. I bruise very easily, and this device immediately caused red bruises/cuts on my hands, later turning to blue. Would not recommend this thing to anyone. There are better, more gentle things to increase collagen and plumping of the skin: Hyarlonic Acid Serum and Collagen serum. And they don&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this particular model for dermarolling. I have purchased other brands and the needles didn&#x27;t even feel like they were penetrating my skin. Tried this one on my forehead and in the trash it went.</li>
    <li> The quality of this product surpasses expectations for price- I would expect to pay minimum $20 for the quality. It even comes in a nice clear plastic storing container. Highly recommend for someone looking for a quality at-home (non-commercial) dermaroller.</li>
    <li> I was searching for another low cost, effective micro needle roller since I lost my other one. This is great! Needles are sturdy, it&#x27;s easy to use and works wonders on my acne scars! Yay!</li>
    <li> Took a really long time to receive. &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> As described. I examined very carefully, looking for any bent tips and found none. Used on face and neck with success. Pain level very tolerable. Washed skin then Applied vitamin E oil before and after use.</li>
    <li> It left my skin really rough. I&#x27;ll try it again in 30 days that&#x27;s is the next you should do it again. I&#x27;ll leave another review</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over two months now about once or twice a week. I haven&#x27;t noticed dramatic results but I&#x27;ve noticed a bit of a difference in the overall texture of my skin. I wash my face daily and use acne lotion with it. It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all but it may burn just a little after you use it, but that means it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> holy moly I love this thing I was wasting too much money on my serums and lotions before I found this thing I would recommend it to everyone I didn&#x27;t need a lot of repairing just wanted to take better care of my face and the difference is unreal I love this product quick shipping easy to use and easy to store its part of my weekly beauty regimen :)</li>
    <li> Just received them. Really excited!! It does hurt a little when you roll it over your skin, but just  little. It does feel like it might work. I started with a 1mm and will be using it followed by a vit c and collagen boosting serum. Hopefully it works.</li>
    <li> I liked it and I&#x27;ve been using every month, yes it works my face had acne scarfs and they are not noticeable.</li>
    <li> this derma needle is great - make sure to use plenty of vitamin E and you&#x27;ll have fab results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times but it seems to make my skin look younger.  It does hurt a little bit but...I guess&lt;br /&gt; no pain, no gain. Will keep using a couple of times a week.</li>
    <li> I was a little intimidated with all the needles. But after doing my extensive research I gave it a shot. I followed the diagram that was included in the instructions. And I felt the difference right away. The sleek design is great and now I&#x27;m a pro at handling this easy and necessary beauty utensil. It arrived just as the seller noted.  I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is such a scary and amazing product. I use it about once every two weeks. I started with a .05mm, and worked my way up to a .1mm. I&#x27;m going to get one of the narrow ones next for around my eyes and nose. If you decide to do this, do not be surprised if it hurts. You are poking your skin with needles. I have good pain management because I used an Epilady for years on my legs. It takes a certain kind of person to put themselves through that kind of torture in the name of beauty. But I do immediately see an improvement in my skin within 24 hours - it looks smoother and firmer. And then over the next few days it begins to shed and peel. (This is supposed to happen). And then my skin is fresh and new and smooth. I notice my pores appear smaller, and the dents around my mouth look less pronounced. You want to make sure while you&#x27;re using this that you stay VERY moisturized and always use an SPF. It may help to take an Advil 30 minutes prior, like some people do when waxing. I also try to limit my intake of alcohol, it dries you out from the inside. I use this with a mixed bag of really good skincare, jojoba oil to cleanse my skin, and Frownies. If you are consistent, you will see consistent improvement. Happy needling!!!</li>
    <li> Purchased 1.0 and 1.5 dermaroller.&lt;br /&gt;Have used it for 2 weeks and am&lt;br /&gt;seeing changes in scar tissue.&lt;br /&gt;Being consistent with use and having&lt;br /&gt;patience, this product should return&lt;br /&gt;noticeable results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s super nice. I haven&#x27;t seen major results yet, besides my skins overall appearance. I can&#x27;t wait to see what a few more treatments will do.</li>
    <li> All I can say is: do not spend a lot of money to needle. My first was much more expensive. And not anywhere near as nice as this. The needles are sharper and much easier to use. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> so I bought both the 1mm for my face and the 1.5mm for my body, even though this dermaroller is cheap, its good, the head rolls pretty good so it doesn&#x27;t get stuck so won&#x27;t gives you scratches, if i use it  gently, i don&#x27;t feel that it has done much, i don&#x27;t get any redness or signs that that it is penetrating my skin, just feels like you have a bunch of needles that you&#x27;re moving on your skin that don&#x27;t even poke. that&#x27;s why i have to apply good pressure on it, and now it starts to hurt a lot, the pain is 6-7/10, I was reading somewhere that using rollers with less needles (less no. and farther apart from each other) will have a better penetration without all that pressure needed, it&#x27;s called &amp;#34;fakir effect&amp;#34;. so I would think rollers with less no. of needles are gonna penetrate deeper easier and less painful, an I have noticed that on the more expensive rollers (most of them have fewer needles), but as for this roller, this cheap i think it works well, but you just need o prepare yourself for the pain especially under the eyes area.</li>
    <li> This product is so amazing.  I was able to see signs of skin repair in three days. The old skin that I rolled begin to peel off. Love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I  think it works well. I didn &#x27;t expect it to hurt so much. Oh well... the price of beauty!!</li>
