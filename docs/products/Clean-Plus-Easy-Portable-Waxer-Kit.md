      <li>I tried my legs and they worked great!</li>
      <li>-The wax that comes in the bottle is not the best.</li>
      <li>but it is perfect for what I needed.</li>

      <li>so I am happy.</li>
      <li>; just to let you know she is very happy with your product and its very easy to use.</li>
      <li>I will probably try to find muslin strips again, since I&#x27;ve always had good luck with them.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not that much good.</li>
      <li>-in-all, I think this is a good unit for the price.</li>
      <li>I bought it ,it&#x27;s really good though,and I liked</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
      <li>I forgot about people saying it took over an hour to warm up</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been waxing for years, and really thought this would be perfect.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;ll start by saying I&#x27;ve been waxing my own legs and under arms for over 10 years (since puberty) using at home wax kits.</li>
      <li>Very nice product, everything is fine with this.</li>
      <li>The best part is that there is practically NO MESS!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very easy to use;</li>
      <li>This work very easy</li>
      <li>I was able to wax my arms so quickly, and loved the ease of rolling</li>
      <li>I am glad to report mt Clean+Easy roll-on waxer still works</li>
      <li>I love this because it has a lid and container.</li>
      <li>is that they refill the bottle with Gigi wax that they have warmed up from a tub and are able to pour into the container).</li>
      <li>If I could do it over, I would probably search for a waxer that could hold my favorite brand.</li>
      <li>The warmer doesn&#x27;t look like much, but it works great</li>
      <li>its ok, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone or buy it again if I had to do it</li>
      <li>so the wax on your skin won&#x27;t start cooling before you are able to pull it off.</li>
      <li>Have been really happy with this roll on wax unit, saves me time and money in between professional waxing.</li>
      <li>( I had wax on me for 2 days), the only thing I liked its really fun to do and those sheets are good to use!</li>
      <li>Overall it is good and it is a money saver for sure!</li>
      <li>Despite leaving wax on the warmer for quite some time, the wax did not glide on as easily as it did with the included wax.</li>
      <li>Easy</li>
      <li>wax in the kit is fine.</li>
      <li>This little warmer is absolutely great!</li>
      <li>They are very reusable which is nice.</li>
      <li>But I cant&#x27; seem to get my underarms hair free.</li>
      <li>This will 1) allow wax to get warm, 2) not give too much time</li>
      <li>The wax did not go on smoothly</li>
      <li>To my surprise it rolled on as clean and easily as I saw/felt in the salon.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>The wax is a nice temperature and when heated correctly rolls out nicely and lifts easily enough with the strips.    </li>
      <li>I had actually originally ordered this for my sister, but the packaging was so beat up</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read so many reviews before I bought this waxer, I was so excited to use it for the first time.</li>
      <li>But I was excited to see if it worked</li>
      <li>I was really excited about this product</li>
      <li>I was really excited about this affordable roll on waxing kit.  </li>
      <li>No mess, no sticky, quick and good results!it</li>
      <li>and after waxing I leave it in a plastic container of baby oil for days which softens the wax and makes it easier to clean.</li>
      <li>Clean+</li>
      <li>Clean n Eazy portable roll on wax kit - for my wife</li>
      <li>As far as supplies, you get a starter kit of 15 removal cloths (really nice - they were smooth and didn&#x27;t leave fuzzies like the muslin cloths) and one wax cartridge (one full leg wax used up about ¾ of the catridge.)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fast, it&#x27;s painless, it&#x27;s clean, and it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for anybody especially for that price!!&lt;br /&gt;Really good</li>
      <li>At this point the light is rarely on but my element still heats and that is what I need</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s perfect solution for people with excessive hair growth!</li>
      <li>/&gt;The included papers seem adequate.</li>
      <li>/&gt;do even an adequate job of hair removal.</li>
      <li>sure you buy enough supply for free shipping).</li>
      <li>Now I kind of wish I would have sent it back and just got something else</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t be able to use my favorite brand due to the size difference.</li>
      <li>wax doesn&#x27;t stay warm for very long once you remove the hand held portion from the charger, so you have to be fairly quick and proficient at self waxing.</li>
      <li>It seems to separate much more easily if it&#x27;s left at its full width.</li>
      <li>On the upside, this wax does not seem to irritate the skin, and I have pretty histaminic skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so the wax gets hot.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product once, and I will edit this review when I use it again if my experience goes better.     </li>
      <li>do it first</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re a first time/inexperienced waxer I would suggest having a salon</li>
      <li>if you can&#x27;t see any of the wax, how are you supposed to know if the bubbles are rising to the top entirely?</li>
      <li>Make sure to wash well with soap after so roller won&#x27;t be oily and wax can stick on roller for next waxing session.</li>
      <li>I have to leave mine on plugged for like an hour for wax to get hot- and is not even THAT hot then.</li>
      <li>;-)</li>
      <li>After 10 years my first one broke....</li>
      <li>that I was willing to pay $36 one time in the hopes of not having to repeatedly pay the 20+ for wax jobs.</li>
      <li>I have read other reviews that said 30-40 mins to warm up</li>
      <li>so I could wax easily at home, but this one took too long to warm the wax, and even after that, was super sticky and a mess to apply.</li>
      <li>pretty much plug-n-wax</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t help that the person who was helping me with it was going pretty fast</li>
      <li>Its not messy and heats up quick.</li>
      <li>and it wasn&#x27;t strong enough to remove the wax residue from my legs.</li>
      <li>Since my method was the same, the only things I can conclude which could&#x27;ve made for the difference is that either the machine did not function the same after the second time or, most likely, the machines work best with the wax it comes with compared to the Gigi and refill pack I bought.</li>
      <li>worth the price and is way cheaper than professional saloons!</li>
      <li>The wax takes about 30 min to warm, and you can do your entire legs in about 20 min (count another 10-15 minutes for the back of your thighs, unless you&#x27;re some sort of yoga master ;-)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s less obnoxious than a lot of the pot waxes, so I&#x27;m happy enough with it.</li>
      <li>Thanks again.&lt;br /&gt;Ali</li>
      <li>so much</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable giving it to her as a gift, so purchased a different brand for her.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really know if its the wax or the strips or a combo of both, but every time I have tried to wax my underarms</li>
      <li>really well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is a much cleaner means of applying wax.</li>
      <li>Also, you will REALLY want a wax remover to go along with this set.</li>
      <li>I was very excited about using this product, but its not as i expected..</li>
      <li>I may try some of the other waxes available to see if they do a better or worse job and will come back and add to this review with any remarkable findings.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say if you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive, less messy means of waxing easily accessible areas, this unit is a good deal.</li>
      <li>I could see that I wasn&#x27;t pulling the hair out, however, but I was instead breaking it at the end, I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s because of my technique or with the wax, I&#x27;m going to go ahead and say that&#x27;s mostly my own fault.    </li>
      <li>The cloth strips are nice, but a bit long for first time waxers, so I cut them in half.</li>
      <li>I am accustomed to muslin strips, so these were new to me.</li>
      <li>and I actually didn&#x27;t even get it in all the way at first.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It stops working after few months. it sucks. Do NOT buy it.</li>
    <li> wax doesn&#x27;t stay warm for very long once you remove the hand held portion from the charger, so you have to be fairly quick and proficient at self waxing. Also, cleaning the roller head is quite difficult. Apparently there&#x27;s a separate branded cleaner you are supposed to buy, but I dont want to so I&#x27;m looking for alternatives in my already bursting cleaning closet. But given how much it&#x27;s going to save me at the salon, small problems really.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once, and I will edit this review when I use it again if my experience goes better.     The first problem I had with it was that it was difficult to fit the wax carton into the heater and I actually didn&#x27;t even get it in all the way at first. I thought it was in all the way with about an inch of the carton visible but it was only after it had warmed up and I tried to use it a few times (failing miserably because the wax wouldn&#x27;t roll out at all) and I put the clear cap back on that is suddenly just pushed in all the way. Make sure the carton is all the way into the heater, and by all the way I mean you cannot see any of the wax on the sides.    That leads me to my second point, if you can&#x27;t see any of the wax, how are you supposed to know if the bubbles are rising to the top entirely? I had to wiggle the container out to double check and then push it back in.    The cloth strips are nice, but a bit long for first time waxers, so I cut them in half. They are very reusable which is nice. The wax is a nice temperature and when heated correctly rolls out nicely and lifts easily enough with the strips.    I could see that I wasn&#x27;t pulling the hair out, however, but I was instead breaking it at the end, I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s because of my technique or with the wax, I&#x27;m going to go ahead and say that&#x27;s mostly my own fault.    Also, you will REALLY want a wax remover to go along with this set. I only had a container of jojoba oil and it wasn&#x27;t strong enough to remove the wax residue from my legs.</li>
    <li> After 10 years my first one broke.... only after I dropped it on the floor! This is my second one, so yes, I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who waxes at home.</li>
    <li> This little warmer is absolutely great! The beautician used it on me at my local nail &amp; wax salon, and since I travel so much for work, I figured I would buy one for myself and skip the hassle of finding a local salon or forking over a small fortune at the hotel spa... It&#x27;s really small, so it doesn&#x27;t take up much space in my suitcase (about the same as a small hairdryer.) It&#x27;s also very easy to use; pretty much plug-n-wax ;-) The wax takes about 30 min to warm, and you can do your entire legs in about 20 min (count another 10-15 minutes for the back of your thighs, unless you&#x27;re some sort of yoga master ;-) The best part is that there is practically NO MESS!!! As far as supplies, you get a starter kit of 15 removal cloths (really nice - they were smooth and didn&#x27;t leave fuzzies like the muslin cloths) and one wax cartridge (one full leg wax used up about ¾ of the catridge.) Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase. The warmer doesn&#x27;t look like much, but it works great, it wasn&#x27;t too expensive, and even the supplies are reasonably priced. And I&#x27;m thinking it will last, since they use it at my local salon, which is always packed...   &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I found it to be messy and difficult to clean up after use. Time for heat up inconvenient for those leading a busy life and it did not&lt;br /&gt;do even an adequate job of hair removal.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this product so I could start waxing my legs and underarms at home. I don&#x27;t really know if its the wax or the strips or a combo of both, but every time I have tried to wax my underarms I can never get the hair to come off, and I&#x27;m just left with a mess of wax under my arms. I tried my legs and they worked great! But I cant&#x27; seem to get my underarms hair free. I am going to try different strips, especially cause these tend to like shred when you go to pull, so you&#x27;ll have part of the strip in your hand and the rest will still be on your leg/underarm where ever.&lt;br /&gt;Overall its ok, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone or buy it again if I had to do it over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when I received it the box was damaged and it looked like it had been previously used or opened, which made me feel weird about it. But I was excited to see if it worked so I didn&#x27;t bother sending it back for a replacement. Now I kind of wish I would have sent it back and just got something else, ohh well too late now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read so many reviews before I bought this waxer, I was so excited to use it for the first time. But ..... the roller doesn&#x27;t even roll, i had to do it with an ice cream stick,and of course it&#x27;s impossible to clean it up.  even with baby oil it&#x27;s kinda hard to clean myself up, ( I had wax on me for 2 days), the only thing I liked its really fun to do and those sheets are good to use!</li>
    <li> I like it! takes a while to heat up. otherwise great!</li>
    <li> I bought it ,it&#x27;s really good though,and I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for anybody especially for that price!!&lt;br /&gt;Really good</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this affordable roll on waxing kit.  Unfortunately it arrived to me broken.  The roller component would bit fit into the charging base.</li>
    <li> The best stuff for hair removal I ever found! It&#x27;s fast, it&#x27;s painless, it&#x27;s clean, and it&#x27;s cheap! I have a sensitive skin which usually gets irritated after wax procedure, but after using this product my skin is just perfectly smooth! First I doubted if I should buy this waxer because other hair removal products never worked for me the way I wanted. Now I would recommend this portable waxer to everyone. Trust me- it&#x27;s perfect solution for people with excessive hair growth!</li>
    <li> waste of time and money. It takes forever to heat the wax and the bottle design is so bad that half the wax is stuck inside it. It will take 5 hours to just wax arms alone. very inefficient and lousy product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing for years, and really thought this would be perfect. Nop! Awful sticky, messy, like glue. Didn&#x27;t roll on, and didn&#x27;t wax off. Simply terrible. Wish I&#x27;d never tried it cause I couldn&#x27;t return it :o(</li>
    <li> I have been on a ten-year hiatus from waxing, as I was finding it messy and much of the time less effective than shaving my legs. I saw this unit on the Lightning Deals and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m glad I did! It is a much cleaner means of applying wax. No more sticks with dripping strings of resin all over the counters and my person. I had actually originally ordered this for my sister, but the packaging was so beat up I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable giving it to her as a gift, so purchased a different brand for her. I would have exchanged it, but that was not an option when I wrote the company. They assured me that the unit wasn&#x27;t used or refurbed, so I decided to keep it and give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t without its learning curves -- I found if I didn&#x27;t place the clear plastic cap back on in between, the surface wax would cool a little and make for a jerky start. It&#x27;s also essential to place it back on the charger between each individual application so it doesn&#x27;t start to solidify. It does take a bit of effort to get the roller to start working initially, but once it does, it goes on evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included papers seem adequate. I am accustomed to muslin strips, so these were new to me. They do adhere to the wax well. They also stand up to the &amp;#34;blotting&amp;#34; when a bit of wax is left behind and you use the strip to &amp;#34;blot&amp;#34; it up. The only issue I ran into was using it full-width. It seems to separate much more easily if it&#x27;s left at its full width. I had it separate and when I pulled the remaining piece of strip off wanted to pass out it hurt so badly. So I cut them length-wise and this seemed to remedy that problem. I will probably try to find muslin strips again, since I&#x27;ve always had good luck with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax in the kit is fine. It&#x27;s less obnoxious than a lot of the pot waxes, so I&#x27;m happy enough with it. I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it came up a little easier -- I ended up using massage oil to dissolve the small bits that wouldn&#x27;tcome up with the papers. I just noticed there are still tiny shiny bits of wax on my legs in some places -- I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll come off in the shower, but that&#x27;s still a little annoying. On the upside, this wax does not seem to irritate the skin, and I have pretty histaminic skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a small area of my bikini line and it hurt like crazy, but the after-effects don&#x27;t seem to be too drastic. I don&#x27;t wax my arms, but if I did, I think this would work really well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I think this is a good unit for the price. I may try some of the other waxes available to see if they do a better or worse job and will come back and add to this review with any remarkable findings. I&#x27;d say if you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive, less messy means of waxing easily accessible areas, this unit is a good deal.</li>
    <li> I have like a small Spa at home! This work very easy, I am happy with it! I just used it some hours ago...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use the roller or anything. I just wanted it for waxing my eyebrows and stache fuzz. I use a tooth pick, it works well. The problem with the traditional waxers is I didn&#x27;t need that much wax for one, two they are way messier, and finally I spilled and ruined two previous waxers plus the stuff that got ruined from the wax. I love this because it has a lid and container. Its not messy and heats up quick. I don&#x27;t know I if I would use it to wax other areas but it is perfect for what I needed.</li>
    <li> I got this thing to work once, and two days later the wax wouldn&#x27;t heat. Wish I could&#x27;ve returned it but I was travelling and didn&#x27;t have the time. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, everything is fine with this. Nothing negative.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy over time it gets sticky and messy I just threw it out</li>
    <li> just a total mess. I wanted to try this instead of my gigi wax warmer. The wax did not go on smoothly and I don&#x27;t think I even got to wax my legs. I threw it way.</li>
    <li> I like the waxer, and it does seem that it&#x27;ll be a lot less messier than my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it  holds tall wax dispensers while I am used to the smaller size. Not a big deal except that I&#x27;ll need to order my wax online instead of purchasing at my local store like I usually do. Also, my preferred brand of wax is not Clean &amp; Easy because it&#x27;s not as brittle on the skin. I won&#x27;t be able to use my favorite brand due to the size difference. Again, not the end of the world, just a little disappointed. If I could do it over, I would probably search for a waxer that could hold my favorite brand.</li>
    <li> I have used this product 3 times already! Overall it is good and it is a money saver for sure! It gets the job done. My only complain is that you have to wait a long time for wax to get hot. I have read other reviews that said 30-40 mins to warm up, however, I don&#x27;t think that is long enough. I have to leave mine on plugged for like an hour for wax to get hot- and is not even THAT hot then. I mean it does do the job, it is just a pain when you have to wait around for an hour so the wax gets hot.</li>
    <li> Thank you for on time delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Bought Clean n Eazy portable roll on wax kit - for my wife; just to let you know she is very happy with your product and its very easy to use. Also, I would recommend consumers to buy the wax from you guys since your price is good(make sure you buy enough supply for free shipping). Thanks again.&lt;br /&gt;Ali</li>
    <li> Its taking lot of time, working only on small portions. If you apply big portions not working. Time consuming. Not that much good.</li>
    <li> Customer service solved all my problems promptly (after I let them know I was having them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the waxer itself... well applying the wax with a roller was very uncomfortable compared to applying it with a stick and it didn&#x27;t help that the person who was helping me with it was going pretty fast (I&#x27;m a man who got this for his back). I would say using the roller was less cool than actually pulling the hair out. However, it did its job the way it was supposed to do and the mess normally associated with waxing was much reduced. The wax itself was very hard to remove afterwards, usually a little oil takes wax off pretty easy but not with this stuff. My skin was sticky and weird feeling for days. So, if they have a wax remover specifically for this application, I would definitely get it because its pretty tacky even for hard wax.</li>
    <li> Have been really happy with this roll on wax unit, saves me time and money in between professional waxing. Takes practice. Cotton strips (left-over sheet) works well to remove hair.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone. I wanted a handheld type of a waxer so I could wax easily at home, but this one took too long to warm the wax, and even after that, was super sticky and a mess to apply. Even after you have applied the strip and taken it off, my hands felt really sticky and it was impossible to get rid off. I tried washing multiple times with soap, applied aloe vera and lotion, but the stickiness remained. Moreover, the wax did not work well for my skin, and I had really bad red rashes for almost a week after. The roller could not be cleaned after a single application and I had to throw away the entire package. Very unfortunate.</li>
    <li> This product just works perfectly. No mess, no sticky, quick and good results!it worth the price and is way cheaper than professional saloons!</li>
    <li> I was very excited about using this product, but its not as i expected..</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ll start by saying I&#x27;ve been waxing my own legs and under arms for over 10 years (since puberty) using at home wax kits. I tried waxing my own arms once in January using the extra strength all-over body wax that I use for my legs and intimate areas, but this only left my arms with big red splotches as if I had been abused (I was concerned this would happen that&#x27;s why I tried it during winter where I could hide under long sleeves). So I went to a wax salon in Sept to get my arms waxed (no red splotches) and took note of the brand of their roll-on system, which was this one, since I didn&#x27;t want to have to shell out $20 plus tip to get them done again. I had read soooo many reviews about this product and the other personal (non-portable) warmer from &amp;#34;Clean + Easy&amp;#34; before making a purchase, and decided that even though it seemed like half of the reviews said it worked and half said it didn&#x27;t, that I was willing to pay $36 one time in the hopes of not having to repeatedly pay the 20+ for wax jobs. The night I planned to wax I forgot about people saying it took over an hour to warm up so was disappointed I would get started way late, but I turned on the warmer and after 40 minutes when I remembered to check the wax, it was already warm/hot and melted. I spread baby powder on my arms, as I had seen the woman in the salon do, and prepared for the pulling feeling of a wax that got cold too quick, as the reviews mentioned. To my surprise it rolled on as clean and easily as I saw/felt in the salon. I was able to wax my arms so quickly, and loved the ease of rolling so much I went on to roll to random parts I noticed fuzz on. Notes: -I suggest doing a couple(2-4) rolls of wax then placing wax on warmer. This will 1) allow wax to get warm, 2) not give too much time so the wax on your skin won&#x27;t start cooling before you are able to pull it off. If you are new at waxing then maybe max 2 rolls as it might take a little longer. -If you&#x27;re a first time/inexperienced waxer I would suggest having a salon do it first so you can see and take notes of the techniques they use so you don&#x27;t have to go through trial and errors that may result in red splotches. -The wax that comes in the bottle is not the best. What I have seen in 2 salons I went to (one did arms, one did legs) is that they refill the bottle with Gigi wax that they have warmed up from a tub and are able to pour into the container). -Like I said, the wax from the bottle is veeeerry sticky. It&#x27;s definitely not water soluble and doesn&#x27;t come off with oil as easily as my extra strength wax does. I am still working on getting it off the roller :/  So what I can say is that it seems like maybe some machines are faulty and others aren&#x27;t. But if the machine works, it&#x27;s definitely recommended. As a very experienced self-waxer I am very happy with my purchase :) *Will make adjustments to review in future if necessary  June 2013 ~8 months after purchasing  After finishing the wax the bottle came with I bought the Gigi all-purpose honey wax and used this to refill the bottle in the roller as I had seen in the salon. This was a hassle as 1)I did not have the Gigi warmer so had to warm the canister by putting it in a pot of water I heated, and 2) it was a mess when I tried to pour from canister to bottle since I am inexperienced at pouring such sticky fluids. I used about 80% of the Gigi wax and decided I did not care to go through the hassle and use the rest of it. I then purchased a 6-pack of the Clean+Easy wax refill which is what I am currently using.  Following the same procedure (cleaning area, towel and air drying and then applying baby powder) as I did the first &amp; second effortless times when I used the included wax, these other waxing experiences were not quite so painless. Despite leaving wax on the warmer for quite some time, the wax did not glide on as easily as it did with the included wax. Since my method was the same, the only things I can conclude which could&#x27;ve made for the difference is that either the machine did not function the same after the second time or, most likely, the machines work best with the wax it comes with compared to the Gigi and refill pack I bought. Since they are both from Clean+ Easy I thought the wax the machine came with and my 6 pack of refills would be the same but the refills are not as sticky as the one it came with so I def think they are different. Despite the stickyness of the included wax, I much prefer having to do a little extra rubbing off with oil than the pulling feeling while trying to roll on the wax. My rating has decreased to a 3.5 (a 3 here since I can&#x27;t do half stars) Hopefully if I find a wax that rolls on as well as the included wax I can bump it back up to the 5. Btw, the issue of wax being stuck to roller isn&#x27;t specific to the included wax. This happens after every waxing session. What I did was buy a 3 pack of the roller heads(rather inexpensive, ~$6) and after waxing I leave it in a plastic container of baby oil for days which softens the wax and makes it easier to clean. Make sure to wash well with soap after so roller won&#x27;t be oily and wax can stick on roller for next waxing session. *Will make adjustments to review in future if necessary  Jan 2015 ~a little &amp;#62;2 years after ourchasing  I am glad to report mt Clean+Easy roll-on waxer still works and I continue to use it for all my waxing needs. A couple of months ago the green light on the machine started flickering and going off at times. I was afraid this meant the system stopped heating but I tested it and it does not. At this point the light is rarely on but my element still heats and that is what I need so I am happy. In retrospect, I realize that decreasing my rating due to less glide of the different wax was not fair as the would technically be more a review of the wax than the system. It heats well and has worked with me for over 2 years, so even if it crapped out at this point ::fingers crossed it doesn&#x27;t:: It still saved me much money from going to salon and red splotches from trying to apply wax with a stick so my I renew my 5 star rating of it.</li>
