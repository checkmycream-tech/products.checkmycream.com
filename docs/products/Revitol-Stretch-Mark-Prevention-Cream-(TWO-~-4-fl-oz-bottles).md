      <li>ur strech mark will be reduce somehow because you will be very disapointed!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;After a first application, i did not like the smell of this product!</li>
      <li>so I missed that 5 weeks where you get huge fast.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with the results thus far.  </li>
      <li>After reading studies and hundreds of reviews all over the Internet, I decided it was worth a try, so I purchased a 6-bottle pack.  </li>
      <li>but well worth it.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product upon finding out I was pregnant with my first child to prevent stretch marks.</li>
      <li>Reasonable price makes this a worthy investment.</li>
      <li>Not as good as I expected, but made skin soft.</li>
      <li>I have a six month old daughter and while I was pregnant I got tons of stretch marks.</li>
      <li>Which I was very satisfied and surprised about b/c thats never happened before with other sellers.</li>
      <li>so I believe it really works.</li>
      <li>So I was looking REALLY hard to find an honest review that seemed real and not too one sided.</li>

      <li>It definitely keeps your skin nice and supple a lot longer than any other lotion I tried.</li>
      <li>Purchased to bottles right away, but they sent me only one.</li>
      <li>Most stretch mark crems have a very funny smell and this one has a tiny odd odor but minor.      </li>
      <li>Works really well, I&#x27;ve only been using for a week and can see changes in color of stretch marks</li>
      <li>I WILL buy this for my next pregnancy and really believe it is the reason I do not have stretch mark because trust me the rest of the ladies in the family do.</li>
      <li>Its to early to see results</li>
      <li>I used it religiously twice a day starting at 3 months into my pregnancy with my first child.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product, and I&#x27;ll be purchasing it again today for my 2nd pregnancy!</li>
      <li>I have been using the rest of my revitol on my thighs for the last 10 days and they are nearly gone.</li>
      <li>I really hoped that this cream will help a little bit, but NO it doesnt work at all</li>

<li> I used a different brand, mustella, last pregnancy and only got 1 minor stretch mark</li>
<li> This product is living up to its reputation, is widely used by average joes and celebs alike to reduce and prevent stretch marks (particularly during pregnancy, which is my personal reason for using it).</li>
<li> I just finished my pregancy and thankfully made it through without a single stretch mark.  </li>
<li> A little definitely goes a long way and the results are undeniable.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not work I expected.</li>
<li> I also received this product before the expected delivery time.</li>
<li> Its does not absorb as i had expected.</li>
<li> I havent used them at all, such a waste of money!</li>
<li> Darren from \\&quot;Easy Checkout\\&quot; customer service offered me to give me a refund for all the troubles I had with my order if I delete my bad review</li>
<li> I give it 4 stars due to the fact that 6 bottles was not adequate, so I had to purchase an additional 2 bottles.</li>
<li> The only thing I can say positive is that my stretch marks are not as bad</li>
<li> and I waited to write a review until I saw anything on my belly, after all stretch marks on the breasts can just happen because of a not very supportive spots bra.</li>
<li> I put on everyday up to giving birth</li>
<li> I have used two tubes of this, I am 23 weeks pregnant, and im honestly disappointed.</li>
<li> I was a little hesitant to spend the money on this cream but, now that I&#x27;ve been using it for 12 weeks, I would not hesitate to buy it over and over again!</li>
<li> I ordered two small tubes and it took over a week to get delivered.  </li>
<li> My entire family got stretch marks (bad ones).</li>
<li> they smell awful and don&#x27;t have the same consistency than the ones I got before I don&#x27;t know if they are fake or old if you are getting some from here</li>
<li> So a few days ago I got some faint ones on my belly but their getting worse.</li>
<li> I had this awful red stretch mark for about a year, and after a few application of Bio-Oil they disappeared!</li>
<li> I insist this is de worst customer service ever!!!</li>
<li> This is the worst purchase experience ever!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Nobody knows what is going on with my item. Today is August 10th and the delivery promise was on July 28. This is the worst purchase experience ever!!! And you all ready charged me more than $80 to my credit card!! Unbelievable!!!\\&quot;    Now today is September 26. Darren from \\&quot;Easy Checkout\\&quot; customer service offered me to give me a refund for all the troubles I had with my order if I delete my bad review so I did it. The thing was that he didn&#x27;t keep his promise and he didn&#x27;t give me my refund so that is why Im writing again this review.    I insist this is de worst customer service ever!!!</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to spend the money on this cream but, now that I&#x27;ve been using it for 12 weeks, I would not hesitate to buy it over and over again! A little definitely goes a long way and the results are undeniable. My baby bump is a-growin&#x27;, but the strech marks are not a-showin&#x27;. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> one bottle needed faster than 2 weeks using 1-2 times a day, so it&#x27;s for two weeks to use once a day.</li>
    <li> I have a six month old daughter and while I was pregnant I got tons of stretch marks. I gained about 60lbs. I&#x27;ve tried every cream you can think of to lighten up my stretch marks but nothing worked. This however did work for me and now you can&#x27;t even see my stretch marks. LOVE this product! I also received this product before the expected delivery time. Which I was very satisfied and surprised about b/c thats never happened before with other sellers. This is a must buy from this seller!!!</li>
    <li> So I was looking REALLY hard to find an honest review that seemed real and not too one sided. I have used two tubes of this, I am 23 weeks pregnant, and im honestly disappointed. Ive used this stuff 3-4 times a day on my breasts, stomach, sides. I got stretch marks on all 3 and I waited to write a review until I saw anything on my belly, after all stretch marks on the breasts can just happen because of a not very supportive spots bra. So a few days ago I got some faint ones on my belly but their getting worse. Works different for all people, but if you dont wanna take a chance like I did. Try something else.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait until the end of my pregnancy to write a review. My entire family got stretch marks (bad ones). Call me vain but I was terrified at the thought of stripes all over me. I started using revitol at month 3 of my pregnancy and I used it twice a day sometimes once if I forgot it in the morning. I was only pregnant for 35 weeks so I missed that 5 weeks where you get huge fast. I do not have one stretch mark on my belly. I did however not think that my thighs would get stretch marks so I got them there  I did not put revitol on my thighs). I have been using the rest of my revitol on my thighs for the last 10 days and they are nearly gone. I also had people touch my belly and comment on how smooth it was. I never had and itchy belly which I have heard many women complain about. I WILL buy this for my next pregnancy and really believe it is the reason I do not have stretch mark because trust me the rest of the ladies in the family do.</li>
    <li> Its does not absorb as i had expected. When you take a shower the next morning you can feel the cream wash away. Its to early to see results so I will let you know when i do.</li>
    <li> I really hoped that this cream will help a little bit, but NO it doesnt work at all so do NOT buy this thinking ur strech mark will be reduce somehow because you will be very disapointed!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the same Revitol product from this store and their order is fulfilled in a timely manner and have had no problems.  Would definitely recommend.  I have never had to deal with customer service as the merchandise has always arrived on time and in great condition.  And the price is good as well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product upon finding out I was pregnant with my first child to prevent stretch marks. My mother got stretch marks so I was leery that I&#x27;d end up with stretch marks anyway. I put on everyday up to giving birth and I never got stretchmarks, but I don&#x27;t know if it was the lotion or genetics. It definitely keeps your skin nice and supple a lot longer than any other lotion I tried. I loved that, but my morning sickness started to make the smell of it almost unbearable. But I keept applying it and enjoyed the softness it gave my skin. I would recommend this product and use it again when I have my second child.</li>
    <li> I received my order fast and love this product.  This product is the ONLY thing that has helped prevent stretch marks while being pregnant, I highly recommend to everyone who is looking for the perfect stretch mark cream.</li>
    <li> only thing that seems to make a difference with my fair skin. I know that my stretch markers will never go away but this does help a great deal.</li>
    <li> I ordered two small tubes and it took over a week to get delivered.  I also wished they had a satisfaction guaranteed return policy.</li>
    <li> Worked with my last pregnancy, no stretch marks and not oily, love this product and am now using it on this pregnancy!</li>
    <li> SHOULD BE 0 STARS -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did not improve my Stretch Marks one bit!&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the $$$!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give lots of Great reviews for Products but this is NOT one&lt;br /&gt;of them! I tried BOTH bottles too. It&#x27;s been about 2 Months since&lt;br /&gt;giving Birth! No change!</li>
    <li> I really liked this cream.  I just finished my pregancy and thankfully made it through without a single stretch mark.  Most stretch mark crems have a very funny smell and this one has a tiny odd odor but minor.      Disclaimer (only reason i didnt give it 5 stars):  I m not totally sold if the stretch mark cream market is 100% legit.  I hear either you get them or you dont but i didn&#x27;t want to chance it.  I used a different brand, mustella, last pregnancy and only got 1 minor stretch mark so i may just not be as proned to getting them.  I also thankfully don&#x27;t gain a ton of weight which i think helps significantly too.  either way, i would recommend this cream.</li>
    <li> i have been buying this cream for almost a year in revitol.com trying to save some money got this they smell awful and don&#x27;t have the same consistency than the ones I got before I don&#x27;t know if they are fake or old if you are getting some from here save your money and get them in revitol.com</li>
    <li> The cream has no bad scent. It is very good, doesn&#x27;t mess up your clothing once you apply it correctly. I love it! Still on my 1st tube after one month.</li>
    <li> Works really well, I&#x27;ve only been using for a week and can see changes in color of stretch marks</li>
    <li> I used this product all throughout my pregnancy and I STILL got stretch marks. The only thing I can say positive is that my stretch marks are not as bad but I wish I would have used Bio Oil instead.</li>
    <li> Stretch marks run in my family. Both of my sisters have severe stretch marks. I assumed that would also happen to me as we have the same skin type and genetics. After reading studies and hundreds of reviews all over the Internet, I decided it was worth a try, so I purchased a 6-bottle pack.  I used it religiously twice a day starting at 3 months into my pregnancy with my first child.  Even though I gained over 50 pounds, I remained stretch mark free! I give it 4 stars due to the fact that 6 bottles was not adequate, so I had to purchase an additional 2 bottles. I guess you could say I used a lot of it, but well worth it. I highly recommend this product, and I&#x27;ll be purchasing it again today for my 2nd pregnancy!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not work I expected.</li>
    <li> It is not like advertising that effect for white stretch mark.&lt;br /&gt;But for Red one, It works</li>
    <li> Does NOT work. Stay away</li>
    <li> This product is living up to its reputation, is widely used by average joes and celebs alike to reduce and prevent stretch marks (particularly during pregnancy, which is my personal reason for using it). I am pleased with the results thus far.  Reasonable price makes this a worthy investment.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews, I decided to give it try to Revitol. Purchased to bottles right away, but they sent me only one. After couples of emails, they refunded my money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a first application, i did not like the smell of this product! Smelly cream! I havent used them at all, such a waste of money! Insted tried Bio-Oil, they are great!!! I had this awful red stretch mark for about a year, and after a few application of Bio-Oil they disappeared!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 3rd pregnancy and I&#x27;ve used this product for all three. I&#x27;ve read that creams don&#x27;t help with stretch marks that it is geneic but this product has worked for me and I&#x27;m about out so will be ordering more. I did research before ordering and found before and after photos so I believe it really works.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I expected, but made skin soft.</li>
</ol>
