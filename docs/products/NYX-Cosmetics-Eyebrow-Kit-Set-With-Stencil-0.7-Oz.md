<li> The 2 light powders are useless to me...</li>
<li> The stencil didn&#x27;t stay flat and fill in color was so loose that you can&#x27;t tell you put anything on.</li>
<li> the box came with the product open and it&#x27;s missing a brush from inside</li>
<li> Colors too dark for my brows.</li>
<li> I mean, who has so big eyebrows??</li>
<li> I tried this stencils in my friends and for all of us these are too big, and the one with an aceptable size is too thin.</li>
<li> and it is not easy to use.  </li>
<li> I used the medium brown and the small stencil</li>
<li> The case is small, sturdy, and has a mirror for the on-the-go touch-ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Ive used this kit for the past 3 years.</li>
<li> Or mines are small?</li>
<li> I just found the stencils a tad bit hard to work with.  </li>
<li> Hard to do with one hand.</li>
<li> The mirror in compact was broken in little pieces, so not good, but kit o.k.</li>
<li> Stencil are very hard to make stick</li>
<li> Bought this because I have thinner, overplucked eyebrows, but not overly thin.</li>
<li> If you have sparse or thin brows</li>
<li> The powder &amp; powder Brush work but the stencil are useless ,there is no way you can pluck your eyebrows with stencils on.</li>
<li> Sorry.</li>
<li> its almost like really bad eyeshadow.</li>

    <li> Colors too dark for my brows. Stencil are very hard to make stick but they don&#x27;t so I&#x27;m always holding them in place, horrinlt</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with this product. The colors can blend really well. It does look natural.</li>
    <li> Nice shapes and colors in this particular kit - Reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Nice little kit for the price.</li>
    <li> Did not work well. The stencil didn&#x27;t stay flat and fill in color was so loose that you can&#x27;t tell you put anything on. its almost like really bad eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> the box came with the product open and it&#x27;s missing a brush from inside</li>
    <li> This is and almost good product BUT, stencils are too big, I mean, who has so big eyebrows?? Or mines are small? I tried this stencils in my friends and for all of us these are too big, and the one with an aceptable size is too thin. So unless your eyebrow is oversized do not buy it. The brushes are fine as well as the shades of color.</li>
    <li> Bought this because I have thinner, overplucked eyebrows, but not overly thin. I wanted something to help me fill them in a bit. The stencils are huge, I am talking... like Bert huge. The powder is ok. I just use the powder to try to fill in my brows the best I can. It works nicely. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again because of the stencils, but would totally buy the powder separately. The 2 light powders are useless to me...as I have brown hair. If I could recommend something, I would say just buy the color powder you need and get a brush to apply. This way you dont have colors that you cant use. If someone wants my stencils, talk to Ernie.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!!!!!!  It took a while to get it but I really do like it.</li>
    <li> Very simple to use.  Would have liked more colors to choose from in the set, but overall was quite satisfied.</li>
    <li> It would work better if we&#x27;re in a eyeliner or gel chemical instead of powder but the shapes are perfect</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviews--I was looking forward to trying the brow stencils and the shapes and sizes seem to be pretty far off, either very small or very large.</li>
    <li> Great product. My daughter and I both use it. Price was right, quality spot in. Bought on Prime, received promptly. Will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> Ive used this kit for the past 3 years. I love it and will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> very good quality, and pigmentation and wonderful. I can not say not a bad point about this product. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> my eyebrows look much more natural using this.&lt;br /&gt;Its soft looking, and for once my eyebrows do NOT look powdery.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s a turn off.&lt;br /&gt;FIVE STARS.</li>
    <li> Best eyebrow product I have ever purchased.  I don&#x27;t like using the stencils, so I just free hand mine.  But I love it.</li>
    <li> My favorite eyebrow kit to date.  I love that you have a stencil and brushed included with this kit and I sometimes use the colors for eyeshadows when I want a matte look.  Therefore you get a three in one with this product! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This product is very helpful for me because I have very light brows. Having a template makes it easier to&lt;br /&gt;extend the brows so that they look natural.</li>
    <li> This product was easy to use even as an amateur. The variety of colors offered in this kit allowed me to blend and match my natural color eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Colors are great.  I just found the stencils a tad bit hard to work with.  They slipped.  Hard to do with one hand.</li>
    <li> This product is okay and if you get it for a good price then it is fine.  The stencils are big and in my opinion cumbersome.  I haven&#x27;t been able to use the stencils.  But they are a soft plastic and very sturdy would be easy to wipe clean.  You get four shadows and a comb and makeup brush very tiny for both,  beware there is no eyebrow wax in this product.  If you want a efficient cheap kit go to walmart and buy the NYC eyebrow kit.  You get the wax and the powder and a tweezers and brush.  You can always buy stencils separately. I don&#x27;t recommend for the price  and it is not easy to use.  Sorry.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The stencils are a perfect length to frame your eyes, varied in width from modest to ultra glam and they&#x27;re a nice soft thick plastic that I can see will last. I got a nice clean line with the stencils and can use any of the colors alone or blend for a perfect match. The application brush is a perfect size and nicely chiselled for the job. The brush/comb combination for taming the brows is a also perfect for the job. The case is small, sturdy, and has a mirror for the on-the-go touch-ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Only that the kit doesn&#x27;t come with a wax but I used clear mascara to seal the deal so that&#x27;s not a biggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the NYX Cosmetics Eyebrow Kit Set with Stencils if you want to get a nice, professional look for your eyebrows!</li>
    <li> The mirror in compact was broken in little pieces, so not good, but kit o.k. The stencils shape are good.</li>
    <li> Stencils are Huge, unless you have a big face you will not be able to use them</li>
    <li> I think the best way to describe this product is to first say that it makes you r eyebrows look like they were professionally done if you do it right and make sure you have some type of arch or your eyebrows are some what cleaned up just so you can have that great arch look eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I have used many brow pencils to fill in my light sparse brows.  They have all looked &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34;.  I was once asked if my brows were tattooed!  I stopped using that pencil immediately!  I wanted this mainly for the stencils as I am using a brow growth formula and wanted a good stencil for application.  The stencils are great!  There are 3 sizes to choose from.  I was really impressed with the kit, it comes with everything.  I used the medium brown and the small stencil and I love the result!  Even when my brows fill in, I will continue to use the brow kit to shape, fill and perfect my brows.  Love it!  Great seller.  Product arrived on time and was in perfect condition!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> The powder &amp; powder Brush work but the stencil are useless ,there is no way you can pluck your eyebrows with stencils on.</li>
    <li> good product and fast shipment</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for the stencils myself but it comes with a nice array of colors..&lt;br /&gt;I am olive skin with brown eyes and it works perfect for me..</li>
    <li> I have really thick eyebrows and these stencils are perfect. If you have sparse or thin brows these will not work for you.</li>
    <li> The kit feels so cheap, and the powder is just cheap, the stencil isn&#x27;t that good either.. i wish i didn&#x27;t buy it</li>
