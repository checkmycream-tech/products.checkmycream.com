      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>So I decided I needed to check and make sure they were all there.</li>
      <li>Love these.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using these towels for years. I always had better results with towels than the lotions as far as applying the product it goes on more evenly for me than lotions.We all know these tanning products have same ingredients in them i just prefer the towels more convient for me and i dont seem to have the streaking problems as i do with the lotions.</li>
    <li> These are great Im fair skinned and freckled. The trick is to do small parts at a time and then rub in and even. I do one starting from the top of my hand to my shoulder and them I rub in circular motions while still wet. Then I do underneath my arm as well. I use them on my arms and legs but you can use them all over. It takes a few times for practice but the color is great very easy to apply and it doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes or sheets.</li>
    <li> My roommate tried these towelettes as soon as they arrived.  She got a great color and was very happy.  I tried them, but got next to no color except on my heels.  I will try them again before I make a final judgement.  Different skin tones will have different results.  I will say the wipes are very thin so we had to use 2 each.  Not sure if this will be a bargin over the more expensive ones (only had to use one)in the long run.  I would definately encourage people to try them.</li>
    <li> This product works very well. It is so much easier than using lotions or gels. The customer service I received from Bargain Defender was also excellent. Half of my original package was stolen upon receipt (at the fault of the receiving address not Bargain Defender), but Bargain Defender replaced the missing product anyway with no hassle. Shipment was very fast.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. It is so easy to apply and the color looks so nautural. I recommend this product for anyone who likes a little color to their skin.</li>
    <li> Just applied last night; the color is pretty natural for a fake tan on my Asian skin! I like that it doesn&#x27;t have that self tanner smell that most have.  But one towel doesn&#x27;t cover the whole body (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3\\&quot;/140lbs). I had to use two to get the lower body/legs.  (They do have the body sized towels, but I bought the normal size). Will see how long it lasts between applications; says to re-apply every 3-4 days to maintain color.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband years ago for him to try.  Since he&#x27;s fair skinned, he doesn&#x27;t like to lay in the sun because he burns so easy.  Needless to say, he loved it!  It only takes a couple of hours for the tan to appear and never streaks or has that orangey fake look!  He will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> Commodynes are wonderfully convenient, easy to use and effective. Application is easy - just be careful to watch where you apply to be sure all areas are covered. The color change is gradual and natural. There is a mild smell to the towelettes but that is just the nature of this type of product.  The scent is not overwhelming and fades quickly. Once the product dries, it does not come off on clothing. One of the best effects of this product, as compared to the others I&#x27;ve tired, is that this one also fades gradually and naturallly.  Others have been blotchy after a few days. I&#x27;m sticking with Commodynes and you should too!</li>
    <li> the towelet this product uses is of an odd material and it goes to tatters before you can cover your body with the tanning product</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few years.  My original supply ran out and I started to look for a reorder source. My original source no longer carried them so I was thrilled to find them at Amazon. They are easy to use, very natural color and perfect in the spring when the weather calls for tan legs, the sun doesn&#x27;t cooperate and there&#x27;s no time for a tanning bed.  Use these three or so hours prior to an event or just before you go to bed and presto....tan legs in the morning!!</li>
    <li> Can tell you it doesn&#x27;t go on evenly. Had to buy sunless tanning spray to touch up. And everyone was right about the wipes being difficult to use, they do tend to roll up on you while using very annoying. Can tell you that it doesn&#x27;t make you look like your that awful orange color and it doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes, but that the only good think about them, surely not worth $50</li>
    <li> Great item,this is the 2nd summer i am using this product no orange pigment to the skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for over a year now and have never used anything that even compares! I have stopped getting $20 weekly spray tans because of how much better these towelettes work. AND they smell really good-not some digusting perfumy smell, just a light sweet smell. I even have my husband hooked on these things for a subtle glow that just looks like you were out in the sun for an afternoon. The Intensive is where you get an actual bronze, dark \\&quot;tan\\&quot;. These Natural towelettes are so easy to use, I start with my face and work down. Just use them methodically so you don&#x27;t miss any places and you will be fine. I do wish each towelette was a little larger since they are about $2 each but since I can&#x27;t find anything that would ever replace these, I certainly would never stop using them!</li>
    <li> Comodynes self-tanning toweletes has worked wonders on my body--especially my face, arms, and legs!  The moist towel is more than enough to get your entire face, chest, and arms....and it dries in seconds so you can get dressed a few minutes after applying.  It doesnt have that nasty fake bake odor, and your glow will develop in 2 to 3 hours and last for 3 to 4 days!    I have oily skin prone to breakouts, but Comodynes has caused not one single problem with my face.  I buy the pack of thirty because if you use a towelette every 4 days then you will be tan 365 days per year!  One thing--to properly tan your leg you will need one full towelette for each leg, but it sure beats getting skin cancer in a tanning bed!    This is truly a miracle product!</li>
    <li> I love these towlettes!  2 days Before any special occasion or vacation use the towelettes.  After the first day you will notice any spots you may have missed.  Doesn&#x27;t make you orange and great for pale skin.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much.  It is easy to apply and gives a nice natural looking tan. The clean up is especially easy as well.</li>
    <li> I love this product. However I ordered a package of 30. When I opened my Amazon box I noticed 5 of the towelettes had been shoved in to the opposite side of the plastic box that the others were in.  So I decided I needed to check and make sure they were all there. I only relieved 26 instead of the 30 I was supposed to. I&#x27;m not sure if this has happened before or just to me. Needless to say I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> love this product.  it is so natural looking and I have been asked by several people where I had been on vacation,  Best self tanner on the market.    Lynne</li>
    <li> I agree with the ease of use and quick drying but the color is TERRIBLE!!! It is just too Orange....just horrible! I will not buy this again. I have medium skin tone and this made me orange in one application and it takes 3 of these to cover your body, not 2...unless you are 5 foot tall...NOT RECOMENDED AT ALL</li>
    <li> We love these towlettes and they arrived when promised.</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous..! This is the 3rd time that I have ordered it and each time it is super.!! I am from Florida and do not have time to tan...these towelettes can be applied on clean skin morning, noon or evening..it does take 3 to 5 hours to get to the max tan, but if it is not enough, reapply at that time or the next day, and it will be awesome..!!  Good luck !! love it!!  Cherie from Florida</li>
    <li> I have been using these self tanning wipes for years.  They are easy to use and after the first use the tan is very slight and not overwhelming. However, I usually use them again the next day or 2 days later for a deeper tan.  The deeper tan is a very natural look of color.  People always ask me where did I go???</li>
    <li> This was a very quick and accurate delivery, although the product experation date says april 2007 which gave me two weeks to use 30 tanning towelettes (impossible).</li>
    <li> I have been using Comodynes self-tanning towelettes for two years.  This product is quick and easy to use and gives me a healthy-looking, natural complexion.  Especially helpful in the winter season!</li>
    <li> These tanning towlettes work great. They do not make you look orange. I also can use them on my face and they do not break me out.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It provides a gorgeous natural looking golden tan, after about two uses even to my very fair skin. Be careful to let it dry for a few hours before going out. It may seem like it dries quickly, but the skin hasn&#x27;t completely absorbed it and is still susceptible to water and the like. This size is overpriced on Amazon compared to the Comodynes website where a 30 pack is only $45.. just be aware.</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice a week for 4 weeks and there is absolutly no change in my skin tone, Have used the Kate Summerville 8 pack with more tanning. Kates towelettes were 8 for 48.00 while this product had 30 for 48.00. Guess I should have figured that one out. First time I have been unhappy with an Amazon order. Fran Kober</li>
    <li> I normally use Bare Escentuals sunless tanner which is awesome!!!! But, sometimes it gets monotonous using a brush to smooth on all over, so I saw this and thought I would try the tanning towelettes instead, since it looked so much quicker. I have used sunless tanning products for yrs. and am very adept at application, and although the Comodynes towels were quicker to apply, the quality was just not there.  The towelette kept bunching and pilling up and dried out very quickly so I had to use 2 to 3 tanning towels for coverage over my entire body.  Also, and this is the biggie, the color turned my skin orange and the product left streaks that took a while to fade off!!!!! And I know the importance of good exfoliation prior to sunless tanning to maximize results.  Plz don&#x27;t waste your money on this one. Bare Escentuals sunless tanner and Kate Somerville have products that are much better for a natural looking color and streakfree application.</li>
    <li> nice color, even coverage, no streaking, and no smell like most self tanners.</li>
    <li> The quality of the tan these wipes provides is pretty decent and fairly even.  I&#x27;m extremely fair skinned and it came out pretty natural looking.  It did, however, take 3 towels to get my whole body and I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5&amp;#34;, 120 lbs.  I like the portability of them, I took a few with me on vacation to touch up my tan and they take up very little room in luggage.  I wish you could see where you apply it but all in all, they are a good tanning wipe.</li>
    <li> It came opened as with missing towlettes. How can it be?&lt;br /&gt;I payed for the 30 pack....and should have received that amount.</li>
    <li> I have been using Comodynes tanning towels for the past 8 years, yes, that long! I love this product! If I have an event coming up and need a tan, I will use them every night for 3-4 days and I&#x27;ve noticed I&#x27;m only streaky the first day and that&#x27;s only if I&#x27;m not careful. I&#x27;m rather fair with blonde hair and blue eyes so I&#x27;m familiar with other tanners that have an orange look, this product does not have that affect on my skin. 2 towels does the trick and I&#x27;ve developed a system over the years that works best for me. Also, they don&#x27;t stink like most of the others out there. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This brand of tanning towels gives quick results on the first use.  You can \\&quot;build a tan\\&quot; and have the perfect tan after 2-3 towels.  This product goes on evenly, dries quickly and does not get on your clothing or bedsheets (if you are tanning overnight).  This product is wonderful for people who just don&#x27;t have the time to wait for creams or gels to dry.  GREAT alternative to tanning beds.  I give this product a perfect score!!!</li>
    <li> I have to admit these are the best self-tanners I&#x27;ve ever used.  This will be my 3rd year using these, but every time I place an order the price goes up. I&#x27;m placing my last order to get me through this summer but will be looking for a new more cost effective product for next summer.  If price isn&#x27;t an issue then these are the way to go.</li>
    <li> I use these tan towels all year long, on my face,  instead of make-up...They never streak...they never  make you look orangey...they don&#x27;t come off on  your clothes...or bedding...they are the best...</li>
    <li> I was skeptical a year ago when I started using it. Surprisingly, it only takes 2 towelettes to do my whole body... (one for my head to waist, and the other to do waist to toes). If you have a simple base tan, this enhances it to a beautiful bronze tan. I touch-up ever 3 or 4 days. I have tried MANY other brands... this one doesn&#x27;t give me the age-old brown elbows, knees, or ankles. I can wear clothes 5 minutes after using it and it doesn&#x27;t stain a thing! I stick them in my bags when I travel. I recomend to everyone that wants a great, EASY product; try this!</li>
    <li> These are great! The color and evenness is like another brand in silver packets which must&#x27;ve changed formulas (as the orange &amp; white packets) were never the same. I had used them (silver packets) nfor years.  I had also tried the drugstore tanning towels but they made me orange and my legs were very streaky! I, then, came back to the Comodynes &amp; am so happy to look like a Floridian with a tan. I will no longer expose myself to the sun as I once did. Two (facial) skin cancer removals (lip and eye area) did it for me!</li>
    <li> Love these!  I have used these for years!  They work great!  I love using one of these and then topping off with St. Tropez self-tanning lotion.  You look like you have a perfect tan (not too dark, and not too light) within a couple of hours.</li>
    <li> The color comes in fine after a few hours, if you moisturize first.  But the towels roll up in your hand when you try to apply the product.  Very inconvenient.  I have resigned myself to just using them for my face.</li>
    <li> Great product and service of course.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! IT DOESN&#x27;T LEAVE ANY STREAKS OR ANYTHING (UNLIKE THOSE THAT COME IN A BOTTLE DO).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ALSO LOVE THE FACT THAT ONCE IT&#x27;S DRY AND YOU PUT ON A SHIRT IT DOESN&#x27;T STAIN THE SHIRT SOMETHING THAT (ONCE AGAIN) THE BOTTLE ONES DO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU GET AN INSTANT TAN IN 3 HOURS LIKE THE PACKAGE SAYS. ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE TO USE TWO TOWELETTES, ONE JUST WON&#x27;T DO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M PETITE (5&#x27;2\\&quot;) AND I HAVE TO USE TWO OF THOSE TOWELETTES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M VERY HAPPY THAT I FOUND THIS PRODUCT. THIS IS SO MUCH SAFER THAN A TANNING BED. I WILL DEFINITELY BE ORDERING MORE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A++++ PRODUCT ( SMELLS GREAT TOO!!)</li>
    <li> I have used these for a few years and wouldn&#x27;t use any other self tanning product.</li>
    <li> I purchase a supply each summer.  Does a nice job at giving a subtle tan look without spending time in the sun!</li>
    <li> I have serious &amp;#34;vitaligo&amp;#34; on my face and hands. It is purely cosmetic, but I know people wonder if I got burned somehow and many have asked me that. The towelettes almost completely cover it up. I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product, unless you could somehow make then last all summer!</li>
    <li> I have been using Comodynes Self Tanning towlettes for years ... My son describes me as a &#x27;ginger&#x27; ... I do not tan.  These tanning wipes give me a healthy &#x27;tan-ish&#x27; glow without anything that looks fake.  People almost always comment on how great I look on the days I use these ... and that would be about every third day. LOVE THEM!!!</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THEM LAST YEAR ALSO &amp; WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED.  THIS TIME I DID SOME SHOPPING AROUND AND FOUND THESE ARE A GOOD VALUE.</li>
    <li> These are good to use after you lay out in the sun and keep your suntan longer</li>
    <li> I discovered  Comodynes towelettes a few years ago and love them! Very easy to use, I never have streaks. Sometimes it takes two applications to get the darkness desired (letting the first dry completely, then go back over the area again). I&#x27;m sad that they don&#x27;t sell them in many stores but amazon delivers in a few days. My favorite thing about this product is that the color does not rub off on my clothes when I sweat or go swimming! Thank you for this product, I will continuing ordering it!</li>
    <li> I had tried this product over 3 years ago and could not find it again until this year.  Last year tried to find it and ended up using a different yet similar product.  That product did not obtain the same results and left an odor.  I am so happy to find this product again and cannot wait for its arrival!  I would have to say in using several different self tanning products this by far has the best natural results with ease of use!  It is an A++++ product!</li>
    <li> I am a self-professed self tanning fanatic.  I am not able to get a good tan in the sun, because if I&#x27;m not wearing a high sunscreen I&#x27;ll fry!  I really really wanted to love this product.  The reviews are really good.  I tried, from December until May to make this product work (I ordered 40 towels total). The fact is, these towels are so streaky!  I swear, even when I was super duper careful, there were major streaks on my upper legs.  Ladies, be sure and take a good look at your body in front of a window. natural light does not lie.  The ladies who say no streaks must have some sort of special system that that hasn&#x27;t occurred to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the color is really good.  It is a touch orange on fair skin, but hey, most self tanners are orange what can you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing, the most annoying thing, is how the towels roll up in your hand, even when you take tiny slow strides.  Even then, going upward it rolls up in your hand and you have to un-roll it over and over and its just really annoying for some reason.  Also, it&#x27;s all shredded up by the end.  Please note you will need 2 to do your whole body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, i really wish I loved this product.  I&#x27;m no dummy, I&#x27;ve been self tanning for maybe 10 years so it&#x27;s not due to lack of experience.  I have to say, I won&#x27;t order again, even though the towel concept and color is good.</li>
    <li> Have used Comodynes for several years, but they don&#x27;t seem as effective as they did earlier.  Still a great way to get a little color without&lt;br /&gt;going in the sun, but would like product to be a bit stronger.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years. They are the best tan towel out there. The only reason I did not rate it five stars is because I have to use 3-4 towels over my entire body in order to get a streak-free and even application. That can get costly.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is very easy to apply and I get a natural tanned look without blotches, it does not stain your clothes. Also try the Intensive Self Tanning Towlettes for a deeper tan in summer, without exposing yourself to the dangerous sun rays.</li>
    <li> I love the product, however, the expiration date was Jan, 2014. At that price I expected fresh merchandise, not something on the verge of  expiring!</li>
    <li> My wife loves it since she has a fair complexion.  Good results in just a few hours</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE these wipes!!!!  1 can do face, arms &amp; chest. Another does legs &amp; belly. Natural color with ease. Just great. Have re-ordered several times,</li>
    <li> I have used this product many years and love them. They are soo easy to use. One for the head to my torso, and one for my waste to my feet. It really covers good and I would recommend it to anyone. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have always hated the way my skin looks with out a tan so summer and the beach are among my favorite things!  To keep a base all year long I used the tanning salon...with much guilt.  Then I found these towelettes...they produce GREAT results.  It takes me two to do my whole body, face and limbs.  It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t have that quirky corn syrupy smell  of other \\&quot;tan in a can\\&quot; products.  The color looks like the natural tan I get in the sun...no orangey look at all! I apply it twice a week to maintain a healthy looking tan... Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I discovered Comodynes&#x27; Cosmetic Tanning Towlettes several years ago and used them sparingly.  They are sealed in a foil packet that keeps the towelettes moist for a long time.  Recently, my supply got low and  I searched Amazon.com to see if they had them.  Eureka!  I was happy to find that Comodynes Self-Tanning Towelettes were available on Amazon.com!  By taking your time to cover your skin evenly, you&#x27;ll get a beautiful, even golden tan without the damaging rays of the sun.  I love the idea of not having to sear my skin in the sun and get wrinkles along with a beautiful tan.  It&#x27;s a great option for fair-skinned people. Easy to apply and quick to dry.</li>
    <li> I always purchase this every year.  Looks great when you apply it correctly.</li>
    <li> I like to use Kate Sommerfields line but they are so expensive, so I decided to give this a shot. Some of the other reviews stated that these towels were hard to hold on to, and they certainly are.  They bunch up so easily and you are constantly having to unfold them.  And you will most definitely have to use at least two. I thought oh well, at least I am saving some money, until I saw the finished product on me.  I was totally uneven and streaky. Cannot return them either cause they are open. What a waste of money- I should of spent the extra 30 dollars and stuck with Kate&#x27;s line (those are fantastic). Oh well, live and learn, but to all of you out there, don&#x27;t order these...</li>
    <li> If I could give this product a negative star I would. They are terrible. I am a self tan guru have used Tan Towels, Fake Bake, Sun Laboratories, Clarins, Lancome&#x27; I have tried it all. I purchased this product based on its reviews. Wow what a mistake I should have stuck with my tan towels so much better. The results of this product might be good, if the wipes were better. They seem to curl and roll up when applying making application hard. Due to the product rolling and curling it makes the application not smooth and even hard to apply evenly. If I could return these crappy things I would. $50 down the drain. If you are familiar with self tan avoid these please.</li>
    <li> They give you color but kinda streak so apply carefully.</li>
    <li> Comodynes Self Tanning Towlettes is better than any other product I have tried.  You can apply it in the privacy of your own home.  Take them with you on vacation or a weekend away.  The lotion smells good, giving you a nice even tan when and where you want it.  Apply and dry right there!  It&#x27;s that easy.  No streaking, no bad odors, just a nice quick and convientant tan.  Doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes.  The bonus round is, it last for a couple of weeks.  Great price for a great product.  I tell all that ask about this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I have used these towlettes for 3 years and am very happy with them.  I only used them on my legs but they work well and have a natural color.  I especially love that I can apply it and not have to stand around for 20 minutes waiting for it to dry.  I usually apply if before bedtime and wake up to a warm, natural color.  I&#x27;ve also never had a problem with this product staining clothes or bed sheets. They are so much better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried from a department store.</li>
    <li> I have been self tanning for many years , tried many different products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;There is almost no smell to the towels. It fades quickly and you do not have to worry it interfearing with your parfume.&lt;br /&gt;The towels are a good size, about a large wash clothes. Yes they slightly roll up , if you go to fast, but if you take your time they work just great. To maximum the usage I do not use the whole towel size at once , as I unfold I use it on different portions. You definitely do need one for your upper body, and one for your waste down.&lt;br /&gt;More on the amount of towels below in the cons section.&lt;br /&gt;The application is super easy, super fast. I believe even beginners can work with it, I had NO STREAKING at all.&lt;br /&gt;The more often you use the towels the more  you layer the tan depth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;I actually used 3 towels the first application (after showering, exfoliation(do not use an exfoliator that contains oil! ) and I applied Burts Bee;s radiant lotion (but i believe any other lotion will do)&lt;br /&gt;The next morning I used one more towel all over, the tan got a little richer, but still not to my liking&lt;br /&gt;I have light eyes and dark blond hair, so I am not on the super fair side, but also do not have a natural base tan. Just to give you an idea , as I believe these towels will work different for everyones skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;5 hours later I used another towel , and honestly as I see the tan progress I assume I will use another one to two towels ( remember now , you do not have to use those back to back as I did, but since it was the weekend I took advantage of the time , verses applying more towels over the next 2-3 days as it is suggestet for a deeper tan)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think anyone having used other self tan products, should just be aware of the fact that with this product you will gradually build your tan. on average I expect to have to use at least 8 towels for one application, which I hope will last one week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Willgive an update on how long the tan lasts, I wonder also how it will\\&quot;fade\\&quot; away and if i need to exfoliate after one week, or should apply more towels let&#x27;s say for 10 -12 days before doing so. If anyone already tried it out, please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the only con to me is the price of the towels. If I compare it to tanning salon fees and how much time that took(besides how unhealthy it is) I think I will stick with the towels for a while, but compared to sprays and lotions it is more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: I saw the company also has the same product with a more intense ! color depth. I ordered them today and will see how they will compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck everyone,I really think everyone should at least give these towels a try.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for 8 years now.I have tried cheaper products.These are the best for color and the color lasts for quite a few days.They are great to travel with.Its a winner.</li>
    <li> I loved the results when I used this product last summer, and then I ran out of them. They are a little pricy, so I decided to buy cheaper sunless tanners from Walgreens. I don&#x27;t know why I bothered because I can never find a self tanner that works for me. I bought these again recently and cannot wait to try apply it today and see those results again. These towels do tend to streak, so the key is to rub it in like crazy. Once you get the hang of the application, I think most people will see great results. Love that it dries so quickly and doesn&#x27;t end up looking yellow or orange.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for almost 2 years.  All my friends are surprised to learn I never go in the sun.  We live in Palm Desert and the sun is unrelenting as well as treacherous.  Looking like a dried up prune is not in my future. Comodynes leaves my face, arms and chest with a believable golden tan and I literally glow. Shiny is not for me, just a nice golden tan glow. Great on legs too, and  it lasts.  Apply, toss the cloth, rinse your hands and you&#x27;ll be beaming too. Also, nothing to spill and no greasy mess. I have experienced NO down side to this.Amazon has the best price too.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Very natural color and it doesn&#x27;t streak.  Best self-tanner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I have been using Comodynes tan towels for years.  I love the natural color of tan.  Just right for me.  It stays on with repeated use and does not turn orange.  I come back every year for a new supply.</li>
    <li> I have been self tanning for 13 years.  I am a redhead with fair skin and this product looks very natural. When I was younger I would layout to get just a tint.  Because this works with your skins natural DNA you are the color your suppose to be not orange.  So with any self tanner it takes practice so be patient with yourself, be sure though to go very lightly on hands and feet. Remember you can always add more.</li>
    <li> Exellent Service. I have been using them for years and they do very well,no muss no fuss!</li>
    <li> The tanning towels work very well.  I am able to use one towel per application. Very easy to use and very little streaking if you apply evenly.  Would recommend these for sure.</li>
    <li> the product is great! I love it! it&#x27;s quick and clean, with good scent!&lt;br /&gt;And this 30 pack is pretty convenient!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for approximately 10 years.  It was recommended to me by a friend who used it and liked it.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone as being a product that does what is says.</li>
    <li> This product is so easy to use; leave no after smell and gives a very very natural looking tan.  Love it!</li>
    <li> These are the best tanning wipes ever! I&#x27;ve tried them all - all the sprays, lotions etc.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given these out to several friends and they all end up purchasing a box.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect tan color - no orange or streaks ever</li>
    <li> Works good but it takes a lot of applications</li>
    <li> Great tanning product. Color goes on easily and evenly with the towlette. Color looks like a tan and not orange like so many other tanning products. Been using this product for years. Price is reasonable as well for this 30-towlette package.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a few years now - and would recommend them. The product goes on easy and evenly distributed. I cannot live without these - they are great for arms and face - if you need to cover more area - I would recommend St Tropez foaming mouse. They were delivered quickly  - and I am one happy shopper to have my tanning towelettes!!! Love these!!!</li>
    <li> I buy these every year in the spring just to give my legs a little color without having to lay in the sun.  I start out applying twice a week and then after a month just once a week.  The 30 pak lasts for months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for the first time and still learning. I didn&#x27;t moisturize my entire body before using and I missed a few spots so that was my fault. Tip I learned: take it slow and make sure you don&#x27;t miss anything cause it will show up later. It did give me a good shade and I loved the product. It does start to roll up when it starts to dry up but that not a big deal.</li>
    <li> this product is the best tanning product i have ever used.  the color is so natural.  i get so many nice comments on my tan, and people are shocked when i tell them it&#x27;s not real!</li>
    <li> Great look of a tan, not orange.</li>
    <li> These towlettes are very easy to use.  They give a great, natural-looking color. I have never seen any streaks.  They don&#x27;t give a dark color (use more than one if that is what you want; I have never done that however).  I am very fair skinned and so too dark would look unnatural.  Gives me just enough glow to cut the stark whiteness of my skin.  Highly recommend for the very fair.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd summer using them.  So easy to apply, no mess and Best Of All - NO STREAKS!!!  Love these.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love them!!!</li>
    <li> Very good . Use this first .</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product! No harful rays that cause cancer...no streaking...great price when bought in bulk! Thank you</li>
