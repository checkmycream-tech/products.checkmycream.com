      <li>Lovely, lovely aroma, first time to enjoy this specific Thymes candle, and I must share that I&#x27;ve come to love the Thymes aromatic candles, as I have purchased several different ones by now --- can&#x27;t go wrong investing in one of these.</li>
      <li>Super fragrant and fills up my entire 1500 square foot home!</li>
      <li>The candle burns cleanly and lasts a long time.  </li>
      <li>Have purchased Thymes candles in the past for their lovely frangrance.  </li>
      <li>I light it on my most stressful days and sit in a quiet room and breath deeply as the stress slowly melts</li>
      <li>This is the most delectable fragrance candle I&#x27;ve found lately.  </li>
      <li>A little pricey with my budget but worth it.  </li>

<li> A waste of money!</li>
<li> Very disappointing.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed.</li>

    <li> Just like the body wash and the lotion, the candle smells as beautiful too. You won&#x27;t want to leave your room after this candle. It&#x27;s like being in a spa, beautifully refreshing smell.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom for mother&#x27;s day and she loved it. You almost don&#x27;t even need to light the candle for the smell to fill the room. Great price for it too!</li>
    <li> I have been enjoying this candle for almost 20 years.  It smells absolutely delicious.  My mother loves them too, and I often give it as a present.  I recently ordered one that was damaged during delivery, and the guys over at \\&quot;fine gifts soaps\\&quot; sent us a new one, free of charge, even though I had thrown it away before having taken a photo (my bad).  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Expensive for the size - next time Yankee will get the money for a similar scent - just bigger.  Very nice glass cup it comes in.</li>
    <li> Havent burned yet, however - the candle itself smells amazing! Saving to use in our guest room for house-guests this weekend. The glass is beautiful, Id like to save it once the candle is finished.</li>
    <li> Nice candle that burns well and smells nice, but it is just a candle. It was a gift for my wife who wanted it, so she is very happy. In my frugal humble opinion it is grossly overpriced</li>
    <li> Have purchased Thymes candles in the past for their lovely frangrance.  This candle had little frangrance - must be a misfit/throw-away.  Not sure I would purchase from this buyer again.</li>
    <li> This is the most delectable fragrance candle I&#x27;ve found lately.  There are other fragrances in the Thymes collection but I&#x27;m super-sold on the Eucalyptus.  The candle burns cleanly and lasts a long time.  The price offered through Amazon is also a treat compared to what I&#x27;ve paid in gift stores and boutiques.  I have used this candle as a &amp;#34;just because&amp;#34; gift or hostess gift as well as treating myself too.  I have also loved Thymes Eucalyptus Body Lotion for years.  These products are a cut above and are very special.</li>
    <li> Where have you been all my life??!!!  What a clean, fresh smelling candle. I love (luv!) the smell of eucalyptus. A little pricey with my budget but worth it.  Nice detail on the candle too.</li>
    <li> My favorite candle ever!  It arrived within the designated timeframe.  It was well packed to prevent breakage.  I was very pleased overall!</li>
    <li> The wax didn&#x27;t melt evenly.  A waste of money!</li>
    <li> love it, wish it was bigger</li>
    <li> I love this Thymes scent in every product they offer this scent in.  Love that I can smell the fragrance from outside of the box.  Super fragrant and fills up my entire 1500 square foot home!</li>

    <li> I love this Eucalyptus candle, the scent is divine! It&#x27;s worth every penny. I light it on my most stressful days and sit in a quiet room and breath deeply as the stress slowly melts away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine a candle that brings you peace, It just doesn&#x27;t get any better.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait to open my door when I get home.&lt;br /&gt;The clean fresh scent of Eucalyptus greets me and relaxes the core of me.&lt;br /&gt;Making me human again and ready to enjoy my refuge from the storm of life.</li>
    <li> Purchased this Eucalyptus candle directly from Thymes expecting the wonderful fragrance I get from their lotions. I was very disappointed. The candle gives of no aroma at all. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Lovely, lovely aroma, first time to enjoy this specific Thymes candle, and I must share that I&#x27;ve come to love the Thymes aromatic candles, as I have purchased several different ones by now --- can&#x27;t go wrong investing in one of these.</li>
