      <li>its so refreshing.</li>
      <li>The odor was just ok.</li>
      <li>The bar is solid and a perfect size for what you pay.  </li>
      <li>I came across Plantlife products when I was looking for some aromatherapy candles (which I bought from them and I deeply love).  </li>
      <li>Ive tried so many scents of the products from this company</li>
      <li>So if you&#x27;re thinking of switching to herbal soaps to treat your skin to the best, most natural clean possible--try some Plantlife soaps.  </li>
      <li>All the soaps I bought have the wonderful fragrances I expected when I picked them out - peppermint, lavendar, etc., but I love the Cassia Clove smell - it has a unique earthy smell, but is not overpowering at all.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased and used many Plantlife soaps and am never disappointed.  </li>
      <li>The clove aroma is strong if that is what you are looking for.  </li>
      <li>The warm aroma calms me and makes me feel peaceful.</li>
      <li>This product arrived quickly and is even better than I hoped it would be.  </li>
      <li>They make fabulous gifts to add to gift baskets for friends and family.</li>
      <li>And ALWAYS they send you a free sample of something</li>
      <li>It makes me and the whole bathroom smell amazing.</li>
      <li>Great lasting power, and suds up well.</li>
      <li>Admittedly, since beginning to use Plantlife&#x27;s soaps, my husband is NOT eczema free...</li>
      <li>The lather is rich and creamy.</li>
      <li>Their excellent products are all natural and last for months.  </li>
      <li>Actually makes you smell good throughout the day, gets you squeaky clean, and doesnt leave any sort of soapy residue.</li>
      <li>This soap really doesn&#x27;t smell like clove, it&#x27;s more of an earthy perfume sort of scent.</li>
      <li>And it is so mild on the skin.</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping and the even sent a sample of another soap to try!</li>
      <li>I bought this soap for my husband and the first time he used it to wash his hands, I walked into the bathroom and the scent was heavenly!  </li>
      <li>Favorite natural soap.</li>
      <li>incredible fragrance, long lasting.  </li>
      <li>I am hooked on all of these soaps and have started purchasing many of the different products that Plantlife makes.</li>
      <li>Will definitely purchase more in the line.</li>
      <li>and I keep coming back for more of this one!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>It is gentle, but leaves your skin feeling clean and fresh and very soft.  </li>
      <li>Unusual fragrance, still trying to decide if I like it.</li>
      <li>i would much rather it be rectangular than square.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve smelled pretty much their whole line (Berry, Green tea, Patchoulli, Cedar Sage, Sandlewood, Lavendar, etc), and in my opinion, the top two soaps are Cassia Clove and Vanilla Orange, by far!!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not practical for me to pay $5 bucks for one bar of soap that doesn&#x27;t last, but it&#x27;s a lovely occasional treat.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend all of their soaps.  </li>
      <li>When you lather it on, it glides across your skin without a whole lot of foam and fuss, but you can still see a trail of the natural oils that it is made from.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about Plantlife soaps.      </li>
      <li>Definitely a 5-star soap, but I had to give it 4 stars because it melts away so quickly that the thrill doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
      <li>i bought this out of curiosity and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>For years, we&#x27;d tried keeping him on soaps designed for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>When I received the candles I got two small free samples - this soap and a bottle of lavendar oil.  </li>
      <li>While this would generally calm flare-ups slightly, it wouldn&#x27;t prevent them from creeping up again.  </li>
      <li>I came to natural soaps for a very specific reason--a husband whose eczema was virtually out of control.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also not harsh on the skin like some other natural soaps that I have tried.</li>
      <li>My sensitive skin gets pampered by this soap, and the scent stays on my skin long after the shower.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been on a spa-at-home kick lately and particularly interested in natural spa products.  </li>

<li> The smell reminds me of Christmas, year &#x27;round.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d be willing to bet that if you returned to \\&quot;normal,\\&quot; store-bought soaps afterwards, you&#x27;d do so grudgingly and reluctantly!</li>
<li> they&#x27;re delicately done, not over-powering or too \\&quot;perfume-y.\\&quot;    </li>

    <li> You will want to eat it instead of bathe with it it smells so good! Another will buy again from me on this soap!</li>
    <li> I bought this soap for my husband and the first time he used it to wash his hands, I walked into the bathroom and the scent was heavenly!  (I made him slice me off a sliver since I&#x27;d only bought one in this scent.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased and used many Plantlife soaps and am never disappointed.  Their excellent products are all natural and last for months.  I highly recommend all of their soaps.  They make fabulous gifts to add to gift baskets for friends and family.</li>

    <li> This soap really doesn&#x27;t smell like clove, it&#x27;s more of an earthy perfume sort of scent. It&#x27;s very unique, for the great price, give it a try. I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Picked this up at a health foods store...I&#x27;ve become a huge fan of Plantlife items!  Cassia Clove is a good option for men, since it has a musky, spicy smell to it, though I use it as well and I&#x27;m a chick.  I&#x27;ve smelled pretty much their whole line (Berry, Green tea, Patchoulli, Cedar Sage, Sandlewood, Lavendar, etc), and in my opinion, the top two soaps are Cassia Clove and Vanilla Orange, by far!!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this soap!!! The smell reminds me of Christmas, year &#x27;round. The warm aroma calms me and makes me feel peaceful. The lather is rich and creamy.

    <li> This is a good soap with a strong cinnamon aroma. I, and friends, agree there is no hint of clove scent. If you specifically want clove aroma, as I did, this is not it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered from Plantlife several times.  And ALWAYS they send you a free sample of something, they&#x27;re super fast and everything is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about Plantlife soaps.      I came to natural soaps for a very specific reason--a husband whose eczema was virtually out of control.

The scents of Plantlife&#x27;s soaps are remarkably pleasant too.  I&#x27;ve yet to find one that is offensive to my nose--they&#x27;re delicately done, not over-powering or too \\&quot;perfume-y.\\&quot;    So if you&#x27;re thinking of switching to herbal soaps to treat your skin to the best, most natural clean possible--try some Plantlife soaps.  If you&#x27;re simply looking for some aromatherapy or some way to mix-up your usual soap routine--try some Plantlife soaps.  I&#x27;d be willing to bet that if you returned to \\&quot;normal,\\&quot; store-bought soaps afterwards, you&#x27;d do so grudgingly and reluctantly!</li>
    <li> this is some great soap.  i bought this out of curiosity and was pleasantly surprised.  incredible fragrance, long lasting.  if i were to make any criticism it would be the bars shape.  i would much rather it be rectangular than square.  this would not deter me from buying it again.  a very good quality product.  i will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance, great soap!  Have already reordered for myself and family members.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Cleans well; smells terrific! I cut this in 4&#x27;s so it would last longer. Sampler size is great!</li>
    <li> The clove aroma is strong if that is what you are looking for.  The cake is rather small and doesn&#x27;t last long, so this is soap for those who don&#x27;t mind spending the money.</li>
    <li> This product arrived quickly and is even better than I hoped it would be.  It smells wonderful and using it is a great aromatherapy experience.  I would recommend this product and this seller to anyone!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this soap!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but it has a wonderful aroma.</li>
    <li> hello!&lt;br /&gt; Ive tried so many scents of the products from this company and I keep coming back for more of this one!&lt;br /&gt;It has more a smell of cinnamon in it! its so refreshing. smells really good.  nice scent!</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping and the even sent a sample of another soap to try! Love freebies!</li>
    <li> Love this soap! It makes me and the whole bathroom smell amazing. I will be buying this again in the future.</li>
    <li> Unusual fragrance, still trying to decide if I like it. The soap itself  is nice and non-drying on my skin.</li>
    <li> Favorite natural soap. The scent is just marvelous. And it is so mild on the skin.</li>
    <li> Actually makes you smell good throughout the day, gets you squeaky clean, and doesnt leave any sort of soapy residue. and no harmful chemicals! WIN WIN!</li>
