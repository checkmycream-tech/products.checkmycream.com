### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very happy with it.</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>This is my best friend to my hair ...</li>
      <li>it works awesome on my curly hair! !</li>
      <li>The smell of the product isn&#x27;t that great anymore either.</li>
      <li>great price</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this is a good product</li>
      <li>VERY quick delivery!</li>
      <li>Better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>and you may be inclined to think you need more than the directions say.</li>
      <li>my favorite hair product.</li>
      <li>Love that it&#x27;s a pump you dispense in your hand.</li>
      <li>This stuff, by contrast, is sticky out of the bottle, and more &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t what I need.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff. ...</li>
      <li>I love that this product tames frizzies and keeps my hair heat protected.</li>
      <li>I liked it, but it&#x27;s really just like an oil you&#x27;d add to your hair for styling.  </li>
      <li>I like this product but it shouldn&#x27;t be applied before drying the hair as suggested on the instructions because the hair gets oily really quick.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay - smooth down heat glide discontinued product was better.</li>
      <li>but once I use the blow dryer or hair straightener that coating disappears and I&#x27;m let with smooth,  silky straight hair.</li>
      <li>At first it leaves a lite coating on my hair</li>
      <li>and I love the final result.</li>
      <li>BIG, HUGE, GREASY,FLAT  DIFFERENCE in hair.  </li>
      <li>fast and as described</li>
      <li>wayyyyyy Too thick...but protects hair very well from heat...</li>
      <li>It is very think</li>
      <li>This really makes a difference.</li>
      <li>Ive tried everything to smooth my hair and not make it greasy, and this product totally does the trick!!!</li>
      <li>Sad to see the redken changed their awesome product to something that I can barely stand to use or smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m looking for a new product that is not Redken!</li>
      <li>I use a flat iron regularly and was looking for a product to help keep my hair as healthy as it could be.  </li>
      <li>At home...not quite the same results which proves it&#x27;s me...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand why Redken would discontinue the previous incarnation of this product, Smooth DOWN Heat Glide, when it got rave reviews on so many beauty forums.</li>
      <li>I recommend using a half a pump first to see how much you really need for your hair.</li>
      <li>I was big fan of Smooth Down products and this basically Smooth Down Heat Glide in a new bottle.</li>
      <li>For my dry, coarse, curly hair, the Smooth Down helped to not only add a needed bit of oil and, well, smooth but also helped to neutralize/soften the starchy hairspray (are any of them NOT starchy these days?)</li>
      <li>Love it and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>/&gt;12/13/2016 edit: For those of you who are looking for a similar product to the old version of this product, I&#x27;ve found Matrix biolage deep smoothing serum works really well!</li>
      <li>If you are not used to the product be careful about how much product you distribute in your hair.  </li>
      <li>If your not careful you can make your hair greasy.</li>
      <li>I failed to look at the label when I bought the Smooth LOCK and was surprised that the scent and, especially, texture was different.</li>

<li> It does not seem to protect my hair from breakage due as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
<li> Use on bottom half of hair and then apply to the rest.</li>
<li> Too heavy weighs my hair down</li>
<li> I was looking for something a little lighter, but it did not feel heavy in my hair when I used it.</li>
<li> I have thick wavy hair that is very fine....usually very difficult for me to tame, but this helps 100%</li>
<li> Leaves my hair shiny and bouncy and no more dryness</li>
<li> It&#x27;s of a fairly thick consistency.  </li>
<li> I have thick frizzy hair...</li>
<li> So disappointed and so expensive.</li>
<li> I made my sister and mom try they hate it also</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t even give to someone else because it just looks so horrible.</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why Redken would discontinue the previous incarnation of this product, Smooth DOWN Heat Glide, when it got rave reviews on so many beauty forums. I failed to look at the label when I bought the Smooth LOCK and was surprised that the scent and, especially, texture was different. For my dry, coarse, curly hair, the Smooth Down helped to not only add a needed bit of oil and, well, smooth but also helped to neutralize/soften the starchy hairspray (are any of them NOT starchy these days?) residue on non-wash days. This stuff, by contrast, is sticky out of the bottle, and more &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t what I need. [sigh] In the market for another product....</li>
    <li> Too heavy weighs my hair down</li>
    <li> Great product! VERY quick delivery!</li>
    <li> I am still getting used to this product. It takes me just one or two pumps of the product for my hair and a little goes a long way. If you are not used to the product be careful about how much product you distribute in your hair.  I put the pumps in my hand and rub them together before distributing throughout hair. If your not careful you can make your hair greasy. I love that this product tames frizzies and keeps my hair heat protected.</li>
    <li> I have thick frizzy hair... This is my best friend to my hair ... Better than anything I&#x27;ve tried. I use to straighten or curl</li>
    <li> Kept the frizz from my hair all day. A little goes a long way. Love that it&#x27;s a pump you dispense in your hand.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Leaves my hair shiny and bouncy and no more dryness</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. ...it works awesome on my curly hair! ! At first it leaves a lite coating on my hair but once I use the blow dryer or hair straightener that coating disappears and I&#x27;m let with smooth,  silky straight hair. Love it and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> this was the big bottle! great price</li>
    <li> I was big fan of Smooth Down products and this basically Smooth Down Heat Glide in a new bottle. It is very think and you may be inclined to think you need more than the directions say. You don&#x27;t. You really only need one pump....rub your hands together and then on your hair. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> fast and as described</li>
    <li> This product contains ALMOND oil.  The previous Smooth Down Heat Glide contained MACADAMIA NUT OIL!!  BIG, HUGE, GREASY,FLAT  DIFFERENCE in hair.  Give us back the Macadamia nut oil!!!  I&#x27;m looking for a new product that is not Redken!</li>
    <li> It does not seem to protect my hair from breakage due as I&#x27;d hoped.  I use a flat iron regularly and was looking for a product to help keep my hair as healthy as it could be.  This product did add shine and has a plesant aroma.</li>
    <li> my favorite hair product.</li>
    <li> This really makes a difference.</li>
    <li> Ive tried everything to smooth my hair and not make it greasy, and this product totally does the trick!!! I have thick wavy hair that is very fine....usually very difficult for me to tame, but this helps 100%</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a good product is you know how to use it. My stylist applies this product to my hair in her salon and I love the final result. At home...not quite the same results which proves it&#x27;s me...</li>
    <li> I recommend using a half a pump first to see how much you really need for your hair. A little definitely goes a long way. Use on bottom half of hair and then apply to the rest. You don&#x27;t want to end up with greasy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this myself and I bought my mom a bottle to try. After she used her bottle up she wanted another.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay - smooth down heat glide discontinued product was better.</li>
    <li> wayyyyyy Too thick...but protects hair very well from heat...but what&#x27;s the point of using when makes you look so greasyyyyyy. So disappointed and so expensive. I can&#x27;t even give to someone else because it just looks so horrible. I made my sister and mom try they hate it also and we have three different hair textures.</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting. Was expecting the old version where it wasn&#x27;t as thick. The smell of the product isn&#x27;t that great anymore either. Sad to see the redken changed their awesome product to something that I can barely stand to use or smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/13/2016 edit: For those of you who are looking for a similar product to the old version of this product, I&#x27;ve found Matrix biolage deep smoothing serum works really well!</li>
