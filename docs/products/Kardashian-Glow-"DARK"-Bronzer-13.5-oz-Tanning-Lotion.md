<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love, Love, Love!!!! This lotion is amazing.... I use this daily!!!! I have been tanning for over 20 years and I have used a lot of different lotions. This is an awesome silicone lotion. It is soft ,silky and great for your skin. This lotion gives you a beautiful bronzed tan .</li>
    <li> My god...... My wife is happy!</li>
    <li> Works great. Same one at the tanning salon was retail priced at $130.</li>
    <li> Lotion is great I love it! I am hard to tan so this is great for me and it arrived at super fast time.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion and I&#x27;ve tried so many of them, the smell is great and the color results are amazing.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!!!  Gets a very beautiful tan glow to the skin along with very smooth skin!!</li>
    <li> works great for my skin, helped me get dark after one use! and the smell does not smell bad! smells really good</li>
    <li> I was not happy with this at all. It was like they mixed something else in the bottle and when you use it there are clumps of something within the product. I was totally not satisfied at all.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if I will ever purchase anything from here again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Kristi Mitchell</li>
    <li> Daughter loves it! Tanning salons rob people charging triple mark-ups!</li>
    <li> Get great color in tanning beds with this product.  It&#x27;s a must have. Great price also.</li>
    <li> I dont get to tan as often as I used to but using this lotion you cant even tell! I absolutely love it and smells amazing. You cant beat the price when it retails for over $100!</li>
    <li> Awesome! I got very tan bc of the bronzer!</li>
    <li> Great price! Way cheaper than any salon! I love it and so does the wif!</li>
    <li> This lotion works great, looks very much like a Florida tan, does not stain your hands, smells great and a smooth lotion.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on September 3rd.  I was leary as most because I cannot stand the Kardashian&#x27;s, any of them... LOL.  But I did some research and this was the best rated Bronzer out there.  I bought it and have been tanning in a Level 4 Bed 10mins 3x&#x27;s/wk, Bronzing Bed 12mins 1x/wk, and Stand Up Booth 12min 1x/wk. I got So DARK, so FAST!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- I have been seeing a few bad reviews on here; saying that it doesn&#x27;t work, not to waste your money on it. --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** The only reason I can see anyone NOT getting desired results, is if you are not in an appropriate bed or tanning frequently.  If you are tanning in a Level 1 or 2, it&#x27;s going to take a while for that lotion to give you your desired color, because the bulbs in those beds are not strong by any means, so it will take time before you even get a base tan. You need to be tanning in atleast a Level 3, preferrably a Level 4+.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I have been tanning for 3 weeks and it looks like I have been tanning for months on end.  I use this and rotate between that and the Tiara Tan Intensifier/Accelerator (because it&#x27;s not good to use a Bronzer every time you tan; bad for skin), I use the Crystal Faces for my Face because you&#x27;re not supposed to put any kind of Tanning Lotion or Bronzer on your face, and I use the Expose&#x60; Tan Extender Lotion after tanning, to lock in the the color.  My face was the first thing to get REALLY Dark because of the Crystal. The rest of my body has caught up with my face and it&#x27;s because I am using this Kardashian Dark Bronzer and an Accelerator.  But yeah, if you&#x27;re not using atleast a Level 3 or Level 4 bed, you won&#x27;t be getting Dark fast.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:: The Level Bed and Time in that Bed DOES count for this lotion to take Action.::&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:: Keep that in mind for this purchase. ::</li>
    <li> Absolutely love!! I&#x27;ve only used it twice and it has already given me good color with indoor tanning. Smells good and leaves my skin feeling very soft. The price is reasonable and no streaking! The shipping was also very fast.</li>
    <li> I love bronzer it works great and I&#x27;d highly recommend this product to anyone who likes to tan and what you do at tanning salons. I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for use as self tanner and not for tanning bed. This product did nothing as a self tanner and no color ever appeared. Was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Loved it! Got me super dark in a short amount of time. Definetly buying it again!</li>
    <li> I am very excited to use this lotion!! I sampled it and smelled it at the actual tanning salon, and it was amazing!! At the actual salon, it was waaaay out of my price range, but on Amazon, the price was just right. Same quality, but waaaay cheaper. I am thrilled to have found this lotion here and am excited to use it! Will order from shipper again.! Very happy</li>
    <li> This product is definitely not worth the money. Your paying for the name only !!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money by buying this product.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion because it does not contain silicone like a lot of the other lotions out there. Silicone makes me break out. This lotion gets me super dark and It&#x27;s like I could be a different race.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and did not leave a greasy residue after drying. recommend this product! My friends loved it as well and still use it today.</li>
    <li> The Dark Bronzer is okay, scent is a little overpowering, but I prefer the &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; bronzer instead.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. I was debating between it and a JWOWW. But this one ended up on sale at my tanning salon so I ended up getting it for a better price. I am so happy with my purchase. I am someone who tans pretty easily without lotions but I wanted something to help boost the process. I was going in level 4 beds and downgraded to level 2s when I bought this and by that night I could see the results happening. I go tanning 2-3 times a week and it just gets better and better. It doesn&#x27;t seem to work great on my face but I got Clearly Obsessed for my face which also is working great and seen results immediately. If you do by the lotion on here I do suggest you do serious background and fine print reading of if it is real or not. I know really good Australian golds do not sell online they sell strictly to tanning salons. That is not saying you can&#x27;t buy it online because I&#x27;m sure some salon or just sales person bought a bunch to sell on here but I would be weary of it. Just a tip I&#x27;m not sure what kardashians sales policies are but with some of the mixed reviews and how some are saying it is watery I wouldn&#x27;t trust buying it online.</li>
    <li> Again...I expected so much more from this product and the Kardashian&#x27;s...not impressed at all...no change in color either. Would not recommend this product or any relating products.</li>
    <li> The only thing I loved about the lotion was the smell. It doesn&#x27;t feel like it did anything as far as a tan. Won&#x27;t be buying it again. So glad I didn&#x27;t spend a fortune on it.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this tanning lotion.  I got a much darker tan than with normal tanning lotion.  Would definitely recommend this lotion to everyone!</li>
    <li> Great service great product</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this lotion, I love it!  I get great color and it smells great. It&#x27;s so nice to find this online at a small portion of what the tanning salons charge in store.</li>
    <li> After one use, I noticed a difference! A good golden bronze color, though it was a little slow to develop. The scent is very pleasant, even after tanning.. It&#x27;s a somewhat citrusy-fruity smell. Overall, I like it and would order it again. I&#x27;d like to try the other Kardashian tanning lotions.</li>
    <li> Overpriced and ineffective.  This stuff does not claim to do what it says.  Did not deepen my tan at all.  Save your money and buy something better, JWOWW&#x27;s stuff is pretty good.  Then again, what would you expect with the Kardashian name on it.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff for inside or out..I have a pool and I got darker than exspected laying out 2hrs a day this stuff is great!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love everything about this tanning lotion. No streaking, great smell, no after odor, leaves skin silky smooth, quick color, and best of all the price is wonderful!! Thank You Kardashian sisters. This product Rocks!</li>
    <li> This lotion isn&#x27;t bad, it is smooth when applied, however it is not as good as some others I have tried. This would be a great product for beginner tanners, but not so much for advanced. Just simply depends on your level, in order to get a nice dark tan, it will take a while on this product.</li>
    <li> I got the pkg very quickly, but when I took it out of the box it had no safety seal to show it was new. I think someone either opened it to smell it or try it. In this day and age I would NOT use anything that is not sealed. I called amazon and they credited my act immediately and the seller actually called me. Maybe who ever packs the merchandise opened it I don&#x27;t know but I sent it back ASAP.</li>
    <li> Absolutely cannot stand the &amp;#34;kardashian&amp;#34; people and their ridiculous tv shows, but love the tanning lotion! I will definitely buy lotions online from now on... This lotion is $130 at my salon!! :-/ that&#x27;s just nuts!! All because of the name...</li>
    <li> Loved the way it tans you I noticed a change after using it one time and I love the citrus smell</li>
    <li> As for using it at the tanning bed......well, I don&#x27;t see any difference in my color.  It could be the bulbs are weak at the tanning salon, but the lotion doesn&#x27;t seem to enhance my color either.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion..have to really rub it in or it can be streaky..if you have a base tan it works very well!</li>
    <li> I use this on my face and it gives me that perfect summer glow no orange color. I use it outside when I tan so it does work outdoors and the smell is amazing I feel feellike a million bucks when I have this on.</li>
    <li> The only thing I would have felt better about was if it came with a sealed top, which it didn&#x27;t. The product did not seem to be tampered with though and I am very pleased with the tanning lotion</li>
    <li> Great product and price!</li>
    <li> This is not the real thing. Do not waste your money! Leaves a terrible residue on your skin. I have used the real thing and this isn&#x27;t even close. Want my money back. The bottle isn&#x27;t even the color it is suppose to be. Never been disappointed on amazon. After my last order I hesitate to buy anything.</li>
    <li> This came in within two days and it a great product! I love it, and it&#x27;s much cheaper then buying it at a tanning place.</li>
    <li> I bought this tanning lotion because I had heard really good things about it from friends. It works so well, smells good, and you can&#x27;t beat the price... I will definitely be buying again</li>
    <li> I have used many lotions and I absolutley love this one. I have gotten several compliments of the darkness of my skin since using this. I will be getting more.</li>
    <li> I love this product no orange on my hands or around my feet like other bronzers. The lotion smells fantastic and it usually takes me at least 30 days to start seeing any kind of a tan and I began seeing a tan within a week. I&#x27;m fair skinned so I start out only going into the tanning bed for 5 minutes then 7 minutes and I work my way up. I&#x27;m already up to the full time in the tanning bed and I do not get burnt like I used to if I tried to rush my tan. I&#x27;m definently going to be purchasing this again. Also the cost where I go this would be $120 so this is a bargain price.</li>
    <li> My bestie and I tried this she is naturally darker and I am fair both of us agree this lotion doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s poor quality for a $100 in stores! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This seems like a good product , it is compare up there as very good but alittle pricey for a comparble tan</li>
    <li> One problem, after seeing my clothes not sure if I would buy again. Didn&#x27;t see a difference,skin was not glowing almost like I had nothing on. Im fair skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 80% satisfied with this lotion. I had kind of platoed with the lotion I was using at the time, and wasn&#x27;t getting any darker so I started researching and landed on this one. As far as the Kardashian&#x27;s go, I&#x27;m just as sick of them as everyone else is.. But when it comes to their PRODUCTS (and not their personalities) they always seem to be very high quality. This lotion goes on great, not sticky or greasy at all! It smells lovely and tropical going on, but after you tan... mmm, not so much! I know most lotions don&#x27;t smell fabulous afterward, but this one especially, is just really harsh! Think burnt B.O. and musky perfume mixed. I do love the nice dark color it gives me, not at all orangey! This lotion gives great results! But if you&#x27;ve made plans, or have somewhere important to be after you leave the tanning salon.. you are really gonna need a shower first!</li>
    <li> Not a bad tanning lotion! Matte finish and absorbs fast without a greasy finish. Beat buying it for full price in the salon (for 140 bucks!!!)</li>
    <li> Works great and smells great.</li>
    <li> Amazing Price !!!! Super Fast Delivery !!!! the item is definetly the real thing i used to buy the packages which costed me around $20 every time so i decided to go ahead and make the purchase im very satisfied thank you soo much !!! will recommend to all friends</li>
    <li> Of the three Kardashian lotions that I&#x27;ve tried, this is my favorite. It gives me nice color and as with their other lotions, it smells nice and doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
    <li> I have used this before and LOVED but I am curious does it have hemp in it? Does anyone know? I need lotion with hemp bc hemp is the only kind I can use that don&#x27;t make me itch like crazy</li>
    <li> I hate the Kardashians, so I was really hesitant to try this lotion just because I don&#x27;t like them, but I&#x27;m glad I did. This has become one of my favorite lotions ever. While I often get a more golden/Mystic Tan-looking color from lotions like Splurge and Elusive, I got a darker, more brownish color from this lotion. It really helped develop that deep tan in high level beds. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for deep color without looking like a tanorexic.</li>
    <li> This product is faux (fake) it&#x27;s not the official kardashian glow tanning lotion. I want a refund. So unhappy &amp; disappointed!</li>
    <li> I am a regular tanner and finally tried this product due to the fuss about it. I went into my regular stand up for the regular time and am completely burnt. I don&#x27;t think this product is for everyone.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion was retailed at over $125 and it definitely was not worth the money. My tanning bed sells this product for $99 and I got a &amp;#34;good deal&amp;#34; for around $45. It was not even worth the $45 I spent.&lt;br /&gt;Kardashian girls-go back to the drawing board or be careful what you put your name on!</li>
    <li> Alright so here&#x27;s the deal with buying a tanning lotion online for all of you that think the mark up at tanning salons is extremely high. First this product sold straight from the manufacturer cost MORE for the tanning salon than what it is being sold for online. Which only tells you there is something defective about the lotion being sold online- it may be a different lotion in the bottle, water down or even half the bottle was used and then filled with a different lotion. I have been to multiple tanning conferences and the selling of online products defaces the value and lowers the quality of the lotion greatly(probably because it isn&#x27;t the true lotion). Support your local tanning salons and buy lotions which you actually know which ingredients you are putting on your skin!!</li>
    <li> I only purchased this because of the steep Amazon discount... I dont particularly care for the Kardashian line of products anyways.  This tanning lotion is very dark and not streaky, and enhances your skins tanning ability.  You will tan much more easily with this lotion, so don&#x27;t choose an upper limit time for your first couple lays with this lotion.  It smells incredible and when I tan midday, there&#x27;s no ato, just fruity smelling soft skin.  Although I don&#x27;t like sticking to a single lotion too long, I would definitely make this purchase again.</li>
    <li> I expected lotion to have a deeper &amp;#34;DARK&amp;#34; bronzer and does not. Has a scent of an orange. I presume that over time it will do the trick, but I would never by this product again. I did however purchase the Glow Ice Bronzer before I purchased this one and it was great for smell and production.</li>
    <li> Love this tanning lotion my tanning salon sells it for $75 what a rip off ot came very quickly smelled and worked the same I  bought from my salon previously. I was a little scared to buy one from someone else but it turns out its fine. Turns me dark really fast smells strong but im used to it by now</li>
    <li> I love this lotion - it is $140 at the salon!!  Def buy it here!  Works great - bronzing w/o streaking</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this lotion. Will be ordering another bottle in about a month. And it came before the arrival date!</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the rave reviews. I am a good regular tanner, with a nice tan. I went to use this lotion, and was SO disappointed!!! It did absolutely nothing for me. I have found the playboy lotions, and any of Jwoww&#x27;s lotions to be the best. I did however get the tan extender lotion, and it&#x27;s AMAZING, but for the tanning lotions I DO NOT recommend this :(</li>
    <li> This lotion smells great but I have used it about 4 times and I&#x27;m not any more tan than I would be using any other kind of lotion.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Most lotions have a funky smell but this product smells sweet and reminds me of the tropics. The package is nice too. I really like the neon colors. I saved a ton of money buying it online. Highly recommend for those who love a deep dark glow.</li>
    <li> Good Lotion - As Much As I Hated Giving The Kardashian&#x27;s My Money UGH</li>
    <li> AWESOME tanning lotion!</li>
    <li> GOOD TANING LOTION BUT NOT THE BEST</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Probably one the of the best smelling tanning products I&#x27;ve ever used. The color isn&#x27;t too dark of a brown or bronze color.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome tanning product. I have used many other tanning lotions but nothing has compared to this. I am instantly dark and don&#x27;t burn. This product is definitely worth the money. You don&#x27;t smell burnt afterwards either. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Horrible it was almost &amp;#34;chunky&amp;#34; I think it was old</li>
    <li> This was pricier than the other lotions but really did not find it to work all that well it did not enhance my tan nor did it give a better color</li>
    <li> Good purchase. Works really well and smells really good. Love those kardAshians. They&#x27;re such great business woman and tanning lotion creators</li>
    <li> I have used so many different tanning lotions over the years and this one is a keeper! Nice scent, goes on well and dries pretty quickly. Gives excellent color without the tingle!!</li>
    <li> You have to add lots of products for at least 5 days to take effect and skin to gain color.</li>
    <li> I recieved the lotion earlier than expected,which was great! I also really enjoy the lotion and the price was GREAT! Thanx</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great my favorite tanning lotion</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  It&#x27;s one of the best lotions out there right now.  It got here pretty fast too. And so much cheaper then the tanning places sell it for. Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I have tried all of the top of the line tanning lotions and I&#x27;ve never gotten as dark so fast! It&#x27;s very moisturizing and not a bad smell either. Saved so much $$ getting it from Amazon vs. tanning salon! Again, I am so dark from this! Gorgeous tan! Will definitely buy again!!</li>
    <li> This is the best bronzer I have ever used!  It is so creamy and your skin looks beautiful after application. I love looking tan, but hate sun damage. This product looks totally natural and I hope they make it forever!</li>
    <li> Got me color in 2 tans! It doesn&#x27;t smell bad either, and keeps your skin so soft!! I&#x27;d highly recommend to anyone especially trying to get some color fast!</li>
    <li> Great color, smells good and super soft skin. Love it. It makes my top three list. Best on the market for 2013 and wicked cheap compared to a tanning salon.</li>
    <li> I having been tanning for the last 10 years and have been found of spellbound tanning lotion; but I can honestly say that this is worth the money and actually just purchased their Kardashian GlowTM \\&quot;Intensifier\\&quot; tanning lotion. I see myself getting darker after every use and it does not make me burn, I paid retail for it at my tanning salon and would honestly purchase it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> It was the real bottle but too thin that gives me doubts its the real stuff. But it didn&#x27;t turn me green.</li>
    <li> The scent is amazing and the color I achieved with this product has been nothing short of amazing.  The only drawback I have is the size of the bottle, it is quite large. When I am going to tan I don&#x27;t want a lot of extra stuff to carry with me, so a smaller bottle would be nice.</li>
    <li> Against my better judgment I bought this produce for my 17 year old niece&#x27;s birthday. She&#x27;s a huge Kardashian fan and she thought this would be a good product; after using it for a while she said it was awful.  After seeing the commercial for the first time a couple days ago I feel like I need to review this product. The Kardashian girls should be ashamed of their selves for trying to sell a product by telling people that it makes you look thinner. Their selling points are BEYOND unethical, much like that ultra-high fee credit card featuring the Kardashian name that they tried pawning off on consumers. I will NEVER buy anything with their name on it, or promoted by them ever again. I would love to know what their evidence is that having a tan makes you look thinner. I wish I had seen the commercial before spending $50 on this; I would have never bought it solely based on what was said in the commercial. Needless to say my niece is no longer a fan, good for her!</li>
    <li> It gave you some color but not quickly.. It smelt great even after you get out of the bed.  Just isnt giving me the dark I desire</li>
    <li> This lotion left a sugar feel to my body afterwards.  I could wipe my arm and it would have a Sugar text. This lotion also did not get me super dark like I thought it would. I hv had lotion the same price at the salon and cheaper that hot me darker a lot faster.</li>
    <li> Worst lotion I have ever used.  It balls up on your skin when dry.  It smells nice but that&#x27;s about it.  I highly recommend not buying this lotion.  However I got the tan extender and it works well.</li>
    <li> Perfect product for tanning beds, give great color while protecting your skin.  Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out.  Great smell and prompt service.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this lotion! Gives you a beautiful brown color, doesn&#x27;t turn you orange at all! Designer skin products are the best and the Kardashian line is awesome! Definitely a favorite.</li>
    <li> I tried this lotion at a tanning salon for $15.00. a PACKET!! It really worked though, I got great color for an event. I finally decided to ask how much for the bottle. It is selling for $130.00 for a bottle. So outrageous almost a 200% mark up. Thank you for getting it to me quickly and making it affordable!</li>
    <li> I did not like this too much</li>
    <li> Too dark for winter use.</li>
    <li> This in not the real thing, it leaves a terrible residue all over your skin. I&#x27;m very disappointed and want my money back</li>
    <li> Love the product and i recieved it so fast! I love the silky finish on my skin and it tans so well!</li>
    <li> Great smell and provides nice color. I use it outside in my yard</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve have never been this tan using tanning lotion. Great product and it arrived earlier than expected! Good choice gals</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!! I have used other tanning lotions such as JWOWW and they were great, but I haven&#x27;t gotten results like I have from Kardashian Glow! I am so dark and I have been using it for about 2 weeks! I definitely recommend this product! The added bonus it&#x27;s smells amazing too!</li>
    <li> The smell is great. Sort of a apricot smell. So far seems to be doing great as far as the color it gives.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  I was disappointed when my Salon stopped selling this but was happy when I received it from Amazon and it was exactly the same and cost a lot less.  Great product for use indoor and out.</li>
    <li> Is not one of the best products through Amazon. It did not get me as dark as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Best shipping ever.Get some and enjoy!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and is the real product, which is awesome! thank you!</li>
    <li> I like the lotion. I compared it to some at the tanning salon and it smells the same but is a little lighter in color than the one they had. The girl at the salon said it might be old. It works well though.</li>
    <li> Be careful with this product! Make sure you try it first on a small patch on your skin to see if you get an allergic reaction to its ingredients. I broke out in rashes all over my thighs, butt, and legs right after just using it once today! Again, be careful.</li>
    <li> Wow. Let me start by saing I ordered my product Sunday and revived it Wednesday. Best shipping ever. A lot of people are afraid that it&#x27;s a fake product, but it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells great and leaves my skin with a healthy glow and very soft! One of the best indoor tanning lotions out there</li>
    <li> After tanning three times I can already tell a huge difference! I would not buy this at a tanning salon because the havc it marked up to $140.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with the item used it twice and never seen a difference. By using it while tanning. So I found another tanning lotion that is GREAT! I seen results by the next day.</li>
    <li> I love it ,it thebest lotion of you so far</li>
    <li> The smell is Amazing!!! It also feels good too. I did feel darker after using it but seriously Id use it just for the smell lol n its way cheaper on here then in the salon!!  Great buy!!</li>
    <li> It smelled good but wasn&#x27;t happy with the results. A total waste of money. Seems like the Kardashians will stick their name on anything to make a buck. The Pauly D or Jwoww lotions are much better.</li>
    <li> one thing that was really nice about this product was that it dried really quickly and didn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy after using it.  however, I have definitely used better products that have gotten me much darker.  I&#x27;ve used the Snooki dark bronzer and Luminary and saw better results with those.</li>
    <li> my girlfriend loves it so I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s a good product!</li>
    <li> Very good product. Tanned faster.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! I got sooooo dark. Smells terrible the \\&quot;natural bronzer\\&quot; smells great so I thought this one would but it doesn&#x27;t. Very moisturizing. I will buy every time I need a new lotion this stuffs amazing!</li>
    <li> A bit overpriced for what you receive, granted you are paying for the name. I prefer other top lines over this one but it is a decent product. Smells good and certainly delivers a decent tan.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure after purchasing this on amazon if I would be getting the real stuff. It works great and helps get a darker tan. I saved quite a bit by buying it on amazon and not in my salon.</li>
    <li> this lotion fake don&#x27;t waste your time</li>
    <li> Excited about the price of this product.  Never used before but really like the way it helps you tan.  Smells great too. Delivered as expected!! Thanks</li>
