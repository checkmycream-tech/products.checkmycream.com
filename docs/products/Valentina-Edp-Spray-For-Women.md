    <li> I love the smell.  My second time buying it.</li>
    <li> Love it my fav for the summer</li>
    <li> The flowers made the bottle look a little on the cheap side.</li>
    <li> Smells similar to a &#x27;granny&#x27; perfume. Not for me.</li>
    <li> this is the best cologne I have ever used</li>
    <li> excellent...just what I wanted!</li>
    <li> Elegant fragrance. Bought it for my mother as a gift and she loves it!</li>
    <li> This does not smell like the tester in the department store.  As my daughter-in-law shared, it smells like an old lady scent.</li>
    <li> to sexy for my bod-and love it be back soon.great presents</li>
    <li> This has become my &#x27;signature&#x27; scent.  I struggle to find it in department stores, however.  Thankfully I can order it here.  It arrived quickly and I feel like &#x27;me&#x27; again.  I can&#x27;t say how many times I am complimented that I smell good.  Not too strong, not overpowering, just enough!</li>
    <li> Love the smell, lasts all day.</li>
    <li> When I get it, it was broken!. Even I cannot return it !</li>
    <li> Great seller. Original perfume</li>
    <li> Buying it here on Amazon was the first time I&#x27;d bought it after I had one of those samples from a magazine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells very similar to the sample and smells absolutely wonderful on me. All perfumes change scent from the bottle and the moment it&#x27;s on your skin, so I recommend trying it before buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this perfume (it&#x27;s hard for me to find ones that don&#x27;t turn) and I&#x27;ve bought another bottle since!</li>
    <li> This perfume smells amazing.  It&#x27;s a very sensual, feminine floral scent with a darker deeper base.  Unfortunately, the scent disappears completely within a couple of hours.  Buy the big bottle if you plan to use this--you&#x27;ll have to keep reapplying.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!!! Clean, fresh scent, not too heavy scent.</li>
    <li> Just like advertised, fresh and as described, I had previously run into some that was old and not right from a discount place. Got this from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my fiance. Smells very nice. Bottle is a unique design. Fragrance stays on the skin the whole day. Good Purchase.</li>
    <li> great service and great price</li>
    <li> For ladies that love a soft sweet smell this is the one right here so far my favorite  fragrance</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t exactly match the real thing you buy in a big store but it smells great and I have purchased this perfume more than once already.</li>
    <li> I really love the smell of this however it does not last long. So carry some extra with you when you go out!</li>
