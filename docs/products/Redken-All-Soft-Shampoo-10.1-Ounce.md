### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>After being a Therappe user for over 20 years &amp; having to find another product after they changed the formula, this is excellent!  </li>
      <li>Love this!  </li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>So glad my hair dresser recommended it!</li>
      <li>This shampoo works best when followed with the Redken All Soft Conditioner.</li>
      <li>This is awesome &amp; also has a light scent that is great for people like me who are sensitive to strong smells.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine hair, and it even works well for me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now my hair is substantially smoother with a lot more sheen.  </li>
      <li>I use it most of the time, and my husband likes it too.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love the price</li>
      <li>Love.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, once I decided to chop off my waist length hair and go for a more modern/cooler look, I no longer had an option of ignoring it&#x27;s care with a &#x27;farm girl&#x27; solution.</li>
      <li>This is the BEST Redken product line for extremely DRY hair.</li>
      <li>As an experiment, I&#x27;ve occasionally tried my son&#x27;s or husband&#x27;s shampoos, to make sure I&#x27;m not making up how incredible the Redken shampoo is.</li>
      <li>Best product hands down!</li>
      <li>, the shampoo from Atlas Pros Choice was genuine Redken</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit more costly but well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Redkin soft is a good quality product</li>
      <li>So, I truly know that it IS the Redken shampoo that is making my hair look fabulous and for that, the price is SO worth it!</li>
      <li>Each time I used it my hair got more and more normal looking.  </li>
      <li>Super fast shipment, would buy again for sure no doubt.</li>
      <li>For us, the perfume is mild enough so we don&#x27;t mind it, and it is also good for a child&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>This shampoo does exactly as it says!  </li>
      <li>Worth every penny &amp; the shampoo</li>
      <li>Fast Delivery!</li>
      <li>so this might be a consideration for those who are interested in buying products from a conscientious company.</li>
      <li>You can probably get a better deal at a salon or beauty store, especially if they sell the Shampoo and Conditioner Duos.</li>
      <li>and although I do like the old formula better, this new formula is not that bad).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used Lush, Joico, Matrix, Loreal, Keratase, and many many other shampoos.</li>
      <li>I need no other conditioners or additions to keep my hair smooth, in place, shiny, and well-behaved.</li>
      <li>the less it is still better than many of the other off the shelf store-bought varieties available as it doesn&#x27;t strip the life out of your hair.  </li>
      <li>Makes hair super soft and silky and manageable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few shampoos for my dry brittle hair but the Redken All Soft shampoo seems to work the best.</li>
      <li>Soft is a softening shampoo that provides 15 times more conditioning than using conditioning oils such as argan-oil which is why All Soft is so effective at preventing and treating brittle and dry hair.</li>
      <li>I tried every product on the market, from Dollar Store to high end salons and NOTHING could make my hair look pretty, so I always just kept it braided or in the dreaded B.U.N.!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This shampoo really helped to soften my hair.  </li>
      <li>When I use Redken All Soft Shampoo, my hair feels smooth and soft to the touch.</li>
      <li>Lucky me, that the salon that I trusted to help me make the transition from super long to super short sold this product</li>
      <li>Perhaps they changed the formula or cut back on active ingredients, but it&#x27;s not as good as it used to be,  </li>
      <li>love redken though and use their other products.</li>
      <li>would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>fantastic for repairing damaged or very dry hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for a few years and it used to be better.  </li>
      <li>It does live up to it&#x27;s name.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair feeling very soft.</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair silky soft!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s been the answer to my hair problems since I first was introduced to it, back in 2001.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>Leaves your hair so soft!  </li>
      <li>This shampoo really does make my coarse, wavy hair soft.</li>
      <li>So I decided to try something else and found Redkin All Soft Shampoo.</li>
      <li>I have been using the All Soft product line for about 7 years now</li>
      <li>Chemotherapy made me lose my hair and the hair growing back was very wiry and curly.  </li>
      <li>and it makes your hair soft</li>
      <li>All Soft.</li>
      <li>It leaves my thick hair clean and soft.</li>
      <li>They use cleansing shampoo to get the chlorine out but this shampoo restores soft back in their hair 100 percent!!!!</li>
      <li>this combined with the all soft conditioner, left a build up on my hair that I had to have my hairdresser remove.  </li>
      <li>Nice smell; otherwise not impressed.</li>
      <li>It certainly is a shampoo, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a whole lot of change in my wildly thick, wavy hair.</li>
      <li>My hair was feeling very dry and it helped alot with making it soft againl.</li>

<li> Though this shampoo left my hair fairly soft, I have had better results with Loreal and Loreal is less expensive.</li>
<li> I was in a panic because I have coarse dry hair &amp; need a hydrating shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling like there&#x27;s a film on it.  </li>
<li> Its keratine complex replenishes hair while adding intense softness.</li>
<li> so I only wash my hair every other day.</li>
<li> It softens my dry, frizzy, color treated hair...</li>
<li> I had been using Nexxus Therappe shampoo for quite some time and noticed that my hair looked dry and fly-away.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve always had dry, tangly hair</li>
<li> the only reason i&#x27;m giving 3 * is because it is personally too heavy for my hair.</li>
<li> but I only need to use a little bit to get by, whereas with other shampoos I would use a lot.</li>
<li> I tried several products to tame it, with minimal results.  </li>
<li> Check my other review on ArganEsque hair oil..</li>
<li> Add to that mix, I have a highly processed colour choice and my hair is an ethnic mix of two wildy different races and you end up with a \\&quot;hot mess\\&quot; of crunchy, disheveled, miserable hair.</li>
<li> Even before my hair is dried, I can tell the difference</li>
<li> My girls swim year round in a chlorine pool so their hair is hard and brittle after.</li>
<li> and once it is dried, I&#x27;m looking at a Witch&#x27;s Broom of hair in the mirrow!</li>
<li> I work outside for a living, so my poor hair is always sun-baked and blasted by 80-100 degree days in the Summer and freezing temps in the Winter.</li>
<li> Then, by accident, I read reviews that said Nexxus had changed their ingredients, and further, received horrible reviews.  </li>
<li> This product is a fake.</li>
<li> :(</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Its the only stuff I can use, my hair doesnt tangle with it at all and it makes your hair soft</li>
    <li> This shampoo does exactly as it says!  It softens my dry, frizzy, color treated hair...Check my other review on ArganEsque hair oil..together as part of my hair regimen...it works!!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo really does make my coarse, wavy hair soft.</li>
    <li> No Problems! Fast Delivery! A++++</li>
    <li> Nice smell; otherwise not impressed.</li>
    <li> Though this shampoo left my hair fairly soft, I have had better results with Loreal and Loreal is less expensive.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair feeling very soft.</li>
    <li> So-so on this product. It certainly is a shampoo, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a whole lot of change in my wildly thick, wavy hair.</li>
    <li> When I use Redken All Soft Shampoo, my hair feels smooth and soft to the touch. I use it most of the time, and my husband likes it too.</li>
    <li> Chemotherapy made me lose my hair and the hair growing back was very wiry and curly.  I tried several products to tame it, with minimal results.  Then a friend told me to try this and it has made all the difference in the world.  Each time I used it my hair got more and more normal looking.  For a while there I was looking like Albert Einstein with his finger in an electrical socket.  Now my hair is substantially smoother with a lot more sheen.  I don&#x27;t even need to use conditioner or styling gel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for a few years and it used to be better.  Perhaps they changed the formula or cut back on active ingredients, but it&#x27;s not as good as it used to be,  None the less it is still better than many of the other off the shelf store-bought varieties available as it doesn&#x27;t strip the life out of your hair.  Redken does not advertise this on their bottles but from what I&#x27;ve been told by hair care professionals their products are cruelty-free (they&#x27;re not lab tested on animals) so this might be a consideration for those who are interested in buying products from a conscientious company.</li>
    <li> Redkin soft is a good quality product and I have used it several times.  It leaves my thick hair clean and soft.</li>
    <li> This product is a fake. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had dry, tangly hair and I&#x27;ve changed my hair regimen so I only wash my hair every other day. I have used Lush, Joico, Matrix, Loreal, Keratase, and many many other shampoos. This is the only shampoo that makes a difference with the tangles. I don&#x27;t have to use my detangler brush anymore with this! I don&#x27;t love the price but I only need to use a little bit to get by, whereas with other shampoos I would use a lot. Love.</li>
    <li> This is our go-to shampoo. For us, the perfume is mild enough so we don&#x27;t mind it, and it is also good for a child&#x27;s hair. It does not seem to cause eye irritation. I have very fine hair, and it even works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the shampoo from Atlas Pros Choice was genuine Redken All Soft. I will order again from them.</li>
    <li> This shampoo really helped to soften my hair.  My hair was feeling very dry and it helped alot with making it soft againl.</li>
    <li> Love this!  Leaves your hair so soft!  I dye my hair blonde and have blond highlights and this is the only thing that keeps it from feeling fried!  It keeps my hair silky soft!</li>
    <li> Best product hands down! My girls swim year round in a chlorine pool so their hair is hard and brittle after. They use cleansing shampoo to get the chlorine out but this shampoo restores soft back in their hair 100 percent!!!! I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it! So glad my hair dresser recommended it!</li>
    <li> this combined with the all soft conditioner, left a build up on my hair that I had to have my hairdresser remove.  It felt like I had a helmet on!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few shampoos for my dry brittle hair but the Redken All Soft shampoo seems to work the best. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I work outside for a living, so my poor hair is always sun-baked and blasted by 80-100 degree days in the Summer and freezing temps in the Winter. Add to that mix, I have a highly processed colour choice and my hair is an ethnic mix of two wildy different races and you end up with a \\&quot;hot mess\\&quot; of crunchy, disheveled, miserable hair. :( I tried every product on the market, from Dollar Store to high end salons and NOTHING could make my hair look pretty, so I always just kept it braided or in the dreaded B.U.N.!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, once I decided to chop off my waist length hair and go for a more modern/cooler look, I no longer had an option of ignoring it&#x27;s care with a &#x27;farm girl&#x27; solution. Lucky me, that the salon that I trusted to help me make the transition from super long to super short sold this product and it&#x27;s been the answer to my hair problems since I first was introduced to it, back in 2001.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, eleven years later and countless bottles later, it is the ONLY shampoo that I&#x27;ll allow to touch my hair! I need no other conditioners or additions to keep my hair smooth, in place, shiny, and well-behaved. As an experiment, I&#x27;ve occasionally tried my son&#x27;s or husband&#x27;s shampoos, to make sure I&#x27;m not making up how incredible the Redken shampoo is. What.A.Mistake.!!! Even before my hair is dried, I can tell the difference and once it is dried, I&#x27;m looking at a Witch&#x27;s Broom of hair in the mirrow! So, I truly know that it IS the Redken shampoo that is making my hair look fabulous and for that, the price is SO worth it!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST Redken product line for extremely DRY hair. I have been using the All Soft product line for about 7 years now (this is the newer formula and although I do like the old formula better, this new formula is not that bad).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Soft is a softening shampoo that provides 15 times more conditioning than using conditioning oils such as argan-oil which is why All Soft is so effective at preventing and treating brittle and dry hair. Its keratine complex replenishes hair while adding intense softness. This shampoo works best when followed with the Redken All Soft Conditioner. You can probably get a better deal at a salon or beauty store, especially if they sell the Shampoo and Conditioner Duos.</li>
    <li> the only reason i&#x27;m giving 3 * is because it is personally too heavy for my hair. love redken though and use their other products.</li>
    <li> After being a Therappe user for over 20 years &amp; having to find another product after they changed the formula, this is excellent!  I was in a panic because I have coarse dry hair &amp; need a hydrating shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling like there&#x27;s a film on it.  This is awesome &amp; also has a light scent that is great for people like me who are sensitive to strong smells.  Worth every penny &amp; the shampoo I will be using for the next 20 years, that is, if they don&#x27;t change the formula.</li>
    <li> Love this! Makes hair super soft and silky and manageable. Super fast shipment, would buy again for sure no doubt.</li>
    <li> I had been using Nexxus Therappe shampoo for quite some time and noticed that my hair looked dry and fly-away.  Then, by accident, I read reviews that said Nexxus had changed their ingredients, and further, received horrible reviews.  So I decided to try something else and found Redkin All Soft Shampoo. It does live up to it&#x27;s name. It&#x27;s a bit more costly but well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> fantastic for repairing damaged or very dry hair</li>
