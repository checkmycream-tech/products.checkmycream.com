<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> You get a lot for the price you pay. The tools and case don&#x27;t look or feel high quality, but that&#x27;s to be expected.  Tweezers were useless when first received. Heads were half a millimeter apart and practically clamped together. I held the tweezer heads apart for 10 minutes and now they&#x27;re separated enough to be usable.</li>
    <li> This is a nice little set. Heavy duty, and all the tools seem to work well for their intended purposes. The case and instruments both seem high quality. The only thing I had an issue with was the fingernail clippers; they just don&#x27;t seem to have quite enough leverage to make a clean cut without applying a lot of pressure.</li>
    <li> Perfect for on the go</li>
    <li> Good cheap manicure set. I don&#x27;t even know what some of the tools are for...lol. Great for a travel set.</li>
    <li> Everything  worked but the large clipper. Did not work  for men or women&#x27;s toe nails.</li>
    <li> Good one. Price is also good and worth of it. It comes with nice box and packaging.</li>
    <li> I returned this because the first time I tried to use a clipper, it fell apart in my hand. Metal seems to be of inferior quality.</li>
    <li> A great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is: sometimes it is a little difficult to close the case without a little adjustment of all the tools.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this set; fast delivery and BETTER than expected!</li>
    <li> Amazing set, very sturdy use all the time</li>
    <li> High quality  materials, great kit</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Great gift idea. Everyone needs a set.</li>
    <li> Not the best, but does the job ok.</li>
    <li> Nice case have Noter used it much but appears good for price</li>
    <li> Great assortment of grooming tools, but cheaply made.  Clippers sometimes require a second pass; hard to get a clean cut on a nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a full set, but it smells terrible. Wreaks of chemicals or something that I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on. Are these even safe to use?</li>
    <li> Most of the tools hold up nicely, the clippers are sterdy enough for my use, tweezers a &#x27;little&#x27; flimsy but they are accurate. Overall very glad for this purchase.</li>
    <li> have had less than a week and used only 2 times, and the tools are already breaking.  Not quality item.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I got these for all my boys for Christmas. Even though it took forever for the sets to arrive everyone loved them, Even my husband. He said well made. very sharp.</li>
    <li> Very cheap product.... You ALWAYS get what you pay for. Not even worth sending back! :(</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for I guess. The metal used to make the tweezers is so weak that they collapse when you squeeze them. Enough said.</li>
    <li> Really useful things in life.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty nice set! Stainless steel so will never worry about rust. Would have given 5 stars, but would&#x27;ve loved it if it had a nail file in it...Well worth the price tho.</li>
    <li> Very pleased arrived quickly</li>
    <li> good selection and nice case</li>
    <li> Great little travel set.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t even cut through my nail.</li>
    <li> Seems high quality especially considering the price. Lots of crazy looking tools i&#x27;m a little afraid of but the things I do use are well made and sharp.</li>
    <li> Junk!  I bet this cost the seller .99 to produce.  The clasp didn&#x27;t work upon opening it.  DO NOT BUY.  Amazon is beginning to really upset me with how much junk they are selling now.  It looks nice in the photo but you may as well just toss your money out the window.</li>
    <li> great set for the money</li>
    <li> Good tools but the case cover quickly seperated from the form.</li>
    <li> What you see is what you get it&#x27;s great! The case is very nice too</li>
    <li> these are ok for the price.</li>
    <li> Not well made. Rather they easily ruin the pampering experience they are meant to be/ enhance.</li>
    <li> Better than the price dictates.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny. Everything works great.</li>
    <li> I received the kit this very afternoon. The pouch thing was bent and doesn&#x27;t close unless you force it, and it likes to pop open. The clippers are strong, but have very unpolished rough edges, and even the big clipper doesn&#x27;t open very wide. The finer tools appear to be made out of aluminum foil. The tweezers lasted 90 seconds out of the pack before bending. One of the cuticle tools bent on my fingernail. I&#x27;m not the Incredible Hulk breaking stuff left and right; I only ever need to replace clipper kits because I lose the tools over the years. This kit is complete rubbish and a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Great little travel pack with everything in one case and protected.</li>
    <li> The variety of tools is great.  The case is plush and well made.  It fits in my purse.  It&#x27;s a bit bigger than anticipated, so if you carry a tiny purse, this&#x27;ll take up half of it.  The tools are sharp too.  BUT, is it just me, or do these tools feel strange?  The metal has an unfinished feel to it....  it&#x27;s not shiny soft slick metal.  It&#x27;s weird. I really dislike that part of it.</li>
    <li> This personal hygiene product is great and made of strong material. I use it weekly and love the design and quality for the price I received.</li>
    <li> Great quality to the set! Shipped fast and delivered fast. A little smaller then it looks</li>
    <li> Nice little kit. Doesnt seem to have a cuticle pusher which I sorely need.  A little heavy for my purse though (its heavy enough!)</li>
    <li> Good but the bag does not close well</li>
    <li> The tools aren&#x27;t as sharp as I thought they&#x27;d be. It has occasionally not clipped the nail cleanly and ripped it.</li>
    <li> I sometimes have a hard time clipping my nails. With this it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Not so good..would not recommend</li>
    <li> I like this manicure set. The case looks nice and closes easily, and the tools are sturdy, well made and sharp.</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made... should have figured by the price.  I wanted it for the cuticle cutter, it broke right away.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product. Stainless Steel really helps.</li>
    <li> Very nice set for the money.  Great for travel</li>
    <li> Love this.  Great for traveling too!  Sturdy tools.  Case keep them all organized and together.</li>
    <li> great product and very reasonable priced. Would like tools a little stronger.</li>
    <li> All the tools we needed for nails and in a nice hard protective case.  The quality of each item we have used it very good.  No complaints at all.</li>
    <li> clips nails as it is supposed to</li>
    <li> This is pretty great i wasn&#x27;t expecting it to look really nice when i received it but its a definite must buy</li>
    <li> Tools are extremely dull.</li>
    <li> Terrible quality -- you get a lot of tools for the price, but they&#x27;re so dull they don&#x27;t work. The build quality is so bad.</li>
    <li> Pretty cool set. Strong clippers to.</li>
    <li> For the price and stainless steel-quality of this kit, it&#x27;s a great buy. You won&#x27;t often find this beautiful of a presentation of all these tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the one downfall to the set is how quickly the clippers in particular need to be sharpened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You aren&#x27;t buying this kit for the storage. It&#x27;s decently made but I can see how it&#x27;ll come apart after time.</li>
    <li> Love love love this kit! I&#x27;ve been using it every week since I bought it. Great price and great product!!!</li>
    <li> Great set. They are stainless steel and heavy duty. They will last a long time and better quality than some sold at stores.</li>
    <li> The best for the price. Super neat package. Everything you need for a manicure/pedicure in a cute little case.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Delivery was on time and the item is very professional same exact tools as the nail salon.</li>
    <li> It has a few things in it that I don&#x27;t know what they are and they freak me out a little... One thing looks like a razor blade on a stick...</li>
    <li> Was disappointed in the quality.</li>
    <li> I was pretty interested in this to add to my fathers gift and although it was pretty low priced, I did not get what I ordered. I ended up getting something femanine on the outside and I could no longer give it to my dad being that he&#x27;s an old school kind of guy so I know he wouldn&#x27;t use it, I know kind of frustrating. But the point is, people should be held responsible for stuff like this.</li>
    <li> I really like this kit! The quality is great, the cuticle clippers are still sharp months later and the little straps to hold each tool in place are still very tight.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my sibling as a gift.  It turned out to be exactly the kind of thing that they were looking for.  Everything is good quality and the case is also really nice.  The only problem is that they are not quite sure what each thing is for.  A little instruction kit would be nice.</li>
    <li> Half of instruments do not work properly as well as lock of the box. Returned this cheap quality manicure set back at the same day.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed when I received this product. It was delivered to me broken and the latch will not stay closed.</li>
    <li> It is cheaply made. Not as good as the one I lost. It&#x27;s OK but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is affordable and great quality</li>
    <li> Just the ticket for tough nails that defy regular clippers. These are VERY sharp so be careful using them as they cut quickly and easily with little pressure. I especially like the nippers that cut curved nails like mine that are impossible to trim with regular flat clippers.</li>
    <li> Nice set .everything has a place.</li>
    <li> Good quality and fits perfectly into my personal hygiene bag. I travel all of the time and it is nice to have all the tools I may need in one place and secure.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time, this is nothing but JUNK.... Tools are not Sharp enough and some of the tools are made incorrectly.  Case looks nice but the tool holding pockets and slats are falling apart, especially the snap button.  Terrible Quality Control.</li>
    <li> All the tools and more (have no idea what half of them do) for a great price!!!! Went to local walgreens and just for 2 clippers (one for fingernails and one for toenails) was almost 12 bucks!!!!!!! Told myself probably could get one better online sure enough, here they are.</li>
    <li> Very nice set, especially for the money.</li>
    <li> The product is perfect and it was delivered in one day, which surprised me much~</li>
    <li> This is the lowest quality garbage. You&#x27;re better off biting your fingernails.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good set! All of the tools seem like they are really good quality and they will last a while.  They are very sharp and sturdy. The reason I gave 4 stars is because the case was not in very good condition.  It seems worn out and dingy. The tools also do not fit in it very well. Shipping was fast and overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with the set.</li>
    <li> not verygood.broken 2 ready.</li>
    <li> Good quality at good price.</li>
    <li> Great set but the case is flimsy considering all of the items it has to hold.</li>
    <li> Great item functional. The material is much better as I had thought and it arrived in 2 days sooner than predicted. Which was a surprise. Its handy to have all the items in a case. I recommend you to get it. O paid 7 dollars with free shipping! not even bad.</li>
    <li> Actual tools were of lower quality than I would have liked.</li>
    <li> Everything you need for cheap</li>
    <li> Great set  and everything you need for a great price. Delivered as promised. Love it.</li>
    <li> Nice size, easy to keep stored.  Not sure just what some of these tools are for!  But the ones I&#x27;ve used work just fine.</li>
    <li> Excellent set of useful items at a great price. I bought this for home use &amp; am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Love this kit. I haven&#x27;t used all of the tools yet, but the ones I have are nice and sharp. I really like the clippers that are angled. The one thing I would improve on is the grip, maybe by adding a small amount of rubber.</li>
    <li> This kit comes in a very nice, sturdy, strong case with a clasp that stays closed. You can put this in your purse and not worry about the contents spilling out and you don&#x27;t have to dig around trying to find anything. The price is excellent. I&#x27;d pay this much for just one of the tools inside at a drugstore. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Cheap case, good stainless steel tools.</li>
    <li> Nice high quality Set</li>
    <li> Love how strong these tools are. They come in handy all the time because I am constantly cutting my nails!</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT ONE FOR MYSELF AND LIKED IT SO MUCH I BOUGHT ONE AS A GIFT.</li>
    <li> Awful. There was film all over the tools that was coming off upon arrival; I don;t even know what it was. The tweezers left black marks all over my fingers and smell like metal and leave your fingers black and smelling like metal. Items are crappier quality than the cheapest items in the drugstore.</li>
    <li> Far better quality than I expected for the price</li>
    <li> Gave this to my husband and he loved it!. Great looking, great case.</li>
    <li> Great set. Quality tools. The case closes well. Good value for the price. I would definitely buy this set again.</li>
    <li> This is a great kit just to have, has everything you need to keep your nails trimmed and looking good.</li>
    <li> While I dont care much for the cuticle piece It does what it is supposed to do and I really cant complain</li>
    <li> cant beat this price..everything great quality!</li>
    <li> For the price I paid for everything that&#x27;s included in this kit ($8.08 and free shipping), I have to be honest - I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be very good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I was pleasantly surprised! This is actually a nice little kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manicure tools have a matte finish &amp;#34;brushed steel&amp;#34; look and somehow it just makes them look much nicer than if they were shiny metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They seem to be quite well made and sturdy. The case is cute and snaps together well. I&#x27;ll probably take most of the items out and just use the case for travel travel - it would fit a short eyeliner pencil, small makeup tools, maybe small eyeshadow, tweezers, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not really sure who would need 3 nail clippers, but the price and quality looks good and I would have purchased it even if there were 0 nail clippers. I basically got it for the little scissors - I probably would have paid the same price at the drugstore for a pair of sturdy little scissors, but instead I got a whole set!</li>
    <li> SUPER SHARP and SOOOOOOOOO WORTH THE PRICE &amp; the case is nice too!</li>
    <li> Too small.  I gave it away.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS KIT! I have been looking for something of this porportion for a long time. Everything works great and I love the fact they are stainless.</li>
    <li> Great set for the price</li>
    <li> In only a couple of weeks the case tore apart in front. The ears of the scissors are too sharp and will hurt your fingers when working with it.</li>
    <li> Works great, speedy delivery, comes in a cute case too!</li>
    <li> good quality dont know why some reviews did not like it but all in my set came and it was great</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t cut my cuticle :)) Returned right away</li>
    <li> It was exactly how the picture looks. Everything is in great condition and very sharp. Also came very fast, I would definitely recommend this to someone else!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok but better quality is missing</li>
    <li> What a great little case that has all the tools I need.  I do not know what else to write...this product is great.</li>
    <li> Includes just about everything for basic nail care that you will need. Quality is very good. Everything works well. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my brother as a gift and he really likes it.can&#x27;t stop thanking me about it.and its compact.</li>
    <li> Interesting combination of things I can use on my fingers and toes!  There are some items in this pack that I can get creative with, but back to my mani-pedi...  One item looks like I could use it on my dogs claws; another looked like a miniature ice pick with a tiny shovel...  I&#x27;m not sure yet how to use these things, but I&#x27;m very certain that I&#x27;m going to have a lot of fun and make good use of them.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with product.</li>
    <li> Nice product for such an affordable price!</li>
    <li> Tools seem to work ok. However, the box holding the tools does not hold them tight. Its so badly constructed that some of the tools feel out of the box during shipping. Very cheap quality stuff. I would not buy these again ever.</li>
    <li> Very cheap for everything that is included</li>
    <li> Workmanship is very bad!</li>
    <li> CAN NOT BEAT THE PRICE OR QUALITY</li>
    <li> This is a great product...everything you need and it all fits nicely in the case.  Great value!</li>
    <li> Great kit , strong and durable. I have thick toe nails and have broke a few pairs of nail clippers. Love the detail, and quality.</li>
    <li> This is amazing.  This has everything you need for manicure and pedicure.  So, no more going to pay for it at the salons.  I now will do my daughter&#x27;s manicure and pedicure and she loves it because she still gets to relax.  Every product is perfect and sharp!</li>
    <li> good quality with the price</li>
    <li> Good quality kit, better that i expected.No complaints.</li>
    <li> Tools are decent, but the case is junk!</li>
    <li> The product it&#x27;s ok, the nail clipper are good and so is the rest of the kit, except for the cuticle nipper. If you are buying this for the cuticle nipper I&#x27;d recommend you to not do so since it&#x27;s extremely cheap and it broke after using it 1 time; otherwise an okay product for the prince, but if you want something durable, spend a little bit of extra money.</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made. The big nail clipper fell apart at the first time that I tried to use it.</li>
    <li> A really nice set that has all the tools you need. Nice case too.</li>
    <li> Good quality stuff here. Especially for the price; considering that the cuticle trimmers alone are usually more expensive!&lt;br /&gt;Nice case, and really much better quality tools than I had expected. Just buy it. It would make a great gift too fyi ;)</li>
    <li> Not what do you expect!</li>
    <li> This is a very good kit.  It provides what I need at a good price.  The tools feel light weight compared to the one I had previously.  They do the job though.  I&#x27;d recommend these.</li>
    <li> The tools are good, but the case and latch system don&#x27;t work....I have to rubber band it shut.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t cut cuticle with the cuticle scissors</li>
    <li> This was given as a gift and I haven&#x27;t stop getting thanked for it. She absolutely loved and and uses it vertully everyday.</li>
    <li> Good product, delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Lots of tools, and they all seem to work great.  Case is made very durable.  Good value for your money.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this product. The tools are pretty poor quality. I would pay a couple extra bucks for a nicer set.</li>
    <li> It doesnt look cheap. For the price, this set as everything  i need for maintaining  my nails, and my husband&#x27;s .  It&#x27;s  stainless steel so it seemed to withstand constant sterilization  without  concern for rust.</li>
    <li> Gave this set to my husband because he kept stealing mine.  He loves it!</li>
    <li> By tweezerman instead, these things are fairly stiff and the case is cheap... You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a friend for Christmas. She absolutely loves it. She said she can&#x27;t keep other family members from stealing it. It is a very good quality product. I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Hard to use, too rough, but nail clippers work great.</li>
    <li> The product seems to be very good, but one of the tools came broke.. They&#x27;re very strong and heavy.</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t know how to open it but I figured it out. Great price.</li>
    <li> I was going to buy the same item for 9.99 on Rankuten(buy.com) and thought about checking whether Amazon had it and yes...it was available!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought it and obviously Primed it and got it a couple of days later, I wanted to have an extra one that I could carry with me in case I need it, which happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I opened it (nice packaging by the way) there was some stickiness on the case (which is ok in reality) but the issues were the case not closing correctly (the contents were propping a gap on the case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest issue was the quality of the instruments. The nail scissors are tough to do precision cutting, issues with the manufacturing and finish. I figure I can try to get a refund but for six bucks It&#x27;s not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heed my advice, don&#x27;t get this!</li>
    <li> Some of the instruments are not sharp and very dull</li>
    <li> Of all my purchases on Amazon, this one is by far my favorite. This se includes all the essentials for proper nail maintenance. The tools are stainless steel, sharp, and aesthetically pleasing. They come in an attractive metal case couches in faux leather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying more of these to serve as stocking stuffers this year--highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> It is exactly what you expect it!</li>
    <li> This is a great manicure pedicure set.</li>
    <li> Vary poor quality. The cuticle stripper doesn&#x27;t even work. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Nice everything you need for a good manicure!</li>
    <li> This has anything that you need to get the job done for pedicure. They are sturdy and in a well organized case.</li>
    <li> Gotta get more of these so my family will leave mine alone.</li>
    <li> For as little as you pay for this thing, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;No, it&#x27;s no the best quality BUT everything works! It&#x27;ll get the job done for sure and it seems like it&#x27;ll last a long time too.</li>
    <li> Tools are cheap And broke easy</li>
    <li> Could us a little instruction on how to use everything that came in the kit.  Everything looks very professional (high quality).</li>
    <li> alittle on the cheap side as far as quality</li>
    <li> really good mani and pedi set</li>
    <li> These are very good cutting and etc.</li>
    <li> Got this for my son.  He loves it.  Great guy gift.  The tools are well crafted and sturdy.  This set does not look cheap.</li>
    <li> Not a clean cut. Leaves edges of nails Jaggard. Not a good buy.</li>
    <li> I received the correct item but the wrong color.</li>
    <li> Love it. Works well. Comes in a very cute bag and it arrived in two days after I ordered. The only thing I would tell you if you have big hands like if you are tall and your hands are huge then you should think about buying it. They are a little small than the normal size we find at the store, but this is a Aslan product and it&#x27;s made for their hands size. But works pretty well. My sister-in-law has big hands she found it small, but again she is 6&#x27;05&amp;#34; :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought nail products before that weren&#x27;t sharp enough and left jagged edges.  These worked perfectly and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> all of the tools feel cheap! they work... but have a very cheap look and feel. delivery was ok, but was well packaged. i would not purchase this again! if you are going to spend your money on one of these, definitely dont get this set! my case is starting to come apart also! and i have only had it a few months, and do not use it often!</li>
    <li> When I got them, they were lightly covered by metal dust. Like they just came off the assembly line. No big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set just isn&#x27;t sharp enough.&lt;br /&gt;The clippers are barely sharp enough for nails, but the other stuff will tug and pull at your cuticles and what not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Looks good. One of the tools was loose and fell out when I opened it. Ended up cutting myself.</li>
    <li> These are small and uncomfortable to use.</li>
    <li> Love this kit! I received the order quickly and with no problems. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Stainless steel, sharp clipper blades, nice case.  Super deal.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing like stainless, you just don&#x27;t have to worry about it much.  Best alloy on earth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it.  I don&#x27;t know what half of the tools are for but some day maybe I&#x27;ll figure that out or have a use for them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but not better than the one I used before...</li>
    <li> Does what I need it to do. Looks cool too.</li>
    <li> great size for my purse thanx</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quite nice and has every tool</li>
    <li> Great kit for the money. Sturdy and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> The manicure set was cheaply made and looked like it will rust fast. I didn&#x27;t even want to use any of the things in it. It&#x27;s better to add more money and buy a good quality product.</li>
    <li> This is  an excellent quality product that works well.  No concerns.</li>
    <li> better than expected. Great little kit, I love it.</li>
    <li> Metals are very cheap and the case didn&#x27;t close without difficulty.&lt;br /&gt;Probably OK if you&#x27;re on a tight budget but, spend a little more and&lt;br /&gt;get something that will last.</li>
    <li> Great men Gift. The quality is good. :)</li>
    <li> The delivery took a long time, but the product is of good quality. I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
    <li> very bad quality, the cuticle trimmer broke immediately when i used it</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful addition to my travel pack.  I have everything I will need in case of an emergency all in one convenient carrying case. Nice sturdy, durable case with everything organized and ready for use.  There is even a side clasp that holds it shut when not being used.</li>
    <li> great item. got item on time</li>
    <li> I never thought I would leave a product review for something like this, but this kit is awesome. For the price, I was surprised with the quality. The case is great quality and looks nice. Clasps well. The items inside are all good quality. Metal, not flimsy. Sharp, not dull. I use this all the time. It is so convenient and nice. Tools for everything you could ever need for grooming. Everyone should have one of these and its so affordable!</li>
    <li> Very good features and price. To be recommended. You won&#x27;t find this at your corner store.</li>
    <li> PURCHASED AS A GIFT FOR SOMEONE.  THEY LOVED IT!</li>
    <li> These are sharp and easy to handle. Cleanning and trimming is a breese. This is the one if you are in NEED!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Very good. Shipped fast.</li>
    <li> I saw allt he great reviews and bought these. It arrived in an attractive case and that case was full of all sorts of tools. They are sharp enough to cut nails. But the things I did not like are a) the clippers have squared of somewhat sharp corners. You have to hold it right so that you don&#x27;t get an uncomfortable poke in your fingers when you press to cut.  b) the large nail clipper has a &amp;#34;deformed&amp;#34; rivet that holds the thin side and lets it turn around to open or close. This caused the handle get hung up in the rivet hole. I managed to force it out, but don&#x27;t know how long it will last because there is a metal on metal grinding when I turn it. It&#x27;s not smooth.  c) the set had a heavy smell of fuel oil or something petroleum which after a month has faded.  d) I have small hands and the clippers seem out of proportion. I can use them, but it&#x27;s not a comfortable to do so as with other sets.</li>
    <li> Nice set, very handy and easy to carry anywhere. Good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> The tools are good. The case is not. Falling apart day one. However, if you don&#x27;t care about that. It&#x27;s cheap with decent products. Not the best quality you will ever have, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> The nail cutter broke first time My wife used it, try putting the screw back but no luck.</li>
    <li> Everything you need in one small box.  Small and good to take when traveling.</li>
    <li> Quality isn&#x27;t the best, but for the price you can&#x27;t complain. Comes with more than I would really need, but again, I can&#x27;t complain because of the price. If you need a decent quality kit for travel or for regular use, this is it.</li>
    <li> These are good tools for the most part.  The only issue I have is with how they are held in the case.  It is difficult to remove some of the tools to use.</li>
    <li> Nice kit with good quality tools in a well built case.</li>
    <li> Good quality without being too heavy. Items are sharp and get the job done. The case is of nice quality also.</li>
    <li> The scissors and angle clippers, the two instruments I use most, tend to chew the nails and skin rather than to cut. They are simply too flimsy to have a good cutting edge.</li>
    <li> I took out the few things I wanted and gave the rest to my girlfriend.  she seemed to think it was great.</li>
    <li> Great product with great selections of tools however the case fell apart in no time...........sad face.</li>
    <li> Decent product considering the price! But don&#x27;t expect quality equipment as they feel somewhat cheap and fragile, though they do get the job done. The leather case is quite elegant, but know that the red leather strips inside that are used to hold the items in place are practically paper and can be ripped quite easily when removing or putting one of the utensils back into the strip. This can be especially problematic when you want to use the push sticks since they&#x27;re pretty long thus they&#x27;re hard to remove without ripping the strips.</li>
    <li> good craftsman and a very good product</li>
    <li> The pouch is nice but that is the only good thing I can say about it.  The tools are cheap and don&#x27;t work.  The metal is too flexible so tools are able to bend instead of staying in position to be able to work.  The pouch is good but since you are most likely buying for the tools, it is a waste of money.  I plan to keep the pouch and replace the tools as the pouch appears solid and will keep all my tools easily available when I go on trips.  Do not buy if you want the tools, buy if you have or plan to buy the tools and want a carrying case.</li>
    <li> Makes me feel like inspector gadget.</li>
    <li> none of the items is sharp...useless</li>
    <li> Great deal!!! Look and works great!</li>
    <li> I bought this fully expecting it to be kind of crappy and cheap and much to my surprise it was actually really good quality. The clippers are all great and very nice feel to them. I know its just a mani/pedi kit but my wife and I really think this is a fantastic value.</li>
    <li> Some of the tools come apart very easily and they are not very sharp.</li>
    <li> The nail clippers are not sharp - I don&#x27;t have thick nails and these don&#x27;t cut them. The baby&#x27;s soft nail cutters work better. Meanwhile, the file is so sharp that it has cut me 3 times in the last 2 times I&#x27;ve used it. I like the size of the kit, the variety of the tools, and the idea of having a small kit on-the-go, but I&#x27;m not super impressed by the tools.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and functional. Love that each piece has a holder.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe all that you get for the price of this!?  It is incredible!  It seems super high quality for the price point.  It would make a great little gift for someone and they&#x27;d seriously think you had paid 5x the price that you actually paid!  I&#x27;m not even sure what all of these little tools do because there are so many.  You will not be disappointed with this set.</li>
    <li> opened it once - it never closed again</li>
    <li> The case is a little cheap feeling and doesn&#x27;t close well but for the price it&#x27;s a great purchase</li>
    <li> More like aluminum foil than stainless steel.  Also, too many implements instead of a few of good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy.</li>
    <li> Amazing amazing for the price. Good quality for the price. Best 6 dollars spent on a manicure set.</li>
    <li> good shipping.  average quality or slightly better.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made and some of the contents were already covered with surface rust when it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money, do not buy!!</li>
    <li> Bought as gifts for men at my church. The housing was very nice. The tools were acceptable. Great gift</li>
    <li> I love this little set and especially the price. Everything I need is in it and I love the quality.</li>
    <li> It works fine. They are cheap but do their job. The case makes it easy to use and put away. I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> It came in a beaten-up faded red and gold box with Chinese writing on it, authenticating it&#x27;s origin.  It also arrived with the case open.  Everything was in there and the quality looked okay.  After switching things around like a monkey in a monkey trap I have concluded that the case will not close unless you take the toenail clippers out.  So far, I&#x27;ve only used the fingernail clippers and they seem sharp.  As I intended to keep this kit in my shaving case, having the toenail clipper separate from the rest of the set doesn&#x27;t pose a problem.  Hold back one star for a case that&#x27;s too thin.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s the purpose I bought it for, lots of different tools to take care of both your feet and hands</li>
    <li> This will last forever---unless some get lost!</li>
    <li> Sounded good until I got it. Made of steele. Cut my nails and left them jagged, I threw it away the next day. Would not recommend</li>
    <li> Great kit! Had to have my girlfriend explain what most of it was.</li>
    <li> Some of the tools aren&#x27;t polished, meaning the edges have small metal burrs. For the price I was willing to sand down the edges with a nail file.</li>
    <li> Basically the same issues everyone faced regarding the small nail clip is the same issue I have with this case. Received all pieces and the case closes ok with no problems. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace set lost during Hurricane Sandy. Very happy with kit, in fact I just ordered another as a present for a friend. The set works well, contains all tools I need to do my nails, etc. Hey, for six bucks how can you go wrong!</li>
    <li> good value for the price</li>
    <li> Mine came with the thread unraveling in the stiches already.  Not a very good quality.  But you get what you pay for.  Was supposed to be red and black mine is orange, I hate orange. lol c</li>
    <li> It has everything I was looking for, and more. I&#x27;ve had this for several months and everything is still holding up. The case doesn&#x27;t completely close, but it is enough to just stay latched. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a bargain!</li>
    <li> Good price but can feel like it isnt&#x27; strong at times. It still works and is able to cut hard nails.</li>
    <li> The Stainless Steel Manicure Pedicure Set Is very good quality and comes in a sturdy case. The tools seam to be high grade,</li>
    <li> This set is wonderful. Everything is well-made. I&#x27;ve paid the same amount for just a pair of nail clippers and had them fall apart within a week. Every item in this kit seems to be of high quality and I doubt anything will be falling apart any time soon.</li>
    <li> My fiance loved this surprise</li>
    <li> The case is super cheap and lame, the tools are super quality and work perfectly.  Happy I purchased it</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Seems to be good quality. Gives a clean smooth cut. If I only knew what most of the kit was...</li>
    <li> After it got there, seems like a decent set.  The clippers cut cleanly and there are more tools in it than I have a clue what they are for.  Nice package with a padding case.  Easy to find and use.</li>
    <li> great for back up implement has everything plus more</li>
    <li> not easy to hang on to and i am a little disappointed. also they r hard to get out of their places in the kit.</li>
    <li> I have used it a lot.</li>
    <li> Ordered this as a stocking stuffer for my daughter and she liked it.</li>
    <li> it is ok. not the best I had, but for the price pretty good</li>
    <li> Good quality.  My husband is happy with it.</li>
    <li> Since I paid under $10 I expect what I got. The clippers are somewhat sharp but stiff. The scissors are very sharp. All and all this kit gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this purchase was a great price very quick shipping and delivery thank you</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a nice manicure set to use each day, this one might not be the best. However if you are looking for an affordable set as a back up or for traveling, this one would probably be good enough for most people. The case fairly well made although it is a little tight and difficult to close. Aside from the fact that you have to squish it closed its actually pretty nice and functional. The individual tools inside are usable but not fine quality. all the implements inside have roughly machined edges. These can be a bit rough on your hands and nails but if you really have a bad hang nail or need some clippers these will get the job done. I smoothed the rough edges on mine using a buffing wheel which made it much better. It took minimal effort on my side and the set was 7 bucks and shipped for free with one of my other orders so all things considered I feel it is worth 4 stars. But if you don&#x27;t want to correct the minor problems with it and want something that works great right out of the box you may want to shop for something a little more high end.</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t expect the tip top best. It would be like going to Little Ceasars and expecting gourmet pizza. It&#x27;s just not going to happen. But for the price, these are the best. Everything cuts the best and came as described. Some complain about the set not closing properly but that may be cause you have to check that things aren&#x27;t colliding. Overall, one of the best manicure sets for the price.</li>
    <li> On first impression, this is an attractive set. That is, it looks good. Performance is another matter. The case is probably the best item in the set. There are lots of mysterious items here that look like they could be use by a small animal veterinarian.  I tried the small nail clipper and found it inferior to the one I already had. It didn&#x27;t clip cleanly or sharply. The metal it is made of seems to have flexibility in it, unlike American-made clippers. Oh, yeah, these are made in China.</li>
    <li> Beyond bad. While the case is nice, the clippers are so dull and the levers so flimsy, it takes several tries before you can get it to clip one fingernail. And forget about using it for toenails.  I got what I paid for. Cheap Chinese junk.  I had ordered similar sets in the past from another online retailer for a similar price, and they worked beautifully, but these are duds.</li>
    <li> Great assortment of tools</li>
    <li> Excellent value for the price and shipping.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly well made. sharp, nice set very functional. way to go China!</li>
    <li> Do yourself a favor and ignore the negitive reviews.  This is a quality product delivered by a supplier in record time.  The detractors are either competitors or idiots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Super Sharp grooming instruments made of lightweight metal that seem sturdy and durable.&lt;br /&gt;Super fast delivery (one day in my case)&lt;br /&gt;Great case with old-world compression latch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: No instructions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes: This kit comes with all the instruments you might need of fine nail grooming.  It also comes with four instruments that might puzzle the novice:&lt;br /&gt;Ear Scoop - used to extract wax or other obstructions from ear canal. Use carefully!&lt;br /&gt;Cuticle Scalpel - Used to trim cuticles. Used on others, do not use on self.&lt;br /&gt;Cuticle Gouge - Used to trim cuticles.  Use carefully after receiving personal instruction from manicurist.  Misuse is dangerous and can produce profuse bleeding and pain beyond levels normally anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;Offset Clippers - used to trim off hangnails or overgrown nails in hard-to-reach areas.  Use with great care and at own peril.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:  This is a pro-level kit with enough hardware to do yourself serious harm. It can NOT be beat for the price.  Chinese manufacturer with a  German build feel.  I&#x27;d give it six stars if I could.</li>
    <li> Overall: it&#x27;s good except the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like&lt;br /&gt;- The most of the tools are really good for use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislike&lt;br /&gt;- The case is really cheap one. You can&#x27;t even fully close it.</li>
    <li> Great quality and nice price</li>
    <li> My wife says the cuticle cutters are too small and could be sharper.  Scissors don&#x27;t work well either.  The other items have not been used.</li>
    <li> Very handle on my recent cruise.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend never wants to get his nails done with me so I needed a nail kit to do his myself. This is affordable and the tools are good quality stainless steel. The thread work holding the tools looks a little poor but I&#x27;m careful when I remove them. They work great! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> This rusts super easy.</li>
    <li> The product is great. The price is very reasonable and it arrived fast. My wife and I each purchased a set and each of us love how they work along with the carrying case.</li>
    <li> Amazing product for the price. I love it. A handy kit</li>
    <li> Not great by any means. Sharp enough for a few uses. Case probably costs more than whole set.</li>
    <li> Nice design and good material</li>
    <li> Sometimes tear the nails instead of cutting</li>
    <li> Made in China and quality is not good enough</li>
    <li> Now every item I ever will need is in one place!!!  Great set!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great, high quality manicure set. I&#x27;ve bought 4 of them now, for myself and as gifts for others. Great price for a great product.</li>
    <li> Item was as exactly as pictured.  The case quality is higher than I expected, and is actually really nice and soft to the touch.  The tools are sharp and do the job well.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recomend very cheap mad</li>
    <li> Nail clipper broke after one use. Cheaply made. Will return.</li>
    <li> Came with nail pieces in the case, even though it says to be new! :/</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying, I don&#x27;t think I should have expected much for this price. Even though, this is one of those things that just feels like a waste of $. None of the tools are sturdy or effective. The nail clippers don&#x27;t cut well &amp; the nails fly everywhere. The cuticle clipper doesn&#x27;t clip! Super annoying and useless. I did use what I thought was the pusher and that worked well but I felt if I spent $5 on a single 2 sided pusher, I&#x27;d have been happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is awesome but the quality and usefulness of this product just isn&#x27;t worth anything. If you are going to take the time weekly to give yourself a manicure, I think it&#x27;s worth investing a little bit more in quality products. Don&#x27;t need all these tools either, only a few are practical.</li>
    <li> looks good in the picture, but a little bit far from my expect</li>
    <li> This is actually an okay quality and I have found it super convenient to carry with me places.</li>
    <li> Though the case is not as high quality as pictured, or even the case pictured but the products inside are good.  Case does not look or feel sturdy, and gives you the feel it is cheap and whatever inside is cheap.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Much heavier and stronger than clippers found in the discount bin at the drug store.</li>
    <li> I was really looking for a pair of cuticle cutters when I came across this product. because of the price, the descriptions and other reviews I did purchase the whole set thinking I would replace my other tools. it arrived on time and the case is beautiful however, after using the cuticle cutters twice they broke and the case is starting to come apart. As for the other tools inside I haven&#x27;t really gotten to use the rest yet I did use a nail file and wound up cutting my finger because all of the tools are very thin and made of metal, so if you&#x27;re not paying attention like me you&#x27;ll whined  up cutting yourself too. when I first received it I was pleased at the way it looks and thought it would be a nice gift for someone else after the tool broke I got cut and the case came apart I would not recommend buying.</li>
    <li> Very low quality, clippers not sharp enough to clip. Case latch is flimsy. Looked good in the product description but a big disappointment. Will probably throw it away.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it much, but the finger nail clippers seem heavy duty. It looks exactly like the photo. And it arrived on time! I do really like the case.</li>
    <li> Good set and easy to use and carry !!</li>
    <li> Instruments not that sharp.&lt;br /&gt;Better look at these kits in person.&lt;br /&gt;Drug stores carry really high end nail cutters and kits.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great kit to have around the house. Works great for manicures, even if you&#x27;re a beginner. The case is sturdy, and you can close it if you rearrange a couple of things. Although one of the nail clippers wasn&#x27;t sharp enough. But overall I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> But I will say I&#x27;ve had higher quality products in the past. I doubt this kit would hold up to extended use. But its nice to use when I go on vacation or can&#x27;t find my good nail clippers.</li>
    <li> Gives you every took you could possibly need.  Cute case.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. These are very cheap for a reason. One of the clippers has burs on the cutting edge! Horrible.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with my order</li>
    <li> Great product good quality extremely sharp</li>
    <li> I just bought one. It should have ten pieces, but I got only nine.</li>
    <li> I feel a less masculine cleaning my nails up, as I have been a chronic nail biter my entire life but the trade off is well worth it. I look less dirty and more professional with well-manicured nails.</li>
    <li> Nice looking set with cool case. Price is great. The set has everything you would want in a manicure pack.</li>
    <li> The tweezers were horrible, I had to buy a new one.The rest were alright.</li>
    <li> great for traveling. Good quality tools.</li>
    <li> I returned these and did  not exchange them because when I opened the box, the trim was already coming off the case. This didn&#x27;t seem to be shipping damage (box was fine), just not a very well-made product.</li>
    <li> Heavy steel set. Lots of tool options for different needs.</li>
    <li> High quality beautiful design</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. The item arrived sooner than expected which was a good thing. It is exactly as described and in good condition. The product is good quality and all parts work well.</li>
    <li> really great, the tools are sharp and they get the job done, even though i have no idea what some of them are and what they are meant to do.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Item came quickly but looks used. The tools do not stay in the elastic holders and the material they are made of &#x27;stains&#x27; (for lack of a better word) the inside of the case. Cheap quality product.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas stocking stuffer for my husband; he absolutely loves it. It has a masculine feel to it and we love that it is stainless steel. The clippers are quite sharp and exactly what we were looking for. The seller shipped very quickly; it arrived in just a couple of weeks - I was surprised &amp; very happy that it arrived before the suggested time frame. I bought a different manicure set for my son, but he wants this one because of the appearance, durability and the handsome case. So I&#x27;ll be ordering a couple more - want to keep one on hand for when a quick gift is needed.</li>
    <li> The case itself is worth what I paid for the entire kit. The stainless steel items are a nice quality, some minor rough edges on like on the end of the file. The only complaint I have is that the clippers could be a little sharper. Cutting through my nails I end up getting little frayed ends.</li>
    <li> Quality kit for the price. Had everything i needed. (I do my own pedi and manis now for the most part, and these have just about everything i need). I had a better kit but it was about 5x the price. If you are on a budget and want a reliable kit this is a good purchase.</li>
    <li> I find it hard to believe this is actually stainless steel. The case is falling apart and hard to get top stay closed, every time I try to use the tweezers they deform, staying closer together than they were before. Everything else works though. Considering the price though, I&#x27;d probably still recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use these every time I clip mine/ my husbands/ or  my grandmother&#x27;s fingers/toes!  They are a wonderful set.  The only thing I would say is that even the tweezers are sharp.  Tried to pluck my eyebrows a few times and the tweezers just clip them off...Over all good quality set</li>
    <li> Too many pieces, but a great kit.</li>
    <li> I got this the other day and I thought it was great until I came to do the review.  When I received it there were 2 slots with nothing in them.  I thought they were for in case you wanted to put something else in there, but now looking at the picture again, I realize that it is two tools that are missing. Oh well. Now I will say this, if you order and get everything that is supposed to be there, then it is great for traveling, which is why I bought it.</li>
    <li> A great kit fot all the trimming stuff we do in life.</li>
    <li> Great set! However, the sound it makes when the tools accidentally touch one another makes me cringe. The material they are made out of isn&#x27;t the highest quality. Overall, it has a decent price tag and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> while the items inside the kit are great for manicure/pedicure tools, the actual kit appeared sturday, however upon opening it for the first time and admiring the tools inside.  I closed the hard container and when I tried to reopen it to show the tools inside it got stuck and it was unable to be opened by pressing the button.  It took me sticking a phillips screwdriver and a pair of scissors to pry it open , ultimately once it opened the entire shell of the container fell apart.  NOw I have no storage for the wonderful tools inside.  Very disappointing.  Just saying, if you order this set be sure to have a back up container to store the goodies inside because the storage box really sucks.</li>
    <li> I gave it away as a gift.</li>
    <li> EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS. IT IS A GREAT BUY</li>
    <li> This is a great set! I can&#x27;t believe you can get all of this for such a low price.  Excellent quality.</li>
    <li> Great all around seller, price</li>
    <li> It said, in the description, manicure set for men. The case looks like something a woman would use (not solid color as advertised). But the main complaint is the case will not stay shut. I had meant to send it back, but I forget about it until I got an email asking me to review it. I guess it is too late now. The tools feel heavy duty &amp; will probably work fine. Maybe I will find a small case &amp; keep them for myself (I had bought it for a gift).</li>
    <li> Lovely case and great tools! But I&#x27;m not a manicurist. I don&#x27;t use these daily. I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and sometimes I need them. They work great!</li>
    <li> I love this everything works very good.</li>
    <li> More tools than I will ever use but nice quality and neat case</li>
    <li> Everything you would ever need all in one place. High quality material and rigid. Look forward to using it.</li>
    <li> I give it 3 stars. Case is nicely make but some of the tools are cheap. The nail cleaner and file, bends so it&#x27;s not strong an will break. The pedicure is nice and so are the nail cuters. I haven&#x27;t tried the others yet but it seems the ones that are flat are cheap there other ones seem strong. If you have you own file etc. buy it and put yours in it.</li>
    <li> Great quality product! All items are much better than expected for such a low price. Would recommend the product</li>
    <li> very sharp and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I gave two stars because there are a lot of pieces, a case, low price and no hassle return. That being said, I did returned it.  I was waiting patiently for it to arrive as I was away from home and in need of clippers badly!  I opened the case, grabbed the clippers, and much to my dismay the would NOT clip my nails :( They were as dull as a butter knife!  Clippers that won&#x27;t clip were of no use to me.  Seller promptly authorized return and refunded in full.</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s a good set.  I got tired of trying to hunt down parts my kids would leave everywhere.  I told them they touch my kit it was going to be a bad evening for someone.</li>
    <li> Great nail grooming kit that comes with most of the tools need for your at home grooming.</li>
    <li> Includes every nail implement you would need, but they are not the best of quality. They don&#x27;t cut very well, but the kit looks really nice</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a low cost kit, and I think it&#x27;s just fine. I&#x27;ve read a lot of these negative reviews on Amazon, and I think there are too many peoiple who are overly harsh and way to critical. Maybe because their jobs are that way, and they take it out on Amazon forums? I don&#x27;t know, but it seems like a disease with some of the comments I read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail clippers work just fine. The twisers are OK too. The file is low cost, about what I expected for the price paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great Amazon value especially for us Prime customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Five star review</li>
    <li> For the price AND quality, I could not find a comparable product.&lt;br /&gt;Very well manufactured and extremely sharp.&lt;br /&gt;Not really sure what a few of the items can be used for?</li>
    <li> Love it, use the manicure set often to clean out my nails.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly good quality set for a very reasonable price.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> Tough steel. These do not bend at all. Much better than anything I&#x27;ve bought before for cutting my male tough toenails. As a male, I don&#x27;t know what half the tools are for, but for the price, I didn&#x27;t mind getting all the extra little things.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price. Everything was made well and looks very pretty</li>
    <li> This is a good set with many items; quality seems to be OK.  Not as fancy or as pricey as some.</li>
    <li> Like this a lot . Well made</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not very good quality, but for that price is ok</li>
    <li> Feels weird when you use the nail clipper to cut. Doesn&#x27;t give a nice clean &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; sound, as if the blades are not sharp enough.  It&#x27;s made from China, so of course the quality is not that good. One good thing is that when you hold the clipper, your fingers doesn&#x27;t slide down since it has ridges to prevent from sliding while cutting.  Didn&#x27;t use the other things in there since there&#x27;s no need.  I would rather buy the single nail clipper from other sellers/products.</li>
    <li> These are not flimsy tools — high quality, sturdy, and sharp. Very pleased. My only complaint is that the leather from the top of the box is pulling away from the edges, but since I&#x27;m not carrying this around, it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like this but it&#x27;s my fault.  I know that you get what you pay for.  The tools are clumsy and hard to use and quite cheap.</li>
    <li> Bought these for the cuticle trimmers and tweezers. But best quality, guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This is the best grooming kit I have ever owned. Very well made and an excellent price.</li>
    <li> I bought this Stainless Steel Manicure Pedicure set and I really like because you can sterilize it after each use and carry it everywhere.  It was worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> The tools have a masculine machine quality to them and work well (though I wish there were instructions for them as I don&#x27;t know what half of them are for) But just the clippers, file and tweezers make this a bargain. The case is a nice touch and keeps everything handy in my Dopp Kit. Looks classy too. Only complaint is the clippers make it a bit hard to close but it is a minor inconvenience. Love this.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and found some of the pieces loose in the box. The V-shaped tools was completely missing and I would have to pay to return it. They would not simply replace the missing item.</li>
    <li> This little case is solid and handsomely put together. I can&#x27;t figure out what all the thin little tools are and I would have preferred a tweezer instead of the very smallest clipper which was hard for me to use. This is a great travel set for the money.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Just as described.</li>
    <li> Some of the tools are a little loose, but overall a good kit.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sis, she likes them she had no complains about them at all.</li>
    <li> A good, fairly comprehensive kit. High quality pieces. The nail file is the low point, but at the price it&#x27;s a minor gripe</li>
    <li> Lots of pieces but the important ones are poor quality. If you already have decent clippers and scissors and want a new, not bad case and a bunch of picks, files and scrapy things, then have at it.</li>
    <li> Is good for the price</li>
    <li> Great set, includes almost everything but a buffing tool</li>
    <li> Cheaply made, one of the inside holders ripped when I tried to get the cuticle pusher out the first time.</li>
    <li> great kit for travel.  Very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Great product</li>
    <li> love it! nice quality.</li>
    <li> The set looks nice, but the equipment is cheap.  My husband had a hard time getting nice clips on his nails.  A bit of a disappointment, the good reviews had me convinced it was a decent set, but it turned out not as good as I thought.</li>
    <li> Really happy with my purchase, may even order a 2nd for my daughter.  Not sure if I&#x27;ll use the earwax remover tool (seems a bit barbaric) but I do like everything else, and really like the case (it has an &amp;#34;M&amp;#34; on the front with is perfect due to my last name).</li>
    <li> Nail file has really sharp edges. Cut my finger using it. And the case doesn&#x27;t close properly. The items inside are too bulky to close correctly. The case does stay shut though so its still functioning. Other than that the kit is great</li>
    <li> Stainless steel is a must to avoid infection. Keep the tools clean with alcohol pads.</li>
    <li> Wonderful set, everything you need and it&#x27;s packaged beautifully.</li>
    <li> you are the best I love YOU</li>
    <li> Not the usual tools you find, but I have found this kit to be very useful for difficult toenails, not everything you need though.</li>
    <li> The clippers are not sharp at all.</li>
    <li> The tools seem to be of good quality, but the latch on the case doesn&#x27;t really hold it shut very well.</li>
    <li> Nice package. It looks well made, but two of the trims broke at the first use.</li>
    <li> bought for a friend who said she love it. Nice buy.</li>
    <li> This manicure set is basically unusable. The metal is not sanded down, so it has super sharp edges on every tool. They aren&#x27;t polished, so the raw steel feels horrible to even hold. You&#x27;re better off buying a kit for a few more dollars somewhere else. Would definitely not buy again.</li>
    <li> Convenient.  Arrived quickly per usual.  Decent quality for scissors and other pieces. However, the clippers broke during the first week I used them (read: 2nd time of light use).  Not too sturdy</li>
    <li> works well to keep you well manicured.</li>
    <li> It arrived a bit late but worth the wait...</li>
    <li> This was a stocking stuffer for my daughter for Christmas.  She bought me one too!  We both love them.  So many tools, the clippers are great, even if you have thick toe nails.  They are all pretty sharp, so be careful when you use some the tools.  I would recommend this.  It&#x27;s great!!</li>
    <li> Excellent item.  I used to give to the gentlemen in my church for father&#x27;s day and they all loved the gift.  Good quality instruments, fancy case, awesome!</li>
    <li> Very Nice, well worth the money</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re rather stiff and I&#x27;m scared to use the cuticle clippers. Primarily wanted something for my desk at work for emergency touch-ups.</li>
    <li> Instruments are not sharp. The nail clippers don&#x27;t even cut the nail all the way through.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quite flimsy, the best thing about this is the case. It&#x27;s a decent faux leather clip case. The tools are all cheaply made. It&#x27;s to be expected at this price point. It does get the job done albeit crudely.</li>
    <li> The ear cleaner is used the most, but wish it was more rounded, rather than flat.  Otherwise, good kit</li>
    <li> nice set, not the best, but it has a bunch of stuff.</li>
    <li> Really high quality pieces, most of the stuff I do not even know how to use. Perfect stocking stuffer as a travel kit for women as well as men.</li>
    <li> Its an okay set. I used the Fingernail clipper once and it broke. But you pay for what you get.</li>
    <li> First time getting a set like this. Last one I had didn&#x27;t come with near enough, broke or just overall didn&#x27;t work that it was useless. The fact that I got this was because it seemed strong enough to actually work with. (Nails tend to be stronger then the average, and so on) which makes it easier because of the metal they are made out of. It came with ALL pieces, and not at all any problems. The best thing about this is that it is little enough to carry around with you, without taking to much room. It is very handy specially when you need it and you aren&#x27;t home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something that I would recommend anyone to get if they are looking for a certain time of kit. It is a great value for the price, compared to the ones that you get anywhere and are basically the same. The colors of the case are actually very fitting as well, they are not any tears in the fabric or so on. Each part itself works wonderful, and gets the job done that your trying to do. Size is perfect for any that need something not to big, but not to small. Makes a great gift as well if your looking for surprising someone.</li>
    <li> this is far better than expected! read all the reviews and thought it might be chintzy.....not at all! the items are on the small side; however , they are of very good quality and the case is solid too. would recommend!!!!</li>
    <li> LISTEN AS LONG AS ITS MADE IN CHINA CHEAP,WE GET CHEAP MATERIALS .THIS IS OK AND LOTS TOOLS FOR THIS PRICE.&lt;br /&gt;IT DOES THE JOB WELL,SO BECAUSE PRICE,I WILL SAY 4 STARS</li>
    <li> Had been looking for a set like this for a while, but didn&#x27;t want to spend fifty dollars for one. This set is well made and extremely sharp, one has to be very careful when using for the first time. All the tools you will ever need are included the finish seems to be stainless steel. The case is good, but you have to be careful and return all items to their spot or the case won&#x27;t close. So good I purchased two for our sons. Unbelievable manicure set at this price, looks like it will last forever.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband so he&#x27;d stay out of mine. He&#x27;s happy with it !</li>
    <li> These are the best I ever used like them very much</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. It&#x27;s small,  but had all the tools you need for a good mani and pedi. The tools&#x27; material quality is also very good.</li>
    <li> This was a gift to a love one. so far no responds. so no news is good news. also it looks very nice like the picture and it came fast.</li>
    <li> This has never happened to me with Amazon before. The kit arrived incomplete! Only included 8 items instead of 10.  I should have known based on the price, but have always been so pleased with Amazon.  Didn&#x27;t think they would sell items not as described.  So disappointed -returned immediately.</li>
    <li> Item delivered promptly and as described.</li>
    <li> I just needed some nail clippers, and this was cheaper than most and came with so much more. Good value and everything works great.</li>
    <li> Instruments are of poor quality, case is very nice.</li>
    <li> The finger nail clippers don&#x27;t work. The other tools are ok.</li>
    <li> very inexpensive and a great tool</li>
    <li> Great Item in General. From A to Z. A Must To Buy For Travelers. Thanks.</li>
    <li> As cheap as its price.  Enough said.</li>
    <li> Cheap and everything is very high quality</li>
    <li> Good manicure set for the price, lots of pieces and the quality of Rach piece is good. Very pleased with the set</li>
    <li> Im a guy, all I really needed was a pair of nail clippers. I figured, what the hell, it cant hurt to have all this extra stuff for around the same price. I still havnt used half of the set, but the things I do use work great!</li>
    <li> it is really nice and handy and the price is reasonble</li>
    <li> I ordered this set to put in our 5th wheel camper so we&#x27;d always have a clipper when a broken nail catches us off guard away from home.  I was delighted at the quality of the case and the contents.  I&#x27;ve decided to keep this one home and put my old set in the  camper.  As hubby said, &amp;#34;I&#x27;d forgotten what a sharp clipper was like.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much better set than expected for the cost.</li>
    <li> Very thin and great for travel. Has everything you might need in it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a gift hope she likes it.</li>
    <li> I needed a inexpensive travel kit that includes nail clippers and this one meets all of my expectations.</li>
    <li> the holder sucks and rips fast but the items inside are worth it</li>
    <li> Large nail clipper does not work. It peels nail off. Other clippers are sharp. These stanless product are not well polished.&lt;br /&gt;This set was shipped from China. It takes too long to arrive.</li>
    <li> I bought this set because it had some good reviews. Was disappointed. They are not comfortable to hold or use. This is probably an item best picked in the store... Where you can see it in 3D. The case is better than the stuff inside. I will probably keep it and fill it with items I buy in the store.</li>
    <li> Fast and just as described.</li>
    <li> Really bad quality in everything!!!</li>
    <li> Great, all items are functional and it arrives sooner than predicted. Which was a surprise. Its handy to have all the items in a case.</li>
    <li> Very well put together, I obviously trust my hands and feet with it. Can&#x27;t beat it it for the price.</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time, as shown, and undamaged.&lt;br /&gt;I needed new clippers and a nail file and for the price the whole kit seemed worth it. The tools are made okay, but not great. They get the job done. I wouldn&#x27;t open a nail salon with these but for the occasional self or family nail care it is fine. Case is quite nice and even looks like the Gmail icon when closed!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent  grooming kit</li>
    <li> The cuticle scissors arrived broken and the nail clippers are so dull they won&#x27;t cut my nails at all. This set is absolute junk. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Nice set for the money. Made in China but comes with nice case and very sharp instruments. Has pretty much everything you need when travelling or just keeping handy. No more searching for those clippers that magically disappeared after the crowd leaves. You cant beat the price for a complete kit. Not what I would use professionally, but perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> The product is ok because the price. But overall, was not real happy with it.</li>
    <li> Is nice but when you first puck them up they seam like a cheap metal, they cut well, but tend to make a very fine strong cut so it makes your nail really sharp. Even if it is rounded.</li>
    <li> When the same price could only buy you a small scissor elsewhere, what could you complain on this well-functional set?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This set is absolutely fantastic value! It has everything you might need for personal grooming nails, and then some.</li>
    <li> It works fine except I don&#x27;t think the tools are as sharp as I expected.  Some don&#x27;t really seem to clip except on thin nails and that is not what I expectedl</li>
    <li> Case is not red, but a dark pink.</li>
    <li> This was very inexpensive so i was a little worried that it would be junk. Considering what I paid I wasn&#x27;t expecting great quality. I was pleasantly surprised by the tools being decent quality. I really just wanted the nail clippers and tweezers bit the other tools can come in handy too, just depends what you are looking for!  That&#x27;s why I like having this kit on hand!</li>
    <li> It has a bunch of tools that work perfectly. The clippers are sharp and they fit pretty good in the case.</li>
    <li> Extremely cheap feeling. The stainless steel makes the products extremely light-weight, flimsy and not very capable-feeling. I like my grooming pieces with a nice weight to them, these do not have that at all. Tweezers do not pick and instead they cut, how do I pluck hair if it gets cut instead? Scissors are also bent at the tips so I have to hold them at a slight angle. The case does not close easily and needs to be squeezed hard to close it. Even when it is closed, it stresses the case a lot because of this. Do not get this.</li>
    <li> Case needs work and change the color to basic black.</li>
    <li> Good. Decent. Does the job. Cheapest possible metal and construction. But, again, does it&#x27;s job, and is what you&#x27;d expect for the price.</li>
    <li> Tools feel cheap, rough edges</li>
    <li> Case is cheap and won&#x27;t close, also tweezers aren&#x27;t great.</li>
    <li> I have used this tool to do a lot of things that you can&#x27;t possibly imagine. Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> The clippers aren&#x27;t sharp. They feel uncomfortable against your nail once you clip them. It&#x27;s hard to describe but they don&#x27;t have that traditional crisp clip making it harder to clip your nails. Also the tip of the larger salon-like cuticle clippers have an odd slant that make it difficult to cut your own cuticles with your other hand.</li>
    <li> This is a great kit, especially for the price.  I&#x27;ve been using it weekly for 3 months and love the look, feel and precision of the tools that I&#x27;ve used (which is 2/3 of them).  I anticipate that this product set will last me for many years to come and appreciate that it comes with a storage case. My only suggestion is that that the manufacturer provide a quick overview guide for each product.  ..nothing overly elaborate but a simple black and white manual with some graphics and utilization summaries would be very helpful.</li>
    <li> great set to take care of your nails</li>
    <li> Love it&#x27;s like a surgical kit for your nails!!!!</li>
    <li> case locks shut.&lt;br /&gt;tools are much better quality than I expected for the price!</li>
    <li> Great quality! The price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Poor material (tools). Doesn&#x27;t work very well (tools). Just fairly get the job done. Not for heavy duty at all!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> All items in this kit are good quality with two exceptions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail file is acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers are awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case fits into my purse easily. The cuticle tools work well, and I say this as a woman who has never held most of the tools in this kit before this purchase. I was expecting the toenail clippers to be a larger form of fingernail clippers, except flat, like toenail clippers I&#x27;ve used in the past have been, but I find I like the one in this kit better. It doesn&#x27;t seem to mangle the corners of my big toenails as badly as the other has done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this but purchase separate nail files and tweezers.</li>
    <li> The outer and inside stitching could have been done better but every other item works</li>
    <li> i bought this for my teen daughter who loves to do her nails, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the tools, given the great low price.</li>
    <li> I really like this set.  The one draw back is my clippers are a little less steel like in feeling.  They clip, but it seems to take more effort than my old set. Still would buy again.</li>
    <li> Really great product, I would higly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This set works great and is perfect for travel. It come with more than enough to keep both hands and feet trimmed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s got everything you need on the go. Great little kit.</li>
    <li> A nice complete set for trims nails and pulling skin off wounds.  So, nice bought another for my tool box.</li>
    <li> The case/kid has everything for nail care  and I wish we had had the opportunity to purchase long, long.long ago!</li>
    <li> The items within are very weak and flimsy. The tweezers are absolute crap but the nail cutters work great. It might be worth the extra $$$ to get a better quality item. Wish I did...</li>
    <li> Bought this for my spouse. He now spends 1-2 hours a day taking care of his fingernails. I miss him.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t rate this item higher than 2 stars. Even though it comes in nice box and has plenty of different items.  I want nice little scissors for cutting nails. Scissors are bad, never get sharpened in first place I guess. Useless. Will try to find another one.</li>
    <li> Nicer than I thought it would be for such a cheap price! Finally, I don&#x27;t have to go hunting for where the nail trimmers are or where the little scissors are! Why didn&#x27;t I do this 15 years ago? Just buy it.  UPDATE--The case fell apart after a year of use, which makes this formally 5-star review only 2 stars. The tools all still work, but what I really wanted was for them to be in a nice case!</li>
    <li> Handy to keep hid away in drawer, all  in one place and there when needed.</li>
    <li> Box is very low quality. It does not close properly. 1 of the tool holder is torn.</li>
    <li> Best set for the price. Everything&#x27;s good except the large clipper sometimes don&#x27;t open all the way.</li>
    <li> A lot of things for little money.</li>
    <li> The nail file is small, otherwise this was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> It is not a good steelers</li>
    <li> Really nice little kit.  Everything is sharp and works like a charm.  Definitely taking this on my travels.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband at Christmas time. It is much, much nicer than I was expecting. It&#x27;s very useful, well-made, and convenient, both the case and everything in it. It&#x27;s two months later and he&#x27;s still happy with it. I imagine he&#x27;ll be using it for a very long time. I&#x27;ll be getting one for myself. It arrived promptly, shipped in an oversized enveloped from a company in Kentucky, I think. (Another reviewer mentioned theirs came in an old red and gold Chinese box, I wish mine did because I like stuff like that, but, oh, well.)</li>
    <li> The case is bulky and weighs more than you would expect. The tools themselves are poor quality. I&#x27;m generally not impressed.</li>
    <li> Great for my suitcase. You never know what you&#x27;ll need while traveling. Mediocre quality, but what would you expect at this price? The case looks like the GMail logo, which is kind of annoying, but shouldn&#x27;t deter you from buying.</li>
    <li> the case is really cool, the price is even cooler. havent used all the untensils cause i dont need too, just the clippers.</li>
    <li> Im Disappointed!!&lt;br /&gt;Is bad Product</li>
