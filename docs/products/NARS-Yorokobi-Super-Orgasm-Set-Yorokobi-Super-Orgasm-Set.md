      <li>Quality product and a great price.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You should try again -- NARS products are amazing!</li>
      <li>But, to each their own!</li>
      <li>The lip gloss is beautiful, the gloss is sooo pretty, and of course the blush is AMAZING!!!  </li>
      <li>that&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
      <li>Not too bright and leaves a lovely color that lasts.</li>
      <li>or I have some kind of function to go.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many alternatives in cheaper brands but none compare with this.  </li>
      <li>Which was okay.</li>
      <li>Orgasm is way better.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a fun gift or good if you want to try out the colors.</li>
      <li>now I want to try more from NARS products</li>
      <li>I love this Nars color.  </li>
      <li>But I love the blush and the lip gloss.</li>
      <li>I do love the blush.  </li>
      <li>Its perfect for throwing in you tiny makeup bag for your purse.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love all of their products.</li>
      <li>mini blush(which can also be used on the eyes)&lt;br /&gt;&amp; the nail polish- all fabulous!</li>
      <li>, it is one of the most beautiful colors I have ever seen as far as blush goes.  </li>
      <li>The nail polish is pretty &amp; provides an attractive golden sparkle.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I got this so cheap because I have been DYING to try super orgasm blush.  </li>
      <li>Very pretty colors!</li>
      <li>The blush glitter flecks were huge.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed the colors very much.  </li>
      <li>its so pretty and has more glitter than i thought it would have,</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe they charge $28 for the full size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>would defiantly get this again or the full size one&#x27;s know that iv tried them.</li>
      <li>mini sizes only good use is to try the product as &#x27;samples&#x27;.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very bright, true pink (on me anyway) &amp; the sparkles are very sparse &amp; not blended.</li>
      <li>I have never seen a polish chip so quickly, by day 3</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s what you get with super orgasm.</li>
      <li>Huge drawback: it chips the first day.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a great little set.</li>
      <li>and my daughter started to laugh .This</li>
      <li>I think the reduced price was definatley worth it</li>
      <li>and I have spent good money on drugstore nail polish that did not work.  </li>
      <li>Glad to try them out in smaller sizes before splurging on full size prices.</li>
      <li>Otherwise I recommend MAC for higher quality, long-lasting products at a far better price.</li>
      <li>I will certainly be buying the full size version when I run out of this</li>
      <li>Very reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>this is my first NARS purchase.</li>
      <li>;)  </li>
      <li>I should have read the reviews but first time buyer.</li>
      <li>My first reaction was \\&quot;</li>
      <li>Lastly, NARS products are not only comparable to MAC, they&#x27;re actually considered more high-end and better quality than MAC in many ways.  </li>
      <li>It tastes like pure petroleum &amp; very chemical.</li>
      <li>I knew this item was a &amp;#34;sampler&amp;#34; but I expected more quality because of the &amp;#34;Nars&amp;#34; labeling.</li>
      <li>The nail polish wasn&#x27;t really my thing, as it was very shimmery and sparkly, my mom will get a kick out of it.</li>
      <li>The blush was ok not much pigmentation to it.</li>
      <li>SO ReALLY</li>
      <li>First, this color of blush is the \\&quot;super orgasm\\&quot; -- not the \\&quot;universally flattering\\&quot; cult-fave \\&quot;orgasm.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>From all the raves about this particular color</li>
      <li>I expected something really fantastic, but it didn&#x27;t really measure up to the MAC blush I normally use.</li>
      <li>This is a seriously high quality product.  </li>
      <li>highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>The packaging was so flimsy, when it came in it had scratches on the little cute box</li>
      <li>With the shipping I paid a total of 30$... wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
      <li>Its a nice set, but still the makeup is very small</li>
      <li>But i cant give that dont look new.</li>
      <li>Sometimes it really is just worth the splurge, it lasts forever and its cheaper than trying ten different ones that you will never wear.  </li>
      <li>The nail polish is a pretty color but very sheer.</li>
      <li>, I thought it was just the regular Orgasm color, it was only until AFTER I ordered it that I realized it was Super Orgasm.</li>
      <li>color is super orgasm &amp; it is much prettier than the plain orgasm color.&lt;br</li>
      <li>These products will last me longer than most people because I do not wear the same colors on a daily basis, and I only wear make out when I&#x27;m out with friends</li>
      <li>It looks like a completely natural flush.  </li>
      <li>Nail polish must be old because it was no time at all before it chipped.</li>
      <li>but it was old</li>
      <li>I gave it 4 stars due to the funky odor of the gloss, but other than that the blush is the perfect shade for my olive complexion, gloss isn&#x27;t the heavy, sticky feeling I hate, it&#x27;s lightweight and the perfect shade of pink.</li>
      <li>The color offered here, Super Orgasm, is different from Orgasm in that it contains big chunks of glitter, thus applies differently.  </li>
      <li>Yes these are small items, yes the super orgasm blush has noticeable gold flecks as well as the nail polish, but the pigments are high quality including the lipgloss.  </li>
      <li>I was not expecting all three items to have such high amount of gold glitter in it.</li>
      <li>And it is soooo CUTE in its tiny tiny little packaging!  </li>
      <li>I have spent so much money on drugstore products.  </li>
      <li>Secondly, it is a sampler set, so products are much smaller than normal size -- and this was a collection that came out quite some time ago, which may exlain the \\&quot;gloopiness\\</li>
      <li>Common ladies, your worth it!  </li>
      <li>Some colors I can do without, while other colors I can&#x27;t live without!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Looks like you&#x27;re getting a deal in the picture.Wait till you actually get it in your hand .Tiny little powder kit with nail polish and lipstick. My first reaction was \\&quot; What the hell\\&quot; .Me and my daughter started to laugh .This is a \\&quot;SAMPLE SET\\&quot;.What a deal .</li>
    <li> I enjoyed the colors very much.  The lipgloss stays for hours.  The nail polish chipped the day after I put it on.  I do love the blush.  Not too bright and leaves a lovely color that lasts.</li>
    <li> the colors are all wrong and the glittery products are nearly impossible to remove. especially the nail polish. it takes forever to dry and the color sucks.</li>
    <li> i was happy to get this makeup but it was old the blush had cracks in it. its was going to be as a birthday presant. But i cant give that dont look new. SO ReALLY DisPPionted! I should have read the reviews but first time buyer. So i would now.</li>
    <li> I got this for my sister and she loves it. Especially the blush it was a great purchase definetly recommend.</li>
    <li> The sizes are extremely small. Very disappointed.  The polish was thick and seemed old.  The blush glitter flecks were huge. Not a fan! Orgasm is way better. I would not recommend!</li>
    <li> Its a nice set, but still the makeup is very small</li>
    <li> I gave it 4 stars due to the funky odor of the gloss, but other than that the blush is the perfect shade for my olive complexion, gloss isn&#x27;t the heavy, sticky feeling I hate, it&#x27;s lightweight and the perfect shade of pink. The nail polish is a little hard to apply with the tiny wand. All in all it&#x27;s a great little set. This set would make a great stocking stuffer for your makeup lover!</li>
    <li> I was not expecting all three items to have such high amount of gold glitter in it. Lip gloss smelled stale. Product size is mini almost like sample version. Very disappointed with the product.</li>
    <li> I have spent so much money on drugstore products.  I have purchased revlon blush and have spent over 10 dollars and have had to triple dip my brush to get pigment on the tip.  I have spent alot of money on drugstore lipstick that was super expensive and the lipstick has dried/cracked my lips and I have spent good money on drugstore nail polish that did not work.  Yes these are small items, yes the super orgasm blush has noticeable gold flecks as well as the nail polish, but the pigments are high quality including the lipgloss.  I think the reduced price was definatley worth it and it is hard to find these colors.</li>
    <li> You actually get a lot of product!  I am so glad I got this so cheap because I have been DYING to try super orgasm blush.  The lip gloss is beautiful, the gloss is sooo pretty, and of course the blush is AMAZING!!!  And it is soooo CUTE in its tiny tiny little packaging!  Its perfect for throwing in you tiny makeup bag for your purse.  It has a little mirror and everything.  I have had it for months now and use it quite a bit and still have a ton left.  I will certainly be buying the full size version when I run out of this, it is one of the most beautiful colors I have ever seen as far as blush goes.  There are gold sparkles in it but they flatter rather than overpower.  It looks like a completely natural flush.  I cannot praise it enough.  This is a seriously high quality product.  I have tried so many alternatives in cheaper brands but none compare with this.  None.  Sometimes it really is just worth the splurge, it lasts forever and its cheaper than trying ten different ones that you will never wear.  Common ladies, your worth it!  xo</li>
    <li> While the blush is highly pigmented &amp; appears to be of quality ingredients it is hardly the \\&quot;universally flattering peach\\&quot; described. From all the raves about this particular color I expected something really fantastic, but it didn&#x27;t really measure up to the MAC blush I normally use. It&#x27;s a very bright, true pink (on me anyway) &amp; the sparkles are very sparse &amp; not blended. You end up with individual bits of glitter standing out on your cheekbones. On the whole I&#x27;m not impressed. I can&#x27;t believe they charge $28 for the full size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gloss is good texture with a soft peach sheen &amp; is quite long lasting, the flavor is terrible though! It tastes like pure petroleum &amp; very chemical. Unpleasant. The nail polish is pretty &amp; provides an attractive golden sparkle. Huge drawback: it chips the first day. Mine actually chipped overnight while I was asleep! I have never seen a polish chip so quickly, by day 3 it was half gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fun gift or good if you want to try out the colors. Otherwise I recommend MAC for higher quality, long-lasting products at a far better price.</li>
    <li> this is my first NARS purchase. I like the color its so pretty and has more glitter than i thought it would have, but I am happy with the purchase now I want to try more from NARS products</li>
    <li> The package got here super fast,but I was very disappointed in the size of the blush it&#x27;s only about an inch big &amp; the lip gloss smells &amp; tastes terrible, to the point where it is un-wearable. The nail polish is a pretty color but very sheer. With the shipping I paid a total of 30$... wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
    <li> I am a Nars fanatic! I absolutely love all of their products. Some colors I can do without, while other colors I can&#x27;t live without! I actually made one mistake when ordering this, I thought it was just the regular Orgasm color, it was only until AFTER I ordered it that I realized it was Super Orgasm. Which was okay. I&#x27;m still very happy with the purchase. The nail polish wasn&#x27;t really my thing, as it was very shimmery and sparkly, my mom will get a kick out of it. I won&#x27;t be using it. But I love the blush and the lip gloss. I will be using them until they&#x27;re gone. For $17.48 (with shipping) that&#x27;s a good deal. In stores you would be paying double that for the set, especially since they sell the Mini Lip Gloss in stores for around 10 dollars. These products will last me longer than most people because I do not wear the same colors on a daily basis, and I only wear make out when I&#x27;m out with friends or I have some kind of function to go. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Nars! Especially buying from Amazon! Quality product and a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for all those people who were saying that the products are small, they&#x27;re MINI&#x27;s. The product description even says that you receive a MINI blush, MINI nail polish and MINI lip gloss. They&#x27;re not full sized products. They&#x27;re MINI&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I knew this item was a &amp;#34;sampler&amp;#34; but I expected more quality because of the &amp;#34;Nars&amp;#34; labeling. The lipgloss was a bloob of sticky mess, not blend-able at all. The nail-polish was clumpy. The blush was ok not much pigmentation to it. The packaging was so flimsy, when it came in it had scratches on the little cute box everything comes in as well as dents which isnt that big of a problem but just adds to the disappointment. Probably will never buy another Nars item whoomp whoomp</li>
    <li> For the reviewers unhappy with the product (size, glitter, etc.), it may be helpful to do a bit of research within the NARS product line before purchasing from a site like Amazon.  First, this color of blush is the \\&quot;super orgasm\\&quot; -- not the \\&quot;universally flattering\\&quot; cult-fave \\&quot;orgasm.\\&quot;  The color offered here, Super Orgasm, is different from Orgasm in that it contains big chunks of glitter, thus applies differently.  Secondly, it is a sampler set, so products are much smaller than normal size -- and this was a collection that came out quite some time ago, which may exlain the \\&quot;gloopiness\\&quot; of the gloss and polish.  Lastly, NARS products are not only comparable to MAC, they&#x27;re actually considered more high-end and better quality than MAC in many ways.  But, to each their own! ;)  Unfortunately, it sounds as if you may have just gotten a bad batch and/or selected the wrong color/product for you!  You should try again -- NARS products are amazing!</li>
    <li> Nail polish must be old because it was no time at all before it chipped. Very pretty colors! Glad to try them out in smaller sizes before splurging on full size prices. Lip gloss has a bit of an odd smell and of course there&#x27;s chunky glitter that some may not like,  but that&#x27;s what you get with super orgasm.</li>
    <li> Luv this product! Very reasonably priced. No one else has anything like it.&lt;br /&gt;The color is super orgasm &amp; it is much prettier than the plain orgasm color.&lt;br /&gt;It has some shimmer &amp; have used the lip gloss, mini blush(which can also be used on the eyes)&lt;br /&gt;&amp; the nail polish- all fabulous! I got one for me &amp; another as a gift for my sister.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this Nars color.  It works well with everything.  My only complaint is the the blush is the size of an eveshadow.</li>
    <li> would defiantly get this again or the full size one&#x27;s know that iv tried them. I like to get to set to see if I like the colors.</li>
    <li> The blush is supper small, the nail ploish is watery and the lip gloss is very sticky. ALL the products are mini sizes only good use is to try the product as &#x27;samples&#x27;. Not worth the money.</li>
