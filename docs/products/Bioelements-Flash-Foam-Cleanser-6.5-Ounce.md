      <li>And it arrived super quick!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t make my face feel clean</li>
      <li>Other than that, it works great.</li>
      <li>Texture is good but not for anyone I dry climates.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and love to wash my face with this.  </li>
      <li>Alot of other cleansers I have dont do that good of a job cleaning makeup off but the bioelement does.</li>
      <li>I noticed if you wet your face first, it doesn&#x27;t seem to clean as well and kind of washes away.</li>
      <li>Also it breaks down the makeup really good.</li>
      <li>, I use make-up remover first then wash my face).  </li>
      <li>Love this product and entire product line.</li>
      <li>Shipped and received fast!</li>
      <li>been using it for a few years, good stuff</li>
      <li>Good all round cleanser</li>
      <li>Originally I started out with the cleanser for sensitive skin, which I have, but then switched to the foam cleanser because I wanted to try it</li>
      <li>Again great price, have used for several years and skin pores are minimal</li>
      <li>I really like the feel of my face after cleansing with Flash Foam.</li>
      <li>Just be sure to not have your face dripping wet otherwise</li>
      <li>This is the real Bioelements Flash Foam too, not some knock-off product.</li>
      <li>Really like using this face wash.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>that cleans my face so well so fast.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin</li>
      <li>It worked very well.</li>
      <li>I like it as much as I remembered that I did.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t use much make-up, just some BB cream and this cleanser</li>
      <li>I like things to lather up which this product really doesn&#x27;t do</li>
      <li>It is not harsh at all and your face feels smooth and soft after using it.  </li>
      <li>but this is my favorite go to cleanser over the other.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>And I seem to need 2-3 times as much foam than I do in the AM when I&#x27;m only cleansing gently to remove any night cream residue.</li>
      <li>After you wash your face it is very soft.</li>
      <li>And, the regular sized products do last so the cost is worth it!</li>
      <li>My husband and I both use this cleanser and are so glad to find it on Amazon-for LESS than we pay at the local salon.  </li>
      <li>So far, i havent had any allergies or redness so am still using it.</li>
      <li>Its a soft moose like product.</li>
      <li>This cleanser is a little better than using just plain water</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like the feel of my face after cleansing with Flash Foam. I just wish they made smaller containers for travel; however, I took it with me anyway because I didn&#x27;t want to go a day without using it.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and this cleanser seems to control oil and breakouts better than others I have tried. I previously tried dermalogica clay cleanser, bioelements spotless cleanser and another bioelements cleanser I think it was some clarifying cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using this foam cleanser I put one pump on my face dry then wet my fingers and rub it in.  I noticed if you wet your face first, it doesn&#x27;t seem to clean as well and kind of washes away. For a bonus, it smells really good, kind of like citrus.</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m anti-foam...or spoiled by other products I&#x27;ve used in the past, but I just don&#x27;t feel like my face is cleansed of the day&#x27;s make-up while being soothed and refreshed when I use it at night. And I seem to need 2-3 times as much foam than I do in the AM when I&#x27;m only cleansing gently to remove any night cream residue. It do like the extra gentleness and silky feel in the AM so I&#x27;ll continue to use it - but only for mornings. I&#x27;ll find something else for the evening cleanse.</li>
    <li> Has improved my skin drastically. I use this and the moisturizer. I had a facial recently and she told me how great my skin is.</li>
    <li> Nice cleanser, I wasn&#x27;t so sure about a foam cleanser but I do like this one.  Seems to make my skin feel very smooth.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  And it arrived super quick!</li>
    <li> I have been using Bioelements Flash Foam for about a year and I am happy with the results.  One bottle lasts me 4 1/2 months (I always put the date I started using it on my stuff so I know how long it lasts).  You really only need 1 pump (sometimes I do 2 just to get extra cleanser) and I do wash my face twice a day (at night, I use make-up remover first then wash my face).  I haven&#x27;t had as much problems with my oily skin as I&#x27;ve had in the past, I now go through one oil absorbent sheet, sometimes two, in a a day versus the six and seven sheets I used to use. And, it&#x27;s been ages since I&#x27;ve had any break-outs as well. Originally I started out with the cleanser for sensitive skin, which I have, but then switched to the foam cleanser because I wanted to try it and I&#x27;ve had no sensitivity issues with it.  I just wish that Bioelements had a make-up line, I think they could come up with something good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think all the products are good by Bioelements.  It&#x27;s best to start with the travel sizes if you&#x27;re unsure what cleanser, toner, and moisturizer you need - beauty products are really trial and error.  And, the regular sized products do last so the cost is worth it!</li>
    <li> The product came packaged with grass and seeds inside the product box. I am not sure what the stuff was, but II&#x27;m positive it shouldn&#x27;t have been there.  Extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and love to wash my face with this.  It is not harsh at all and your face feels smooth and soft after using it.  It was recommend a girl at a salon I went to.  Love it!  The bottle lasts me about 6 months.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> This cleanser is great for oily skin.  I have combo. skin and it doesn&#x27;t dry it out like some cleansers do.  After using it my face feels really clean and the scent is pleasant.  Just be sure to not have your face dripping wet otherwise the product tends to slide off and you&#x27;d need to use more.  Also, careful around the eyes- it stings!  I guess you could use eye makeup remover but I like to take a minimalist approach to my skincare regimen.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great and its the Only cleanser that doesn&#x27;t make me break out, I&#x27;ve been using it for a year or so.</li>
    <li> Really like using this face wash.  Great for the skin, easy to use and makes my skin look great.</li>
    <li> I have to be incredibly careful about what I put on my skin as I can break out easily with the wrong products. I have been using this same cleanser for years and I absolutely love it. I just don&#x27;t like how there is a specific amount that comes out every single time with this pump - sometimes I just need a dab for eye makeup removal. Other than that, it works great. I have and will continue to recommend it.</li>
    <li> been using it for a few years, good stuff</li>
    <li> The product is great. I was a bit skeptical at first because it was foam. After you wash your face it is very soft. Also it breaks down the makeup really good. Alot of other cleansers I have dont do that good of a job cleaning makeup off but the bioelement does. I love this product.</li>
    <li> Good all round cleanser</li>
    <li> My wife has been buying this exact same product at the salon for many years and the markup is outrageous. Great professional skin care product. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This feel awesome on your skin. It is not greasy or overly drying. Its a soft moose like product.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my daughter, she&#x27;s loving it.&lt;br /&gt;Her face looks wonderful, its bright, clear and not all dried out...</li>
    <li> Great product - my husband likes it too!  I&#x27;ve been using for several years now and it works great at removing makeup.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for my skin which is dray in some area and oily in others! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I used this product for washing my face more than three years. It worked very well. I used one bottle for almost a year.</li>
    <li> After washing my face with this, if I wipe my face with toner, I see all of my make-up on the cotton pad. I really don&#x27;t use much make-up, just some BB cream and this cleanser cannot even take that off. This cleanser is a little better than using just plain water but why spend the money for that?</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use this cleanser and are so glad to find it on Amazon-for LESS than we pay at the local salon.  It is a wonderful cleanser, gentle and effective!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a year now and I have noticed a significant difference in my skin&#x27;s tone, texture, clarity, and blemish control.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Great cleanser but be sure to order the travel size before going anywhere with it. The cap just will not keep the product in the bottle, even on a road trip where it just leans a bit to the side. Thankfully a smaller version is offered for sale. Don&#x27;t make this same mistake and lose a bottle of expensive face wash to your overnight bag!</li>
    <li> Should have realized how drying this would be but didn&#x27;t. Texture is good but not for anyone I dry climates.</li>
    <li> I personally prefer a foam cleanser. This product really cleans your face nicely without drying it out. It last a long time as well. I do use another cream base cleansers once in a while but this is my favorite go to cleanser over the other.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my face feel clean and when i use toner i still have residue and oiliness. not a good cleanser</li>
    <li> Truly a wonderful product.  I always notice a difference after using it.  I&#x27;ve tried almost all of the other Bioelements and I must say I&#x27;ve never had a problem with any of them.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t use this cleanser for a few years.  I like it as much as I remembered that I did.</li>
    <li> Love this product and entire product line. Flash foam is a great, gentle cleanser. Follow with bio elements equalizer and beyond hydration.</li>
    <li> I have never used a foam face cleanser before and its nice. I have used this product for about a month and I am still iffy on the foam... I like things to lather up which this product really doesn&#x27;t do but I feel like it still gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It feels like silk on your face and yet deep cleans your face.</li>
    <li> I have been a flash foam user for about 5 years. I have never found&lt;br /&gt;anything that cleans my face so well so fast. I love the prices I can&lt;br /&gt;find through Amazon.com!</li>
    <li> Shipped and received fast! This is the real Bioelements Flash Foam too, not some knock-off product. Bioelements cleansers are amazing!</li>
    <li> Keeps my face nice and clean</li>
    <li> The vendor is really good. Shipped the item on time. With regards to the product, am still using it. So far, i havent had any allergies or redness so am still using it. The only thing though is that it is a foam wash which when i press the dispenser it shoots out portion of it and of course this is a waste.&lt;br /&gt;Overall,  I am satisfied. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser.  It&#x27;s light and does a good job.  I even purchased the travel sized version!</li>
    <li> I love it, all in one face wash.</li>
    <li> Again great price, have used for several years and skin pores are minimal</li>
    <li> This face wash is great for sensitive skin. It cleans and leaves no residue. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t react to my skin leaving splotchy red spots.</li>
    <li> I love this product it gets the job done with no smells burning or anything else ! love it love it</li>
    <li> Great Item to cleanse your face</li>
