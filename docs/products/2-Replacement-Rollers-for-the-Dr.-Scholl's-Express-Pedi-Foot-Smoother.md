      <li>Great product at a good price!</li>
      <li>Received order on a timely manner and am happy with this product</li>
      <li>My feet were in better condition after one use of the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s than after spending two hours in a nail salon here and spending $100!  </li>
      <li>Very happy with the purchase and will definitely purchase again.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>This is a great product and  works very well.</li>
      <li>This is sooo much better than those scrapers they use at nail salons.</li>
      <li>Much better than the mani/pedi set I got years ago with a variety of attachments.  </li>
      <li>I purchased my Dr. Scholl&#x27;s foot smoother in another country, actually, and it is great!  </li>
      <li>I am so glad that I bought Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Express Pedi Foot Smoother.  </li>
      <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
      <li>She was so excited that she said I didn&#x27;t have to buy her a birthday or Christmas gift</li>
      <li>This does a great job on rough heels</li>

      <li>only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that there are other products on the market that are equally effective - Amope Pedi Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I purchased one with 3 coupons that brought the price down significantly.  </li>
      <li>These rollover heads wear down too quickly.</li>

<li> The Dr. Scholl&#x27;s pedi smoother is a poor design that doesn&#x27;t reach tough areas.</li>
<li> and my daughter has really uncomfortable heel problems</li>

    <li> This is sooo much better than those scrapers they use at nail salons. You can control how much is buffed off. Using a good foot cream after is the best combo. Wish they had a variety of replacement heads though. Live it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and  works very well. I would recommend it to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> Received order on a timely manner and am happy with this product</li>

    <li> I am so glad that I bought Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Express Pedi Foot Smoother.  I purchased one with 3 coupons that brought the price down significantly.  It did such a nice job and my daughter has really uncomfortable heel problems so I gave it to her.  She was so excited that she said I didn&#x27;t have to buy her a birthday or Christmas gift this year.&lt;br /&gt;I then ordered a second one for myself with replacement pads.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that there are other products on the market that are equally effective - Amope Pedi Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I read in a magazine recently that some didn&#x27;t like it because it creates &amp;#34;a mess of skin dust.:&amp;#34; Get over it and put a towel under your foot then you just throw the towel in laundry hamper.</li>
    <li> These work excellent! Very happy with the purchase and will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great product at a good price!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s pedi smoother these belong too and hence have stopped using it. These rollover heads wear down too quickly. The Dr. Scholl&#x27;s pedi smoother is a poor design that doesn&#x27;t reach tough areas. Competitor products without the upper edge reach all areas of the foot.</li>
    <li> I purchased my Dr. Scholl&#x27;s foot smoother in another country, actually, and it is great!  Much better than the mani/pedi set I got years ago with a variety of attachments.  My feet were in better condition after one use of the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s than after spending two hours in a nail salon here and spending $100!  Have not yet used one of the replacement pads but will post review on those when I do.</li>
    <li> This does a great job on rough heels</li>
    <li> high quality. I strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the easiest thing I&#x27;ve found that really works. I love it.</li>
    <li> Suffer from eczema and it helps remove the damage.</li>
    <li> Easy to replace and works very well.</li>
