      <li>this is the best product on the market.</li>
      <li>and I have experienced no dental problems whatsoever since using the product.</li>
      <li>But it seems to be caused by the tooth soap, and I&#x27;m happy to get it out of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Be your own doctor!</li>
      <li>The soap is good in that is doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals in it.</li>
      <li>I have ordered this product before and liked it.  </li>
      <li>Although I prefer the liquid product, the shreds are certainly effective.</li>
      <li>It has the spearmint smell, but leaves an after taste like after you vomit, that kind of smell and taste.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used soap to brush my teeth for a while now and this product is by far the best \\&quot;soap\\&quot; that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>Spearmint is my favorite</li>
      <li>This stuff was highly praised as being a great product, well I beg to differ.</li>
      <li>I like it pretty good.  </li>
      <li>Since I was a kid, I&#x27;ve also had problems with my gums becoming inflamed.  </li>
      <li>No glycerin in this natural product, very important to have good teeths.</li>
      <li>I love this product which leaves your teeths clean as if you were getting out of dentist office.</li>
      <li>I find it does a fine job of cleaning my teeth</li>
      <li>Yes, this product is accurately named.  </li>
      <li>Now, no, you will not get this huge spearmint, peppermint, or whatever, burst of flavor.</li>
      <li>There were no replacements available.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend for healthy teeth and gums!</li>
      <li>and my teeths are always clean.  </li>
      <li>My teeth we squeaky clean and just felt cleaner all day.</li>
      <li>My teeth feel so clean after using this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s far and away better than toothpaste!</li>
      <li>Before using this product I had good oral hygiene: I brushed 2-3 times a day and flossed every evening.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product.  </li>
      <li>For now, I am very satisfied with this; 1)easy to brush the teeth, no effort needed 2)feel the same clean teeth when I wake up in the morning.   </li>
      <li>I could tell a difference the very first time I used it.  </li>
      <li>If you want to have clean teeth and wake up with clean teeth and keep your teeth than I highly recomend this product.</li>
      <li>Also, you get used to the taste pretty quickly and if you happen to use toothpaste once or twice after that, it tastes like pure sugar!  </li>
      <li>But honestly I thought it was pretty gross the first three times, and then I just got used to it like anything else.</li>
      <li>Wake up people and take charge of your own health because if you trust the Medical Industry or Dentistry your doomed....... A very satisified customer</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the cinnamon, which tastes quite lovely, and it has left my teeth and gums cleaner than ever before... cleaner than even after a dental visit.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve recommended it to several people who all love it, too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too much!</li>
      <li>My husband didn&#x27;t want to use after the first trial.</li>
      <li>I gave this product a good try by using it for a few months.</li>
      <li>The people who clean my teeth are always amazed there is so little to do and how strong my teeth are.</li>
      <li>the flavor really, really bothers me.</li>
      <li>But I think they are really on to something.</li>
      <li>You must get ready for some soap flavor.</li>
      <li>My older sister would tease me that I had \\&quot;magnetic teeth\\&quot; because food particles were always sticking to my teeth.  </li>
      <li>Would Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I could easily have saved $20.00 &amp; just bit off a hunk of Irish Spring to brush my teeth &amp; gotten the same results.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive teeth and gave it a try.  </li>
      <li>Tooth Soap has really helped reduce the plaque on my teeth, eliminate the white coating on my tongue, and heal my gums.</li>
      <li>and before I was using a toothpaste for sensitive teeth.  </li>
      <li>I no longer have sensitive teeth when I brush</li>
      <li>Tried grinding it up into a powder and it solidified into a lump so added water and carefully poured a little on my toothbrush which worked much better.</li>
      <li>I read about Tooth Soap in Mimi Kirk&#x27;s Live Raw who said this stuff cured her sensitive teeth.  </li>

<li> My painful pockets are also a thing of the past thanks to this amazing product.</li>
<li> However, I was hoping they would turn a really light pink color, but (although they&#x27;re not bright red) they&#x27;re still dark pink.  </li>
<li> How long had that jar been sitting&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
<li> I&#x27;m interest in the &#x27;long tem effect.&#x27;</li>
<li> Prior to using tooth soap, my gums were often rather sore (though I never really had problems with bleeding...</li>
<li> And an obvious con is that it&#x27;s super expensive.  </li>
<li> The taste was not at all what I had expected, but with a name like &amp;#34;Tooth Soap&amp;#34; I should have.</li>
<li> The taste is very strange upon first few uses but after a few days i found that it is actually very pleasant especially when compared to regular paste which dries your mouth(very bad to have a dry mouth) and leaves an awful aftertaste(ever drank juice after brushing with paste?</li>
<li> To me, the soap flavor is minimal and not at all unpleasant and disappears quickly.</li>
<li> so if you want to line there pockets with your hard earned money than keep using the same products that you are using .</li>
<li> It&#x27;s really not worth it.</li>
<li> It is advertised as being spearmint flavored but it tastes just like your average bar of soap...</li>
<li> I had a tongue scraper that I would use after brushing my teeth, and a lot of gross yellowish tongue coating (ha, don&#x27;t know what else to call it) would scrape off every night (sorry to be gross).  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t mind the slight soap taste at all</li>
<li> My teeth turned yellow and I developed bad breath.</li>
<li> The taste stays in your mouth, it doesn&#x27;t wash away with a few rinses as advertised.</li>
<li> Palm oil production is destroying the rain forest and pushing the Sumatran and Bornean orangutans to extinction.</li>
<li> You get used to them after a few trials.</li>
<li> If it does (usually if I&#x27;ve eaten a lot of sugar that day)</li>
<li> Not pleased with it at all.</li>
<li> It was past the date.  </li>
<li> They should have this in a small pump/paste form.  </li>
<li> In the past month, my gums have not bothered me once.</li>
<li> Since using tooth soap, my tongue hardly ever gets a coating on it.</li>
<li> About three years ago i went to the dentist and was told i has three serious cavities that needed immediate work done.</li>
<li> The taste and the smell are not good.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed in the price though.</li>
<li> Another weird thing that happens some mornings after I&#x27;ve used this is I&#x27;ll cough up some phlegm.  </li>
<li> and she said everybody that is told that they have never had a cavatiy is wrong</li>
<li> I believe her teeth are fake.</li>
<li> and while I do still have cold sensitivity it no longer is uncomfortable to brush my teeth.  </li>
<li> I was also getting painful gaps between my gums and teeth.</li>
<li> Expensive and TERRIBLE!!!</li>
<li> Very unhappy about it.</li>
<li> it was disgusting!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been looking for an alternative to toothpaste because I want to keep the enamel on my teeth and this product has helped improve my gums and I really think it stops sugar from destroying your teeth as well.  My teeth feel cleaner and in the morning I don&#x27;t have that filmy feeling on them.  Also, you get used to the taste pretty quickly and if you happen to use toothpaste once or twice after that, it tastes like pure sugar!  It&#x27;s too much!</li>
    <li> I like it pretty good.  It&#x27;s not a bad product.  I&#x27;ve used soap to brush my teeth for a while now and this product is by far the best \\&quot;soap\\&quot; that I&#x27;ve used.  I don&#x27;t mind the slight soap taste at all and I do like the mint flavor.  I&#x27;m a little disappointed in the price though.</li>
    <li> I gave this product a good try by using it for a few months. Not pleased with it at all. My teeth turned yellow and I developed bad breath. I even purchased the tooth brightner and used it once a week, still it didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m back to using regular toothpaste and mouth wash.    Also, the founder of this product states that she uses it daily and her teeth sparkle on utube. I believe her teeth are fake.</li>
    <li> This stuff literally tastes like soap.  I cannot review its effectiveness because I cannot use it.  the flavor really, really bothers me.</li>
    <li> Tooth Soap is wonderful!! I&#x27;ve tried the cinnamon, which tastes quite lovely, and it has left my teeth and gums cleaner than ever before... cleaner than even after a dental visit. My gums and teeth have improved and everyone comments on how white my teeth are now. I&#x27;ve recommended it to several people who all love it, too. It&#x27;s far and away better than toothpaste!</li>
    <li> I read about Tooth Soap in Mimi Kirk&#x27;s Live Raw who said this stuff cured her sensitive teeth.  I have very sensitive teeth and gave it a try.  I could tell a difference the very first time I used it.  I no longer have sensitive teeth when I brush and before I was using a toothpaste for sensitive teeth.  Been using this for about 6 weeks and while I do still have cold sensitivity it no longer is uncomfortable to brush my teeth.  I&#x27;ll be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I have had problems with Dentistry just like the Medical industry I Don&#x27;t trust them... All they do is damage your teeth buy putting floride and chemical into toothpaste. It damages your teeth over time I saw a Dentist in my area and she said everybody that is told that they have never had a cavatiy is wrong she said everbody has cavaties she said that she could find a cavatiy in anyones mouth.... hows that for getting into your pockets I think Dentist are after your money so if you want to line there pockets with your hard earned money than keep using the same products that you are using . If you want to have clean teeth and wake up with clean teeth and keep your teeth than I highly recomend this product. If you have thining enamel this will allow the enamel to rebuild itself, Ask any Dentist and they will tell you its not possible for the enamel to do that.. I use the liquid form of this toothsoap and I think the Spearmint taste the best.... Wake up people and take charge of your own health because if you trust the Medical Industry or Dentistry your doomed....... A very satisified customer</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about one month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Tooth Soap has really helped reduce the plaque on my teeth, eliminate the white coating on my tongue, and heal my gums. Before using this product I had good oral hygiene: I brushed 2-3 times a day and flossed every evening. I used a tongue scraper at night, and often used some sort of mouth wash.  I also went to the dentist every 6 months to one year. However, I could not seem to keep the level of plaque on my teeth under control.  My older sister would tease me that I had \\&quot;magnetic teeth\\&quot; because food particles were always sticking to my teeth.  Tooth soap eliminated the plaque in my mouth.  I no longer have the problem of food sticking to my teeth.  I also always had a white tongue by the end of every day. I had a tongue scraper that I would use after brushing my teeth, and a lot of gross yellowish tongue coating (ha, don&#x27;t know what else to call it) would scrape off every night (sorry to be gross).  Since using tooth soap, my tongue hardly ever gets a coating on it. If it does (usually if I&#x27;ve eaten a lot of sugar that day), it comes off via brushing alone (i.e., I don&#x27;t have to use a tongue scraper to scrape it off after brushing).  Since I was a kid, I&#x27;ve also had problems with my gums becoming inflamed.  Prior to using tooth soap, my gums were often rather sore (though I never really had problems with bleeding...they would just get red and swollen).  In the past month, my gums have not bothered me once. However, I was hoping they would turn a really light pink color, but (although they&#x27;re not bright red) they&#x27;re still dark pink.  Another weird thing that happens some mornings after I&#x27;ve used this is I&#x27;ll cough up some phlegm.  I don&#x27;t know if the anti-bacterial quality draws it out of me or what. But it seems to be caused by the tooth soap, and I&#x27;m happy to get it out of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Yes, this product is accurately named.  It tastes soapy.  But honestly I thought it was pretty gross the first three times, and then I just got used to it like anything else. I don&#x27;t even notice it anymore. And it&#x27;s milder than a body or dish cleaning soap.  For all the benefits, I wouldn&#x27;t let that stop you. I also haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in the color of my teeth (meaning, they&#x27;re not getting whiter or anything). And an obvious con is that it&#x27;s super expensive.  But so are root canals and gingivitis.  The end.</li>
    <li> For now, I am very satisfied with this; 1)easy to brush the teeth, no effort needed 2)feel the same clean teeth when I wake up in the morning.   The taste and the smell are not good. My husband didn&#x27;t want to use after the first trial. I keep encouraging him. You get used to them after a few trials. I&#x27;m interest in the &#x27;long tem effect.&#x27; I&#x27;ll see if this item truly helps improving my oral health.</li>
    <li> About three years ago i went to the dentist and was told i has three serious cavities that needed immediate work done. I was also getting painful gaps between my gums and teeth. Around the same time i had found out about all the dangers of using and consuming sodium fluoride which was in all of the different tooth paste i was using. Two years later cavities have vanished without any fillings or any work done by my dentist. He can&#x27;t believe it. Be your own doctor! My painful pockets are also a thing of the past thanks to this amazing product. Don&#x27;t believe it? try it and see. The taste is very strange upon first few uses but after a few days i found that it is actually very pleasant especially when compared to regular paste which dries your mouth(very bad to have a dry mouth) and leaves an awful aftertaste(ever drank juice after brushing with paste? eewwwwww!). After 2-3 rinses the soap is gone and it leaves no flavor and does not stick teeth. Spearmint is my favorite but I&#x27;m going to give the ginger a try since I&#x27;ve already tried all the others. I will never switch from tooth soap! this is the best product on the market. I dare you to try!</li>
    <li> My teeth feel so clean after using this. Just like I came back from the dentists. Would Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This stuff was highly praised as being a great product, well I beg to differ. It is advertised as being spearmint flavored but it tastes just like your average bar of soap...it was disgusting! I could easily have saved $20.00 &amp; just bit off a hunk of Irish Spring to brush my teeth &amp; gotten the same results. The taste stays in your mouth, it doesn&#x27;t wash away with a few rinses as advertised. It felt like my Mom washed my mouth out with soap. Save your money...buy toothpaste!</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product before and liked it.  The jar I received tasted and smelled musty and then I checked&lt;br /&gt;the expiration date.  It was past the date.  There were no replacements available.  How long had that jar been sitting&lt;br /&gt;in your warehouse.  Very unhappy about it.</li>
    <li> I love this product which leaves your teeths clean as if you were getting out of dentist office. Result: I don&#x27;t go to the dentist office anymore and my teeths are always clean.  No glycerin in this natural product, very important to have good teeths.</li>
    <li> I have used Tooth Soap for almost five years. I can&#x27;t remember the last time I used regular toothpaste. Okay, it sounds weird. But I think they are really on to something. Now, no, you will not get this huge spearmint, peppermint, or whatever, burst of flavor. What are you looking for, something yummy or something that works? To me, the soap flavor is minimal and not at all unpleasant and disappears quickly. Although I prefer the liquid product, the shreds are certainly effective. I find it does a fine job of cleaning my teeth and I have experienced no dental problems whatsoever since using the product. I follow up with a Water Pik. Those who are having problems with the taste may be supertasters. For me, it has been no problem at all. Simply: I like the product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Looking for tooth soap I noticed this product has palm oil. Palm oil production is destroying the rain forest and pushing the Sumatran and Bornean orangutans to extinction. It&#x27;s really not worth it. I found and bought tooth soap on Amazon that doesn&#x27;t have palm oil. The brand name is actually \\&quot;Tooth Soap.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> My teeth we squeaky clean and just felt cleaner all day. The taste was not at all what I had expected, but with a name like &amp;#34;Tooth Soap&amp;#34; I should have. This does not whiten whatsoever, but maintains the shade you begin with.</li>
    <li> I have been using tooth soap for about 6 years. The people who clean my teeth are always amazed there is so little to do and how strong my teeth are. I have not been in need of any dental work either. I highly recommend for healthy teeth and gums!</li>
    <li> Someone recommended it to me and ended up using it 3 times.  I kept telling myself that I will get used to it and I just can&#x27;t.  It has the spearmint smell, but leaves an after taste like after you vomit, that kind of smell and taste.  Expensive and TERRIBLE!!!</li>
    <li> The strips are a pain in the neck to make them stay on the toothbrush.  You must get ready for some soap flavor. The soap is good in that is doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals in it. I ended up adding peppermint essential oil and xylitol.  Tried grinding it up into a powder and it solidified into a lump so added water and carefully poured a little on my toothbrush which worked much better. They should have this in a small pump/paste form.  Maybe they do. I&#x27;d still have to add stuff to make it&#x27;s taste tolerable. I was warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look elsewhere if you want a tooth soap or non-flouride toothpaste.</li>
