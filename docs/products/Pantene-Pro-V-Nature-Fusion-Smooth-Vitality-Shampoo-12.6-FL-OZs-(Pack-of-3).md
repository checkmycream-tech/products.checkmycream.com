      <li>I have used Pantene products for years and some are good while others are not so great.  </li>
      <li>It washes out quickly-making it ideal for someone on the go-and it even has a nice scent.</li>
      <li>I tend to lean towards more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products but this condition is one of the best I have found on the market.</li>
      <li>The avocado was just a pleasant</li>
      <li>This is a pleasantly scented Pantene conditioner that helps a lot with frizz control.</li>

      <li>It went on nicely, as I&#x27;m accustomed to with Pantene.  </li>
      <li>Pantene Pro products have always worked well for my wife and I, they are affordable, smell nice and work well.  </li>
      <li>However, it would be absolutely perfect for anyone frequently lightens, straightens, curls, or asks a lot of their hair.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine hair that is prone to dryness.</li>
      <li>Strong conditioner!</li>
      <li>We received this as a free sample, but when it runs out, we&#x27;ll be stocking up!</li>
      <li>I still have to moisturize and make sure my shampoo isn&#x27;t too drying</li>
      <li>One of my favorite conditioners.</li>
      <li>It smells great, and it really works well.  </li>
      <li>I have a lot of fly-away in my hair, and I was quite pleased with the smoothing effect.  </li>
      <li>It is not herby is more like a plant or a root smell.  </li>
      <li>I love this conditioner and will continue to use this.</li>
      <li>I tried this Pro-V smoothing conditioner with avocado and just love it.  </li>
      <li>It has a mildly pleasant scent and really coats your hair with its conditioning ingredients.  </li>
      <li>I really liked  this conditioner, it really does a better job  than most others.  </li>
      <li>I think that it would be best for individuals who want a light conditioning versus someone with dry hair.  </li>
      <li>mention on if I&#x27;d have to use other Pantene products with this conditioner for the best effects.</li>
      <li>While testing this product I discovered that the more it worked into my hair the more it was absorbed.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with this conditioner in that it does a great job at conditioning my hair, without weighing it down.  </li>
      <li>This conditioner has a light, foamy texture coming our of the bottle and applies easily.  </li>
      <li>My wife has fine, curly hair, She likes the smell of this conditioner, and it makes her hair smooth and tangle-free.</li>
      <li>condition was a *huge* step toward taming the frizz.</li>
      <li>I would use this product as a light conditioner during the heat of summer.</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair feeling smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>Oh, and did I mention it all needs to be SMOOTH?</li>
      <li>that is the first thing I notice about a Shampoo or Conditioner, it has to smell good first before I would  put in my hair.</li>
      <li>I do like this so far, loving it will have to be seen with more usage.</li>
      <li>But this conditioner allowed for very nice and easy brushing, and left her hair looking clean and</li>
      <li>Very nice for those needing an extra bit of smoothing and hydrating!</li>
      <li>This is an effective smoothing conditioner, with an attractive, altough not overwhelming fragrance.  </li>
      <li>This felt creamy and luxurious really rich in my hair.</li>
      <li>Avoided any chemical odor, or overly sweet.</li>
      <li>After the shower, I could no longer smell the avocado but the sweet fragrance did continue.  </li>
      <li>like that it uses natural oils and and are trying to give your hair items that will strengthen it, this one smell on this one is really nice.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is light and fresh, not over intoxicating like some that I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>good enough for the day.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice natural fragrance.</li>
      <li>The smell is a bit on the sweet / fruity side for me and it does tend to linger all day, but it is not overpowering or nauseating.</li>
      <li>I would not guess this is a natural color from the avocado, but it looked kind of cool.  </li>
      <li>When this product became available, I decided to try and not surprisingly it left my hair the same way while having a fresh avocado scent that smells just wonderful!</li>
      <li>Amazing frgrance and better hydration for my very dry hair</li>
      <li>The fragrance is pleasantly mild.</li>
      <li>I can definitely use something that is both gentle and helps smooth it out (shine is good, too).</li>
      <li>conditioner worked well for a smooth shine, but wasn&#x27;t as good as some of their other conditions (like the Argan oil one) at taming frizz.  </li>
      <li>Not this one my hair felt rich and soft and just really good and clean no left over sliminess.</li>
      <li>While I do use a good quality heat protectant spray before I use any heat, it only does so much.</li>
      <li>I liked the way it moisturized my hair and the way it left my hair feeling.</li>
      <li>I like how it rinses clean, not leaving my fair feeling heavy.</li>
      <li>All that and the price is right.</li>
      <li>However, while Pantene&#x27;s Pro-V&#x27;s Smoothing conditioner does seem to provide some smoothness to my hair, I noticed right away that it didn&#x27;t help with keeping it tangle-free</li>
      <li>It took the tangles off of my hair which sits right now just below the shoulders.  </li>
      <li>My daughter, who has super curly hair, is also an Irish dancer, which means we need to get it under control, smooth out the sides, make a smooth &amp;#34;poof&amp;#34; in the front, and then get it all to stay put under a wig.</li>
      <li>hair feels clean and was very style-able today.  </li>
      <li>Another conditioner I had been using previously worked much better in that regard, as well in providing more of a shine.</li>
      <li>The scent is mild but I didn&#x27;t like it much.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d be interested in trying a shampoo in this line as well.</li>
      <li>The formula actually has more vitamin B in the form of panthenol and panthonyl ethyl ether than it has avocado oil.  </li>
      <li>This conditioner is part of their Nature Fusion Smoothing line, which it appears they combine natural oils to help smooth your hair.  </li>
      <li>like most Pantene conditioners, but I turn to this one, especially, when my hair needs a conditioner that smooths my hair.</li>
      <li>Combined with product and straighteners, this might be okay for others with similar hair.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s pretty unmanageable.</li>
      <li>The consistency is great, not too thick or runny.</li>
      <li>Nice middle-of-the-road conditioner; not too heavy and not to light conditioning for normal hair.</li>
      <li>I love that it is gentle enough for color-treated or permed</li>
      <li>thing I will do, since I have color-treated, double-processed hair, is use a certain kind of shampoo and conditioner every other day.  </li>
      <li>The scent of the conditioner is much lighter than ordinary but it is still pleasant.  </li>
      <li>thing I did notice is this is gentle enough to use on permed or color treated hair so it really is a good overall conditioner for all hair types.  </li>
      <li>As soon as you open this conditioner ,you can smell the fresh, clean scent of avacado.</li>
      <li>A member of the household said this conditioner does a good job at filling out the hair to bring out full body, while not leaving behind any sticky residue.</li>
      <li>There are certain Pantene products I like</li>
      <li>As for the promise about strength - I imagine I&#x27;d have to use it for longer to be certain if it is helping to make my hair stronger</li>
      <li>Paraben Free (100% recyclable bottle-remove cap prior to recycling).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Price is reasonable.</li>
      <li>I only wish it were sulfate free as well.</li>
      <li>I have frizzies, and this tames them very well.  </li>
      <li>On the plus side, it didn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue and it smells really nice.</li>
      <li>and I find their shampoos and conditioners leave my hair feeling soft and easy to manage without breaking the bank as I find their prices reasonable, especially when they&#x27;re on sale.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is an effective smoothing conditioner, with an attractive, altough not overwhelming fragrance.  Have frizzy/poofy hair, and it did a solid job in dealing with these issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, recently tried a similar cassis based product, Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Conditioner and much prefer that.  Amazing frgrance and better hydration for my very dry hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:  good but no wow.</li>
    <li> There are certain Pantene products I like and some I don&#x27;t but this is one that I do happen to like.  I used it on my hair this morning and it&#x27;s feels soft and silky without feeling like it has build up left on.  The fragrance is light and fresh, not over intoxicating like some that I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I did notice is this is gentle enough to use on permed or color treated hair so it really is a good overall conditioner for all hair types.  I have sensitive skin and this did not bother me which is a plus.  I also massaged it into my scalp and that even feels nicely refreshed especially after a long winter of extreme cold that is ripe for drying out your scalp and hair.  I do like this so far, loving it will have to be seen with more usage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very particular about my conditioners since I have baby fine, pin straight hair that is easily weighed down and will show any amount of product buildup quickly as limp, stringy locks.  At the same time, my long locks can&#x27;t forgo conditioner altogether, otherwise it turns into a tangled mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with this conditioner in that it does a great job at conditioning my hair, without weighing it down.  It has a very mild scent and I like the color; pale green, that makes me think of avocados :0).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The front of the bottle indicates that it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;plant based bottle&amp;#34; and for some reason that&#x27;s a bit of a turnoff for me.  It seems gimmicky and I suppose it makes me think that the manufacturer is promoting the packaging rather than the product and that it&#x27;s an indirect way of saying &amp;#34;our product itself is meh but... ENVIRONMENT!&amp;#34;.  Of course, having had an opportunity to use this conditioner for awhile now, I do think it&#x27;s a good product and I would purchase it again if I saw it at my local store.</li>
    <li> I like avocado oil in fact I add a few drops to my hair sometime.  This conditioner is good.  It is not very heavy and I didn&#x27;t see any buildup on my med-fine hair.  The scent is mild but I didn&#x27;t like it much.  It is not herby is more like a plant or a root smell.  Not quite there.  It doesn&#x27;t linger long so that&#x27;s good.  It took the tangles off of my hair which sits right now just below the shoulders.  I am able to style my hair as usual, straight or wavy worked well.  Not very shiny hair but good enough for the day.  I still used a couple of drops of avocado oil even afterwards.</li>
    <li> I tend to put my hair through the heat trials - I blow dry and flatten my hair back to back some mornings and if I&#x27;m not doing that, I have a curling wand that I use on the highest setting. While I do use a good quality heat protectant spray before I use any heat, it only does so much. I still have to moisturize and make sure my shampoo isn&#x27;t too drying or I&#x27;ll end up with frizzy, lifeless hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smoothing conditioner is great at doing what it is designed for. A little bit goes a very long way with this conditioner and the product really coats your hair to provide lasting results throughout the day. I can blow dry after using this product and if I take my time with a large round brush, I can even get away without flat ironing the ends of my hair. The smell is a bit on the sweet / fruity side for me and it does tend to linger all day, but it is not overpowering or nauseating.</li>
    <li> A member of the household said this conditioner does a good job at filling out the hair to bring out full body, while not leaving behind any sticky residue. She has curly hair, and this helps keep them lively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent was good because there wasn&#x27;t any - or it was very light. Avoided any chemical odor, or overly sweet. The avocado was just a pleasant hint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinses easily, even from very thick hair.</li>
    <li> Like all Pro-V conditioners, this one is creamy, thick, and truly works wonders on hair. Now, because my hair is not dry or damaged, this conditioner was just a touch heavy for my hair type. However, it would be absolutely perfect for anyone frequently lightens, straightens, curls, or asks a lot of their hair.  Great fragrance! Strong conditioner! Very nice for those needing an extra bit of smoothing and hydrating!</li>
    <li> After kids, my once straight, shiny, thick hair turned into an Irish fro, complete with wavy coarseness that&#x27;s pretty unmanageable. I&#x27;ve tried conditioners, creams, products, but not much tames it. I&#x27;ve tried other smoothing shampoos/conditioners, and this is about as comparable. It works, but not great. On the plus side, it didn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue and it smells really nice. Combined with product and straighteners, this might be okay for others with similar hair. Price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> I have used Pantene conditioners for years.  This conditioner is different from the norm in a couple of ways.  First of all, it is slightly green in color.  Secondly, during my shower, I could distinctly smell avocado. The scent of the conditioner is much lighter than ordinary but it is still pleasant.  After the shower, I could no longer smell the avocado but the sweet fragrance did continue.  Finally, the conditioning of this version is much lighter than my usual Pantene.  I think that it would be best for individuals who want a light conditioning versus someone with dry hair.  My hair is long and depending on the time of the year, it can be very dry or not.  Usually winter is the harsher time for me as the heater is on all the time.  I would use this product as a light conditioner during the heat of summer.</li>
    <li> Pantene&#x27;s Nature Fusion with avocado oil left my hair feeling soft and luxuriant. I liked the way it moisturized my hair and the way it left my hair feeling. It has a nice natural fragrance. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair that is prone to dryness. Most conditions are too heavy and turn my hair into an oil slick, but this one is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it feels virtually weightless. It washes out quickly-making it ideal for someone on the go-and it even has a nice scent. I tend to lean towards more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products but this condition is one of the best I have found on the market. All that and the price is right. I am sticking with this one. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> As soon as you open this conditioner ,you can smell the fresh, clean scent of avacado. It comes out a little less thick than a lot of conditioners and feels light as you apply it. I like how it rinses clean, not leaving my fair feeling heavy. As I dry my hair, it appears silky and smoother , which allows for less time and not as much work trying to keep my hair smoothed down. I only wish it were sulfate free as well. I&#x27;d be interested in trying a shampoo in this line as well.</li>
    <li> This conditioner works well and has an inoffensive fragrance.  It leaves the hair shiny and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label features the phrase \\&quot;With Avocado Oil,\\&quot; but it only has a miniscule amount, certainly not enough to be functional.  The formula actually has more vitamin B in the form of panthenol and panthonyl ethyl ether than it has avocado oil.  It also contains tiny amounts of bamboo shoot and grape seed extracts.</li>
    <li> This conditioner has a light, foamy texture coming our of the bottle and applies easily.  It has a mildly pleasant scent and really coats your hair with its conditioning ingredients.  You need to spend extra effort rinsing it out, however, as it may otherwise leave your hair looking greasy and matted down.  For that reason, I don&#x27;t think I would buy this over less expensive conditioners that rinse more easily.</li>
    <li> I have used Pantene products for years and some are good while others are not so great.  I have very thin, fine hair that gets quite dry in the winter - I tried this Pro-V smoothing conditioner with avocado and just love it.  It smells great, and it really works well.  My hair was smooth with no fly always or extreme dryness after using this and my hair feels VERY soft, which is something I don&#x27;t normally get with any other conditioner.  I love this conditioner and will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pantene products on my hair for a long time. I have long and thick color treated hair and I find their shampoos and conditioners leave my hair feeling soft and easy to manage without breaking the bank as I find their prices reasonable, especially when they&#x27;re on sale. When this product became available, I decided to try and not surprisingly it left my hair the same way while having a fresh avocado scent that smells just wonderful! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to try this version if Pantene as I had reviewed a Moroccan oil version before that left an oily residue on my hair.  This is not an issue at all with the avocado oil Pantene. In fact, the conditioner was quite puffy and lightweight as it came out.  I would recommend this new version of Pantene.  I have coarse and thick hair and have been a loyal Pantene customer for years</li>
    <li> The Pro-V Conditioner by Pantene is truly wonderful.  After washing my hair, a reasonable amount leaves your hair soft and light, even after using other products on it.  It also helps the style to last a bit longer than other conditioners.  I will certainly purchase it and look forward to using it for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jodie Marino Nachison - spouse</li>
    <li> Pantene Pro products have always worked well for my wife and I, they are affordable, smell nice and work well.  This conditioner is part of their Nature Fusion Smoothing line, which it appears they combine natural oils to help smooth your hair.  The bottle highlights Avocado oil, but also has Bamboo and Grapeseed as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner worked well for a smooth shine, but wasn&#x27;t as good as some of their other conditions (like the Argan oil one) at taming frizz.  It is relative, it did help with it, but just not as much as their other types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it uses natural oils and and are trying to give your hair items that will strengthen it, this one smell on this one is really nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan from way back of Pantene products, so I was eager to try this conditioner, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed!  My first surprise was that it looked slightly green.  I would not guess this is a natural color from the avocado, but it looked kind of cool.  It had a very nice and very mild scent---one I couldn&#x27;t quite identify but liked a lot.  It went on nicely, as I&#x27;m accustomed to with Pantene.  I washed both my daughter&#x27;s hair and mine with it.  I have a lot of fly-away in my hair, and I was quite pleased with the smoothing effect.  My hair looked more in control than usual.  My daughter&#x27;s big issue is tangles, and I condition her rather heavily because of it.  Sometimes that leaves a residue type look  But this conditioner allowed for very nice and easy brushing, and left her hair looking clean and controlled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy to recommend this quality product!</li>
    <li> This Pantene conditioner is not bad by any stretch of the imagination, but I&#x27;m not a huge fan.  It certainly does add some shine and softness to my hair which I&#x27;m lacking with my last trial brand of conditioner, but I&#x27;m not sold on the color (vivid green, probably not naturally this color), and the scent, which is mild, but off-putting.</li>
    <li> Smells really good. that is the first thing I notice about a Shampoo or Conditioner, it has to smell good first before I would  put in my hair. Then how is the texture? This felt creamy and luxurious really rich in my hair. After that its all how it rinses out and leaves my hair feeling. Some conditioners feel slimy, greasy  or otherwise unnatural. Not this one my hair felt rich and soft and just really good and clean no left over sliminess. My hair also looked great after using. I really liked  this conditioner, it really does a better job  than most others.  My one  problem with this product is  it&#x27;s outrageous pricing, I don&#x27;t think I would ever spend that much on conditioner no matter how good it is.</li>
    <li> Pantene&#x27;s Pro-V Nature Fusion Smoothing Conditioner with Avocado Oil is a nice, thick conditioner that has a light scent (which rinses out) that contains natural ingredients (such as avocado) which is supposed to help make your hair smoother, shinier, and stronger. It&#x27;s also supposed to be gentle enough for color-treated and permed hair.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I fall into the first category, and I regularly flat-iron my hair when I style it, so I can definitely use something that is both gentle and helps smooth it out (shine is good, too). However, while Pantene&#x27;s Pro-V&#x27;s Smoothing conditioner does seem to provide some smoothness to my hair, I noticed right away that it didn&#x27;t help with keeping it tangle-free (I have long, fine hair, and a lot of it). Another conditioner I had been using previously worked much better in that regard, as well in providing more of a shine. I had to take extra care in combing out my hair and styling it because of the tangling issue. As for the promise about strength - I imagine I&#x27;d have to use it for longer to be certain if it is helping to make my hair stronger/less breakable.&lt;br /&gt;No mention on if I&#x27;d have to use other Pantene products with this conditioner for the best effects.</li>
    <li> Love it! Smells really good and gets the job done. One of my favorite conditioners. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Nice middle-of-the-road conditioner; not too heavy and not to light conditioning for normal hair. Smooths my fly aways well. I would recommend a deeper conditioner for dry and/or thicker hair.</li>
    <li> While testing this product I discovered that the more it worked into my hair the more it was absorbed.  This lead me to believe that it doing deep conditioning.  I have frizzies, and this tames them very well.  I&#x27;m not so concerned with what is in the product as I am about performance.  It is creamy, and I didn&#x27;t have to leave it on long before I was ready to rinse it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I will do, since I have color-treated, double-processed hair, is use a certain kind of shampoo and conditioner every other day.  Then the other days I&#x27;ll use this on my ends with no shampoo.  My hairdresser taught me that trick to extend my color and to keep me from getting dry frizzy hair in the in between days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels clean and was very style-able today.  It is night time and my hair feels like it was shampooed today.  But smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never use a blow dryer unless I&#x27;m going somewhere special; otherwise I go long and wavy.  Hair spray in strategic places allows the curl to stay in place.  Not much.  When it dries I run my fingers through it.  Works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have paid a lot of money before getting conditioners as good as this one.  I recommend it!</li>
    <li> My wife has fine, curly hair, She likes the smell of this conditioner, and it makes her hair smooth and tangle-free. She likes it.</li>
    <li> It’s been awhile since I’ve used Pantene products, so when I had the opportunity to order PRO-V NATURE FUSION SMOOTHING CONDITIONER WITH AVOCADO OIL 12FL OZ I took advantage of it.  The fragrance is pleasantly mild. The consistency is great, not too thick or runny. It’s easier to spread evenly throughout your hair. It leaves your hair feeling smooth and silky. It leaves your hair with less tangles. I love that it is gentle enough for color-treated or permed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Information:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Pack of six (12.6 oz, total of 75.6 ounces)&lt;br /&gt;• With Avocado, Bamboo and Grapeseed, this shampoo helps protect your hair against damage and reveal your natural radiance; With Cassia Complex, helps lock out unwanted humidity and smoothes hair fibers to help get a smooth, controlled look&lt;br /&gt;• Gentle enough for color-treated or permed hair&lt;br /&gt;• For silky smoothness and up to 10x stronger hair&lt;br /&gt;• Paraben Free (100% recyclable bottle-remove cap prior to recycling).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Description:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro-V Nature Fusion Smoothing Conditioner with Avocado Oil, Powered by Cassia. For silky smoothness and strength against damage.</li>
    <li> My daughter, who has super curly hair, is also an Irish dancer, which means we need to get it under control, smooth out the sides, make a smooth &amp;#34;poof&amp;#34; in the front, and then get it all to stay put under a wig. Oh, and did I mention it all needs to be SMOOTH? Needless to say, this is no small feat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This condition was a *huge* step toward taming the frizz. It was about a thousand times easier than usual to comb through her hair after she used it. This allowed me to pull it up, create the poof, etc. We fixed her hair at 10 a.m. and then used hairspray. She danced at 1:30. By 3:00, the frizz was still under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a hair straightener, so she still have plenty of waves, but it didn&#x27;t look like she&#x27;d just taken a tumble in an electric dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells really good, too.  We received this as a free sample, but when it runs out, we&#x27;ll be stocking up!</li>
    <li> This is a pleasantly scented Pantene conditioner that helps a lot with frizz control. This is a time of high humidity where I live, and my hair can get very frizzy and, frankly, a bit out of control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like most Pantene conditioners, but I turn to this one, especially, when my hair needs a conditioner that smooths my hair. This conditioner makes it very easy to comb through my hair when wet, and when it&#x27;s dry it has the look I want.</li>
