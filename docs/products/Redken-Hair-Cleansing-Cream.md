      <li>I love this shampoo!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>I used to use another popular clarifying shampoo for color treated hair and switched to this one.</li>
      <li>The goal was to get the hair spray out of my hair and it does the job nicely.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve since run out and am looking to purchase my own shampoo.</li>
      <li>Nice shampoo.</li>
      <li>It does not have a fruity or good smelling scent to it like most shampoos.</li>
      <li>Just make sure to use a good conditioner afterward.</li>

      <li>It is a good strong cleaner and literally</li>
      <li>Bottle is very easy to use.</li>
      <li>love love this shampoo!</li>

      <li>I liked this SM shampoo/conditioner so well that I tried the SM Manuka Honey s/c and love it.  </li>
      <li>Got my hair bleached and I decided to buy products to make it look nice and healthy again</li>
      <li>makes your hair feel really clean and smell good but did nothing for helping to remove the rust and calcium build-up.  </li>
      <li>It smells like oranges and so for some may be very strong, personally I love the smell.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>This allows whichever conditioner you use to penetrate the hair shaft instead of just sitting on top of whatever products you have built up over it.</li>

      <li>I love this clarifying shampoo.</li>

      <li>I have a lot more body now that all the residue is out.</li>
      <li>Love this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>I just love it.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>e.g. I like to use coconut oil to treat my hair once a week to keep it in tip top shape.  </li>
      <li>It smells great, and my hair feels so clean and fresh after using.</li>
      <li>I do use a very rich conditioner after shampooing and that probably helps the itchy scalp as well.</li>
      <li>Full bodied hair, good lift at root (where I do not condition) and a nice fresh citrus scent.  </li>

      <li>Wow, this stuff is great.  </li>
      <li>All SM shampoos are sulfate free and therefore color safe.  </li>
      <li>Ultimately, it&#x27;s a great clarifying shampoo, but I would not recommend if your have naturally greasy hair.</li>
      <li>The bonus is: it smells really nice and fresh.</li>
      <li>**extraordinarily** damaged hair, and have probably purchased around 500 different products-- from shampoos to conditioners, from oils to creams-- in hopes to find the product(s) that will help my hair looks its best.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Not what I expected. Makes my hair dry. I guess it should be that way since you have to use it once a month.</li>
    <li> it works!  I have well water that turns my whites and my hair orange.  I use Ironout in my laundry and Redken on my hair....only about once a month though and make sure you slather on a great conditioner after using this shampoo though because your hair will feel like straw after washing with it if you don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This product seriously saved me from having to get my hair cut! Who knew build up would make your hair frizzy, even if all you are using are natural oils?</li>
    <li> 5*A+ Accurate Description ~ Packaged with Great Care in Durable mailer ~ FAST Shipping ~ Thank You!</li>
    <li> Have chlorine pool and swim almost daily. Use this product to make sure to get all the chlorine out of my color treated hair.  Does not leave it dry but very manageable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve deleted my prior review.. Be careful with this product.... I used it once every 3 weeks to remove any buildup on my relaxed hair. I&#x27;ve done ths for months and months.... The last time I used it... It completely stripped all of the oil from my hair and left me with matted  roots and tangled ends. I couldn&#x27;t belive it. It took me hours of  repeated oils and conditioner applications before I could get my fingers thoroug my  hair. Sadly I lost the strands that tangled and haven&#x27;t recovered from the damage as my hair is still breaking.  I don&#x27;t understand what happened but I won&#x27;t be using this ever again.</li>
    <li> I cannot live without this product! I use it in combo with my regular shampoo and conditioner.  Even if I go one day without using it my hair feels heavy.  I have really thick, wavy hair and it helps to keep my hair feeling light and not weighed down.</li>
    <li> love love this shampoo! hard to find in local stores, so i cruised the net! received in a timely fashion, price was about the same. will order again.</li>
    <li> It really works! I have extremely long and thick hair and product build up just tends to happen from styling it everyday but it got to the point where my shampoo was not getting rid of the product in my hair! I switched shampoos four times thinking that would help until I read online you need a cleanser for that so I tried this and it works I left it in my hair for 5 mins and my hair afterwards felt so smooth!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! I use it every week, thank you also, for the shipping it was package prefect.</li>
    <li> This is the best cleansing shampoo ever!! I was previously using Neutrogena Clarifying Shampoo, and I didn&#x27;t like it: it was harsh and made my hair feel like straw, and smelled strongly chemically. But, I really needed something, because I have coarse wavy hair and I use endless products to tame the beast, which leaves quite a residue after a short time.&lt;br /&gt;Then, I found this shampoo about 2 months ago...it is AMAZING! It smells delicious (and I almost always hate strong scents, but this is just a pleasant floral/fruit sort of smell) and it manages to completely remove residue while leaving my hair still happy and moisturized! I&#x27;m thrilled! My only problem is having to force myself not to over-use this! I use it every 2 weeks or so, and I&#x27;m really happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair and my hair seems to last longer between washes when I use this shampoo.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I have really thick curly hair and I straighten it everyday with a round brush and blow dryer. I need to have soft hair to get the brush to run through it. This was the ticket! I use it about every other shampooing with my regular shampoo. Makes my hair feel incredible.</li>
    <li> Great gentle cleansing shampoo.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo only once every two weeks.  It clarifies beautifully, and leaves my hair \\&quot;bouncy\\&quot; and responsive to styling products.  Because I use it only every two weeks, it lasts quite a while.  A bargain.</li>
    <li> I moved to a home in NE FL that has well water with ridiculous amounts of iron and scale. My hair became dull, frizzy, and never felt clean. This product solved my problem. Hair is clean and shiny again! Just make sure to use a good conditioner afterward.</li>
    <li> This works great at removing all the build up and whatnot, but i believe it dries my hair a tiny bit, i only use it once every 1-2 weeks. the actual bottle is very thin and cheap.</li>
    <li> I was stoked about the previous reviews so I took a chance on this.  I have super fine hair that gets greasy.  I work out daily so it needs to be washed.  I also read that doing a clarifying shampoo once a week can help make hair shiny.  This however was too drying, my hair felt like straw, and needed a deeper conditioner than what I normally use.  Won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Nothing but positives for this stuff!!! I&#x27;m a believer in clarifying shampoo now :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS:&lt;br /&gt;My hair is so soft I can&#x27;t believe it!!! I&#x27;ve only used it once and plan to use it as needed to remove flaky, dry scalp and dull hair that comes from my hairspray and flat iron/curling iron dependencies. I went from having white cakey flakes all around the scalp on my face to just one small spot of flakes. Nothing short of amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USE:&lt;br /&gt;I followed instructions from an article online. I massaged a nickel-sized amount into my scalp for 60 seconds, then rinsed really, really, really well (the trick is, you don&#x27;t want to leave any of it in or it&#x27;ll dry your hair out). Then I gently combed a quarter-sized amount into my hair and let it sit for 2 minutes, and rinsed really, really, really well. Note - I have mid-back length naturally curly hair that is pretty thick, and I still didn&#x27;t overdo the amount to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY PROBLEM:&lt;br /&gt;I tried this because my hair has been looking brittle and parched and wouldn&#x27;t behave. The final straw: I had major dry flakes on my scalp lining my face (from ear to ear). It wasn&#x27;t dandruff, it was just very dry and no amount of conditioner or shampoo would change it. i decided to clarify and found this product came recommended online.</li>
    <li> I stumbled upon this product while researching shampoos on Amazon.  I have silver hair with quite a bit of curl and use a lot of product for styling. Hadn&#x27;t felt that my hair felt particularly clean after shampooing so this shampoo caught my attention.  Well, all I can say, is that it does what it says!  My hair was totally clean and soft after my first use.  Actually went an extra day between its use and my next shampoo.  Will definitely continue to use.</li>
    <li> Was looking around for a clarifying shampoo that works with colored hair and this works. As this product strips your hair of buildup, it probably feels more drying than what regular shampoo does so I suggest following up with a conditioner or some sort of moisturizing product for your hair. Keeps your hair stronger and keeps your hair with lift after regular usage.</li>
    <li> I used to use another popular clarifying shampoo for color treated hair and switched to this one. I really like how clean it gets my hair and always use it prior to coloring.</li>
    <li> highly recommend! gets my 4c hair clean. it gives a nice rich lather!! i sectioned my hair into four and used a quarter size dallop on each section. highly recommend if u have hard water, or have alot of product buildup. highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the best cleansing shampoo I have ever used. I have very fine hair that shows oil build up after a day, so I usually don&#x27;t go a day without washing my hair. But this stuff is an oil killer, so much so that I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using more than once a week, even with oily hair, for fear of drying your hair out. It smells great, and my hair feels so clean and fresh after using. Also since I only use it a few times a month, it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I use it alternately with another shampoo and my hair feels so clean when I use it.</li>
    <li> I love this clarifying shampoo. It leaves my hair looking great. I only use it once a week or every other week and it has made a huge difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> I prefer shampoos that are of a clear liquid, and I have never liked shampoos that are creamy. But this one that is a Cleansing Cream seems to work good.  My hair felt clean but not stripped of all oils.  I will use this one once a week.</li>
    <li> This shampoo definitely cleans hair products from my hair, but I have noticed I have an itchy scalp after I use it.</li>
    <li> the most awesome shampoo for my color treated hair!  smells great too!</li>
    <li> Knowing older hair needs more acidic, conditioning type cleansers, I have tried super expensive cleansing creams, like Wen and many other high end brands. This one beats them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 14 year old daughter and I have stick thin hair. Hers is  of medium thickness and mine is fragile and thin. We both LOVE this cleansing cream shampoo. It leaves our hair smooth and clean. After using this shampoo, my fragile hair looks its most lustrous and the ends look smooth rather than their usual fried appearance. We discovered using a mild conditioner FIRST, rinsing out and then using this cleansing cream last creates the cleanest, most silky effect on our hair.</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of clarifying shampoo&#x27;s and this seems to work the best</li>
    <li> The Joico is so much better. Leaves your hair softer. I notice that using this if I don&#x27;t leave it on long enough it doesn&#x27;t do anything. Any longer and hair looks dried out and brittle. My other favorite mentioned earlier, really does the trick once a week to remove residue and leave hair clean and soft. Not this one. In the garbage now.</li>
    <li> Excellent product... So creamy ... Cleanses very well yet does not dry out the product.... Will definitely recommend this to everyone</li>
    <li> One of the best clarifying shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my already dry and removes all of the buildup in my hair after days of product. Only using this every two weeks before a deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> I used to much toner on my blonde hair and it turned grey. I used this and Redken clear moisture conditioner and it turned my hair back to blonde.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I tend to use a lot of products in my hair, so I use this shampoo once a week to get rid of the buildup. This allows whichever conditioner you use to penetrate the hair shaft instead of just sitting on top of whatever products you have built up over it. Highly recommended, especially to use in conjunction with a deep conditioning treatment.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I wash my hair twice and use this product first to get all the product build up out.</li>
    <li> This is the only hair cleansing product I have ever used. I use it twice a month and I really like it.</li>
    <li> This has been my go to shampoo for once a week cleansing for a few years now.  I&#x27;ve tried others, and always come back to this one.</li>
    <li> Smells great and does the job! It only requires a little bit of shampoo to get a good lather and my hair feels amazing after I use it.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist suggested that I purchase this to help get rid of the build up on my hair.  I use it a couple times a week and what a difference!</li>
    <li> I use this every two weeks to strip my hair of any build up. It definitely does its job. After I use it my hair feels like it&#x27;s brand new if that makes any sense. Make sure you use a good conditioning cream after this though because your hair will feel like a tangled mess</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t act like a cream - it is pretty aggressive (more so than regular shampoo), and left my hair tangled and hard to comb. Not at all what I expected.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Great Seller!</li>
    <li> I need to leave it in the full 10 minutes and I also blow warm air on my bangs to help activate it better.</li>
    <li> FINALLY something to get that chlorine smell and feel out of my swim team son&#x27;s hair!  Hallelujah!!!!!  SOOOO thankful that my hairdresser recommended this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A follow-up with Smooth Down Redken conditioner during his post-pool shower and his hair is no longer stiff all swim season!</li>
    <li> It has a light smell, delicate and pretty - I&#x27;ll start with that, since scent should be considered before buying anything that has scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a clarifying shampoo, so I was a little scared to buy ANY considering the reviews of all clarifying shampoos that say customers&#x27; hair came out dry -- and stayed that way, some say, even for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second day after shampoo, and I noticed immediately after washing it out that my hair did not feel as moisturized as it does with my regular sulfate-free shampoo (L&#x27;oreal Eversleek Reparative Smoothing), but it was expected. My hair took to the deep conditioner I used afterwards, and my hair feels lighter, as in not weighed down by all the oils I usually put. Some may recommend a clarifying shampoo once a week. I&#x27;ll use it once a month to prevent excessive drying, and the bottle should last me almost a year, so it&#x27;s worth the price for the 10 ounces.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this shampoo about once or twice week to \\&quot;clarify\\&quot; or clean my hair from all the nasty buildup and grease. It provides a decent lather. I initially got scared that this product would dry out my hair. Mainly because immediately after rinsing, my hair actually felt a bit tight (squeaky clean tightness).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the effect of this product can be seen AFTER the hair is dried.&lt;br /&gt;After use, my hair is SO SOFT and SO CLEAN. My head feels so fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And mind you, my hair is usually the opposite of soft (note: thick, frizzy, unruly, dry and tangled).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ooh and the smell is so nice and fresh - subtle summery, citrusy, but not overly sweet. TWO THUMBS UP!</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because for my own personal experience, it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything more for my hair and scalp than my regular Redken shampoo.  Decent shampoo though.</li>
    <li> Perfect for grey hair.  Keeps my hair from yellowing and is non-drying.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I&#x27;ve only used it one wash but I can tell a huge difference in my hair. I live in the mountains and we definitely have hard water. I usually can&#x27;t brush through my hair after showering without soaking it in detangler. I didn&#x27;t have to use any detangler after using this shampoo. I do use miracle 7 silk conditioner (purple bottle) after using the redken shampoo. My hair was visibly smoother, and way more soft to the touch. I probably won&#x27;t use more than twice a week, because it does clean EVERY bit of oil out of your hair, which I&#x27;m sure will dry it out if used too much. Other than that, I LOVE this shampoo. It also smells good but it&#x27;s not an overpowering scent.</li>
    <li> We have hard water. My hair used to be super blonde but isn&#x27;t anymore. I hate it. So I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. It works great!!! I&#x27;ve only used this for a month, 2-3 times a week. My hair is getting light again and shiny!! I&#x27;m not sure if its just this shampoo working because I&#x27;ve been using Malibu C Hard Water Conditioner(which is so awesome too!). This smells so beach-y, I love the scent so much! It doesn&#x27;t seem to stay around for long though. It compliments the Malibu C Hard Water Conditioner so well, they both have similar scents. Bottle is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> New to us, a switch from Framesi.  Like the texture and the scent, and it seems to work well for hair that has been colored.</li>
    <li> Have dry fine hair.  This works great.  I plan to reorder</li>
    <li> I have short hair and I use a lot of styling products to get it to do what I want it to do every day.  These products can build up on my hair and make it flat and lifeless.  Almost sticky and greasy if you will.  Once a week I wash it out with the Redken Cleansing Cream.  It is a good strong cleaner and literally \\&quot;strips\\&quot; out all of the products left behind in my hair and gives me a clean slate to start all over with again.  I love it.  It also doesn&#x27;t make your hair straw like, it cleans without drying out.  You don&#x27;t have to follow up with a severe conditioner that would start weighing your hair down right away.  I love it.</li>
    <li> great for my silver hair!</li>
    <li> Love this! I get use a lot of dry shampoo and only wash my hair once a week and this gets all the gunk and dirt out of my hair for my weekly wash and it smells amazing too!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my hairdresser who only carries organic products in her shop. She said to go online and look for it. It is the best product she has used to clean built up conditioning and hairspray from her hair. The bottle says to use it alternately with your regular shampoo, but my hairdresser recommended that it be used just before my next color treatment. I followed her advice, but  could not see that it damaged my hair color. My hair feels cleaner and shinier than I can remember.</li>
    <li> I normally have somewhat greasy hair so I bought this thinking that it would clarify as well as help with the greasiness. I only use this about once a month, and when I do, I find that my hair gets greasier quicker with this than with regular shampoo. Ultimately, it&#x27;s a great clarifying shampoo, but I would not recommend if your have naturally greasy hair.</li>
    <li> I work at a pool as a swim instructor, water aerobic instructor and supervisor, so I&#x27;m constantly in the pool. This shampoo was left behind by someone. (This actually happens quite a lot at pools with hair care products, believe it or not.) I took a chance and used it when I ran out of my regular shampoo. I was amazed. This shampoo worked like a charm against the chlorine. My hair felt normal again! I&#x27;ve since run out and am looking to purchase my own shampoo. My hair is thin and fine, but felt so much more fuller afterwards. I&#x27;m a fan of Dove&#x27;s line of shampoo and conditioners, so the conditioner i used afterwards was the intensive repair or nurturing oil-care conditioner (one of the two).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any problem with my hair getting dried out, but then again there was only enough left for one or two washes.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo for color treated hair.  Cleans without washing out the hair color.  The shampoo is a bit expensive, but works well.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend.  I use it once a week to clean hair from any build up.  Great smell, not oily.  Leaves hair feeling wonderfully clean.</li>
    <li> My Hairdresser suggested a $70, 20 minute, treatment to remove the build-up of minerals on my hair due to  the hard water in out town.  I found this product on Amazon. Although it is not inexpensive it does the job.  I use it once a week to wash my hair , which is now softer, fuller and fluffier.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  It smells great and just a quarter size amount is enough to cleanse your hair of all the product build up.  I use it once a week and when rinsing I can feel how clean my hair should be.  (But what do I do right after that?  I toss conditioners on it, dry it, spray it and the vicious cycle of hair styling starts all over again.)</li>
    <li> THIS is why I buy Redken. Use it once or twice a week depending on how much hair care products you use for a thorough cleaning. It&#x27;s basically a stripper that gets the crap out of your hair. It&#x27;s a good alternate shampoo with great natural scent that has a \\&quot;you know it&#x27;s working\\&quot; effect. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I was worried this would dry out my hair, which it might had I not used condioner.  What I noticed just after the first use of leaving it on for 5 minutes before rinsing was my hair was super clean and it allowed my usual conditioner to work that much better.  Full bodied hair, good lift at root (where I do not condition) and a nice fresh citrus scent.  Love it.  Plan to use once a week.  It also lightened up my blonde which was turning more of a gold dingy color so that was a plus for me.  So I&#x27;d be careful if you have color treated hair just in case it might change your color and you dont happen to like it.</li>
    <li> i have really hard water and it didn&#x27;t help at all.  makes your hair feel really clean and smell good but did nothing for helping to remove the rust and calcium build-up.  also had crappy customer service.  there was a mix up in the mail and i originally paid for shipping and i finally received it 2 weeks later than what i was told. and i never received the 1st original bottle.  the seller was ez to get a hold of and they told me to let them when i received the &amp;#34;lost bottle&amp;#34; and the 2nd one they sent out.  needless to say i only received 1 bottle 2 weeks later.  will never ever buy from them again</li>
    <li> This one keeps your hair so soft without drying it out, as many clarifying shampoos have a tendency to do.  Your hair feels completely clean.  This is a great poo for after deep oil treatments.. e.g. I like to use coconut oil to treat my hair once a week to keep it in tip top shape.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Really does remove all the product buildup in your hair. I use it once a week before a deep conditioning treatment to keep my hair smooth and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lovely shampoo &amp; conditioner in one, however, I&#x27;m not getting the results as promised.  Just clean hair. I would not recommend this product for the application for which it&#x27;s advertised.</li>
    <li> One of the only mid end hair products I&#x27;ve found that&#x27;s actually worth forking over the extra cash for. Deep cleans but still leaves hair feeling moisturized and soft. Used in conjunction with the Extreme line, my hair looks better than it has since I was a teenager.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair super shiny and love to use it every other shampoo along with Pureology Strength Cure on my colored hair. THanks for the great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> Redken Hair Cleansing Cream Shampoo is decent as a clarifying shampoo.  Whether it is what you are looking for depends on your needs.  It is not a strong clarifying shampoo that rips all of the residue from one&#x27;s scalp, but it does removes product residue fairly well without stripping the hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Redken products.  I&#x27;ve been using this cleansing shampoo for around 10 years.  Only use it about once a week for a depp clean.  I also use it when my hair is gunked up from a swim.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist used this on my in the salon and I loved it. When I ordered it myself and used it I hated it. It worsened my dry scalp and made my dandruff flair up. I was very disappointed and returned the product.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this for removing chlorine from my hair after swimming.  I&#x27;d had a very itchy scalp before, perhaps from the chlorine or perhaps from other drying products or conditions.  I swim twice a week and now I use this shampoo after being in the pool.  I&#x27;ve had less trouble with itchy scalp. I really like the way this product works, the lather and the fruity fragrance.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle and will continue to use it. I do use a very rich conditioner after shampooing and that probably helps the itchy scalp as well.</li>
    <li> I have **extraordinarily** damaged hair, and have probably purchased around 500 different products-- from shampoos to conditioners, from oils to creams-- in hopes to find the product(s) that will help my hair looks its best.  I am a very big fan of Redken products, so when I saw this Redken Cleansing Cream Shampoo at my hairdresser&#x27;s, I asked about it.  She highly recommended it for use once per week, so I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleansing cream shampoo is *NOT* like most cleansing conditioners (such as Wen cleansing conditioner, Mizani cleansing cream, or Loreal EverCreme cleansing cream).  It is a cream *shampoo*, not a cleansing *conditioner*.  This product is intended to strip products from the hair, not to moisturize damaged hair.  Because it is a stripper, it should not be used daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my damaged hair, I put a lot of products in it to calm it down.  I alternate among Redken AllSoft Oil, Redken Diamond Oil, It&#x27;s a 10 Spray, and several other such products.  While I use other shampoos or cleansing conditioners MOST days, I do use this Redken Cleansing Cream Shampoo once per week to strip all those other products from my hair.  It works beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT recommend using this product every day; it is too hard on the hair.  But for use to strip styling products from the hair, this shampoo couldn&#x27;t do a better job!</li>
    <li> Good product. Arrived on time. The goal was to get the hair spray out of my hair and it does the job nicely. Only takes a small amount.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is pretty harsh on your hair.  It tends to dry it out which is great for my oily hair.  It helps keep the green, from my well water, out of my freshly highlighted hair.  It does not have a fruity or good smelling scent to it like most shampoos.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo for oily hair that I have ever used in my life.  You aren&#x27;t supposed to use it daily but I have seen a real difference in my hair using it at least 1 to 2 times a week.  I love it!  I haven&#x27;t tried the conditioner but I plan to.</li>
    <li> this shampoo is a great alternative to your regular&lt;br /&gt;shampoo if you shampoo daily or use strong hair&lt;br /&gt;spray.  Cleans EVERYTHING out pf your hair!</li>
    <li> Wow, this stuff is great.  I have very hard water and after about two weeks my hair starts to get fly away and stringy.  When my hair starts to do that I use this shampoo and all of that goes away.  This stuff leaves my hair feeling soft, very soft, and no more static fly away hair or stringy ends.</li>
    <li> I ordered this specifically because I am pregnant and it seems that I can NEVER get my hair untangled. Using this product once a week in place of my normal shampoo has made combing my hair easy again! I always use Redken products, so am glad to add this one to my mix.</li>
    <li> This shampoo totally stripped my color.  It says it&#x27;s for &amp;#34;all hair types&amp;#34;, which I took to mean exactly what it says.  Silly me!!  I watched my precious, expensive, hair color go right down the drain...literally!!  I&#x27;m not a happy camper by any stretch of the imagination.  True, I guess it does remove buildup, but I didn&#x27;t expect to get out of the shower and have a brassy, faded head of hair.  Yes, it was light and bouncy.  But it totally destroyed a $100 color service so that now I have to back to the salon with my tail between my legs and have it done over.  What a waste!! And it is completely the fault of a $15 bottle of shampoo.  Ridiculous!!  I have since found a color safe clarifying shampoo that works like a charm.  Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil shampoo is sulfate free and has apple cider vinegar.  It removes all traces of sticky styling product and hairspray residue and leaves my hair shiny and soft and my precious hair color gorgeously intact.  There is also a companion conditioner that works great.  And the two products smell wonderful, really clean and fresh.  I had to return to the salon to have my color done over after using this Redken shampoo.  I wish I had discovered Shea Moisture first!!  I use the SM shampoo every week or two and leave the lather on for about 5 minutes.  My hair is super shiny and soft and not dry at all.  I liked this SM shampoo/conditioner so well that I tried the SM Manuka Honey s/c and love it.  I also use the honey mask once a week for about 45 minutes or so using a heat cap.  My hair has never looked better.  All SM shampoos are sulfate free and therefore color safe.  The honey formula gives me just the right amount of hydration without making my hair flat.  The lather is luxurious and the conditioner is really thick and rich.  But only Target and Ulta carry the honey formula.  But there is a SM formula for every hair issue, so there&#x27;s bound to be one that will work for you.  For now, if your hair is color treated. don&#x27;t use this Redken shampoo.  You&#x27;ll be very, very sorry, especially when you have to sheepishly face your stylist to have your color redone!!treated. don&#x27;t use this Redken shampoo.  You&#x27;ll be very, very sorry, especially when you have to sheepishly face your stylist to have your color redone!!</li>
    <li> I had a lot of product build-up in my hair and this shampoo rinsed it right out. My head and hair feel really good and I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments since using it. I have a lot more body now that all the residue is out. The bonus is: it smells really nice and fresh.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I have highlighted hair and have very hard water. I use this once a week to keep the hair color fresh and to keep the hard water sediment from building up on the hair. This is a clarifying shampoo-not meant for daily use.</li>
    <li> My hair feels so clean after I use this! Exactly what I was looking for. SN: make sure to use a good conditioner with this because it will dry your hair out.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shampoo because I have over 90% gray hair and I&#x27;ve had issues with yellowing due to the hard water and heat styling.  After trying every  purple shampoo that&#x27;s been recommended with little success, this product was recommended to me by a hair stylist.  I cannot begin to praise it highly enough. First use showed a noticeable difference and by the second use all yellowing was gone from my hair leaving it a soft shiny silver again.  It smells like oranges and so for some may be very strong, personally I love the smell.  Previous reviews I read said it leaves hair very dry.  This was not an issue for me , so that likely depends on hair type.</li>
    <li> thank you, just as promised</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t change you life or stop your hair from falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FWIW:  I&#x27;m a man with fairly short, baby-fine hair and I rarely use styling products like pomade or gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must add that this product is simply not in the same category as say, Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Shampoo.</li>
    <li> Item arrived as promised and Packaged very well.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel amazingly clean</li>
    <li> I use this every time I shampoo (every or every other day)  I realized don&#x27;t even need conditioner And no my hair doesn&#x27;t dry out, it makes my hair sooo soft I just love it. My hair is fine but thick/full.</li>
    <li> It is perfect for purify my hair</li>
    <li> Great to use once a week or periodically to truly cleanse the hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> Very favorite shampoo at a good price.</li>
    <li> Found this product in my search for a clarifying shampoo. I have thin, longer hair. I use blow dyer/straightener on my hair daily. &amp; tons of products. I&#x27;ve never used any redken products before, but this was awesome. I usually use this about once a week as a substitute for my regular shampoo/conditioner.  You don&#x27;t even need to use a conditioner with this shampoo. It gets all the &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; out &amp; smells wonderful. Will definitely be using regularly.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Another fantastic Redken product! I have oily hair which I need to wash at a minimum of every other day. This shampoo allows me that extra day without looking like a bag lady! I use with a color-friendly Redken conditioner and my hair is silky smooth. A winner that I will buy again - I&#x27;m fussy and can&#x27;t say that bout a lot of products!</li>
    <li> Got my hair bleached and I decided to buy products to make it look nice and healthy again and this one really helped, used it before applying a protein on my hair and now it is nice and smooth.</li>
