<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have always had split-end problems. I am in the military, thus I have to constantly where my hair up every day which damages my hair a lot and I move around so often its hard to know what the water is going to be like. Since purchasing and using the full treatment Pro-Mend line (these three to include the overnight leave in treatment) my hair has looked and felt healthier and I&#x27;ve been able to go without a haircut for longer. After coming back from deployment my hair stylist was impressed with how well my ends have held up. I will recommend this product to anyone who has bad split-end problems. The price is great for the amount you get. Just one of these kits has lasted me 3 months and going; and thats using it every day.</li>
    <li> Especially love the leave in conditioner - use a hot iron straigtener every time I wash my hair.  This product protects without building up.</li>
    <li> I love this set!  Smells amazing, just enough moisture to keep my hair shiny and manageable without feeling weighed down.  Good Value!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently using the leave-in and the shine serum. I didn&#x27;t buy them on amazon, but I definitely should leave another comment on it, &#x27;cause it is just so amazing. I dyed the bottom half of my hair by my own, and the ends were awful 2 months ago, but I started using Nexxus pro-mend leave-in and shine serum like a month ago, and my hair looks almost the way it looked before the dying!! Besides, it smells great (I can&#x27;t stop puting my hair to my nose to smell it!!), it&#x27;s not the sweet/floral scent that might give you nauseas, but it&#x27;s like a nice smell, that lasts for days and won&#x27;t get you tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend it, but I bought it on walmart instead, since they have these products even cheaper. I doubt I&#x27;ll ever buy expensive hair products ;)</li>
    <li> I have tried Nexxus products and love them. The shampoo is a rich delicious lather, conditioner allows me to gently detangle my curly hair. The bonus leave in treatment is my new favorite product.</li>
    <li> The picture is misleading. The product itself is great, but the reason for to rating is that product you receive is much smaller.</li>
    <li> The 33.8 oz bottle size I order from the picture is not what I received. The product I received was a 22 oz size bottle.</li>
    <li> I bought this for purpose of switching shampoos every so often. Good shampoo, good conditioner, the split end leave in treatment is all I have left, I use it from time to time. I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working but it&#x27;s a good deal for the money.</li>
    <li> Good buy. Fast sipping</li>
    <li> The only good on this item was speed delivery. It is not the size its shown on picture. I did have this item before and size was 24 oz and what I received today was 13.4 oz . It is not right they lie people this way.  Of course  they know that returning will cost more to costumers !!!very very sad and disappointed,,,,never again this item online</li>
    <li> Her hair is nicer smother. no more nappy hair! Nexxus brings the sexy hair back. I really recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair treatment. My daughter said she noticed it working in less than one week. This is not inexpensive but if you use the amount recommend it will last you a while. It seems it works best when you order the 3pack. Recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Best Hair product kit on the market for split ends. Since I started using this product, my hairdresser thought I was getting an additional conditioning treatment.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair kind of frizzy. Smells good and my hair isn&#x27;t dry, just unmanagable. Maybe I just need a haircut. :)</li>
    <li> The packaging was perfect.  I was so proud of the savings.  I made off like a bandit.  Since I am a giver and give away everything, I said to myself: &amp;#34;Nobody is getting this.  Nobody!&amp;#34;  I used it once.  Its richness felt better than any Nexxus shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  Then my granddaughter graduated.  Then she was moving away from her mom.  Guess what.  Because it came so beautifully packaged already, I sent it off with my daughter with the instructions:  &amp;#34;Drop it in a gift bag for our graduate and present it at her graduation party.  I miss my Nexxus, Pro Mend Shampoo and am about to reorder it shortly.  I am very impressed with the size of the bonus Leave-in Treatment.</li>
    <li> I love it so much cause real resolve my hair look better than before more healthy! I will order it again when it is empty!</li>
    <li> Love it. Controls the frizz and my hair feels so healthy. Best I&#x27;ve found so far. Very nourishing and effective.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products that Nexxus sales and the price is just right.  I love it and have recommend that all of my friends try this product.</li>
    <li> i love this! its a great deal. i usually get the big bottles at costco for $20-$30 each. i love the leave in treatment the most. it smells great and works. my hair dresser has noticed a difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> As mentioned in previous reviews, this is NOT the item I received. I took a gamble knowing that I might not receive the described product, so I am not going to attempt to return this or officially complain; however, I hope other buyers know that receiving a smaller item, 13.5 oz each in my case, could be VERY likely. Thus far, I do like the product itself, so I cannot say anything negative about it.</li>
    <li> Good value.  Gift set large bottles. Just as the picture looks. Good price too !  This is my normal shampoo .</li>
    <li> I love how my hair feels after using this produxt. It really has helped with my split ends. It smells delightful too. I really do love this shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> I just started using these products. They smell lovely and my hair feels soft. The split ends are getting better. Nexxus is a great brand!</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t the typical Nexxus product that I am used to.  I don&#x27;t like how it smells, or feels, on my hair.  will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of suds and it makes my hair feel deliciously soft.  The smell is phenomenal (like baking vanilla). The bottle sizes are a perfect size so I don&#x27;t get tired of it before it runs out and also great for travel</li>
    <li> I decided to try this after using bed head repair system and I will be going back to it. My hair was soft and healthy before now it just feels dry and my ends break.</li>
    <li> I ALWAYS use NEXXUS, but I usually buy it from my local Walgreen&#x27;s, but with this price that is offered on Amazon ya just can&#x27;t beat it... I usually spend $11.00 on the 13.5 oz shampoo, and about $19.00 for the conditioner 13.5oz.... But these are bigger bottles, and it comes with a leave in conditioner!!!! WOW!!  I am very pleased with this order, and as an added bonus I received it in less than 2 days!!</li>
    <li> not large bottles shown in picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the small 13.9 oz, instead of the large bottles shown. its misleading even if the write up correct.!</li>
    <li> All of my friends love this shampoo and conditioner but it doesn&#x27;t work well for me. It does repair my hair, I can tell it looks healthy even though I am way past due for a trim but It leaves my hair feeling stripped or something. I have curly frizzy hair that requires a lot of conditioner to feel smooth and silky and no matter how much I use or leave it on it never feels conditioned. BUT the leave in treatment is AMAZING. I will be buying this from now on.</li>
    <li> I find that these products greatly improve the texture and strength of my hair. The products shipped are exactly as they appear in the advertisement.. 23 ounce bottles of shampoo and conditioner and a generous 4.8 ounce bonus of leave in treatment.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!  It is amazing on my daughters curly ringlet hair!  Only hair product I will use on her!</li>
    <li> The Pro mend products have been the Only thing to help my hair since I have been pregnant!  I started out using the promend night treatment alone on my hair before I was pregnant because it was dry, tangly, staticy, and color teated, I Loved that product alone, at that time I  was using Pureology Shampoo and Conditioner.  Since I have been pregnant though my hair looks like an old broom and it didn&#x27;t seem like there was anything I could do!  I use to be a hairstylist so believe me when I say I tried EVERYTHING! I decided to try the whole Promend set (shampoo, Conditioner, daily treatment and over night treatment) and my hair is wonderful now! I recommend getting all four products but surprisingly even the shampoo/conditioner alone will help</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this system for about two months now, I have long platinum blonde hair that I have dyed many colors and has had quite a bit of processing going on. I really like this system, and the smell is fantastic. However, I bought a set of this at around $16.00 at Costco, and then because I liked it so much I went back and bought four more sets. I&#x27;m stocked up for about 6 months now, and at half the price listed here. Check out Costco first.</li>
    <li> I first got this trio as a free sample and was just amazed when I used it. The shampoo is incredible. It does not leave my hair hard or dry after I wash it out like most other shampoos do to my hair. The conditioner has a very thick texture kind of like lotion and it also just smells soo wonderful!! I just leave it in my hair for about five minutes then I wash it out with cold water and it leaves my hair just smelling so good and soft. The leave in is even better. I air dry my air and I notice that when I use it my hair dries in about two to three hours as opposed to a whole day as it usually did. It also eliminates my frizz a ton!! When my hair is fully dry, my hair is soft and silky with no frizz or damage. It really looks like I just came out of the salon. I recommend this to any one that wants to have soft silky beautiful hair!!</li>
    <li> My hair was damaged, and this brought it back to life. I don&#x27;t know that my hair has ever been this healthy! My hair tends to run on the oily side, but this didn&#x27;t add to that. It is just healthy, strong hair. And it protected my color as well. I don&#x27;t know that I can ever use other hair products now.</li>
    <li> It smells good.... But it makes my hair feel pretty dry and stiff, and I still have split ends. Unfortunately there is no \\&quot;repairing\\&quot; hair... you have to get it trimmed. I dont think I will be buying more of this, I will most likely return to Biologe which smells good, cleans and softens my hair.</li>
    <li> I love these products and bought them here for a great price! I got the order sooner than I expected, so that was a pleasant surprise! I love shopping online, especially on Amazon, so I have some experience waiting on shipments, but I didn&#x27;t have to with this one!&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, I love it! Shampoo and conditioner has lasted me 2 months so far, and I still have a lot left. I can tell that my hair looks healthier and feels so soft. It does make my hair prone to static, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay, because I really can see the difference in my hair. I use the Leave-In treatment every day, but not the shampoo and conditioner, which helped with the static. I would DEF recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have searched high and low for product to bind my split ends. I have extremely long hair (down to my butt) and hate cutting anything off. I also like putting my hair through hell with daily washes, blow dries, and straight iron.  I use tourmaline blow driers and Hani ceramic iron with Chi Iron guard but my poor hair shows signs of stress regardless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I tried the affordable brands (Garnier Nutris &amp; Tresemme ~$5/bottle ) to expensive brands (Federic Fekkai &amp; Bed Head ~$30/bottle) and have found Nexxus Pro Mend to be the ticket. You can feel a huge difference in the first 2 washes. No joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and if you&#x27;re wondering what it smells like... think Vanilla cupcake&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that my hair feels a bit bogged down.. that residue even though it&#x27;s freshly washed. but it&#x27;s nothing a little Fekkai Apple Cider Cleansing Shampoo won&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> This is honestly the best smelling conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. EVERYONE gives me compliments after I use it because they love the way my hair smells. It&#x27;s an extremely good value, too.</li>
    <li> Love it I am going to buy again.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair actually look healthy. I hate cutting my hair because it grows so slowly..now I have a solution.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive my NEXXUS when it finally arrived. It worked for the first 3 days then just suddenly stopped working. It dried my ends out and left me with more dead ends than when I started the treatment.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t mend your split ends. I have always loved using Nexxus products but I guess my gullibility got the best of me, especially coming from a brand that I like.</li>
    <li> This product made my hair feel wonderful in the beginning! I was using the shampoo and conditioner. About a month or more, my scalp was irritated but I didn&#x27;t concern myself with it. After two months if using it, my scalp was so on fire you couldn&#x27;t believe how much it hurt to even lay on a pillow in my scalp. This product does something to your scalp, that I have never had before! It had gone away after using it but my scalp is still sensitive!</li>
    <li> The shampoo leaves my hair feeling like I conditioned it. Very easy to comb through and feels noticeably and visually softer!! The conditioner is amazing. Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling like there is a residual product in your hair!! I&#x27;ve been buying it regularly now, it&#x27;s the one I found that makes my hair better</li>
    <li> Horrible product. It did not work at all. I have more split ends than ever before. Don&#x27;t waste your money. It leaves my hair very greasy.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I&#x27;ve used Nexxus products in the past. The products smell great and leave my hair smoother and more manageable.  Great product, price is the only issue.</li>
    <li> Great product! Love it! Makes my hair so soft and really seems to be helping smooth out my naturally rough hair. You only need a little and it goes a long way! I have long hair so normally I use soo much conditioner, this stuff smells amazing too!</li>
    <li> It came on time and as the picture shows. This is a great product and the only one that is able to clean my hair. I will buy more at a later time.</li>
    <li> Love it! My hair felt amazingly soft and healthy after one use. Would definitely recommend it to all my friends</li>
    <li> So I got this online because there is twice as much shampoo and conditioner as the bottle size available at CVS-- for less than it would cost me to buy it. With the bonus, full size leave in treatment, the value is more than there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pro Mend Shampoo in my opinion is one of the best shampoos on the market. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them too, as a like to take care of my waist length hair with the best. I am convinced that this product is one of the products has has allowed me to grow my hair out so long without breakage. The number of trims I have is significantly decreased, and my ends look better longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, the conditioner, although it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy like a normal conditioner, works like a dream! It both detangles, smooths, and shines. I am very happy.</li>
    <li> So I started using this product when I started perming my hair. It works wonderfully for permed hair. It&#x27;s the only &amp;#34;split end binding&amp;#34;  hair product that I&#x27;ve used and actually  binds split ends!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll often just leave the conditioner in for a day and it makes my hair soooooo soft.&lt;br /&gt;For me, the only con is the smell. I think it smellslike yogurt. heh</li>
    <li> I found this great hair treatment system in a drug store. It&#x27;s the only shampoo conditioner which works on my hair, but its hard to find in stores. Glad Amazon has it.</li>
    <li> The size mentioned in the description was not the size i received. However, I had been waiting for the package and run out of shampoo but i kept it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned the size sent is much smaller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest: I would have never of bought this product, had I not received samples when it had first came out. I strongly dislike how the other Nexxus products made my hair feel the next morning (Greasy as a mess), but the Pro-Mend series is thee best cleansing product for my hair I have ever purchased. It&#x27;s not rocket science to know that the mending is not permanent, and is solely available through the constant use of the system, but while using it I notice that I have extremely touchable, silky, shiny, flowing locks. The aroma is amazing as well; I&#x27;m assuming a vanilla of sorts. My hair currently extends to the middle of my back yet I still only use a nickle-sized drop at most because it lathers up perfectly. Some may be hesitant to purchase \\&quot;salon grade\\&quot; products because of the outrageous prices, but with this purchase in specific, I got double the amount for the same price as the smaller bottles available in stores, on top of the free full-sized leave-in treatment that comes with it as well. I have been using this since it arrived quickly in the mail, with the exception of one shower. I deeply regret using another product; Instant splits viewable with horrible manageability, no luster. You too will know the difference once you&#x27;ve made the switch. If you have long, thick (even damaged) hair, I highly recommend Nexxus Pro-Mend to you.</li>
    <li> Still very satisfied with this company&#x27;s products after several years of use. I&#x27;ve tried others along the way, but this one works for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now and I do think it helps with split ends.  I like the fragrance and the way my ends have improved, but it seems to leave a little residue/makes my hair feel thicker.  I already have thick hair, so the extra thickness isn&#x27;t exactly welcome, but it&#x27;s still a good product and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I got it because of my friend but it didn&#x27;t repair my split ends. I think it works on certain hair types. my hair is very thin &amp; curly, but idk maybe I had a bad batch , the price was awesome &amp; shipping was fast ...</li>
    <li> i use these products and the shampoo and condition are 23 oz. so for me, compares to what i pay in local stores this is a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i haven&#x27;t started using these bottles so assuming this is really nexxus i have liked this formula for my very long hair. hair feels stronger and looks very healthy.</li>
    <li> I love these products!  They leave my hair smooth and shiny.  The Leave-in-Treatment is very therapeutic especially in the dry summer heat.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair feel so soft and keeps the ends together, so less haircuts . I have used it for over 6 months , it is a good product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;I read some of the the reviews which stated many customers received different sizes. I read the description that states 13oz  for the shampoo &amp; conditioner. But I looked at the retail price($59.99) and picture felt the description was wrong. It is sold through amazon directly.&lt;br /&gt;I &amp;#34;assumed&amp;#34;  guess what I am?!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received the item,  I received 13 oz bottles. (02/01/2014)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse, I went shopping at Sam&#x27;s Club (02/03/2014)  3 days after receiving this and they have the same &amp;#34;Kit&amp;#34; but 23oz bottles of shampoo &amp; conditioner &amp; leave in treatment 4.8 oz  for $19.61!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I understand I am paying for a convenience (I am a prime member) but I made a fool out of my self by over paying too much and not doing my home work!&lt;br /&gt;I just wasted my hard earned money!&lt;br /&gt;I guess SAMS CLUB-WALMART have better buying power than Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture and retail price are very deceiving..SHAME ON AMAZON.  THIS SHOULD BE FIXED</li>
    <li> I really like these products. They smell wonderful and I noticed a difference after one washing. The effects are cumulative so after 8 or so washings you will see a marked difference but I did notice a slight difference after just one wash.  I have a little bit of natural wave to my hair and this product has the added bonus of doing a little bit of straightening.  Not a whole lot...  Don&#x27;t expect to have kinky curly hair and it come out straight but my hair does tangle less and hang a bit straighter.  It&#x27;s also not incredibly oily.  There is a little bit of a waxy feel to the hair but it is not bothersome.  I usually wash my hair every other day and I&#x27;ve found with this product I can sometimes go to every 3 days.  That is an added bonus!</li>
    <li> Good product however this not for thin hair or naturally straight hair it will weight it down..it did however work on my daughter who hair type is a Lil thicker and curly</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve used for my hair.  I have cut the split ends off my hair until it&#x27;s all the way up to my shoulders and it&#x27;s still splitting. I only blow dry it every now and then so the ends aren&#x27;t because I over style it. My hair started doing this when I was pregnant, I&#x27;m assuming with the hormone changes. My hair looked like hay at the ends. This set has FIXED my hair!! You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Came faster then i expected. Nexxus ProMend has done its job, it also came with a leave in treatment, all 3 for a GREAT price!!</li>
    <li> This product left my hair feeling completely dry and worse then before I washed it.  I will not be reordering this product and highly recommend that someone else rethink as well.  This is probably the worse product I have ever used on my hair.  It felt like straw after it was blow dried. HORRIBLE.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice an extreme difference to my hair but then again I did not use this on a consistent basis to realize the benefits</li>
    <li> The photo of product shown appears to be for 23 oz size products. The actual products received were only 13.5 oz. The Nexxus Pro-Mend product line is awesome and does work, but it&#x27;s not worth the price for the quantity that was sent. Beware, do not trust photos -- if sizes are not posted in description of product, best to stay away.</li>
    <li> Made my hair split even more.&lt;br /&gt;made my hair really hard and dry so I just returned it. .&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I loce this libe rhey repare your hair, very soon, and have a very good presentation, I really recomend it!!</li>
    <li> I recently bought this shampoo and conditioner and I like it a lot. It made my hair really soft and it smells really good too. I bleach my hair and it really help some of the frizz ad split ends go away. I don&#x27;t really care for the leave in treatment though. I barely even put any in my hair and u can still feel it in ur hair when it dries. It feels and like hairspray and I would have to brush it out. Otherwise good product and the shipping was on time!</li>
    <li> My head is very sensitive and doesn&#x27;t like most of shampoos you can find in stores. Except this one. It washes very delicate, smells beautiful, helps to tske care of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;And, by the way, the price here is veeeery good!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend and I both use this and I have very frizzy hair.  the shea butter in this really helps.  she has straight hair but likes it too.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair and when it gets split ends it looks like hay (especially in the summer). This stuff fixes it right up and smells great as well.</li>
    <li> I had always heard that Nexus had great products so i decided to try these, they leave the hair very soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo and conditioner several times and, frankly, just don&#x27;t buy into the hype that it will rid your hair of split ends.  I read many reviews before making this purchase, and thought I&#x27;d give them the benefit of the doubt, however, that was my mistake.  My hair also has an odd texture after using this combination.  I&#x27;ve since just cut the split ends out of may hair.</li>
    <li> Love the way this smells! although the conditioner is thick it lasts a long time, same with the shampoo. I love this as my not too expensive shampoo/conditioner.</li>
    <li> I had received a sample of this product and loved the way it smelled and how my hair felt after using it, so of course, I immediately came to Amazon for the best priced deal on the shampoo, conditioner, and leave-in split-end mender. If you have poufy, frizzy hair and like a differently scented product, you might like this. (I am not good at describing what it smells like, but it isn&#x27;t a typical overpowering floral shampoo scent. But it is definitely scented, so if you don&#x27;t like scent, you won&#x27;t like this.) The leave-in conditioner is great, but if you use too much, it will weigh your hair down and make it very flat. I found I can&#x27;t use this everyday because it seems to flatten my hair too much, but if I alternate with another shampoo, it is great.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, and the leave in conditioner leaves my hair really soft. But it didn&#x27;t really fix any split ends, but with how soft it made my hair it probably helped more from forming.</li>
    <li> This shampoo, conditioner, and leave in treatment set is huge! It smells really great, and makes my hair feel extremely soft!</li>
    <li> I bought this exact kit in BJ&#x27;s wholesale for 15 dollars because they had it on sell and also had a 5 dollar off coupon. I decided to try it because Nexxus is a great brand and it&#x27;s usually expensive. I have dry hair that breaks easily so it made sense to use this product. The issue to me is that the conditioner doesn&#x27;t really hydrate your hair and the leave in treatment doesn&#x27;t really smooth out my hair. I still get frizzies with it and my ends don&#x27;t look any better. I won&#x27;t be using this brand again.</li>
    <li> When I saw the photo, I expected large size bottles (33.8 FL oz).  However, they (shampoo and conditioner) are 13.5 FL oz.  Plus delivery person rang the bell and I tried to open the door for him right away(my apt is on the 2nd floor) instead of answering the intercom.  By the time I went downstairs in 5 seconds, I couldn&#x27;t see anybody in the door.  I kept looking for the person who rang my bell. I later on saw the box outside.  How can the person be irresponsible?  He/she didn&#x27;t know that the person is inside the apartment or not awaiting the package, but simply dropped the box outside for his/her convenience. It could have been stolen!</li>
