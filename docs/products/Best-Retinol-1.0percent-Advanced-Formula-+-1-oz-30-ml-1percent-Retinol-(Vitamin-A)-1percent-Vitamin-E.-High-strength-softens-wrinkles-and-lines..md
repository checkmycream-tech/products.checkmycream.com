      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Great product leaves my skin soft and even toned!!</li>
      <li>But the immediate result is not as impressive than the vitamin c, the B5 gel or eye serum, but sure it is expected because it helps to reduce wrinkles which is always a life time work.</li>

      <li>After trying so many retinol products over the years with limited results I&#x27;m so happy to have found CSS retinol serum.</li>
      <li>As all Cosmetic Skin Solutions products, this is a nice Retinol formula that is easy to apply and easy to live with - no redness, no break outs.  </li>
      <li>AS MY NIGHT TIME RETINOL CREAM AFTER USING THE VITAMIN 20% C SERUM ADVANCED FORMULA BY COSMETIC SKIN SOLUTIONS.</li>
      <li>Gentle, yet effective.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard great anti aging results which retinol can offer if its used properly.</li>
      <li>I also get a light peel from skinceuticals not anything from this product.</li>
      <li>and so far so good</li>
      <li>I was very excited to try this new Retinol product from Skin Solutions since I&#x27;ve been searching for an OTC Retinol product I can feel confident using.</li>
      <li>So far I am happy with this product, Though I have only used it for 1 month now, I have noticed a more even skin tone.  </li>
      <li>I have always used Vitamin A, it&#x27;s makes a big difference to my skin, quick delivery and good product.</li>
      <li>Comes in an easy to use pump leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft with visibly reduced wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
      <li>The texture of my skin looks more smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>Your products and customer service is wonderful, far exceeds what I had expected!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product because it makes my skin incredibly soft!</li>
      <li>but it is worth ordering again, and trying for another month.  </li>
      <li>It is a worth investment to put on vitamin A on your face.</li>
      <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t seen a lot of difference, but I need to give it more time I&#x27;m told.</li>
      <li>Absolutely worth the price.</li>
      <li>Saw a difference in my skin right away and now that i&#x27;ve been using it for over a month</li>
      <li>I am thrilled over the retinol, the first one I can finally use!</li>
      <li>I noticed a difference after the first night.</li>
      <li>BUT MOST SERUM&#x27;S ONLY COME IN ONE OUNCE SIZE.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>I really see a difference!</li>
      <li>I can only imagine how my skin would look and feel if I had been more consistent.</li>
      <li>pump stopped working after first time.</li>
      <li>To me that proves it isn&#x27;t strong enough to do what it&#x27;s supposed to be doing, which is increase collagen and speed up cell turnover.</li>
      <li>I thought it was 1% pure retinol, but when you read the packaging closely it says it&#x27;s retinyl palmitate, which is the weakest form of retinol and isn&#x27;t really PURE RETINOL.</li>
      <li>I also had some fine lines that are gone now, I don&#x27;t have deep lines</li>
      <li>I RATED THIS PRODUCT VERY HIGH BECAUSE</li>
      <li>Our hot, dry, smoke-filled summer just put this product thru the ultimate test, and the product has come out as an excellent formula for a mature dry</li>
      <li>Thank you so much</li>
      <li>I was hoping it would make my skin peel, since the lable states intense formula, but i never peeled.</li>
      <li>Iv not used this that much yet..</li>
      <li>then when I went back to it, it caused the same issues I&#x27;ve experienced prior.</li>
      <li>My skin looks and feels great - soft, even tone, barely a breakout, and people always think I&#x27;m 10 years younger than I actually am.</li>
      <li>(my other favorite ingredients).</li>
      <li>I love all the other products I got from them,  Vitamin C+E Serum &amp; Resurfacing Serum &amp;Firming  Eye Gel &amp; Hydra B5 Serum...</li>
      <li>I purchased this several months ago and wanted to give it a full go before leaving a review.</li>
      <li>Just ok...not as strong as I expected</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEIR PRODUCTS.</li>
      <li>My dermatologist highly recommends retinol</li>
      <li>I highly recommend adding the retinol product to your skin care routine.</li>
      <li>Also, it is extremely gentle on my overly sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>it makes your skin feel very soft..</li>
      <li>I am still getting comments on how tight my skin looks and I highly doubt I&#x27;ll be going back for more Botox injections anytime soon...  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too early to tell if I have received some benefit from it yet.</li>
      <li>I have cleared up 95% of the redness and bumps and my skin is so soft now.</li>
      <li>I put it on at night and when I wake up in the morning my skin is soft and glowing.</li>
      <li>It will dry your skin out at first.</li>
      <li>It has lightened the dark spot more than 50% so far, and my wrinkles/smile lines are much less noticeable.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this and my skin is not dry, it&#x27;s actually soft and supple.</li>

    <li> Saw a difference in my skin right away and now that i&#x27;ve been using it for over a month my skin is radiant.</li>
    <li> This is the best retinol I have ever tried. I am just in love with the CSS products and all the attention of CSS customer service. My skin is bright and beautiful again. Thank you so much</li>
    <li> Works great and I see results!</li>
    <li> My all time favourite product at CSS. Fine lines gone and skin has never looked more plump and healthier! This is a MUST! I&#x27;ve tried and tested many products over the years and CCS are hands down the best quality products used. I&#x27;m a huge advocate!</li>
    <li> The best anti-aging skin care! a little bit every night and the result is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend the product and Cosmetic Skin Solutions LLC as seller!</li>
    <li> This retinol product is the best! Leaves skin feeling silky, love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this several months ago and wanted to give it a full go before leaving a review. The packaging is nice, but the product just didn&#x27;t work for me. In fact, it clogged my pores and caused  breakouts. I stopped using it for a while then when I went back to it, it caused the same issues I&#x27;ve experienced prior. I&#x27;ve been using retinol products --  both prescription and non-prescription for years now, so my skin is accustomed to it -- so I&#x27;m not sure why this was a dud. Maybe it&#x27;s the fillers? I&#x27;m not sure. Sorry.</li>
    <li> I have only recently started using this and so far I&#x27;m impressed! I&#x27;m using it in addition to the Vitamin C+E Serum (using that every morning and Retinol at night)and I&#x27;m loving the combo.  I noticed a difference after the first night. My skin was softer, and a few days later some bumps I&#x27;ve had on the side of my face seem to be diminishing. I also have not experienced any redness or flaking, like I&#x27;ve had in the past with other skin care lines. I have to admit, I&#x27;m terrible at sticking to skin care routines at night, so I can only imagine how my skin would look and feel if I had been more consistent. I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product because it makes my skin incredibly soft! I have been using it every night for about 2 weeks and I do notice a difference in my skin texture. I will be buying this product again. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd or 3rd bottle of Retinol from Cosmetic Skin Solutions and it won&#x27;t be my last.  I use it every night along with the Resurfacing Serum, and my skin has never looked better.  I am still getting comments on how tight my skin looks and I highly doubt I&#x27;ll be going back for more Botox injections anytime soon...  Along with making fantastic products, their Customer Service is the best I&#x27;ve ever dealt with!!!</li>
    <li> I was worried about retinol due to past experience due to severe skin drying. I&#x27;ve used this and my skin is not dry, it&#x27;s actually soft and supple. My dermatologist highly recommends retinol so I&#x27;ll definitely keep using this product in conduction with vitamin c serum. My skin looks and feels great - soft, even tone, barely a breakout, and people always think I&#x27;m 10 years younger than I actually am. I highly recommend adding the retinol product to your skin care routine.</li>
    <li> Garbage!! pump stopped working after first time. No peeling/burning whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I am using it with my Squalane moisturizer and applying the Retinol product on the age spot, eye crinkles, and nose to mouth creases, then Moisturizer.  It has lightened the dark spot more than 50% so far, and my wrinkles/smile lines are much less noticeable.  I do exfoliate, but have not noticed any extra peeling.  Absolutely worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is the most effective retinol product I have used to date. Also, it is extremely gentle on my overly sensitive skin. I put it on at night and when I wake up in the morning my skin is soft and glowing. I love this product and I think the CSS staff is so helpful and knowledge about their products.</li>
    <li> Not as good as they say</li>
    <li> As all Cosmetic Skin Solutions products, this is a nice Retinol formula that is easy to apply and easy to live with - no redness, no break outs.  I use the CSS&#x27;s Retinol either daily at bed time and/or 4 nights per week with in-between applications of the CSS&#x27;s Resurfacing Serum.&lt;br /&gt;My complexion does not take well harsh Retinol delivery systems (Roc etc) but I have nothing but praise for this product. Our hot, dry, smoke-filled summer just put this product thru the ultimate test, and the product has come out as an excellent formula for a mature dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I must also recommend the way my orders are processed, packaged, shipped and delivered.  The CSS people do their job well in all aspects.</li>
    <li> I used the product as directed and faithfully. I didn&#x27;t see any difference. I do not recommend this product. It does not live up to their promises.</li>
    <li> Gentle, yet effective. I notice my skin looks smoother in the morning.</li>
    <li> After trying so many retinol products over the years with limited results I&#x27;m so happy to have found CSS retinol serum. Comes in an easy to use pump leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft with visibly reduced wrinkles and fine lines. You won&#x27;t find a better retinol product on the market at this price range. Love the safe non-toxic ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have keratosis pilaris on my arms that has gotten worse since entering my 20s now 30s. I have tried a lot and finally after my husband bought this for me, I FINALLY started seeing relief. I have cleared up 95% of the redness and bumps and my skin is so soft now. Its an investment but for this purpose l, this product works wonderfully. Totally recommend! I am on my 3rd bottle now and will continue to invest.</li>
    <li> I really see a difference! love this product.</li>
    <li> I did not notice any difference</li>
    <li> Your skin will feel smoother if you try this. But the immediate result is not as impressive than the vitamin c, the B5 gel or eye serum, but sure it is expected because it helps to reduce wrinkles which is always a life time work. It is a worth investment to put on vitamin A on your face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this serum for four weeks now. I have found that it&#x27;s easy to use. It&#x27;s too early to tell if I have received some benefit from it yet. It does have one draw back and that is that it smells absolutely awful!!</li>
    <li> have only been using it a short while.  So far it does not irritate my skin but no visual changes yet</li>
    <li> I am thrilled over the retinol, the first one I can finally use! Your products and customer service is wonderful, far exceeds what I had expected!</li>
    <li> Just ok...not as strong as I expected</li>
    <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t seen a lot of difference, but I need to give it more time I&#x27;m told.</li>
    <li> Good product. I noticed a difference after a few weeks, but you have to use it 4-5 nights a week and must stay out of the sun when its on. It will dry your skin out at first. I&#x27;d recommend using a lotion with the retinol.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this new Retinol product from Skin Solutions since I&#x27;ve been searching for an OTC Retinol product I can feel confident using. I&#x27;ve heard great anti aging results which retinol can offer if its used properly. I have little to work with such as lines, noticeable pore size, and poor elasticity. I have fair skin, dryness during the seasons, with some spots. I&#x27;ve been using this product in the evening for over 2weeks and have begun noticing improved results such as the softening of lines and reduced pore size. The texture of my skin looks more smooth and soft. I will gracefully do what I can to keep lines from forming. This product has a nice blend of soothing botanicals and vitamin E (my other favorite ingredients). I&#x27;ve got to say, dispensing of the product works beautifully! I can&#x27;t wait for more improved results as I will continue to use this Retinol...</li>
    <li> I was hoping it would make my skin peel, since the lable states intense formula, but i never peeled.</li>
    <li> Iv not used this that much yet..I kept it in the fridge and forgot about it... Its called being 50...SO, Iv only used it for about a week and so far so good it makes your skin feel very soft.. I&#x27;ll keep you posted on results... I love all the other products I got from them,  Vitamin C+E Serum &amp; Resurfacing Serum &amp;Firming  Eye Gel &amp; Hydra B5 Serum... Love all these products.. The people are very nice if you have any questions... Hope this helps...</li>
    <li> I love this retinol.  It is non irritating and leaves my skin smooth.  I love all the products I have tried from Cosmetic Skin Solutions.  Their customer service is great, if you ever need help.  Great product &amp; I recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent cream!! I absolutely love it. I had some sun damage and dark spots from my pregnancies and this cream has cleared about the 80% of it. I also had some fine lines that are gone now, I don&#x27;t have deep lines but I guess it might work just as good.  I use it in my night routine in combination with the phyto serum (also from skin solutions) and a moisturizer. It works wonders, I would not go without it.</li>
    <li> I CHOSE THIS PRODUCT AS MY NIGHT TIME RETINOL CREAM AFTER USING THE VITAMIN 20% C SERUM ADVANCED FORMULA BY COSMETIC SKIN SOLUTIONS. IT &#x27;S NOT TOO HARSH OR DRYING AS SOME OF THE OTHER RETINOL&#x27;S. I HAVE USED.  I WISH THAT COSMETIC SKIN SOLUTIONS WOULD MAKE THIS PRODUCT IN A LARGER SIZE BUT MOST SERUM&#x27;S ONLY COME IN ONE OUNCE SIZE. I RATED THIS PRODUCT VERY HIGH BECAUSE IT WORKS AND I HAVE VERY SENSITIVE DRY SKIN. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEIR PRODUCTS.</li>
    <li> Its not what I expected. I thought after using it for a while my skin would change but all it did was moisturize . I rather go get a good moisturizer</li>
    <li> Just LOVE this product!!!</li>
    <li> I have always used Vitamin A, it&#x27;s makes a big difference to my skin, quick delivery and good product. Would purchase again</li>
    <li> Not helpful at all! Did not see any difference in my skin after a month. Was disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really love this product!  I actually see a difference!It’s improving my skin’s texture without creating blemishes – still a problem at 40-something years of age!</li>
    <li> So far I am happy with this product, Though I have only used it for 1 month now, I have noticed a more even skin tone.  Miracles don&#x27;t happen overnight but it is worth ordering again, and trying for another month.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Great product leaves my skin soft and even toned!!</li>
    <li> This item is nothing like skinceuticals retinol although it seems to be marketed to look like it.  If your shopping around trying to find something cheaper than skinceuticals 1.0 do not choose this product.  It is greasy and clogs pores.  I also get a light peel from skinceuticals not anything from this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this with the CSS CE Ferulic Serum, and I have nothing but good things to say about that product. There is a reason there are so many glowing reviews about it. This product, however, falls short in my opinion. I thought it was 1% pure retinol, but when you read the packaging closely it says it&#x27;s retinyl palmitate, which is the weakest form of retinol and isn&#x27;t really PURE RETINOL. I do find this product to be wonderfully moisturizing, but I wasn&#x27;t looking for a moisturizer; I wanted a true treatment product. In my experience pure retinol products make my skin a bit tingly and irritated when I start using them, and I have never experienced that with this product, even after applying thickly under my eyes. To me that proves it isn&#x27;t strong enough to do what it&#x27;s supposed to be doing, which is increase collagen and speed up cell turnover. I will finish this up by using it under my eyes and see if it improves that area, but for my face I am back to using Retin-A. I do think there are legitimate retinol OTC products that work, such as skinceuticals 1 % retinol, but this product to me isn&#x27;t one of them. Like I said though, their CE Ferulic Serum is AMAZING!! BUY IT AND BE HAPPY &#x3D;)</li>
