    <li> My husband has very very dry skin, he is a lotion addict (as I like to call him) I ordered this lotion after reading good reviews. When it arrived it was smaller than expected (but that is because I did not read the size when I ordered it) it has a very nice scent to it and it feels amazing when applied.</li>

    <li> Best hydrating lotion ever</li>
    <li> I found this at the check out of a natural food store and put some on before leaving the store.  By that afternoon I made a trip to the store to buy some (which they hadn&#x27;t ordered yet - it was a company sample!)  I ordered it on line and have been using it ever since.  I am 61 years old so my arms and hands are starting (correction - not starting, are there!) to get that textured look.  When I put this on it makes everything smooth and soft, including dry elbows and feet, and it stays all day!!  I love the fresh smell and often wear it for the scent, forgoing colonge.  People always say, \\&quot;You smell wonderful!\\&quot;  Recently, I discovered another use.  I have been getting this nasty dry lips that even chapstick doesn&#x27;t help (another age thing??) and so I put some of this on and it kept me moist but not gooey all day.  I am going to order the oil for my hair and just wish they made a night cream.  Meanwhile, I have been using it on my face in place of a moisterizer and it takes 20 years off!    You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this wonderful lotion that contains no chemicals and so many healthy natural ingredients!</li>
    <li> The Seven Wonders Miracr Lotion , is fantastiuc for people who can not tolerate under arm products .  Just use a SMALL amount under your arms and you will not have any more problems . Trust me , I have tried them all.</li>
    <li> It is what all the other product reviews said and more. If you want to get rid of dry skin, this is for you! It has a smell, not a bad one...but it fades after a while, still leaving your skin moisturized. Wow!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t recall where we bought this, but we&#x27;ve had it a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I caught a monster cold. And it made the skin in and around my nose the most raw on the face of the planet.&lt;br /&gt;Neosporin hurt like the dickens. So I got out Seven Wonders and gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;Not only was it the most gentle because of all the oils in it, it has promoted the fastest healing on the severely chapped skin inside my nose and out. And it didn&#x27;t hurt at all to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;If it can heal my chapped nose in a matter of two days, it can do wonders for any dry skin you may have.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. ^_^</li>
    <li> This lotion is to die for, it is luxurious and smells good.  Very moisturizing.  It was delivered ahead of schedule and packaged well.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I love the product it does contain Diazolidinyl Urea as an emollient. I am not allergic to this substance so I am fine with it. I use this product daily and it has done wonders for my skin.</li>
    <li> I have tried drug store and name brand lotions and nothing even compares to this lotion. It keeps my skin moisturized for hours. I dont care for the smell though, nonetheless I will continue to buy this product.     Jackie</li>
    <li> I got this lotion as a gift for Xmas.  I&#x27;m a potions and lotions type of girl, but I&#x27;m really quite picky about it all... this lotion is GREAT.  It smells fabulous and has a great feel -- silky but not slimy.  It really makes my skin soft.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is super awesome! I highly recommend this product! I&#x27;m telling you it works great for a lot of ailments. Try it! Makes your skin feel great. It&#x27;s great for washing your hair also. No kidding!</li>
    <li> product has no moisturizing effect. I had to put baby oil in the bottle for it to have some hydration. Skin was and still felt dry. Smells great as soon as you put it on then smell dissipates in a minute. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I have problems with dry, sensitive skin and try to stick to all natural products.  This lotion not only moisturizes but also seems to help heal my skin.  My children love the smell which is somewhat tropical.</li>
    <li> Although this is a great product, I was better off buying it directly from the manufacturer. First, whomever packed it did not close the top properly and most of my lotion ended up in the plastic bag it was shipped in. I also noticed that the lotion was bothering my eyes, causing me to question it&#x27;s shelf life or if it being in the plastic bag had somehow changed the benefits of the ingredients. I would have rated this with two stars, but I know this is an EXCELLENT product for dry skin...from the manufacturer. I told my sister about it and she is now &amp;#34;hooked&amp;#34; on it. You really don&#x27;t need foundation make-up with this lotion. It gives you a radiant glow!</li>
    <li> great lotion for your feet ad legs.</li>
    <li> Healed the dry hands/cuticles.  Luv it.</li>
    <li> love it. no more dry skin</li>
    <li> This lotion is fantastic!  We bought some at a health food store the 1st time, my husband has worked outside his whole life &amp; his skin is paying the price now. This is the ONLY lotion we have found that does the job. We have finally found the answer.</li>
    <li> I love this product and will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> the wife loves this product!</li>
    <li> This gave my skin back 10 years with just one application. I couldn&#x27;t believe right before my eyes my hands went from old looking to new again. My legs were so dry and I have a large tattoo on my leg. My legs look created and all the colors in my tattoo are vibrant again. I wish I could buy a larger bottle though. I have tried many lotions for my sensitive skin, they all leave me itchy.  NOT this one, I love it</li>
    <li> There may be more than 7 wonders that this cream will provide, but I&#x27;ll list the ones that I know for sure.  1st , is Dry Skin of course, 2ond is Chapped Skin, lips, face, hands, etc., 3rd is Insect Bites, try it, 4th would be sunburn...works wonders, 5th would be burns from hot items or fires, and the best 2 for last, 6th has to be a shear wonder that no one has mentioned, Mussel Aches and Pains, [the best I&#x27;ve tried], #7, and the very best wonder cure and immediate pain relief is, Leg Cramps.  I keep a bottle by my bed, and at night, when a cramp hits, I immediately grab the 7 Wonders Cream, rub some on, and presto, the cramp eases...a wonder at my age of 71.</li>
    <li> I  purchased this item on March 19, 2014. The best purchase ever!!!!  I love, love, love the lotion and the way it smells.  I wish that I could buy a 32 oz. size or purchase by the case.  I had very dry skin until I started using this product, now my skin is baby soft, I am completely hooked.  Thanks Seven Wonders for coming up with this fantastic product!!</li>
    <li> Smells too strong and stay a long time. Actually made me feel a little ill. Won&#x27;t use what I bought</li>
    <li> This is very moisturizing and has a pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  It does not cure my eczema, however, it truly helps.  I have spent a lot on other lotions, not naming any.  It was a waste of money.  I am very satisfied with Seven Wonders Miracle lotion.</li>
    <li> This stuff works amazingly well.  It really does keep the skin well moisturized.  I would call it kind of a miracle how well it has worked on my dry skin and eczema.  My only complaint is the price is a little steep for the quantity.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my elder mom to use. She loves it and I&#x27;ll be buying her more. Thanks for softening her up ha ha.</li>
    <li> This lotion really is a Miracle Lotion.  I have used it for several years and it is wonderful.  It is rich but not heavy, and it has a really clean smell.  It is also good for burning foot pain.  It was recommended by a sales associate at a health food store and now I use it daily.</li>
    <li> More oily than I thought it would be, but the smell is awesome!</li>
    <li> You can get better quality in a good drug store. It wasn&#x27;t horrible, but was not special.  Also has a fruity scent.</li>
    <li> While wearing this lotion, I was once told by a woman that she wanted to have sex with me that I smelled so good. Enough said, I think.</li>
    <li> Received dirty bottle, off-color, chemical scent.  Returned.  Will try new order.  Used this for years and previously LOVED it.  Will update review when receive new order.</li>
