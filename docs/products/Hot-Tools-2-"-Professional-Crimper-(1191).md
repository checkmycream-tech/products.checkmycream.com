      <li>I LOVE IT</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t be sure it was the crimper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought this product several years ago and it still works perfectly!</li>
      <li>but to my surprise it appeared OK.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product to everyone who likes to use Crimper and change their looks: )</li>
      <li>I love this crimper.</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT</li>
      <li>LOVE this crimper.</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>counter top - it won&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>This was a great christmas gift for my 13 year old daughter!  </li>
      <li>The crimping is easy and the hot tool gets hot very quickly and does a great job.</li>
      <li>Oh, and did I mention how easy it is to use?</li>
      <li>One review said it would be easy to burn your scalp, but I don&#x27;t think so, unless you have it on the hottest setting.</li>
      <li>As another reviewer said, the metal plates are not covered on the sides, and so you can easily burn your scalp when crimping close to your head.</li>
      <li>I slept and the crimps still look beautiful the next morning.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure everybody else hates it, because most of my friends and family are giving me that scrunched up face look when I show them my hair.</li>
      <li>I love HOT TOOLS products!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t feel the description accurately described this product.</li>
      <li>has several heat settings, which is great.</li>
      <li>However, I got free amazon shipping and that appears to no longer be an option, so I guess everything evens</li>
      <li>Exciting!</li>
      <li>Love me some hot tools.</li>
      <li>I love hot tools I have over 5 of them.</li>
      <li>Okay, this thing gets SUPER HOT...</li>
      <li>It seemed like such a good product but</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments when I crimp my hair because you don&#x27;t see it around much anymore.  </li>
      <li>And bran new also, heats up good and fast</li>
      <li>Love it, does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do,is designed very well, would order it again!</li>
      <li>it heats up quickly and style stays in till you wash your hair</li>
      <li>Heats quickly</li>
      <li>Heats up quick.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this is a good crimper because you have to hold the crimper on your hair for a long time.  </li>
      <li>It provides a great range of heat settings for everything from fine hair to thick hair.  </li>
      <li>- is there some kind of coating on this crimper that creates the burning smell, and I only THINK it&#x27;s burnt hair?</li>
      <li>it is definately worth the money.  </li>
      <li>worth the money i paid.</li>
      <li>, this is so much fun.</li>
      <li>I followed the instructions and used it on the lowest heat setting, and even though I have medium-thickness hair, I kept the sections thin, and it worked perfectly and didn&#x27;t damage my hair.  </li>
      <li>but I think it was completely worth it.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money of the purchase.</li>
      <li>Like with any heated hair tool use the appropriate protectant products to keep your hair from being burned and don&#x27;t apply heat for too long and you will be fine / achieve the affect you are looking for.</li>
      <li>- this is my first, and it&#x27;s a fun</li>
      <li>the crimper heated up quickly, worked very well on my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>I like it super hot because your hair gets done fast.</li>
      <li>Fast shopping too!</li>
      <li>And of course you&#x27;ll burn your ears - but that&#x27;s if you touch your ears with the hot iron</li>
      <li>The crimes pasted hours and gradually became more subtle, but the iron was very hot and easy to use.</li>
      <li>It has an extra long cord and is easy to use and was easy to manuver in her hair!  </li>
      <li>It crimps absolutely beautifully AND my thin, fine blonde hair doesn&#x27;t seem damaged at all.</li>
      <li>Maybe I was shipped the older Hot Tools model #1191, but regardless, I feel like this seller used a bait and switch method.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect this to stand straight on your bathroom</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;d prefer the style where the whole thing opens and closes like a straightening iron does.</li>
      <li>This is a real crimper, NOT a waver.  </li>
      <li>Crimper works great on my daughters thin hair.</li>
      <li>Also seems very sturdy.</li>
      <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t go for any other crimper.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall this is exactly what I was looking for, and I&#x27;m having tons of fun using it.</li>
      <li>You also DON&#x27;T have to hold it on for a long time like another review said, it is fairly quick!</li>
      <li>Usually I feel it getting warm on my scalp</li>
      <li>After carefully analyzing the reviews i had purchased this item because it said it heats up very quickly...</li>
      <li>heats up quick, be careful of sides of head, they get hot.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to my friends, and I would buy it again in a heartbeat.</li>
      <li>It has different heat temperatures,heats up quickly,and stays hot!</li>
      <li>I bought this model because of the little loop that holds the top and bottom panels together-</li>
      <li>you know lots of ppl say irons burn your hair but if you get a special spray it wont cause split ends or dry and burn your hair .  </li>
      <li>I have VERY thick and long hair and in sections this worked beautifully.</li>
      <li>And now they have the new extended length barrels.</li>
      <li>It will roll onto its side where the hot metal plates are exposed and possibly burn that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I bought this for my 12 year old daughter.</li>
      <li>I bought this to replace an old Conair crimper, and I must say, it met and exceeded my expectations.  </li>
      <li>I love the spacing on the crimps- not to small, not too big.  </li>
      <li>It heats up faster and hotter than my previous one, and it has a dial if you don&#x27;t want it very hot.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> i bought this for my daughter. she loves it though the crimps don&#x27;t last very long. she&#x27;s eight, she&#x27;ll figure out what works as she grows. heats up quick, be careful of sides of head, they get hot. has several heat settings, which is great. worth the money i paid. we&#x27;re happy with it.</li>
    <li> Excellent crimper!  Heats quickly, crimps well.  I love the spacing on the crimps- not to small, not too big.  It provides a great range of heat settings for everything from fine hair to thick hair.  I followed the instructions and used it on the lowest heat setting, and even though I have medium-thickness hair, I kept the sections thin, and it worked perfectly and didn&#x27;t damage my hair.  I bought this to replace an old Conair crimper, and I must say, it met and exceeded my expectations.  I would highly recommend this product to my friends, and I would buy it again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is a good crimper because you have to hold the crimper on your hair for a long time.  My hair is naturally straight and not too thick or thin, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this crimper. It seemed like such a good product but it doesn&#x27;t work like I thought.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this item from Amazon.com because Crimping appears to be in style again. i work in a nightclub setting so i have to keep with with the Trends. After carefully analyzing the reviews i had purchased this item because it said it heats up very quickly...HOWEVER, mine didnt heat up at all. I had to go to the salon and waste my money anyways. I am currently asking for a refund.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT. Ha but I&#x27;m pretty sure everybody else hates it, because most of my friends and family are giving me that scrunched up face look when I show them my hair. It&#x27;s MINI CRIMPS, so it&#x27;s going to look a bit frizzy but you&#x27;ll get tons of volume, for someone like me who has tons of thick hair, yet very flat and boring when straightened, this is so much fun. I was hoping to get a different brand with even tinier crimps, but I wanted this one because I noticed an extra handle that made it easier to squeeze and press the hair hard (my old crimper would really cramp up my hands from trying to squeeze so hard). The knob that allows me to adjust the heat setting is really useful since I have such thick hair, I can get it really hot (I burned my ear today... be careful). However there is a problem when I&#x27;m using it somehow the on/off switch keeps getting pushed back to off but I don&#x27;t notice and it starts to cool off and stops working... gets annoying and often ruins the look on certain sections.  Overall this is exactly what I was looking for, and I&#x27;m having tons of fun using it.</li>
    <li> you know lots of ppl say irons burn your hair but if you get a special spray it wont cause split ends or dry and burn your hair .  i use Ejoy. a hair product. it works good.  than you for your revews  i dont rate this item because i dont have it i just wanted to help ppl with their burnt hair and split ends!  but amaozon is a very good company</li>
    <li> The other reviewers are correct, it does smell suspiciously like burning hair when it&#x27;s on but I don&#x27;t think that it actually burns your hair. Like with any heated hair tool use the appropriate protectant products to keep your hair from being burned and don&#x27;t apply heat for too long and you will be fine / achieve the affect you are looking for.</li>
    <li> The item I was shipped is shaped like a flat iron, only with crimped plates. The handles are completely different than the one in he picture. I bought this model because of the little loop that holds the top and bottom panels together- the model I was shipped does not have this feature. Maybe I was shipped the older Hot Tools model #1191, but regardless, I feel like this seller used a bait and switch method.</li>
    <li> Good crimper for the price. Heats up quick.</li>
    <li> This is a real crimper, NOT a waver.  The crimping is easy and the hot tool gets hot very quickly and does a great job.</li>
    <li> Crimper works great. ...And bran new also, heats up good and fast I had no problems with it at all</li>
    <li> it was awesome worked perfect could not be happier would by again from them . it heats up quickly and style stays in till you wash your hair</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t go for any other crimper.&lt;br /&gt;Hot tools is the only brand you should go with if you want professional results.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased!</li>
    <li> I should have borrowed one before I bought, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to but I misjudged what I was REALLY looking for(deep wave iron) which I did buy and am very happy with.</li>
    <li> I love this crimper. It heats up faster and hotter than my previous one, and it has a dial if you don&#x27;t want it very hot. The crimps are bigger than if you would buy a smaller one, but it is still very noticeably crimped. One review said it would be easy to burn your scalp, but I don&#x27;t think so, unless you have it on the hottest setting. Usually I feel it getting warm on my scalp and I just unclamp it. You also DON&#x27;T have to hold it on for a long time like another review said, it is fairly quick!</li>
    <li> 1. I purchased this a few weeks ago for $27.50. Now I see the price has gone down to $21.50. However, I got free amazon shipping and that appears to no longer be an option, so I guess everything evens out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. As at least one other reviewer said, this does SEEM to burn your hair. In contrast, I use a 3-barrel iron that will blister my skin with one split-second slip, and yet I can leave it in my hair for 45 seconds with no burning smell. It makes me wonder - is there some kind of coating on this crimper that creates the burning smell, and I only THINK it&#x27;s burnt hair? The second time I used it, my hair smelled burnt all day. I was afraid that when I washed the crimps out I would discover that my hair was totally damaged - but to my surprise it appeared OK. I do have some breakage but I can&#x27;t be sure it was the crimper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. As another reviewer said, the metal plates are not covered on the sides, and so you can easily burn your scalp when crimping close to your head. Since the sides of the crimper don&#x27;t actually crimp your hair, why aren&#x27;t they covered in the black protective stuff? I see this as something the manufacturer might want to correct. Which leads me to #4...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Don&#x27;t expect this to stand straight on your bathroom counter top - it won&#x27;t. It will roll onto its side where the hot metal plates are exposed and possibly burn that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. I&#x27;m not real fond of handle, having to push and hold it hard to close the crimper. I think I&#x27;d prefer the style where the whole thing opens and closes like a straightening iron does. This crimper makes my hand/thumb ache after only a short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Despite all the things I would change about this iron, I like the crimps, and I get compliments when I use it. Would I get this crimper again? No. But I&#x27;d still get a crimper - this is my first, and it&#x27;s a fun style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps all crimpers-to-be in the world :)</li>
    <li> Love me some hot tools. Can&#x27;t go wrong! And now they have the new extended length barrels. Exciting!</li>
    <li> Bends a little bc of the cross over instead of a clamp</li>
    <li> I bought this product several years ago and it still works perfectly! I recommend this product to everyone who likes to use Crimper and change their looks: )</li>
    <li> LOVE this crimper. Bought it based on the reviews. It&#x27;s a long, big thing, but you want that so you don&#x27;t have to do tiny 1-inch sections. The ONLY con is that it doesn&#x27;t sit upright, dumb thing. And of course you&#x27;ll burn your ears - but that&#x27;s if you touch your ears with the hot iron (uhm!) It crimps absolutely beautifully AND my thin, fine blonde hair doesn&#x27;t seem damaged at all. I slept and the crimps still look beautiful the next morning.</li>
    <li> Crimper works great on my daughters thin hair. She loves it. The only drawback is that the sides will get hot and the crimper lays on it&#x27;s side when put down on the counter.</li>
    <li> I have VERY thick and long hair and in sections this worked beautifully. The crimes pasted hours and gradually became more subtle, but the iron was very hot and easy to use. I love it and would recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> My tween loved it. She and her friends crimp their hair and giggle about how retro they are. :D Works just like mine did back in the day!</li>
    <li> This is just what i was looking for. it is definately worth the money.  It heats up very fast and it takes very little time to do my hair. my hair comes out just what i wanted. if you are looking for a hair crimper, this is an excellent choice.</li>
    <li> This is a great crimper at a great price! It has different heat temperatures,heats up quickly,and stays hot! Also seems very sturdy. I get so many compliments when I crimp my hair because you don&#x27;t see it around much anymore.  Love the product!</li>
    <li> My 9 year old is obsessed with crimped hair side ponys &amp; braiding every night in small braids was killing me... This item works wonderfully. Fast shopping too!</li>
    <li> I love hot tools I have over 5 of them. As a professional hairstylist I wouldnt buy any other brand.</li>
    <li> Unhappy , I received this product and it was damaged and broken .... Would like an exchange or money back !!!!</li>
    <li> use this 3 times a week and it is the best i have ever bought! I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> I love this crimping iron! It heats well and makes pretty little crimps if you apply enough heat. I had no idea they&#x27;d be so small, though! It doesn&#x27;t burn my hair at all, and I like the way the crimps look in my hair. More expensive than some, but I think it was completely worth it. Oh, and did I mention how easy it is to use? The directions are simple, and it tells what temperature you should have it at depending on hair type. If you&#x27;re thinking about getting a crimping iron, I recommend this one!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 8 &amp; 7 year old daughters as its coming back! The item works great! The crimps last until we wash their hair ! The only issue I have at all is be careful because there&#x27;s no guard and can touch the scalp! But if you&#x27;re careful and pay attention it&#x27;s a wonderful tool!</li>
    <li> The tool makes much smaller crimps. Instead of being wave, it turned my wife&#x27;s hair into a picnic food. Wavy lays anyone?</li>
    <li> the crimper heated up quickly, worked very well on my daughter&#x27;s hair. She still had some crimping the next morning!</li>
    <li> I only got to use the crimper 1 time before it broke so there for I think it was a waste of my money to buy it and no I was not happy with it!</li>
    <li> Okay, this thing gets SUPER HOT... It is adjustable. I like it super hot because your hair gets done fast. And it has pulled my hair a few times, but only when I try to put too much hair between the plates at once.  I love it. It he settings can go high enough for me and low enough for my three year old who loves having &amp;#34;French-fry hair&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Lots of compliments on my hair. Very good product and very easy to use. Well worth the money of the purchase.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t feel the description accurately described this product. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for professionals but I bought this for my 12 year old daughter. The third time she burned herself I bought her a different one. This is very difficult to use.</li>
    <li> I received a straightner instead of a crimper. The straightner was NO GOOD</li>
    <li> It didnt work that well.</li>
    <li> This was a great christmas gift for my 13 year old daughter!  It has an extra long cord and is easy to use and was easy to manuver in her hair!  The crimpling looked good and very pretty, not chunky and never appeared to burn the hair.  The finishing product was beautiful.  I love HOT TOOLS products!</li>
    <li> Love it, does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do,is designed very well, would order it again!</li>
    <li> Item works beautifully and leaves hair nicely styled</li>
