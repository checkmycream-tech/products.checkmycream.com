      <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed using all of the flavors/scents I&#x27;ve tried (which is about half of the options available).</li>

    <li> These lip balms by Hurraw are pretty amazing.  I grew up hooked on Bonne Bell, but the older I got the more they tasted like plastic so I was on the hunt for something better.  And trust me, these Hurraw balms ARE so much better!  They glide on smoothly like butter, last on my lips longer than the cheaper versions, and there&#x27;s so many delicious flavors to choose from.  My favorite flavors are the clove-tasting Chai Spice, the Pitta, and the Night/Moon option.  My least favorites are the other tea flavored ones – they are way too subtle for my liking - and the coffee one because it tasted like fake chocolate Tootsie Rolls or something.  Overall, these balms are superb and I&#x27;m on a mission to own every flavor now!</li>
    <li> My favorite lip balm. I&#x27;m allergic to soy, and it is in most products now. These work better than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried. I love the cherry, it adds a hint of color to my lips.</li>
    <li> Hooray for Hurraw!  My favorite lip balm.  I&#x27;ve enjoyed using all of the flavors/scents I&#x27;ve tried (which is about half of the options available).</li>
    <li> Been using these for a while now; I use them year round.  I just reordered 10 at a time and giving one of them to friend.  Great product, Excellent service from this company, prompt delivery.  Can&#x27;t find anything to complain about if I wanted to.</li>
    <li> The owner is amazing. After purchasing, I failed to include the flavors that I wanted, and she personally contacted me to asked which flavors would I like to be shipped out to me. Besides that kind little gesture, I love love love the product! I love each and every last one of them. Very moisturizing, and not sticky or tacky. I&#x27;ll be purchasing again!!</li>
    <li> The best lip balm ever - I am constantly buying this to gift</li>
    <li> I love these lip balms. They are super moisturizing and smell just as the name indicates. The selection available was wonderful and the shipping was very fast!</li>
    <li> Lots of yummy flavors. First time in years my teen boy hasn&#x27;t had chapped lips. Love that it&#x27;s all organic!</li>
    <li> I love this lip balms ! Except for the green tea one, the smell is not very nice...</li>
    <li> I have tried many lip balms over the years and have found most of them wanting. Either they don&#x27;t stay on very well and don&#x27;t absorb well to moisturize your lips or worse, they get cakey. I was pleasantly surprised when I tried these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They come in a variety of &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; or scents, and my personal favorite is coconut - kind of reminds me of being at the beach when I was a kid. They are all easy to apply and they really moisten your lips and your lips will stay moistened. I use mine alone and over lipstick; note that it doesn&#x27;t seem to smudge any lipstick that is on your lips. For nighttime I use get the black bedtime one and I recommend that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> The scents are lovely and the feel is nice. My two year old loves balms and I feel good about her using this product. The only downside to these balms is the longevity. Frequent application  is necessary .</li>
    <li> I love the grapefruit flavor!  Lemon is good too.  Lime reminds me of lime jello.  Didn&#x27;t care for other flavors so far.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raw. Vegan. Cruelty Free. Organic (what can be). Non-toxic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to their website for ?&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also highly recommend to purchase via www.iHerb.com.</li>
    <li> It won&#x27;t melt in your pocket. It won&#x27;t roll off a counter. It will make you order more ... and more ... and more. I only use Hurraw lip balm now. Another amazing vegan product!</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff ever. I have purchased before and love all the scents. Licorice helps my lips immensely. Glides on smooth and doesn&#x27;t melt. I keep one in my car that has SPF 15 in it.</li>
    <li> This product is great. Smooth, not waxy. And I love the oval shape of the applicator. Plus the vendor was fantastic.</li>
    <li> Love these lip balms!! Cinnamon is my favorite! Just a little color and great flavor. Better than the cherry and I love all things cherry flavored. Vanilla is a little dull, almond is nice.</li>
    <li> Over the years I haven&#x27;t been much of a fan of lip balms. Some of them don&#x27;t apply well. Others cake the lips. And yet others are ineffective or have a bad taste. My opinion changed when I started using the Hurraw! lip balms. These apply smoothly and they provide effective relief for cracked or sore lips and are great protection against the wind and the cold. Moreover, all the lip balms use nothing but organic ingredients and are vegan. I also like the flavors. They&#x27;re all nice, and none of them are overwhelming or obnoxious. Among my favorites are the licorice, the green tea, and the coconut.</li>
    <li> Best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used. Amazing flavors. Vegan. What more is there to ask for? Did find it cheaper some other places, but I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
    <li> I am quite the lip balm addict. I received a sample of this in one of my monthly subscription boxes and immediately fell in love with this product. My first order I sampled six different flavors...man was it hard to choose because there are so many! I quickly found that my two favorites were licorice (because I LOVE black licorice and this has NO calories) and the sun balm. I have a bad habit of misplacing them everywhere so another order was needed. Being a creature of habit and knowing what I like best I reordered my two favorites again. These hold up really well in the heat and don&#x27;t melt with the exception of the one I dropped by the pool at my friends house in Las Vegas when it was well over 100 and laying on concrete directly in the sun for hours..</li>
    <li> Best chapstick in the world! 2nd time ordering this set.  I love the Almond and Green Tea….Black cherry for a healthy tint!  No other chapstick can compare!</li>
    <li> I refuse to use anything else.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the vegans on my shopping list</li>
    <li> Hurraw is amazing.  I will never use another lip balm again.  The flavors and scents are interesting and fun.  These even hold up when I have accidentally put them through the laundry machines (although I certainly don&#x27;t recommend it.)</li>
