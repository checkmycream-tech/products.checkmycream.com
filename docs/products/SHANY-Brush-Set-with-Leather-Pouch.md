<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They are really nice they work they are perfect but some of the brushes hair fall out</li>
    <li> Bought this exact same brush set 3 years ago, still to this day have the brushes and they are still in the best shape(used them almost on a daily basis)  had to Re buy this set! Highly recommended</li>
    <li> These brushes shed like no other and I&#x27;m very disappointed in my purchase. I had purchased these because of good reviews I&#x27;d heard from a few friends and I&#x27;m sad to say that, at least the ones that I received, were not amazing.</li>
    <li> When it comes to beauty products we all know it (or are learing it the hard way): you need to spend money. Brushes are expensive for a reason and that is the quality they are made of. This Shany brush set does not offer any real quality and I ended up having to buy other products that are much more expensive but actually work. Save your money and spend it in more expensive but durable brushes that will actually do professional work. And btw, the black plastic brush holder is honestly made of toxic material, just with the smell you could tell you need to throw it away, fast.</li>
    <li> These are great brushes.  I&#x27;ve had them for 2 years now.  Clean up well.  Durable.  Love the long handle.  Well made.</li>
    <li> These brushes shed and shed and shed ... I have to constantly be taking hair from the brushes off my face or my husband has to point out that I have the hair from the brushes on my face. I washed them and that only made things worse.</li>
    <li> I like the brushes -- the case is a little smelly, it is not leather - but the brushes work for me</li>
    <li> They are really cheap and useful. Just what I needed. I am person learning how to wear makeup for the first time</li>
    <li> Excitedly took the pouch out of the box. Wow. nice condition. Unraveled the pouch..kept unraveling the pouch..so many brushes! I counted them 24 yet it looked like there were more brushes than I&#x27;d ever need. Felt so soft on my skin and models&#x27; skin. I recommend this set to anyone on a budget needing a wide array of tools</li>
    <li> My mom gave me these for my 13th birthday and I love them!! They are soft on  my face and are perfect for everything I need brushes for. The handles have this neat shape (not to defined but I can see it) that fits into my hand perfectly. The leather pouch is amazing for holding, storing, and protecting them, and even comes with two extra spots for your own brushes. For the price this buy was a steal! I absolutely love these brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are BY FAR the best ones I have ever had.   The case they come in is actually LEATHER, and seems to be very high quality. Usually makeup/brush sets come in very cheap packaging that you end up tossing out, but this is one is definitely a keeper.  The brushes are thick, lush, and soft. The handles are long, so application is a breeze.   Definitely the best set of brushes I have ever purchased.</li>
    <li> In spite of the reviews about the bad smell of the brushes, I am so glad I ordered this brush set. The brushes are so soft and the smell just smells a little like leather. This is a great deal for the amount of brushes included. Almost the same quality of MAC, but without the high price. I sure hope they last awhile. I get a lot of compliments on my makeup and now I will highly recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> I bought this makeup brush set for my daughter (teenage).  They are very good quality brushes...and lots of them.  I would recommend this brush set for anyone.</li>
    <li> These are the worst brushes I have ever used in my entire experience. The hairs shed like crazy, they do not blend well at all. I wish I could send them back but they were a gift, so thats too bad. I don&#x27;t recommend these brushes for anyone, they are certainly not worth the price. These brushes are worth 5 dollars at best. I&#x27;m really disappointed in Shany, considering their makeup line is great.</li>
    <li> The brushes were in fact soft but a few were literally falling apart. I washed them before using but there was definitely still shedding. They are made with real animal hair, goat and badger hair they claim, and I wish I paid more attention to that fact before I ordered them but that&#x27;s my fault. There is a distict order but I think it may be the case. If you are looking for really good quality brushes purchase the real techniques brand. Let&#x27;s face it, when you have nothing to compare something to its easy to be overly impressed or overly disappointed. You will not be disappointed with the real techniques brush sets. I bought their gold colored foundation brush and it is hands down the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used. I bought the gold essentials set after because I liked the individual brush that much.</li>
    <li> I just received the Shany Cosmetic pouch today, and let me say it rocks. Its two of my favorite things, hand size and portable. First off, it has 24 brushes that we need for a full face and its natural, not some flimsy brushes you get for $5 at your local dollar store. Second, the pouch is extremely organizable. Finally, each and every brush is protected in its own little section and cover, with a really soft touch and is not made from animals. Over, more people should but this overall great pouch! :)</li>
    <li> This product is a great value and the assortment is fabulous.     Only issue would be that a couple of the brushes had hairs fall out right away. The fix is to just get a pliers and crimp the end down more.</li>
    <li> These are great brushes and they were delivered quicker than I expected however, My #4 Brush came already broken on the bottom. It&#x27;s completely missing a chunk out of it. This makes me sad.....</li>
    <li> My brushes just arrived. Because of the price I had no great expectations. It did come in a nice pouch with the logo on it. It was the same color and product as the one advertised in the photo. The pouch: more like vinyl than leather. I have another brush set from Crown Brush which came in a leather pouch the look feel and smell are different. This is not to down the pouch I actually liked the pouch. I was also pleasantly surprised at the quality of the brushes for the price. I literally took out each brush, touched and pulled on the bristles. There were no stray hairs falling out. The brushes appear to be well made. I am going to wash them and try to use them in the next couple of days and see how well they work. Overall I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I ordered 16 sets of these brushes. They are falling apart after just a few uses.  not worth buying this type of brushes.</li>
    <li> These Shany brushes are a great deal for the price! I love how there are so many different eyeshadow brushes to choose from!  The brushes were a little flatter than expected.  I thought they would be fluffier, but they still are great.  :)</li>
    <li> These are the best brushes I have ever had.  You can&#x27;t beat the price......great value.  The only thing that could be improved on is because there are so many brushes if they had a label on each brush telling you what to use it for would be super!!!!</li>
    <li> The main problem I have with this brush set is that none of the brushes are rounded meaning that the metal part that holds the brush to the handle is flattened which means that all of the brushes are flat.  The bristles are nice and soft and I have not seen any shedding.  There is only one brush that I will not use and that is the fan brush.  It is way too FAT! And has way too many bristles, not whispy at all like a fan brush should be.  Those are my only two complaints about this set.  I would suggest buying another brand unless you are a fan of flat brushes.</li>
    <li> Love this brush set.  I do theatrical makeup normally but I bought this for personal use.  now I am thinking I need a second set for theatre.  great set for a Great price</li>
    <li> These are high quality brushed...great price and nifty pouch to protect them. The service was great. They arrived on time and in great condition.</li>
    <li> The brushes aren&#x27;t the best or worst quality. They&#x27;re easy to clean because they don&#x27;t pick up a lot of pigment, so that&#x27;s a double edged sword. Get them if you&#x27;re looking for cheap back up brushes or if you&#x27;re experiementing with different brush types.</li>
    <li> These brushes are good for studio/professional use. Not for everyday people. I enjoy these brushes, and there is certainly a lot of them. They are good for applying lipstick evenly, and spreading eye shadow thoroughly. I would recommend this product to professional people, but not everyday people, because there is a lot of brushes and different type of brushes.</li>
    <li> Like the brushes but they have a slight problem i have a few that are doubled what i mean is i got the same brushes twice so is like ok. They don&#x27;t shed as much they are really nice i don&#x27;t recommend but if you like doubles brushes is up to you. They came brand new all individually covered, boxed and everything,they smell like new swimming pool i like that lol. i use them with my pallet and they ok .just wish they where a bit better but for the price is worth it .many thanks.</li>
    <li> I purchased these brushes a month ago and they have been but amazing. They are great quality and amazingly priced. I get the best makeup application these as opposed to all the other brushes I&#x27;ve tried. I love how many different brushes you get and the price is unbeatable for the quality. I&#x27;ve recommend these to some friends and they have recently purchased them as well and are in love.</li>
    <li> This is a great bang for your buck. The brushes are really soft &amp; it comes with everything you need. Great for all levels of makeup lovers.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift. The people liked it</li>
    <li> I saw other reviews about the bad chemical smell but it just smells brand new. I think the brushes look and feel great.  I bought this with their &amp;#34;Slick and Shine Lipstick Set&amp;#34; DO NOT buy that lipstick, save your self some money lol</li>
    <li> I loooove this set of brushes! Very nice quality in beautiful packaging. Great for travelling. I HIGHLY recommend this!</li>
    <li> Honestly, for the price I paid for these, I really shouldn&#x27;t complain a whole lot.  They aren&#x27;t the best brushes in the world, and they aren&#x27;t the worst.  What I do like about the brushes are:    1) They look sleek and come in a very cute leather pouch that is black  2) Looking at the brushes, they look very high quality  3) The fan brushes are absolutely adorable  4) Some of the eyeshadow brushes are very useful and there&#x27;s plenty of them in all sizes    What I dont like about these brushes:    1) They are not very dense, which leads them to not be the best quality of brushes  2) I find myself having to remember to reach for these, to make sure I use them.  I wouldn&#x27;t reach for them naturally.  3) I received two of the same exact powder brushes, which are not even very good quality.  They do not pick up color and they don&#x27;t evenly distribute any powder.  4) These brushes shed like crazy.  I washed them before I used them, and then washed them again after using two or three.  I deep conditioned them and they still shed a lot.    After having washed them 5 times now, and making sure I let them sit while they were being deep conditioned, the brushes have finally become a lot softer.  I&#x27;m starting to like them now, but a few of them more than others.  I like a good powder brush and I was really disappointed in the face brushes given in this set.    For a good and inexpensive face brush, I ordered them from Coastal Scents, and will just replace the ones I got in this kit, with those.  Thankfully, I did receive a great pouch to store all my brushes, so even for $35, the pouch alone is worth it.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed :( Didn&#x27;t expect a lot for $25 but there&#x27;s really no variety of shadow brushes :/ If you are makeup artist like I am you know what it means to have good allover shadow brush in your collection as well as blending brush not to mention other brushes... All shadow brushes in this set look more like concealer brushes (you can&#x27;t see on this photo)... They&#x27;re flat and on the top of it poor quality :( I should have save my $25 and add them to purchase a Sigma brushes which in my opinion are one of the best brushes on the market...  Ohh well...</li>
    <li> To start off I recieved these brushes earlier than stated. So that was a great plus! However thats most likely because they ship from Indiana and I live in Chicago but the shipping was great no problems! The arrived in great condition each brush had been in plasic for protection and over the brushes and case was in great condition. I havent used them yet but they are really soft and seem like great quality. The only down side I would say is the pic shows a few different brushes than you recieve. There was no kabuki brush and liquid foundation brushes. There were all 24 but just a few different ones than the pics. I recieved 2 fan brushes one small and one huge. I just wish I had recieved a kabuki brush and foundation brush like it was stated. But other than that the shipping was great the brushes arrived in great condition as well as the case and I am really excited to start using them! THANKS!!</li>
    <li> maybe i expected too much when reading the reviews of this brush set. Most of brushes are shader brushes, there are no blending brush...</li>
    <li> My teen daughter loves this brush set!  Only problems were 2 of the brushes shed easily but the rest of the set was perfect!</li>
    <li> These brushes are so soft and blend my makeup so well. I like the variety of face and eye brushes included. My favorites have to be the fan brushes to brush away eyeshadow fallout. I love the fact that I have so many eyeshadow brushes to choose from. The leather pouch is very luxe and soft. As far as shedding, as long as you wash them like you&#x27;re supposed to, they won&#x27;t shed. Overall, a great investment and value (especially for natural hair brushes!). Shipping was quick and everything was neat and intact.</li>
    <li> the \\&quot;leather case\\&quot; is not leather of course, and it does smell if you put your face into it. But it actually isn&#x27;t as bad as some other reviews claimed.   There was no shedding for my set ( was I lucky??), but a lot of powder if you just brush through the bristles, and there are excess dye on the hair for sure.   Just like clothes, the lower end clothes will not cut the end thread for you, you will have to do it yourself. The brushes are required cleaning and washing in advanced before use.  But once they were cleaned, they are very soft, no shedding, and work great.     I did noticed the unpleasant bristles sensation when I was trying it before wash, but after the cleaning it seems they got softer and so the bristles aren&#x27;t as pokey now.    overall, it is a very good price for the amount and quality of the brushes one get and I especially like the fan brush. it is soft and it does a great job.  would recommend to my friends if they are looking for a cheap brush set.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set for my daughter as a Christmas present.  When she tried them out, they were very coarse and scratchy and the bristles on all the brushes she tried fell apart in clumps.  We were both very disappointed.  The description listed them as studio quality, but they aren&#x27;t.  I am returning this product for a refund now.</li>
    <li> When I first recieved these brushes I thought they were great... Nice selection, came in a nice wrap and looked pretty. Well let me tell you, one month later and they are going in the bin. They shed hair all over my face when applying my make-up, especially the powder and bronzer/blush brushes. Ok, they didnt cost too much in the first place, but you get what you pay for and now I wish I&#x27;d paid a little more for some quality instead of buying this cheap junk... Just a complete waste of money, dont even bother!</li>
    <li> Even though the brushes aren&#x27;t labeled as to which one is what, the quality of the brushes is perfect and I&#x27;m more than satisfied with my buy!</li>
    <li> So i just received my SHANY brush set today, and i was suppose to get it tomorrow, so thats a good thing.   Before i purchased the set, i read most of the reviews and noticed that the ratings were either good or poor. Well i figured people have different opinions, different liking, skin types, etc. so i went ahead and bought it. So today, once i got them, i deep cleaned and conditioned the set.     I checked youtube, to see other peoples ratings on this set. There was one that caught my attention. She stated that after cleaning and conditioning (such as i did) she still wasnt pleased. Her brushes were shedding, it wasnt soft, not did it pick up much product.     After i cleaned them, i put them to use, and i was actually pleased. The brushes were soft, it picked up enough product for my liking, and (SO FAR) theres no shedding at all. So i thought maybe its the type of bristles, hair, whatever they are called. i noticed that in the youtube video, her brushes were black, just like the picture shown, where as the hair/bristles on mine are a brownish red. So i dont know if that can be a contributing factor.    Its still too early to say \\&quot;BUY THIS PRODUCT!\\&quot; but so far so good.      3/22/2011    Its almost been a year, and the brushes are still in good shape... sort of.  There is still no shedding, and by far, the softest face brushes i own. My MAC 187 sheds more than my shany face brushes.  They other small brushes, however, i find useless. i use the majority of them for concealer since none of them are not dense enough to use but for concealer. There was one brush in particular that shed like a dog. it was one of the little ones. Also, the glue in the barrel wore out, so the handle comes off on some.   That&#x27;s basically all thats happened within a year of having them. Nothing major, besides not having a handle, but thats fixable. Id say BUY IT if you want soft brushes. Its a good buy, especially for beginners.</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes with my trial of Amazon Prime 2-day shipping last night expecting to receive it tomorrow the 24th but it came today!! I was skeptical about the quality of the brushes because the price was incredibly cheap for the quantity of brushes included (about $1 per brush)in addition to the leather pouch! I&#x27;m obsessed with make-up products so I&#x27;ve used many popular brands before, and honestly these are a steal for $25! The brushes are very soft and apply eye-shadow very well. These aren&#x27;t the best quality but I&#x27;d definitely love them for the price!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister thinking they would be like those cheap sets, but not at all! We opened them up and I fell in love. They are soft, hold the makeup, and it comes with all the brushes you need. They look nice when you get them and are packaged beautifully. The only concern was the fan brush-it was slightly bent on the hairs because of placement within the set. Definitely recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> These are great brushes for the money!!!  They must be washed before using, they will lose some dye--but better down the drain than on my face!  Super soft brushes, I have not noticed any shedding yet, Im sure they will a little over time.  I have bought expensive brushes in the past that shed first time I used them.  These are awesome brushes -- I will be buying more as gifts!!</li>
    <li> Good brushes at a great price</li>
    <li> I do love these brushes!    BUT WASH THEM BEFORE USING. That, I believe is just COMMON SENSE.     They were good quality and well made, I did not notice any shedding when I washed them. However, I did have to wash them several times before actually using them because the smell was quite overpowering, but otherwise, I loved these brushes. I only wish they came with a shader brush, that was a bit fluffier for blending, but its not impossible on one of the bigger brushes.     I didn&#x27;t really use the bigger brushes, but that&#x27;s because I bought really good quality bigger blush brushes and didn&#x27;t care for the larger ones.    These were great brushes for putting on eye shadow.</li>
    <li> i bought these brushes not to long ago, and i love them, people were saying that, there brushes were shedding and the they wouldn&#x27;t pick up colors, mine are just fine, i have washed them, dried them, and even tried pulling the hairs out and not one hair came out and they are super soft, sorry for those of you why got bad brushes...</li>
    <li> The brushes were exactly as they appeared. They were high quality and had a lovely leather case. They apply and work great with all of my make up. They pack very well and are super easy to travel with.</li>
    <li> When these brushes arrived I was stunned to discover their very high quality.  They are indeed goat and badger hair in a fine case.  Just as it says on the tin, these are as nice as they can be.  If you&#x27;re looking for great quality brushes and don&#x27;t have much to spend, try these, you&#x27;ll be very happy with them.  I&#x27;m delighted.</li>
    <li> This is a great set of brushes at a very reasonable price.  These are great for regular make-up as well as Halloween make-up which is the main reason I bought them.  The quality if very nice, and there are many sizes for all make-up application.  No complaints here.</li>
    <li> Purchased these as a gift and the little lady loves them. After seeing what these sell for at high-end retailers, I can&#x27;t imagine why you wouldn&#x27;t get this set.</li>
    <li> i bought it for a friend of mine and she just loved it.. great buy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these brushes for about two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First- Maintenance. Always wash and moisturize new brushes before they touch your face or your makeup. If you don&#x27;t know how to wash and oil brushes, go to youtube and search for how to care of makeup brushes. When the brushes are mad, they are exposed to all types of chemicals. You have to get that off of the natural hair brushes and get the hair oiled to keep their moisture. They also pick up chemicals when they are packaged, especially in a newly dyed leather case; it will make them stink. So, clean them well, let them dry completely, and they are good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second- Smell. Yes, the case does have a smell. Its from the die. Yes, the case is leather. That horrid stench is from the dyes they have to use to dye the leather. It&#x27;s perfectly normal, and how you get rid of it? DON&#x27;T WASH IT. Take all your brushes out, but them into a safe box and then stick your case out in the dry open air. Give it a few days to just &amp;#34;air out&amp;#34;. Mine was particularly bad, but after a week in the open air, some saddle soap, and a day in the desert sun and a night in the desert cold, the case smells fine now. After a couple months in the house, the smell is completely gone and the leather is supple and strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third- Packaging. It was well packaged and everything arrived in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth- Use. These are excellent brushes, they pick up product well, they hold it fair enough that you wont be leaving a dusting of powder when you use them but they are very easy to clean. Their manufacture is strong and sturdy without being too heavy. They are well balanced so you have good control with them regardless of what you are doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation? These brushes are great for new and experienced users, but I recommend them more for new beginners. They are cheap compared to most good brushes, so if you&#x27;re just starting out in your make-up exploration these brushes are perfect to get you started and they will last you as your master the glories of makeup creativity. If you maintain them, keep them clean, and keep them safe, you should have these brushes for a very long time.</li>
    <li> for the price i received these brushes for they are great.There were 24 brushes which was too much for myself so I was able to share it with my sister and cousin which is great!! I did how ever wash the brushes with shampoo before using which you should do with any other brushes. I got the product in 3 days with amazon prime free shipping.</li>
    <li> Omg brushes feel so soft!! I can say that I did notice a smell imidiatly when ip ever I opened it but let it sit out for a night and every penny will be worth it. It really is goat hair and all the brushes are super soft</li>
    <li> I bought two of these sets as gifts for my sisters. I, myself have not used these sets for makeup application but can give an honest review of my first impression and handling of them.     1. The case of the brush (I, think anyway) makes the brushes smell awful. Like a terrible rubber/ plastic combination and it does not fade. I let the cases and brushes sit outside of the plastic and boxes the products came in to \\&quot;air out\\&quot; and they still stunk. I don&#x27;t want the company killing animals to make real leather cases and jacking their price up, but I am sure they could have used nylon or a water resistant cloth and it would have been a far better alternative.     2. The brushes seemed to be packed with bristles and both sets were pretty identical. Some of the brushes came with their bristles bent (especially the fan brush), and I don&#x27;t know if it was a result of the case or shipping or general packaging and handling.     3. The handles seem fairly sturdy and are all uniform and well painted. The bristles are soft.    4. Some of the brushes seemed to be repeats, but to tell the truth I did not look that closely. Although, some people like to have multiple brushes of the same type, to avoid mixing colors.      5. The kit came out to be ~ $17.00 (I had free shipping) and you get 24 decent brushes. The price per brush beats out even elf brushes which are a dollar each and (I think) that these are better quality than those. HOWEVER, remember that you do get what you pay for. These are not going to be on par with MAC, Clinique, or Sigma brushes, they are generic, \\&quot;made in China\\&quot; brushes with little to separate them from the other low quality brush sets I&#x27;ve seen around.    6. My impression is that they are good for beginners and those who need several eye brushes because they use multiple colors for eye shadows and eye makeup. I cannot speak to how well they pick up color, but they seem decent and will get the job done.      7. I was not pleased that one of the \\&quot;brushes\\&quot; was afoam applicator (which I tend to throw out anyway) and another was basically a mascara wand on a stick (something I could&#x27;ve picked up for free from the Sephora sample/ tester area)     8. I DID like the fact that when the case is opened up, there is a clear flap that goes over the bristle part of the brush, to keep them protected. I also like (besides the smell), the case itself for its convenience and compact, travel friendly, standard design. You can put other brushes that you may already have into some of the spaces.     I will try to update this review after I get feedback from the recipients of this gift and will see how the brushes have held up over time.     Hope this was useful!!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my sister as a Christmas gift. She is incredibly happy with them. (She is also in cosmetology school.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are soft and the case is also soft. She said she sees a lot of girls there with brush sets that are stiff and have hard cases so she is very happy with these. I had read in other reviews that people should shampoo and condition these. It was recommended by her that these should be shampooed with a baby shampoo or other light shampoo. If you condition these, you may want to avoid regular conditioner and buy something meant for these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a great purchase, especially for the price, and we are very satisfied with them.</li>
    <li> This brush set is Awesome!!! The desription of the pouch needs to be edited, or changed. The pouch this brush set came in, is not Leather, &amp; it was not velvet lined. In fact it reecked of vinyl for a couple of days. Do not let that detour you however, as it is a Fabulous brush set! And I would definately recomend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> My husband bought me this off my wish list for Christmas and have it to me early. Wow! What a great set! The brushes are high quality and very soft. The case is great and rolls up into an easy to travel with size. The handels are nice an long. I&#x27;m very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Great brushes. Great price</li>
    <li> I actually read most of the reviews about these brushes on amazon before even considering to purchase them. So i was prepared for all the possible cons and pros about these brushes. hopefully my experience with these brushes will help whomever is considering about purchasing these brushes. to start off, the brushes arrived earlier than the estimated date so this is a plus! I actually bought these brushes with shany&#x27;s 120 makeup palette which i will also review on the other page. anyway, the brushes were packaged nicely and each brush was individually sealed. some people complained that the brush case had an awful smell to do it. mine did have a smell but it wasn&#x27;t as strong as i thought it would be so i was okay with it. the smell sorta faded away after a couple of days and now only has a light scent to it. the case did not make my brush smell or damage any of my brushes at all. i received all of the brushes shown in the pictured- the exact 25 brushes. i absolutely love these brushes simply because they are very soft and apply makeup wonderfully! so far mine has not shed and i had for about a month now and use them everyday. the only downside to it is all of these brushes are made to be used to create hard edges when putting on makeup. I wanted a loose and softer brush so that it will blend my make up better, for instance when you want to blend the crease on your eyes. most of the brushes look more like a smudge brush or concealer brush, like flat looking. I love the fan brush also! however i wished they included a second fan brush that&#x27;s alot thinner so that you can sweep away any unwanted makeup. the fan brush that was provided is alot thicker than your typical/ideal fan brush. overall, i use these brushes everyday and i believe that it&#x27;s a great value! &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> Excelent.The product is to my liking, very good. I love, I am very satisfied. He did not know this brand, and now that I know recommend it.</li>
    <li> So when I was reading the reviews for this brush set I wasn&#x27;t totally convinced that they were good brushes. So I thought about it for a day and I finally ordered them. The shipping told me it would take 4-6 days to arrive, but I found them at my mailbox  3 days later which was really exciting. When I first opened the Leather Pouch that they came in, a really strong smell hit me but I then realized it was the bag. The brushes themselves did have a bad odor, but onceI washed them with shampoo and conditioner they smelled good. They are really soft and pick up makeup really good. One thing that I wasn&#x27;t happy about was that two brushes came broken but all I had to do was glue them with crazy glue!!</li>
    <li> First of all the whole set smells terribly of chemicals. When I inpected the brushed I didn&#x27;t think they look like real animal hair.  I have goat hair brushes I have bought a Sephora - so I know what it is suppose to look like. To be sure I did a simple test. I took a lighter and lit a few fibers on one of the brushes - they melted. Real animal hair will burn and leave ash. Also, it smells like burnt hair not burnt chemicals. Not the real deal.</li>
    <li> Brushes are beautiful and well made! Arrived in a great pouch! Cannot wait to start using!</li>
    <li> I received the makeup brushes this Monday. I was very disappointed when I open the package. I had thought about returning the brushes but decided not to because few of the brushes can use for nails. I take off the first star because I got three brushes that are the same. Take off the second star for two of the brushes hair comes off easily. The others brushes are pretty well hold. And besides the brushes for powder and blush, the smaller ones are very thin and kind of long and not so soft. For example if I use to apply eye shadow, it would be more like a pat on and can&#x27;t be use for blending whatsoever. I prefer my wal mart brushes over these 10x. Also the bag that comes with it smells terribly bad! Maybe it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s not made of real leather. Hope the smells go away in a month or so.</li>
    <li> Very good brushes. I bought to my girlfriend, who loved all. There is some very similar, but a don´t think it´s something negative, considering the value.     Cons: the smell of the package is in deed very strong, but I think it will go away with the time.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the quality of these brushes.  MAKE SURE YOU WASH THE BRUSHES FIRST, lot of dye will wash out with them. Just use plain shampoo.  Overall pretty good!</li>
    <li> Purchased the Coastal Scents 88 matte/shimmer palette and decided to upgrade my tools as well. I&#x27;ve had mine for about a week now, and whenever I show someone they&#x27;re always impressed with what I got for the price. Yeah, the brushes had a brand-new-sorta-chemical smell, but that was quickly mended once I washed them. The case makes for easy transport back and forth between my house and my boyfriend&#x27;s, so for that I&#x27;m greatful. I was a little disappointed in the color of the bristles because they appear lighter in the pictures given, but I can get over it. I&#x27;m really liking them, except I find myself using some of my old brushes as a crutch when it comes to blending. Also, I think the one little sponge tip applicator thingy is an unnecessary add-on, but that&#x27;s just me. As a whole, I&#x27;m happy with them, and would highly recommend them as gifts.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what leather case they were talking about in other reviews, but the smell on the case I got could not be leather at all.  All of the brushes seem synthetic, which is okay, but I do prefer natural brushes. I do love the fact that I was able to add to my collection in one pop for only $25. I really needed a more eye brushes and this set definately has plenty of those.  I&#x27;m washing and conditioning them as we speak, so hopefully they will be a little bit softer that when I opened them.  You definately  HAVE to wash these because the smell from the case is on the brushes. I&#x27;m not a beginer but paying a ton of money on brushes right now isn&#x27;t in the budget so this set will get the job done regardless.  It&#x27;s definately bumped my brush collection up and you really can&#x27;t beat the price!    I WASHED AND CONDITIONED WITH BABY SHAMPOO AND CHEAP SUAVE CONDITIONER.  MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE!  REALLY SOFT AND ACTUALLY FEELS LIKE NATURAL HAIR!  SO I GOT A GREAT DEAL ON THESE BRUSHES!</li>
    <li> These brushes are a great replacement for brushes that tend to be a bit pricier. I recommend these brushes for people who are beginning with makeup and do not want to splurge or spend a lot of money on brushes to begin with. All I do advice is that you wash completely, a deep cleansing, before using with water, vinegar, baking soda, and clothes detergent. This cleaning process can be found on YouTube. Overall very soft, no strange smell and a good deal for you money. I definitely recommend them if you do not want to spend too much money on nicer brushes.</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush set, not expecting much. I just needed some cheap brushes. I was surprised to find an amazing brush set, with almost every type of brush I needed. I&#x27;ve picked up $4 brushes at Walmart that leave my skin irritated and they don&#x27;t get the job done. I&#x27;ve also used MAC brushes, which work wonders but hurt my little wallet. The bristles on these are soft and gentle, not stiff and rough like cheap brushes. And they work just fine! And they come out to 70 cents each, and they are high quality. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking for a decent brush without the cost. Make sure you shampoo the brushes before you use them so you don&#x27;t get dye on you. This is a great brush set for the aspiring beauty queen.</li>
    <li> These brushes are not good at all. They are very rough. The rolling case says MAC as well as the brushes. They are clearly not MAC brushes and I was not expecting them to be so I am not sure why the seller felt the need to misrepresent these brushes. BE AWARE AND STAY AWAY</li>
    <li> My sister loved these quality brushes. She thought I spent a lot more for me. Awesome.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes there are so many to choose from great quality and the case keeps them all together .</li>
    <li> So package arrived super fast! Amazon emailed me telling me I would be arriving it sooner than   expected (versus 4-6 weeks when out of stock) Loved the brushes, very soft and great quality  FOR SUCH A GREAT PRICE!!  Love that it was such a good DEAL!  Would LOVE IF.. they included a blending brush!  And some of the brushes are a little TOO similar..</li>
    <li> I received these brushes a day late, and as I was trying to get registered for college, it took me several days to get around to cleaning and deodorizing my brushes. Well, during the process of cleaning and deodorizing my brushes ONE OF THE HEADS FELL OFF. I was VERY CAREFUL, about not getting the ferrule wet. I&#x27;m a novice at using makeup brushes so I&#x27;m not sure what this particular brush (it&#x27;s the large fan shaped one) is used for, and I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be able to fix it, but the other 23 brushes made it through the process in one piece. I will update my review once I&#x27;ve used them a couple of times to see how they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than one of the brushes falling apart during the cleaning process, I&#x27;m quite impressed with the quality so far. And the value was astonishing.</li>
    <li> Great product,very good buy,there was no shedding of the brushes even during cleaning and no scent on the case.Wonderful product.No regrets with the brushes,love the black carry case.Perfect. Quick and prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> It was the perfect gift.</li>
    <li> The first thing that struck me was the strong smell coming off the \\&quot;leather\\&quot; pouch. It was STRONG. Like getting punched in the nose by a stinky fist. Secondly, not real leather. It&#x27;s not a huge deal to me, as I have a nice makeup box with drawers that I keep my brushes in. If you need the pouch and you want a quality pouch, maybe reconsider, but if you have other means of storage, I wouldn&#x27;t worry about it. To get rid of the smell on the brushes just wash them first. (Squirt a little shampoo in your palm and gently swirl the brushes around in it) When I washed mine last night I lost very few hair, which had been a concern, and this morning they smell much better and are silky smooth. So really, don&#x27;t let the smell dissuade you unless you need this pouch.  The variety of brushes is pretty nice! Lots of shapes and sizes, and I can&#x27;t imagine needing something that isn&#x27;t already here. Probably not for a pro, but great to start or beef up a collection.  The quality seems pretty good too. As I mentioned before, they didn&#x27;t shed very much at all during washing. The handles are nice and long and feel good in your hand. The ferrule (the metal bit that holds the brushes in place) is not remotely loose on any of the brushes. The bristles are soft. They hold pigment pretty well.  Too long, didn&#x27;t read?  SUMMARY:  Smell: Strong, but don&#x27;t let it dissuade you unless you need the pouch.  Variety: Can&#x27;t imagine wanting something that isn&#x27;t here.  Quality: So far so good! Soft and seemingly durable!  Should You Buy?: Yes. Not for a seasoned pro, but great for someone who need to beef up a collection of brushes or start a new one.</li>
    <li> Buenisimooooo...... se los recomiendo a todos los compradores, super puntual y el producto es excelente, tal cual como se describe en la pagina es como te llegara a tu casa,!! los he lavado mas de 5 veces y nunca se les han caido los pelitos, son buenisimo para el uso personal</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m tempted to buy a second set in case something happens to the first set (I tend to lose brushes). I&#x27;m not crazy about the blush brushes. The fan brush is great but I&#x27;m going to use other blush brushes I have for blush application and use the ones they sent for powder only. Love this product though!</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes and of course got them sooner than I was supposed to. I had no shedding whatsoever with these brushes, and they had no problem holding on to my makeup. By far THE BEST brushes I have ever used.</li>
    <li> OBSESSED these are amazing, suuuuuuper soft and the nicest gold and white color. Would buy the brushes over and over agin</li>
    <li> I received these brushes on time and in great condition. For the price, they work extremely well and Im pretty impressed. From reading other customer reviews, I was worried about a few things. Heres what I found:  *Shedding  Let me ask you something. You purchase a brush at a store, and just take it home and use it to apply cosmetics to your face before washing it? Thats disgusting. When I opened the brushes to inspect them, I ran my fingers over them and of course dust came out. I washed each brush and then conditioned them with my normal shampoo and conditioner. Yes, some hairs came out, but not as much as other reviewers are making it seem. Ive been using them for a week and I havent seen any abnormal shedding. Wash the brushes when you get them, and let them dry completely.  *Faux Leather  Im astonished some of the reviewers seemed to be so honestly disgusted with the fake leather case the product comes in. Are you kidding? For 16$ did you reallllllllly think you were going to get real leather? Yes, the pouch has a fake leather smell, but if you let it air out (which you can conveniently do as your brushes are drying after you washed them), its really not that big of a deal.  *Brushes Not Picking Up Product  If you wash/condition the brushes, I bet you&#x27;ll see a difference in how it picks up product.  *Repeat Brushes  I bought these brushes to help achieve more advanced eye makeup looks. At first, yes. Some of the brushes appear to be the same thing. If you know what you&#x27;re doing with them, then you can plainly see they are all different. For some eye shadow looks, you need different thicknesses of brushes for different types of shading. If you dont know what each size/thickness is for, its really easy to use the Google Machine to figure it out. Which brings me to my next point:  *No Guide  Im sure the manufacture is under the impression that if you&#x27;re purchasing a set of brushes like this, you obviously know what they are for, or have a pretty good idea. Again,its super duper easy to Google the brushes and figure it out.  Overall, Im extremely satisfied with this purchase. If you are looking to do some more intermediate/advanced looks, and are just starting out, I would highly recommend this. If you take care of the brushes, they will last a long time. The only reason I left off a star is because I wish it had come with a Stipling Brush and Small Dome Brush. Not that big of a deal, as you can get a pretty good one from ELF for 3$.</li>
    <li> they got the brush&#x27;s to me fast, the case is cute, the 3 big brushs are smaller than i thought they would be, and are a bit stiff. all the other brush&#x27;s are great. you can really do your eyes with these and there soft on the face. i got e.l.f. powder brush and it was so soft on the face, i don&#x27;t know about there other brush&#x27;s. my sister got the shany studio brush&#x27;s with the pink or red handles and loves them. good luck.</li>
    <li> Entrega realizada na data informada.&lt;br /&gt;De excelente qualidade, pincel e suporte para pincel de excelente qualidade.&lt;br /&gt;Recomento a todos que estão pesquisando para comprar.</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes yesterday and recieved them today. They are great for what I payed for them! I can only imagine what I&#x27;d be spending if I bought each of these separately, which is what I had thought about doing.  They have a really great long handle that is easy to hold and comfortable in your hand.  They came to me very very clean and the carrying case is beautiful! It&#x27;s very soft leather and will be GREAT for traveling!! This set is also VERY complete! It comes with every brush a girl could need and then some! It&#x27;s great because you could get it as a starter kit for someone just starting out wearing makeup but you could also get it if you&#x27;re someone, like myself, who&#x27;s been wearing makeup for several years. It&#x27;s just an all around great purchase for what you pay for it!</li>
    <li> I think the brushes are alright.  I did think that for being \\&quot;studio quality\\&quot; they would hold up a little better but right from the get go, the hairs were falling out.  My brushes from Wal-mart held up better.  Plus, for what I paid for them, they could have been shipped a little sooner.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. This is my first time to use make-up brushes of any sort. I just think they are wonderful. They are very soft and easy to take care of. I did what some members recommended and washed them before I used them. I used dreft laundry soap since it&#x27;s the mildest soap of any type in our house. :) And it worked perfectly. I am a very satisfied customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The funny thing is, since I&#x27;ve never used brushes before, I have to do a Yahoo search on what all the brushes were for. Lol. But I figured it out with my internet help and I&#x27;m going to get this down to an art. :)</li>
    <li> These brushes are soft and makes applying make up easier.im not a big make up fan but I do wear it on special occasions so these brushes are perfect for me. Love them and them and the price..</li>
    <li> I love the way this product works with my fun make up days. It has every brush you could possibly need. I must admit they do lose hairs from the larger brushes. If quality could be a bit higher it would perfect. I still would recommend. Nicely priced but would be willing to pay a bit more for stronger hairs in the brushes.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this product because of all the negative commentaries but ended up buying it, the shipping was fast but the product smelled strongly of plastic, but after a good wash and deodorizing the product was amazing (if you do not know how to wash and deodorize search for it on YouTube, always do so when buying new brushes!)</li>
    <li> I gave these a 4 because when I received the brushes I cleaned them first and they were really dirty.  Not sure if that&#x27;s normal or not. These are my first set like this, but I thought it was odd. Other than that I really like them.</li>
    <li> there are alot of brushes in this set, more than i need. the bristles shed all over my face when I put on makeup. i should have just bought a few good quality brushes instead of a million crappy ones!</li>
    <li> i purchased these brushes based on other reviews and have to say i was not pleased when i received them. Im in cosmetology school and these brushes wont even grab the make up. i found it difficult to use them. the brushes were soft, but did not grab the make up. the colors would only apply a very small amount. another problem i found is that they were not assembled well. when i received the set everything was assembled well, however after a couple of days the fan brush disconnected from the handle. i call amazon and they were happy to send me a new one, one-day shipping, and all at no cost! when i received the new ones the eyebrow/mascara brush fell off the handle. overall i would not recommend these brushes at all i was not pleased.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone wanting nice inexpensive makeup brushes! I have been looking for new brushes and they&#x27;re all so expensive. As soon as I found these i read the reviews and thought why not. When i got them opened them up LOVED them. All my roommates and i were going out so i got to test the brushes with everyone!! They&#x27;re great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a make up artist so i don&#x27;t need more than this to apply my make up, some of the brushes shed only a little comparing to the cheaper ones i had before but i can live with that. I did not wanted to use the brushes leather pouch because it had a strong smell and also I love to keep my brushes in a small glass, the leather pouch it&#x27;s not a real leather material, I don&#x27;t recomend this brushes for a professional use, but they are great for personal use...</li>
    <li> Beautiful great soft brushes! THe pouch they come in is sleek and beautiful. The price for the product is unbeatable. Defiantly a good purchase and I am very pleased with the product. An excellent gift idea as well. I will be ordering more for the upcoming holidays. A perfect stocking stuffer!</li>
    <li> Ordered: August 27,2011  Received: September 3, 2011    Okay so I&#x27;m a noob at makeup and the brushes as well, my reasons for buying this was cosmetology school, makeup is a part of this program along with a lot of other stuff, but anyways my sister is mostly going to be doing the actual review of the brushes and how they feel and how they are used, shedding, application all that.    As for me I&#x27;ll talk about how the package came.  I can&#x27;t help but say that I was excited when I saw them arrive on my door step, they were supposes to come on the 2nd , but UPS is at fault for that...can&#x27;t complain I didn&#x27;t pay for shipping.(super save option) and it still came early in my opinion.    It was well packaged; all brushes had been individually wrapped in plastic. The fan brush was the only issue; since the hairs were out of place and sticking out on the sides it also seems kinda...fat (for the lack of a better word).     The brushed didn&#x27;t smell that bad, until I started to clean them then I could smell it a little more. They feel really soft over all; the smaller brushes seem a bit stiff, but my sister pointed out that it was suppose to be like that to pick up the makeup.     They didn&#x27;t come with a foundation brush which I noticed before buying this set, I really think they should think about adding it on it&#x27;s really essential to me because it one of the only brushes I know and use almost every day, (Hey, I do know basic makeup) my sister noted that there weren&#x27;t any blending brushes... (I have a lot to learn).    I think that these brushes will be a good start for me; I&#x27;m not looking for anything expensive right now and these were a great price!    A lot of the reviews were really helpful; someone even compared these to higher priced brushes like M.A.C. so when my sister uses them tonight I really hope she says the same thing. It would be nice to have quality brushes for a low price.   And last but not least the carrying case/pouch; was nice, you get what you pay for whether or not it&#x27;s leather, I care not. It&#x27;s nice and it will keep my brushes organized without me having to go out and buy a case for them so I really appreciate the fact that they added that.     Since this collection didn&#x27;t have the few brushes I needed I kept looking on Amazon and found a 20 piece set by Fash with 2 foundation brushes and blending brushed and some repeats from this one, but that was expected to happen.  Next is the review on my sister&#x27;s makeup application with these brushes. (I&#x27;ll be writing what she says about it.)      So after my sister used the brushes she was actually very impressed and loved the softness of the larger brushes, she ended up using one of the big brushes for foundation and said that it worked really well for her. She found that a lot of the brushes held together well and no shedding occurred.    She really liked one of the brushes in general (concealer brush) and has used them for the past two days happily without any issues.    I guess I would say this just to be safe with my recommendation, since we haven&#x27;t had the brushes long enough to deem them \\&quot;Amazing\\&quot; but their defiantly not low quality.    So in my sister&#x27;s words, \\&quot;I&#x27;ve bought single brushes that cost more at target and they shed all the time, this came with a lot of brushes for a good price and they work really well.\\&quot;    Now as for me I used the brushes once on my own and I like the softness of them on my face. I am just a beginner, but I&#x27;m not blind these brushes were made with care.    Rather than buying one brush for $13 at the store, I would really say to give these brushes a go. I might review again once I&#x27;ve had them long enough, but for now my sister and I are really happy with these brushes.    Defiantly give these a try if you&#x27;re new to makeup or somewhat new!!</li>
    <li> Ok these are GREAT ~  super soft and not cheep looking, I do recommend washing them before you use them</li>
    <li> I received my product within  two business days, it arrived packaged well and was everything that I wanted. Although I&#x27;m pretty sure that I will not use all of the brushes anytime soon. But they are still great to have, and you could not beat the price. Great job!!</li>
    <li> The product came very fast and all the brushes were in good shape. I loved the foundation brush the most!</li>
    <li> I just recieved my brush set and love them all. Quality is great. They are all high quality. I would order them for gifts.</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;leather\\&quot; pouch it states it comes with isn&#x27;t leather its plastic, and it does smell like it. I left it open for a day it aired out, and the pouch doesn&#x27;t have the harsh smell of plastic anymore. Before I began using brushes I shampooed and conditioned the bristles. I have used them for the past two days and the hair of the brushes do not come off. I am very impressed by this product, and definately reccomend the brushes for anyone looking for a great deal.</li>
    <li> my brushes just came so i&#x27;m writing a first review.  they came extremely fast so that was a plus!  as soon as i got them, i practiced on myself and my friend and i was very happy with how these brushes worked.  i didn&#x27;t care about the \\&quot;leather pouch\\&quot; not being leather, considering i paid less than $20 for the set.  the carrying case did not smell terrible; it smells like pleather.  let&#x27;s face it, these brushes won&#x27;t compare to mac, however they work perfect enough for me considering they are less than a dollar a piece.  i was a little disappointed that the set did not come with an eye blending brush, however i can afford to buy one since this whole set was an extremely low price. i would recommend this set for beginners or for people who just love doing makeup. i would also recommend it for any mua who is trying to increase their brush collection. i would definitely shampoo and condition these before using them.</li>
    <li> Its a good product , its met my wife expectations. I am happy for giving my wife this gift thank you very much</li>
    <li> Gr8 Set of brushes, has everything you need. well made and very soft.. The pouch is simple black leather, but nice.. I recommend this Set..</li>
    <li> I knew when I purchased these there were no crease or blending brushes, but I still purchased anyway because they were cheap. So far, I haven&#x27;t had any shedding or odd smells likes other have, and they are very soft. I love the face brushes best. Great if you need a lot of lid or all over brushes, not so great if you need blending brushes. For the price though, I would still buy.</li>
    <li> These makeup brushes are for the most part terrific.  But yesterday the bluser brush handle separated. I was able to glue it back together, but sad that this happened.  I am enjoying them none the less.</li>
    <li> They have a really good price for 24 brushes i just got mine today &amp; they are beautiful! I love them don&#x27;t listen to other reviews they are great brushes &amp; the case is perfect espically if you are a make-up artist. They all roll up into a nice small pouch that is really nice. For what they are, they&#x27;re great!(: BUY BUY BUY!!!!</li>
    <li> I just got my brushes and they look great!  However when I opened them up the smell from the pouch is VERY strong and overwhelming.  I had to put them back in the box and will need to take them out of the pouch and wash each of them.  If the smell was not there upon opening the new brushes, even without use I would have given 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Actually the picture is kind of misleading since the color of the brushes are all black, other than that everything is ok</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. They clean easily, they&#x27;re silky smooth and work great  with the Shany eye shadows. Good bargain!</li>
    <li> The brushes came off a few days after purchased. The quality of the brushes is fine but the glue they used to assemble them doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Perfect for me. It had everything I need when I&#x27;m doing my makeup or asking someone to do it for me. Love it!</li>
    <li> Totally love my brushes. They are easy on the face. Just one thing though, the handles tend to come loose, they un-stick, other than that, good brushes.</li>
    <li> nice set of makeup brushes wife loves them. just wish she would use them more :).</li>
    <li> I loved this product, today will be my third time ordering this. Makes a great gift brushes dont really shed and they apply make up wonderfully. Ive reccomended to many friends.</li>
    <li> I have been doing make-up for forever... these brushed do not fit the bill... the hair is constantly coming out all over my face and yes i&#x27;ve washed them and use a daily brush cleaner. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase them again... I&#x27;d spend more money on a better set of brushed rather then having to go out and buy more if I were you! I mean they have much better affordable sets out there keep looking you&#x27;ll find better I PROMISE!</li>
    <li> Bought these brushes for myself a few months ago &amp; LOVE them. Just ordered another set for my sister for Christmas. Makes an excellent gift &amp; it shipped super quick!</li>
    <li> great value for so many brushes for a starter makeup artist:)lots of brushes in a great case for easy travel</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes. The quality feels good but I felt that many of the eyeshadow brushes are pretty much all very similar. I felt that they were very repetitive. I Would  have liked to have gotten more of a variety. For example there is no fluffy blending brush often used for the crease. But other than that I like how they are.</li>
    <li> This is my first set of make up brushes i&#x27;ve ever owned so I may not be an expert, but I don&#x27;t have a single complaint about this set. When i first got them i did the initial deep clean like other reviewers say to do, and I have loved these brushes ever since. They pick up make up easily and don&#x27;t feel too scratchy, nor too soft for me.</li>
    <li> hei u all, these brushes are sooo good. i luv luv luv em  they don&#x27;t shed. ive had these over a month now and my girl friends have already ordered bunch of em.. they are soo soft and i cant stop playin w em :P i know they are for make up, but its fun playin w em too :P</li>
    <li> I love these brushes little to no shedding. I have purchase brushes from Revlon and they look just like these. I would recommend them the quality is great and i received them fast.</li>
    <li> I got these brushes in the mail today and was surprises of how quickly i recivied them. When i opened my set there was little to no smell. The quality of these brushes are worth more then what i paid for. I just started wearing makeup and this brush set is perfect there are soo many brushes to choose from. i recommend anyone to buy it because your not going to find a set as good as this one for a low price anywhere!</li>
    <li> Got my brushes today, about 6 days after ordering which isn&#x27;t that long considering I am in rural Texas. Right away, I noticed a bit of shedding when I opened the bag. My main concern though was the horrible smell of the black \\&quot;leather\\&quot; bag. My eyes began to water and I started to feel sick from the fumes coming from the bag. I placed the bagged set in my drawer but still could smell the chemical type odor hours later. I tossed the bag in the garbage a a bit ago, and I am letting the brushes air out by an open window. I have begun examining and experimenting with each brush. They seem to work fine so far. I wish they were labeled though. Most of these look the exact same shape but just different hair length and sizes. Still trying to figure out which one of the face brushes is supposed to be the kabuki brush? I must say as far as cheap brushes go, I think I&#x27;ll stick with Eco Tools and Elf.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on all the great reviews.  I am slightly disappointed.  My main gripe with this set is the lack of variety in brushes.  Most all the brushes are in doubles (dark and light color usage).  What you don&#x27;t see in the photos are that they are all of the flat variety types.  There are no brushes in the set that are those thick bushy type great for blending/building color.  I really wished there would have been thick rounded blending brushes, which would make it a more complete set.  I agree with others that the brushes are soft, and pick up color just as well as my other sephora brushes.  The pouch it comes in is very cheap pleather, and the smell is not that overwhelming (nothing that a good cleaning can&#x27;t get rid of).</li>
    <li> I fell in love with them the moment they arrived! So many brushes, and such good quality for such a good price!</li>
    <li> i think these are good and affordable brushes but i wish there was some diff brushes instead of the same but diff sizes</li>
    <li> My daughter and I needed to replace our make-up brushes.  I purchased this set and we split the brushes.  There is a wide variety of brushes!!</li>
    <li> I was unsure about buying brushes online, but did it anyway. The set is a decent set but the hair on most of the brushes started to come out and I had to use pliers to close them to prevent the hair from coming out. If I would have known this I don&#x27;t think I would have bought the item.</li>
    <li> not very goo quality bristles brushes does not cover very well when wet when dry it pick powder ok workable</li>
    <li> It was cheap and you get many brushes for the price, but the bristles fall off and the brushes poke like crazy when trying to apply eyeshadow or contour. Pay a little more for something better quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this and have to admit, the brushes stunk really bad. After washing each brush with baby shampoo and hot water, the smell went away. I love the variety of brushes. I got the stray hairs out when I washed them and they are sturdy brushes, not flimsy. Thinking about ordering it for my friend.</li>
    <li> I got the brushes like three days ago, and I liked them. I mean, they&#x27;re are not pro... (what do you expect for 15 bucks?), but worked pretty well... If you are a professional make up artist, I think should look for something a little more expensive. But for people like me, that are starting in this make up thing, they are really good. Are soft and nice!  The only complaint I have, is that the people of Shany should include like an instruction manual or at least mark every brush, so you can know how to use them. Now I gotta find something on the web so  I can use them properly, cause these 24 brushes are a little overwhelming when you don´t know where to start...:D</li>
    <li> This set offers a really nice selection of brushes. It can be a little difficult to see what kind of brushes you are getting based on the picture, so here is what you can expect: 3 face brushes that can be used for powder, blush or bronzer. They&#x27;re all slightly different sizes, but they&#x27;re pretty similar. You also get a really nice fluffy fan brush. It&#x27;s more like a flattened powder brush since it&#x27;s at least 3 times thicker than a normal fan brush. You also get a very small detail brush that works well for lining lips or for cream/liquid eyeliner. There is also 1 sponge tip brush, which is essentially just the same sponge tip applicators that come with most eyeshadows but on a brush handle. You also get a spool brush for eye brows and a dual ended eyelash brush/comb. The remainder of the brushes are either \\&quot;c\\&quot; eyeshadow brushes or flat top brushes. They&#x27;re all in those 2 shapes, they just come in a variety of sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are all synthetic hair, which is nice for lip products, concealer and for using eyeshadows wet, but you might find that you have some difficulty applying eyeshadows dry. It&#x27;s not impossible, but the brushes tend to create a lot of fall out with dry shadows. I personally got this set to use with pigments and loose mineral shadows (which I apply wet using a makeup setting mist)and they work perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I&#x27;m impressed. It&#x27;s a nice set for the money and even though there are a ton of similar brushes it&#x27;s nice to have some clean backups in my collection. In my opinion it&#x27;s missing some essentials, like a foundation brush and a blending brush - but otherwise you can create a full makeup look using only these brushes.</li>
    <li> Most of these are pretty good, some I did not use. They do tend to shed a lot, especially when being cleaned. Great starter set!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using my brushes!  The price was a steal and the quality is great!  Upon arrival the PLEATHER pouch the brushes came in smells awful LOL!  It also made the brushes stinky but I washedand conditioned each brush thoroughly and now the ouch and the brushed smell like olive oil shampoo &#x3D;).   There are many duplicate brushes but I like that about the set...  My main complain is that there are no any crease/blending brushes which sucks because I like to really blend my eye makeup!  The brissels are smooth and soft and overall I love this set and highly reccommend!</li>
    <li> These brushes are firm but oh so soft. There&#x27;s a great variety of brushes for all your cosmetic needs. Everything came in perfect condition and was wrapped and packed properly. I assumed that I would just throw away the case that it came in because all the reviews I&#x27;ve read for brush sets like this said that they smelled terrible, but mine doesn&#x27;t smell at all. In fact, the case is soft but sturdy and way better than other cases I&#x27;ve had for cosmetic brushes. I would definitely buy this again and I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a great set of brushes.</li>
    <li> I love this shany brush set the best good quality</li>
    <li> These brushes feel luxurious. I&#x27;m so glad I bought these before spending $100+ on a more expensive brand. I feel like I definitely got more than my money&#x27;s worth. I&#x27;ve spent more money on brushes that leave little hairs on your face and these do not do that.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful set- lots of brushes to chose from and if you do not know how or what to use them for they have a diagram labeling each one and what they are for. I use these every day with SHANY cosmetics. Love them all. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Lots of brushes well packaged. Good assortment.</li>
    <li> Great Brushes.....Nice Case</li>
    <li> My FAVORITE! I got these for my birthday and like them better than my Estée Lauder brushes!</li>
    <li> So after reading several reviews, I was pretty stoke about getting my own set as well. The product came in within a week of purchase, when I opened it up to have it ready to be wash before using, I noticed that the Lash comb was partially melted. I was little stunned that they didnt inspect the brushes before shipping it off. Keep in mind that your getting for what you&#x27;ve paid for, and that these are not top of the line brushes. Stick to MAC brushes, if I were you!</li>
    <li> I got these for me and my fellow employees to share and they love them so much.they smell when you first open them but after a couple days the smell goes away.you can try washing them as well.omg.excellent brushes.we are professional cosmetologist and i can tell you these work very well.and we have happy clients</li>
    <li> These shed so much and they&#x27;re the worst brushes I&#x27;ve ever used... DO NOT PURCHASE THESE</li>
    <li> Some little hairs do fall out. Otherwise, great set.</li>
    <li> Great for a beginner. Shed a lot.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have saved a little more money and got better quality brushes.&lt;br /&gt;They are not very soft.&lt;br /&gt;This is a perfect example of quanity over quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was good though. They arrived fast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a semi-pro makeup artist who is on a budget.  This set gives you decent brushes for a fraction of the price of what you would pay for top line brushes, such as Ben Nye.  Yes they are not the top line brushes, but they work wonders when you start working with them!  I&#x27;ve only used the brushes a few times, so I can&#x27;t quite review how long they&#x27;ll last, but my guess would be that they will last long enough to give you plenty of experience, and let you explore what you&#x27;re likes and dislikes are.  The set does not come with a list of types of brushes, you just have to know/learn what they are used for.  I would strongly recommend this set to any student or just out of school grad who is looking to take a step in the right direction!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a little over a month now, I was very excited when I first opened the package. It came in a nice little faux leather pouch, it folds up nicely and keeps the product safe, easy to carry around although when you unwrap it all it&#x27;s not as easily portable. Still the packaging is very nice. I was very pleased at the texture of the brushes and they all work very well. HOWEVER, yesterday I was using the foundation brush and the brush and metal part fell right off of the post. I was able to push it back on and if I need to I should be able to glue it, but after a little under a month this really shouldn&#x27;t be necessary. Still, for the price paid and quality of the bristles this isn&#x27;t a bad buy. Just be prepared for it to fall apart a bit.. carry glue.</li>
    <li> i use them for product styling (clearing dust mostly) i dont think i would use these on my face though.</li>
    <li> I love and enjoy everything about the brush set. It has brushes in where eyeshadows apply easier on the eye. There&#x27;s a good variety of the types of brushes so you can do a lot of things with your makeup. Whether its normal basic wear to night out. Its super..SUPER soft and doesn&#x27;t shed a bit!! totally worth it for the price.</li>
    <li> I found most of the brushes useful.  But, some of them are redundant, because the lip brushes can also be used as eye shadow brushes, and vice versa.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! I was apprehensive at first pricing out different brushes. This set has all the brushes I use, I only have to buy one brush separate from this set. When I got the brushes deep cleaned them and let them out to sit overnight to dry. I have had no issues, they don&#x27;t shed or leave a tint. They are so great!</li>
    <li> just received my brushes  cleaned them and there are still so soft  there great for the price   they arrived a day early which was great since i have a make up session tom and i will be using these brushes   my daughter is a makeup artist and she will be testing them out for me</li>
    <li> Brushes shed like crazy...seems like a lot of the brushes are the same...wasted my money on this product-the brushes were bent as well</li>
    <li> Like the other Shany products I&#x27;ve purchased, I&#x27;m thrilled with these brushes.  I&#x27;d previously been using Estee Lauder&#x27;s, but I thought I&#x27;d give this set a shot.  They are by far superior and a wonderful bargain.</li>
    <li> I opened the package which was wrapped fine, the brushes are great for how much they cost and it has a great variety of what you need. Good product, smells like paint when you first get it though.</li>
    <li> Nice set of brushes for the price. I have not use them yet just got them but the brushes are soft but feel sturdy. If you are a beginner like myself and don&#x27;t plan on using everyday, I think they would do. The only issue like some other reviews stated was the smell frm the pouch which is not leather but vinyl, was very strong. I took the brushes out and let the case air out, I plan on gettng another case anyway an will wash brushes befre use. But, decent brushes. Delivery was fast!!</li>
    <li> Orded these for my daughter, when the arrived and saw the quality of these I ordered a set for myself.  Great value.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet but the quality looks very good and has more than everything I will ever need.   My only complaint is that case which reeks highly of chemicals.  I&#x27;m currently airing out my brushes now to get out that awful smell out.    I will be throwing out the case but keeping the brushes.</li>
    <li> The brushes look and feel great, really easy to clean.  The brushes don&#x27;t hold the makeup that well.  The eye shadow just sorta rolls around on the brush and you have to dip the brush several times just to achieve a light coating of color.  The bigger brushes work great for blush and/or powder and I have even used some of the smaller ones for concealer but they just don&#x27;t do that great on eye shadow.  I haven&#x27;t tried all of the brushes but I guess for the price they are OK.  A good starter set but I would definitely plan on upgrading down the road to brushes that work better, especially if you like to wear eyeshadow a lot.  I don&#x27;t even wear eyeshadow that much and when i do I don&#x27;t like it to be too dark but even I have to dip the brush in the shadow at least 3 times.</li>
    <li> I am a professional female impersonator who uses brushes to death!! These are fantastic!! Great quality - I am amazed at the price. Great packaging....roll them up and go!! I will definately recommend them to all of my friends!!</li>
    <li> Seem nice . I bought these for my wife. She will definitely let me know if they are with it</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re ok for the price, but they need more variety and sizes. The first thing I noticed when I looked at these brushes is that a lot of the brushes look the same, just slightly different sizes and a lot of the brushes bristles were bent out of shape due to the cheap casing.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the smell of the cheap pouch the brushes came in was not too pleasant and also made the brushes themselves smell bad, but a good cleaning should remedy this issue.&lt;br /&gt;Other than all that the brushes are ok for a starter set, which is all I was looking for. They are soft to touch and feel sturdy enough, but in the future I do intend on investing in better higher end brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: 9/25/11&lt;br /&gt;So I cleaned these brushes to get rid of the terrible smell I mentioned earlier and the bigger face brushes are already falling apart and are still bent out of shape horribly. Now I don&#x27;t mean one or two bristles falling off, I mean big chunks of bristles started coming off when I was drying them and no I&#x27;m not rough when drying my brushes. I NEVER had this issue with any of my other face brushes that I was using before I got these and they&#x27;re only cheap Wal Mart/Price Chopper brand brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully the eye brushes held up ok and are still usable, which is the main reason I bought this kit in the first place, but now after seeing this I will definitely be saving up for better quality brushes.</li>
    <li> 1st the case is pleather not leather with a strong odor that affected the brushes as well. Washed brushes odor lessened but still present after drying. Washed a second time and the odor was gone. The brushes did not shed. If you are a novice the brushes are not labeled for their purpose. my focus is eyes and this is what i have identified concealer brush 2 sizes, angled shadow brush 2 sizes, pointed crease brush, blending eye shadow brush, flat eyeliner brush. i suggest you check youtube and compare and label your brushes if you cannot figure them out. that is what i did. i think the fan brush is very thick, very soft not sure how i should use it except to remove product.  Overall quality is good! Remember to dry them on a downward slope so not to ruin the shank and glue.

    <li> The package came open and incomplete , I am so angry!</li>
    <li> I got it earlier than expected! The brushes are fine quality and got a great deal on them.  I would definitely buy from this user again!</li>
    <li> This brushes are so amazing loved them!!!!! Great Price!!!!! and of a really good quality im looking forward to buying more products from shany studio!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought these brushes for my nieces birthday and she was thrilled.  She says they are top quality and even loves the leather travel case they came in.</li>
    <li> these brushes seem to be very well made for the price. the have nice long handles. when i washed mine they bled a little but not bad. the 4 bigest ones also shed some at first.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t complain because of the price. I just need to watch more make up tutorials so I can use them more.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to have a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; brush set and was so very disappointed when I opened the box. First of all, since the description stated that it came in a \\&quot;leather pouch\\&quot;, I fully expected to find a LEATHER POUCH with the lovely smell of leather. Instead I open the packaging and am assaulted with the most horrible chemical smell ever. The pouch is NOT leather but a cheap smelly vinyl. FALSE advertising. Also I find the brushes to be poorly cut and design as well as partially synthetic. I ordered this set thinking I would not have anything synthetic and finding that most of this kit is. I am returning and will not purchase from this company again. Amazon... check them out and make them be truthful in their descriptions.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love these brushes!!! they are great brushes and a really good price!! they work really well and are easy to use!! these are probably the best brushes i&#x27;ve had so far!! i love the case they come with too...real quick and easy to pack up and go.</li>
    <li> I just got these brushes a few days ago, i havent cleaned or conditioned them yet but i did try them on my hand and from what i can see a lot of them dont pick up eye shadow very well, i have a few e.l.f brushes that blow these ones out of the water and they are only $1 each. Im doing to clean them and see if that makes a difference but as of right now im no too happy with them, i was expecting them to be really good from all the reviews but maybe i just got a bad batch, ill let you know how it goes.</li>
    <li> I have only recently gotten really into makeup, as such I used to run with a skeleton crew of brushes.  As I started doing more intricate designs I realized I needed more brushes.  I love the Shany brush set.  The brushes are soft.  I have not had any problem with shedding and they pick up and transfer color well.  I did notice that the fan brush is probably the thickest fan I have ever seen but it doesn&#x27;t really change the quality.    I don&#x27;t know if these brushes are professional quality or not but if you are a hobby makeup artist or just looking for a set of brushes with good quality for a very reasonable price, then these are wonderful.</li>
    <li> These were the first brushes I ever purchased, and they were good, but not great. I would say that if you are looking for brushes that will last a while, go with EcoTools because I&#x27;ve ended up replacing most of the brushes with EcoTool brushes. I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled with the amount of shedding that occurred and a few of the brushes ended up separating from the handles. A few of the brushes are good, but I&#x27;m not super impressed with the set as a whole.</li>
    <li> I received these brushes really quick and they are awesome. I love the selection. I wish there was a cuter case with a different closure but in all a great purchase.</li>
    <li> these brushes are super soft. i love them. they pick up color very well and are very good for their price. the only problem i had was that they shed a little but i mean all brushes do and it wasn&#x27;t enough for me to send them back of regret buying them. also the packaging is super convenient and the bigger brushes have brush guards. it awesome!!!</li>
    <li> I needed some quality brushes without spending a lot of money, so after reading all the reviews I decided to make the purchase.  The brushes aren&#x27;t soft and they shed so much I haven&#x27;t been able to use them.  Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed by how nice these were.  The pouch they are in is super soft leather and the brushes themselves are top quality.  Great price for a very nice product!</li>
    <li> For the price, these deserve five stars. Compared to high end brushes, they&#x27;d be three stars. I wouldn&#x27;t give these as a gift, because they shed a lot, especially the larger brushes. But I would easily recommend buying this set to anyone, even those who have really expensive brushes in their collection. Buy this set for the variety of eye makeup brushes. I use the larger brushes for bronzer (since it can go on everywhere and doesn&#x27;t tend to be over pigmented on skin like blush). In other words, I use the large brushes when applying something that doesn&#x27;t require a lot of definition. I also use them for translucent powder, but hesitate to use them for any powders that can cake, as the brushes may apply too thick in some areas and less coverage in others. The smaller angled brushes are great for creating a natural but defined look with eyebrow powder. Honestly, I use these every day, despite the shedding and often over my more expensive brushes. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great selection of brushes and they really are from natural hair. Only thing i did not like about the product was smell that the case had, something very specific. It took some time until the smell was less disturbing</li>
    <li> First of all, wash your brushes. They have a slight smell, but it goes away. The brushes are incredibly soft, it sucks that they aren&#x27;t labeled but nonetheless for $18.00 it&#x27;s a good starter kit or a kit to just use. I recommend it to people who want to step in and try doing make up, people who like to go out--i don&#x27;t expect these brushes to last forever, and so far i&#x27;m really liking it. On accident I did wash the fan brush with hot water, which started some shedding--but it&#x27;s fine otherwise no other brush shed and i like my set. Next, no one should buy this for the \\&quot;case\\&quot;, it&#x27;s a good carrying case, a nice brush roll to drop in your travel bag, a real space saver overall, but your expectations should be fair not insanely high for $18.00. :)</li>
    <li> Love this, super soft</li>
    <li> she loves this product she uses it all the time its really something she like to do  i would recommend this product</li>
    <li> Today was the first day I used the brushes. They are really nice, but the smell is very strong. I think it is coming from the case. I hope it airs out. My only other issue is I wish the set came with a guide. I am not a professional make-up artist, and it would be nice to know what each brush is for. Once I figure out how to utilize each brush, and the odor subsides I think I will be very happy.</li>
    <li> These brushes are just ok. Im just starting out with makeup so i thought this would be a cheaper alternative to Mac &amp; Sigma brushes. Not so much. They&#x27;re soft but they dont really pick up any product. In the end, i had to buy Ecotools and Sonia Kashuk brushes and both of those work awesome. Some of these brushes are useful like the eyeliner brush, the large brush (even though i dont wear foundation or blush it&#x27;ll come in handy later), and the eyebrow brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  One thing u dont notice about the brushes is that they are the same brush repeated and mabye in a different size. Im sure i have about 3 of the same brush. Not a good investment. I dont even use half of the brushes now.</li>
    <li> These brushes are as good as any. Once I got them, though, I realized ... who really needs this many brushes?! There are about two or three that I use daily. The others sit in the pouch in the drawer.</li>
    <li> Really soft, except for the powder and blush brushes not so soft, amazing complete set with a good pice. I believe it really worths it</li>
    <li> I received my brushes today. They shipped quickly and the packing was great. The quality of the brushes are fantastic. They are soft and very professional looking. I was very impressed when I opened my brushes. I bought 2 sets 1 for my friend and 1 for myself. She love hers also. There is a smell but its not horrible it similar to that of any new item. Not sure how long the smell will last as I&#x27;m writing this review the same day I receive my brushes. The brushes hairs seemed intact (haven&#x27;t used any as yet) but I pulled on ah few but no hairs came out. Overall I Love my brushes and will buy a set again also I will encourage anyone to purchase a set.</li>
    <li> Product was ok. Good variety of brushes but the smell is so bad! Hopefully it goes away soon overtime. A good starter kit for someone new.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;m reading all of the reviews here again...as I did before I purchased the product...and I&#x27;m concerned.  Some folks are saying they recieved a beautiful \\&quot;leather\\&quot; case.  This case is not leather.  It&#x27;s cheap vinyl.  The leather was one of the pros for me when I decided to buy this set.  The item is not as pictured.  All brushes are there but they are more of a red-orange one tone color.  They will definitely need washed as the vinyl case and brushes themselves have a strong odor.  When you open this please do not expect the scent of leather or the exact item pictured.  Maybe the manufacturer needed to cut costs and modified these later?  I purchased based on the reviews so I&#x27;m trying to warn others who do the same.  For $25 bucks they are ok.  Maybe a great starter set for your daughter or neice but definitely not for serious makeup artists.</li>
    <li> I just received these brushes.  I read several of the reviews before I purchased them.  First of all, yes, they are VERY smelly.  However, I think the smell is coming from the pouch they arrive in.  I spent time going over each brush- no hair fell out and they are really soft.  I plan to wash and condition them all tonight before using (as suggested by another review I read).  So- let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s a great selection of brushes for a super great price.  I&#x27;ll try to write a follow-up review after I&#x27;ve used them for a while.     Now let&#x27;s talk about the pouch- the pouch is definitely the culprit for the super stinky smell.  It&#x27;s been painted or varnished or something- that&#x27;s the smell.  The item description says it&#x27;s leather- the jury&#x27;s still out on that.  It&#x27;s soft, but I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s real leather.  And, there&#x27;s no velvet.</li>
    <li> I took into consideration previous reviews and decided to go on and purchase this product. I feel like after reading some of the reviews, the makers inproved their product. A few reviewers complained about the smell and if you&#x27;ve ever owned a leather jacket, then you have an idea of it. For me it was no deal breaker. I cleaned and conditioned my brushes immediately and I have no major complaints. I have experienced no shedding as of yet, there was no serious dye leakage (and I cleaned every single brush), the bristles are silky smooth, not to mention the fact that they now smell like fragrant shampoo. I would recommend this product to everyone who is enthusiasic about make up and perhaps cannot afford to buy each one of the major brushes separately. Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase.    Some things to take into consideration: I think someone noted before that several brushes barely differ in size, so it&#x27;s like having two or even three of the same kind. But I guess you can use one for darker shadows and the other for lighter ones if you so choose. In addition, there is no real liquid foundation brush. HOWEVER, there are three large brushes, and the smallest of the three can be used for this purpose, but bare in mind that it is larger than the typical foundation brush.    *If you do not know where to look to clean/condition your brushes, I looked on youtube, followed EnKoreMakeUp&#x27;s directions and made my own cleaner that worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> Okay, if you have used make-up brush sets before, I&#x27;m sure you have run into the problem of them &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34;. Since the price on this brush set wasn&#x27;t crazy expensive I thought for sure it would be a shedding nightmare. I am happy to report, I was wrong. The large fan brush did lose a few hairs when I first used it, the same goes for the powder and blush brushes. But I shook them out and pulled out the remaining loose hairs and I really haven&#x27;t had an issue since. The smaller brushes have been great and I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding at all with those. The liquid liner brush and the small angled eyeliner brush works incredibly well with Shany Masquerade Eyeliner Gel Color Set. The soft wrap case seems to be good quality as well. It&#x27;s still &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; and I can get kinda rough with cases and things like that, but I have a feeling it will last awhile. Overall I&#x27;m very impressed with this brush set. It&#x27;s an investment that is well worth it.</li>
    <li> Let me just warn you that when you  first open the case the smell is horrible! Maybe because it&#x27;s made out of goat/badger hair, but the vinyl case is pretty cool.I had to let them air out a bit before i cleaned them. First impression the brushes have a very professional look but during/after washing them they shed. At first i thought nothing of it until i used them on my face. More shedding,the eye shadow brush doesn&#x27;t pick up product well,the brushes were too soft ALL OF THEM! Honestly i rather my Elf brushes.</li>
    <li> I purchased these brushes in 2012, and three years later, I still absolutely love them! This was a great investment. The set comes with a wide variety of brushes, ranging from small eye brushes for detailed looks to large fan brushes for powder or highlight. The bristles are naturally soft and can carry a lot of product. As long as you clean them regularly, they can last for a very long time - mine have lasted three years so far! I would repurchase and recommend to anyone, these brushes are fantastic and really helped my makeup look that much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is my cat likes them just as much as I do :)</li>
    <li> no concealer brush, most brushes are the same and the brushes do not adhere to the eyeshadow well.  You get what pay for with this one, my opinion only...</li>
    <li> So i recently purchased and the delivery and all was on time and great.  My only problem is i never got  list of what each brush does and thats the reason i bought the entire set so i could learn each brush and do a change in applying my make up so now i am going to have to do research to figure out what each brush is used for. :/ happy but not fully satisfied.</li>
    <li> I really liked the packaging and the amount of brushes, plenty to work with, however if you are just starting in makeup these will not benefit you due to the brushes not being titled or named/numbered( such as \\&quot;Concealer Brush or Eyeshadow Brush\\&quot;). Big bummer. On the brightside they are soft &amp; easy to use...if you know what brush is needed for what technique. My $10 Elf brush set has each brush and what it&#x27;s use is so I was disappointed but what do you expect for the price. Next time I will buy sigma :)</li>
    <li> I really like the brush set.. the brushes are soft and the pack is great.. of course the only thing I do not know is what brushes is for what lol but I will have my friend assist with that.. amazing product..</li>
    <li> I placed my order for these brushes on February 5, 2012. I placed this order after reading all the reviews. I am so disappointed because today is March 7, 2012 and I still haven&#x27;t  received these brushes. I checked my order and they still have not even been shipped. I really think I&#x27;m about to just cancel this order. It doesn&#x27;t take a month to ship an order.</li>
    <li> ME LIKE THE PRODUCT CAME COMPLETE AND IN VERY GOOD CONDITION. Very useful BRUSHES THE MATTER IS STRONG AND EACH serves a different function.. THANKS</li>
    <li> So, I recently ordered these brushes, and they came way faster than said. I opened the box and immediately fell in love! They are really nice looking, they look as if they are of pretty good quality. I&#x27;ve only used them a small bit so far, and I AM ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE WITH THEM. I&#x27;m about to go order the Shany Natural Fusion eyeshadow palette. Anyways, for only 16 dollars, I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product. I HIGHLY recommend this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I got these for my sister and she loves them!&lt;br /&gt;These are great and inexpensive for starters.</li>
    <li> For the price, these brushes are fine. They are definitely not high quality, but there are a couple of shadow brushes that are dense and work well to apply pigments. They are decent given the price I paid, but I definitely won&#x27;t use all of them.</li>
    <li> I was not aware the the brushes were made of animal hair when i bought them. The set was nice though</li>
    <li> I love this brush set. The brushes are soft and the case is easy to roll up and bring everywhere. My brushes don&#x27;t shed and they don&#x27;t smell weird (I think what people are smelling is the fake leather of the case), and they work beautifully. The only reason that I&#x27;m not giving this set 5 stars is that mine didn&#x27;t come with a blending brush. I had to buy one separately. Still, I highly recommend this set.</li>
    <li> I bought this set 2 months ago.  I only use about 5 or 6 of the brushes (I use the blush, concealer, foundation, mascara spoolie for brows and angled liner brush to fill in brows).  Those brushes do work well.  But when I bought this set, I was in need of some good eyeshadow brushes also.  The eye brushes in this set don&#x27;t work well at all and you could get a better application using q-tips!  One of the eye brushes you get is flat and somewhat tapered (like a small concealer brush).  There&#x27;s 4 of those brushes in varying sizes and the difference between each of them is so minuscule.  There are also 4 blunt cut, square shaped brushes that also have minimal difference in their sizes.  Sometimes I use the smallest one to apply shadow on my lower lash line but you could get the same effect using an angled liner brush.  This set DOES NOT come with a crease, blending or smudge brush!  It really doesn&#x27;t even have a decent all-over-lid brush.  If you are looking for a set with any of those types of brushes, DO NOT buy this one!  I had to go out and buy the Eco Tools 5 piece eye brush set, the Essence of Beauty crease brush duo, and a few ELF eye brushes.  (Those all work great, by the way!) So after spending the $16.95 on this Shany set, I had to spend an additional $20+ on eye brushes.    So bottom line, the brushes that I use from this set, I do like but for the money that I spent, I could&#x27;ve found a quality set that had everything I needed.  I would not recommend buying this product.    PROS:  I have not experienced any shedding with these brushes  Pretty soft bristles    CONS:  Don&#x27;t pick up product very well (especially the \\&quot;eye\\&quot; brushes)  Brushes are not labeled  No decent eyeshadow brushes  Contains too many of the same brushes (could&#x27;ve easily been an 8 or 10 brush set instead of a 24!)  Case is nice but NOT leather as stated in the description (no velvet interior either)</li>
    <li> These brushes are a great value for the price!!! They are really nice brushes, thick not this quality. The only thing i didnt like is that they didnt have written on the brush what each brush is. Other than that I would totally reccomend these!</li>
    <li> WOW! I Was amazed when I get this product! The brushes are high quality items for a low and 100% Reasonable price. I&#x27;m a college student and this package is perfect for going back and forth between school. Definitly worth the price!</li>
    <li> Loved these brushes! They are compact and work like a dream. They are compact enough to take along anywhere and are well made. Would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I found the face brushes of inferior quality, but picked several shadow brushes, and most importantly, the brow brush is amazing! For the price, you can pick and choose your favorites, and ditch the rest. The case is pretty good for travel as well.</li>
    <li> They suck.  They shed so much</li>
    <li> Fell in love with these brushes</li>
    <li> I am a beginner on putting on make up this is good for beginners it gives you a pamphlet on which brush is which. Some reviews said there was shedding I didn&#x27;t experience that yet, that&#x27;s because I haven&#x27;t used all of them yet but the ones I have used didn&#x27;t shed Its a good product for a great price if people don&#x27;t want any shedding maybe they should stop being so cheap and get  a MORE EXPENSIVE NAME BRAND set instead, but me on the other Hand think its a good product so far, I use it almost every  day.</li>
    <li> Ok, I recieved my package this morning. I thought the brushes were a little bigger, the brushes are medium size, not big but not small. When I opened it everything was in there. As soon as you open the box expect a vinyl smell. It wasnt that bad, you would just have to air it out!  The smell should go away by then. All 24 brushes was in the box with a Shany Cosmetic s guide listing all the 24 brushes and thier uses. All the brushes are goat hair.  I iike them!! Its very convenient for me because I am a makeup Artist.  It works for me!</li>
    <li> This was a really good set of brushes for a quick use.  It work well when you are doing basis makeup application in a rush. Nothing for photo shots but in a rush this works great. Enjoy</li>
    <li> Overjoyed with this product! Whatever makeup need you have, this set will cover it! A few brushes seem a bit repetitive but it&#x27;s nice to have 2 that work the same way for styles that require multiple colors or multiple brushes. Don&#x27;t worry about a scent or shedding, just give them a good wash (like you should with any new brush!) before using.</li>
    <li> Update 8/3/2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are still amazing! Can&#x27;t get enough of these I use them all the time! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are so soft and work so well at applying makeup! There are so many brushes and I keep coming back to these over all my other brushes! I&#x27;ll for sure be picking up more of these in the future!</li>
    <li> 24 different brushes for 16 dollars is amazing! its cheap then e.l.f! plus Shany are members of PETA( People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) something I always look for before buying a product!</li>
    <li> My ex loved it.  Keeps me on her good side</li>
    <li> AMAZING PALLET LOVE ALL OF MY BRUSHES, IT  DEF WAS WORTH THE MONEY! Recommended Highly, Enjoy your brushes guys :)</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes as a Christmas gift for my 17-year-old niece.  This looked like a pretty nice set and the description said the brushes come in a leather pouch, which I thought was awesome for the price.  Obviously, I should have known that was too good to be true.  The brushes arrived today and I was eager to inspect them, as I was considering buying a set for myself later on.  The first thing I noticed was the horrible smell that slapped me in the face when I opened the plastic bag they shipped in.  The smell is horrible and strong.  Strong enough that it&#x27;s giving me a headache as I sit here and type this.  Vinyl death.  Not shower curtain vinyl goodness...toxic waste vinyl.  I&#x27;m sure the smell may fade when the brushes are washed but mine was purchased as a gift.  I suppose I should just tell the recipient that maybe the smell will fade after she washes them? The smell is off-putting.    So, I give this product three stars for two reasons:  the misleading product description stating the pouch will be leather and the horrible smell of the vinyl death pouch you actually receive.  I wouldn&#x27;t mind a vinyl pouch as long as it doesn&#x27;t smell like it could be used for chemical warfare.  I&#x27;ve had the pouch out and open to air out.  So far the smell has not faded.    The brushes themselves don&#x27;t appear cheap.  I can&#x27;t say whether or not they&#x27;ll shed or hold product for application.  The larger brushes are a much darker color than what is pictured, but all brushes do appear to have natural bristles.</li>
    <li> Good price to buy when you want to give somebody for gift, that is good deal. for girl, for mom and friends, I think it is best, I never see that how was low price.</li>
    <li> This brushes is very good but have just one problem, the smell is too strong!! I hope the smell getting better!</li>
    <li> These brushes are fabulous, soft, functional, and a bargain.  They allow you to put the shadow, blush, and powder type foundations like a pro!  I will be ordering additional sets for my daughter, daughter in law, daughter&#x27;s mother in law, and several friends.  The brushes come professionally wrapped in a custom leather pouch, and having bought brushes for both art and separately for makeup, I would have expected to pay $300-400 dollars for these brushes, and they are worth every penny at the bargain price Amazon has on them.  Do not wait!  Buy as many sets of brushes as you can for yoursel and for gifts!</li>
    <li> I order this a month ago. A MONTH A GO. I still haven&#x27;t received it. I&#x27;m starting to get very very angry. This isn&#x27;t fair to have to wait a month to get this item. this is crap man.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas present for my friend. When I first got the brushes, it did have a leathery smell but was honestly not that bad. I aired it out for a day and a faint smell remained. Seriously it just smells like leather, if you can&#x27;t handle that than don&#x27;t bother buying leather related stuff in the first place!&lt;br /&gt;However, when cleaning the brushes before use, one of the heads came off and boy was that embarrassing. A little glue fixed it but I still prefer it didn&#x27;t happen to start with.&lt;br /&gt;Besides this, the brushes are actually pretty soft and the amount is enough to make any girl happy. An overall good product minus the adhesive.</li>
    <li> Really good brushes,very affordable, very soft. Would buy as a gift. Easy to clean and the and came in a ok case.</li>
    <li> OMG Regret Why I Have To Buy This Shany Studio Quality Natural! When Are Make-Up With It The Hair From The Brush Will Still On My Face I Have To Remove It! I Hate This Cheap Quality!</li>
    <li> I love the set I was amazed how many brushes were in the leather bag..I love them thank you :-)</li>
    <li> every women should have a great brush set, &amp; this one is it the brushes are soft ,the hairs DONT shed, no hairs on the face or eyes, the handles are sturdy firm wit a good grip to them LOVE the case too.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. They are my first full set of brushes and I use them for everything from blending concealer/camo to lipstick liner.  They&#x27;ve their own place in my train case.  I&#x27;ve not tossed my old brushes but this set fills in the gaps between the other brushes I had quite nicely.  The fan brush is unexpectedly thick and soft for the price.  The case is vinyl, not leather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not experienced the shedding other reviewers discussed.  I did clean them with 1:1 olive oil/anti-bacterial soap as a reviewer suggested and it was perfect!!  The brushes were shiny, full of volume and very little shedding even after vigorously rubbing them in lather to clean them.</li>
    <li> Brushes are great! They smaller ones are nice and firm yet very silky and soft. The large ones are nice and don&#x27;t shed. What a good price, almost half off the Shany site! Came with each brushed wrapped, in the pouch, within a Shany box, then bubble wrap and an Amazon box. Very Happy!</li>
    <li> Happy with the variety. So far they have held up well and are applying my make up well. Im not a make up expert by any means, but I enjoy experimenting with my make up and these brushes have been fun to play with. Great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush set to have an extra set at my salon. Over all they work great came with several different brushes just be careful with them a few of them have came loose and are not connected to the wood handle maybe I can glue it?? But still worth the money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit I don&#x27;t know the first thing about makeup brushes, and what makes them \\&quot;good\\&quot; or \\&quot;not good\\&quot;. They put the makeup on my face; therefore, in my opinion, they are good. The bristles are nice and soft. I read some reviews about the hairs falling out in bunches, but I have had them since October and have had no problems in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of comments said the brushes themselves and the case smell bad, or at least very strong. I did notice the case had an odor to it, but I closed a dryer sheet in there and it was fine. It certainly didn&#x27;t stink up my whole room or anything like that. The case itself isn&#x27;t real leather, it&#x27;s imitation or what might be called \\&quot;vegan-friendly\\&quot; leather. The quality feels very good, not cheap vinyl or plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the brushes smelling funny, I&#x27;ve heard new brushes have that. There&#x27;s a lot of tutorials on how to clean and deodorize them the first time out, which worked nicely. There&#x27;s tons of videos on YouTube, which I found very helpful. I was able to go through and clean all of the brushes in about an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the variety of the brushes, I couldn&#x27;t say. There&#x27;s a lot of them, but I have no idea what most of them are specifically used for. Some I have not used at all. I think with the number of brushes you should be able to find one for what you&#x27;re trying to do. But again, I don&#x27;t know anything about makeup brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this set and I&#x27;m glad I bought it. If you&#x27;re looking for a solid set of makeup brushes of good quality and decent price, I would say these are a good choice.</li>
    <li> There are so many brushes to choose from. Very good brushes, they do not shed. Come with a great case to store all them in. I can not say enough about this product. It is good for personal use and of professional use. Great fine and buy. I have a set for me and I do lot of weddings and also have a set for that. I get asked all the time, \\&quot;were did you get your brushes?\\&quot; I have told and sold a bunch of these set of brushes. I should be getting a check. LOL</li>
    <li> Had these brushes for a long time&lt;br /&gt;beautiful set can&#x27;t beat this for the price&lt;br /&gt;I also have mac and sephora brushes and I still tend to use these more</li>
    <li> I purchased these as a gift for my mom.  They are of wonderful quality considering the price, she still uses them.  These brushes are incredible soft, which is very nice compared to cheaper quality brushes that can be purchased.  While you do lose the occasional bristle, it&#x27;s not near enough to be concerned with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--UPDATE--&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product for my mom in 2011 and these brushes are still in pristine condition.  None of the brush tips have fallen off, as I&#x27;ve seen with cheaper brushes, and there has been no major loss of bristles.  These are very good brushes for the price.  If you need a collection of cheaper brushes at a decent quality, this is the set you should purchase.</li>
    <li> I got it and I&#x27;m pretty happy with what I have. I&#x27;d highly recommend it to those who want it.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush set. I just washed the brushes before I used them and they work great. The leather pouch smells like leather. But no funky smell like I had read on other reviews. The brushes hold eyeshadow pigments very well. This is worth it.</li>
    <li> They are cheap, in price and quality. I wasn&#x27;t expecting &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; for what I paid for them. However, they are just very cheap feeling and they feel gross on my skin. I returned these and spent some more money on several of the &amp;#34;ecoTools&amp;#34; brush sets. Best decision ever, and they are a  much better company (ecofriendly, cruelty free, etc.)</li>
    <li> Our daughter loved this set and was very impressed with the number of different brushed, plus the case was a big plus.</li>
    <li> I can say that this set is really great for people who loves makeup like me its handy and very affordable .&lt;br /&gt;You get a lot of brushes, They are very soft.</li>
    <li> Finally an affordable brush set with all the brushes that I want/need.  The pouch keeps these separate from my other brushes.  Love!</li>
    <li> These brushes are horrible! The shedding is ridiculous, and even after deep conditioning there was simply nothing i could do to save them- the shedding did not stop. One of the powder brushes has lost nearly all of its bristles - Most of them ended up on my face sticking with my foundation! Please please please just buy a studio line elf brush set in stead- SO MUCH BETTER.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing...as are all of SHANY&#x27;s brushes! These are super soft and there is virtually every brush you could ever need/want!! No shedding which is huge when you want good results!!</li>
    <li> Decided that I wanted to purchase this brush set, as well. You can never have too many brushes - right !? Especially at these prices. I must say, Shany Cosmetics has done it again. A stylish brush set that works great and creates beautiful makeup looks for a great price?! This is the product that gets it done! Buy them! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Not the best quality bristles, but they work well with all types of makeup.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!!!!! Super soft and get the job done. Would buy it again and is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Brushes purchased for a niece.. she was so surprised and she says they are so soft.. she is happy to have a variety of brushes inside if just one or two she was using... Lol</li>
    <li> I LOVE THEM!!!&lt;br /&gt;They have variety of models who works for EVERYTHING and they are VERY VERY VERY soft!!!&lt;br /&gt;They have an individual bag that protects them very well...&lt;br /&gt;I REALLY LIKE THEM!!! :D</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used all the brushes yet and probably won&#x27;t because they are either shaped with a straight edge or I don&#x27;t really have a purpose for them.  However, I thought long and hard on buying these because I didn&#x27;t really need 24 makeup brushes, but hell for $17 bucks for a nice cosmetic brand....why not!  I have not had any problems with shedding, smell, roughness.  These are actually soft and precise brushes to say the least.  I&#x27;m impressed with the packaging and how fast I got them.  No complaints from me :-)  To each his own though, you can buy them, try it out and if you&#x27;re not happy....follow the return policy and get reimbursed, but I doubt you&#x27;d do so because again....it&#x27;s great buy for a really nice product.  Especially for beginners like myself.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know much about makeup or brushes at all. So, I got this set as a low price \\&quot;starter\\&quot; set. The smaller eyeshadow brushes are okay. The foundation/powder brushes aren&#x27;t great. The hairs come out as you apply makeup and get little goat or badger hairs all over your face. I wish I just went with a more expensive known brand.</li>
    <li> Soooo ready to do my makeup !</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE these brushes! The quality of the brushes deserve 10 stars. They are so soft and but they do shed (like every other brush) but not alot. Im happy to do my makeup knowing that the products I am using are cruelty free. These brushes will be my all time favorite but I am saving up to purchase the signature collection in the future.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!! The quality is great, they&#x27;ve held up great and I use them ALL. THE. TIME. I wash them all the time, and every single brush has a purpose. I love love love love these. GET THEM</li>
    <li> Some people complained of a smell with their brushes, but I really didn&#x27;t have that issue. I did wash them though, even though they didn&#x27;t smell, as you should with new brushes anyway. The quality on these astounded me for the price. Totally worth it! If you&#x27;re debating buying it, do it! They&#x27;re worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been enjoying using these brushes and have noticed a difference, especially when applying eye make-up.  Looks more professionally applied.</li>
    <li> These brushes are not worth the money at all! They do a horrible job, and don&#x27;t blend the makeup smoothly onto my skin. I was so disappointed when I received them!</li>
    <li> Not the quality that I expected. Brushes are mediocre and oddly shaped. they fall apart. I can&#x27;t use them for painting, much less for make up application. I gave them to my 4 year old niece for water coloring. Shipping was fast though.</li>
    <li> Great deal! Smelly at first but an excellent addition to my kit. Comes with a nice roll up case.</li>
    <li> Bristles aren&#x27;t as soft as expected. The bristles are brittle and break.  Also feels like they are scratching my face especially the foundation and blush brushes.</li>
    <li> I finally got my brushes for my kit. It didn&#x27;t take long to ship, but I&#x27;ve been eyeing this brush set for a while now. The brushes feel awesome. Each brush arrived with a plastic covering in the bottom of the brushes and the brushes also have the protective shape keeping plastic. ( I forgot the name of them). Comes with anicebox and the pouch is nice as well.</li>
    <li> Good starter set but not awesome. Kinda dry rough hairs and most brushes I don&#x27;t even use</li>
    <li> Just got the product and I am excited to use them.  This is my first real set of brushes.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Brushes for every single thing you can think of! Very nice selection and the leather pouch/holder is really nice. It rolls up quite small to fit in luggage, etc.</li>
    <li> They came in perfect condition, they are soft, and grate for the price.. so far so good, please remember to wash them before use them and regularly at least once a week</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what everyone is complaining about, I love the brushes. They hold a good amount of product and work wonderfully! Would I say these are the same quality of a brush you pay $50 probably not but either way they are great and do exactly what they need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It clearly tells you you need to wash them, I did so with Olive Oil and gentle soap then rinsed them in water and didn&#x27;t have a smell afterwards. Yes they do smell a LITTLE when you first get them, remember they are natural animal hair brushes they are going to be treated to keep them in good shape. Just wash them like needed and they&#x27;re perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While you&#x27;re washing them don&#x27;t be afraid to get a little rough with the hairs. Not every hair is going to get caught in the binding just a fact, this doesn&#x27;t mean they are poorly made just facts. You show me where a machine catches every single hair of a make-up brush with out them being fixed or pulled out, I know you can&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see where some people complain about the fan brush getting bent when you fold the case back up; HOWEVER this is because they aren&#x27;t taking their time. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with the hairs getting bent on mine at all. I&#x27;m careful to take my time and NOT just throw the case together. All you have to do is PAY ATTENTION.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will happily buy this set again when it is time to. Honestly I&#x27;m thinking about buying a few more sets just so I have them. I highly recommend getting these!!</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;m just a regular woman with regular cosmetic needs and these brushes do the trick. They run the range from little to huge. I like the guide that describes their uses, too.</li>
    <li> Sucks.. Case was not leather. False advertisement.. Brushes smelled really bad has to wash several of times.  I guess you get what you pay..</li>
    <li> The natural brushes are super soft and have not shed a single hair yet. The only bad thing I can say is that the selection is so huge, I had to go do a &#x27;brush-up&#x27; on what the purpose of each brush is!</li>
    <li> brushes are not hard i  would say medium not quite soft. it is shedding  a bit and a few of the bigger brushes have popped of. i am going to re glue it and hope for the best. its ok  i guess.</li>
    <li> Really love these brushes. I use them all the time and they stay in perfect form with continued use and cleaning.</li>
    <li> The bursh kit is really nice but I wish they labeled what kind of brush it is rather than the number. I&#x27;m a novice to make up but I figured that it would be good for the professional. Not really needed for the beginner for someone who doesn&#x27;t apply makeup that often</li>
    <li> This was absolutely amazing. The hairs were so soft and didn&#x27;t shed, except for the really big fan-looking one. But I don&#x27;t know what that&#x27;s for anyways so I don&#x27;t use it. It comes with an instruction page for all the brushes and what they&#x27;re for, because half of them I have no idea what to do with. These are so great and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Nice rollup case provided for these. Lots of brushes for the price and the quality is pretty decent. Haven&#x27;t used them a ton yet, but bristles are staying in so far.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my mother in law and she loves them. Every girl can always use new makeup brushes. The real leather case was so soft. Remember to always wash your makeup brushes before using. They seem to be very well made.</li>
    <li> I gave it 3 stars because the first brush I pulled out of the case (brush #4) had come unglued from the handle.  I didn&#x27;t return it though since I had E6000 glue on hand and didn&#x27;t mind fixing it.  However, please triple wash the brushes before use!  I have a little green saucer that I place a drop of cleanser on and I swish my brushes around the saucer and I noticed that the lather was grey not white.  I think it is because of the dye used on the face brushes.  So I washed each face brush until I got a bright white lather.  The eye brushes I have not washed yet but when I was inspecting one of them I flicked a brush against my finger to feel if the bristles were soft and a fine white powder spewed from the brush!  No clue what it was but I&#x27;m still alive so it&#x27;s not anything homeland security needs to be aware of.  Just make sure to triple wash the brushes!  So far though, the face brushes I have used are very soft, I like it better than the Sonja Kashuk brushes I bought from Target.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have professional make-up experience but it sure looks like it when I pull this out in front of my friends and family. My sister uses a lot of expensive brushes and she actually thinks some of these work better than her MAC ones. Some brushes are useless but overall I am super pleased with this buy as my starter brush kit.</li>
    <li> I gifted this brush set to a family member of mine who is very much into cosmetology.  She loves the set and works absolute magic with them.  She&#x27;s given me countless &amp;#34;makeovers&amp;#34; and every time i&#x27;m impressed with her work... The brushes are easy on the skin and allows her to achieve any look she wants.</li>
    <li> A majority of these 5 star reviews are obviously phony. I purchased this set due to the multitude of 5 star reviews comparing these brushes to MAC brushes. Once received, I came back to Amazon to re-read the reviews and after checking out the other &amp;#34;reviewers&amp;#34;, ecspecially the ones comparing the product to MAC, I realized they were obviously fake.  These are cheap brushes, you are paying exactly what they are worth, not a penny more. You are not getting some great bargain as the many reviews indicate.  Providing my opinion as I rely on truthful opinions when I purchase items from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! They were everything I expected. I would recommend these brushes, they are supper soft and actually grab the makeup!</li>
    <li> These brushes are make up artist quality brushes. I was highly impressed when I received these in the mail. Would recommend to others most definitely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making a superb product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EGagne</li>
    <li> My wife was very happy to have these natural Bristle brushes for make up for work. The price was great and similar to the expensive brands.</li>
    <li> I am still wondering if the people that claim that these brushes are just like the ones from Sephora have ever used a Sephora brush, because the brushes I received have nothing to do with them! Don&#x27;t get me wrong, for the price you get a very nice leatherette case, for which I would gladly have paid $10-$12, and a lot of brushes, but they are low quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not experience the strong odor other people claim. I cleaned my brushes with the Sephora cleaning spray, which caused some of them to lose some of the color, and then I let them dry. They are quite soft, but the length of the hair in each brush is not uniform, so if you are looking for a very precise work they won&#x27;t cut it. In addition, after a couple of weeks using them, a few of mine have starting losing hair very noticeably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that I would like to highlight is that not all the brushes have the same color. The smaller brushes have an orandge-ish color, and the larger ones are black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, good set for the price, but I don&#x27;t anticipate them lasting more than a few months!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for a gift- the price is very reasonable for the amount of brushes that you receive.  I was disheartened upon opening it that the pouch smelled of vinyl and is not leather at all.  It is a pleather type vinyl.  It does smell plastic like when you first open it so I recommend washing and conditioning all of the brushes.  Only thing that would also make this a perfect 5 is if there was a large foundation/bronze brush included.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these brushes. In fact, I ordered a set for my Mom because I love them so much. They come with a little booklet letting you know what each brush is for. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> For their price, these brushes are alright. But as I use them, the bristles come off onto my face (especially the poweder foundation one), which is annoying. But they&#x27;re not bad!</li>
    <li> Nice according to my niece.  do not fall off easily.  good as the expensive ones!  This is their second order actually</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for these brushes, but I am SO impressed! I&#x27;ve been looking to get an extra set to bring up to our vacation home, and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on them since we&#x27;re only up there a few months out of the year. The quality of these brushes are SO nice! I am pleasantly surprised. They aren&#x27;t my Sigma or my MAC brushes, but they are definitely a good quality. The only smell mine had were from the &amp;#34;leather&amp;#34; pouch (which is not genuine leather, but still a great quality) and they are really soft. They feel nice as well, the handles and the tops are heavy and don&#x27;t feel cheap. If you&#x27;re hesitating over these, go for it! I love them!</li>
    <li> Great item offered on Amazon, very happy to have it, hair doesnt fall off and I can select my brushes to put in my purse based on my needs. would recommend, everyone should have, instead of paying $50 for one brush in sephora, I can have them all with $35, Im actually very happy, will tell all my friends about this.</li>
    <li> This was a great deal! 24 brushes for 25$! My set didn&#x27;t have much shedding. However it was very gross when I wash them for the first time. The case is so nice. The brushes themselves are hit and miss. Some don&#x27;t pick up product well. There are 9 brushes that are the extact same yet ever so remote different sizes. This is a great deal nonetheless and would highly recommend it for first timers as well someone who wants a nice brush case, or a complete set of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main problem is the brushes aren&#x27;t numbered. Nor did they come with a guide to show which brushes are used for what.</li>
    <li> they are dicent quality for the price i guess</li>
    <li> have had this for a long time about 4 years at least. I don&#x27;t use all the brush but I use most every day since getting them. the bristles don&#x27;t fall out even after washing. BUT some brushes that I use frequently the plastic part that holds onto the wood has fallen off, (its most likely because I have had them a long time and the glue is dried out) but its an easy fix just glue done the plastic back to the wooden stick.  some of the brushes in this set look the same as others just in different sizes. still love them and its better than most super expensive brands these brushes do the exact same thing</li>
    <li> I am glad I purchased this set. They are soft and easy to clean and the brushes are labeled. Very good purchase for the price!</li>
    <li> absolutely love it! These are the best brushes ever!</li>
    <li> Ok brushes for the price. The ones I use for my blush do shed and I have to wipe them off my face after applying.</li>
    <li> I used it for about half yr, and washed it for few times. It works perfect and soft. Worth buying it.</li>
    <li> These brushes are beautiful and soft brushes making it easy to work with. they are easy to shampoo and condition and no colouring comes out.</li>
    <li> The odor of this set of brushes is unacceptable.  Smells like gasoline and vinyl . Certainly don&#x27;t want to use these on my face. Would gave them NO stars but I can&#x27;t . Returned item</li>
    <li> The sleeve it&#x27;s not of a super good quality, but it works... and the brushes, they was just what I needed</li>
    <li> made a nice Christmas gift, the brushes were okay for the price, there are better brushes,  but they are more expensive</li>
    <li> Excellent quality especially for the price. Usually can buy one brush for the price, but found a lot in the bunch that can be used:(</li>
    <li> Great brush set! This set contains so many brushes and they are of high quality! I love the case they come in.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected. There wasn&#x27;t much difference in any of the brushes. Low quality. The Bristles were coming out before I could even slide the wrapper off</li>
    <li> i choose this rating coz its good but i dont like it very much coz i think its not quite soft</li>
    <li> i bought this for myself and i must say i love these brushes. they shed very little &amp; they are good for everyday use! it comes with a little booklet to let you know what every brush is for.i found that very helpful. i really dont have any complaints about this brush set!...i would def. purchase again &amp; recommend.</li>
    <li> in expensive brushes  and u get great value so i would puchases these brushes again i bought it as presents for my sisters and they luv it lookingto get me a set</li>
    <li> I have been looking for the perfect set of make-up brushes for the longest time.  I saw the reviews left by other customers and figured for the price it was worth a shot.  I have to say I am beyond pleased with my purchase.  After washing the brushes and removing loose hairs and excess die, I found that the brushes were perfect for all my make-up needs.  My sister, who is a make-up artist/cosmetologist is constantly using them as she has compared their quality to some of the higher end make up brushes like Mac and Lancôme but for less then half the price.  If you&#x27;re a little make-up brush challenged like myself, the brush set comes with a great insert that tells you what each brush is used for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend these brushes to anyone looking for good quality brushes at a decent price.</li>
    <li> Never buying again!!!</li>
    <li> Good for the price, every brush you could ever need!</li>
    <li> I bought these over 2 years ago.... and they are STILL holding up. I love the carrying case, which allows for easy travel. Great buy! No regrets.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these they are good in applying makeup and it&#x27;s various with a good price ,but  it&#x27;s not soft on skin !</li>
    <li> I have had these brushes for 2 years now, and provided that a person takes care of them properly they are amazing. I wash mine about once every 4 months or as needed and they stay soft and strong. I use these for professional makeup not daily so they go through a lot. They are easy to clean and work well with several different types of makes, from daily wear to special effects. I highly recommend these. An outstanding deal!</li>
    <li> I knew I was buying 24 brushes but I was surprised at the variety in this package. If you like to wear a lot of different types eye make-up and you like having a virtual arsenal of brushes then this is for you. The quality is excellent and I like the long handles on the brushes. I would recommend this brush set to a friend.</li>
    <li> The color varied slightly from the photo of the largest fan brush but did not at all diminish is quality</li>
    <li> If you need facial brushes this is the way to go, but if you like me and was looking for eye brushes, well, after excessive amounts of shedding, youll find it wasnt worth it, but, the facial brushes are pretty decent. If your a first timer and new to makeup go ahead and spend the nominal fee, however, it may take from start to finish over 2 weeks to receive them</li>
    <li> I could have gotten one MAC brushes with this money, but I got the whole collection, brushes are so smooth and hair never fall off, I tried them with my mineral collection, they are the best, I already had a kabuki brush and I honetly will throw that away, the brushes are so great, Im so happy with my purchase, when I bought them I thought I would get a low quality chinese item, but when they arrived, it was amazing, the packaging was beautiful, leather pouch (real leather, you can smell the leather, not a vinyl) when you open it the first brush is the biggest brush which you barely can see it in pictures of the seller, he may want to change the picture because what I got is much more beautiful than what was listed online, light and smooth handle, easy to use grip makes it very comfortable, this is probably the best one so far I have got from makeup shop. would recommend</li>
    <li> ORIGINAL REVIEW 11/24/2009&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got this brush set today &amp; they arrived sooner than stated, &amp; I live in Oregon. I am a little more than moderately impressed by the quality. Being a makeup artist for a luxury cosmetic line that does not sell brushes like these or even brush sets, I find them to be adequate and of decent quality. I haven&#x27;t observed any excessive shedding, &amp; honestly, no more than some of the more expensive brushes that are sold in other lines in my department. These aren&#x27;t MAC quality brushes, but I love them just as much as my MAC brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 11/26/2009:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, I still \\&quot;heart\\&quot; these brushes. I reviewed these brushes the very first day I got them (11/24/2009) before using them &amp; I just want to mention that these are STILL awesome brushes. As with any new brush, I deodorized them &amp; then thouroughly washed them. I can see why someone would think that they had been used because of the excess dye in the natural hairs, that person obviously does not wash their new brushes before using them for the first time. After deep cleaning them &amp; conditioning them, they stopped shedding and they smell fresh &amp; clean. Please do a deep cleaning on these brushes before using them if you already do not clean your new brushes before first use. Deodorizing, deep cleaning &amp; conditioning them will get all of the loose hairs &amp; excess dye out of the brushes. The excess dye will make your coulours look dirty &amp; muddled if you do not deep clean them. Also after deodorizing &amp; deep cleaning the brushes, I conditioned them and they are all soft and silky just like my Shiseido, Lancome &amp; MAC brushes, except for the synthetic ones which I did not bother conditioning with brush cleaner.  I treated each &amp; every brush with the same care as a much more expensive, pro brush &amp; sincerely, I can&#x27;t tell them apart. Buy these, take good care of them &amp; you will be thoroughly impressed.

    <li> Horrible quality and totally not as described, many brushes come in multiple numbers not worth the money, do not buy</li>
    <li> I love doing my make up and this has been a blast to use not only on myself but my friends and family too.</li>
    <li> This is  definitely a great product to start your kit.  I actually used it for the first time at a fashion show and all my models mentioned how soft the brushes felt.  I would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> The brushes are soft and there is a wide variety of brushes to use. Though it didn&#x27;t come with a list of what the different brushes are you can find it on the Shany website.</li>
    <li> I can finally do my make properly, they are so many different types of good quality brushes in this set and I like the case, it&#x27;s cute and looks posh.</li>
    <li> I love the variety of brushes that come in this set. There&#x27;s a brush for pretty much everything, and they&#x27;re soft and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE these brushes!  They do shed a little, but not excessive. I was a little apprehensive when I was going to buy them, due to using MAC brushes. I wanted to save a little money and found that these were a STEAL! I feel my MAC brushes shed more than these do.  I absolutely LOVE them!</li>
    <li> Love! Love! Love the brushes!  They do fall out of the case occasionally!  The case smelt so horrible upon opening the package and felt like you we&#x27;re being poisoned for 4 days afterwards!</li>
    <li> I am a beginner in makeup and I have bought other brushes from EcoTools, and Elf.  Compared to the Elf dollar brushes, these brushes are awesome and they&#x27;re comparable to EcoTools.  I didn&#x27;t have any shedding.  The hairs are soft to the touch.  One brush that I used did not pick up the product as much as I would like but it worked.  For the price I can&#x27;t really complain. They do the job and that is all I can ask for.</li>
    <li> I was excited/slightly nervous to get theses brushes. Mainly because this deal seems too good to be true! But, I have to say I am quite happy with them. They are very soft, and I didn&#x27;t notice any shedding at all. The case they came in is high quality. They do smell a little funny, but I expect that&#x27;s because they are new. Overall I am excited to create new make up looks with these brushes.    ***Note:this set doesn&#x27;t come with a crease brush :(</li>
    <li> it is a good deal for 32 pcs . but the problem is the fur is coming out lil by lil.  no blending brush. but still it produce nice results.</li>
    <li> Im very happy with this product the brush is so smooth and high quality brush for a reasonable price!! I love it!!</li>
    <li> This are cheap and not worth the money. The hair/bristles fall out of all of them while you are using them. You can find them on your skin and clothes. After I week, I tossed them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! It works really well. I use&lt;br /&gt;It everyday! Shany it really good company! I have a lot of there stuff.</li>
    <li> some bristles do come off on face</li>
    <li> So much verity! I love it to pieces!! They work very well and I haven&#x27;t had them loose any bristles, I bought them in June 2013.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so amazing and for a great price. There is almost any brush you could ever need and they are great quality.</li>
    <li> I was iffy on buying brushes online I couldn&#x27;t see or feel in person, but I love them! There&#x27;s a minor smell when you first get them, nothing more than the &amp;#34;new smell&amp;#34;. Definitely wash the brushes before use. I haven&#x27;t had any problems shedding. Definitely well worth the price!</li>
    <li> These are excellent brushes, especially for the money! They work wonders, and I love playing with all the different brush tips to create different looks. Makeup is super fun again for me thanks to these brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are incredible, I use them more than some of my more expensive ones. No shedding, no funny odor and very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I own two sets of these brushes. The first set I received as a gift when I first started getting into make-up. I did not experience the smell upon opening the brushes that others have reported. They are very soft, they do not shed a lot and are very easy to clean. I use a brush cleaner, warm water and let them air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the brushes to apply my mineral eye shadows, mineral foundation and finishing powders. They provide a nice, even application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a second set to use when applying make-up to others and keep the first set for personal use. I&#x27;ve had many people comment on how soft and light the brushes feel on their skin.</li>
    <li> a few brushes were missing when i opened my package, It would be nice to get a full set next time</li>
    <li> Product came before I was expecting it to arrive. Arrived in great condition, there was no overpowering smell at all and really no falling out of bristles. Great brushes really.</li>
    <li> Bought these brushes in December 2010. I was pondering whether I was gonna write a review or not, but I&#x27;ve had them three months now and i ABSOLUTELY love them!! So I feel I should give credit where it&#x27;s due! When I first got them, yes they had a weird stench on them like the other customers are saying, but it was not as bad as people made it seem. I just left the pouch open for a day or two (so they would catch some air), prewashed the brushes (with baby shampoo and Brush Cleaner) and they were good to go! I didn&#x27;t have any shedding or stiffening of my brushes like others have said! The bristles are really full and soft and the quality is nice. No two brushes are exactly the same, although they may be similar, but you can tell the difference. I have washed the full set of 24brushes approximately 3-5times already and they have maintained the same quality since I bought them. This is my 3rd brush set (but first set of more than 6brushes), so I&#x27;ve seen and used a few others, but this set is really good thus far! It may not be the MAC brand that I usually buy but this set is REALLY good for this low-low price and it does the SAME job.... I TOTALLY recommend!</li>
    <li> makes nice gifts, bought a couple of these as gifts, item as described, no problem with this item</li>
    <li> These brushes are great.&lt;br /&gt;They do have a bit of a smell when you first open them which I believe comes from the \\&quot;leather\\&quot; case, but I washed them and that took care of the smell. I did not experience any shedding. The brushes are very soft and good quality. There is a nice variety of brushes, there are a few that are similar, but none are exactly the same. I do wish there were blending brushes included, but for the price and quality of the brushes included, I can&#x27;t complain too much.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this set.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. They are well made and come in an easy-to-pack leather pouch. I did some research before buying them (I bought the 76 color eyeshadow palette at the same time, love that too) and they have lived up to every one of their claims. The goat and badger hair makes for a high quality brush, and although I am very diligent in keeping them clean they are much easier to use for multiple applications and colors without cleaning them in between uses than other brushes I&#x27;ve used in the past, which tend to retain color residue and darken the lighter shadows I applied afterwards.     They come neatly packaged with separate brush covers in the mail, and keeping them organized is very easy with the pouch. This pouch is great for everyday and long-trip use. If you&#x27;re going on a two-day trip and want to pack light I suggest bringing your travel size brush case. But for vacations when you want to look your loveliest in case you meet your summer fling, bring the pouch and you&#x27;re well equipped for any application needs.     Product is great quality and reasonably priced - highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush set to replace a Ben Nye brush set I had. I love these brushes. The brushes are soft, you have almost every type of brush you&#x27;ll ever need and it&#x27;s in a nice case. I would definitely recommend these brushes to anyone that asked.</li>
    <li> I love these! Theya re a great quality and a huge variety to choose from when doing your make-up routine. I would highly reccomend these to any oneone else and well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I like this product but the only flaw is when you use them the hair are falling and stick on your face... Especially the big brushes but the little brushes the seems fine...</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome!  They are much thicker in person than appears in the pictures online.  The only complaint I have is theres too many brushes.  Definitely worth the price and comes in a nice bag with individual slots for the brushes.</li>
    <li> Received this product within a day after ordering it. I absolutely love it! It is better than expected and a great quality for the price!</li>
    <li> So many brushes to choose from. After washing them i noticed a few loose hairs, but no big deal. These are well made and very soft. I am very happy with these and excited to get them at such a great price.</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome, great quality and great brush size selection!&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought these for a Christmas present for my daughter and wanted to have a lot of brushes so if she messed one up we would have extras and this was a great price for the number of brushes in the package, but when I opened them I was quite amazed at the quality of the brushes!</li>
    <li> I got these brushes yesterday and they are really nice. They are really soft and from what I can tell so far are really great quality. I washed them and no bristles came out! The one downside to them is that the case, though really nice looking, has a weird artificial chemically scent. This does not affect the brushes in any way though, they do not have the scent on them at all. Overall, great product and I would highly recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> Bristles are thin and do not hold powder well. For the price, you can get by with it, next time would rather splurge a bit</li>
    <li> brushes,not soo good,one of them came apart the first time i used it, i just liked the bag where you store them.</li>
    <li> I am a makeup artist and love these brushes - works great on my clients.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great quality.  The set includes multiple eye liner brushes which I thought would be great but I was disappointed. If the product details had a description of each individual brush in the set I wouldn&#x27;t have been so unhappy when I saw a handful of thick line brushes and only 2 angled brushes for thin lines. The pouch is nice but really isn&#x27;t overly impressive. Overall I was happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get these but as soon as I started using them the bristles all started falling out ad continue to do so very disappointed.</li>
    <li> More than i expected!!!! Amazing quality</li>
    <li> Love the brushes. Meets every possible need when applying make-up</li>
    <li> I am still waiting this to arrive. I really don&#x27;t know why I haven&#x27;t received my last few packages at all. This company has made no attempt to contact me to see if the problem can be fixed. As of today, 1/23/13 I am still waiting for my purchase.</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are these absolutely the best brushes ever?  I don&#x27;t know about that, but are they worth getting?  For sure.  I washed them immediately after getting them, and have been using them for several months.  In that time I have not had them shed a single time.  The pouch isn&#x27;t leather, but it&#x27;s not cheap looking, and seems to be holding up well.  The pouch rolls out to display the brushes, and there is extra space that I can put my other brushes so they are all in one place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Love my new brushes.  They pick up blush and shadow very well.  I rinsed them in baby shampoo and then conditioner.  Let them dry for a day...then put them in a crystal jar on my makeup stand.  Haven&#x27;t used them all, but those that I have -- love &#x27;em.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for these brushes but unfortunately i wasted my money. they shed like an animal. seriously i tried to put eyeshadow on and got about four hairs in my eyes. it hurt for 2 days. do not buy these. also they are so soft they dont hold any product. do not waste your money</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;m not going to lie when I say that there are softer, higher quality brushes out there. HOWEVER...you will literally have to pay an insane amount of money per brush for most of them, and I honestly cannot wrap my head around why someone would want to spend hundreds of dollars on brushes when this set has everything you need!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of packaging, the box was in pristine condition when I got it. Inside they put an air filled bag to provide cushioning so that the brushes weren&#x27;t being whipped around. The faux leather case was tightly wrapped, and inside each brush was protected with a plastic covering. The bigger brushes such as the fan brush and the blush brushes also come with another plastic protector that you can keep to protect the bristles. Overall, no issues with packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the brushes themselves, they are very nice. The bristles are much softer than anything you would find at Walmart. Each brush is numbered and corresponds to a number on the fold out page which Shany gives you that names each brush and describes its use.I would definitely wash them before use like the description suggests because the brushes had some kind of white powder in them...no idea why...maybe to keep them fresh smelling I don&#x27;t know. I myself have used them without washing and nothing has irritated my skin, but maybe sensitive skin types might notice something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set is definitely centered around eye brushes and their are plenty of different shapes and sizes to choose from. Overall I think that you can&#x27;t go wrong for the price. I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> All I can say is 5 STARS!! Great set of brushes for a good price!! I definitely like this brush set. Its been doing the job very well for me! If your new to makeup and trying new things I definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes... They didn&#x27;t have a weird smell like other reviews said they did... They are very soft and the case they come in make them very convient to carry around.... I like that it comes with a little booklet letting you know about the different brushes and their particular uses. This was a great buy</li>
    <li> i just got my brushes today. They came packaged well,,and they were in fact in a leather pouch. I love love love them. Cant wait to use them. They are super soft. Needs to be washed because of the strong odor. Overall I am very pleased with my purchase</li>
    <li> The shipment came in fast, and was packaged well. The brushes are soft, however, the hair used for the brushes comes out when in use, but besides that, i love the brushes.</li>
    <li> So these were definitely better than I expected. They do smell a little like plastic but once you wash them and let them air dry they&#x27;re good to go!</li>
    <li> great brushes, hold the eyeshadow very well! and they clean easily. very satisfied! and for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> The brush set I received doesn&#x27;t look like the set in the picture. The ones I received are dark brown. They&#x27;re not good brushes, either. The hair falls off of them and they&#x27;re not very soft. They remind me of cheap watercolor brushes for kids. I&#x27;ve bought better makeup brushes from CVS.</li>
    <li> The shipping was stupid (it was in my area 2 days before being sent to my home, according to the tracking number). I&#x27;m a cosmetologist &amp; I found the brushes themselves are wonderful. I read the reviews on how the apparently shed &amp; make-up artists/cosmetologists wash them before using them. I used them before washing them &amp; had no problem with shedding or anything. These brushes are working wonderfully &amp; there&#x27;s no odor like a good portion of these reviews stated.</li>
    <li> I wasted my money ! I am so disappointed in this purchase!!!  When I started to use all the hairs in the brush came out on my face! Total garbage do not purchase!</li>
    <li> This is a very cheap set. Every time I used this it leaves hair on my face. Just buy a quality set.</li>
    <li> great assortment and quality.</li>
    <li> Not worth it ! I threw it away!</li>
    <li> I bought them as a Christmas gift for my niece.  She says she is very happy with them.  Reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I own different brush sets (vegan, synthetic) but decided on this set because I wanted more softer bristles and &#x27;real&#x27; hair brushes would make a difference with my makeup application and it does! From the makeup application to the blending- great brushes to work with. I wasn&#x27;t so thrilled about the &#x27;odor&#x27; of the brushes, but after a few washes it does go away. So far, this is my favorite set! Looking forward in trying other Shany products.</li>
    <li> You get, what you pay.</li>
    <li> I have read many of the reviews for this product, and I have to say I disagree with most of the negative reviews . There is no unusual smell . I smell leather. I hand washed these brushes upon receiving these cosmetic brushes air dried them overnight. I experienced absolutely no shedding of these cosmetic brushes. I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I was in the market for a good set of makeup brushes and found this Shany product. I expected the product to be \\&quot;good\\&quot; but upon receipt I was pleasantly suprised at the high quality of the brushes.  I would highly recommend this set.</li>
    <li> I WON THESE BRUSHES IN A CONTEST SHANY COSMETICS WAS HOSTING ON FACEBOOK AND WHEN I RECEIVED THESE BRUSHES IN THE MAIL I FELL IN LOVE!! YOU HAVE A VARIETY OF FACE AND EYE BRUSHES! PERFECT FOR A BEGINNER IN MY OPINION! THE BRUSH SET IS SLEEK AND BLACK AND IT LOOKS VERY PROFESSIONAL!! THEY HAVENT SHED ON ME YET AND I CLEAN THEM WEEKLY! I HAVE HAD THEM SINCE MAY OR JUNE...BEEN A WHILE...THE PACKAGING IS GREAT..LOVE THE LEATHER CASE..LIKE I SAID BEFORE THIS SET LOOKS VERY HIG END AND PROFESSIONAL!! WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!! WORTH THE PRICE!</li>
    <li> The people that said these brushes aren&#x27;t soft must be crazy... I love these brushes! They are extremely soft! Some people may not like how many brushes there are  but if you are serious about makeup then you know you need size options and this set has plenty! Great product for what you pay for it! :)</li>
    <li> This product is very soft. Because I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;m picky with brushes, these are great to have! What I really don&#x27;t like about these brushes are the endurance of the handles. The day I received it, I made sure everything was accounted for and \\&quot;attached\\&quot; like anyone would, or should in some cases. As I gently tugged on the metal pieces, they all were fine and fully attached until I came across.... THE FAN BRUSH! I slipped the plastic covering off the wrong way and BAM, it all fell apart. It was a disappointment. But it&#x27;s not like the brand was MAC(r), so there&#x27;s not much to complain about. Just take some super glue and glue it back on. ;) Being smart is a great advantage! :) Overall, this product is good!</li>
    <li> Fun set.  I really like the pouch.  Yes, you&#x27;ll notice the smell when you open the plastic, but it&#x27;s fine after a day or so.  And then, it folds up really well and keeps the brushes protected.  Out of the 24, there are 4 brushes I use constantly.  (the eyebrow-filler one--and there is a smaller replica of it that I use as backup, for when my toddler runs off with the regular sized one that I usually use, the under-the-eye-liner one, and a blush one and a bronzer one.)  Then, occassionally, I also use the 2 eyelash combers and a small just-under-the-brow brush. I don&#x27;t regret buying the set.  It is overkill, yes.  I didn&#x27;t/don&#x27;t need/want all 24 brushes provided, but I didn&#x27;t know back then what I would want or need, and now I have 4 brushes that I totally want and need and use all the time (and 4 that I often appreciate) and they work terrifically.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues (with my 8 that I use) with shedding or any other type of decomposing of ability.  I&#x27;ve been using them regularly for 6 months.  As a sidenote, I also got the ecotools 6 piece eye brush set and I don&#x27;t know how I could live without the highlight brush for applying eyeshadow!  But that&#x27;s just me.  I also use the smallest one for the inner corners of my eye and highlighting my brow. I sometimes use the smudge one.  Happy highlighting out there.  Good luck to you all.</li>
    <li> I gave it 4 stars because of the price, it is really cheap to get all 24 brushes at the price below $20. In addition, the brushes do not look cheap at all, but the smell is awfull like previous reviews. I just got the brushes today and I washed them all. But I think time goes by, the smell will disappear, I hope:), it is really good set for a make-up beginner.</li>
    <li> love these brushes they are inexpensive, they do not shed at all and i got them in 2 days. the only problem i had was i pulled too hard the top off my fan brush came off but nothin a little glue can&#x27;t fix. I would recommend and i&#x27;m also gonna check out what else shany studio has too offer.i&#x27;m always looking for good deals and this was definitely one of them</li>
    <li> I love these Brushes.  For the Price, these brushes can not get better. I bought them as a gift to myself and now i am ordering more to give out as Christmas Gifts. The quality is great they have an even spread for products and pick up the product well. I have worked as a Make up Coach and have used some of the best(very expensive) brushes. Price is not a deciding factor on make up brushes. I can promise you that! These Brushes are worth the money. Possibly worth more than the Price. Great assortment of sizes to do many different designs. Keep them clean and they will go far. I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit dosappointed in these brushes after reading all the great reviews. The brushes don&#x27;t really pick up that well, and they are hard to clean (meaning if I&#x27;ve used one of the brushes to apply black eye shadow, or black gel eye liner, the brush is still black even aftyer washing it many times). This set doesn&#x27;t make you go \\&quot;wow!\\&quot;, it makes you go \\&quot;I&#x27;m so irritated that this set LOOKS so great, but in reality feels like something you&#x27;d use when you&#x27;re 10 yrs old just playing with mommy&#x27;s make-up and when she doesn&#x27;t really want anything sticking to your face.\\&quot;Lol.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes for painting with acrylic paint as an artist  BUT THEY ARE NOT IN A LEATHER CASE  I even ordered 3 more sets for some of the gals I paint with[[ASIN:B002DOO1VA Shany Studio Quality Natural Cosmetic Brush Set with Leather Pouch, 24 Count]]</li>
    <li> This are the best set of brushes for the price and quality! I got one for my girlfriend and one for doter for Christmas and they love them!</li>
    <li> I currently attend Esthetician school and will soon graduate with a Master&#x27;s Certification.  Part of the certification in my state includes professional Make-up specialist.  I have very expensive make-up sets and brushes from Mirabella and MAC. We practice techniques constantly and do alot of makeup on students, clients and for service projects.  I didn&#x27;t want to use my expensive brushes, but still wanted similar results.  I searched and searched and bought several inexpensive versions....all just a waste of time, effort and money.  I came across these and decided to give it another try.  I&#x27;m glad I did!  This set looks professional from the get-go with black &#x27;leather-like&#x27; roll case and individual brush covers.  The assortment is awesome and the brushes themselves are impressive.  Even a huge fan brush that is hard to find.  They are all black or black/brown bristles....all are natural, soft, and nice and dense. I am buying a couple more sets to use as gifts...I would not be embarrassed to give these....no cheasy cheap stuff here!  Only thing better would be a nice big kabuki brush....but I guess I can&#x27;t have it all! I have to say I&#x27;m pressed by this value, and I don&#x27;t easily impress.  Go for it!</li>
    <li> I had decided to be a \\&quot;big girl\\&quot; (at age 39) and make an effort to use brushes more capably and frequently.  Obviously, I had always used brushes for blush/bronzer/eyelid crease etc., but was guilty of often using my fingers for application of eyelid colors and foundation/concealers/highlighters. In other words, I needed to grow up a bit and learn to use real tools where I might have more control of what I was doing, instead of applying make-up the same way I have since I was 12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great quality brushes.  Very dense and \\&quot;stable\\&quot;.  One reason I would often resort to my fingers is that I didn&#x27;t ever want to make a big investment in brushes as I feared I might not \\&quot;get the hang of them\\&quot; or find out that I wouldn&#x27;t want to take the extra time/steps they demand over using the trusty fingers...so any brushes I had purchased were of the \\&quot;discount\\&quot; variety. Well, those brushes, barring a few, were always flimsy, too soft and \\&quot;floppy\\&quot; or weirdly edged so that whatever I was trying to do with the brush seemed less successful than my fingers...so, I always resorted back to the hands.  When I saw this kit on Amazon, I realized it had a million brushes for a very reasonable price, so MAYBE I could find one or 2 that would work and I could, alas...be more grown-up in my technique.  When the brushes got here, it was immediately evident by the feel that they were plenty dense, not floppy/flimsy etc. like most less expensive brushes.  When I loaded them with product, they deposited colors evenly and with ease. Dare I say, with the exception of the \\&quot;extra step\\&quot;, they rival my finger&#x27;s capabilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Multiple Sizes/Shapes; For brush gurus and newbies alike, there are plenty of sizes, shapes and \\&quot;edges\\&quot; to do whatever you need to do. If you have a favorite brush shape, there are at least 3 of each shape in various sizes to meet your application needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handy Case; The case is soft, supple and rolls up neatly. This is perfect for travel, tho I, myself, am far too lazy to insert each brush back in it&#x27;s little designated spot each and every time I use them. An added bonus, for those less lazy than me, is that each brush comes with a durable plastic protective sleeve.  I would imagine this would keep product from rubbing off on other items, and most importantly...will keep the brush shape in tact.  Very nice packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Instructions/labeling; Okay, so most people probably don&#x27;t need guidance the way I do, but it would be nice if the brushes were labeled, or even if there was a product insert that listed the most common uses for the types/shapes/sizes of brushes.  As a noob, I wasn&#x27;t sure which I should use for concealer, or which I should use for eyeshadow. Oh, and what was the difference between the \\&quot;blush brushes\\&quot; that all appeared fairly similiar? What do people use that giant fan brush for?  Why are there 32384238 flat square edged brushes? What do the cool kids do with those?  In other words, I was confused and found myself searching the internet for \\&quot;guidance\\&quot; as to what brushes are best for what.  This probably is a non-issue for most, but for me, it would have been nice to have some direction as soon as I opened the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Few Stray Hairs; As a cosmetic brush noob, I can only assume that the best quality brushes don&#x27;t have shedding or random \\&quot;strays\\&quot;.  I have dabled in some painting in my life, and know that longer odd hairs at a different length than the brush&#x27;s \\&quot;chisel\\&quot;, and some shedding, is to be expected from the \\&quot;budget brands\\&quot;.  While these are by no means AWFUL, buyers just need to be sure to pull on the bristles to get loose hairs out before first application.  Once I did this, I didn&#x27;t have any problem with additional hairs coming out.  It seems that just the manufacturing process might have left the strays.  I also have found a few long hair \\&quot;randoms\\&quot; that might need to be trimmed for the more discerning consumer.  For me, those are a non issue as I&#x27;m not exactly a professional.  This \\&quot;con\\&quot; is not major, but thought it worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Long Handled; This should be abundantly obvious from the photos, so this is not a TRUE \\&quot;con\\&quot;, in the sense that it wasn&#x27;t what you expected, but all brushes are long handled.  There are a few applications where I might prefer a shorter brush. Patting on eyelid color, for example...for me would be easier to \\&quot;control\\&quot; with a shorter brush.  I have hooded lids so trying to get the lightest color in a specific area with a giant long handle takes some getting used to.

This kit did not have one of those specifically.  Since I used this kind of brush to smudge eyeliner harsh lines etc., I was able to find some alternatives in the kit. I used the angled brushes (good for eyebrow filling) and or some of the smaller flat/oval/chiseled brushes to do the same thing my beloved \\&quot;pencil brush\\&quot; did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this kit is worth entertaining, especially for someone just wanting to try some new brushes and/or application techniques.

    <li> Beautiful brush set. I bought this to go with my Shany 40 and Shany 96 pallet eye shadows. I&#x27;ve never bought Shany products before but have been looking at them for a while now. So happy that I bought these brushes and not some junk ones from other companies. They are Beautiful. Great leather holding case as well. It has a great range of brushes. I model part time and need brushes that will last, wont shed and put on an even coverage. Great product. A must have for any Shany makeup enthusiast!</li>
    <li> I have wanted new makeup brushes for quite awhile, but didn&#x27;t want to pay alot of money for them. I was searching online and came across some great reviews of this product (other than the ones listed on Amazon). For the price, it seemed like a great deal. I received my set very quickly, and I have been very happy with my purchase! I did buy brush cleaner as well, so I made sure to clean them all before my first use. So far they have held up great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one suggestion would be for them to mark the brushes with what they are supposed to be used for or include a handy tip chart. I have never owned this many makeup brushes before, so for me it was hard to know what brush to use for what purpose. Slowly but surely, I am figuring it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a teen that tried to be thrifty even though I needed a good pro set. From seeing previous reviews, I guess i shouldn&#x27;t have been disappointed, but i was :( Because i was excited to get a pro brush set with the roll up case and everything but the actual brushes are kinda disappointing. However, cases like this for brushes could actually be the price of this whole brush set, so i guess it was worth it. I can add previously brought brushes n put them in the case, as well as buy the ones that i want n add em. I saw people complain about the smell, but mine was normal, just left it open for the afternoon n it&#x27;s fine. Its just a plastic smell, nothing&#x27;s wrong with it... The brushes lack variety though. They&#x27;re basically the same set repeated, and they get larger lol. From the pictures, i thought i might have gotten a pencil brush, or a nice C brush or a good fluffy blending brush. I agree with previous reviews. They&#x27;re good, and I can see them lasting a while...Shany brushes have impressed me before, but they aren&#x27;t for those advanced in the makeup business. It&#x27;s a good set for people starting off or who don&#x27;t really want a large selection of brushes. The brushes included here are 2 angled eyeliner/shadow brushes, a few flat liner brushes, a few normal shadow brushes, 2 lip brushes, a sponge applicator, eyelash(mascara) brush, eyebrow brush/comb, 3 powder brushes and a fan brush.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product for professional, along with anyone who want to look great. These Brushes are so saft on the skin. Clean well, with the wide variety of brushes for everything.  Love the handles, the lenth of brushes and ease of handling. I give a perfect 5 stars would give 10 but not avalible.  Wonderful product keep these with out improving them they are great the way they are. I came to my usuall hunt for company Amazon.com to find the perfect product. Alway have what I need with great prices. I live quite a distance couple hours away from mayor shopping so Amazon is my perfect store. I recoment Shany Brushes, and comsmetic. If you want to look good these are the best Brushes for you. Shany Studio Quality Natural Cosmetic Brush Set with Leather Pouch, 24 count.  Great Price also.</li>
    <li> Just what she wanted for Christmas</li>
    <li> These brushes are AWFUL! the material is horrible!! The product doent stick in the plastic/sintetic hair, I dont recommend to anyone to but this, I am VERY dissapointed about it</li>
    <li> Purchased as a Christmas gift for my sister. she went BANANAS!!!! nailed that gift!</li>
    <li> brushes arrived on time no fall out no weird smell either. great quality can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
    <li> I have looked at alot of Brush sets this is very very good.  I would recommend  to the novice or the pro makeup.</li>
    <li> Great selection of brushes but they came rolled up so the bristles were bent on a few. Haven&#x27;t been able to straighten them out. But I guess for the price it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS AND EcoTools FOUNDATION BRUSH($5.80) AT THE SAME TIME. AND I GOT THEN AT THE SAME SAME TIME, I CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE RIGHT THE WAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHANY:&lt;br /&gt;THE BRUSHES ARE DUSTY AND DIRTY ,&lt;br /&gt;IT IS NOT SOFT AT ALL,&lt;br /&gt;DOES NOT WORTH THE MONEY!&lt;br /&gt;THE COLOR COME WITH TOTALLY DIFFERENT COLOR:&lt;br /&gt;THEY ARE LIGHT BROWN IN THE PICTURE,BUT I RECEIVED WITH DARK BROWN ALMOST BLACK BRUSHES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EcoTools :&lt;br /&gt;soft, cheap, really nice one!&lt;br /&gt;All their brush are soft and nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WAS BEEN STUPID TO BUT THIS BRUSH SET, AND NOW IM GOING TO RETURN IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SAVE YOURSELF FROM TROUBLE, DON&#x27;T BUT THIS</li>
    <li> I just love these brushes they come in a beautiful leather bag they are numbered and the instructions tell you what each brush is for. There are great so glad I bought them.</li>
    <li> I really like these, it&#x27;s a good starter kit for eye makeup and countouring specifically, it&#x27;s not the softest but it&#x27;s a good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> I really like all of the brushes that come in this wet. It&#x27;s helpful for someone like me who normally uses a very small variety of brush types. Only downside is that the larger brushes tend to shed hairs pretty easily.</li>
    <li> I was SO excited when I ordered these brushes based on all the good reviews that it had but when I received them I was heartbroken!! When I opened the package there was brush hairs everywhere! I don&#x27;t know if I received just a defective set or if they are all like that. I returned for a refund as I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from another set, had I exchanged them. :-(</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter whose just got into makeup, she loves it, I am going to get more set for my sister and nieces.</li>
    <li> The brush case looked old &amp; used. The brushes shed when it clearly said no shedding coming from these brushes. I still use them because I have to. Still work pretty good tho. The delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> I gave them as a gift to my mother, and she loved them!</li>
    <li> The product itself is great I love it, everything is high quality and nice. I would like it if the brushes were marked as to what they were though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it literally took about a month for it to get delivered. But other than that I was pleased.</li>
    <li> I just received these brushes, not sure what to think of them yet because I have not tried them, however they seem to have everything I&#x27;m looking for as of right now, I&#x27;m just waiting to try them out and hoping they are of good quality. I will get back to this.</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes because I was looking to replace my mac brushes which were reaching the end of their life. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on brushes and the reviews for these ones seemed decent enough. When the brushes arrived, as many reviews had stated, the case and thus the brushes smelled like gasoline. As I proceed to wash all of my brushes with a brush cleaner (from MAC), the scent came right out of the brushes and with some febreeze and a fan, the case smells much better now too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are fantastic. I was expecting hard brushes that shed a lot, I mean what can one expect from cheaply priced brushes? To my surprise, the brushes are soft, retain powder well, and I have experienced little to no shedding! The quality is great and I would buy these again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> Love the new brushes and the case they came in. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish some of the brushes could be just a bit harder.</li>
    <li> The best brush set ever!!</li>
    <li> Purchased for the GF so far she loves them. Quality product at a decent price.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased these brushes and just looking at the price, I became a fan! Sigma, Sedona Lace, and MAC brushes are way pricier than this set, you could buy just one MAC brush for the price of all of these! I think this is an excellent kit for beginners, especially those on a budget. It has every brush you could ever need! I noticed a minimal amount of shedding from these brushes when I began using them, after two weeks no more hairs have fallen out. I would suggest including a guide in the package for what each brush should be used for, because beginners are definitely ideal buyers for this kit and they may be confused as what to use them for. They are very soft, pick up product easily, and are not a hassle to clean. The case had an odd smell, which I didn&#x27;t love. I would certainly recommend these to friends and definitely those just starting with makeup. This was a hit for me!</li>
    <li> These brushes are soooooo soft! And so complete!!! All you need to create your look! I have been using them for a few months and these are easy to maintain, becoming softer with each wash! I heart these!!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes. They are good quality for a good price. I&#x27;m like a hoarder of makeup brushes too. I can never have enough, so I&#x27;m always out there looking for great new brands, or new styles that I haven&#x27;t tried yet. I really like these. They get the job done. :D</li>
    <li> This is a nice set! Very professional looking. I have always wanted a good set of makeup brushes and this fits the bill! Great presentation for any makeup artist!</li>
    <li> These brushes feel like brushes i would buy out of Wal Mart. The other (12 piece set) Shany brushes were softer. I dont like these.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t afford MAC  brushes but buying these were worth the money, I ordered this set for my older sister in beauty school. And she loved them, I must say also that these brushes are so soft and easy to grip. I have a problem with awkward fitting brushes in my hand but this is perfect.</li>
    <li> I really liked the price and how fast it came in the mail. Besides the smell that came with bag it was really really nice.</li>
    <li> love them. Retail stores do not come even close in their quality or extensive set options for the price.The case is leather and the brushes are super soft.</li>
    <li> Once again shany has done it again.like i said before great quality brushes,love the bristles they are soft but firm.</li>
    <li> A little strong smelling at first-plastic.  But a quick wash fixed that problem. My daughter is 15 and loves these brushes.</li>
    <li> This product is definitely worth it. You pay LESS than a dollar per brush! and it STILL comes in a handy little pouch. How could anyone pass up an offer like that?</li>
    <li> This brush set is great!!! It came with 24 amazing brushes. I was a little weary at first but the price is so good and I&#x27;m super impressed with the quality. It helps me keep them together and not mixed in with my other brushes with the leather pouch it comes with! It&#x27;s great for travel!</li>
    <li> Considering that I only paid $16.95 for this brush set, I can say that it&#x27;s not too much of a disappointment. However what was disappointing was the large fan brush and the fact that the \\&quot;leather pouch\\&quot; wasn&#x27;t actually leather but vinyl instead. This set is good for beginners.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend bought these and within seconds of using them for the first time they fell apart. Her makeup was completely full of hairs that had come out of the brush. She even washed them the proper way and they still were badly falling out. Not happy with this purchase. I know that they are a cheap alternative but after reading most of the reviews I assumed that they would not be that bad.</li>
    <li> there is no reason to not buy this simply because its fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;the quantity you get for that low of a price is great, but the quality is even better.&lt;br /&gt;every brush is soft and durable.&lt;br /&gt;each brush is in the roll which smells like leather although its some other material.&lt;br /&gt;each brush is also packaged within the roll so they are protected when they arrive.&lt;br /&gt;i recommend washing each brush before use just for hygenic reasons but these brushes are fabulous and well worth the affordable price</li>
    <li> These Brushes are great! and very affordable! feels great and the color is very nice. Brush for everything you can imagine for the eyes and face. Would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> For the amount of brushes you get and the quality, I think this is a great deal. I don&#x27;t use the brushes for every day use because they do shed a bit and the quality isn&#x27;t the greatest, but they are still good brushes. I also love the leather pouch they come with. This is in my tool belt whenever I do makeup shoots.</li>
    <li> I love how sleek looking these brushes are. You can find a purpose for every brush. I&#x27;m not one to splurge on brushes, especially on MAC or Sigma, yet this brush set does the job. I enjoy the fan brush to apply a highlight on my upper cheeks and the shadow brushes fit perfectly on my eyelids so  I apply the perfect amount of eyeshadow without overdoing it.</li>
    <li> The case is very strong smelling and I am pretty positive it is not made out of real leather -- but I didn&#x27;t think the price could possibly include real leather -- so I wonder how they get away with claiming that?!&lt;br /&gt;The brushes need to be throughly washed and conditioned.  They do shed a bit for the first few uses.  The set is missing some essential brushes -- foundation, a densely-packed bristle concealer brush and a fine liner brush.  Over all, I think it&#x27;s a great value, but if you&#x27;re used to higher-end brand brushes, these cannot compete.</li>
    <li> when i got these brushes, i was a bit skeptical because the brush pouch smelled like plastic. when i opened the brush roll, i was pleased to find that i had all 24 brushes. i didn&#x27;t think that the brushes would be soft, but they definitely were! they also didn&#x27;t shed. i wish that i would&#x27;ve gotten a better variety for the eye brushes, but overall, these brushes are great!(:</li>
    <li> the brushes are all good and different sizes, soft and flufy and has an amazing foldable case for easy storage</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with these brushes. They feel soft and came with a great assortment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Very good quality for the low price. These aren&#x27;t going to perform like Mac brushes, but they are a very good alternative for 1/20th the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: They must be washed before use to eliminate loose hairs. You might see 1 hair shed every other use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for anyone with a limited budget.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so soft.Doing make-up is a little bit of a chellenge because of the babies.They pick up product so well, which helps me get my make-up done very quick and easy.With these brushes it makes getting ready a little more exciting.</li>
    <li> I recieved my brushes today \\&quot;very quickly\\&quot; they are great! They are very soft, they won&#x27;t be hard on my skin. Ok, I don&#x27;t think that the case is leather but I did not buy it for the case. I am very happy with my purchase!!! I do recommend them. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002DOO1VA Shany Studio Quality Natural Cosmetic Brush Set with Leather Pouch, 24 Count]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must have had stars in my eyes when I opened the package. The flat brushes will work for cream eyeshadow, not powder (unless used how previously stated). I know you may be thinking how wonderful this could be &amp; hoping that it works out for you the way it worked out for all these 5 star reviewers. That&#x27;s how I felt. But, now I have gone right to the MAC website &amp; ordered a complete brush set (of course separately). And after spending over $400, I can rest assured I will get a very quality brush that will last me a very, very long time. I will keep these brushes, and use them for... painting???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, let me say that I have just received the brushes. I have not used them yet. I will return to add more onto this review after I use them, &amp; then again after I have been using them for a few weeks. Please read the entire review before forming an opinion because... well, you will see!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I WILL LEAVE MY FIRST REVIEW SO YOU CAN SEE WHY SOMETIMES THIS PRODUCT GETS 5 STARS, I LEFTY 5 STARS WITH THIS FIRST REVIEW)&lt;br /&gt;First, let me tell you what you probably know already... this is an AMAZING deal for the price. I have been using brushes for over 12 years, and always high-end brushes (MAC, Chanel, Bobbi Brown, etc.), and I am very pleased with the quality of these brushes thus far. For about $1/piece you can&#x27;t go wrong with any brush. These are exceptional brushes. I would happily pay 5 times this price. They are worth even more than that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They arrived SO fast! I live in Maui &amp; it only took 3 days to get here. The brush roll (pouch) did have a slight chemical smell. But it dissipated within minutes of airing it out. I noticed most of the brushes had some loose hairs(already???). Another thing I didn&#x27;t like is that the hairs on the outer edges will not sit flush with the brush. This usually happens after some use of even high-end brushes.But, I have never seen this on a brand new brush.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I did was to shampoo &amp; condition my new brushes (This takes about 45 minutes to an hour). I used Dr. Bronners Castile Soap Baby-Mild &amp; WEN Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner. However, you can use any shampoo &amp; conditioner. I would recommend that you do NOT use sulfates. {Another great wash is Dessert Essences Thoroughly Clean Face Wash with Tea Tree Oil &amp; Awapuhi. The tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic &amp; there are no sulfates so you get double the benefits. You should always clean &amp; condition natural brushes before use &amp; at least once a month or every 1-2 weeks if you use them daily. They will last much longer &amp; your face will thank you for it.} During the wash, more hairs came out &amp; on the big brushes the dye washed out completely. I let them dry &amp; now they are SOOO much softer and, so far, no shedding! Unfortunately, the hairs on the edge still will not sit flush. There are only a few little hairs &amp; I hope it won&#x27;t affect application. I may just trim them off. There is only a hair here &amp; there so it probably won&#x27;t harm the brush to trim them right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use them tonight &amp; come back to let you guys know how it went :)</li>
    <li> Well I spent half the time picking the brush strands off my face, neck and chest area as they kept falling.  But the fact that there are so many I could use to give the effect I wanted was nice.  Not entirely sure I will keep them.  They aren&#x27;t soft either.  I used them for the first time today and certainly wasn&#x27;t thrilled.</li>
    <li> These are a lot of brushes but there weren&#x27;t really any brushes for eye shadows majority of the brushes were concealer brushes</li>
    <li> nice quality brushes and a convenient stylist case. Ordered and was here before I knew it. Haven&#x27;t used all the brushes yet but I am very happy with it so far.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!  All I need for a great price!</li>
    <li> I use these brushes every single time I do my makeup now, and I am super happy that I bought these. They make my makeup routine look twice as good with half the amount of time I used to spend when I did my makeup.</li>
    <li> I did have alittle shedding in my the beginning but I washed them and they were fine! Would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Unlike other fairly cheap brushes,  the case did not have a plastic smell to it and the brushes dont shed alot.</li>
    <li> I ordered these about 3 days ago and just got them today. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them yet but wanted to post a review for those who might be considering purchasing. First off, they do arrive in a nice leather-like pouch. The pouch is nice for keeping everything together all in one place, but since it is (i&#x27;m guessing) a plastic material the brushes do have sort of a plastic-y odor to them.  This isn&#x27;t a huge deal for me because I plan on washing them anyway.  Being that I&#x27;m just starting to experiment with makeup I wanted something nice but inexpensive and these seem to work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: nice soft brushes, love the matte look of the handles, there are a variety of brushes for you to use, the price when I purchased was what I would consider a really good deal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: some of the brushes are too soft, I wish some of the liner brushes were a little more firm. also I wish the brushes were numbered sort of how mac brushes are so that I could easily identify which is which&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - I&#x27;d say purchase these brushes. You can&#x27;t go wrong with the price and you really are getting a great value for what you pay. Even if you find that you can only use 1 or 2 of the brushes for your every day looks its still cheaper than what you would pay for just one brush from some other brands.</li>
    <li> These brushes are worth the cost, i loved them, there wasnt any weird scent and the brushes do not shed!</li>
    <li> Amazing brush set.&lt;br /&gt;No loose bristles what so ever.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I will ever be able to use all these brushes!!! So many sizes and styles... you can definitely find your favorites. Brushes are firm for easy use but very soft. Pouch keeps everything well organized.</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes.  I use them every morning.  Unless you are a really beauty savvy person, I suggest not throwing out the little card that tells what each brush is for.  I did and can&#x27;t find out the specific use of each one, but they all work wonderfully as I&#x27;ve been using them.</li>
    <li> This set was an amazing deal. I&#x27;ve been using it for a year? Maybe 2, I can&#x27;t remember when I ordered it, but all the brushes are in great shape. No shedding. Always clean your brushes and they will last.</li>
    <li> I read tons of reviews before buying brushes online. Most were very positive so I decided to give it a try. Brushes came in a nice case (not leather though as they promise). The smell was so strong, I could barely breathe openning the package. All brushes are cheap and too soft. Probably worth $25 they were priced.   I&#x27;m not a make up artist, but want to have nice brushes for my make up. People, don&#x27;t be cheap! Better buy 5 nice brushes and enjoy them.</li>
    <li> I bought this Shany brush set mainly because I read more positive reviews than negative. for the price, i thought what the heck, it was worth a try. well, i got them and the first thing i noticed was what other reviewers had pointed out, an awful chemical smell. this smell comes from the pouch itself and it transfers to the brushes making it very unpleasant to use.  The other thing I noted was the feel of the brushes. Weightwise, they are very light and quite frankly, feel \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; for lack of a better word. Third and most importantly, besides the claim that it&#x27;s badger hair which is ok and all, there&#x27;s just not enough of it on the wand to make it a real brush. It just doesn&#x27;t pick up my eyeshadow properly and looks and feels flat. I have \\&quot;Cala\\&quot; brand brushes that are far better than these.  in short, if you are a make up artist or an aspiring one, these brushes aren&#x27;t for you. on the latter, if you just want to waste your money and have your bathroom or vanity smelling like a science lab then the Shany Brush Set is right for you.  peace!</li>
    <li> I just got this package today and they are great brushes very good deal on these! The brushes arrived early and was in great condition thank you!</li>
    <li> Awesome product.!!!! I dont really understand how girls can spend $100 on MAC brushes, that is ridiculous!. Just buy them, they dont shed, they are soft but tight, and shiny, they are beautiful! Im not a make up guru or artist or anything, I&#x27;ve never really used makeup until now and that&#x27;s why I got these, to start with something. Awesome product, just buy it, I have seen other brushes, like SIGMA and other stores, I would never buy a $20 brush if a $1 one does the job.</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush set not expecting too much for the price...I needed some new concealer brushes and small bruses for detailed eye looks.  I worked as a makeup artist for MAC for several years so I&#x27;ve had the opp. to work with almost every quality brush in the industry.  First, let me say this DOES NOT come with a foundation or powder brush.  I reccomend supplimenting the kit with Eco Tools or Sonja Kushuk powder/foundation brushes.  Second, there are alot of \\&quot;repeats\\&quot; in the kit...ex, there are like 5 concealer brushes which vary slightly in size.  The kit also has a few \\&quot; worthless\\&quot; brushes...there are 3 square liner brushes, 2 of which are floppy and they were unevenly cut....(I gave them to my son to use for art projects) and the third is barely salvageable...its just not stiff enough to do liner.  I&#x27;m keeping it, I&#x27;m sure I will eventually find a use...The shadow brushes are great, with a large variation of sizes...no \\&quot;MAC Type\\&quot; crease brush...there are plenty of eye brushes for detailed intricate looks...blush/bronzer brushes are very good and there is also a huge fan brush for blending...not bad!!!  I read alot of reviews where ppl said their brushes had a terrible smell b/c of the pleather pouch....mine didn&#x27;t. I also washed all my brushes in baby shampoo and conditioned them which is a MUST!!!!  Use a silicone free conditioner, I use Suave XTra body.  Lay bruses flat on a towel to dry.  NEVER place brushes upright to dry, the moisture will seep down into the brush and it will rot  and smell over time.  Now my brushes are very soft and workable.  This is a excellent set for beginers or travel...imo worth more than $16.99...Also, if your not doing alot of detail work, the 13 piece set will work fine instead of this 24 piece set.  Oh, BTW I noticed many ppl complaining abt shedding, my brushes seem fine and have not shed...but I&#x27;ve only used them 2x....all in all, good stuff!!!!</li>
    <li> Basic quality brushes, but perfect for daily makeup users like myself. I love that this came with a lot of brushes and at such a great price!</li>
    <li> arrived in time, with all parts in tacked ans new. it came in a good size box which was lovely, but inside was a different story. the contents were all smashed inside. it was rolled up which was fine, but it was so tight and smashed that it left lasting folds and creases in the carry case it came in!&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t get me wrong the brushed are used and work well but carry case and strap were smashed and creased and not looking professional like they should be.</li>
    <li> Only complaint about this set is that it sheds and that is so annoying. However the variety of brushes is great and there is a guide that tells you what each brush is used for.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very nice. Arrived on time. The leather pouch holds all brushes and seems to be very well made. The brush hair is soft and plush. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> After reading some of the really good reviews on here, I thought that these brushes were worth it. When I got them in the mail and opened them, the smell from the leather case was terrible, and it made the brushes stink. I immediately noticed that most of the face brushes were shedding as well. I just put that fact aside and went ahead and washed them. After I washed them, they still smelled bad. I used the face brushes this morning, and they shed like crazy. The smaller foundation/eye brushes aren&#x27;t that bad. But I am disappointed with the big face brushes and the packaging overall.</li>
    <li> For a make up beginner, I definitely recommend this product especially since its affordable. The hairs sheds a little bit but once you wash it, it&#x27;ll eventually stop. It&#x27;s pretty durable meaning when you pull on the metal part it won&#x27;t fall apart. The hairs are very soft and it feels good on my skin. Hope this convinces you to buy it! I was very satisfied with my set :)</li>
    <li> i love how it comes with the case to keep them in. i absolutely love these brushes! might be a little expensive but definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> everyone knows youre supposed to wash your brushes.  when you wash these and you let them dry they literally fall apart, not to mention smell like animal hair.  theyre coarse and loose their shape.    i recommend these. I just bought these a week ago. theyre sturdy and soft and don&#x27;t smell like an animal.  [...]</li>
    <li> This is my first set of makeup brushes, true sometimes I will find a hair has fallen out of the brush but that&#x27;s rare.  Great value for the buy, it has all the brushes I need  :)</li>
    <li> As advertise. Great brushes, great quality and very economical. I am really enjoying my new find. Hope you find this review helpful.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t actually opened and used them yet, because they are a Christmas present for my teenage daughter, but they look great, arrived very quickly and I know she is going to love them! Thank you so much for providing such a great product at a great price!!</li>
    <li> I am disappointed in this brush set.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and the bristles are falling off!  Each time I use the foundation and powder brush, my entire face is covered with bristles.  I give it an extra star because I like the precise application of the eye shadow brushes.  I don&#x27;t recommend it, at least not for the ridiculous price.</li>
    <li> I thought its a good brand but hair falls a lot when I use it.</li>
    <li> these brushes are great qaulity there affordable and very well packaged you get 32 for 15bucks what a steal i love these animal fur brushes they also clean well and dry well</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this set. They were delivered just this week (a little earlier than expected!) and I&#x27;ve already used several of the brushes. I really like how they come with a little pamphlet that lets you know what each brush is, perfect for beginners like myself. I was very pleased with the box they came in and the leather wrap. I don&#x27;t know if the leather is real, I doubt it but I can&#x27;t remember. However, it&#x27;s sufficient for my needs and looks nice enough. I&#x27;m really looking forward to experimenting with new make up techniques with them!</li>
    <li> These brushes are stiff, rough and the bristles fall out all over your face. I would not buy these again or recommend them.</li>
    <li> Nice looking and good</li>
    <li> For the price, these were good, but I meant to buy the $39.95 set with more angled brushes.  If I had it to do over again, I would.  But I decided to keep these because it would give me multiple eyeshadow brushes, and it was an amazing price.  Later, I&#x27;ll buy the other set too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew other reviewers said the storage bag stunk, so I cleaned it as soon as it arrived.  I also heavily washed and rinsed the brushes, because others said there could be shedding, and this would get rid of the loose hairs.  There is still some shedding afterwards, but it&#x27;s not bad at all.  I wish there were better brushes for contouring--the fan brush is too fluffy to be good for anything, it&#x27;s just as thick as the blush brushes.  A couple of the brushes were a little rougher than the softer synthetic brushes, but not bad.  Make no mistake, these are mostly synthetic brushes.  Only the larger ones appear to be natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find the bag or the brushes to smell that bad, but they did have a slight paint smell.  After washing and airing them out, it was fine.  I used elastic bands to attach the handles of the brushes to hangers, and hung them to dry, so the water wouldn&#x27;t sit inside the ferrule (the metal part where the hair is glued in), because that loosens the glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at the quality of the brush handles.  It&#x27;s really an amazing set for the price.  They wouldn&#x27;t compare to expensive brushes (some of the brushes had odd cuts) but for the price, the quality is outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t feel like any of the brushes were good for applying liquid foundation.  I have a five brush kit from Sephora that I use for that, with a semi-flat topped brush that is perfect for foundation.  I&#x27;m hoping that when I get the other Shany kit with the angled and flat topped brushes, that it will have a better option for foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great cheap starter set, and probably the perfect choice if you&#x27;re giving them to a teenager to experiment with.  If you can afford the $40 set, I suspect that might be a better choice, particularly for adults, but I can&#x27;t say for sure, since I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.ment with.

    <li> These brushes are great! I read some reviews about people having problems with these falling apart, but almost a year later, I haven&#x27;t had one fall apart in the least bit. I love these! (:</li>
    <li> ThiS brush set is just an extra set to have. I usually use MAC brushes for my every day personal use. I have tons of MAC eyeshadows. I like to do my friends and families makeup instead of always using my brushes, I found the brush set that I just purchased and they work just as good as the MAC brushes. The brush set came in a leather like case, each brush were individually wrapped in plastic, the stick of brush is a lil thick then what I expected. I would recommend these brushes to anyone looking for an affordable brush set.</li>
    <li> I LOVE ALL THE BRUSHES, ESPECIALLY THE FOUNDATION FAN BRUSH. THEY ARE ALL VERY SOFT, DENSE AND THE BRISTLES DON&#x27;T  FALL OFF. I GOT IT FOR A VERY LOW PRICE AND THAT IS A VERY BIG BONUS. THEY ARE ALSO VERY EASY TO WASH AND CLEAN. IT&#x27;S OVERALL AN AMAZING PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I never could get my eye shadow to look good when I put it on. I tried my new brushes and they worked! My eye shadow went on smooth and darker than normal and looked great without any effort!</li>
    <li> The brushes are so soft and gentle on the skin! I&#x27;m just very happy with this order and it was at a great price too!</li>
    <li> These brushes were an amazing purchase. They exceeded my expectations for the price, honestly. I&#x27;d definitely recommend them to a friend. Shipping was fast as well.</li>
    <li> They are good, but I had better. I bought these because I wanted to have a brush set. They are not as soft as I would like. My sister recently bought me a brush set from Coastal Set, and they are amazing. I would recommend Coastal brushes, they are much softer and about the same price.</li>
    <li> I love how well the brushes are made and they work great. However, the brushes were labeled on the ferol as to what type of brush it is. It would make it easier for a novice like me to identify the brushes a little easier.</li>
    <li> After a washing in baby shampoo to get rid of the chemical smell from the packaging and this set is great!</li>
    <li> THIS IS the best set of brushes i have bought and this is not my first !!! . love the roll out pack fits nice in my bag and the brushes wash up mnicely .. i ahve been uysing these for over a year and they still perform like new ..</li>
    <li> Brushes came packed well and individually wrapped, very soft and easy to clean. I am very happy with these and already purchased a second set.</li>
    <li> There was a great deal on these brushes around cyber Monday. They seem to be well made, and there is a brush for just about everything. Comes in a roll up carrying case, and sheet with descriptions of the brushes. Now what the heck do I do with all of them?!  ;-)  I don&#x27;t wear make up that much, but would like to do a better job of applying it when I do!</li>
    <li> Affordable, and how well, and easier to apply my make-up. It&#x27;s not over the top, but it does the job. Good quality product for afforable price. I love amazon, for many of it&#x27;s bargins.</li>
    <li> These brushes tend to poke at my skin and irritate it. They aren&#x27;t as soft and there&#x27;s always hair falling out from the brush head.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! Shipping was fast. These brushes are soft and fluffy. Very minimal shedding when I washed them. They work great.</li>
    <li> The brushes are very high quality (in my opinion) and I love the case. The case smelled like paint when it got her... It was kinda suspicious, but I liked the smell so it didn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
    <li> I must say that I do not fill my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;get out the hairs of the brush and get stuck to the face when im putting my foundation&lt;br /&gt;and theyre not so soft</li>
    <li> Really love this thing. My sisters and I watch YouTube videos every year for Halloween makeup ideas, and most of them require the brushes that are in this set. They&#x27;re really soft, even when firm, and I love the pouch they come in. Great product.</li>
    <li> bought them as a gift for my gf she loved them she uses them everyday the brushes are awsome they are super soft and i dont understand how all those brushes work but my gf does and i keep looking at her how she applies her make up and uses one and another brush and keeps on changing them and using them for different things, she loves them and its charmed by them so i doo recomend this set !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard mixed reviews about these brushes, but they&#x27;ve worked great for me so far! First off, I ordered them on a Sunday morning, they shipped the same day, and arrived on Monday morning. WOW! I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d even get them until Wednesday, but it was great service.&lt;br /&gt;I opened the package and the box was very nice. It had the leather roll with all the brushes inside and a booklet that explains what each is, and how to use them. Each brush was individually wrapped with plastic, and the bigger brushes had brush protectors (which is nice because now I don&#x27;t have to buy more). I took all the wrappers off and just inspected the brushes. They&#x27;re all numbered, so you can tell which is which in the aforementioned booklet. They are nicely put together, with no glue showing or any loose parts. There was definitely factory dust in them that flew out when I was feeling the bristles (that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s important to wash new brushes before using them for the first time). So, I gave them a good deep cleaning and let them dry.&lt;br /&gt;Now the real trial begins... the small brushes have little to no shedding, but the larger brushes shed a bit more. I would expect that, though, because there are so many little bristles packed in to each brush. They are so soft and work really well with dry and liquid products. I was a bit skeptical about using the liner brushes because they seem to be a bit flimsy, but they work perfectly! My only qualm with these brushes is that some of them have a gross animal smell (well, they are badger and goat hairs). I&#x27;m hoping that will go away with a few more deep cleanings. It doesn&#x27;t really bother me too much, though, because they do their job and don&#x27;t make my face smell like goat.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, these are great brushes. I used them recently for a wedding (I am NOT a professional makeup artist) in which I did my makeup as well as 3 or 4 other people&#x27;s. I just used a spot cleaning in between and they were good to go! All the people said they felt softon their faces, and we were all happy with the final outcome. Thanks, SHANY!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more brushes than I need for now especially for a basic look but I&#x27;d rather have more than what I need.</li>
    <li> It has everything you need but a blending and foundation brush. I had to go out and buy more but I think the rest is useful.</li>
    <li> Beautifull color exactly what I ordered cane very quickly, I ordered moré than expected and in happy about it, you will Not regret is the same as the picture</li>
    <li> The pakaging that the brushes came in was a little beat up. However, the the brushes were in perfect condition. I have just recieved them so I&#x27;m in the process of cleaning them. From their appearance the brushes are well and seem like a great quality.</li>
    <li> Amazing for the price. If you want inexpensive brushes, do it!</li>
    <li> Love this set its so worth buying</li>
    <li> The holder does have a bit of a paint smell but it is not over powering at all. Some of the brushes do have a little bit of loose hair but nothing major. I love all the brushes and everything.</li>
    <li> The only reason I got Shany brushes is for the fan brush. After reading the reviews, I thought it would a great to try. They have a great variety of brushes, but the goat hair are really really rough on skin. I haven&#x27;t seen much shedding so far.  The reason I am giving 4 Star ratings is because- the brushes arrived promptly after placing the order, the packaging is really good and makes a great gift, the leather roll up pouch is impressive and it comes with a description brochure on how to use each brush and the brushes are numbered, which makes it easier to put them back in the pouch.  Great for travel- but too harsh on skin for everyday use!  (If you are on a budget, I would recommend elf studio brushes. They are $3 each and comparable to the quality of Mac brushes)</li>
    <li> Bulk buying is a great way to save money and this is an awesome brand and product. I  will definitly buy again for our school!</li>
    <li> Light shedding but perfect! Natural smooth feel.</li>
    <li> I like all the different options of brushes.  The case it comes in is very nice too.  It&#x27;s probably more than you&#x27;ll ever need.  It&#x27;s just nice to have brushes available when you need them.</li>
    <li> A surprisingly high quality, and excellent variation of brushes for an up and coming model.&lt;br /&gt;Really liked to see how she lit up when she opened it.&lt;br /&gt;Good choice.</li>
    <li> The price on these brushes may seem exciting, but you get what you pay for. The brush hairs come out on the first use, its so annoying to have little black hairs all over. Also in my pack they gave me multiples of at least four of the same brushes. Save your money and invest in better quality brushes. The MAC or sephora brushes last years without loosing bristles. I will never again buy cheap brushes.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved her brushes. Great selection/variety.  Very good quality!!  Professional type. Thank you!!!! Will order from you again soon.</li>
    <li> I wish that I had learned a little bit about makeup brushes before purchasing these about a year ago. At this point, I haven&#x27;t used over half of them, and the ones that I have used shed all over my face and work poorly. Slowly as I&#x27;ve been learning, I&#x27;ve been replacing them one by one with quality brushes that are better suited to their purpose. These are just like their price: cheap.</li>
    <li> Great brushes... good quality for a great price. I bought a second set as a gift for my daughter and she loves them!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this set, great, she is happy!</li>
    <li> I recieved my brushes it was a set of 24 and it was a really nice leather case and all of the brushes were soft. The only small complaint that I have with them is that they shed just a little bit. but that is expected i guess with any brush sets that you have. It was a great deal and I will be buying them again.</li>
    <li> I love the amount and variety of brushes.  I thought that since these were made with real animal hair that they wouldn&#x27;t shed and leave me with hairs on my face.  Unfortunately that isn&#x27;t the case and I need to do a double check to make sure I don&#x27;t have dark hairs on my face before I leave for the day.</li>
    <li> After a good cleaning these brushes are amazing!!!!! I see what people mean by the hairs coming out but always CLEAN YOUR BRUSHES before first use and you&#x27;ll get longevity out of them. Super happy with how these are working.</li>
    <li> Did have a glue smell but went away. I love them for the most part</li>
    <li> These are a great buy for the price...I got them quickly this is most important to me! Will use seller again...I have never used there makeup...yet blush is on its way patiently waiting for the package to arrive. ..it should be here soon</li>
    <li> This set seemed like a good idea...but not really. Most of them look exactly alike and some of them shed. Good think I didn&#x27;t spend a lot of money on them. I&#x27;d give them a 2 1/2 stars if I could</li>
    <li> The lush brush is a little bill but wish it came with a regular blush brush. But other wise so many brushes that I haven&#x27;t used them all</li>
    <li> they are so soft and easy to clean only bad thing is they are not labeled overall very good buy</li>
    <li> these brushes are all right...  I read that they were soft and honestly it felt like semi-rough fur.. and yes, I did use a brush cleaner before testing it.  Out of the 24 brushes I use 3...  I know these brushes are very cheap... but for me, I would much rather use the elf professional brushes instead for about $3 per brush.  it is wayyyy softer and works very well.  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this brush set to a friend.</li>
    <li> My brother recently purchased the Shany Cosmetic Brushes for me for a Christmas present.  They arrived in a very timely manner and they are of high quality.  I am very pleased with my new make-up brushes, I use them everyday!!!</li>
    <li> I read some other reviews on here and people have talked about the strong odor of these brushes.  I honestly do not smell an odor on the brushes, I do smell it on the plastic case it comes with.  The smell is almost like the smell of cheap faux leather shoes or a cheap faux leather coat.  Not really a huge deal for me especially since I do not keep the brushes in the case.  I&#x27;ve had these brushes for about 6 months now and they have still held up really nice for the price!  I&#x27;d totally buy again!</li>
    <li> These brushes feel soft against my skin but the bristles stay in place for great makeup placement. It would be nice if they had a list of what each brush was designed for, but they are a great collection of brushes. They feel quality without costing an arm and a leg.</li>
    <li> For all the good reviews on this product, I was surprisingly disappointed.  There are not a lot of brushes in this kit that I consider unusable.  I do like the blush brushes, but that&#x27;s about the extent of it.  There is not a good brush in here for loose powder.  The eye brushes are all very thin.  I was really surprised at how thin they were, making application a bit difficult.  For as many brushes as come with this kit you would think there would be all kinds of angled brushes, etc.  Nope - there are a couple with a very slight angle, but nothing that would work for making, for instance, smokey eyes.  Overall I think it was a waste of money.  I got three decent blush brushes out of it but the rest are useless.</li>
    <li> They smell like chemicals and poor quality. I sent them back to the seller.</li>
    <li> Picky 13 year old fashionista daughter loves them....</li>
    <li> is crap&lt;br /&gt;first, I was excited when I received it, and eagerly wanted to use it to test.&lt;br /&gt;Great was my surprise when I began to use it because the bristles of the brushes off overdone, was a waste of time and money !!&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend them at all</li>
    <li> I bought them for my daughter...she really loves them!</li>
    <li> These brushes are very low quality.... the hairs feel so rough like a cheap water paint brushes... dont buy this ..</li>
    <li> I use them everyday. Make sure you get a good spray cleaner for them. Love them. Glad I bought the set.</li>
    <li> Shany Cosmetics has just earned themselves a customer for life!  Fantastic product, and for such a low price.  This kit has a brush for every need, brushes are soft, and apply makeup flawlessly.</li>
    <li> These brushes are a great investment and a great deal. I bet if you buy this you will not be sorry, you&#x27;ll probably have these for the rest of your life, because of the great quality.</li>
    <li> These brushes are ideal for people who are serious about getting the right look.  The leather pouch will also ensure that the brushes last for a long time, and will deliver the right, and desired look each time.  These are a must have for anyone who is serious about makeup.</li>
    <li> Bristles are not the color indicated, brushes are not numbered nor do they come in the correct order of their picture that names each brush for it&#x27;s use so their is no way of putting them in order, other than sight, and some brushes were missing with duplicates in their place. The leather case is nice.</li>
    <li> Hey these are awesome! There is a brush for every occasion and they are soft. I have been using these for almost a year now so I can say they also last a long time.</li>
    <li> The brushes were of excellent condition true to the description given.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glue of the box packaging was unstuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still presentable enough to wrap and give as a present</li>
    <li> The brushes feel like they are really good quality, they are very soft, not scratchy at all (doesnt irritate the skin) and I can tell they dont break easily. Zero hair fallout. Nice color and great bag.&lt;br /&gt;I think the fact that it says goat and badger set might scare some people away but I personally dont mind it at all. I would recommend this product to a friend. My only disappointment is that I wish the set came with blending brushes and foundation brushes, but for the price, what more can I ask for? Lol.</li>
    <li> the brushes are nice, there is a lot of fall out bristles when you first use them. I wish there was a wider variety of brushes, more concealing brushes, not just eyeshadow and blush. I love shaney cosmetics but the brushes were a little but of a let down. it&#x27;s a good set of beginner brushes but if you&#x27;re looking to widen your knowledge of beauty supplies, don&#x27;t buy them.</li>
    <li> cheaply made, I woudn&#x27;t recommend this</li>
    <li> A lot of doubles of the same type of brushes like brushes for eyeshadow and too many of the same blending brushes, should have more options. I should have took more time to chose a better set of brushes, the tops of the brushes are always coming off.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST PRICE OF BRUSHES I HAD IN MY LIFE!! i love it and i just got it!! i love to play with makeup and this do the job!!MUST BUY!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are worth the money. Easy to clean, even soft yet effective for makeup application. I recommend these brushes for anyone.</li>
    <li> I received these brushes, which are very good for what i need them for, but the &amp;#34;leather&amp;#34; pouch they come in is actually a very smelly vinyl that then stinks up the brushes. I went ahead and washes all the brushes and threw the pouch into the laundry and that seemed to help, but the manufactures of this product should rethink their materials as you could never used those brushes on anyone until they all have been washed and de-stinked.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves her brushes. A wonderful gift, that provides a flawless coverage and look. The pouch makes it easy to keep everything in order</li>
    <li> When reading the other reviews I thought these brushes would be better quality.  I was wrong.  I washed all of them when they were delivered and after each use they continually shed.  Truly disappointed!!</li>
    <li> I bought this set for theatrical make up! They work great easy to clean, the length of the brush is nice in the hand and the case is nice! great purchase.</li>
    <li> I got these because other brush sets are really expensive and I didnt have that much to spend. They work great, and are very soft. Only problem is out of the few brushes I use daily, one of them has already come apart. :( I am going to try to glue it back together, will see how it works. Overall happy with the product for the amount of money spent.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my granddaughter as a gift and she loves it! This makes a great gift for beauty-conscious women!</li>
    <li> The brushes was smooth, soft and reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;i like it.</li>
    <li> These brushes shed at first and as some other reviews have pointed out they do have a strong chemical smell.  However, when I first received them I washed each brush with gentle stop and that seems to tak care of the smell and the shedding. I even cleaned the case with soap and water which helped a lot with the smell too :) For the price of these brushes they are definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Not the quality I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I spent more than three hours to clean these brushes while watching Youtube video, but it didn&#x27;t seem work very well to me. I already throw away that funky and smelly little pouch long time ago, so this odor should not exist in this room still except these brushes. The worse thing is that the four of the big main brush hairs stick to my face continuously when I tried to makeup even though lots of hairs already fell off while cleansing those. I don&#x27;t know when it will stop falling out. I will see.</li>
    <li> Great for everyday use, brushes are soft and firm. However, the &amp;#34;pleather&amp;#34; case has a very overwhelming chemical/plastic smell and my #15 brush (lip brush) has dried glue on the tip.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves them. Great price for all the brushes u get.  Seem to be good quality but time will tell.</li>
    <li> I hate wasting my money, so I looked at several sets of brushes and read most of the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled with this set. As another reviewer suggested, I washed and conditioned them first. And I can say these are as soft as my MAC, Bobbi Brown, and other $$$ brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shedding was minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are wonderful brushes. I&#x27;m pleased with the quality and love the price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush set for over a year now and they are OK. The powder brushes shed quite a bit but do pick up a good amount of product, I just feel like I&#x27;m constantly getting the bristles off my face. As for the eye shadow brushes they are nice, pick up enough product however I wish they would have provided more of a variety, it seems a lot of them are the same brush just a different size. I am currently looking into getting a new set and I won&#x27;t be buying another one of Shany brushes.</li>
    <li> These Set Is Huge!!! Its Perfect for multiple types and stles of Cosmetic. I use Mineral types and thes are perfet for this use</li>
    <li> Brushes are soft and great to use. Granddaughter loved them. So did daughter. Best combined present ever. Merry merry Christmas.</li>
    <li> I chose the 3 star rating for prompt delivery and the look of the product. It arrived in a very reasonable amount of time and was in great condition. I lack 2 stars on the rating because I have yet to use the brushes for make-up application. Overall I am satisfied with the appearance and the sleek black look of the brushes. I have not experienced any fiber shedding from the brushes with initial touching at all.</li>
    <li> The brushes arrived on time and seem to be great quality.  However, I knew they were made in China before I even saw the packaging.  The smell was overwhelming when i first opened the box and I had to air them out before I could even look at the brushes.  Even after I washed them with my brush cleaner, twice, they still carried an odor.  If you are sensitive to smells, be aware.  If you aren&#x27;t, then these are really great brushes.</li>
    <li> A lot of shedding and a few fell apart after washing them. It drove me crazy having to pick little hairs off my face. I did love the leather case and use it for different brushes now</li>
    <li> awesome. way more professional than i expected. I feel like a real professional makeup artist. You should get some too.</li>
    <li> I needed brushes for my powder face make up and my eye shadow and liner.  The bigger brushes are too small for what I need them for but there is a huge variety of different eye make up brushes which have been more useful. Not the best product I have used, but not the worst either. If you need a really good set of makeup brushes these are not it.</li>
    <li> Cute pouch, nice set up, but the brushes themselves were not what i expected. The eye shadow brushes don&#x27;t apply eyeshadow very well at all. I used them once or twice to give them a chance but it just didn&#x27;t work. They are just too flat. The other brushes are okay i guess but it was the eyeshadow ones i was needing.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love it only because a few brushes have broke way too easy. But the brushes I have been able to fix and use constantly are amazing. Love it</li>
    <li> The Brushes Work Great And They Are Very Soft. I Love Them. It Gives You Alot Of Options To Choose From To Accomplish Your Look</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely great. My daughter did her makeup and said mom I am so glad you got these for me!! THANK YOU MOM!!!</li>
    <li> Very good value for money... soooo many brushes and more in one pack!</li>
    <li> Love my new brush set</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these for awhile, and they are still holding up. When you first get them, they do lose some of the hairs, but if you wash them, that will take care of it. You get many brushes without the crazy prices of some of the other name brand makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> I have this set at home but I also need to order a set to take with me when I travel. Great gift to give...or stocking stuffers</li>
    <li> The best brushes I&#x27;ve bought to date. They are very soft and none of the hairs fall out like some other brands. Comes in a nice roll out vinyl pouch. My daughter actually swiped a couple from me because she liked them as well.</li>
    <li> So for people who are starting with makeup or just need a real variety of bruses, these are good for you!!! The Shany Studio Quality Natural Cosmetic Brush Set with Leather Pouch, 24 Count are nice and soft brushes and you get a whole variety of brushes. The price is worth it and you get a leather pouch with it!!! This is a real good deal and this is really good for everyone who is starting makeup and curious on a variety of brushes :)</li>
    <li> I got all these brushes for under twenty dollars! Each brush is very soft! The pouch is leather which is very neat! I washed the brushes a few time, they work like new!</li>
    <li> However they had a quite pungent smell when first recieved. This of course fades when the brushes are washed, but when you put it in water to clean off excess makeup they smell even worse. Other than that they were quite satisfactory. There was minimal shedding. Another downfall of the product is that there was nothing to tell you which brush does what.</li>
    <li> I needed new brushes and I was a bit skeptical at first to buy brushes sight unseen but I decided to take a chance. I was glad I did. These are quality brushes with long handles in a pouch that is real leather. I love the case because it rolls up the brushes securely in a soft pouch that can be put in your suitcase like a roll of socks. The brushes themselves are made of quality animal hair and do not shed like other brushes do. I love the fan brush for my touch off of mineral veil as I use bare minerals makeup. I have bought quite a few brushes from the best of make up salons and these are the best yet. Everything they say about them is true and the best of all they are priced way below what they are worth. If I had bought these in a department store they would have cost me 5 times as much or more for the whole set. YOU will not be disappointed. Thanks Amazon for one great deal!</li>
    <li> these brushes are a great deal for the price. they shed and smell plastic-y at first, but after a deep cleaning or two, they stopped shedding and they smell fantastic!</li>
    <li> great item and fast delivery thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a beginner to the large variety of brushes and these are just what I needed. The price is great. Having these make me excited to do my makeup now.</li>
    <li> not very good quality your better off getting the RC brushes.</li>
    <li> I am such a novice when it comes to applying makeup. However, I do love the way the brushes allow you to blend the eye makeup better. It&#x27;s pretty much what I&#x27;ve used these for as I don&#x27;t do a lot of makeup. Especially, during my day to day routine. I usually only wear makeup for a special occasion, while I&#x27;m on vacation, or the weekends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these brushes, and I&#x27;m so glad I got them. I&#x27;ve yet to figure out what all of the brushes themselves do but I have a good idea on the ones I do use.</li>
    <li> I love the brushes! The plastic cover smells a little but, I aired it out and it was fine. This is a great buy. Delivery was fast and not one brush was damaged. I will buy more of these products..</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! the quality is great for the price. I find that these brushes are so soft and they work great. I would buy these again :)</li>
    <li> What i like most about this product is that it is cheap and their quality is great. Comparing from those branded brushes, the price for this you could only get like 1 brush but instead you&#x27;re getting 24 brushes.</li>
    <li> Decent for the price...they shed a lot though</li>
    <li> Stellar brush set! Got for daughter for Christmas.  Great quality.  Great selection.  Would re-purchase in a heartbeat!</li>
    <li> Love it, great product. Did not have problem with smell, it is just the plastic that it comes with.</li>
    <li> great set of makeup brushes!  glad I bought these after reading many reviews!  very satisfied!  great quality!</li>
    <li> The bristles started falling out the brush.&lt;br /&gt;When you apply makeup it doesnt pick it up that good. Cheap :(</li>
    <li> These are amazing brushes! Great quality and the bristles don&#x27;t come off upon applying makeup. Great price and quality- highly recommended from one experienced makeup snob to another :)</li>
    <li> i do not recommend these</li>
    <li> So first of I have to start by saying that I got this a while ago when I first started using makeup and now that its been a few years my personal preference now tends to lean towards synthetic brushes (these are all natural hairs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression was that they smelt funky but I have the same reaction with all brush sets---maybe its a standard factory kind of thing. These do shed a bit (especially the face brushes)but in a few washes this virtually never happens. The eye brushes are really great because they are really flexible, which is great for blending and most of them have withstood the test of time. lol.&lt;br /&gt;For the face brushes I only kept the fan brush because while the other brushes are usable and not scratchy, they tend to lose their shape over time. Overall, if you are just starting to get into makeup or if you want a whole bunch of eye brushes without investing in a lot of money, get this.</li>
    <li> My mom lovedd the brushes, definitely a good gift!</li>
    <li> Brushes are fair. They shed. But there are a 5 or 6 good brushes. I do makeup professionally so I&#x27;m quite picky on my brushes. Bought these when I first started doing makeup and still have a couple in my kit now. Some of the tops feel off ones I really didn&#x27;t like. But the others are pretty good still for an average person doing makeup and isn&#x27;t so crazy about make up.</li>
    <li> The brushes are very soft and apply make up very well this is a must have! I&#x27;m a make up stylist I recommend to everyone;) #NoBluff</li>
    <li> I guess I can&#x27;t complain since they were so cheap! You get a lot of brushes for the price. There were also two of some brushes which I found was really good since they were the \\&quot;staple\\&quot; brushes. These did shed a lot, but if you squirt nail glue into the brush from the bottom (like on the bottom only) it won&#x27;t shed ever again! They did have a smell to them... it kind of smelled like old spaghetti sauce? But I&#x27;ve cleaned them 3 times and the smell is still there.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product for people who are looking for a good priced set with a decent range of brushes. If you are a professional or semi-professonal I don&#x27;t think you will be satisfied. But for an beginner like me they are perfect. Some reviews say the stench is very bad and my set I got didn&#x27;t have much of a smell at all. The only smell was from the black ink of the bag. The brushes themselves only smelt from being stored in the bag and once I washed them the scent went away. I had some shedding but not very much. Once I cleaned them to get rid of the smell the shedding stopped as well. I am satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> this by far one of the most best sets of brushes ive bought! i thought about buying the mac brushes for $60 but this set beats it in a long shot. doesnt hold makeup. its soft. travel ready. there is a small paint smell but u cant really smell it unless you put ur nose to it but i actually like the smell. wish it was leather but its all good still handy. im still learning which brush is which but over u get your moneys worth and shipped very fast.</li>
    <li> This set of brushes is the best set ever!!! It rivals the most expensive set out there. Great quality and excellent finishes for any makeup user!! A must have set!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are wonderful! Don&#x27;t listen to the negative Nancy&#x27;s on this site.  I almost didn&#x27;t purchase because of some of the bad reviews I read, but now I am glad I did.  Just make sure you properly wash the brushes and condition, and they are great!</li>
    <li> I bought this after i saw the reviews and i must say that its a good buy for that price! i wasnt sure what to expect but when i opened the case, i was pleasantly surprised. the brushes are soft and did not pull off when i tugged hard. its a good must have for anyone looking for a good set of brushes!</li>
    <li> This is obviously for beginner artists and everyday use... i do not recommend for a professional to buy this cause they might think its shitty ...but to me as long as they do the job they are good i did not experience as much shedding as people said on the comment and video youtube reviews ( i had like one or two hairs fall of the bigger brushes REASONABLE) i think to be honest it is a steal....i have only one complaint ....my fan brush came bent in the package because it was probably shipped n placed where the crease of the bag is and is damaged... besides that though they all are looking great!!!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are fantatic.  They are natural hair, and well made.  They hold the makeup well and spread it evenly.  They clean very easily using baby shampoo and conditioner. The fold up pouch keeps them clean and organized.  I have always used brushes for my makeup and these bruses are fantastic.  So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any brustles falling out or handles coming loose.  The brushes appear toobe quality made.  Linda W.</li>
    <li> This a great deal if you&#x27;re looking to try new brushes. I think this is a great set to start with if you&#x27;re new to makeup (:</li>
    <li> Love this product-- a large variety of brushes and a handy organizer for those of us who aren&#x27;t the most organized. So far, this is an awesome value and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is a deal in so many ways! If i had tried to 24 of MAC&#x27;s Brushes it would cost me about 130 or more!</li>
    <li> I got these brushes today and let me tell you, they are really great high quality, the brushes are very soft and they did not shed whenever you felt them. At first though it had a smell like most brushes do, but once you deep cleanse them there will be some hair that sheds maybe like 4 pieces, but other than that the brushes are really amazing and they feel very soft, no dyes came off after the cleanse. I recommend deep cleansing them with a brush cleaner by e.l.f or if you don&#x27;t have that, you could also cleanse them with your foaming makeup cleanser/remover (cheaper).</li>
    <li> I love the quantity of prices and the steal of a deal I got on the Black Friday deals.  I wish the description/image for each brush was either etched onto the brush handle, or that the brochure was more detailed.  It is hard to tell which brush is for which purpose.  I&#x27;m not a pro at this but would like to learn to use the brushes for their intended purpose.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my girl  n she really liked the caraway of different brushes n she uses it quite frequently</li>
    <li> love this brushes looking to order another set for my daughter for xmas. They are soft easy to clean and the different tips make application a breeze.</li>
    <li> Great Product! I was surprised at the great quality for such an amazing price! I was expecting them to be nice, but they are a great quality brush. I LOVE them! Just what I had in mind :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes, for about 3 months. These are the best brushes, the natural bristles hold your product more, if that makes sense. Synthetic bristle tend to eat your product and you find yourself using more of your product. With the natural bristles, you won&#x27;t find yourself dipping 2 and three times into your product. These brushes are highly recommended for professionals and non professionals.</li>
    <li> These were a gift for a friend. She likes the natural bristles compared to synthetic. The leather pouch should keep them organized and protected. She looked at the way they are made and thinks they should last a while.</li>
    <li> The brushes are made from animal hair and that bothered me. I don&#x27;t recall the description saying they were made from animals. I returned the product the next day, but I was extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like almost all of these brushes. They fit my basic make-uping needs. These are basically my back-up brushes if I am feeling to lazy to clean my good ones.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend these brushes! I have yet to find any brushes that I really like until i found these! They&#x27;re soft brushes that don&#x27;t hurt or irritate your face or eye lids while you use them! I won&#x27;t use any other brushes now!</li>
    <li> Thank you so much I love them thank you for sending my replasment I&#x27;m very happy now it was very nice.</li>
    <li> For the price this set offers you a great deal and the brushes are not too bad quality. They are obviously no MAC brushes or anything but they do the job and do it well!</li>
    <li> This set is great for both makeup artist and armatures. The brushes are a nice texture. They are a great set for a beginner or a pro. The hair on the brush is soft but not so soft that it would cause you to have excess falling off of it. It does not leave excess hair from the brush they are all firmly made. The case they come in is a nice quality. I was quite pleased with the case also. Def recommend this</li>
    <li> a great cheap full set of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;most do shed which is annoying, but the brushes still feel nice and do the job.</li>
    <li> I bought these for 2 reason; 1 they were on sale and 2 they had good reviews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;once i got them I was super excited to open them and use them until i picked one up...&lt;br /&gt;they were soft and felt super durable and then i notice every time i touched them they&#x27;d shed! they don&#x27;t hold any products and they aren&#x27;t even shaped properly</li>
    <li> These are great if you are wanting a lot for a little, but because of that, don&#x27;t expect them to be perfect.  Some of the brushes shed... A lot.  The &amp;#34;leather&amp;#34; case smells and is cheaply made, and mine was missing a brush.  They are cheap so don&#x27;t order them and expect them to be without issues.  If you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot and want them to last long enough to buy some better ones then these will work</li>
    <li> I am new to doing my make-up and have found that these brushes help me do a better job each time.  A few of the brushes seem like duplicates, but I just look at it as I have &amp;#34;extras&amp;#34; just in case</li>
    <li> I can not wait to use this set of cosmetic brushes... They are what I have always wanted to get the perfect look....</li>
    <li> I received these as a Christmas gift so I cannot speak to the speediness of the shipment or the long-term quality of the brushes, but as of right now I am in love with them. They are very true to the description, soft, easy to clean (if you do it properly), and of course they apply my make-up with ease. They don&#x27;t seem like the kind of brushes where the bristles would fall out, but only time will tell. As of right now I am extremely satisfied and would highly recommend this brush set to anyone.</li>
    <li> there not horrible but not great either.&lt;br /&gt;first thing i noticed was hairs coming off the brushes, they werent in order and the strong oder.&lt;br /&gt;they did come in time and there are a lot of them.&lt;br /&gt;i dont think i will even use half of them, dont know why i got such a big brush set.&lt;br /&gt;i dont think i would recommend this to a friend but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Great product, nice natural brushes, come in a tidy packaging so they don&#x27;t get make up everywhere in your bags etc.</li>
    <li> I have had had natural brushes before, but these are great. I received these as a gift, and they are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great set for beginners who need an affordable set to learn which brushes do what task, and how to properly store them.</li>
    <li> I am always on the prowl for quality makeup brushes at a good price. Shany has given me exactly that. I consider these brushes top of the line &amp; have them scattered throughout my makeup kit. I like them better than some of the more expensive brands I&#x27;ve purchased even. i recommend these to clients,friends &amp; family...even strangers. If you want the best at the best price look no further than Shany!</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes for my daughter. She is very happy with them. They are well done and the price is also reasonable.</li>
    <li> Nice BRUSHES... love the actual texture of the goat hair , but was expecting a variety of brushes. Did not include a blending brush, or several other brushes. But does have several sets of the same brush. Along with my old set, and a few brushes I have picked up separately I have pretty much what I need now.... Was a let down that they duplicated several brushes and did not include essential brushes. Would be a perfect set if they would correct the duplication of so many brushes, and include essential brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! I will never buy from another company again! This kit has all the essential brushes. Great for a beginners and pros.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love! these brushes. I had purchased the Shany 13-piece brush set last year and couldn&#x27;t get enough of them - literally! Which is why I bought these. I wanted to compare this \\&quot;studio\\&quot; set to the \\&quot;professional\\&quot; set.. and I also wanted a wider variety of brushes. These brushes are soft and sturdy. They pick up a good amount of pigment without caking it on. This set includes basic brushes and also what I call \\&quot;special\\&quot; brushes (for the brush-freaks like me) that most people don&#x27;t use every day. The only problem I had with a few of the brushes is that with heavy use occasionally a hair will come out, but hopefully that won&#x27;t happen often.</li>
    <li> I just started beauty school and I did not want to spend a lot of money on Mac or any other expensive brushes. I have ordered from shany before and never had a problem and the same goes for these brushes. I have no complaints, the work great and I saved money .</li>
    <li> Great quality of the product, brushes are just amazing, soft. the set has everything for creating a great make up fast n easy. and i got it much sooner,  2 days after i made an order</li>
    <li> The brushes are great for the price you pay... they are all soft and you get your value for your money which I think its awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting the package in 10 more days or so and I got it today which makes it even more great!! I totally recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are alright, i found i had a lot of problems with the blush brushes shedding they do get the job done however, but with just a little hassle.</li>
    <li> Granted this is my first set of brushes, but as a mom of 3 I neither have the time nor the money to really invest in hundreds of dollars worth of brushes. Yet I wanted to have something to make me feel more girly, I have all boys! I ordered these and I LOVE getting them out and playing with them when I do get the chance to put makeup on. I love that they are in a case, it makes me feel special. And as far as quality, I&#x27;ve noticed a couple hairs here and there the first time I used them, but that&#x27;s it!! I don&#x27;t notice a really bad odor like others have said. Not that they couldn&#x27;t use a good freshening up ha, but not bad. It is a beautiful set. I have had compliments on my makeup. My husband says something anytime I put it on and that never happens as he doesn&#x27;t care for makeup usually. So something is working. So many different brushes. Personally the ONLY thing I would like different, is less \\&quot;face\\&quot; brushes and more eye brushes, but that&#x27;s simply because I do not use blush or anything like that..... That being said, the liner brush is wonderful!!! I highly recommend, AND it came with a coupon for the next purchase so that&#x27;s always a plus!!!</li>
    <li> Great deal, i think these compare to high end brushes.  They are very soft and pick up color very well.  I am in love with these, def will purchase more for my collection.</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes on the 11/19 and received them today! AWESOME! i of course have not been able to use these brushes yet but just from looks and feel alone they seem to be pretty nice</li>
    <li> I love it, the brushes are so soft and the case has good size, it&#x27;s perfect to carry travel.</li>
    <li> The brushes feel really soft and I can&#x27;t wait to try to figure out how to use each one.  They are better than I expected and of better quality than the price would suggest.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very soft; I like them a lot. I only gave 4 stars because of the smell. I washed the brushes once but it wasn&#x27;t enough; a 2nd wash did the trick. I also tossed the carrying case because of the smell. Cheap plastic will always smell like cheap plastic. If I need to take them anywhere I&#x27;ll just use a zip-lock bag.</li>
    <li> I was super excited to get my brushes. 24 brushes for this low price, plus majority of the reviews were good! I was a little dissapointed with the varitey of the brushes, some of them seemed to be similar and I felt some brushes were missing. I have purchased some single brushes from Sephora and from Elf that I didn&#x27;t even see in this collection.&lt;br /&gt;They aren&#x27;t as weighty as I would like them to be.  The ones from Sephora and Elf had a weight to them and seemed to pick up and hold the color better.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I just need to get use to them. Don&#x27;t get me wrong they are not terrible. They are just ok.&lt;br /&gt;I do love the pouch they came in. There is even space for me to add the brushes I already have!</li>
    <li> Honestly, I thought these brushes would be a lot better. First of all, the pouch is not leather but it is a neat brush pouch. The brushes are really soft and they pick up well but they shed and are a bit loose.</li>
    <li> Another great stylish brush case with so many brushes for all your needs. They are so soft.The price is so right and inexpensive for such quality.</li>
    <li> I have had my brushes for over a year and they do not show their age.</li>
    <li> 24 quality make up brushes for a great price, They took extra care in packaging each brush wrapped up in plastic. Love the case that came with these it rolls up, so these are easy to store. I am very pleased with this product and will be ordering from them in the future!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but there is grid of brushes on the booklet but they do not resemble the set so it is very hard to know which brush is which. Be nice if they would of numbered or something like most brush sets do.  UGH</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend who&#x27;s going to cosmetology, and she loved it! Said the quality was really great, and the range of brushes was fantastic for a beginning set. Very happy.</li>
    <li> A very wide selection of brushes with decent quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About three weeks into owning the product, one of the wooden handles came apart from the brush. To me, nothing major.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used crazy glue to put this back together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, great for the price.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased to finally have enough brushes to do everything that I can imagine and things I haven&#x27;t even thought of before thank you so much .</li>
    <li> Great brushes I have ordered these before in the twelve set and then ordered the off brand pink set (32) after a few uses of the pink set I found they are not good so I came back to what I know the shanty set great quality for a professional finish and a great price so don&#x27;t waste your time with those other brushes go with shany</li>
    <li> Good purchase for the price. They get the job done and the quality is pretty good. I would recommend them.</li>
    <li> Surprised my wife with this affordable cosmetic set.  Comes with a nice compact pouch and has a great assortment.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;cant beat the quality at this price.</li>
    <li> This was bought as a gift for my daughter who is in Theater across the nation.  She said it was great!!</li>
    <li> Best quality for low price!</li>
    <li> honestly you get what you pay for a few of them have lasted a while with minimal shedding but most of them shed like no other and not only that a few came apart with very little use</li>
    <li> Soft and doesn&#x27;t fall out on your face like cheaper brushes do</li>
    <li> These brushes are bomb! I was a little skeptical when purchasing them because I thought they may be too good to be true - boy was I wrong! These brushes are fantastic! This is a perfect set of brushes, especially for those just starting out with makeup or looking to build their collection. You can do your entire face just with this set. They apply the make-up smoothly and are a breeze to clean. The leather case makes traveling with them easy and hygienic. They are great quality and at that price, you just can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> I couldnt wait for my brushes to arrive and when it did ..it was worth the wait. I love these brushes.Theyre soft on my eyelids and pick up the shadow really well. I even bought a set for my 2 sisters because theyre good and are not so expensive .I was worried after reading reviews about shedding ,and a bad fragrance or what not. But I didnt have the same experience .I love these brushes</li>
    <li> Arrived and smelled very strongly of chemically plastic... Had to throw the case away, smell was so strong. Brushes are cute. Would be good for a teenager or young adult.</li>
    <li> This set of shany brushes are very soft and the quality is very good.  These are affordable brushes that is good for your make up kit.  these will be great for those of you that are getting into make up and to want to spend alot on make up brushes.  I recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> My wife is a pro make up artist and I got these as a gift for her ,The quality versus price is unbelievable ,she told me they were as good as Mac , very soft ,specially for pro&#x27;s in this business . No funny odor and the box prfesentation is very classy . She is a happy camper and they made me look good ,thank you Shany!</li>
    <li> I received these as a gift. The eye/smaller brushes are very useful, but the ones for face are not soft. They shed too. Not a total waste of money by any means, but some of the brushes are just not even worth using at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my niece who loves doing make up and is going to be pursuing doing make up as a career this set was exactly what she needed and suggested as a must have on her materials list but this was a way better price than the suggested ones. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I do not have much experience with make up so i thought i would splurge and go big and purchase these brushes. They arrived on time, no complaints there.  Each brush had its own cover and they even included a guide letting you know which brush does what job.  Since the arrival of these brushes I have also ordered Shany eye shadow pallettes and love playing around, trying new styles I never would have attempted before.  I even ordered a set of brushes for my mom and a eye shadow kit. A surprise so I think we will be the most doozied up women in church lol. Until I quit making attempts to mimic what I see on youtube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote: A previous reviewer mentioned the new pencil smell. Well i would hope they have a new smell, i want them new.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes it&#x27;s worth the money!!!! I will be shopping for his brand more!! They have so much variety I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d get so much brushes!!!</li>
    <li> I love it. It was worth buying . I am able to develop a flawless look using different brushes. Especially, smokey eyes.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes.I don&#x27;t have a problem with any shedding if the hairs. I just wish instead of numbers they would have the name if the brush on the handle. I&#x27;m not a MUA, and I don&#x27;t wear make up to often so I forget what each brush is for.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the money.  I only use about 1/2 of them, but for the price I don&#x27;t feel cheated.</li>
    <li> I would give this 10 stars if I could I do make up and these perform better than my high end ones..</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve had my SHANY makeup brushes for two weeks and thought that I gave enough time to give a fair review.  I&#x27;ll start by saying that I am not a professional but I am a makeup enthusiast and I think for that for what I need them for, they are good. The brushes are soft and there is a wide variety of sizes.  Most of the brushes are geared towards the eyes. A lot of the brushes for eyes are a little too big to use on the eyes and end up being a little awkard but there is a good selection and most likely for everyday makeup uses you&#x27;ll find a brush that suits your needs. The one complaint I have about the brush selection is that there is no kabuki.. I ended up using one of the larger blush brushes for foundation application and it actually works out quite well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;d like to reply to some common complaints and comments I saw among other reviewers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far and the case goes.  It is NOT real leather.  The case is made of some type of vinyl and does indeed smell pretty bad.  What I did was remove all the brushes and just stood the case up in the window over night to air out.  The smell went away...problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On that note, I read a lot of people say the brushes smell bad.  I did not think so at all.  They may have slightly taken on the smell of the case but once they were washed it was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of washing the brushes, I also read a lot of reviewers complain about bristles falling out.  Now, it is beauty 101 that when you wash your brushes you are NOT supposed to get the base wet.  This will case problems with even the best of brushes as it causes weakening.  To get around this I simply grip the base of the brush when I&#x27;m running them under water, using my whole hand for large brushes and the tips of my fingers for smaller brushes (for the super small ones, I don&#x27;t bother).  Lather with a gentle face wash and rinse.  Then lay them out on a paper towel and let them dry overnight.  I have not had and trouble with fallout.  A couple strays here and there, but nothing major.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a starter kit, I think this set is great.  I do plan on slowly purchasing some better quality versions of the brushes I use the most.  But this is a great supplement to any makeup lover&#x27;s collection.  And for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I returned this product, I ordered it because the site claimed to be animal friendly. When I received it, I learned that the brushes were made from animal fur! No thank you!</li>
    <li> There are a lot of brushes but as I should have known the quality is not that great. Some are better than others .</li>
    <li> Excellent product, responsible delivery, the product is of excellent quality I recommend it, from venezuela</li>
    <li> I bought this because the reviews were great, and I needed brushes that I could purchase in a set so I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy loads from various places. It was also nice that it came with a leather pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had waited for Coastal Scents brushes to come back in stock because I wasn&#x27;t happy with these. They shed like crazy! I can&#x27;t go without bristles all over my face when doing my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely don&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
    <li> It has a huge selection of brushes. Sometimes tho the little hair things come out onto my face. I guess I&#x27;m going to wash them and see if that helps.</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes months ago &amp; I am still loving them.  I love them enough to say that I would definetely buy a brand new set.  They are easy to wash &amp; whats best is that even after you wash them they feel softer for some reason.  A woman needs to have a ton of brushes for her make-up &amp; these are inexpensive &amp; good quality</li>
    <li> Oh my god these brushes are incredible!!!!!! For one brush at a department store is double the price then this set and you get like 20!!!!! They have not shedded bristles at all. Their wonderful and the case is great too.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great, super soft and very well made! :) If you&#x27;re looking for a makeup brush set then I recommend this one. You can;t beat the price for the quality!</li>
    <li> My husband got these for me as a birthday gift nearly two years ago. I was really excited when I received them. I admittedly washed them so I could use them the next day. The second I washed them they shed like crazy and the shedding never stopped! I used them for two years in hopes that maybe it would stop and it never did. I would constantly have little pieces of brush hairs on my face that I would constantly have to pick off and any time I washed them a million brush hairs would wash down the drain. Not only that but the &amp;#34;leather case&amp;#34; is more of a plastic. Reading the reviews on here they really seem like quality brushes (and I know my husband read them before he purchased these) so it makes me really sad that the product we got wasn&#x27;t what was expected or paid for. I don&#x27;t recommend these but it appears others have had better luck with this product.</li>
    <li> These brushes are wonderful!  There&#x27;s a ton to play with and create different looks.  They are also easy to clean.  I would recommend these to any makeup artist starting out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with my order. I&#x27;m just starting out with the brush thing. I have been using one brush for everything. Now that I have a new set I get to explore. My package came sooner than I expected. Can&#x27;t wait to try them out!!!</li>
    <li> I wish I could say these brushes are \\&quot;Studio Quality\\&quot; as advertised but I have no idea if this is true or not. What I do know is that these are a good deal for my personal needs and have made putting on make-up and experimenting with make-up fun again.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever ordered make up brushes. I&#x27;ve done a tone of research on the best brushes to buy and what to look for as of quality. After doing weeks of research I decided to order these brushes from Shany Cosmetics. I was pretty excited to receive these and start using them. They came pretty quick in the mail. It came nicely wrapped in a leather case. All the brushes were so soft and the quality was great. I&#x27;ve used cheaper brushes before but I can tell these weren&#x27;t poorly made. I them went through all of the brushes and decided that its too much for me. 24 pieces is a lot of pieces for a person who doesn&#x27;t know much about make-up. I&#x27;ve decided to give them to a friend who knows how to use each brush. I will definitely be looking for a smaller brush set from this company. If you know a lot about make-up and the uses of each brush this will be the perfect set for you.</li>
    <li> I used to pay big bucks for MAC brushes but these are just as good. It&#x27;s just missing the liquid foundation brush. I would substitute the eyebrow brush for the liquid foundation brush. All in all it&#x27;s really worth it!!!!! I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I bought it when I first started makeup. As long as I do makeup and skin care thing, I feel the importance of a good makeup tool.You could buy it if you just wanna play for fun from time to time, but definitely invest your money on brushes with better qualiy, like shiseido and bobbi brown. You pay what you get.</li>
    <li> i was really curious about these brush and i took the risk... the shipping came really quick and in great condition.... im very happy with my purchase and not just that the brush are really great they pick up the makeup... with these brush you apply the the makeup right on.. and also i got for a really great price&lt;br /&gt;... really happy</li>
    <li> Great brush set!  Very soft bristles.  Very minor shedding so far.</li>
    <li> Good price for the number of brushes you get.  However, even after washing with shampoo the larger brushes have a problem of the hairs coming out when you use them which is aggravating since they stick to your face.</li>
    <li> THEY ARE GOOD FOR THE PURPOSE, BUT OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE NOT HIGH QUALITY.</li>
    <li> So unhappy with these brushes. They are made out of camel hair wich is sooo not soft on the skin !!</li>
    <li> Love it ! It doesn&#x27;t shed !! The fact that it&#x27;s in its own little carrying case, is so convenient ... I carry it everywhere !!!!</li>
    <li> Honestly the brushes suck when you compare them to Mac and sephora pro brushes. I bought this mostly for the roll up case because it holds 25 brushes, I figured there would be a couple brushes I would use. Most brush roll ups that hold 25 brushes will run you $20+ easily, so really you are getting the brushes for free in my opinion. They are not horrible. But for doing professional makeup I would not recommend. For your eyes splurge on the only two brushes you really need, the 239 and a blending brush like #217. For your face I recommend the sephora pro angled blush brush #49, the sephora precision powder #59, the sephora pro flawless light powder brush #50, and of course the Mac 187 stippling brush. These have worked lovely for me. I also highly recommend the beauty blender sponges that you slightly dampen to blend foundation for beautiful streak free build able coverage. Hope this helps:)</li>
    <li> Compre esto como regalo para alguien que gusta del maquillaje y quedo complacida, el producto es muy bueno y de excelente calidad.</li>
    <li> First of all, this brush set is super soft. The bristles of the brushes are so much softer than my essence of beauty ones, and so much cheaper! There are a few things you should know if you get this set.&lt;br /&gt;1) There is no liquid foundation brush. There are a few powder brushes if you use powder foundation, but there is not a foundation brush.&lt;br /&gt;2) There are A LOT of eyeliner brushes! I don&#x27;t use eyeliner much, but when I do these brushes are really nice. Still, if eye makeup/eyeliner isn&#x27;t your thing, you might think twice about buying these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m so pleased with these. They are really pretty and professional looking, really really really soft, and are easy to clean. Very few &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; incidents with the big brushes, perfect for every need!</li>
    <li> This product is assorted brushes for any and everything you need in a make up bag. This arrived on time. These brushes is a great buy for a great price. I love them and use them everyday</li>
    <li> It is a great brush set, the carrying product is very nice and include how to use the brush. I recomend with confidence</li>
    <li> This product is good quality brushes for an awesome price. I would recommend this product to anyone who applies makeup on a daily basis. This was a gift to my sister and she loves them.</li>
    <li> This was my first professional makeup brush set, and overall I&#x27;m very happy with it. The one thing I was surprised about when i received it was that there is no foundation brush included in the set, which was something I was looking forward to, but didn&#x27;t neccessarily need. Delivery was quick, and overall a very good item.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this item is described as having a &amp;#34;Leather Pouch&amp;#34; - NOT TRUE!!!  The brushes are mediocre - okay for personal use only.</li>
    <li> Well, like everything I buy, I fully read the reviews for these before I purchased them.  After reading the review where the lady instructed to deodorize and deep clean these, I did just that.  I am happy to say not only do they smell wonderful, they are the softest brushes I have ever used.  They are on par with any top dollar brushes I have ever used in both quality and softness.  I am very glad I purchased them now.  They do not shed after taking the time to clean these as instructed, as well.  I doubt I will ever purchase another ridiculously priced brush again.  If you need instructions on how to do the neccessary care to these items, please look on YouTube for lots of help.  I doubt if you do these few steps that you will be disappointed with your purchase either.  Defintely a product where you got plenty of bang for your buck!  I am extremely excited about this purchase because I would have never been able to afford this array of tools without this kind of price.</li>
    <li> I have had these brushes for almost a year and they are horrible. These brushes shed like nobodys business. When i am done applying my foundation i have to check and see how many hairs are on my face. It is bad. At this point, i&#x27;m actually going to just throw them away and save for mac brushes. This was a waste of money considering the amount of times i&#x27;ve had to take my makeup off and reapply because i have loose hair on my face.</li>
    <li> Minimal shedding good quality . the brushes are soft and the variety and selection of brushes is very adequate. you ewill definitely find all the brushes you need.</li>
    <li> When I received my package I was inpressed with how it was packaged. I will be ordering other items for shred!</li>
    <li> I FEEL LIKE A PROFESSIONAL ! I got these and immediately i said i have to leave a review ,  i havent used them as yet but ill do an update review. The brushes are look and feel like high quality brush , the price and the quality packing of these products was definitely  a steal of a deal . I love every single one of the brushes not to mention the leather black bag makes me look like im ready for a makeup contest</li>
    <li> As I read from other reviews, I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the smell, and my pouch that came wasn&#x27;t real leather, but it wasn&#x27;t poor quality. I did wash and condition them before I used them, and they feel great! Soft, solid and very useable. I love the many different brushes and am very excited about getting the chance to use them all. Get them, for the price you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love how soft the brushes are! I bought this set because I needed new make up brushes and it came with a pouch. The pouch and brushes look professional. You definitely get more than your money&#x27;s worth with these. good quality, really good price.</li>
    <li> i love these brushes! i use them everyday (:</li>
    <li> This product is cheap with agreeable quality. It&#x27;s not made with real animal hairs, but with a price like this it&#x27;s already good enough. In general it worth buying.</li>
    <li> good brushes for the price a lot of my friends want to buy them now because they are good brushes the case is a little cheap but that&#x27;s not what I paid for.</li>
    <li> Great brushes the bristles fall out quite a bit. I have had these over a year and they are still going strong.</li>
    <li> quality perfect. i love that, is amazing. im so happy for this shopping. thanks a lot. i recomend too much.</li>
    <li> I am not happy with the larger brushes at all!!!  I&#x27;ve had them for about 2 months now and they are still consistently SHEDDING!!!! When I&#x27;m puttin on my makeup and when I&#x27;m cleaning them, it&#x27;s just nonstop shedding and I&#x27;m extremely upset about this... I read the reviews before I purchased this as I did all kinds of other reviews... The reviews I read for these brushes are what made me buy them... All I have to say is the REVIEWS ARE DEAD WRONG!!!!!  Sounding a bit dramatic and harsh, but I honestly don&#x27;t care!  Maybe I got the rejects of the bunch, but I&#x27;m highly ticked!  I recommend, to NOT PURCHASE THESE BRUSHES!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I received my brushes today &amp; I must say I&#x27;m very pleased. The delivery was rather quick and it came nicely packaged. Upon opening the brush set it did have a smell to it as other purchasers had described, but it was very faint and not overpowering. I rubbed my brushes to get a feel for them and they&#x27;re very soft &amp; I did not experience any hairs fall off...yet. The brushes come numbered with a little manual to describe what each brush is used for. No it doesn&#x27;t come with a foundation or blending brush, but I knew that prior to ordering this item. I tested out some brushes using my UD Naked2 palette &amp; the makeup sticks great to the brushes. Overall I&#x27;m really satisfied with my purchase &amp; you can&#x27;t beat the price; it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
    <li> This is my first set of makeup brushes, so I don&#x27;t have a lot to compare them to.  They seem good enough.  As recommended in some of the other reviews, I washed them when I got them.  Even still, every now and again a hair falls out.  They&#x27;re good, but I get the feeling there are probably better feelings ones that don&#x27;t shed as much out there... but maybe not for this price!</li>
    <li> It is a very complete set and im very happy with my purshace i will recoment this product for sure</li>
    <li> I received my brushes today and I was ecstatic! I fully intended on giving Shany a rave review, 5 stars plus. The quality of these brushes are awesome, really. Incredibly soft, you&#x27;ll be applying makeup like a pro in no time. Unless...despite what the description says this set did NOT include a foundation brush! So, I go on their website, thinking maybe that&#x27;s not so unusual. They have a blog stating the importance of brushes, with a list of 8 most important brushes; #1:FOUNDATION BRUSH!!! I KNOW RIGHT!? So, while I love the quality of this set, I cannot overlook the fact that a 24 brush set did not include at least one foundation brush.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter and she love these products, women are forever painting there faces to look better.</li>
    <li> First review: My items arrived quicker than excepted, the brushes were just as picture, all 24 nice and in the case. Each brush was wrapped in plastic and easy to wash. I didn&#x27;t however receive the paper telling me what each brush was used for but other than that the brushes were great. I&#x27;ll leave although review once I&#x27;ve used the brushes</li>
    <li> I simply love these brushes.  Like many have mentioned in several review you need to wash the brushes prior to use.  You&#x27;ll be amazed of the dye.  They are so soft!!!  Because I have highly sensitive skin, I love to take these with me to photo shoots to ensure that brushes are not shared between models.  The Makeup Artist can&#x27;t believe the quality of the brushes.  I used them daily and love that they are numbered (so easy to ensure that all are accounted for).  In addition, the numbered brushes coincide with the pamphlet that detail the use for each brush - in case you are not a professional.  I&#x27;m happy with the quality and price.  Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I got these brushes for my sister, who wears blush, foundation, eye shadow, etc. most days. This is the perfect kit for her, possibly even overkill, because it has many many brushes and they all stay in a tidy, roll up kit! Other reviewers (the serious makeup people) have said that you MUST wash them with brush shampoo before using, but I just washed them with water and let them dry and had zero problems whatsoever with any hairs or black powder coming off and ruining my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;For $17, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with these brushes.</li>
    <li> First time trying Shany products and I luv it and a very reasonable price and I&#x27;ll be purchasing more Shany!!!</li>
    <li> Shany brushes are great quality just that the brush is a little prickly besides that these are good brushessome of the brush bristles came a lil bent on the fan brush 😡</li>
    <li> I bought a set for myself and loved them so much bought one for my daughter.  They are made out of Badger hair.  Usually these types of brushes stick you when you are putting on blush or powder.  These don&#x27;t.  And OMG all the different sizes of eye brushes.</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t the best quality but for the price I really can&#x27;t complain. The smaller brushes are excellent for nail art as well!</li>
    <li> Little shedding and a little smell but they&#x27;re wonderful I love them!</li>
    <li> I used these brushes every day.  I did go and add a blending brush and foundation brush; however, this set is really great.</li>
    <li> gets the job done if you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on higher quality brushes.</li>
    <li> So after reading all the good and bad reviews on these brushes, I decided to give it a try. First of all, they arrived three days earlier than expected. Second of all, the odor everyone complaints about is actually not so bad, the smell is actually of wet paint and eventually after having them in a ventilated place it&#x27;d wear off. Third of all, the shedding on these brushes are not so bad. Honestly that was the main thing I was the most worried about, but surprisingly when I opened the package only a couple hairs were loose on some brushes,  but other than that the brushes are overall good. What I also like was that they each brush was numbered and came with a sheet that gives a brief description of each of their uses. The packaging is also a plus.&lt;br /&gt; I will definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love my brushes. They are not cheap. I would buy more of this product. They apply the makeup just fine.</li>
    <li> Just okay. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> great product and super fast shipping!! love it!!</li>
    <li> While some of the brushes are nice they shed ALOT and there&#x27;s no foundation brush, blending brush and the eye shadow brushes are thin not really what I expected.</li>
    <li> very good for the price! i love them. there a great for starter or even if your more advanced people! you just need to wash them cause they stick and the fan brush is way to big and gets kinda bushy after your wash it! hope you love it!!!</li>
    <li> i ve just receive them!! i didn&#x27;t try them but it seems really good product and they came a lot!!!&lt;br /&gt;thank you!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use half these brushes. The quality sucks!</li>
    <li> Pros: Great range of brushes for everyday makeup Cons: Hair comes out of brushes and not very useful for professional makeup as they fall apart quickly.</li>
    <li> I do not like this brush set. After one wash the bristles were sticking out everywhere.</li>
    <li> Not impressed! I bought this set and was so excited to use it! When the brushes arrived, 1 brush was missing a head and several had hairs sticking out all over. The quality was just not there, so I had to send it back.</li>
    <li> Birthday gift for my daughter . She loves to do dramatic makeup and loves all of the different effects she can create with these.&lt;br /&gt;They seem like nice quality brushes and the case is great too.</li>
    <li> Love the variety of brushes with such a great price! Remember to air out the brush purse because it does have a distinct smell. Also, remember to wash the brushes before using ;) I highly recommend the product to all my girlfriends.</li>
    <li> When I first received the brush set, even before opening it, I thought that it would be the typical cheap set (for the price, who wouldn&#x27;t think so). But I was wrong! I really liked the brushes, they are soft, work great, and are an awesome starter brush set!</li>
    <li> If your looking for a good set of brushes that will last you a long way. I highly recommend Shany Studio Quality Natural Cosmetic brushes. Not to forget the cute cosmetic leather pouch that comes along with the brushes. I must say this was a buy for me. I love how this line makes quality brushes at an affordable and easily attainable price. The brushes pick up just that right amount of make up and do not loose their fluff once cleansed and washed. You must purchase a set for yourself to see what I am talking about.</li>
    <li> All of the brushes in this set are flat brushes. the small brushes are nice, but the larger brushes are very scratchy, even after cleaning them all. These are not professional brushes, but I still use the smaller brushes everyday.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for a couple of weeks now, and I&#x27;ve had no problems with them at all. I took another reviewer&#x27;s advice and shampooed them before using, and saw only about 5 loose hairs from the whole set. The only brush which I don&#x27;t find so good is the small angle brush... it&#x27;s a bit too thick and soft for fine lines. (I recommend the Natio angle brush if you&#x27;re looking for a good one). Overall, these brushes are exactly what I expect from good quality makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought many sets of brushes over the years and I&#x27;ve never found value like this.  The brushes are wonderful, soft and easy to handle, come in a lucious roll-up pack (I do a lot of traveling so I especially appreciate that feature), and there are so many of them!  If you&#x27;re thinking about new make-up brushes, don&#x27;t pass these up!</li>
    <li> these brushes are wonderful! i purchased them and i was shocked with the quality of them! I wanted the mac brushes but these were worth the money! defiantly recommend them!</li>
    <li> I jut received my pakage today &amp; opened the box, yes the odor of the leather pouch is strong, but I let it sit out &amp;opened for 1-2 hours so that the smell would settled. BUT THESE BRUSHES ARE AMAZING ! For 17 bucks ? They are comprable to my Sephora brushes that i spend a fortune on ! The bristles &amp; hairs on the brushes are pretty soft definitely not rough . Im so excited to see how long they will last, so I will definitely update this review after 2 weeks , a month &amp; so fourth. Oh &amp; the shipping was great, received my product the day of order thnx to andres, an amazon customer service representor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s been about 6-7 months since Ive gotten these brushes ! They still work amazingly great! I&#x27;ve lost a few brushes but i definitely love these applicators. For the price yu definitely CANNOT beat it!</li>
    <li> These brushes are so soft. I often find myself reaching for them everyday. They are my go to brushes. I love them.</li>
    <li> These brushes are a great buy. As a makeup artist I have a great variety to choose from and the quality is great for price...way better quality than I was expecting. I purchased the pink vegan brush set by Shany as well. I will definitely not purchase another high-end overpriced set like in the past with these brushes available. Each set I purchased also came with a very nice brush case.</li>
    <li> when I received these brushes I expected them to be semi good since they were goat hair but no I really do not like them they don&#x27;t pick up color well and when they do, it just ends up going eveywhere but your eye, for a beginner in makeup they might be ok but definitely not professional use</li>
    <li> I have been flip-flopping on whether to buy this item or not and I decided just to try it. I&#x27;m glad I did to see the poor quality and that will keep me from buying from them in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) The case is vinyl but its not poor quality. I actually liked it and the smell wore off over night. It was soft and pliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) The brushes are pretty bad, though. I followed one reviewer&#x27;s advice and washed them before use. I cannot attest if this made them work better but they didn&#x27;t work very well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) The brushes didn&#x27;t pick up the powders. I wasn&#x27;t interested in the face brushes as much as the eyes and lip. I tried the brushed on a couple different brands of shadows (Urban Decay, Stilla, Sephora) and the brushes scraped the powder off the compacts but didn&#x27;t pick it up. I ended up with lint-like balls of powder. It was hard to get any coverage and a lot of the shadow ended up on my face/under eyes and not where it was supposed to be, even with primer. The liquid eyeliner brush was particularly horrible. It wasn&#x27;t stiff enough to do any good and even when loaded down with liner, bristles stuck out every which direction and I couldn&#x27;t get a smooth line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.) The bristles fell out a lot on the face brushes. When I washed them, I got a lot of dye out too. Which is fine, I didn&#x27;t mind that, but the bristles made a small pile in the bottom of my sink, like I had rinsed off my dog&#x27;s brush. I also noticed on the eye brushes that a lot of the bristles were uneven/not in tight formation. This means they wont pick up the power very well and they certainly had trouble with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Don&#x27;t waste your money. I might consider this set for a 13yr old girl who has a lot to learn but probably not. You&#x27;d be better off buying a small kit from Target for $30. I&#x27;m 27 and am just starting to get into makeup and I&#x27;m returning these. They make application difficult and will waste my expensive products.</li>
    <li> All I can say is Amazing! I couldn&#x27;t wait to use my brushes.. thanks the only Con that I have is that when I received the package I had to pay  the postmaster the remaining of the postage.  buts that&#x27;s OK its worth it...</li>
    <li> very soft very amazing and the leather pouch smells good. its very authentic and the brushes look amazing. i would reccommend for any starters</li>
    <li> Are these Mac brushes? No. But for the deal I got these are good enough. Can you tell what brush is what? Not without feeling them. It would be nice if they were numbered or named. Also they shed like crazy</li>
    <li> I bought these because of the excellent price point. But when I got the brushes I noticed that the eye brushes are all flat. I thought there would be some roundness to the brushed for blending and smudging purposes. Other than that they came nicely package, a little smell but it didn&#x27;t really bother me. My brushes did shed a little when I washed them but not much. If you don&#x27;t mind not having &amp;#34;round&amp;#34; eye brushes I recommend these. If you do want round brushes I suggest you get the Coastal Scents 22 brush set. It&#x27;s on sale now for $22 for their 12/12/12 sale.</li>
    <li> I only wish the brushes were labeled.Otherwise, the brushes are perfect and great quality. I was pleasantly surprised with the product.</li>
    <li> all the reviews were great so i got on for me and another for my sister as a gift and these are HORRIBLE! The eyeliner brushes are fine but that&#x27;s it the eye shadow brushes don&#x27;t even resemble eye shadow brushes they&#x27;re very flat and looks like concealer brushes! Maybe I got a dud? But all these brushes are very flat and they smell horrid! I&#x27;m starting to think that they mixed up the brushes and put more concealer brushes in instead of eye shadow brushes.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. some shed at first use, but now they don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Everything was as expected, and it was a gift so she loved it very much. Good product, I&#x27;d recommend it</li>
    <li> Brushes shed&lt;br /&gt;all brushes very similar to each other&lt;br /&gt;not much variety&lt;br /&gt;soft&lt;br /&gt;not very good for face makeup&lt;br /&gt;primarily eye brushes&lt;br /&gt;good for the money&lt;br /&gt;good for eye shadow</li>
    <li> Good price, but the brushes are cheap quality. They bristles fall out every time I use them. I won&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and as far as I know she&#x27;s loves these brushes. No need to buy another brush.</li>
    <li> These brushes worked really well, they are very high quality and didn&#x27;t lose hairs. It came with a booklet that told you what each brush was for. I am highly impressed. I felt like a teenager wanting to play with my makeup!</li>
    <li> This set of brushes are great to have in your makeup arsenal.  They are of nice quality and well shaped.  Makes applying your makeup easy and convenient.  The only issue I have is that I would have liked to have a pencil and smudge brush in this set.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much I have received it today intact and packed nicely and exactly what I wanted eventhough it looks in the picture small and it came larger than i have expected but I guess it is so nice for someone whon needs lots of brushes and professional ,,, once again thank you so much looking forward to share business with you once more</li>
    <li> Bought this because I had previously purchased the shany makeup apron thinking it came with brushes but because I didn&#x27;t read the description, I bought this to put in the apron. I was very impressed. The brushes are clean, soft, and nicely attached so they don&#x27;t fall apart. Even with the cheap price tag, you&#x27;re not getting a cheaply made item. I kept the roll up pouch just in case but I don&#x27;t see myself using that since I have the apron to use for the brush holders now. I would recommend this to anyone looking for good brushes but don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money. That&#x27;s why I bought it. Tired of spending money on sephora brand brushes and Chanel. For what it&#x27;s worth, these do the same thing at half the cost,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-jill</li>
    <li> This company is amazing in everything it makes best brush set I have ever owned Shany has beautiful make up along with great tools to apply it with.</li>
    <li> I suggest buying human brushes instead but if you are looking for cheap I guess this is okay but it does shed a little. Pretty annoying taking the hairs from the brush off my face when doing my foundation ...  So I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend because of that</li>
    <li> bought this for our daughter for christmas.  she loves to do makeup.  she loved this.  it has every brush imaginable.  the brushes are soft and the hair doesn&#x27;t fall out of them.  they come in a very nice case as well</li>
    <li> Barely got them today ! they look really nice and in great condition. :) i&#x27;ll shall try them soon</li>
    <li> When these brushes arrived they were nicely packaged and in great condition.  The brushes are a nice quality and the role case is very nice to keep them in.  The bristles are nice and the handles feel good to hold.  Shany is good quality for less money.</li>
    <li> A great set. But there is not many small brushes and pointy ones. So for fine details, you need to buy some small pencils too. Soft and nice feeling on the skin, nice handles. Feels great to work with. Easy to clean too.</li>
    <li> Great value and range. A great buy for make-up enthusiasts who want to take that next step from a basic brush set and sponges.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. It&#x27;s a cheap brush set, made out of cheap hair. It sheds quite a lot and the pouch smell IS extremely strong. I ended up throwing the pouch out.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an okay set if you&#x27;re not crazy about makeup and do it only once in a while. I prefer the Coastal Scents brush set as a beginner set. It&#x27;s a little more pricey but the quality is much better.</li>
    <li> So many brushes that I can&#x27;t use them all!  I chose Shany because they&#x27;re a member of PETA.  Great brushes.  Zero complaints.</li>
    <li> Get what you pay for....&lt;br /&gt;I was only looking for some extra eye brushes &amp;#34;blending, shading&amp;#34;  the softness of all these brushes are amazing but that is about it,  mine had paint chips on the handles on a couple,  the hairs shed like crazy, though after washing several times as gotten better but still shed,  the hair it&#x27;s self where cut uneven on a few of my brushes. The size of some of the eye brushes are great for me along with some bigger ones I have smaller eyes and the small ones are great for more detail.  Overall ok brush set.</li>
    <li> The brushes are so-so; you pay for what you get. For around $1 per brush, it&#x27;s great for beginners to makeup. The big fluffy brushes I&#x27;d say are the best out of the group and hold the most value. The rest of the brushes (75% of them) could act as mini concealer brushes because they&#x27;re so stiff. None of them could act as an eye shadow brush.</li>
    <li> Nice brush set, lots of duplicates though.</li>
    <li> The brushes do not look like the ones in the picture and the fan brush is too thick, it does have a smell , but after washing your brushes will not stink anymore. The Leather pouch smells. It does have some good brushes though and for the price I guess its ok.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this product.  I have been searching for a good set for quite some time.  As such, I did a lot of research read through numerous reviews before making my choice.  The feel of it in my hand is very comfortable and the brushes are quite soft to the face.  This is yet another Shany product that I will highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I of course have my few favorite brushes but every brush is quality crafted. No splintering or shedding and the case is WONDERFUL. Very satisfied and will look to purchase with this brand again.</li>
    <li> This literally has every brush for such a great price.  I do wish it had a brush by brush description though, for us non professionals.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great!  I got them earlier than expected, and they seem to be great quality. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> After reading some of the reviews I was worried I wasted my money. But the brushes I got have nearly none of the issues people are complaining about. They are very soft and pick up product perfectly. They do not appear to be cheap brushes at all! They do have a slight odor but no more than other professional brushes I have had previously. When it comes to shedding, only my fan brush lost a few hairs in washing and none while in use. In comparison, the Estee Lauder brushes I have shed so much I really have no use for them now this new set came in. The only down side is that the case is cheap. But when else do you want for under $20! Where they skimped on the case is definitely made up in the quality of the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
