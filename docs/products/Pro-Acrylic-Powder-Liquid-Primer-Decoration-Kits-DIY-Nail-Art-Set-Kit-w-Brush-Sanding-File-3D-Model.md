      <li>, everything&#x27;s there, seems like decent quality, and the price was great!</li>
      <li>pretty good, did a good job on my nails</li>
      <li>I did pretty good on the 3 sets that I did on my own hands.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to get more of this sets.</li>
      <li>The powders are made too look like they contain more than they do.</li>
      <li>I love the size of the brush; I ordered this kit to do designs, not my actual nail, so the smallish size of brush is perfect!</li>
      <li>i will practice more once i have the time.  </li>
      <li>it was okay .</li>
      <li>Love the O.P.I. cuticle oil too.</li>
      <li>When I opened this product, everything seemed like it would be easy.</li>
      <li>i really wouldnt reccemend it to any one, they screwed up my order the first time but were very nice about sending me what they had not sent me, but still didnt get everything i should have gotten</li>
      <li>YOU GET YOUR MONEYS WORTH IN TERMS OF AMOUNT OF PRODUCTS!</li>
      <li>I was excited about it.</li>
      <li>and so far i love it !</li>
      <li>So when I received this it was just as advertised which made me super excited to use it.</li>
      <li>got this a while back it works good.</li>
      <li>With each new set I got better and the product was just as described.</li>
      <li>BUT THE ACRYLIC POWDER DRYS TOO FAST!!</li>
      <li>You ask why am I just using this product, well you see, a friend bought me over $300.00 worth of difference products for my nails</li>
      <li>right price for what you pay</li>
      <li>Well the first nail didnt come out as I had plan</li>
      <li>When I first received is nail kit</li>
      <li>so I just chalked that up to my own doing but upon doing a few more nails I noticed that this product dries really, really fast and get so sticky that you can barely use it on your nails because it sticks to the brush.</li>
      <li>, this one is to small to work with, but other then awesome products, thumbs up.</li>
      <li>The acrylic hardens too fast to spread evenly.</li>
      <li>it drys fast and is really sticky.</li>
      <li>But I still had to go and buy the glue and buffer/file from the store before I could really do anything.</li>
      <li>I really liked the item but the only dislike is that the brush it came with could have been a little more bigger</li>
      <li>The only problem I have is that the acrylic dries too quickly before I can shape it on my finger, no matter how much liquid I have on the brush.</li>
      <li>But the primer does not really have to strong of a smell</li>
      <li>as far as the products they are just like the salon, just gotta know how to use them!</li>
      <li>Maybe I received old product or something</li>
      <li>I thought for the price it was a great deal but had I known it was of such poor quality and that I couldn&#x27;t have it the same day I would&#x27;ve spent the money at a beauty supply store.</li>
      <li>First when the package arrived it was a small cardboard box that was falling apart and completely covered with packing tape</li>

<li> First when the package arrived it was a small cardboard box that was falling apart and completely covered with packing tape</li>
<li> I decide I wanted to wear pink and white nails for church Sunday, but I had to use my regular white tip</li>
<li> Because the little plastic things that hold the powder are so cheaply made that I wasted half of it opening and closing it.</li>

<li> I spent $15.95 expecting to get everything that was listed instead</li>

<li> the only problem I have with it is that the glue was dried up</li>
<li> It arrive in a timely manner and it was carefully packed.</li>
<li> I received all of the pictured items (The files were different colors and the mold was a few hearts).</li>
<li> I bought this product back in November of last year, so I decide to use it today  for the very first time, and I was so disappointed</li>
<li> The powder was old or something just not satisfied at all waste of my money and there is no primer</li>
<li> I pray I don&#x27;t have any problems with my other products.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
<li> the nail file just falls apart as I tried to file my nails down or buff them.</li>
<li> they all fell down.  </li>
<li> /&gt;this mess beaded up like crumbs...</li>
<li> The items inside felt a little grimy, but the powder had not spilled...</li>
<li> but I was a little PO&#x27;d considering I could have had it by the time I got my kits</li>
<li> , I am missing these 4 items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I save so much money by doing my nails myself, so I don&#x27;t need bad PRODUCT.</li>
<li> I sent them a picture and they still won&#x27;t replace the missing parts!</li>
<li> the brush was too small and</li>
<li> it didn&#x27;t get hard at all .</li>
<li> not worth it!!!</li>
<li> The product sucks, don&#x27;t waist your money, the acrylic powder is garbage.  </li>
<li> THIS IS A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!!  </li>
<li> I have never had such a bad experience on amazon</li>
<li> The brush was bad and I exspected the nail art jewels to be bigger like in the picture .</li>
<li> the acrylic powder and liquid was too weak</li>
<li> The arylic was weak</li>
<li> The acrylic powder and liquid are way too weak.</li>
<li> the acrylic is weak</li>
<li> I emailed them again and they asked for a picture, which to me is poor customer service anyway..</li>
<li> I&#x27;m tired of talking through emails.</li>
<li> What I kept, came out to be expensive for what I paid.</li>
<li> Absolutely disgusting I&#x27;m very disappointed I wasted my money which was my Christmas present!</li>
<li> And if I could give them a zero than I would, because that is how bad this stuff is.  </li>
<li> It smelt so bad I could smell it through the box &amp;</li>
<li> the smell made me feel sick for like 2 hours.</li>
<li> I am so disappointed.</li>
<li> I regret buying this crap</li>
<li> I hated it</li>
<li> VERY UGLY.</li>
<li> The glue is horrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I chose this rating for several reasons.  First when the package arrived it was a small cardboard box that was falling apart and completely covered with packing tape so the package was destroyed in being opened.  Second, several items were missing from the order. There was no acrylic liquid, cuticle oil and upon further inspection there was no brush and that was done purposefully because a brush would have never fit in the box it was shipped in.  I contacted customer service and they were no help.  Do not buy from this customer they are out to rip you off.</li>
    <li> The powder was old or something just not satisfied at all waste of my money and there is no primer</li>
    <li> The brush was bad and I exspected the nail art jewels to be bigger like in the picture . it was okay .</li>
    <li> products works great if you know how to use it!  i brought the electric nail drill kit but i am having problems trying to get the nail salon look.  i will practice more once i have the time.  as far as the products they are just like the salon, just gotta know how to use them!</li>
    <li> pretty good, did a good job on my nails</li>
    <li> Everything in the package was as it is shown on the picture. It arrive in a timely manner and it was carefully packed. I can&#x27;t wait to get more of this sets. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I did pretty good on the 3 sets that I did on my own hands. With each new set I got better and the product was just as described. Love the O.P.I. cuticle oil too.</li>
    <li> I bought this product back in November of last year, so I decide to use it today  for the very first time, and I was so disappointed&lt;br /&gt;this mess beaded up like crumbs...so I dipped again in the  acrylic liquid to make should that I was not doing something wrong,&lt;br /&gt;but guest what, the same thing happen again, and it was like &#x60;rubber it didn&#x27;t get hard at all . THIS IS A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!!  good I had backup. And if I could give them a zero than I would, because that is how bad this stuff is.  You ask why am I just using this product, well you see, a friend bought me over $300.00 worth of difference products for my nails so that is why I am just getting to this one... I decide I wanted to wear pink and white nails for church Sunday, but I had to use my regular white tip and I put some blue gem stones on them they are beautiful. I wish I could add an attachment for you to see them. I save so much money by doing my nails myself, so I don&#x27;t need bad PRODUCT. Thank you. Hope this help you on buying this product. Oh yeah I forgot all the junk products have difference names on them I didn&#x27;t know that until today. I wish I could send this mess back.I pray I don&#x27;t have any problems with my other products.</li>
    <li> The product sucks, don&#x27;t waist your money, the acrylic powder is garbage.  I threw out the powders and liquid I only kept the rest which is not even all that. What I kept, came out to be expensive for what I paid.</li>
    <li> When I opened this product, everything seemed like it would be easy. Everything looked the same as in the picture. The only problem I have is that the acrylic dries too quickly before I can shape it on my finger, no matter how much liquid I have on the brush. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for that reason alone.</li>
    <li> right price for what you pay</li>
    <li> Came in good use for women pampering day</li>
    <li> I really liked the item but the only dislike is that the brush it came with could have been a little more bigger, this one is to small to work with, but other then awesome products, thumbs up.</li>
    <li> (Wife) I actually had no problem at all with my kit until I emailed the people asking if primer came with it! THey said it did, indeed yet it was not there when I received so I emailed them. They claimed it didn&#x27;t come with primer.. No biggie but I was a little PO&#x27;d considering I could have had it by the time I got my kits.. Then I realized I didn&#x27;t get the pump or brush holder.. I emailed them again and they asked for a picture, which to me is poor customer service anyway.. I sent them a picture and they still won&#x27;t replace the missing parts! I&#x27;m blown away.. I have never had such a bad experience on amazon and I will never hop with these people again! I&#x27;m tired of talking through emails. I just want my stuff taken care of!</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed. I spent $15.95 expecting to get everything that was listed instead, I am missing these 4 items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 x Dappen dish&lt;br /&gt;1 x Nail brush holder&lt;br /&gt;50pcs Nail Forms for Nail Tip Extension&lt;br /&gt;1 x Liquid pump dispenser</li>
    <li> When I received this package the liquid had leaked all over everything &amp; melted the powder container so I couldn&#x27;t even use it! It smelt so bad I could smell it through the box &amp; the smell made me feel sick for like 2 hours. Absolutely disgusting I&#x27;m very disappointed I wasted my money which was my Christmas present!</li>
    <li> This nail kit is good the only problem I have with it is that the glue was dried up and I could not use it and the nail file just falls apart as I tried to file my nails down or buff them. But the primer does not really have to strong of a smell so that is a plus. But I still had to go and buy the glue and buffer/file from the store before I could really do anything.</li>
    <li> i got this kit for my daughter starter kit and she loves it and every thing she needed was in this kit</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t not buy This its garbage!! This s*** didnt work. The arylic was weak i made my nails n they all fell down.  Dont spend your money on this S*** its not worth it!!! I regret buying this crap</li>
    <li> YOU GET YOUR MONEYS WORTH IN TERMS OF AMOUNT OF PRODUCTS! BUT THE ACRYLIC POWDER DRYS TOO FAST!! BTS JUST AN OK PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> The product came in on before time. It was what I was waiting for and it is a great price. Thank You! I will share my experience!!</li>
    <li> I received all of the pictured items (The files were different colors and the mold was a few hearts). There are a lot of rhinestones! The items inside felt a little grimy, but the powder had not spilled... I love the size of the brush; I ordered this kit to do designs, not my actual nail, so the smallish size of brush is perfect! Also, the brush came with a cap, which is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it yet... And since I haven&#x27;t used any before, I don&#x27;t know how to review the actual acrylic gel, but, everything&#x27;s there, seems like decent quality, and the price was great!</li>
    <li> Great bundle! Thank You!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, very good price, I love, is as I saw it on the internet. I arrive at his time, very good, I recommend the product. Excellent product, beautiful color, good material, it received in due time, very good price. I am delighted with my purchase</li>
    <li> got this a while back it works good. everything came in good packaging. i am just learning to do my nails it works for me.</li>
    <li> i bought this because it had everything i needed in one kit and it does works well would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> When I first received is nail kit I was excited about it. I prepared my nail then I put On the acrylic the brush was too small and the acrylic powder and liquid was too weak I hated it it drys fast and is really sticky. Don&#x27;t buy this its a waist of money.</li>
    <li> ya get what ya pay for with this item i really wouldnt reccemend it to any one, they screwed up my order the first time but were very nice about sending me what they had not sent me, but still didnt get everything i should have gotten the acrylic is weak does not hold up well either........</li>
    <li> finally got this item today my boyfriend got it for me and so far i love it ! idc about the brush size cause i got lots of them but if i was you i will get it cause it was a great deal :)</li>
    <li> The products work great if you know how too use them. I do think there were a few things missing from my kit though, Nothing to important.</li>
    <li> The acrylic powder and liquid are way too weak. The powders are made too look like they contain more than they do. The glue is horrible. It&#x27;s not worth it. Go to target, rite aid, or Walmart and get the Sally Hansen kit, it&#x27;s much better!</li>
    <li> So when I received this it was just as advertised which made me super excited to use it. Well the first nail didnt come out as I had plan so I just chalked that up to my own doing but upon doing a few more nails I noticed that this product dries really, really fast and get so sticky that you can barely use it on your nails because it sticks to the brush. Maybe I received old product or something but for now I will not be ordering this brand again.</li>
    <li> The package arrived sooner than it was supposed to. All items were in package.  The 3D mold as described in description is supposed to be a flower or butterfly. It is a mold of dog or a lion. VERY UGLY. The acrylic hardens too fast to spread evenly. Because the little plastic things that hold the powder are so cheaply made that I wasted half of it opening and closing it. I thought for the price it was a great deal but had I known it was of such poor quality and that I couldn&#x27;t have it the same day I would&#x27;ve spent the money at a beauty supply store.</li>
