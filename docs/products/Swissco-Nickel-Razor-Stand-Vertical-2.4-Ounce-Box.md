      <li>but it&#x27;s easy to remove your razor from and also to replace.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this stand for about a year, it still looks like new; definitely a good coating of Nickel on it.  </li>
      <li>This fit the bill.  </li>
      <li>I already had a nice stand for my brush but was looking for something reasonably priced that could store my Fusion Power razor.  </li>
      <li>is it&#x27;s rust free.</li>
      <li>Fit my merkur</li>
      <li>They both fit</li>
      <li>Worth the money!  </li>
      <li>Just be aware the picture on amazon&#x27;s site looks a lot more \\&quot;chrome\\&quot;</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s more sturdy than artsy, but I has a certain manliness to it.</li>
      <li>Finish looks good, seems solid..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s simple, good value.  </li>
      <li>nice and simple but cool locking just what I neededd</li>
      <li>Simple and effective.</li>
      <li>It is just tall enough to fit the razor, the &#x27;U&#x27; shaped cup at the top fits just beneath the head of the razor.  </li>
      <li>Simple design and looks nice on the counter.</li>
      <li>Holds the razor nicely and lets it dry quickly too</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s sleek look adds a certain character to my shaving arsenal!</li>
      <li>I looked a number of razor stands and this one had the features I was looking for at a very reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>He likes it very much.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t need to be polished, buffed, towel dried or stored in its own special box.</li>
      <li>Solid and handsome...</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t, and I&#x27;ve tried to tip it pretty forcefully.</li>
      <li>Simply put, I love the function of the stand.</li>
      <li>I like this stand better than those that simply offer a place to hang your razor.</li>
      <li>First does the design accomplish its functional goal?</li>
      <li>All in all, while it would be easy to buy a lesser stand at various price points, you could not buy a better stand at any price.</li>
      <li>For me, there are several universal standards of good design that apply to all products of this sort.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly this small lightweight stand accomplishes this job with flying colors.</li>
      <li>I guess it is good to have a small footprint on the counter.</li>
      <li>short, don&#x27;t waste $30, $40, or even $90 on a stand that probably wont be as nice as this one, just get this one and be glad you did.</li>
      <li>Also, having your razor \\&quot;stand up\\&quot; on the sink makes for more room for other stuff (which I won&#x27;t go into here ; ).</li>
      <li>One could reasonably ask, \\&quot;What makes a well designed razor stand?</li>
      <li>than the stand really is.</li>
      <li>More is less.</li>
      <li>It is strong enough to withstand potential mishaps and light enough to minimize damage to anything if it should be dropped.</li>
      <li>After receiving this there&#x27;s no way I could justify spending more on the more expensive stands I&#x27;ve seen here.</li>
      <li>the razor and blade and stand combo for some reason contribute to a much longer life on blades (purchased seperately so not a special special souped up one time blade)</li>
      <li>The whole thing was crooked.</li>
      <li>I originally worried that it would not be as stable enough, but the added mass of the metal loop and the cup for the razor stem combined with the well balanced cantilever design create a very stable low center of gravity.</li>
      <li>see no way the other, significantly more expensive, versions of this product could be any better.  </li>
      <li>That may be due to the fact that the Futur is a heavy razor, but as other reviewers have said, it is well engineered and has a perfect center of gravity.</li>
      <li>Just tall and wide enough to hold the razor and be stable, without being excessively large to take up too much counter</li>
      <li>It has not rusted and still looks like new after several months of use.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described and what I expected!</li>
      <li>So yea - you have to make sure the razor fits the stand, not the other way round.</li>
      <li>Also, the safety razor bottom wants to slide out, so I have to be careful when I prop it in there.</li>
      <li>I just bought a new Merkur DE HD long handle razor [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>The Futur is just long enough and a little bit extra wide at the top, but it fits.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ve still got to wipe down the razor&#x27;s blades with a few light strokes from a &amp;#34;retired&amp;#34;toothbrush....</li>
      <li>My razor sets into it without much fuss, fits well and it keeps the blade dry and sharp.</li>

    <li> Performs as expected.</li>
    <li> This fits either of my two razors perfectly.  Very nice finish to the metal, and no plastic parts.  Easy to keep clean and an attractive way to keep a razor handy on a bathroom vanity or table.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this stand.  It is well made, the finish is nice, and fits my Parker DE razor perfectly.  It is just tall enough to fit the razor, the &#x27;U&#x27; shaped cup at the top fits just beneath the head of the razor.  That combined with the base diameter and tilt back angle make for a sturdy stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems odd, but this little stand is well engineered.  Just tall and wide enough to hold the razor and be stable, without being excessively large to take up too much counter space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see no way the other, significantly more expensive, versions of this product could be any better.  In fact, looking at the designs of some other stands I&#x27;d suggest they may not be as sturdy as this one.  The others made of stamped metal also have flat shiny surfaces that would collect water spots and get ugly, this little guy just keeps looking nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, don&#x27;t waste $30, $40, or even $90 on a stand that probably wont be as nice as this one, just get this one and be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stand for about a year, it still looks like new; definitely a good coating of Nickel on it.  I have a nice Muhle razor handle and this is an appropriate stand for it.</li>
    <li> I just bought a new Merkur DE HD long handle razor [[ASIN:B001KS685W Merkur HD Long Handle Safety Razor with Blue Handle - #38B - Made in Germany]] and purchased this stand for it. The razor fits beautifully on it and the chrome finish of the stand is really quite attractive and provides a very nice display for the razor.</li>
    <li> It works well with my Muhle R89 and cannot imagine it not working for other razors.&lt;br /&gt;It is a simple prop for you razor.</li>
    <li> Good quality, but overpriced.</li>
    <li> Holds the razor nicely and lets it dry quickly too</li>
    <li> PROS: Nice chrome finish, looks attractive on vanity.&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Only one, you have to place the safety razor on it &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34;, in order to make it stay in place..</li>
    <li> I like this stand better than those that simply offer a place to hang your razor. It may not be as space efficient as a combo brush/razor stand but it&#x27;s easy to remove your razor from and also to replace. Best of all it makes a shiny DE Razor look poised and ready to go!</li>
    <li> This is frivolous kind of thing, but it makes me feel special every time I shave. it&#x27;s more sturdy than artsy, but I has a certain manliness to it. Very good quality. Simple and effective.</li>
    <li> Fit my merkur nice looks good it the countertop in the bathroom nice and simple but cool locking just what I neededd</li>
    <li> It is a great value and matches the feel of nickel stands costing 5 times as much.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money..it came soldered together in a tilted fashion. Afraid to bend it straight or it might break. The whole thing was crooked.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband who has been wanting one for some time.  It&#x27;s simple, good value.  He likes it very much.</li>
    <li> Worth the money!  Solid and handsome... also nice buying something that isn&#x27;t made in china (it&#x27;s Italian)</li>
    <li> Nice perfect for my razor</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe i paid $25 for this piece of junk</li>
    <li> My Merkur Futur fits on this stand. The Futur is just long enough and a little bit extra wide at the top, but it fits. I was worried that the razor and stand would tip over. They don&#x27;t, and I&#x27;ve tried to tip it pretty forcefully. That may be due to the fact that the Futur is a heavy razor, but as other reviewers have said, it is well engineered and has a perfect center of gravity. Also, having your razor \\&quot;stand up\\&quot; on the sink makes for more room for other stuff (which I won&#x27;t go into here ; ). So, I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is much smaller than I thought it would be, but it holds the razor perfectly. I guess it is good to have a small footprint on the counter. Just gave as a gift, so will update with durability as time marches on. Pleased with purchase and think nickel will be more durable than chrome which does eventually start to flake.</li>
    <li> Built well enough but my Merker razor slips out all the time. I just wish it had a little lip on the bottom to hold it there.</li>
    <li> My razor has a thick handle which causes it to occasionally slide out of the base.  With another razor, I&#x27;m sure it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
    <li> Practical way to store your razor and have it handy too.  Has small footprint so as not to take up a lot of space.</li>
    <li> Absolutely essential for keeping those 5-blade razor blade surfaces from accumulating unhealthy amounts of rust. You&#x27;ve still got to wipe down the razor&#x27;s blades with a few light strokes from a &amp;#34;retired&amp;#34;toothbrush....before shaking off the excess water....and finally sliding the razor onto this nifty stand.</li>
    <li> Simply put, I love the function of the stand. My razor sets into it without much fuss, fits well and it keeps the blade dry and sharp. Unfortunately my Merkur razor is chrome and it does not match the slightly yellowish nickel plating of the stand. Just be aware the picture on amazon&#x27;s site looks a lot more \\&quot;chrome\\&quot; than the stand really is. Should really be available in chrome as most high-end razors are.</li>
    <li> This is a very simple piece of metal, and over-priced for what it is. Also, the safety razor bottom wants to slide out, so I have to be careful when I prop it in there. But otherwise, it works and I&#x27;m going to keep using it.</li>
    <li> This is functional design simplicity.  Elegant and nothing to break.  It will last longer than I will.  It was money well spent.</li>
    <li> Fit my Merkur 39C Sledgehammer perfectly, made in Italy, not China.  Quality.</li>
    <li> the razor and blade and stand combo for some reason contribute to a much longer life on blades (purchased seperately so not a special special souped up one time blade)</li>
    <li> the only reason I didnt give this five stars is that it was expensive for what it was. Otherwise I am happy with it! If you want to keep your razor clean and neat in the shower, this is great.</li>
    <li> After receiving this there&#x27;s no way I could justify spending more on the more expensive stands I&#x27;ve seen here. Finish looks good, seems solid.. no complaints.</li>
    <li> I looked a number of razor stands and this one had the features I was looking for at a very reasonable price.  It has not rusted and still looks like new after several months of use.</li>
    <li> I have a Cadet TTO and a Parker 65R. They both fit wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;Stand is made well and looks nice. A must for the shave enthusiast&lt;br /&gt;looking for just a stand to hold a razor.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a basic stand. We&#x27;ve had it for 2 years now and the good thing I can say about it is it&#x27;s rust free. The only thing I dislike about it is the razor base holder isn&#x27;t proportional to the razor we have. The butt of the razor is a few millimeters wider than the holder so it sits on the stand precariously. So yea - you have to make sure the razor fits the stand, not the other way round. I think that&#x27;s unfortunate.</li>
    <li> One could reasonably ask, \\&quot;What makes a well designed razor stand? For me, there are several universal standards of good design that apply to all products of this sort. First does the design accomplish its functional goal? A razor stand should hold the razor in a stable position that protects both the razor and the user and accomplish this in an ergonomically efficient manor. Surprisingly this small lightweight stand accomplishes this job with flying colors. I originally worried that it would not be as stable enough, but the added mass of the metal loop and the cup for the razor stem combined with the well balanced cantilever design create a very stable low center of gravity. Without my glasses, I have worse than 20-400 vision, yet even without them and with wet hands, I have never once had trouble placing the razor securely in it&#x27;s stand.  Next the item must accomplish its functional goal with a minimum amount of material. More is less. This rule is exemplified in the minimalistic lines of the Swissco stand. There is nothing missing and nothing superfluous. It is strong enough to withstand potential mishaps and light enough to minimize damage to anything if it should be dropped. Next, there is nothing about the design that permits for arbitrary stratification by wealth. There is no optional gold finish or monograms. Finally, age should not add or detract from the value. The nickel finish will neither corrode nor develop a \\&quot;wonderful patina\\&quot;. I can expect my stand to be as attractive and functional 20 years from now as it is now. There is no bonus for having the latest and greatest improved model, and it doesn&#x27;t require any special care. It doesn&#x27;t need to be polished, buffed, towel dried or stored in its own special box. All in all, while it would be easy to buy a lesser stand at various price points, you could not buy a better stand at any price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good quality stand.</li>
    <li> Fits Merkur 38C well.  Well constructed and looks nice.</li>
    <li> Not a very good stand if you ask me! Go get the one that you can put your brush and razor on! This one falls over and the razor wont even stay in it! Poorly designed!</li>
    <li> I already had a nice stand for my brush but was looking for something reasonably priced that could store my Fusion Power razor.  This fit the bill.  The razor fits nicely and the item looks great.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Quality product.  Very pleased.  Arrived as promised.</li>
    <li> Simple design and looks nice on the counter. Hold&#x27;s my husband&#x27;s chrome-plated Harry&#x27;s razor perfectly. Exactly as described and what I expected!</li>
    <li> I love this razor stand!!! It&#x27;s the perfect size for my Merkur 180 and it&#x27;s sleek look adds a certain character to my shaving arsenal!</li>
    <li> This stand is perfect, it holds my Parker DE razor and my Parker mach 3 razor, so I will be ordering a second.</li>
