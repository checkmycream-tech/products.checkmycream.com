    <li> I have hair that is very dry, so my stylist recommended that I use this to put some moisture back in after showering.  I paid $18 for my first bottle at the salon and have never regretted it - it works wonders in my hair.  Now it&#x27;s not a miracle product...the dryest of my outer layers still feel more crunchy than lower layers that aren&#x27;t exposed to as much friction from towel drying, sleeping, hats, etc.  But I think it does the best job any leave-in conditioner could do.  I know that this product makes a difference because when I went to visit my parents for a weekend, I left it at home to lighten my luggage, thinking that I could just use whatever conditioner Mom has in the shower.  I definitely noticed a difference!  My hair was so dry that on the second day, I went to Walgreens to try and find a bottle of KMS MoistRepair, with no luck unfortunately.  I am super excited to see it on Amazon for such a good price.  I am now on my second bottle and have ordered one for Mom.  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I was most impressed with how the seller packaged this liquid hair product to prevent damage in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;Just after I received this product I ordered thru Amazon again and the seller was different-I purchased Aveda Shampoo thru Beautification and would never buy from them again.  The product was broken and leaking when it arrived and they expected that I would have saved the damaged bottle and taken a picture of it , in order for them to send me a different bottle.&lt;br /&gt;A very disappointed customer</li>
    <li> This is the BEST detangle spray you can buy! A lot cheaper here than at stores. I buy 3 at a time so I don&#x27;t run out. Can actually brush my thick, long curly hair with a comb when I use this!!</li>
    <li> This is great stuff for your hair ... moisturizes and de-tangles.  Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> If you have over processed hair, don&#x27;t buy this product. This made it feel even more damaged, if that is even possible for my hair in its current state. I wanted to try something new and have been using Aveeno Leave in Conditioner and it worked 10 times better than this! The only reason I bought this product is I wanted to try something new and I like other KMS products. Wont buy again, returning the product.</li>
    <li> I love KMS products and this works great for my hair.  I have fine hair and its highlighted and can dry sometimes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all types of conditioners and KMS California Moist Repair Leave-in Conditioner is the best thing ever. The product gives me soft, easily untangled hair, while not weighing it down. The cost is worth the end result.</li>
    <li> THAT is what this product is for...no more static fly away hair. Especially in the cold snowy weather in the Northeast right now.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> This product is very good at moisturizing your hair. I use it when the weather dries my hair and on my extensions so they don&#x27;t become damaged. My only critic is that this item does not last long. I use it every day and go through the bottle super fast. Otherwise, i love it.</li>
    <li> Great hair product. Makes my hair soft and tangle free. Not to heavy in the hair and does not leave a build up of residue.</li>
    <li> I love KMS products. While I don&#x27;t think this product drastically changed anything about my hair, it&#x27;s one of my favorite products that I&#x27;ve used this year. I might test out some other leave-in conditioners, but would probably buy this again.</li>

    <li> It worked beautifully</li>
    <li> Wish it came in a larger amount</li>
    <li> Use it on my hair before I blow dry it. My hair is a little dry from flat ironing it so I find that I may need something a little stronger.</li>
    <li> My stylist used this when she was styling my hair.  It smells good and works great.  My hair is soft, shiny, and manageable!</li>
    <li> I bought this product while traveling and just love it for tangled comb outs.  I couldn&#x27;t find the product locally but found on Amazon.  So happy to grab another bottle.

    <li> My hair dresser uses this product.&lt;br /&gt; it left my hair feeling soft and smelling good. I like this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best and I&#x27;ve tried many. I have long, straight hair that tangles easily. A few squirts of this makes my brush glide through my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling oily or greasy. I can barely tell it&#x27;s in. And it does the job beautifully!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Spray it in after your shower, or even on dry hair and you can notice the difference in how easy it is to brush and it keeps your hair soft and luscious.</li>
    <li> This stuff is just okay. I&#x27;m a huge fan of kms but I probably won&#x27;t but this again.</li>
    <li> This is best thing I&#x27;ve ever used in my hair. I use it everyday.  I would recommend it to anyone with thin hair puts moisture back into it</li>
    <li> The product works as well as cheaper leave in conditioner and you don&#x27;t get much at all for the price you pay for it!</li>
    <li> My local salon recommended this for my daughters super thick, long, wavy and snarly hair. It works really well and for half the price in here.</li>
    <li> Really works wounders. I use it each time after I shower and just right before I blow dry my hair. I comb it into my hair and not sticky what so ever. The real true test is the summer time when i&#x27;ve been in the pool all day and all the chlorine has stripped my hair. You can find it in a travel size if you happen to be spectacle.</li>
