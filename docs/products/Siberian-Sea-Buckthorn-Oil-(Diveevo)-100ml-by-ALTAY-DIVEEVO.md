      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>Research it yourself for all its uses, and make sure you refrigerate</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>Just one teaspoon takes pain immediately from stomach ulcers :)</li>
      <li>Better than anything pill pushers provide.</li>
      <li>Read more about these MIRACLE oil (in English)on siberiantigersnaturals (their oil  doesn&#x27;t include a carrier  oil as this one, therefore it costs more).&lt;br /&gt;Other things that one needs to know-where is it from, how berries are harvested and how oil is extracted.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>This is mostly vegetable oil.</li>
      <li>I love it, I love it.</li>
      <li>Product is more for cooking.  </li>
      <li>A lot better than the over the counter medications</li>
      <li>and it was used by the doctors over there to treat many kinds of ailgnments.</li>
      <li>but it IS better.</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
      <li>That said, it&#x27;s a good thing; I use this straight from the bottle as a moisturizer under my mineral foundation.  </li>
      <li>, so maybe I just need to give it more time to see the full effects.  </li>
      <li>Works great taken orally or applied externally.</li>
      <li>To my great surpise I found it again on Amazon last year sold by this shop.</li>
      <li>My daughter have tried everything available on the market to treat the acnes.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>and at night(the bottle is still 85%~ full)</li>
      <li>it really helps to treat many illnesses.</li>
      <li>can not tell you with absolute certainty that is has made my skin better, (yet)</li>
      <li>It kills it quickly.  </li>
      <li>I really love this oil and would recommend it to anyone who wants a healthy, soft, glowing skin on their face.</li>
      <li>, I pretty much had an environment that supported healthy skin.</li>
      <li>more even skin tone (I am african-american--fyi), adult acne is gone.</li>
      <li>(it would have been nice for them to have an insert in English).</li>
      <li>I did observe that they doubled the price since the demand went up and since it&#x27;s been \\&quot;advertised\\&quot; by Dr Oz, but even at this price it is still worth it to my opinion.</li>
      <li>:) But I can tell you that I have used many other things (organic and non-organic) that I spent a lot more money for that</li>
      <li>and I get consistent compliments on my healthy looking skin, including numerous dermatologist friends and my electrolysis practitioner who is also an aesthetician.</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t smell funny.</li>
      <li>Unless you know Russian (which I do not), you won&#x27;t be able to know what or how to use from the product itself.</li>
      <li>I even used it as a hot oil treatment on my hair/scalp (diluted again) and it feels and looks good/better.</li>
      <li>First.</li>
      <li>dewy conditions and lack of sun always was in my favor pretty much all of my life.</li>
      <li>Help skin repairs inside (like ulcer)  \ outside (like wound, or running nose irritation, etc), full of vitamins!</li>
      <li>Product is NOT 100% pure Sea Buckthorn Oil.</li>
      <li>100% PURE RUSSIA SIBERIAN SEA BUCKTHORN OIL.</li>
      <li>Just wanted to let people know not to use 100% pure Sea Buckthorn on a skin.</li>
      <li>To my opinion this is as close to being pure sea buckthorn oil as they come.</li>
      <li>people aren&#x27;t supposed to use pure sea buckthorn oil, but rather to use it diluted with a carrier oil.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very diluted so</li>
      <li>I keep it in a dropper bottle and put it straight onto my skin with my benzyl peroxide cream.</li>
      <li>I have been using one made by Altai Vitamins (got it from Moscow) and it really helped my skin (all cleared up and doesnt feel dry).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>In Soviet era it was only available to the privileged ones.</li>
      <li>Looks like they already diluted it for you and it is ready for skin application.</li>
      <li>Somewhat dissapointed, it feels very greasy on your face like putting vegetable oil on it.</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;ve not seen big difference, but I&#x27;m sure is gonna work</li>
      <li>The only \\&quot;side effect\\&quot; I&#x27;ve experienced, and this may just be my skin being ultra sensitive, is that it sometimes makes my skin slightly itchy for 5-10mins after application.  </li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t easily absorb into the skin (may just be me again), so be careful about contact with clothing/pillows/fabrics/etc.</li>
      <li>I see from a couple of comments that this particular brand (according to the comments)is not 100% Sea Buckthorn Oil.</li>
      <li>shipping was decent and the product is as discribed.</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin, or this particular brand, but I&#x27;m not getting these miraculous results a lot of people claim to be getting from using Sea Buckthorn oil.  </li>
      <li>The main reason I lower the rate of the product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very orange when you first put it on, but if you rub it in well, it doesn&#x27;t actually stain your skin.  </li>
      <li>There is nothing I know of, other than Manuka honey, is as good for severe open skin burns as this oil; skin erosion, including female reproductive system; it is miracle oil for all stomach problems, etc.</li>
      <li>I have only used it for a few days now, but I absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>The oil is fine but the only English words on the bottle or it&#x27;s container box is the name of the oil.</li>
      <li>I notice that the spots I have are healing well, and I&#x27;m not developing any new ones.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It + metrogel seem to have calmed down the outbreak and left my skin very smooth.</li>
      <li>sun bathing in our short summers, and occasional tanning sessions around special occasions</li>
      <li>But, I went online and did as much research as possible.  </li>
      <li>I still gave it a 4 because, although it doesn&#x27;t completely cure/</li>
      <li>I am please so far.</li>
      <li>He said it was a natural way to treat acne</li>
      <li>but so far I got all the shipments on time.</li>
      <li>The doctors did not say anything about using it as cosmetics,since society over there does not focus on cosmetics as much as the western society does.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin extremely soft and radiant.</li>
      <li>(not that it permanently stains, but just so you don&#x27;t unexpectedly get an orange mark on something).     </li>
      <li>I only wish the shipping wasn&#x27;t so high.</li>
      <li>I take it on empty stomach first thing in the morning.</li>
      <li>prevent my acne, it does seem to reduce it w/o any major side effects.  </li>
      <li>It has exactly the same packaging, same taste, same smell,same color as it was back in Sberia</li>
      <li>When I spent one summer in a small town in Russia where Oblepiha / Sea Buckthorn grows in abundance, locals were using it to treat most of their medical problems.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ordered this product and got it in a timely manner. I have only used it for a few days now, but I absolutely love it! My skin on my face feels soooooo good and looks healthier. I also have some age spots on my hands and some of the spots turned red and rough; I was told it was Pre-Cancerous... Anyway within just a few days, the rough and redness has improved dramatically!  I really love this oil and would recommend it to anyone who wants a healthy, soft, glowing skin on their face. I&#x27;m anxious to see how my hands turn out after a few weeks. I only wish the shipping wasn&#x27;t so high.</li>
    <li> Note that it&#x27;s not 100% Sea Buckthorn oil: it has some amount of vegetable oil in it. It tastes that way and the the box says so.</li>
    <li> I bought this after hearing about it on Dr. Oz. He said it was a natural way to treat acne and it didn&#x27;t smell funny. My skin has noticeably improved since I started using it every morning. I&#x27;ve had acne ever since I was a teenager (I&#x27;m 28 now) and this has worked better than expensive cleansers and creams and perscription stuff from my dermatologist. Awesome.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing.  Makes your skin look great and heals wounds quickly.  Even know someone who said it was the best medicine with they had a hemorrhoid.  Heals ulcers as well.  Research it yourself for all its uses, and make sure you refrigerate it once opened to maintain potency.</li>
    <li> This oil is very yellow and will stain your pillow case or clothing.  Otherwise, I am very pleased with the benefit I have received for my rosecea.  It + metrogel seem to have calmed down the outbreak and left my skin very smooth.</li>
    <li> Very good quality of the oil, my skin become much better a smother. I was amazed to found out that the same product at local Russian pharmacy cost for half of the price. The main reason I lower the rate of the product.</li>
    <li> This is a really good quality sea buckthorn oil. It didn&#x27;t help my rosacea at all. I use it around my eyes for wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Good price, shipped quickly and seems to work well[[ASIN:B003CBXRL8 100% PURE RUSSIA SIBERIAN SEA BUCKTHORN OIL. 100ml &#x3D; 3.53Oz]] for Sjogrens Syndrome</li>
    <li> This is the best product! My daughter have tried everything available on the market to treat the acnes. We were advised by the friend about this product and decided to try. The price was great and an info about this oil is great. So, we got it! OMG! This is miracle! You can&#x27;t imagine without trying. I&#x27;m awaiting for more of this oil for 2 of my cousins!</li>
    <li> shipping was decent and the product is as discribed. I bought it because they say it is good for healing skin, it may take some time but hopefully I will see results as the bottle becomes empty. There is a lot of oil to use so it may take time. I am please so far.</li>
    <li> Affordable and effective, can recommend to others.Some people may get allergy. Always try on small area of skin first, wait for reaction.</li>
    <li> Total misrepresentation.Product is NOT 100% pure Sea Buckthorn Oil. A typed insert in packing say&#x27;s \\&quot;Ingredients:Sea-buckthorn oil,vegetable oil\\&quot;...so is it 50/50 or 20/80% Who knows....everything on the bottle and box is in Russian. Even worse, standard shipping was $15.28 from New York to California.</li>
    <li> 12 years ago I went to Siberia on a medical mission trip. I was told about this oil by the doctors from there and I brought a few bottles with me to the US. Ever since then I have been trying to get this oil since it gave me excellent results. I had a friend ship me some bottles about 7 years ago and the FDA confiscated it stating it was medicine. To my great surpise I found it again on Amazon last year sold by this shop. It has exactly the same packaging, same taste, same smell,same color as it was back in Sberia and it was used by the doctors over there to treat many kinds of ailgnments. The doctors did not say anything about using it as cosmetics,since society over there does not focus on cosmetics as much as the western society does. They used it over there to take it internally to cure just about any illness.I have been using it again since I found it on Amazon to raise my good cholesterol level (it&#x27;s at 79), and as a side effect I also have beautiful skin that may or may not come from this oil but I suspect it helps. I have better,thicker hair since I use it again and I take some every time I have heartburn and it helps with that. It does not taste great but I can tolerate it. To my opinion this is as close to being pure sea buckthorn oil as they come. I do not know the store that distributes it but so far I got all the shipments on time. I did observe that they doubled the price since the demand went up and since it&#x27;s been \\&quot;advertised\\&quot; by Dr Oz, but even at this price it is still worth it to my opinion.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin, or this particular brand, but I&#x27;m not getting these miraculous results a lot of people claim to be getting from using Sea Buckthorn oil.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s working better than any other over the counter stuff I&#x27;ve used, but so far it has not been a complete cure to acne.  It&#x27;s gotten rid of all the small/mild acne I had, but 1 or 2 still creep up now and then.  I also still get moderate to severe acne, which was what I was hoping to get rid of and prevent.    I still gave it a 4 because, although it doesn&#x27;t completely cure/prevent my acne, it does seem to reduce it w/o any major side effects.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out or make my face oilier.  I also feel like it reduces the amount of moderate to severe acne I get, minimizes the size they grow to, and heals them quicker with less to no scarring/hyperpigmentation.  It also seems to be very SLOWLY healing the scars/pigmentation I&#x27;ve had for years.    The only \\&quot;side effect\\&quot; I&#x27;ve experienced, and this may just be my skin being ultra sensitive, is that it sometimes makes my skin slightly itchy for 5-10mins after application.  It also doesn&#x27;t easily absorb into the skin (may just be me again), so be careful about contact with clothing/pillows/fabrics/etc. (not that it permanently stains, but just so you don&#x27;t unexpectedly get an orange mark on something).     I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 weeks, in the morning and at night(the bottle is still 85%~ full), so maybe I just need to give it more time to see the full effects.  Overall, I&#x27;d recommended it.  A lot better than the over the counter medications (with all it&#x27;s harsh chemicals) that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> First. Unless you know Russian (which I do not), you won&#x27;t be able to know what or how to use from the product itself. (it would have been nice for them to have an insert in English). But, I went online and did as much research as possible.  I see from a couple of comments that this particular brand (according to the comments)is not 100% Sea Buckthorn Oil. That is disappointing to me. But be that as it may. I have used it for about 3 weeks now, every other day. I have very sensitive skin and I am careful about what I put on it. I dilute it (and I don&#x27;t use a lot) with almond or vitamin 5 oil. The Buckthorn has a strange albeit light smell, which reminds me of syrup of ipecac (sorry, I know, yack), but it is not a strong smell. And it does have a reddish/gold color, so be careful about staining your clothes, fabric, sink, even your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I can not tell you with absolute certainty that is has made my skin better, (yet) but it IS better. My skin is softer (well yes its oil), more even skin tone (I am african-american--fyi), adult acne is gone. I even used it as a hot oil treatment on my hair/scalp (diluted again) and it feels and looks good/better. Would these improvements have happened without the Sea Buckthorn? I don&#x27;t know. Is it a miracle? Probably not. :) But I can tell you that I have used many other things (organic and non-organic) that I spent a lot more money for that gave me no results. I am going to give it a while longer and see.</li>
    <li> It is not taste as a Buckthorn oil. In the oil added different kinds of oil . I was looking for a real(100%) Sea Buckthorn.</li>
    <li> Good supplement for stomach and colon as preventing care.</li>
    <li> I heard about Sea Buckthorn on the Dr. Oz show. I have been adding it to my cosmetics. It seems to penetrate the skin well. So far so good. I like it. No WOW factor but I think I&#x27;ll keep using it for 6 months or so before I rush to any judgement.</li>
    <li> Good quality medicine! Help skin repairs inside (like ulcer)  \ outside (like wound, or running nose irritation, etc), full of vitamins!</li>
    <li> Taking this product internally has helped my singing voice and fatigue in only a matter of days. Also it shrank my belly. I have reason to believe it did so by reducing the inflammation in my belly. I only used it for a short while on my face because I don&#x27;t like to put oil on my skin. I got my third order of this product yesterday (September 17, 2012) and the label in English says ingredients: sea-buckthorn oil, sunflower oil. I read elsewhere people aren&#x27;t supposed to use pure sea buckthorn oil, but rather to use it diluted with a carrier oil. So this product is already diluted for you.</li>
    <li> is recommended for all tooth pain.  It kills it quickly.  Great for those times you can&#x27;t get an immediate appointment.&lt;br /&gt;Besides, I like the Russian printing.</li>
    <li> the oil is legit but compared to other Russian brands it&#x27;s very diluted so when you apply it to the skin it almost doesnt have that orange color and it is much oilier compared to the good quality one which is usually bright orange and not as oily. I have been using one made by Altai Vitamins (got it from Moscow) and it really helped my skin (all cleared up and doesnt feel dry).&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this one a try though frankly as quite disappointed with the quality...</li>
    <li> This is a pharmaceutics grade oil that has been manufactured by a pharmaceutical company in Russia for ages. In Soviet era it was only available to the privileged ones. It is a medicine, but you can use it for a skin care if you wish. There is nothing I know of, other than Manuka honey, is as good for severe open skin burns as this oil; skin erosion, including female reproductive system; it is miracle oil for all stomach problems, etc. etc.  Read more about these MIRACLE oil (in English)on siberiantigersnaturals (their oil  doesn&#x27;t include a carrier  oil as this one, therefore it costs more).&lt;br /&gt;Other things that one needs to know-where is it from, how berries are harvested and how oil is extracted.&lt;br /&gt;This is what written in Russian on the bottle: store in a dark place at 0-25C temperature; shake before usage; seabuckthorn oil not less than 60%; sunflower-seed oil; recommended 2 tea spoons x 2 times a day with food (internally). I take it on empty stomach first thing in the morning. Like all oils it will start oxidizing the moment it  exposed to air. So keep a lid tightly closed.</li>
    <li> If you know russian, you could read the label on the bottle and it says that it contains other oils as well, therefore, this is NOT 100% Sea buckthorn oil. Somewhat dissapointed, it feels very greasy on your face like putting vegetable oil on it. Would not buy it again nor would recommend if you want 100% sea buckthorn oil, this one is not.</li>
    <li> The oil is fine but the only English words on the bottle or it&#x27;s container box is the name of the oil. Some English words about the dosage, or some instructions for use would be an improvement.</li>
    <li> Product is more for cooking.  Item as described.</li>
    <li> I used it for my sinuses and it helped me.</li>
    <li> My Husband was advised to use this on radiation burn,it was amazing,apparently it is used often in Russia India and China, it is not recognized by the  American medical....Read up on it as it has lots of healing potential .....</li>
    <li> it really helps to treat many illnesses. I love it, I love it. I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT.  love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d not buy it if I see ingredients in the product description. It is not just this one - Amazon is not very clear on how the product for personal use should be described.</li>
    <li> Just one teaspoon takes pain immediately from stomach ulcers :)</li>
    <li> I noticed that a lot of people are complaining that they are disappointed that the product is not 100% Sea Buckthorn, however my research on-line shows that 100% sea buckthorn is dangerous for skin and should be diluted with other oils. Looks like they already diluted it for you and it is ready for skin application. When I spent one summer in a small town in Russia where Oblepiha / Sea Buckthorn grows in abundance, locals were using it to treat most of their medical problems. It has great properties and is used as a remedy for just about everything. Just wanted to let people know not to use 100% pure Sea Buckthorn on a skin.</li>
    <li> This is mostly vegetable oil. Not pure, not even close. Had the box translated by one of my co workers. It&#x27;s junk.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve not seen big difference, but I&#x27;m sure is gonna work</li>
    <li> this product is good.if you have damaged skin(burning) it helps.I recommend siberian sea buckthorn oil but not mix of oil.</li>
    <li> Keep in mind this is in a sunflower oil carrier base.  That said, it&#x27;s a good thing; I use this straight from the bottle as a moisturizer under my mineral foundation.  It&#x27;s wonderful on my acne-prone skin!  I notice that the spots I have are healing well, and I&#x27;m not developing any new ones.  It&#x27;s very orange when you first put it on, but if you rub it in well, it doesn&#x27;t actually stain your skin.  I keep it in a dropper bottle and put it straight onto my skin with my benzyl peroxide cream.</li>
    <li> Works great taken orally or applied externally. Better than anything pill pushers provide. Heals open wounds literally while you watch.</li>
    <li> I swear by this product. I was born and raised in the Pacific Northwest, dewy conditions and lack of sun always was in my favor pretty much all of my life. With the exception of undisciplined (no sunscreen) sun bathing in our short summers, and occasional tanning sessions around special occasions, I pretty much had an environment that supported healthy skin. Then I moved to Southern California. Smog, constant sunshine, and lack of sunscreen (I hate using chemicals on my skin), I had a need to find a natural product that would meet my needs. After a lot of internet research I decided to give Seabuckthorn Oil a shot. I don&#x27;t wear makeup often and I get consistent compliments on my healthy looking skin, including numerous dermatologist friends and my electrolysis practitioner who is also an aesthetician. Although it is not 100% Seabuckthorn Oil, it has worked extremely well for me. It does give you a slight orange tint for about a half hour but fades. I have never had any breakouts because of this product. I will continue to use this as long as I can buy it. It leaves my skin extremely soft and radiant.</li>
    <li> Item didn&#x27;t seem to help my daughters skin at all.  The smell wasn&#x27;t too good either.  If it had helped her skin, we could have gotten over the smell, but it didn&#x27;t help her Atopic Dermatitis</li>
