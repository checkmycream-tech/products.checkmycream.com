<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> LOVE.  Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.  It&#x27;s a very small bottle too.</li>
    <li> This product is really nice. It does give a feeling of lighter, invigorated legs. I actually use it after an intense workout and it refreshes my legs. The smell is great!</li>
    <li> Oh my god it feels amazining after a long day standing at work or a zumba session this just revive my Legg I will def always use it :)</li>
    <li> First, I have to comment on the packaging. I opened the box, expecting my lotion to be wrapped in bubble wrap, but instead it looked like a present! I was surprised by the bright pink filler and I was tickled to find a A Lucky, a fabulous little gift that I wasn&#x27;t expecting and I cannot wait to try! I already got more than I expected, and in such pretty packaging!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto the review of the product. I used this the first day I got it after walking all day. My legs felt tired and &#x27;full&#x27; so I applied this lotion, and was blown away by the immediate relief. The smell is minty fabulous, and the texture of the lotion... wonderful. It absorbed quickly without feeling greasy. Best lotion I&#x27;ve used in a long time AND it relieved my tired legs almost instantly? I think I&#x27;m in heaven! I read all of the words on the box, on the bottle, and the information pamphlet inside the box, and I must say that I am impressed with this company and their product. I will definitely be checking out more of their products and highly, highly recommend Lucky Legs and Mama Mio. Fantastic!</li>
    <li> This stuff feels awesome on tired legs or any legs! it does have a little bit of sparkle to the lotion. I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I first heard of it on a recent episode of Keeping up with the Kardashian&#x27;s and I lived up to they hype from pregnant Kim!  Only downside is quantity received for the cost is off but I&#x27;ll probably buy again.</li>
    <li> I saw this product on the Kardashian realty show. I thought I would give it a try since in the afternoon I too get tired legs. The price was good so even if it didn&#x27;t work I wouldn&#x27;t be out a lot of money. Well I love it. I love the minty smell and my legs are so relaxed aft applying the lotion. I plan on ordering more!</li>
    <li> Found this product and felt so lucky!  I mean, who wouldn&#x27;t want rapid relief from heavy legs and feet?  I&#x27;m speaking for all of us out there who hear \\&quot;heavy legs and feet\\&quot; as a nice way of saying, \\&quot;fat.\\&quot;  So, of course, it was my lucky day to think this product would relieve me of that.  No such luck.</li>
    <li> MAMA MIO IS NOTORIOUS FOR USING INGREDIENTS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN PROVEN SAFE TO USE DURING PREGNANCY.  FOR EXAMPLE, CAREFUL INVESTIGATION OF THE INGREDIENTS SHOW THAT YARROW IS INCLUDED IN THIS PRODUCT.  ACCORDING TO DRUGS.COM AND THE FDA, YARROW IS UNSAFE TO USE DURING PREGNANCY DUE TO POSSIBLE STIMULATION OF MENSTRUATION AND POSSIBLE LOSS OF FETUS.  FAR FROM SAFE.  ASK YOUR PHYSICIAN BEFORE USING.</li>
    <li> So I bought this product for my girlfriend because she was getting swollen feet n legs, and I was looking for something to help her. It was alright, it felt like water with oil mixed. Doesn&#x27;t work together. however, it did have a nice smell and like cool sensation when the AC blew on her legs she said.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 49 and have aching upper legs (front, mostly) at night (like nerve pain), and my feet sometimes burn.  This helps but is not as cooling as I thought it would be.  Nonetheless, there isn&#x27;t anything else on the market that doesn&#x27;t smell mentholy (like Grandma), so I will continue to buy it.  HOWEVER, it seems very expensive for what it is and for how much is in the container!!  Should be at least 5 oz!</li>
    <li> This does not do anything but smell good.  I have used it just as directed and other then a strong minty smell which wakes you up it does nothing for your legs or feet.</li>
    <li> The tingle does not last long at all...only a few seconds. For the price I was expecting more.  I will not be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> Looooved this product! I&#x27;m on my feet the entire 12 hour shift and with this in my purse, I&#x27;m well taken cared of. Highly recommended to all nurses who works in the floor👍</li>
    <li> This is on my repeat buy list. Smell is light, immediately got rid of leg pain. Husband who lovingly applied said smelled nice, nice to have relief! Would strongly encourage for tired legs, restless legs or injury due to strained muscle...I&#x27;m girly so love the soft shimmer, though not that noticeable.</li>
    <li> Love this! Works really well. I wish the sparkles in it was a little less intense but overall I really like it.</li>
    <li> When I use this product my legs feel soooo much better! Really helps with RLS at night. Wish they would give you more for what you are paying for.  I have to apply it about 2-3 times a day but I live in the hot and humid South so I need a lot of cooling relief. This product was a life saver.</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome. It is very refreshing and gives a tingling feeling of relief. I am 34 weeks pregnant and it doesnt completely take away the restless leg feeling but it helps. I plan to use this for after workouts too. It also smells great and has a shimmer to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several types of leg gels, and this was really nice. Not too scented, effective with a small amount of product. Left a subtle sparkle on my legs that looked very nice for going out.</li>
    <li> I am 9 months pregnant, and I have had restless, itchy legs that have kept me from sleeping at night. Then I had a massage at the Ritz Carlton, and they used this product. It feels very tingly and minty. I&#x27;m not sure it make my legs feel lighter, but it cures my restless leg syndrome so that I can sleep. It doesn&#x27;t last very long if you use it nightly... I&#x27;m buying my second bottle in just a couple months, but it is worth it!</li>
    <li> Loved this!! I didn&#x27;t really need it till 7months pregnant, and then it was a godsend, I got a few more products from this company and all have been awesome!</li>
    <li> Really feels great when you first apply.  Wish it lasted all day!  Great stuff, and I will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> I like it.  Feels good. Makes my skin feel soft. I recommended it to anyone looking for some relief on their legs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several types of leg gels, and this was really nice. Not too scented, effective with a small amount of product. Left a subtle sparkle on my legs that looked very nice for going out.</li>
    <li> I have had stronger lotion for legs and feet so it is only an ok product for that.  However, this was amazing for sore breasts during pregnancy!</li>
    <li> This is nice and tingly as I had hoped and smells nice, but it leaves behind a shimmer, which I hate and wasn&#x27;t in the description.  But seller sent nice packaging and a free sample of body wash which was much appreciated.</li>
    <li> Definently helps when I get cramps in my legs. I Recommend giving this product  a try. Would definently buy again.</li>
    <li> I was actually surprised that this worked so well. The lotion is very light and absorbs quickly. I love the smell -- very clean and natural. The effect of feeling &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; on your feet lasts for a good while after applying the product.</li>
    <li> Im on my feet all day everyday and heavily pregnant, it done exactly what I wanted it to do. Looking forward to buying more :)</li>
    <li> I used Lucky Legs when I was pregnant and my feet started swelling.  Lucky Legs helped with the discomfort I felt.  I bought this item as a gift for my friend when she was pregnant.  It was a remedy I couldn&#x27;t keep to myself.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day and it is really nice. I like using it in the morning and I am pretty sure that it help going through the day. I am 5 months pregnant with twins and my legs are becoming heavy! I just wish it was cheaper.</li>
    <li> Love the peppermint smell</li>
    <li> Really works. makes legs feel better and a refreshing, energizing smell.  Has a little shimmer to it also. Great product.</li>
    <li> Woah. Actually works and feels great!! Relieves tired, sore, achey legs and feet.  Tingles and soothes.  Yay for this product!</li>
    <li> I love this item so much I will never use anything else besides this again... its comforting and tingles and makes my legs feel great!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it has little sparkles in it, but the coolness when you apply it only last a couple of seconds.</li>
    <li> I only bought this because I saw Kim Kardashian using it. I don&#x27;t think its anything special. I didn&#x27;t experience any rapid relief on my legs. I</li>
    <li> I gave this product one star because I honestly didn&#x27;t feel it do anything relieving to my legs. All it did was make me cold from the spearmint or mint in it. Also it dried really fast making it hard for my husband to rub it into my sore legs. I bought it because I started to get leg cramps at 5 months pregnant. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend spending money on this product for legs cramps during pregnancy- would recommend you to invest in a pregnancy pillow to help position your legs while you lay in bed and stretch often. Hope this is helpful!!</li>
    <li> Not pregnant and never been pregnant...but I love using this after hours of shopping, working out, or a long day on my feet. Totally soothes tired, swollen, feet and legs...and even leaves them feeling happy, relaxed and loving life. I especially love applying some before bed. I find it even helps bring relief to joint pain in my knees, ankles, and toes.</li>
