<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> combs not bad, but, too rigid</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought it for my daughter, she always have problems with her long hair. And all those problems are gone with the help of this brush!</li>
    <li> Very light weight material, it feels &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;, but the design is what you are paying for, and it is worth it!</li>
    <li> my hair is less tangled no breakage and let me tell you my hair sucks when it comes to tangles! but so far so good i like it alot!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my kiddo and she loves it. It doesn&#x27;t pull her hair so it is perfect, this also comes with some samples of macadamia oil, amazing.</li>
    <li> its amazing....i love it..</li>
    <li> I have long hair that is thin, fine and generally unruly. I love this brush. My hair feels much better and I notice much less of my hair in the bristles.</li>
    <li> It might be that I need one for thicker hair because this one doesn&#x27;t quite make it through. It doesn&#x27;t get caught though. It could also use a bigger handle.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 5 year old who complains when I brush her hair. She wants to brush it herself so I figured I&#x27;ll get her a nice &amp; gentle brush. This is perfect! She loves it!</li>
    <li> This works!  No more tangles!</li>
    <li> Works great with a little softer bristle than the Crave Naturals brush. Perfect for thin, fine hair!</li>
    <li> Great product. Works so good to get tangles out, shipped on time!</li>
    <li> I have to say it is very good i have curly hair very hard to brush but this thing make it easy</li>
    <li> I use this for my daughter&#x27;s long tresses.  It works for her and she prefers this than her skeleton comb.</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve seen a comb. My wife is very happy with her.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY brush that doesn&#x27;t RIP OUT my hair when its wet. Great for detangling and works great for sensitive scalps. Bristles are smooth and don&#x27;t scratch.</li>
    <li> daughter wanted and uses it everyday, thanks!</li>
    <li> This is BEST detangling brush I have ever used! I have a Denman which breaks off my hair, I have wide tooth combs that damage my hair and I have tried finger detangling with poor results. This brush was able to detangle my waist length, texlaxed hair with ease! Not to mention, it EASILY brushed through my 2+ months of new growth! This product worked so well I just bought one for my mom! I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Works wonders on my daughters tangled hair.  Very happy</li>
    <li> Great brush! I have long fine hair, and it works like magic. I had Tangle Teezer before, and I was skeptical about Macadamia brush, but I do like Macadamia more. It has a very comfy shape.</li>
    <li> When I first saw this brush I thought it looked a little flimsy.  But to my surprise the brush works great.  It pulls out tangles with no problem.  I have very long straight hair.  This brush would be perfect for young girls.  I have never used a brush before that pulled out tangles with absolutely no pain.</li>
    <li> with this brush and mixed chicks kids line.. NO MORE SCREAMING AND CRYING when i brush my daughters hair.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan of this brush. I think it&#x27;s good for those that have finer hair and childrens hair. The teeth bend too easily. It is good however for short hair and massaging the scalp so it would be a great brush for men with low cuts.</li>
    <li> Bought these for all my girls, love this brush! It massages your scalp while brushing your hair. Does not pull. Is great for long &amp; short hair. Easy to clean, light weight. I can brush my hair before bed (100 strokes) &amp; not have my scalp feel like it was abused, I could probably brush my longer without fear of damaging it.&lt;br /&gt;Tangles are a breeze to work out, and no pulling.</li>
    <li> This brush definitely does what it states, it DETANGLES! My son&#x27;s and I have Medium curly hair 3C-4B mixture and when using this brush the bristles do bend but they snap back into place. I would have given this product 5 stars but the material of the brush is pretty cheap, if you happen to be brushing hair and you have oil in it, it gets a little slippery and hard to grasp the brush.</li>
    <li> had short hair for ten years so now I really don&#x27;t know how to take care of my hair&lt;br /&gt;this brush is convenient and smaller than most brushes&lt;br /&gt;detangles and leaving my hair smooth a lot longer than normal brushes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great investment - looks brand new after more than a year&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON: could be hard to clean in the middle</li>
    <li> I am mixed with blk, white, asian and my hair is very curly - spiral curls.  I constantly have to wet and detangle my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This brush is oddly shaped which, on the one hand, I like, but on the other hand it&#x27;s difficult to maneuver if you have any leave in conditioner on your hand.  Also, my paddle brush does a bit of a heavier job on my tangles but I still choose this and try to go at it gently.  Then I run my paddle brush through my hair to work out any other kinks that were missed.  I love this brush for my daughters hair which is stick straight and gets tangled at night.  She hates it (she&#x27;s six) but it works well on her hair when dry.  I&#x27;d say that if you have the money, then buy it.  It&#x27;s not perfect but it&#x27;s not a waste either.</li>
    <li> Awesome hair brush, if you have any tangles, this is th brush to get.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  I use this on my dog!</li>
    <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t necessarily get rid of tangles when hair is dry, but it does get rid of tangles when it is wet. My hair is thick, and I can&#x27;t comb it with a comb when I get out of the shower. Thankfully, this brush is gentle enough that I feel comfortable using it on wet hair and harsh enough that it gets through my tangles.</li>
    <li> My daughters hair is very long and thick. She gets tangles on the under parts of her hair (where is hurts worse). I bought this and it does NOT work! The bristles were not strong enough and when it DID grab it still pulled and wasn&#x27;t easier than our other 5 brushes.. I would NOT recommend Macadamia Natural Oil No Tangle Brush. The oil smells GREAT. But OIL for your hair?? Even just a little would make her hair look &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;..</li>
    <li> It has some kind of magic..... I took as much time untaggling my daughter&#x27;s hair using this brush as I wud normally take to untangle a single hair strand!!!! I love it love it love itttt</li>
    <li> I recommend this to everyone. It&#x27;s not expensive and your hair will thank you. It also makes a great gift!</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this brush. I felt like I wasn&#x27;t even brushing it, just smoothing it? I could still tell that there were tangles and I didn&#x27;t really feel like it did anything at all. If I brushed good enough, I still got tangles.</li>
    <li> I absolutely ADORE &amp; LOVE this product!! To be honest, it looked rather pointless, but my friend Nicole Guerriero SWORE by it. She said it gets tangles out super easy, makes hair soft, too. She was absolutely right. The length of my hair is just below my shoulder, and longer than that once straightened. Every time I get out of the shower I always used to use a brush on my hair (extremely bad for your hair).. it would rip my hair out from knots and tangles. When I got this brush, after getting out from the shower I towel dried my hair and tried it. This rush is amazing. The bristles are differently sized so it doesn&#x27;t tangle your hair more. It gives you shine, I just love it. I actually use this as a full time hair brush. The only thing I didn&#x27;t/don&#x27;t like about this product is how long it took to get here. Everything else is most definitely 5*. I really recommend this!</li>
    <li> This brush work great on curly hair.  I will never go back to using any other brush.</li>
    <li> My daughter has a sensitive head and I was hoping this would solve our problems...............it didn&#x27;t but it does work better than a regular brush.</li>
    <li> This brush promised a lot, but delivered very little. I got sold on praise, but was very disappointed with the purchase. The brush didn&#x27;t detangled my daughter&#x27;s curly hair; it pulled it. It was like any other brush you can buy for 5 dollars. Doesn&#x27;t worth the money!!! The only brush I found to work on curly hair was the one that has both porcupine and nylon bristles. Something of this sort: vz[[ASIN:B000O05AB0 B000O05AB0]] (please note I don&#x27;t have the same brush and can&#x27;t guarantee the quality of this particular one. Just want to give an illustration of the type). Good luck!</li>
    <li> I have thick African american hair and this brush is a lil to flimsy for me. I mostly use it to distribute product.</li>
    <li> So far I have purchased three of these brushes and everyone who has used them loves them. Works great on wet hair, just glieddes through the snarls. Loved that it was a bit cheaper than the &amp;#34;Name Brand&amp;#34; no tangle brush and works just as well...</li>
    <li> We have all seen the commercials for the Knot Genie. So I tried the Goodie brand hair version which is of a brick type of shape. I liked it and it worked for a few months until the bristles started breaking off. I also had the problem of it dropping out of my hand when I was brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we were at the salon, I mentioned how this type of brush goes wonderfully through my daughters long, fine, wavy/curly hair. She said they got a sample brush through INDIE brand hair products. That one is shaped like this one. So, I went on a search. I wasn&#x27;t able to locate the INDIE on, but this seemed like a close match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I picked this up. This shape is A LOT easier to hold on to. I also think the bristles might hold up longer than the goodie brand one (although I do think they are a little thinner than the one my hair stylist had). While my daughter still occasionally complains it hurts (her hair, like mine tangles super easy...why mine is shorter), she likes it a lot better than the regular hair brush. I even occasionally borrow it to brush my hair quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this again. And HAVE recommended it to friends.</li>
    <li> I was about to buy over 100$ Mason Pearson hairbrush when my mother gave me this brush for birthday. She was short on funds but knew I wanted a good one.&lt;br /&gt;I have long and thick hair. My mother works at the kindergarden and there many kids use it - it&#x27;s great for children whos hair are always tangled and it works out the kinds with no pain.The person who sold it to her said that its the one she herself uses as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my dream of Mason Pearson hairbrush vs this 10 dollar one then... I didn&#x27;t expect much. But I was very positively surprised. It&#x27;s so weird - it doesn&#x27;t even seem to glide through the hair but it does. Its so effortless. There is no tugging involved. The shape is very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really a gem for that amount</li>
    <li> My girls have &amp;#34;horses&amp;#34; hair. Really thick hair! This works perfectly! Glides right through. I was surprised because you never know when you order something but I would definitely buy again</li>
    <li> This brush works very well on my daughter&#x27;s hair. How ever the brush feels worn out is 2 months! I will need to replace it soon. For such high price brush i hoped it to last at list a year.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these in separate orders.  The product itself has no problem but the items I received which came from 2 different sellers were significantly different.  The first one I received was sold by Zulera. The packaging was nice and it was bundled with 2 bottles of oil nicely packed together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second order was sold by America&#x27;s Beauty Supply, for the same price.  But this time, it was shipped without any proper package, just simply shrink wrapped and it doesn&#x27;t comes with the oil.  It looks like it was a returned item and has been used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product but just watch out who is the seller.</li>
    <li> This is a must in my house for my girls in the morning.  It is really surprising how the bristles really go through the hair.</li>
    <li> My 7 year-old daughter begged me to buy a similar product that she saw on a TV commercial. Her hair is fine and straight and always a tangled mess. After doing a product/price comparison and reading numerous product reviews, I chose this brush. It works wonderful; it glides through my daughter&#x27;s hair, wet or dry! She rarely complains about having her hair brushed now!</li>
    <li> this comb is really cool, zoo much better than those wide tooh combs. Easy to use and perfect for any hair type especially thin hair that&#x27;s easy to break. this is the only comb i use now &#x3D;] even comes with a decent sample of the healing oil treatment and deep conditioning hair mask. love it</li>
    <li> it works as it say but i feel like the brush is weak and somethings it doesn&#x27;t seem to brush right that i have to brush a lot more</li>
    <li> i wish i went with the more expensive and I am sure higher quality one.&lt;br /&gt;it does not slide through tangles like the product says it does.</li>
    <li> This is a very comfortable hair brush. Since I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair it has gotten drier and more prone to tangles and this brush makes it easy to brush my hair out without snags.  I like the fact that I can use this brush on both dry or wet hair.</li>
    <li> I have very long straight hair that is thick and gets knots underneath. This brush does what it says and helps to get tangles out, dry or wet. I use it before and after I get out of the shower. It&#x27;s also great to tease my hair when I want some volume.</li>
    <li> The reviews for this brush hyped it up, and I bought into &#x27;em. Unfortunately, the results don&#x27;t live up to its reputation. This brush only works through the top-most layer of hair, unless you press really hard, which then pulls the hair from the head and makes my daughter cry and defeats the purpose of having a brush designed to be pain-free. If used on very thin hair, this might work OK, but it&#x27;s definitely not useful for thick, long hair. It&#x27;s also uncomfortable to hold.</li>
    <li> As a makeup artist and certified product junkie I&#x27;m always trying out new stuff.  I had received the Agave hair line (full size shampoo, conditioner, and oil) and realized how amazing oil is for my naturally greasy fine and easily tangled hair that I used to have to wash every other day.  This got me looking into a new showerhead (I got the t3 one and I&#x27;m astounded) new pillowcases (I got 2 satin ones and I am in love) and finally I decided to look into a new hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell you how revolutionary this product is.  My hair is thicker, more volumized, way less greasy, weightless, shiny, smooth, and manageable after using this little miracle for about a month.  I&#x27;m able to brush through my wet hair after a shower and not worry about breakage--this brush prevents it!  I use the Agave oil after I wash my hair and the brush glides through like a dream.  My product is evenly distributed from roots to tips so I get the benefits all over.  The shape takes a little getting used to, but I don&#x27;t mind it now.  Since my hair stays nice for about 4-5 days now (amazing!) I do need to touch up my roots a bit with my Batiste dry shampoo.  I spritz that on all over and run this brush through my locks and I&#x27;m good to go!!  It makes my mornings easier because I just have to hop in the shower for about five minutes with a shower cap on and I don&#x27;t have to take an extra 30-45 minutes doing my hair from wet to styled.  I can&#x27;t believe I scoffed at something so simple as a hairbrush, but something so cheap will change your life!</li>
    <li> WARNING TO CURLY GIRLS :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick with finger detangling, I tried this brush out once and had so many missing hair. Sure this brush doesn&#x27;t cause &#x27;breakage&#x27;. Also, why even lie if it&#x27;s not curly curly girls? Boo!</li>
    <li> My daughter is 7 and she has long hair.  With all the other brushes we have tried, she had such anxiety about brushing out the tangles.  I happened upon this brush and thought it was fairly priced and worth a try; anything that would ease her hair brushing concerns would be worth a try.  So  I gave it a whirl and I have to honestly say this brush is a God send!! It works great.  I have brushed her hair with it with zero complaints and my daughter has brushed her own with no pain and a huge smile.  She is so happy about this brush and looks forward after her showers now to using it.  The size and design of the brush make it comfortable and easy use for both an adult&#x27;s hand as well as a child&#x27;s.  I highly recommend this brush and am so glad and thankful I decided to try it.</li>
    <li> Works great on my daughters extremely curly hair.  It has GREATLY reduced the amount of tangles &amp; that means less headaches, etc.</li>
    <li> It is a great brush as advertised. It is a wonderful and easy brush to untangle hair and works great for kids also. Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is very gentle on your hair. I&#x27;m African American with very kinky curly hair and this works great. I also like that you can take it apart and clean it.</li>
    <li> I should have bought something like this years ago, but it never came across a product like this. I have been losing a lot of hair detangling, this brush has been a miracle cure. I lose so much less hair. Even less that when finger detangling. I find the handle a bit awkward to hold and tend to lose my grip. This product could be improved with a rubber no-slip backing.</li>
    <li> I like the brush, it&#x27;s light and easy to handle,my hair is very long and it didn&#x27;t work well as well as described.</li>
    <li> Ok, if you do not have this brush, please do your hair a favor and get it. If you color treat your hair it is a must have. I&#x27;ll never use another brush. It detangles and makes my hair smooth down. I tend to have alot of static in my hair, so I just brush a few strokes throughout the day and bye-bye tweety bird hair. It can be used on wet or dry hair and it&#x27;s so lightweight and easy to use. I think I&#x27;ll buy a back up one to have on hand. I love this brush. Oh, and oddly enough, it makes for great backcombing!!</li>
    <li> My wife used it on our daughter&#x27;s hair and they love it,it took a lot less time and they both had compliments especially when used with the No Tangle Oil it was amazing to watch no complaining and less time consuming.Thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> My granddaughter has very long thick curly hair. When I opened the package my first thought was ok another useless product to add to the collection. That evening my little granddaughter and I began the nightmare of brushing her hair. What usually takes over an hour and half to two hours took less tha ten minutes. Where has this brush been all our lives?! I do plan on ordering a spare and trashing the brushes we have collected the past six years.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this hair brush.  It&#x27;s so comfortable to work with and so gentle on  your hair.  I would like to buy another one to have on hand.</li>
    <li> This is the only brush that has worked! We have spent hundreds of dollars on brushes to untangle my daughter&#x27;s long hair.  It may grow straight, but it tangles so very easily and is so difficult to untangle.  This brush works best!  I even bought Michael Mercier Brush for Thick hair and that does not work.  This is a miracle detangler!</li>
    <li> This brush is gentle on the scalp and hair. I use it on wet hair and has helped detangle my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this brush and for now I have 2 (for home and gym)...Before I had to come my wet, tangled hair slowly and it took foreveeer! Now its painful and easy and would definitely recommend this brush for kids with thin tangled hair</li>
    <li> This detangler does what it says it will do. I use it in the shower when I have conditioner in my hair. It moves smoothly through my hair and doesn&#x27;t rip out my curls. The only thing I don&#x27;t really care for is how easily the teeth get bent and stay bent so, be careful where you store it.</li>
    <li> Works great on my long, tangled hair.  Does exactly what I was expecting.  Pleased with this purchase.  Received promptly, as well.</li>
    <li> Best brush EVER!!!!! My first brush I bought it at an exclusive salon.  Love the brush so much that I had to buy some back up since my daughter keeps taking mine.</li>
    <li> When my husband told me he bought this item from Amazon, I told him that he had been &amp;#34;hoodooed&amp;#34;.  He said he had read the reviews and that I might be surprised.  Well...I was.  It really works well for my fine hair.  I recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Awesome for getting hair brushed out after a shower!  It isn&#x27;t nearly as harsh on my hair as a regular hairbrush or comb.  I use some detangler still, but it combs out much nicer with this brush.</li>
    <li> When I saw it the first time it looked like a toy for my kids...really, I thought it was a joke. Then I just gave it a try and surprisingly it worked!&lt;br /&gt;My 7 years old daughter&#x27;s hair is very long, thick and wavy, not only that it takes me hours to brush it, but she always ends up crying when I&#x27;m brushing her hair.&lt;br /&gt;When I tried this brush on her hair, it made a big difference, the whole process was faster, easier, no crying and the hair even looks shiny!&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the purchase. I will order another one to keep in my daughter&#x27;s room... BTW My daughter just read my comment and she said.. mom isn&#x27;t that brush good.. I love it too.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Will not go back to a normal brush.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush, much better than any others I got before.</li>
    <li> Really wonderful product! It helps distribute hair oils and Dry shampoo evenly while it feels soft on the scalp. I will get another :)</li>
    <li> My daughter HATES getting her hair brushed.  She apparently rubs her head into the pillow while she sleeps so she wakes up with a big ole rats nest.  I have heard great things about these brushes so I was eager to try it.  They do work quite well, slides through her hair with only a little bit of work when she gets a really bad mess of knots.  The only reason I docked a point, is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to keep it&#x27;s &#x27;stiffness&#x27; for long.  The bristles start to soften and it takes a little more elbow grease to push the brush through the knots.  Not a deal breaker, but just a little inconvience.  You also have to make sure you have your entire hand holding the largest portion of the brush, your palm should be over the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to warn you, that if you have cats, your cat may be attracted to the sound of this brush and come running and demanding to be brushed with it... every... single... time...  I guess I should buy a second one for my cat &#x3D;p</li>
    <li> This brush gets the job done without breakage or pain!</li>
    <li> The perfect brush for my straight hair after a shower. It works through all of the tangles without pulling or breakage. I needed something that wouldn&#x27;t damage my color treated damaged hair anymore and this was  absolutely perfect for that.</li>
    <li> This brush detangles my hair without pulling or breaking my hair.  It takes way less time than any other brush, pick or comb that I have used.  And you can use it if your hair is wet or dry.  I love it!</li>
    <li> loved this brush its slides smoothly on my hair it dosent pull so much like the other ones I defenetly have seen results less hair on the brush and I also don&#x27;t have to worry about the brush popping out of the plastic ... I would most defenetly repurchase</li>
    <li> I really like this brush. It&#x27;s the only brush I have ever used almost everyday. When I iron my hair out, which is often, it works perfectly. Not so good on my curls. I use a wide teeth comb to comb out my curls then use this brush. Try it.</li>
    <li> Bought for my four year old nice (and her mom).  They love it and my niece likes to have her back scratched and get head massaged with it!  I just ordered one for me and will order for additional big girl nieces.</li>
    <li> My 8 yr old daughter has very long - very thick - hair.  We&#x27;ve been looking for brushes that work for her hair for the past several years.  She loves this brush,  and doesn&#x27;t complain at all about brushing her hair with it.  I don&#x27;t like it for when I brush her hair,  but it works great for her.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have the worst time brushing out our hair because of tangles....I love this brush! Makes brushing your hair so much better. No more pulling your brains out!</li>
    <li> When first holding the brush it does fit awkward in my hand as other reviewers have stated.  With a little time you get use to it. I try to bush my hair often throughout the day with this brush because it feels good agains my scalp. I do notice less hair being left in the brissles than with my last brush. I am thinking of buying another one just to keep it at work.</li>
    <li> Comb hair I loved. Unlike Tangle Teezer this fits comfortably in your hand. Do not tear your hair and very gently massaging the scalp</li>
    <li> does what it&#x27;s supposed to and easy to clean!</li>
    <li> You can buy the same brush for $8 ---&amp;#62;http://www.amazon.com/Macadamia-Natural-Oil-Tangle-Brush/dp/B006ON74II/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_bt_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;0200WTHXDDCDFX3FZPQE</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, but it doesn&#x27;t get out the knots enough. It might be because I have such long hair. I still like it, though.</li>
    <li> My kids fought over the first one and I ordered another one.  It easily brushes hair and makes it look sleek.  The oil is great for frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful hair brush. After using others that scratched my scalp after loosing its little ends or others that broke my hair...This one is perfect. I love it, but more importantly my three year-old says that it doesn&#x27;t hurt her head at all! She will let me brush her hair with it, and she will brush her own hair. It is fantastic wet or dry!</li>
    <li> Works great even on children&#x27;s delicate tangly hair.</li>
    <li> I bought two different types of tangle brushes for my daughter with a very sensitive head. She has long fine hair (angel hair). If my mother didn&#x27;t also have a very sensitive scalp I know I would think my daughter was just being whiney. I love this brush for the way it feels in my hand when I use it, but I am not the reason we bought this brush. The bristles are nylon and thinner than a normal brush bristle (very bendy). My daughter prefers another brush called the wet brush and since it is cheaper it makes it a better deal. I will use this brush for myself.</li>
    <li> This brush seems to help some, but I almost wish the &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; on it were a bit longer, since they don&#x27;t seem to get deep enough, and slip out from knots and tangles before getting them out. Still even with that it&#x27;s a good brush, but after awhile the pieces start to bend and it is less effective, so it isn&#x27;t going to last all that long, not when used daily.</li>
    <li> I bought this to brush my daughter&#x27;s hair by a recommendation of a friend.  Being a guy...I have no clue how to brush hair. I have always used a comb, but it just knotted her hair and made her upset.  This brush works great.  Some of the strokes take an extra try, but she&#x27;s comfortable.  AND as a side note, worked well with my beard.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this a lot, great stuff for newborn and toddler.</li>
    <li> Anyone who&#x27;s ever dealt with tangly hair will be skeptical when hearing about these types of brushes. At first sight, it might seem like a well designed gimmick. That&#x27;s what I thought at first. But after seeing a couple of reviews of similar style brushes on Youtube I decided to give it a shot. My hair is naturally curly and very tangly hair. I&#x27;ve yet to try it on my natural texture as I just got it today and my hair is currently on it&#x27;s 3rd day after straightening it. I tried it on my tangled dry hair and was pleasantly suprised. My hair is also very long and in layers ( the longest layers going a little over mid-back) and it was really easy and quick to brush through using this, whereas before it takes a lot of brushing to get every single little tangle out. It&#x27;s hard to describe the bristles. They are bendy yet firm and felt really nice on my scalp. There was a tad bit of snagging, very little mind you, but I won&#x27;t lie and say there were none. However, that&#x27;s probably normal if your hair is very knotty to begin with. The shipping was a lot faster than I expected, however, the box wasn&#x27;t as properly sealed as I&#x27;d like it to be; I&#x27;d rather it be a tad more secure, but that could&#x27;ve been due to the shipment. This and the bit of snagging is why I took off one star. Other than that I really like this product. I prefer this design and how it looks over other brushes with similar claims and I love the color combination. I also really like the ergonomic shape, as it fits really comfortably in my hand. Some people might say the handle is a little short but that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s meant to be grasped by the handle. Once you see it first-hand you&#x27;ll automatically grab it in a certain way. I found the price to be very reasonable and after trying it I admit I&#x27;d have probably paid more for what it does if it came to that, so it&#x27;s a great deal actually. I&#x27;m sorry if this is a long review but I personally prefer detailed ones myself so I&#x27;ve tried to cover all aspects. I will update once I&#x27;ve tried it on my hair in it&#x27;s natural curly state, both wet and dry.I will update once I&#x27;ve tried it on my hair in it&#x27;s natural curly state, both wet and dry.</li>
    <li> If you have curly hair this might not be your new best friend. I have the kind of curls that need to be throughly brushed when wet. This brush does the trick but takes longer than usual because the teeth (for lack of a better word in my dictionary) are a shorter than a normal brush.. So if you have thick curly hair you will spend more time brushing (and portioning out your hair to brush it) than usual.</li>
    <li> Best detangler!  Took years to find one that finally worked better than a brush.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this brush it is the only brush i use . I used to have long hair and then I cut it short and it works great on both! It is a great brush. I would totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing, brushes through, no tangles - no hair loss. So glad I bought , notice a great improvement in my hair condition already.</li>
    <li> I like this brush, and I do notice that my hair is much softer after I&#x27;ve used it.  However, if my hair is the slightest bit wet, it won&#x27;t glide through my hair like my harder brush does.  Perhaps this brush will eventually break my habit of brushing too hard?  Who knows!</li>
    <li> Brush works great on dry or wet hair-- so anyone who says diffrent, there&#x27;s something wrong with your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am from Hispanic ethnicity and have curly hair; this brush glides right through without getting tangled even with the worst knots in my hair,the brushes works wonders!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wear extensions and the brush glides easily through my extensions without a problem!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why these weren&#x27;t invented when I was a girl.  My 12 year old with thick hair and tender scalp won&#x27;t brush her hair without this.</li>
    <li> My niece requested this for Christmas, and it looked interesting so I bought one for myself. My hair is down to my waist. Literally about three feet long. It tangles. This brush untangles it without pulling or hurting. And without a lot of effort. It just works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised when I got it that it&#x27;s simply plastic with &amp;#34;squishy&amp;#34; bristles. A lot softer than a typical brush. I was very skeptical. But now, I will never use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve discovered that this brush works best, for curly girls, when their hair is already wet.  It brushes through layers of curls other brushes cannot attempt, and pulls less (when going slow) than a wide tooth comb.  I&#x27;d recommend it</li>
    <li> she has wavy hair and very dense...it doesnt get stuck, or hurts her. Worth every penny, would buy another. Dont buy the one you see on TV the telemarketers wont stop calling you!!!</li>
    <li> It is a great brush, very attractive and ergonomic, massages your scalp, but gentle enough not to heart you. My girls were arguing who will have it, since I ordered only one to try first.</li>
    <li> Love this brush&#x27;s bendy bristles! Perfect for brushing out my wet hair. (African American, thick, relaxed hair) I experience less fall-out and tugging. Gentle!</li>
    <li> im not sure there is such a brush that will never tangle your hair. im just really loyal to this product line lol. i love them endlessly. its fun to use and ive heard its ideal for people trying to grow their hair out, which im doing....only time will tell on that one. it also holds nicely in the hand (right hand) and i like that this brush has a handle because other similarly marketed brushes do not. theyre like gripping a bar of soap. this one is not. have yet to use it on wet hair.</li>
    <li> Gets tangles out so easily without hurting.  I use this every time my hair gets tangled or after washing it.</li>
    <li> I love this brush i use this for my bottom hair is just glade no pain.i&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
    <li> This brush was just ok. Ok, no. It&#x27;s really kind of aggravating to be honest. My daughter grabs it for me to brush her hair but then she doesn&#x27;t want to stand there for the 15 minutes it takes to brush with this thing. Usually I feel like throwing it straight into the darn trash, stupid thing. It definitely isn&#x27;t worth the $10 or $12 I paid for it. I almost always end up tossing it on to the counter and grabbing my normal, common sense regular paddle brush. If you have plenty of time to sit there and play around with this thing then fine, but for me, with my daughters long hair....its annoying. That regular brush works better (imho).</li>
    <li> You would think I was killing my granddaughter, when I am combing her hair after her bath.  I told her I just bought a brush that might make it better.  It is such a good brush.  No more screaming !!!!!  We are through in just a few minutes !!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for this product !!!!  My 7 year old granddaughter thanks you too - lol</li>
    <li> I really enjoy brushing my hair now. I really have long tangly hair and every night i wake up with a lot of tangles. This has work very nice till now, lets see if it works to reduce the split ends.</li>
    <li> My daughter really prefers this brush to any other in the house. The only drawback: when my hands are the slightest bit slippery (from conditioner or other hair-stuff) I have a heck of a time keeping my grip on this brush.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I have ever bought. It really glides through your hair so easily. Amazing.</li>
    <li> A great scalp stimulating detangle brush. It is wonderful for my 5 yo granddaughter&#x27;s long hair. She now enjoys her hair care!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this brush! I ordered it because one of my kids in particular hates having their hair brushed. This brush really does detangle more gently, and my child is much more willing to have their hair brushed with it.</li>
    <li> My daughter is mixed and I use this brush to brush her knots out every morning. I give it three stars because it only works if her hair is dry. It doesn&#x27;t work on wet hair. But I like how it brushes her hair when dry so I don&#x27;t have to put product and make her hair wet.</li>
    <li> I think this is better than the the tangle teezer max but these designers really need to work on the handle. These handles slip too easily. That&#x27;s my only gripe but otherwise it&#x27;s a fab detangling brush.</li>
    <li> Could not be happier with the Macadamia Natural Oil No Tangle Styler Brush. I have very curly and uneasy hair and brushing it right after the shower was a nightmare. I no longer need to worry about it. The transaction went on smoothly as well. Great seller.</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome for children and adults alike.  It really does not pull on your hair at all. l use it in the shower and on dry hair. lt doesn&#x27;t pull at all! l probably will end up buying another.</li>
    <li> Great brush.  My oldest daughter has very curly hair and brushing it out was awful.  After looking around at a few options I tried this one.  We&#x27;ve used it for quite a while now and it has held up great and still gets the tangles out like day one.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This tangle free brush works wonders for long hair for little girls.  I have bought one for daughter and then her friends wanted one after sleeping over and using it.  it really works.  Especially for fine hair that tangles easily (which is most 6 year old girls).  Will probably end up buying more as the years go by and the new friends come over.  It&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> My 3yo daughter has wild natural curls, and this brush doesn&#x27;t hurt her! I use it to untangle the knots and when it is wet after a bath before putting hair product in. Best thing I bought for her! Only problem is it disappears as she wants to brush her hair all the time!</li>
    <li> This brush is not bad but I found it very difficult for hair as thick as mine.  I had to brush my hair in several layers and there was still some trouble getting out existing knots although new ones weren&#x27;t created.  I imagine it would be great for normal thickness hair, not for crazy hair like mine.</li>
    <li> So much more tolerable for my daughter than any other brushes we&#x27;ve tried. Highly recommend. She brushes her hair now with more ease.</li>
    <li> Best brush on the planet!! Especially  great on hair extensions. Hair lasts longer with this brush!!</li>
    <li> Love it!! Makes combing my 4 year olds hair easy!! Inexpensive too! I think everyone in my family owns one.</li>
    <li> Daughter would always argue about brushing her hair after a shower or other times during the day.  When I opened the package there is no way I thought it would work.  It is incredible.  It really takes hair that looks like it would be a mess to brush out and glides through it with no pull.  My daughter can&#x27;t believe how well it works.  Her sister doesn&#x27;t have nearly the problem she does with tangled hair, but she wants one of these brushes now.</li>
    <li> I have 3c/4a curly hair. It&#x27;s great for detangling in small sections only. I wouldn&#x27;t use it without water or a product in my hair. Good curl defining, but for finer textures it doesn&#x27;t detangle every stand just clumps them nicely.. It&#x27;s soft plastic, bristles may be too soft for some, I&#x27;ve already bent a few but i like it soft on my scalp, and angles of holding aren&#x27;t bad. It does get slippery with product on my hands, and the logo rubbed off after 3 uses. All in all a good product for the price!</li>
    <li> Works so fast without pain</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Grand Daughter. &amp;#34;It dont hurt Grandma!&amp;#34; Enough said :)</li>
    <li> I would order again. this brush was for my 5 year old daughter. it is easy on the knots. and I love it too. we all use it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like a magic brush. I can brush my hair without worrying about tangling.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, and unruly hair that tangles for any little reason. Finding a brush that detangles my hair without the pain is incredibly difficult to do and I am so ecstatic to have found this brush! This brush is so gentle and it gets through my tangles with no problem. It goes through my hair smoothly and I think it actually makes my hair smoother as well as shinier. You do have to brush your hair in segments, but I already did that to begin with so it was easy enough for me to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very convenient tangle brush, lays nicely in a hand, works fine. Love the color, too. Now sure about Macadamia oil, it appears as regular plastic, nothing more. Well, it works, and I like it.</li>
    <li> Works well on our three year old&#x27;s fine long hair when wet not dry, though I actually got it for me. On my hair works well dry or wet. I have long straight thick hair. I don&#x27;t notice the macadamia infusion compared to a brush without it. Also one of the teeth is already bent from our daughter&#x27;s hair when dry.</li>
    <li> Great brush. I use it on both wet and dry hair. I have noticed significantly less hair loss since beginning to use this brush. Definitely would recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush after hearing really good things about it on YouTube.  I&#x27;m so glad I did!  It works wonders on gently getting tangles out of my wet hair.  It also works well on dry hair.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone with longer hair, or a daughter with tangles who doesn&#x27;t like getting her hair brushed!  It doesn&#x27;t pull, or hurt, or cause a bunch of breakage like other brushes can.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, and she&#x27;s been very  happy with it.  She also uses it to brush our granddaughter&#x27;s hair who wants her dad to get her one, too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after seeing a youtube review. I was immediately drawn to it do to the fact that i have unruly hair and frizzy hair! so I decided to give it a try. I received it very quickly like 2 days after i ordered it! I immediately brushed my hair and there were no pulls or pain it really doesn&#x27;t hurt my head/hair!!!! the best thing about this product is that you can use it on wet or dry hair!! it&#x27;s AMAAAAAAAAAZING!!!! I highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I have super thick hair and for years ive strugled with tangles. This brush helps sooo much! Glides right through! Wish it was a little less bulky but i love it! Also love the hair mask that came with it!</li>
    <li> This is the only brush I can use on my children&#x27;s curly hair without hurting them. It gets the tangles out so easily and without any tugging. I love this brush and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush due to the description stating that it minimizes breakage.  I have not found this to be true.  When I use it, it gets tangled in my hair and I have alot of breakage in the brush.  Also, as stated by other reviewers, the handle is really small and is hard to hold onto.</li>
    <li> Best brush ever...I am a swimmer and my hair gets pretty dry and super tangles this was amazing and no more painful brushing whether wet or dry hair.  Love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> This brush works really well on my long wet hair...was having a lot of trouble with tangles and this brush goes through easily without much breakage at all.</li>
    <li> excellent product it untangled my hair and easy to use and Reduced the loss of hair</li>
    <li> It works. i like it. Just the handle is a little hard to hold. Overall, meet I expectation. No more pain or very little pain while the long hair is combed.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVEEEEEEE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I have been eyeing this style of brush for awhile and when I saw that this one had macadamia oil infused in it I took the plunge. I&#x27;ll start off by saying it does what it says; detangles and infuses shine. However, I have very thick caucasian hair and the brush doesn&#x27;t fully brush my hair because of the short bristles. I have to brush my hair layer by layer, which is time consuming when I&#x27;m trying to be quick.</li>
    <li> I received this as a secret santa gift this year and i have done nothing but rave to all my friends how awesome this is! i have very long blonde hair that i recently last year took a oath to stop applying all heat too and since then my hair has been very knotty and this brush really helps me out a ton! i receiced it with the Macadamia Oil No tangle leave in styler as well.</li>
    <li> I can only say this brush is just ok.  It works, but isn&#x27;t as good as the Goody&#x27;s Brush we already had.</li>
    <li> It detangles the hell out of my super thick hair, but the only draw back is that the bristles are very bendy, so they don&#x27;t really get my hair good unless I section it.</li>
    <li> Excellent on tangled hair... my daughter has such difficulty with tangles and we don&#x27;t know why.  She has beautiful hair, but it got so bad she didn&#x27;t want to wash her hair anymore.  This brush was a lifesaver... she uses in on both wet and dry hair, but purchased it for combing through wet hair after showers.</li>
    <li> Helps get tangles out well</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift for my sister. She loves this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her husband just started growing his hair and he also loves it. He steals it every day and takes it to work with him.</li>
    <li> very good combing her hair. my daughter is very happy</li>
    <li> Bought this because I needed a good detangler and I am very satisfied with the results. I had to repurchase this because my mom liked it so much I gave it to her and got another one. Ouchless for me so I&#x27;m a happy camper &#x3D;)  This product came on time and was packaged nicely.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this brush at first, like most people.  It does work, but it&#x27;s not magical.  It combs through my tangles effortlessly and does not hurt because the bristles are extremely flexible.  I do notice that it does pull out a lot more hair than my regular brush when using it on wet hair.  Overall, a good brush.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughters thick and curly hair --unusually so for a two year old.  Her hair is smooth and even somewhat fine, but she has a lot of it, with a LOT of curl texture.  On top of that, she is very active and cannot sit still for very long at all.  This brush makes her daily brushing far more tolerable for both of us, and I am amazed at the degree of tangle through which it can pass with no resistance.  Now we can get through brushing and hair prep quickly so she can get back to being the wild little thing that she is.  It is exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> Works wonders on my little girl&#x27;s long wavy hair, wet and dry.  She loves that she can now comb her own hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s even personalized it with stickers.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend to anyone with kids that hate having their hair combed - wet or dry.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing. I was skeptical about the tangle teaser-esque brushes that were experiencing so much popularity, but my regular paddle brush just wasn&#x27;t cutting it - it tore out my hair and made brushing it a nightmare. I decided to order this and didn&#x27;t have high expectations, but it&#x27;s nothing short of a miracle. I have bleached blonde hair that is a couple inches past my waist. It&#x27;s fine, but I have a lot of it, and the bleach makes it tangle incredibly easily. To make matters worse I live in a windy area where winds normally reach sixty miles an hour. All this makes for hair that has to be brushed out frequently, and before this brush, I hated the chore. This brush made my life so much easier! It glides through tangles with ease. It doesn&#x27;t rip out your hair when you have larger knots and makes it easier to work through them without wanting to cry out in pain. It&#x27;s so great that I had to start hiding it from my sisters because they kept using it and misplacing it. After I did my sister asked where she could get one for herself - she has long hair as well. She ordered one and loves it as much as I do! I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Everyone keeps asking me where I got this brush. They love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 7 year old daughter.  She has wavy hair and I have no idea what she does while she is sleeping, but when she wakes up every morning, it looks like she has a bird&#x27;s nest on the back of her head.  I was using my regular brush with a lot of de-tangler (her hair was pretty wet) and it just was not smoothing out that nest without a lot of pain and yelling.  It was frustrating for both of us.  I read the reviews on this product and decided to try it out.  We have been using it for the past few months and it is wonderful.  We still use de-tangler, but there is no more yelling and the nest comes out in a fraction of the time.  Thank you No Tangle Brush!</li>
    <li> Works great on my kids hair</li>
    <li> The oil works great. The brush not so much</li>
    <li> This is a really nice brush, it truly untangles your hair without pulling or yanking. It also massages the scalp beautifully, and it just feels so good.</li>
    <li> Rips my hair not worth it</li>
    <li> I did not know what to expect from this brush. Looks odd and when it came in, I thought hmmm pretty cheesey looking. But WOW, this brush is great. My kid doesn&#x27;t scream getting tangles out of long curly hair. Gotta say I love it. Only complaint is the price. I bought it for $9.75, two weeks later I went to buy another and it was $11.50, two days later $13.23. I cant believe how the price has exploded. I did buy one more, instead of three like I had planned.</li>
    <li> great for my wavy hair. the back always got tangled and i would be ripping hair out trying to brush it. this helps a TON</li>
