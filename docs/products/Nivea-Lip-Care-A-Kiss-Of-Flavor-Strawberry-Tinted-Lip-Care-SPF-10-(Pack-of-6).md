<li> My lips are very soft and don&#x27;t peel like with other products.</li>
<li> but it is fruity shine strawberry that doesn&#x27;t really bother me though its almost the same except this one has a different scent compared to the other one this one smells like strawberries but also has an odd smell to it</li>
<li> Only problem is that the color doesn&#x27;t stay on a long time like a stain.</li>
<li> find those a bit dry and take too long to apply).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
<li> The formula stays the same for all the other flavors but the tint they give does differ.</li>
<li> Its the only shade i wear everyday religiously.  </li>
<li> Does not contain any harsh ingredients to dry out your lips.</li>
<li> All I can say is that is gave a slight touch of color to her lips</li>
<li> But this Strawberry one is just a little bit sparkly, but NOT TINTED.</li>
<li> It looks like any other ordinary lip balms.&lt;br /&gt;Do</li>
<li> The smell is strange and the tint is a weird red/pink tone that looks like you were eating a cherry popsicle.</li>
<li> Its strawberry with a subtle lip color thats packed with moisture.</li>
<li> These ones I ordered had no tint to them - and they tasted weird and dried out my lips.</li>
<li> This lip balm is so hard to find, I&#x27;m ecstatic that I found it on Amazon!</li>
<li> (Pack of 6)]]This is a must have secret weapon.</li>
<li> Not happy with this product.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m more disappointed when Amazon said it can&#x27;t b exchanged... :&#x27;( poor me..Help!</li>
<li> ,however I am disappointed yesterday when I got it,coz it&#x27;s expiring on Nov2012?</li>

    <li> My favorite Lip moisturizer! Does not contain any harsh ingredients to dry out your lips. Has just the right tint I desire. I reapply all day and love how it feels. Repeat customer for sure on this product!</li>
    <li> The best lip balm I&#x27;ve had. It moisturizes, it tastes good and it leaves a bright reddish gloss. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> This is not A Kiss of Flavor Strawberry, as the picture shows. This is Strawberry Fruity Lip Shine, which is a completely different formula.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend asked me to get this for her as she loves them. All I can say is that is gave a slight touch of color to her lips and I could taste a hint of strawberry when she kissed me. I like the stuff and I&#x27;m not even the only wearing it.</li>
    <li> I bought 6 lip care sticks for this is my all time favorite,however I am disappointed yesterday when I got it,coz it&#x27;s expiring on Nov2012? I&#x27;m the only 1 who&#x27;s using this,n hope I got the 2013 Atleast...I&#x27;m more disappointed when Amazon said it can&#x27;t b exchanged... :&#x27;( poor me..Help!</li>
    <li> Finally! I can finally purchase Nivea&#x27;s Kiss of Flavor in Strawberry without having to deal with the fuss of driving to every Rite Aid to be told that this flavor is not in stock.  My boyfriend adores the smell and how it makes my lips a natural reddish/pink.  The color really brightens my face and keeps my lips moisturized with the right amount of shine.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this item because I had used Nivea Cherry Tinted and I loved it. But this Strawberry one is just a little bit sparkly, but NOT TINTED. It looks like any other ordinary lip balms.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this if you want a tinted lip balm.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0044CTT8E Nivea Lip Care A Kiss Of Flavor Strawberry Tinted Lip Care SPF 4 (Pack of 6)]]This is a must have secret weapon. It has SPF the best moisturizer out for lips Q10 and the perfect hint of red I have seen in a lip balm. I use this as my daily lip color and sometime over my lip stick. My lips are very soft and don&#x27;t peel like with other products.</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  Been wearing it for years.  Plys got a thousand compliments.  The color is perfect with my tan skin.  Just perfect.  Its the only shade i wear everyday religiously.  Ladies, u will be happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> Love it because it not only keeps our lips moist it has some color which makes our lips look shiny and beautiful.</li>
    <li> This is not A Kiss of Strawberry. It is Stawberry Fruity Shine. They are not the same product.&lt;br /&gt;I explained this difference to the seller and was told I would get a refund.</li>
    <li> I love this nivea lip care. Its strawberry with a subtle lip color thats packed with moisture. Its amazing! One of the best lip moisurizures ive used ever.</li>
    <li> Not happy with this product. The smell is strange and the tint is a weird red/pink tone that looks like you were eating a cherry popsicle. I am sticking with regular Nivea Lip Care balms in the future.</li>
    <li> Very light and hint of color. Doesn&#x27;t melt in hot car. Has a slight sweet taste. Not heavy, greasy or waxy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. I thought I ordered the Labello Fruity Shine Strawberry Lip Balm not this. Now I have 6 of them. Guess I&#x27;ll have to give it out at work because there is just no comparison to the quality of Labello Fruity Shine Strawberry Lip Balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only great thing I observed was that the Shipping is very fast.</li>
    <li> These are GREAT, and they have such a natural color to the, just enough pink, especially if you are older and don&#x27;t want to look so &amp;#34;bright&amp;#34;. Only problem is that the color doesn&#x27;t stay on a long time like a stain. Very moisturizing though.</li>

    <li> This is a great deal, you get 6 of these awesome lip balms and it easily last me over a year. I started using these back in high-school, and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since. They have other great flavors/colors as well if you dont like the strong strawberry scent. The formula stays the same for all the other flavors but the tint they give does differ. This strawberry one gives a light reddish tint to the lip, and a shine like a lip gloss without the stickiness. It feels pretty moisturizing and smooth, I think these are better than the EOS balms to be honest(I find those a bit dry and take too long to apply).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros :&lt;br /&gt;- Moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;-Looks nice,shiny,glossy&lt;br /&gt;-Small packaging&lt;br /&gt;-Great scent&lt;br /&gt;-Healthy red tint&lt;br /&gt;-Cheap&lt;br /&gt;-SPF&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con :&lt;br /&gt;- I apply it all day, because it fades kind of fast.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is so hard to find, I&#x27;m ecstatic that I found it on Amazon! It gives you a lovely, natural red tint, and does not tend towards lip-dough. Love it.</li>
