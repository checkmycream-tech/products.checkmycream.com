<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the best trimmer i have ever owned. I bought one and immediately fell in love with it. I bought another and gave one to my son as a gift and he love it just the same. High quality and a nice close shave</li>
    <li> I purchased it just to trim my mustache, so far it does a wonderful job</li>
    <li> First impressions of this product were the great design and the weight. Although a noticeable increase in weight from my Andis Pivot Pro, the durability and closeness of the cut should greatly makeup for it. I recommend.</li>
    <li> Does not cut the hair at all very dull.</li>
    <li> I used the trimmers maybe twice a week for about a year, they crapped out. these are the trimmers that every barber&lt;br /&gt;and beauty shop has. I think Andis has lost a step or two. I have purchased a few of these and in the past they lasted longer.&lt;br /&gt; This latest version was noticeably lighter, but it lost some of it&#x27;s bite. Andis needs to go back to the T-outliner of the early 2000&#x27;s, That was a winner. I got the Wahl Professional trimmer and it is holding up for now. I probably wont be buying anymore T-Outliners until they get their ish together.</li>
    <li> 2nd Andis trimmer that I have purchased in 1 year - it quit on me after using only once.  The first one only lasted 6 months.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t post reviews about products, but I will about this one. I am actually pleased with the way the T-Outliner performs. It cuts close and does lines really well. However, this things gets super hot and then shuts off. Then I have to unplug it to allow for it to cool down before I can turn it back on. I thought it was just a defective trimmer, but I&#x27;m reading about others with similar experiences. I understand trimmers can get warm while using, but this thing gets scorching to the point where it&#x27;s hard to hold. Thinking I&#x27;ll be returning it and looking into other options. Shame because it does cut really well.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described!!!</li>
    <li> I recently bought this clippers and I it works amazingly. I recommend every dude to buy this clippers. I like it</li>
    <li> Good close cut for cleaning up neckline and ears. I am pleased with it so far.</li>
    <li> Donald Sterling can&#x27;t even stop these clippers. They are on point.</li>
    <li> I received the package &amp; it was broken. The blade was brken off from the shaver. I was so disappointed becase it was a gift for my bf. :(</li>
    <li> Everything that I expected,,,</li>
    <li> As an African-American male, I have very curly hair. Razors kept cutting too close to my skin and giving me razor burns/bumps, so I needed to make a change. Eventually, I realized that every time I got a haircut, my barber would use this trimmer on my facial hair and I rarely got razor bumps/burns afterward. Thus, I bought one for myself. It&#x27;s been great so far. I get a very close shave that leaves my skin feeling smooth. Also, I oil them about every other use (I use it 3 times a week). This trimmer is great for facial hair trimming as well as line ups/edge ups (I heard you can even use it for fades if you have the right guards). It doesn&#x27;t heat up that much either. Solid product 5/5.</li>
    <li> Make sure to always lube and clean after every use!!</li>
    <li> Highly recommended... Everything as described</li>
    <li> I bought this because I needed a new one to give my son a line-up and Sally&#x27;s Beauty store was way too much money for the same exact trimmer and they do the exact same thing.</li>
    <li> On time.  As expected.  Would recommend.  Would order again.</li>
    <li> I use it solely for facial hair and I absolutely love it. Chews through everything with ease, compared to those ones specifically designed for facial hair, you have to hit areas over and over to get a clean and even shave. Not with this thing, just rotate it around your face and 5 minutes later you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> Best shape up machine, every barber should have one or its great for personal use, this machine will definitely last 10 years plus so its worth it, dont buy those $20 trimmers that dont last</li>
    <li> I would recommend this clipper.  I use it weekly.</li>
    <li> Andis one of the best clippers out there. I saw my bouddy using it at the barber shop was cutting like a blade nice and clean, but ths one I bought T-outliner not what I was expecting at all cuts good not great. Good luck</li>
    <li> Had this for 3 years and it worked fine on hair but worked the best at cutting my beard. But really, it isn&#x27;t worth the price. It gets extremely hot and starts shutting off after ten minutes of use. It has done this since it was 1 month old. Also, sometimes it sounds like its on but it&#x27;s not cutting. This especially seems to happen if you hold it upside down. I&#x27;m buying a $20 set since it won&#x27;t even turn on at all now.</li>
    <li> amazing!! totally worth the price</li>
    <li> I hated this andis machine this is the worst machine i have ever bought ,it seems like its a fake machine dont buy this.the biggest problem i had was the vibration n the cutting,  the machine is not vibrating so therefore it wont cut .I HAVE BEEN a barber for 15 years now n these are the worst machine i have ever bought.</li>
    <li> I spend hours upon hours doing research and watching youtube videos on trimmers. Wasted more time than I should have. In the end, this one won. Other than it being ugly (compared to Wahl), it cuts clean, and gives me excellent lines on my face, which is what I want. It also gets kinda hot after long uses, but given I only use it to shave my head and line up my beard, it&#x27;s not on for that long to get to such temperatures.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Would recommend this product to anyone..</li>
    <li> Dull, cuts me everytime. I oil, clean, maintain and nothing. This wasn&#x27;t cheap either, blegh, NEXT!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like this trimmer.  Its not smooth.  Just doesn&#x27;t get the job done.  Want to return it !!!!!!</li>
    <li> I mean im a barber and these are what im used to...they are good you can tweak them to your personal likeing so they are good</li>
    <li> I was at a place where I was done with paying to get my hair cut. I asked around and even surveyed some barbershops---andis T Blade is the go to device for edging and I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
    <li> I had been looking around for these clippers for quite a whie and everywhere I found them they were really expensive. Found them on Amazon (at a great price), ordered them and received them faster than I expected. Been a happy - well groomed - guy ever since!!</li>
    <li> These work well. I still need to get the blades aligned to get that crisp sharp line needed for swag.</li>
    <li> because this clipper is not good at all!  It is a buzzer-style clipper with very heavy vibration. It can be uncomfortable to hold. I found it best to use a firm finger tip grip - not a deep in the palm hold.  Yes, the case does get very warm. I have lost one of the case screws.  It must have been vibrated loose or loosely attached at the factory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper starts with a very loud click and buzz.  Compared to other vibrating-style clippers, it is a very loud device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cut is definitely not suitable for shaving.  I was not expecting razor close but this does roughly a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  This may be okay for you if you have a particular problem with ingrown hairs from curly hair when it is cut too short. If you are very blonde, it may be okay also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For older men, especially if your hearing is starting to go, this is a good length for the ear/nasal hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers cut better new than now - about 50 cuts/trims later. They don&#x27;t pull the hair but the cut was closer.  My hair is thick and coarse.  I never could just dive in with this device.  I have to nibble and cut from several directions to get an adequate cut.  This is true even when I am simply edging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I was upgrading when I bought these.  Previously I was using battery-operated clippers (boc). The battery life was good with alkalines. I was using rechargeables so battery life was not a problem.  I thought that if the boc was good, then the Andis would be great!  I was wrong.  The closeness of the cut is definitely better with the boc.  They gave adequate electric razor quality closeness.  The heft and feel (minus the vibration) is better with the Andis.  The boc are not as much toy quality as I thought. They cut closer, are quieter, cut more consistently than the Andis!!!</li>
    <li> My son loves these clippers. Great quality.</li>
    <li> Outliner is all that I expected it to be</li>
    <li> Perfect for shape ups &amp; beards !!</li>
    <li> These are great trimmers that give you close shave. Very good for detailing and styling beards. I have owned it for 3 years now and its been working perfectly from day one.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t buy things that I don&#x27;t like or love!</li>
    <li> This is actually my 2nd time of T-Outliner trimmers... the first pair was stolen from my car :( ... and I must say, if you want crisp edges and line ups, there is really no alternative to these! after the first set were stolen i bought a cheaper Andis set (wont say any names...) and they were serviceable, but didn&#x27;t really give the \\&quot;Wow\\&quot; factor that a crisp line up can give to a haircut. I have aspirations of being a professional barber, and I currently have a few clients as well as my own hair that i cut... they definitely appreciate look from this Andis T-Outliner over the other I have.. and I feel more confidient with my cuts using these. I definitely recommend these to the anyone from the Professional barber to the one just wanting to save some money and do the work himself!</li>
    <li> Sold me a USED not New Trimmer as stated. The trimmer smelled as thought it had burned up and was then later repaired. Very hard to get a burned smell out of something. I got my trimmer in the mail and right away noticed that the packaging was suspect. There wasn&#x27;t even a piece of tape holding the top or bottom flap of the box together. When I picked it up I noticed part of the metal holder that holds the blade on was broken on one side. There was no extra blade at all in the box and no  product registration card. There was a trimmer and a 1/2 tube of oil. The plastic bag containing the trimmer was not sealed. The blade was also was scratched. One of the screws holding in the blade was somewhat clearly worn as though the blade had been taken off numerous times.This is clearly a used Trimmer and not New. Who is refurbishing these things and selling them full price to amazon who then sells it to me? Photo enclosed.</li>
    <li> I own two of these clippers.  I have been using them for 5 years now and have replaced the blades once, i didn&#x27;t need to, I wanted to.  If your looking for a close shave without the razor, this is for you.  It&#x27;s good for cutting your facial and head hear.  It trims very well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is also great becuase it is durable, easy to clean, compact, not loud at all.  If I loved it anymore, I&#x27;d have to leave my wife.  Buy it, you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> This product is ok, the shave is not as closed as I would like it to be, but for the price it gets the job done. Its silver blade give a more effective shave than the golden T-outliner blade. I wish the blade would be thinner, for the price you&#x27;ll be happy make sure to get a cleaner disinfectant at the local hair store or online. It has a long cord which gives you some flexibility with far outlets.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair for the past 5 years.  These are by far the best trimmers. So close, you&#x27;d think it was razor. The T shape blades are the icing on the cake, if you have an ugly hairline, and you need a shape up/lineup often. Do yourself and your wallet a favor, get these trimmers. so easy to use.</li>
    <li> Still go mine from 2004 still using it&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mess with anything else</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and results.  Feels solid in your hand and cuts close and precisely.</li>
    <li> One of the best but dont drop it! I replaced the blade twice and third time it would not work properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend but not for long time use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a hairstylist for over 20 years. I&#x27;ve owned only one other trimmer in that time which finally died so with some research I decided on this one to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high expectations because of all of the positive reviews and it&#x27;s ok, nothing special.  IMPORTANT:  The gray color stained when I got hair color on it and it will NOT come off.  That was certainly unexpected.  If you care about that sort of thing, you many want to choose this Trimmer in black instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cuts ok,  clean edges with the T- blade.  it&#x27;s pretty quiet, long cord etc.. They just don&#x27;t make tools like they used to. It doesn&#x27;t feel as solid as my old one a wahl from 1990. But that&#x27;s with everything now isn&#x27;t it?</li>
    <li> Worked great for the first month, then it wasn&#x27;t cutting as close, and finally it stopped working all together...not happy at all with the quality...I thought this brand was good, but I guess not.</li>
    <li> This product works perfectly. It is as its reputation indicates.</li>
    <li> Trims very easily and cleanly.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s the same thing my barber uses. As good as it gets. Close shave, and has a long life!</li>
    <li> I purchased a Andis Clipper &amp; Trimmer set (read my review) but the trimmer was trash so i had to go and order this T-outliner.  Needless to say this product by far exceeds the previous purchase and i should have just bought this from the get go.  Obviously it is a tool of choice among barbers and there are enough reviews on here to back the claim of a good clean line up.  One thing to notice though for those overseas like me...because the product is 110 volts and many overseas locations work off 220 volts i had to open this thing up and adjust the power/tension screw (not sure the name) to make it work the way it should.  And as a note...it is 110 volts NOT dual voltage...i had it hooked up to a transformer...but anyways it took a good 30 mins for me to tighten/loosen/check to make sure that it cut properly but at the same time wasnt too loud or didnt vibrate too much.  Those that need to do the same can find a barber to help them or you can adjust it yourself as it is very easy.  Great product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;After further use the t-outliners shake and vibrate too much BUT blame it on being overseas and the transformer at my house only converts the 110v to 220v.  It does not convert the cycles.  american products use 60hz and europe uses 50hz so this product although great stateside is not a good choice for overseas.</li>
    <li> These are the best liners! Came in a week and i was satisfied!</li>
    <li> These clippers are truly awesome. I shave my head every 4 days and they get very close. I have gone through several sets of clippers and its always hard to find a set that lasts. These are professional quality.</li>
    <li> This is sooooo noisy....after the first use it just got loud and its vibrating harder than a truck engine under pressure.....And I have never dropped it....This is the first and last time I will be getting one of these...</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic device, if you want to line up your beard, you must get this no matter what!</li>
    <li> I use this to get a nice close cut on my scalp. It is fast, good weight, and has a nice balance in the hand. It is the closest shave I have found without going to a razor.</li>
    <li> They work great thank you</li>
    <li> These puppies cut clean, been very happy with them for a while now. I use them to shave my face and do line ups on my neck.</li>
    <li> i bought this trimmer after reading all of the positive feedback.  i am not impressed.  it does not cut as close as people say, so i tried oiling the blades, and still no luck.  try one of the other andis trimmers...</li>
    <li> it works very well for its purpose.</li>
    <li> Well packaged and Brand new. Arrived way ahead of schedule. Working just as expected, amazing product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I use this trimmer for primarily beard trimming. It is a very close cut.  It does an excellent job of lining up my beard.  However, the T blade may be too wide and a regular blade is fine.  Also, there are no trimmer attachments that fit this blade for my desired beard length.  Other than this, very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> As all clippers, the blade is a little dull but after constant use and oiling the blade sharpens and works like a charm!</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. Cuts close and help avoid razor bumps. Love it! !</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing products through Amazon for a long time and I RARELY write reviews, but this just has to be reviewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a lot of good feedback for this shaver and I also saw it on the top of the list for many heavy duty beard trimmers, so I thought I would give it a shot.  Unlike many of the reviews said, my packaging was fine, it even came with a replacement blade and oil for maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;But as I was reading through the manual on the maintenance portion, I found it said that you need to oil the blade before, DURING, and after each time you shave.  The word DURING was even in bold?!?! Really? So I should just be smearing oil all over my face?! Thought I should give it a shot anyway.&lt;br /&gt;NOPE, didn&#x27;t even let the thing touch my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I turned it on, it emitted one of the loudest buzzes I&#x27;ve ever heard.  Loud enough that my roommate, in his room, on the other side of the house was like &amp;#34;WHAT WAS THAT?&amp;#34;  If you&#x27;ve ever played the game &#x27;Taboo&#x27; and remember the buzzer for it, its like that, but 10 times louder.  It was so unnaturally loud, I thought a couple of the screws might be too tight, causing it to vibrate too much. NOPE. Thats just the noise it makes.  It is literally loud enough, that if held to my face, my ears feel like I just got out of a heavy metal show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you would like to be partially deaf, wake everyone on the block up, while smearing your face with oil; please, buy away</li>
    <li> Is doing A great job...just as seen on add.</li>
    <li> It works for a while and then stop working,</li>
    <li> My second trimmer and it last forever. I&#x27;ve had the first one for about 9 years. Cuts great and requires little maintenance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these trimmers for 2 years now and have no need to see my barber anymore. The price is reasonable and you more than make up for it in less than 3 months by trimming your own facial hair and trimming edges. If you&#x27;re like me and like to cut it all off every now and then, they cut pretty close without scratching and no irritation.</li>
    <li> I have owned these trimmers for about two months and used five times they are good for edging and trimming possibly something better out there, but at this price they are fine. Good construction of trimmer they feel very powerful and I haven&#x27;t had any overheating issues with trimmer but I&#x27;m only using them for myself for personal use so they&#x27;re only running about 20 minutes max when I use. good product</li>
    <li> Excellent clippers. Has a great cut. Cuts even better if you adjust the blade.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, great price, and works well</li>
    <li> I have gone through 2 Wahl groomsmen and one Norelco trimmer.  The batteries go bad and it costs almost as much to have them replaced as to buy a new trimmer.  This is the same as my barber uses all day, every day, and he replaces it every few years.  This one should last me almost forever using it once a day at most.  The closeness of the cut is far superior to the others I have had.  I just leave it plugged in and hang it on a hook on the side of my bathroom cabinet.  This makes it more convenient than a cordless, and there is no expensive battery to go bad.  In general, professional tools do the best job, and this one is no exception.</li>
    <li> I use this to shave my face on those days that I don&#x27;t feel like dragging a razor blade across it.  It gets almost to the skin.  I can not say enough good things about this trimmer. If you can&#x27;t shave each day, because of bumps and irritation, then this is for you. Don&#x27;t even bother trying other trimmers; I have tried them all and finally found the best.</li>
    <li> These clippers are the best clippers i have found so far. They cut great. They are mainly for lining up beards,&amp; your hair. The only bad part is boy do they get hot. Mines get so hot to where as you can see a burn mark so you have to time yourself to do a quick lining within 5 minutes tops or watch out.</li>
    <li> Awesome, the best for outlines...</li>
    <li> Great product and it works.  I bought this product because this is the same product that my barber uses.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST, trust me, when it comes to close shave, without the bumps and worry about if your getting a close shave, i am very impress with this machine, if you guys are wondering if you should buy this, Don&#x27;t worry this will do the job and so much more, thanks amazon, pleasure doing  bussiness with you!!!!!!</li>
    <li> These trimmers are used for lining up your hair, these are not for fading or cutting the hair on top of your head. The black guards advertised above wont fit on these because they&#x27;re edgers. Guards are used for those other trimmers, the ones that are used for cutting most of your hair. My dad has owned these for awhile now; since im going to college in a few weeks, i decided to go ahead and order my own. These do get hot as due most clippers, thats not a problem though. Blades will have to be changed every once in a while, i never noticed them dulling out but my dad did. If you&#x27;re looking for some nice edgers to line up your edge up these are GREAT.If you&#x27;re trying to cut your own hair, you&#x27;ll need these plus another pair of trimmers. Get the trimmers that come with guards, those are what you&#x27;ll need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re looking to cut your own hair. GET THESE AND THE OTHER KIND OF TRIMMERS.(they&#x27;re only 2 kinds, several different brands)</li>
    <li> Terrible product! heats up, and gets smokey, within seconds of being turned on, screws come undone when turned on making the plastic body come off and also very noisy. I returned one and got a replacement yet the same problem, it seems they&#x27;re all like this. My replacement even came with brown marks like it was dirty or previously used, i am infuriated. A complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Love, Love Love these trimmers!!!</li>
    <li> If your fed up of paying &amp;10.-20. for a haircut purchase these clippers, they will save you  a few years of hair cuts if not delay having to go every two weeks to the barber.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done. No issues so far.</li>
    <li> Jus like at the barber shop.</li>
    <li> The Andis pofessional 04710 is a superb tool manufactured right here in America.  Its performance has exceeded my expectations in that my after shave life is now painless and enjoyable.  I am experiencing no shame showing my well shaved face to the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tool ended over 40 years of misery for me caused by my in-grown beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Andis 04710 has been a superb buy. I,ve assigned it a 5-star rating.</li>
    <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
    <li> mine arrives defective ,,, I got bored with  i carry it with a stylist who try it. and told me that mine does not work, put new blade and even uncut fine</li>
    <li> This is one of the best edgers/ trimmers I have come across. it gives a close cut without being too over powering. I just started cutting my own hair and I must say, people can&#x27;t tell the difference between a professional cut or mine&#x27;s. I have recommended to my co-workers; after taking a look at my cut, made believers out of them. this is one trimmer you need in your arsenal if you plan on cutting your own hair.</li>
    <li> My favorite.  Work great every time!</li>
    <li> Andis only way to go.</li>
    <li> The box the trimmer was is was all messed up. When I opened them, they had hair and oil all over it, this product is 101% used. It say&#x27;s \\&quot;New\\&quot;, but really is not. The clippers is a rip off. They charge $48, just take and etra $25 and go get a BRAND NEW one with lifetime warranty. The trimmer cuts ok, but not like it should. I do not recommend this if you want to cut hair with a straight, crisp line. GO TO THE A BARBER STORE AND GET A BRAND NEW,  MEAN BRAND NEW ONE FOR $60 WITH A LIFETIME WARRANTY.</li>
    <li> I purchased these so I could get a nice crisp finish on my son&#x27;s hair.  The trimmer works great so far.  I wanted professional quality so I don&#x27;t have to keep buying new trimmers.</li>
    <li> Broke after two uses. Very disappointed in this purchase but Amazon has been great.</li>
    <li> I finally got my T Outliner. Use it for a week and it has worked very well just like all the barbers use in their shops. Of course it&#x27;s going to get a little warm, IT&#x27;S A MOTOR!!! It is not very loud nor does it vibrate heavy. IT&#x27;S A MOTOR!!! What do you expect for it to do? I also got the Andis Speedmaster and its just as quiet and gets warm. And I also went to the barbershop that has the Osters and Wahls. It conducts heat like any clipper. Do not let the bad reviews deter you. If you let a car run too long, wouldn&#x27;t the engine get hot over time? The same thing for the clipper. It didn&#x27;t break on me and works very well! Recommend it to all that wants to start cutting hair</li>
    <li> It breaks all the time and doesn&#x27;t come with replacement blades</li>
    <li> cuts very well, and i will soon purchase replacement blades....</li>
    <li> The clippers perform better than I could have image.</li>
    <li> The product does what the description says. Professional quality. The comb attachments advertised with the trimmer do not fit. Two different sets were purchased and they do not fit the trimmer.</li>
    <li> These bad boys work great!  The trimmer head is much wider than the last few rechargable trimmers I have used so it trims much faster and it trims very close, much closer than my previous trimmers as well.  The only thing I dont like is that it gets pretty hot after a few minutes of use. I use it to shave my face and the back of my neck, would highly recommend</li>
    <li> This shaver works great for shaving the backs of my husband&#x27;s and son&#x27;s necks.  This way, they don&#x27;t look sloppy until their next haircut.  It shaves close without pinching.</li>
    <li> This is called a trimmer and not a clipper, and I can definitely see why.  It works fairly well, but it&#x27;s definitely not designed to cut a lot of hair quickly.  It does cut pretty close to the skin, however, so it worked great for me.  I don&#x27;t like shaving my neck, but I don&#x27;t want visible hair there, so this was a quicker solution.</li>
    <li> Outliners work great! Need to stock up on blades to keep handy. Thanks</li>
    <li> Great for trimming but can get hot fast. One of my favorite trimmers.</li>
    <li> My problem with it is that it doesn&#x27;t fit any comb attachements with this blade.  I had to buy another blade (ANDIS One Outliner II Blade Set (Model: 04604-GO)) in order to use the comb attachements.  On top of that, there are only four comb attachments available through Andis for this model.  That being said, it works really well and I am still relatively happy with my purchase (though it took a while and a lot of work...)  This is a really nice trimmer.  It works SO much better than the others I have had over the years.  It cuts better, closer and is more quiet.</li>
    <li> bought this mugg off amazon cuz sallys was askin for 60. got mine in about three days, and it works beautifully. it is an essential for anyone trying to become a barber, or for anyone who just loves cutting hair. i have given three of my friends fades since ic gotten this. ussually givin the line up is the longest part for me since my old trimmer was janky. these cutt it in half the time. buy these</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d recently purchased these trimmers and was happy with the quality. I was pleased with how well they remove the facial hair. They are superior to most other brand of trimmers on the market today. what I like most about these trimmers is that you can order replacement parts, when the need arises.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the item.</li>
    <li> i only use it to line myself up, a quick couple of minutes. so i don&#x27;t have the over-heating issue most people have cause i don&#x27;t use it that long. so, it&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer ever, I use it as an alternative to bic&#x27;ing my head. It&#x27;s such a close cut, comes loaded with the T-outliner (quadruple 0) blade. I can trim my face and head all without it getting too hot to handle before finishing the job. The last one I had lasted 5+ years and the only reason I replaced it was because I dropped it and the internal blade alignment was permanently damaged, or else I don&#x27;t doubt it would have lasted another 5+...</li>
    <li> Great item to do my lineups and edges with. Andis makes a great product and would total recommend this outliner to and barber.</li>
    <li> I have worn a beard for many years. Most of the trimmers that I have used have been barely adequate. This one is far beyond - smooth operations. It&#x27;s a good find.</li>
    <li> This is the best trimmer ive ever had. its light, fits well in the hand, its powerfull and sharp. it cuts sharp out of the box and doesnt hurt. not even on the nape. but anyways you can adjust the blade for it to be sharper but be carefull as it might hurt. the only downside of this machine is that it gets really really hot after 30 minutes of non stop use. but you can spray[[ASIN:B000LNB8HK Andis Cool Care Plus for Clipper Blades]] on it and it will cool it down  in a few seconds. i defenitly recomend it and its worth the price.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t regret getting these clippers. Works great with course hair. I used the Andis Beard trimmer and didn&#x27;t like it. This one is wayyyyyy better.</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES this trimmer!  Best trimmer he has ever had totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> These are actually built very well, and durable trimmers. They cut close, and give a very precise line. I got these to begin cutting my own hair and I am extremely pleased with this purchase. I live Overseas in Germany, and due to the power source they are very loud and they shake profusely. I do not recommend unless you have a step down converter that also changes the frequency to US spec. When used with the specified power however, they are whisper quiet.</li>
    <li> Can no go wrong with the andI T-outliner. I received them in mail much quicker than I anticipated. Didn&#x27;t have to adjust them. Any barber, particularly inexperienced ones, need to own at least one pair</li>
    <li> works good better tan a rechargeable  trimmer...</li>
    <li> i got this thing so i don&#x27;t have to go to the barber every week , but i still do ! works great when you know what you&#x27;re doing...</li>
    <li> This product had been used before I received it. Hairs were locate on the blade of the trimmers. I recommended everyone to thoroughly look at this item before purchasing it. Beside the issue of the condition of the product these clippers are ok</li>
    <li> Easy to use and maintain.  Works well, but sharper blades would be an improvement.   I have to make several passes before sufficient amounts of hair are removed.</li>
    <li> Shipping speed was great; product new &amp; works great</li>
    <li> It was not what I expected.  Your ad was wrong.  I returned it</li>
    <li> I am a white male, and I am extremely prone to razor bumps and ingrown hairs.  I have tried many different traditional razors, including both the Mach3 and an old-fashioned safety razor with double-edged blades.  In addition, I have tried both rotary and foil electric razors.  I even tried chemical depilatories.  All of these resulted in my neck being a complete inflamed mess the next day.  This trimmer actually prevents this.  It obviously does not shave as close as these other methods, so I am left with some stubble.  However, because it does not shave as close, I get none of the irritation that came with the other methods.  My neck is no longer red at all, and I discover maybe one ingrown hair each time I shave.  I am extremely glad I discovered this product for dry shaving.</li>
    <li> Motor died after using it 3 times.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer and the set of combs that Amazon recommends to go with them and the combs do not fit.  Do not buy the suggested combs!  They are made for a different model.  See other comments on the combs page.  We are very disappointed and now don&#x27;t know if this clipper even has combs that go with it.  The Andis site is not very helpful so far.</li>
    <li> Bought for fiancee and he loves it. Works like Steve Harvey said</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Andis product, this is no different. It cuts precise lines in my clients head. I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent t liner very sharp and gives me a stupid straight line up. I strongly recommend to those who cant afford the barbershop!!!!</li>
    <li> Disappointed in performance</li>
    <li> I mainly used these clippers to shave my bald head with. Before buying these clippers I read reviews. But trust me if you are bald and doesn&#x27;t want to used a razors to shave. BUY THESE CLIPPERS! They get razor close. Make sure you adjust/align the blades for best results.</li>
    <li> They cut perfect but get hot pretty quick, if you dont let them cool off it will leave a burn mark.</li>
    <li> There alright get HOT! Waaay to quick.</li>
    <li> This is a very good hair line trimmer. Extremely sharp blades when purchased new , be careful. Excellent housing and casing, ergonomic hand grip. Quality as most ANDIS products are, again very satisfied. This trimmer seems very durable I dont believe i will have to purchase another for 10 years easy. Very Satisfied.</li>
    <li> This tool is more than what I expected&lt;br /&gt;Did a number on me.&lt;br /&gt;Really Sharp comparing to my first.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> My son wants to become a barber someday and he wanted this particular trimmer. When he received it he was very happy. Thank you for the prompt delivery and quality of product!</li>
    <li> I delayed entering a review to make sure the trimmer was used numerous times with no malfunctions or adjustments.  I&#x27;m pleased to report the Andis T-Outliner Trimmer has performed nicely and is one of the best purchases I have made on amazon.  The delivery was not bad either, two days.</li>
    <li> Hubby enjoyed his gift.</li>
    <li> Great Reliable Product!</li>
    <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned. It was brand new with no signs of use like others have said about their product. It needed no adjustments and it cuts great!</li>
    <li> i just got this 2 days ago. i love using it....heavy and strong. cut my mustache,beird my hair very clean and neat...very good in lining hairs tapered and etc...wire is thick, cant tangle it or break it. goood good piece! buy it folks</li>
    <li> Clippers work just as i had wished, great for touch-ups and linings. can use for shaving as well, with minimal to no irritation. can heat up if on for too long, but that is avoidable, all and all is a great buy that does exactly what it is needed for</li>
    <li> This hair liner does a nice job, but the blade is not sharp enough to give me that crisp, barbershop hair line.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> I got these clippers because my barber was using them to clean my fade up and I was impressed by how my fade lasted an extra couple of days before needing a fresh cut.  The only con which is not really a con is I wish I new the guards for my other Andis trimmer the (LS2)fit this model.  The reason I was shopping for trimmers is because my LS2 broke when it was dropped.  Then I saw this as an opportunity to get these but they don&#x27;t come with guards so I bought these and another pair of LS2&#x27;s.  Come to find out the LS2 guards fit these.  I could have used my old LS2 guards instead of buying a new LS2 trimmer.  If you have Andis trimmers the guards may fit this model too...FYI.</li>
    <li> after unpacking then tryin to use it wouldnt shave because the blade is dull. Unfortunate for me i live in the caribbean so shipping it back would be to expensive so i had to order new blades which would b cheaper for me.&lt;br /&gt;However, the machine was quiet when tried to use it and did not over heat like some people was saying.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t shave very often and I bought these clippers to trim my beard before shaving.  I can only get 50% of my face before the clippers stop working.  I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;re overheating or what.  I&#x27;ve tried oiling the heck out of them, but nothing seems to matter.  Very frustrating.</li>
    <li> i love this trimmer and i use it everyday at work but most come with a defect in the blade so its a hit or miss.. when its good its great when its bad it barely cuts the hair..</li>
    <li> The Andis Professional T-Outliner Personal Trimmer appears to be of sturdy quality with good general overall appearence. It was initially ordered to replace an older maodel and has since met all my expectations and has replaced my hair trimmers as an all around groomer. This trimmer satisfactoraly handles all of my grooming needs as well as others in my household. I have personally found this model trimmer to perform better than some other brands that promised the same in the past but have never delivered.----I have since packed them all away; making room for my Andis Trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mostly all praises for this trimmer with the only con being that the trimmer cannot truly be adjusted to trim bald/at skin level as it sometimes leaves some stubble at the surface and around hard to reach areas that I would rather have smoother. A small complaint yes, but overall a great performer day in day out and is perfectly adequate for any hair type.----Did I mention, no irritation from the trimmer blade either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for a quick line-up and trim around the ears, mustache and sideburns, I would recommend the Andis Professional T-Outliner Personal Trimmer to anyone looking for a quick &amp; easy, reliable trim or shave to expedite their day.</li>
    <li> I would like to take the time and indicate that the recent item that I have purchased not only has saved me a bi-weekly rate of heading to the barber shop but has left me with a professional look in the comfort of my home. All I got to say is that the more you practice something, the better you get at it - an example is cutting your hair with this flawless machine in the comfort of your home. I highly recommend this item to anyone that feels like same way I do about cutting hair and trying to save money in the long run.</li>
    <li> Pros: Near perfect edges, comfortable in hand  Cons: Can get moderately hot with prolonged use.   Time with item: 3 weeks    This is a great trimmer. I cut my own hair, but have had trouble keeping my hairline crisp in the past. Not anymore. This is only second to a blade, in my opinion, for tightening up the edges of my head and beard. It&#x27;s also great for dry shaving. I have sensitive skin and cannot use a blade, because of razor bumps. I use this to outline and shave around my beard about every other day and I&#x27;ve had no problems with irritation or bumps. This trimmer does tend to run hot with prolonged use, but not so much that I can&#x27;t comfortably and easily use it. All in all, I&#x27;m most definitively glad I purchased this.</li>
    <li> The Andis Pro T-outliner is amazing, I do line ups and hair cuts all the time and this trimmer is one of the best close shave trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned. The cuts are so fine that it is almost as good as the straight razor that I own. All in all, great product made in America to support our country and give more jobs for the American citizens!</li>
    <li> The clippers are great to use.  They are easy to handle and cut cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process on Amazon was quick and efficient.  I will use Amazon again to purchase other merchandise.</li>
    <li> Great I totally love it came on time I use this item every day and works great  told my friends to get it</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband. He says it works great.</li>
    <li> precision made and works accordingly , just keep it oiled and it will last a life time .</li>
    <li> They shipped the item with broken teeth on the trimmers. I am currently in afghanistan and its not worth it to send the clippers back because of, time consumption and money being spent. This review is a little late but I just remembered to do the review after cutting myself with the clippers with BROKEN TEETH !!! Maybe you should try a different vendor as these guys might short change you.</li>
    <li> This Andis professional outliner personal trimmer broke after 5 uses.  The moving part is not moving any more, just makes noise.</li>
    <li> easy to use it gives a close even finish whether shaving my face or just lining my hair.&lt;br /&gt;its a proven product to me because i had one before  and its good quality.</li>
    <li> Love the design and feel,&lt;br /&gt;incredible close shave</li>
    <li> The quality you would get from the barber. The only problem, I&#x27;m not a barber. Just need some pratice trimming the side of my head. My son also has a great set of hair to perfect my skills.</li>
    <li> Precision of cutting...the reason that I wanted this particular unit...did not disappoint.  Unlike most bulky personal groomers with , it is extremely easy to see where the head of the trimmer is during personal grooming (i.e. beard).  If not for the issues below, I would have rated it a &#x27;5&#x27; based on this fact alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a well built unit.  Right out of the box, I could tell that it would be a rugged piece of equipment.  However, my enthusiasm was curbed within 30 seconds of turning it on.  It vibrates.  When I say that it vibrates, I mean that it shakes like an impact wrench trying to break free a bolt that&#x27;s seized.  No...I&#x27;m not exaggerating.  I read several reviews before I purchased it that essentially said the same thing.  I don&#x27;t know how a barber could use this thing all day...even if it&#x27;s only for bursts of 1-3 minutes.  For that reason, I would rate it a &#x27;3&#x27;...as far as being a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; piece of equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another complaint that many reviews touched on...it heats up...fast.  With the trimmer on for less than three minutes, it had already started to heat up to the point that it was bordering on being uncomfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two clippers and one other trimmer.  None of those are of the same quality that this one is.  However, none of those vibrate as badly or heat up.  Am I happy that I bought this product?  Yes.  It provided a level of precision for grooming that no other trimmer I&#x27;ve used could accomplish.  That being said, I would keep in mind that: 1. It will vibrate a LOT...as pretty much every review said, and 2. It will heat up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re an individual looking for a trimmer to round out your grooming equipment, this is a good choice.  However, if you&#x27;re a hair cutting professional, I would look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review of Andis Professional 04710.</li>
    <li> I should have rated it 3 stars, but since it one of the best trimmers&lt;br /&gt;on the market, I had to give it 4 stars, let me tell you the reason&lt;br /&gt;why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Pros: 1. I bought at a beauty supply store (not amazon) for&lt;br /&gt;  $30 bucks!!!(at amazon it costs $50)&lt;br /&gt;  2. It great for dry shaving, the best i&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;  It cuts almost as good as a shaving blade; I mean, I don&#x27;t see any facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;  My mustauche and beard hair are TRIMMED&#x3D;SHAVED!&lt;br /&gt;  3. It&#x27;s not made in CHINA! It&#x27;s not made cheaply (original price is $50)Made in usa&lt;br /&gt;  4. Sharp blades, makes your outlines look sharp and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;  5. powerful motor and a nice sized trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;  6. It feels made to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  1. After using it for 5-10 minutes it gets hot; the metal and the handle so get a cloth&lt;br /&gt;  to put around it while trimming or it&#x27;s gonna get too hot to handle.&lt;br /&gt;  2.Be careful how to used the trimmer, if you use the trimmer on a hair spot that hard&lt;br /&gt; too remove and u use the trimmer on that spot too long your gonna bleed. The blades are sharp! The sharp are so sharp that when you put alcohol on your outlines, you feel the burns.&lt;br /&gt;The alcohol made me realize how sharp the blade is and even if you don&#x27;t use it too long, it&lt;br /&gt;can give you invisible cuts-cuts you can&#x27;t see but feel when you put alcohol on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;  3. It&#x27;s gets too hot to be used for body shaving/grooming/trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It&#x27;s a great trimmer! I would recommend it. You can find it at a beauty store for $30 bucks. Don&#x27;t worry about the cons, just know how to used it right so you can avoid the cons.&lt;br /&gt;Besides, razor blades also causes invisible cuts too.  Try it, don&#x27;t like it, return it. But Your lines will be SHARP! Guaranteed!</li>
    <li> 10/10 sharp broke them in on the second use.</li>
    <li> These are the best trimmers ever! There seem to be some out there that say these get too hot! Man up for a change.  They get warm, not hot. I get mine done with speed and efficiency.  These get very close. I can&#x27;t use a blade, the bumps and bleeding is too much.  Since I have been using these trimmers, my out breaks are almost not worth mentioning.</li>
    <li> Great!  Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Slim and works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for 6 years now and I&#x27;ve tried many different clippers. I haven&#x27;t seen any others that get as close as these.</li>
    <li> Best liners I&#x27;ve owned and I&#x27;ve only owned another pair, but cheaper, Andis brand liners.</li>
    <li> Thanks, awesome product</li>
    <li> I use this for a close face shave because normal razors mess my skin up and same for electric razers. The blade can be slightly adjusted but be careful because I actually cut myself. Now I have it just perfect for a super close shave. It&#x27;s heavy duty feeling and quality wire. Has lasted a long time now, just remember to oil the blades they get hot and lose their sharpness. Great product</li>
    <li> Awesome clippers. Cut really well. The blade is sensitive to braking with any slight fall though and you&#x27;ll have to buy a replacement. My suggestion is to buy a replacement blade to have handy when it happens.</li>
    <li> Great trimmers! Do need to be adjusted if you want that really razor like edge.  81 people don&#x27;t know what good trimmers are. If you get a used product blame it on the seller not the product. Takes some time to adjust but when you get them right their money every time.</li>
    <li> Andis has been trusted by barbers &amp; regular do it your self guys like myself. It gives a clean sharp cut every time. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I say only \\&quot;near\\&quot; because unless you are a professional barbor, you probably don&#x27;t have the professional technique, but you have the tool of a professional if you own this gem.  This adjusts to allow precise trimming of hair lines and depending on your skill set, you can trim and shape your goatee.  I even shave stubble with mine.  Excellent machine, well worth the price.  This may be your last trimmer(granted you keep it well oiled).</li>
    <li> No cons, several pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two months of use, I would buy it again if I lost this one. Ergonomic feeling and easy to handle. Great moustache and sideburn edger. I even use it for dry shaving if I do not want a skin-close shave. Long electrical cord is an advantage if wall socket is not close by. Easy to clean and maintain. I bought this brand and model because it is the same one that my professional, high-priced hair stylist uses to cut scalp hair.  Based on the apparent quality, I think it is likely to last a very long time if not for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> You just have to have to maintain it and look at the instructional videos so you can have an optimal t outliner, for example the video might show you how to make it sharper for a closer cut and really I use it for personal care and do some cuts for my friends and they like it they want to buy one.</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer from Andis. Cuts clean and close with no nicks to the&lt;br /&gt;skin.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend is a big fan of these clippers and this is the second pair I purchased from Amazon.  The first he threw away but we will not get into that.  He loves these clippers and it does not matter that after using them for some time they get HOT, because this is his third pair.  I love how his face and hair line looks after he uses them. Whenever we visit family I make sure he packs them so he can line up my brothers.</li>
    <li> Very good.My teenager loves it.!</li>
    <li> this is my second one....first one lasted 6-7 years before the motor gave out.  I&#x27;m not a barber, but use it very frequently.  does very close shave w/o using a razor.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality hair clippers, but no good for trimming your beard, as it comes with no accessories (clippers or combs) to trim beard...have to pay $15 more....</li>
    <li> Can this trimmer shave a head bald?</li>
    <li> Very sharp. Happy costumer</li>
    <li> This is my second t-outliner from Andis. I purchased my first one back in 1991 and it finally died at the end of 2014 and trying to be economical I purchased a cheap replacement that I&#x27;ve had since last November. I&#x27;m glad to say I came to my senses and purchased another t-outliner and even if it last half of my first I&#x27;ll be more than pleased.  I use it daily for shaving and tapering my hair line and it lasted nearly 23 years great job and great quality Andis.</li>
    <li> This is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned. I use it to trim my facial hair and hair line to create crisp, clean lines. The only draw back was that I had to take the blade off to adjust it to cut closer. It cut to my satisfaction once the blade was adjusted.</li>
    <li> I have thick facial and head hair. This clipper trims up the brillo I call hair up with ease.</li>
    <li> just what i expected from andis! their products have always been good and this was no disappointment</li>
    <li> My other son is now enjoying your trimmer.</li>
    <li> The greatest trimmers i have ever used. This is the second pair I have owned in 10 years. Fellas, these will get you the ladies. Get yo GROOM on!!</li>
    <li> My husband is very happy with this trimmer! heavy duty and professional, shipped in a timely manner and just as described. much thanks to the seller</li>
    <li> Great saving on a excellent trimmer.</li>
    <li> There good I like them a lot just what I wanted to make my cuts like I wanted them to look</li>
    <li> i really like this little machine.  But in all honestly , other than the look, it really isn&#x27;t much of a closer cut than the base Andis pair of cutters I bought from Walmart for like $25 bucks.  They both cut the same.  They both cut really good.</li>
    <li> best trimmer ive ever used</li>
    <li> These arrived and are the dullest trimmers I have ever owned!!!!  These are a waste of money!!!</li>
    <li> They broke ay too soon.!! But when they worked, they were awesome.</li>
    <li> Loved it!! Worked we&#x27;ll for my husband.</li>
    <li> The person that I purchased it for really likes it.</li>
    <li> The trimmer fits ergonomically in your hand,not heavy &amp; gives you a very close cut. The electrical cord is a perfect length, not to short, not too long! Very low maintenance as well. The Andis Trimmer also came with a perfect pre-set blade. If you choose to set the blade yourself you have a chance to either cut or grab skin or set the blade to far &amp; prevent a close cut!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a pair of these for almost ten years, and I&#x27;ve just had cleaned and sharpened periodically. I&#x27;ll be replacing them next month because the cord has worn out.</li>
    <li> I ordered the trimmer specifically for dry shaving. After trying every method of razor shaving ending up with painful and unattractive razor bumps, I needed a set of sharp close-cutting trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set works just as I needed them to. I get a nicely close shave with no razor bumps to follow. No clippers / trimmers will get you as clean shaven as a razor, but the Andis Trimmer works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great product, Near razor close shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;No storage bag. The blade was blemished. It looked like the unit was expsosed while sitting on a shelf. Too lazy to complain and send the unit back, I used rubbing alcohol to clean the blade and the trmmers worked just fine.</li>
    <li> been to wallmart, been to target and even wallgreens and have bought their crappy hair trimmers for years.  this time i decided to do it for real and really look for a quality pair of clippers.  after reading for a while this model came up a few times and decided to give it a try, lucky me.  it feels solid, runs great and works exactly as i had hoped.  gets super close to the skin and haven&#x27;t felt anything even close to a nick.  i shaved my 2 boys head and their mother freaked out, they were smooth skinned baldies when i was through.  looking for a close shave with clippers?  look no further.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about 7-8 years. I use it to shave my head every saturday. A while ago I notice it wasnt cutting as well, and the handle felt loose. I made sure I oiled up every time but still wasn&#x27;t cutting right. Turns out the screws above the power knob were a little loose. Tighten them up and they&#x27;re good as new.</li>
    <li> One of the best, bought it to line my self. And works perfectly..</li>
    <li> I been using this Trimmer for years and still in love with it!!!</li>
    <li> These trimmers work great. My son uses them for shaving so he doesn&#x27;t get hair bumps and they shave very close. Cutting hair seems to be great too.</li>
    <li> This product is great for shape-ups, line-ups or any type of trimming. I use this for my personal use and it has been a great item along with my other clippers that I have. This is a must have product for any barber. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Excellent product , from responsible business . Andis professional is efficient and durable even when your traveling . But the price could go down more .</li>
    <li> Great for trimming or shaping yourself up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure you adjust the blades if you want a closer shave.</li>
    <li> The packaging was okay not the greatest. But once I got the product open I was very excited and very impressed with the trimmer. I recently started to cut my own hair. It saves lots of money. Gas, Plus tips. Also cut your hair every 2days so it will always be fresh.;-) Love the product 100%</li>
    <li> This clipper is good but I replaced it with the best clippers on the market: http://amzn.to/1K8KQ4B</li>
    <li> I use it as a stubble trimmer. It&#x27;s cuts very close, but doesn&#x27;t shave. Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does vibrate a bit more violently than I would have thought. I&#x27;m no pro, so it may need adjusting. But it does vibrate more than my cheap $20 regular clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great quality.</li>
    <li> The clippers did not work as they should.</li>
    <li> Working great for me took me long to make a desison on some trimmers but these are perfect I get tons of compliment of the clean shaved look</li>
    <li> Great clippers every man should own on his grooming kit</li>
    <li> This is my second Andis T-Outliner Trimmer that I owned. The first one lasted 15 years. It is still running. :)</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000143C0K Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer]]&lt;br /&gt;If you want a close shave like you came from the barber get this trimmer.</li>
    <li> I have used this trimmer three times. So far so good. Great for cutting around the ears, beard , neck line ect. This is a must have trimmer.</li>
    <li> All I can say is WOW...what a difference.  My hubby likes to do \\&quot;at home\\&quot; hair cuts from time to time. He needed me to finish up his neck area.  I bought this trimmer specifically for this purpose to trim neck line better, and WOW this works 1000 times better than our regular Wahl trimmer.  This trimmer gets more precise and clean cuts.  It was well worth the investment.  This really works great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a regular head shaver. So I&#x27;ve tried a few clippers and razors before this one. Generally razors give the best shave but tend to be a bit irritating especially if you have sensitive skin and clippers don&#x27;t give as clean a shave as I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was recommended to me by a few people because i kept getting the shaving bumps and irritated skin. I&#x27;ve had it for almost a month now and so far i love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Good close clean shave, comfortable to use it has a good size small enough to hold and move with just enough wieght so you don&#x27;t need to press hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: i only have one issue and it&#x27;s that it tends to heat up sometimes i mean it gets hot enough that you have to turn it offand let it cool down for a bit.</li>
    <li> Pefect edge clippers. Shave beard and line hair up without going to the barbershop</li>
    <li> As soon as I turned it on and heard the familiar hum that I heard whenever I got my hair cut at any barber I knew this was the real deal. Although I ordered a Micro Touch Max at the same time for the peach fuzz cuts, this unit cuts close enough it&#x27;s not needed. My stash never looked this good and the ends of the unit eliminate the hair from the nooks and crannies of my large ears.    Professionals may have their pros and cons about this unit but for this lay man, it is nothing but awesome!!</li>
    <li> Love this item. None of the battery operated shavers compare to this. The cut is so much shorter and smoother and actually takes longer to grow back.</li>
    <li> The machine came within 3 days, which I was happy about, but what made me even more happy was that the machine gave me an extremely close shave. I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but none could compare to the Andis. My face was smooth after I shaved. I couldn&#x27;t feel any hair stubs like I usually would with other razors.  It also gave me a very sharp and precise outline, it looked like I just came from the barber shop. It was very easy to use, and it barley gave a sound. It&#x27;s not annoying like other razors would sound. Overall this is a great machine. I can&#x27;t speak for white people, but I do recommend this product to black men.</li>
    <li> The girl who cuts my hair had one of these and she used it to trim my beard. I figured I would just get one and do it myself since I have had a beard for going on 5 years now, but I was skeptical because all of the other beard trimmers I have ever used were pretty flimsy and not very powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little thing packs a punch. And because it is so powerful, there is no need to trim the same spot over and over again. But don&#x27;t forget to buy snap on comb attachments. I use the 3/8 inch snap on to trim my beard every 4 or 5 days. It takes a third of the time it would have taken with my old, fancy-looking Remington. The Remington was nice enough, I could put the Remington&#x27;s blade under water, but it just didn&#x27;t trim very well - especially for the price. The Andis T outliner isn&#x27;t fancy-looking but damn does it work well. I won&#x27;t buy any other trimmer again.</li>
    <li> Trims my husbands hair really well. Be careful the blade is sharp.</li>
    <li> Great razor for basic trimming beards. Cuts quickly with precision with various attachments. Heats up after prolonged use, easily solved by just letting it rest a bit but usually done with trims by then.</li>
    <li> Ordered this around a month ago--Amazon shipped, so I received it fast and in good physical condition. The trimmer looks good and feels solid, but when I plugged it in and tried to use it, I was totally disappointed. I could have done a better job with the cheapest used full size hair trimmer bought at a thrift store. The blades were as dull as a lawn mower used to trim a rock garden. The trimmer was a complete disappointment. The only good part of ordering this unit(if you can consider it good) was that I was amazed at how painlessly Amazon has made it to return a product to them. Very easy to ship back (be sure to save their shipping container as it makes it easier to box and return your product), slap their return label to the box, call for a pickup, and your done.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this item if you are looking for a very good edger that is very precise and sharp. Above and beyond the typical trimmer.</li>
    <li> They were good out the box.  But After using them, I found out they weren&#x27;t as sharp as I wanted or expected.  I adjusted the blade, and now I have what I paid for.  These are great trimmmers.</li>
    <li> As a master stylist I love it!  I use them every day I work in salon. I forever forewent a corded trimmer carver liking for only cordless tools but after dropping the plastic cased t-edger II for many years- going through at the least two of them a year for more than a decade- I decided to go with this model and I couldnt be happier. Still, all this time after purchase, I only clean them with brush and spray and have not had to replace or even adjust the original  blades. Very happy indeed!</li>
    <li> i wanted it to be sharper, but it&#x27;s still able to get the job done.. so i guess im satisfy!</li>
    <li> this is the item when you just want to clean your self up. And with practice you will not be going to the barber as much</li>
    <li> Had this for two years works great</li>
    <li> Learn not to zero out blade and get cooling oil.</li>
    <li> this is a waste of money, get the styliner ll trimmer. I got this product defective  - it vibrates like a jacket hammer, i cannot line up properly due to this. stay away from this product. you have been warned.</li>
    <li> After I adjusted the blade (Zero-Gapping), It cuts extremely close and leaves a very defined outlining/taper just like at the barbershop. Would recommend to anyone who wants a sharper and more defined lining.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer to replace a cheap one because my wife started give my son and I our regular haircuts, I searched for the best T trimmer and was very disappointed with this product, it is very dull and hurts the skin.  I wish I would have returned it.</li>
    <li> Got this for an anniversary gift for my boyfriend. He loves it!</li>
    <li> For those who want excellent professional trimmers, this is the best deal around.  The quality of the product is fantastic.  If I decide to upgrade, i will definitely stick to this brand.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is good, great cutting; it&#x27;s solid and will last. The problem is the combs! Amazon, if you live in Canada, will shipped the trimmer but cant shipped the combs!! What&#x27;s up with that!  I had to call Andis to find the comb product number and finally manage to order them on another web site! There is only one type of comb that fits this trimmer. It&#x27;s great for trimming the edge of your beard or hair but if you are planning to use this product for a clipper or beard trimmer look for the combs first!!!</li>
    <li> The best in its class. I was looking for something to trim my stubble and was going to get one of the cheapo ones. My dad is a professional, unisex barber and he told me to get this exact one and not waste money on something cheaper because otherwise I will have to pay twice when the first one fails or does a bad job. I decided to listen to dad and got this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It is razor sharp, and it stays sharp! It does a wonderful job keeping my face &amp;#34;slightly unshaven&amp;#34; giving me that &amp;#34;manly look&amp;#34;. My girlfriend loves this, and wouldn&#x27;t have it any other way. She hates it when I shave my face bare.... What is wrong with women these days? They want ya to shave your back making you look like a boy instead of a man, but keep your face looking like you&#x27;re a bum please.. Personally I like to be clean shaven, but many times I am too lazy to shave and this keeps my girlfriend happy and lets me be lazy at the same time.</li>
    <li> This product is top of the line.  It will be around when all others fail. Very smooth and close cut. Lightweight and motor is quiet.  Would recommend this product to anyone who wants professional results.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a device that would trim everything - neck, beard, mustache, but unfortunately the Andis T-Outliner is the wrong tool for this.  It&#x27;s OK trimming short hairs where the hair is fairly stiff.  But on beard hair - say 1/2\\&quot; to 3/4\\&quot; long, it just pushes the hair over.  For mustaches, the blade is way too wide to easily trim the line just above your lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as ruggedness, this thing is built like a tank.  It is heavy and solid and houses a heavy high speed motor that could cut your lawn.  The cord is made with a nice soft rubber that flexes easily.  This trimmer is surprizingly quiet.  It vibrates at a very fast pace - your hand gets a massage while trimming your face.  If you push the trimmer flat against your neck while shaving it will massage your neck, but it&#x27;s not necessarily a good or bad feeling - it&#x27;s a high speed vibration.  It comes well oiled and a small tube of extra oil is included in the box.  I bought some extra oil and I predict I&#x27;ll never use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: it&#x27;s well built and OK for what it does, but don&#x27;t plan on shaping your beard or trimming your  mustache with it.</li>
    <li> great product&lt;br /&gt;had one before and this is an excellent replacement&lt;br /&gt;very quiet, sharp and powerful&lt;br /&gt;easy to maintain&lt;br /&gt;great for shaving and outlining</li>
    <li> Very nice clippers....especially for the price.....feels good in the hand....cuts precisely....seems to last forever(durable)....classy and tasteful.....professional quality for sure....BUY IT!</li>
    <li> These trimmers are undoubtedly the most popular in the barber industry. They&#x27;re light, very precise, and durable. A very proven trimmer. The only drawbacks to this trimmer is that it tends to heat up relatively quickly compared to other edgers, but that can be nullified by quick work or a back up trimmer, which most barbers should have anyway. I find them a bit overrated due to the fact that so many barbers use them with such exclusivity that one would get the impression that there aren&#x27;t other trimmers out there that can do the job just as well, if not better. Although It isn&#x27;t my favorite trimmer in my arsenal, the Andis T-Outliner is a proven edger that you absolutely cannot go wrong with. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> These trimmers are the best! The pivot motor is strong and gives a great line-up. Be sure to watch a few YouTube videos on how to properly adjust these  trimmers because if you let the cutting-blade overlap the set-blade you will get cut. I know, I did. FYI, they will get hot after 30 minutes of straight use. but a line-up should not take more the 5 minutes. Most pro&#x27;s have 2 out-liners (2 of any trimmer)for that reason. I strongly recommend these trimmers if you are looking for the professionally cut look.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm; is so light weight and small that i can bring it anywhere with me.</li>
    <li> after 10 minutes, more or less start to get a little hot. but it&#x27;s really good product, very solid.</li>
    <li> I love Andis products. This Trimmer does exactly what i need it to do. I got tired of using a razor on my head, so i wanted a pair of trimmers that would give me a close cut. This item does not disappoint, it does an amazing job. I&#x27;ve already recommended this to several of my friends.</li>
    <li> Best buzzer I&#x27;ve ever used...gets rid of the smallest hairs and is excellent for dry shaving..So glad I got this! PUrchases the ANDIS cool care plus as an add on item to this</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping. Product was brand new, and in the box when i received it. No damages..... I chose this trimmer b/c it is the same one my barber has been using for years. It it extremely sharp and very precise.  My only complaint is that it gets very hot after a while. i would recommend purchasing a rubber enclosure also. Great product!</li>
    <li> I will advice anyone to invest in this clipper. It saves you money on shaving sticks and low quality clippers. I ordered this clipper from amazon including the andis cool care plus, all in one coolant, disinfectant, lubricator, cleaner, and rust preventive. The blade is gentle on the skin so you wont be getting razor bumps. Its does not get too hot and its lighter than I thought. Its really been great so far. I will give it a 100% but again lets see how long last for.</li>
    <li> I am a professional hair stylist and these are one of my favorite trimmers. They cut the hair so close to the skin it is almost like a razor shave. The T-blade helps to get a sharp outline of the hair line. Great for shape ups in between hair cuts.</li>
    <li> As the title suggests, it shocked me the very first time I used it! I turned it on and off a few times but in the middle of doing the job it shocks me and anyone who is in contact with it. This is only my third time using it and I WISH I had purchased another product! Also, the construction of it looks as if someone tampered with it and rebuilt it. Very disappointed! DON NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> No, I am not fully satisfied because it does not cut how I expected, it does not give as close or sharp of a cut as it explained in the details for when I bought it.</li>
    <li> These are the best trimmer I have owned.  They provide a very clean cut.</li>
    <li> I use this on my face to shave.  I used to use razors (good ones) and shaving cream but even the best stuff made my face sensitive, took a long time, and was a little messy.  This thing cuts very close, doesn&#x27;t nick, cut, or hurt at all, and mostly glides over your face.  It doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a razor obviously, but I actually prefer that.  It&#x27;s close enough that it leaves a nice, very short layer of hair on your face (kind of like a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow), and doesn&#x27;t make me look like a child after shaving.  I&#x27;ve got a rather fat face (damn Irish genes) and using this trimmer makes me look a lot better than shaving.  This is also easy to clean, lasts very long, and saves tons of time in the morning.  I bought this 3 years ago and it just barely began to die on me (I think because I haven&#x27;t oiled it in a LONG time).  Either way, for 3 years of daily use minimum on tough facial hair, this is a bargain.  I can&#x27;t recommend this higher.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item six months ago and it worked well for five months and then it stopped working.  Low power.  I am disappointed considering this brand is considered one of the better quality out there.  I would not recommend it.  It does not last long and pricey.</li>
    <li> Love this trimmer.  Use it all the time with great results. Easy to use and clean. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Actually bought this for the dog.  Does an all right job just cutting off the big tangles.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend the original t outliner, because of the capability it has. I been cutting hair for nearly 20 years, and all other trimmers I have used in the past this is the best. These are very simple to adjust, and you can adjust them very closer than any other trimmers out their on the market without injuring yourself. The reason they may get hot so fast is because the way they are adjusted. After the proper adjustments it will stay cooler longer and improved cutting performance too. Again I highly recommend the original t outliners, and there&#x27;s no need to use a razor when you have the original t outliner to use.</li>
    <li> If you do hair like myself, then do yourself a favor and buy this edger! It will be the only one you need.  If  you properly care for it, will last you for years! I tried a cordless one but they never have the same power or results that the T-Edger does. Great buy for the price!</li>
    <li> Since it had good reviews on Amazon, i didn&#x27;t read the product description properly. When it arrived I figured out it has NO Battery i.e. Has to be plugged into a power source for operation.   Since I was looking for a Rechargeable/Battery operated hair trimmer, it was returned.</li>
    <li> Best clippers money can buy</li>
    <li> works great but have to be careful to oil and not drop it or blade will shatter according to instructions.</li>
    <li> Once you adjust the blades right (yes I had to unscrew the bottom blade and adjust it right), it cuts really close like the barber does,  but be careful it&#x27;s really sharp. I love it.</li>
    <li> Shaves close and keeps me sharp</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son and he absolutely loves it. He says it cuts well and shapes how he wants. He liked them so well that he abandoned his old clippers.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer about a month ago and it still trims great. I use it at least twice a week.</li>
    <li> But instead of these, get the Andis Outliner II because you can put attachments on the II but not the Outliner T...These are the real deal. With the 4 attachments for the Outliner II you&#x27;re beard is set. If you want longer or something you need to get these full size metal/plat/chrome looking ones that are about or under $100 on sale! I&#x27;m Middle Eastern and have thick dense hair and it works ok w me, My beard is huge in a few days... so... and my homie who&#x27;s a barber is a brother that hooks up fades and facial hair to all the dudes around the hood. Like up to 10 a day. I have the outlinerII and he has that, the &#x27;OUTLINER T&#x27;, Which is cool for the face more, accurate but cant/wont take any attachments, and da big $100 chrome ones, that has a gang of attachments.  You gotta oil em every coupla days to once a week and you can take off the blade and push it up a tiny bit for a closer shave and can brush the inside. Also fill a cap of rubbing alcohol and put the corner/edge of the clippers in the cap of alcohol and turn it on every coupla weeks, depending how much u use em and ur hair type. That&#x27;ll clean it up nice, after that make sure u oil it. Durable Stuff! But i dunno abt their $10 dollar ones. Yea man the prices on Amazon are the same price as the wholesaler we buy them from. Where fades and fancy facial hair are bein hooked up, their using Andis&#x27;. Check on it. And Amazon got em for the wholesalers price on all these clippers! Check on it and see, they&#x27;re abt $30 more if not a lot more at a mall, beauty shop or whatever.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think this trimmer was worth almost 50$. I&#x27;ve used other t-line trimmer for have the price that worked just as well. didnt cut the hair any closer. So if ur looking for a razor like, 100% hair free trim this is no it.</li>
    <li> I have been a Barber for over 20 plus years and I have tried several different manufacturers trimmers and outliners and I have found that the T Outliner is the best on the market for razor sharp shape ups.  Andis has been in the business of hair clippers for a number of years and in my opinion these Outliners will stand the test of time. I have Andis T outliners for my entire career and I  used one pair T Outliners for over 5 years, I just clean the inside housing of dirt and debry, oil the blades, wash the blades and I might have to adjust the blades depending how who&#x27;s hair you are cutting!  In addition, if you drop your Outliners you can always get parts to get your Outliners up and running again; whether the cord is frayed, cracked housing or just new blades. So I give the T outliner 5 stars plus 1.</li>
    <li> I purchased this trimmer for my husband.  He absolutely loves it!  He no longer has to worry about rechargeable ones not keeping a charge.  He uses this to trim his facial hair and even to cut the hair on his head!  A great trimmer for anyone!</li>
    <li> They work like a charm so far, pretty nice sharp blades also beats a shaver which gave me razor bumps (I am black). Using these puppies i barely get them and if i do, i only have a couple of the mainly because I do have curly hair really good liners as well now all I have to do is find clippers so I can do my own haircut</li>
    <li> For my 20 yo son, and he uses it all the time.Hair and beard I think.</li>
    <li> Cuts really well. No buzzer better than this</li>
    <li> last forever worked awesome it worked perfectly like it said it would I would highly recommend it  if this is something you need</li>
    <li> I have had this product for over 2 years now and decided to come back and review it. The blade is very very loud and get extremely hot when edging my beard and hair. The shell of the unit is made of plastic and the motor inside gets extremely hot to the touch. The 2 blades are separated by a thin plastic or cardboardish material that broke within the first 5 months of personal use. This causes the blades to not align very well at the point of the actual cut. Think of where the teeth from both sides of the blade meet. Since the material is so flimsy made, the teeth don&#x27;t always align very well, and consequently don&#x27;t cut a sharp line around the hair or beard line. This will be the last Andis I ever purchase. Poor construction, loud and hot.</li>
    <li> Great - I&#x27;ve always liked Andis style liners.  This one is a little better that my previous product.  I had a black edge trimmer from Andis (forget the exact model), but this product creates much sharper lines.  It&#x27;s also very light-weight compared to my last set.  Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> One of the best ones that i used</li>
    <li> Well made. Could use a smaller blade for careful work.</li>
    <li> cleanest edge up...worth the money...anyone who knows a couple things about the t outliner knows its a good tool...if its making too much noise or vibration..adjust it!..comes with the new on/ off switch that&#x27;s easier to use...only downsider is it gets hot too fast...</li>
    <li> My fianc&amp;eacute;&#x27; loved his new trimmer!</li>
    <li> Andis has been in my life since my very first hair cut they make amazing liners I finally bought my own even without adjusting they work great I use to shave as a black American male these greatly reduce my chance of razor bumps and ingrown hairs if you need good liners go with andis</li>
    <li> Received these trimmers fast and do the job very well.  I did my own edge up to test them out and they are a must have.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend. He LOVED this trimmer. He uses it regularly. He has had lots of trouble in the past with razor burn, but when using this trimmer his razor burn is almost completely gone. It not only helps with razor burn, but is smoother than other trimmers. It glides over the skin cutting the hair rather than pulling some strands as it goes. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It works well and came in very fast</li>
    <li> Smooth on skin, not rough. Will not cut the skin. My nephew now enjoys his line up when he gets a hair cut.</li>
    <li> I have tried the Wahl Professional 8110 5-star Series Balding Clipper and the Wahl Detailer Powerful Rotary Motor Trimmer neither of which came close as these as far as balding my head. The Wahl Detailer Powerful Rotary Motor Trimmer came the closest out of the two but I would still have to do a few passes to get my head the way I wanted it. With the Andis T-Outliner Trimmer I shave my head in minutes doing basically only one pass. I don&#x27;t use these to shave up my face as I use a straight edge shaver but if you need a pair of clippers to bald your head and do it as fast and as close as possible then get these you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this trimmer due to a recommendation and I don&#x27;t regret.&lt;br /&gt;Altough it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin the way a gillete does, it leaves beard very tiny.&lt;br /&gt;Now I don&#x27;t have irritation problems, my skin is allways ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to get rid of gilletes, blades... you must buy one of this.&lt;br /&gt;Keep it clean and oily and results will be excellent.</li>
    <li> This is the best trimmer i have used so far for shave and line-up. It cuts close without hurting or pulling on skin. I would highly recommend this product for shaving and outlining. Relatively quiet compared to the regular trimmers. However, it tends to get warm after 10-15 of use. I have been using this for more than 6 months and the blade is still sharp. Very Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> In the past i had issues with razor bumps anytime i used a razor on my face, and so i used magic powder which worked good for the most part, but would require that i buy a tin every two months or so- then i got a foil shaver for my birthday and that revolutionized the way i shaved with one one setback- the following morning i could not recognize myself because of how many razor bumps i had. my barber then suggested that i used the t-outliner, and i have not regretted it since.  Pros  Close enough shave, with minimal stubs  Easy to use  Easy on the face  Easily adjustable for closer shave  Cons  Gets hot- but i am not a barber, so i dont have to use it for extended periods- this doesnt bother me that much.   This shaver has fulfilled the requirements for which it was bought- its gives me a close enough shave and is easy on the face as well.</li>
    <li> Work well and sharp.  Clean cut.</li>
    <li> Unsure what to think.&lt;br /&gt;i have used my same pair of andis clippers for two years until I dropped them and the blade broke off. I considered just replacing the blade but I figured I could do that later and have a back up. The new ones in the top left of the picture seem cheap and not made as well as my old pair(bottom left of the pic) they also don&#x27;t match my old clippers or the box, they have a lip around the edge that seems strange. Maybe they changed the style? They work well so far so we will see how they work out... I&#x27;m just not sure if they are of professional quality and will last as such since that is what they claim to be. I am hoping for the best and hoping they aren&#x27;t knockoffs because I could have gone to a professional store and bought them or ordered them from the catalog for the same price or cheaper but I needed them sooner than that.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed !!! Opened the box, looked nice and flash but when I turned it on, the rattling/vibration and noise was just unbearable. The metal bracket piece where the screws are attached seems to not be properly secured/glued (???) on the sides. Obviously slipped past Quality Control on this one.</li>
    <li> I am not a professional barber or some one with experience in cutting hair. Due to my sensitive skin I can not shave with disposable razor blades so I bought these to keep me clean between barbershop visits. They work really well and are the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I have no words, the item describe itself, great product</li>
    <li> I bought these trimmers and I have to say, they are one of the best trimmers I have ever used however, they broke on me about 1 month after I began using them.</li>
    <li> This trimmer was a real surprise.  Strong, quiet, sturdy, and edges the haircut beautifully with crisp, clean lines.  Of all the trimmers I&#x27;ve used over the years in the barbershop, this one really stands out.  A quality product, recommend heartily.</li>
    <li> I use this to outline my beard and it never disappoints. You can adjust the trimmer to how close it trims and is very precise. It leaves you with a sharp lineup. The only problem I have is it can get a little hot after using for about 20min so be careful.</li>
    <li> I had the Outliner II for years, was nice and sharp and the trim felt clean as if I had used a shaver. I use a trimmer to shave because I get bumps from a regular shaver. But then it started giving me an uncomfortable trim, so I wanted to change the blades, then I see that there is the Outliner 4703 which is a higher number. So I get it. Wrong move, higher number does not mean better product. The trim is okay but not clean or close. I have tried adjusting the blades, aligning etc but I can&#x27;t get the same feeling as the Outliner II. I still feel there is layer of hair not cut. Now I have to get another Outliner II since I threw my other one away....</li>
    <li> Perfect!! Best clipper I&#x27;ve owned and I have had quite a few. Only been using it for approx 6weeks, no complaints here.</li>
    <li> This pair is working so far so good. I had the same pair before purchased from elsewhere and the stop working within the same year.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my girlfriend who is a hairdresser in Boston and she is in love with it.</li>
    <li> Watch a YouTube video to adjust the blade and tension spring placement/tension and you&#x27;re good to go</li>
    <li> great job love the trimmer everyone that needs one should get one.</li>
    <li> clean cut every time, no problems at all and it comes with everything to maintain it, just need to brush up on my skillz... lol</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be a new T-Outliner trimmer it was a used one. Also, It did not have the extra T-Blade that come with it.</li>
    <li> Great for shaving your head!</li>
    <li> This trimmers make, lining hair lines an art form and trimming the face is super clean. This is the second pair of these particular trimmer&#x27;s and I approve of the Good Feel A Clean Look give&#x27;s me...thank you</li>
    <li> fantastic fast shipping, great crisp clippers.&lt;br /&gt;Bulky but aslong as you have a firm hand its aweosme!&lt;br /&gt;Leaces a nice crisp straight line!&lt;br /&gt;(Do not adjust)</li>
    <li> The Andis T-outliner works great, lasts for years with consistent lubrication...after use. Highly recommended for everyday and professional applications. thank you</li>
    <li> I never used a better one than this. I am very happy that I knew this Machine and very very very satisfied</li>
    <li> T-Outliner arrived on time and cut very well</li>
    <li> Great trimmer use plenty of oil,And you will be happy.</li>
    <li> Really great!&lt;br /&gt;Does not have the sexy look n feel like others out there, but does its job really well. Needs cleanup every couple of months.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> I like their equipment. This particular product had a mark on the blade. I was disappointed with that but needed the clippers to much  to return.&lt;br /&gt;They should open the product and look at it before they mail it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll preface this by saying I&#x27;m black. I cut my own hair for the most part. The only thing I&#x27;ve never been able to do successfully is line myself up. I can get half perfect and the other side never matches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Andis T-Outliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now see why you should use a clipper that&#x27;s for outlining. This has a very flat and what I call an \\&quot;extended width\\&quot; blade. What I mean by that is that it stretches out beyond the clipper itself. This means less work and less mistakes, plus it&#x27;s easier to get a straight line. It still take a lot of practice but I&#x27;m getting it right more often than not now. My only advice is to start slow. These get extremely close to the skin (that&#x27;s a good thing) but that also means it&#x27;s very unforgiving if you make a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy it, pat yourself on the back. You&#x27;ve just saved yourself a few hundred dollars a year.</li>
    <li> Best edgers ever! These give my son a clean edge! I love them.</li>
    <li> They work nice, but get hot.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time to give lineups and shape myself up! I wouldnt use another product. occasionally will get really hot but if you use the cool care you shouldnt have any real problems!</li>
    <li> The blade works great, but there are no guards to control the length of the cut.  Other than that its a solid tool.</li>
    <li> Worked out fine but not for long. Stopped working 8 month after purchasing.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my boyfriend, and he loves them.</li>
    <li> Use this to shave with a normal to clean up, shave super fast!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through a few of these over many years; and this one seems to be made of Chinesium metal after just a few weeks, as it loudly ground to a halt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oster is working for me now.</li>
    <li> Ive been searching for one of these for a very long time. Only found online. This is the unicorn of all edgers. i use for beard lining or stubble creating. Doesn&#x27;t cut to sharp but perfect for me..</li>
    <li> My husband likes it; however, we assumed it came with a guard which it unfortunately did not. Good product.</li>
    <li> I have had problems with razor bumps for years. These were recommended and have done the trick. The shave is not too close which compounds the bumping issue, but close enough that I have the clean look I want. I am also able to use them for the detailing of the edge work I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great buy, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The t-blade is the best for the $. All others are at least equal in dependency, but cost and weigh more. I am african american and need such clippers to avoid twice-a-week trips to barbers who overcharge for simple shape ups. Guys with low hair, this is the product to buy!</li>
    <li> work good after you set the blades. Quiet motor. I think Andis sells a cheaper trimmer that uses the same blade.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. easy to use. use of t shape blade helps in getting to hard to get areas and also love that you can go up or down with the blade without having to turn it around.</li>
    <li> Everything i wanted in a trimmer and more.  Don&#x27;t forget to order the attachments if needed.  i&#x27;ve place the link below.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002CP4UAC B002CP4UAC]]</li>
    <li> I often break out after shaving and I tried this as a last resort and it is perfect! I wish I had found this years ago because I would have saved a lot on shaving supplies.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Andis.  I prefer the T-Outliner because of the wider blade, but everyone has their own preference.  I&#x27;ll always go with these.</li>
    <li> If you use it once a week this machine will last for about 1-2 years then it will stop working. if you drop it anywhere in the sink it will stop working. if you replace the blade it will never shave the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as far as for shaving, it does excellent job for trimming and even full shaving.</li>
    <li> Nice Straight clean lines.</li>
    <li> On time will order again</li>
    <li> Work good , but it get hot.</li>
    <li> Best clippers for line ups..... my sons is always fresh and Dad has more money in the pocket ;)... win win</li>
    <li> This trimmer is great. It is very sharp, quiet and of high quality. With a couple drops of oil on the blades after each use it will last forever.</li>
    <li> So far the boyfriend loves it. I got it with the clipper oil because his barber uses a similar one and always uses clipper oil before and after each shave.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that would allow me to shave w/o shaving all the way.  I get crazy irritation and itching when I smoothly shave plus I don&#x27;t really like how I look that way (though my wife does).  In any case, I used to use a beard trimmer w/o the combs to get a stubble look.  In the last several months that trimmer (an older norelco) got to the point where it was pulling hair more than it was cutting it.  In any case, after looking at various Norelcos, Remingtons etc, I found this beauty.  I remembered that when I&#x27;m at the hair salon, they always use some sort of cutter that I really enjoy and i always wonder why can&#x27;t i just shave with that?&lt;br /&gt;Well, turns out I can!  This machine feels fantastic in the hand, and the vibration and noise is actually a lot less than my old norelco.  The vibration is also curtailed if you don&#x27;t have a death grip on the machine and let your fingers absorb some of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get a very short 5 oclock shadow look when shaving against the grain and a bit longer when going with.  One problem for me specifically is that my hair grows sideways .. so i can&#x27;t shave up-down .. i gotta go right-left, which really sucks but this little gem of a machine makes it a cinch!  oh and it&#x27;s a TON quicker than my old beard trimmer.  The fact that the blade can be replaced is just icing on the cake.</li>
    <li> Husband used to go to his favorite barber, Frank, every Saturday morning, but when Frank retired he was unhappy with the new guy&#x27;s touch.  Asked me to give it a try on keeping his balding hair trimmed to his assertive Kojak look.  Who me??  Researched Amazon reviews, and this T-Outliner seemed to be the thing, -- add me to the list of fans.  Very easy to give a close professional looking trim without fear of cutting or causing razor burns, even around ears and neck wrinkles, especially with the help of the Powder Neck Duster that I also purchased at this time.  I do follow advice rendered by others and with instructions to keep blades well oiled and cleaned after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And really appreciate the tip that I get for the service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned my Outliner for 9 years and it still does a magnificent job.  Granted, I&#x27;ve replaced the blades several times due them dulling, but the motor is still running strong.  I usually purchase blades at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.  They run about $40.  Since I only cut my hair, I can get away with purchasing replacement blades once every 3 years.  However, if you&#x27;re using the outliner everyday, then you should probably replace the top and bottom blade every 12-18 months if you want to keep looking fresh.</li>
    <li> Fianc&amp;eacute; wanted for Christmas and he&#x27;s been very happy with it. Thank you</li>
    <li> This the second clipper I purchased, it worked so good for me, I bought this one as a gift, and it was well received!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know which shaver to buy at first. I chose this brand and it is almost as good as the barber&#x27;s shave. Very satisfied and I bought it at a good price.</li>
    <li> This is my second one of this model that was recently replaced after more than 10 years of use.  Solid and well built.  See you again in 10+</li>
    <li> Andis has not let me down.  My old pair lasted forever and the repeated drops finally took its toll. But now I&#x27;m back. Word to the wise, if you&#x27;re cut stops getting close, your blades are dull. These are my husbands words</li>
    <li> Works perfectly! The barber I go to uses these trimmers and now I can clean myself up between haircuts! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is my second T-Liner and I have to say I have never been more disjointed. I&#x27;m not sure whether amazon sold me a used one or Andis is just selling defective products, but I have used this hair clipper roughly 6 times within the last two months and this last time it made a loud vibration and stopped cutting the hair.  I read blogs about it and tried a few simple adjustments but nothing worked.  This is definitely just not worth the money anymore considering how quickly it can break and the fact that you wont be able to return or get a proper replacement....</li>
    <li> This is a great tool for close trimming, but make sure you check it upon receipt. Mine had a snapped blade, and amazon replaced it quickly. But make sure you check because I see a lot of reviews saying things like this, some shipped are defective in some way. Great trimmer though.</li>
    <li> This item must be great in USA however, for the European market trimmer is extremely noisy. (due to power differences)</li>
    <li> The blade cuts and as much as I tried I couldn&#x27;t adjust it. Instead I went back to using the trimmer this trimmer was bought to replace.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! bought it for my boyfriend for a Christmas Gift.  He loves it. No complaint so far. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Excelent choice, I have no complaint</li>
    <li> So far so good! I&#x27;ve had the clippers for a couple months now and have used them once a week on the hair and the face. They cut like a sword. It will slice your hair down to the smoothness of a babies bottom. Only thing negative is the blade literally gets as hot as an iron on blast</li>
    <li> Straight to the point, this is 1 of the best things I ever bought. It has saved me many times from having to go to the barber by prolonging the visit a week or 2 sometimes. I use these clippers only to shave my facial hair. I am no barber nor do I use this for anyone else&#x27;s head besides mine. With a clean look I give myself I don&#x27;t look scruffy as if I have to go to the barber asap, so this is such a big convenience that I don&#x27;t regret AT ALL.</li>
    <li> The Outliner was a Christmas gift for my grandson. After opening his gift, he disappeared (to the bathroom) and used it immediately. He came sauntering out to show off the job he had done. He said, &amp;#34;Now I don&#x27;t have to pay the barber all the time.&amp;#34; So, it was definitely a hit!</li>
    <li> Gives me the closest trim possible without shaving which is great for my sensitive skin. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have had a couple others and found this to be the best tool for fresh shape-ups and beard trimming.  Buy it and don&#x27;t look back.</li>
    <li> This outliner is the best. I cut my own hair and use this to outline my forehead, neck, beard and mustache. It is sharp. Now to really get a closer cut with this machine I did tons of research from barbers. Add the \\&quot;Promate Trimmer Blade for the Andis T-Outliner\\&quot; to the machine for a closer cut. Its a thinner metal blade than the stock one it comes with. It cost about $15 on amazon. Man, since I added the blade its been heaven. The machine cuts razor close and precise. You get a professional cut everytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only tip for this machine, it gets hot quick. I recommend that you plug it in only when you use it. Unplug when not in use. Another thing buy a product called \\&quot;Cool Care\\&quot; its a spray that goes on the blade. From experience i recomend the first tip best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, well worth the money!</li>
    <li> If you think you&#x27;re spending a lot of money on these clippers, just one use will show just how valuable they are. I&#x27;m a man of value, so I like to get decent quality products at a decent price. Comparing these professional quality clippers to the Wal-Mart brand Andis clippers is like comparing safety scissors to a samurai sword.    I was even skeptical because when I compared the professional clippers with my old Wal-Mart brand, they looked similar.     Anyway, I used these clippers to shave off my beard and shape up my goatee, and they work amazing. Your hairline/neckline/whatever-line-you-use it on will end up looking sharp!    I recommend.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this product I thought it was going to be a closer cut but all in all it was worth it. Unfortunately my 8 month old pulled it down from sink and broke the tip of it now I got to buy some more</li>
    <li> Had to return it to Andis. Does not work. Waiting for Andis to either repair or replace it</li>
    <li> These liners are sharp and quiet. They give a clean sharp edge up and the new large on/off switch is great. Two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> My husband has been wanting to have one of these for a long time and I was tired of him constantly borrowing it from his father so I decided to buy him one around fathers day. It arrived. He opened it. Used it. BUT IT WAS DULL!!!!!!!!!! THE BLADE WAS NOT SHARP SO IT DIDNT CUT EFFECTIVELY!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Nothing compares, i&#x27;m African American and finding quality trimmers are very difficult, however, problem solved, these are the BEST TRIMMERS ON THE MARKET AND THE QUALITY IS UNMATCHED!  You can cut extremely close and it doesn&#x27;t leave bumps!!!!!</li>
    <li> Everything was ok. :)</li>
    <li> I love them. Just what I asked for. I will tell any and everyone to by them. I brought them for everyday use &amp; they are the best.</li>
    <li> I got this for 2 reasons. My current buzzer I use on my head doesn&#x27;t get my hair short enough and I also hate shaving and I like the 1-2 day old shave look. This does both GREAT.  I do use a oil after every use due to other reviews saying they had problems but I have used this over 50 times and not a problem yet.  Also another review mentioned cutting their ear it was so sharp, I have not had any problems with that.</li>
    <li> PERFECT!! This was JUST what I needed! No complaints!</li>
    <li> BOUGHT THIS FOR MY HUSBAND AND HE LOVES IT.</li>
    <li> Always wanted one. Had it now for over a year and it really is a solid trimmer. Haven&#x27;t had any issues with it...well it has a tendency to over heat but that&#x27;s after 30 or so minutes of straight use. No biggie really.</li>
    <li> It works great. Trimmer gets really close in sensitive areas. Didn&#x27;t get any cuts or pulling when touching the skin. I was surprised how much it vibrates tho but still very usable. Tried to use it on my dog but wasn&#x27;t really strong enough to do that but pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t intended to do thick dog hair.</li>
    <li> Finally a trimmer that cuts my hair instead of pulling it out. I have pretty thick hair on my face and every trimmer I have ever owned struggled to cut it and would often painfully grab and pull the hair. The Andis cuts through it with no problem and regardless of the length, my trimming is now fast and pain free.</li>
    <li> These are nice and good quality, but do not cut as short as the ones my barber uses. Just a little disappointed.</li>
    <li> Gives me the cuts I love. Well built product.</li>
    <li> Amazing trimmer. Would recommend it to any male with a maintained beard.</li>
    <li> great product i enjoy it. good product for ethnic male. great for goat-tee trim. feels like a true shave for ethnic males</li>
    <li> This product is as staple a product to the barbering and cosmetology industry as cheese is to dairy. This tool is the classic tool that barbers have been using for decades. A legend in the barbering industry, this can tool can last you a very very long time if maintained and cleaned. The blade will need to be replaced (as with all trimmers) but like most Andis products, this tool is built to last.</li>
    <li> Clipper arrived and immediately within 30 seconds of use the unit started making a horrible noise and the shut off lever would not shut off the unit. We had to unplug the cord to shut it down. The clipper also came without the usual plastic wrapper around the clipper which leads me to believe they are selling seconds or repaired units.</li>
    <li> This item came in good condition. Works like a charm. It has allowed me to give the best shape ups possible. Greatest investment a barber can make.</li>
    <li> Too early to give a true review. So far it seems to work fine, it&#x27;s the cord that will meet my expect ions if it last for a long time. Thanks, JAG</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews often, but I must say I&#x27;m glad I bought this. It trims my mustache and neck hair perfectly. Outlines around my ears like a pro hairstylist! Great for use between haircuts. It&#x27;s got a nice fine blade that doesn&#x27;t cut me when touch my ears and face while trimming. I debated a long time before buying this, (and I read the bad reviews and good reviews and leaned heavily on the bad reviews because I find them to be more accurate most of the time) and I can say it is now become a staple in my bathroom. Love it! Don&#x27;t have any overheating like some have mentioned, but then again I only use it for a minute or 2 and then back in the drawer it goes.</li>
    <li> The arrived in 4 days! They cut very well if you adjust them correctly. The trimmers do get hot after maybe 35 minutes of use. I only trim my hair so I take breaks to prevent them getting too hot or burned and it works. So you can either speed up the process or take breaks to let them cool off! Now my haircut looks like I go to the barbershop!!!</li>
    <li> You can adjust them to make them sharper and they last very long.  I had my last pair for over 4 years, before I dropped them and cracked the frame.  These are excellent trimmers, liners and tapers.  You won&#x27;t find a better pair for the price, and it&#x27;s hard to find a better pair at all.  You might be able to easily find a more expensive pair, but not better.</li>
    <li> Stop working after one use and you can&#x27;t even return it... DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Recommend for anyone who like to edge their own hair. Also all Thais military males, great use when you need to make a close shave.</li>
    <li> amazing fast shipping, earlier then expected, great product as well!t, easy and simple, makes it easier to shave and i can imagine another day shaving without this to line everythin up!!</li>
    <li> Trims quite close.... However, there is no carrying case provided and the metal edges of the unit is quite weak. I put the trimmer in my toiletry bag one and carried it on a flight with my backpack. No major drops and only soft cloth in the backpack. When I arrived at my destination and started shaving, I cut my face up pretty good. The edges of the trimmer are not durable at all and both had broken off.</li>
    <li> Good for shaping up and lining, BUT after a couple of uses (50 or more clients) the blades start to get slightly dull. But definitely a quality product</li>
    <li> i gave this review because the item was quality and there is not dislike only like and it work as expected. loving my Andis T-outliner</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t  know why, but the motors have died on me twice. I turn it on, small buzz. I turn it off and turn it back on, same thing. I have to do this like 20 times for it to finally kick over. It happened once and I decided to buy another one because I like it. A few months later, same thing again. I&#x27;m done with Andis products.</li>
    <li> Sometimes i think these reviews are automated or an employee sits here and types them all day - this product comes with a good rating which influenced my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However -&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been happily using Andis Trimmers for many years now.  Mine finally gave out so I brought this as a replacement.  It is just ok - doesnt shave as close as my old one did.  It also got smaller but the price more than doubled - go figure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the hunt for a better trimmer - if anyone knows of one, lmk!</li>
    <li> I bought them year ago and they been excellent ever since. And the built is professional grade. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this Trimmer for about 5 or 6 months now, and I am pretty satisfied with Andis&#x27; quality....however, after about twenty minutes, the trimmer&#x27;s heat becomes unbearable.  May require you to pause while cutting your hair, but otherwise...a very quality product.</li>
    <li> When I opened it the head was askew. When I snapped it back to a stable position, a piece of what seemed to be the head fell off. I ran it and it worked passably well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am hesitant to use it.</li>
    <li> This trimmer worked straight out of the box. I bought it for my cousin because she fades me up every three weeks and she loved it. It&#x27;s sharp and you get that close cut shave that you can&#x27;t get from the buzzer. This is great for general fading and detailed trim work that requires delicate handling. This is a must have hands down if you cut hair or if you have someone that cuts your hair buy it for them.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer, super close cut. I buzz my head monthly and these trimmers do a good job of bringing it right down to stubble. No issues with blade alignment or sharpness.</li>
    <li> This is a great Trimmer for those who cannot use razors. These trimmers will not break your face out with bumps. I would sugest that if this is your first trimmer to make sure it is set properly, I had my regular barber set the blades for a closer cut.</li>
    <li> These clippers are the bomb!!!  They cut sharp.  just like the barber shop.  I cut and shaped up everyone in the house.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money on this product.  the clippers are not nearly sharp enough to get the defined lines (outlines, line-ups, etc.) that you would want.  I can&#x27;t even imagine using this product to fade my hair as the blades seem so dull.  i definitely have to get them sharpened.  save your money and skip this product.  from someone who loves detailed outlines, line-ups, fades, etc. i am telling you that this product is not good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product on my very sensitive face, waited three days to see if any bumps were to appear. And the results were satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Time shouldn&#x27;t be wasted on issues that science has already found a solution to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a cosmetologist who works essentially as a barber. The state of California will not allow me to use a razor. For years I used this ( actually several ). I&#x27;ve never had on wear out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I drop them and break them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For any man who get&#x27;s bumps shaving this clipper will be a life saver er face saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I no longer use one professionally as I now Use Andis T-Edjer II for all my professional work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way if you still have bumps try this.  Get a soft tooth brush, boil it in water to make it even softer. Now brush your face with it by going around in a figure eight pattern. By By Bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually I&#x27;d give this clipper 4.5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Errol M. Gibbs&lt;br /&gt;Santa Rosa, California</li>
    <li> It is very, very rare that a product is as good as it&#x27;s says.  I have been looking for a trimmer for shaving my head for ever and this stuff is absolutely brilliant.</li>
    <li> Bought this to shave my head on a weekly basis. It cuts well and quiet and extremely close. However, the T-blade head is not the most comfortable thing raking across my scalp. I like the trimmer, but don&#x27;t think that I&#x27;d buy the same ones for the same application.</li>
    <li> We bought this after we realized our Wahl wouldn&#x27;t give a clean line at my son&#x27;s sideburn area.  It gives a very clean cut, almost like a shave.  This really saves us money because we can get away with less frequent haircuts for my son and husband without having them look raggedy.</li>
    <li> Worked well for the first couple times then the switch went out and it will not work.</li>
    <li> I really like these trimmers, they were packaged really well and shipped fairly quick. They were light and the blades cut very close to skin. They take much longer to begin to get too hot for touch which is great. Easy to keep clean and the cord helps with any tangled cord situations you may have. They cut really well and I do recommend this item to anyone.</li>
    <li> It was recommended by my barber, Its precision and capability to trim thick beard is the main reason i gave it 5/5.</li>
    <li> After speeking to an actual person on Andis customer service line, this product was recomended for me. You see i&#x27;m completely bald on the top my head with full thick hair all around my head, and i like to shave all my hair off to match my bald spot. Razors gives me bumps all over and ingrown hair with all the pain it comes with.&lt;br /&gt;First of all the package came in earlier than i expected, which is awsome, and after my first shave i can say honestly say IT WAS THE BEST CLEAN CUT SHAVE I HAVE EVER HAD. It&#x27;s been a week now and i don&#x27;t have any bumps or ingrown hair. It&#x27;s like razor shave without the bumps (no kidding). It took me 20mins to completely shave all the hair on my head and beard, and this is only because it was the first day with this product, i might be able to do it in less time as I get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing i did not like about this product was that after turning it on for 20mins nonstop it became hot, but still working. I&#x27;m not bothered by this at all.&lt;br /&gt;Overall i&#x27;ll give this product 5 out 5 and i wil recomend it for all my bald brothers with razor bump issues out there.</li>
    <li> This product works perfect for me. I use it to shave my face. I am the type that when I use a razor to shave I am left with bumps and breakouts. With the Andis T-Outliner Trimmer, I am able to get a close shave without all of the negative returns that comes with using a razor. Just make sure you keep it oiled and this product will last you a very long time.</li>
    <li> When I received it and opened it. It look the the blades werent put right and they weren&#x27;t straight either, I thought it was going to cut better but I wouldnt recomend this for like design or line ups. All though it cuts pretty bald but I would rather use the 50 $ to buy the Wahl hero you save like 10 $ and you would be more satisfied!</li>
    <li> I used this product to edge up me and my son&#x27;s hair, it works beautifully!! Nice clean line up very professional looking. I definitely recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Good quality brand edgers, I like!</li>
    <li> These clipper are Barber Standards...They will work if your work them.&lt;br /&gt;Natural Solutions&lt;br /&gt;www.stopsickness.blogspot.com&lt;br /&gt;317-892-9311</li>
    <li> Cons: It has no variable settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: it has no variable settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is a solid, no frills, dependable piece of equipment. If you have hair, and expect to continue having hair that you need to cut or shape or trim in the future, ignore the silly junk at the drugstores and buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Costs more upfront. But lasts longer and will outperform other trimmers.</li>
    <li> It Was perfect! It arrived quickly and it works wonders. The price was also great most of the ones I&#x27;ve seen were over priced.</li>
    <li> So far, it&#x27;s working as expected without any issues. I use it about three times each week and I have not had any problems.</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive to razor bumps so these clippers makes it easy to get a close shave daily without worrying about razor bumps appearing</li>
    <li> Good quality, it works great</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waist your money and your time buying this. It&#x27;s no good!! This is fake! I bought this a couple weeks ago when I got it, only one side worked or sharped and the power switch do not work well! So Don&#x27;t waist your money here!!!</li>
    <li> The outline I get with these is better than any trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used! My outlines have never been more clean! They are super durable too!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied I rate them on a scale of 1to 10 I&#x27;ll give them a 10 u can&#x27;t go wrong with these andis</li>
    <li> These are great if you don&#x27;t like using a razor!</li>
    <li> Very functional, it is quite powerful and very American quality. I bought another, but do not have the power to possess this, the truth that was well satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best edger on the market and its been this way for a long long time.  I have been using this for years and its still going strong.  The trmmer blade is nice and long so you dont have to make multiple cuts and you can easily adjust the sharpness of how close you want it.  If you are going buy an edger to use you need to make sure this is the one.  I have been cutting hair for about 17 years and i use this on myself as well as others.</li>
    <li> I cannot comment on the life of these clippers as I have just purchased my set not a week ago. UPDATE: Purchased 01/2006 and still going strong 06/2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can, however, comment on the quality of the cut. I have extremely sensitive skin and have had to endure the shadow look on my face for a few years as I have left the razor behind and moved to beard and mustache trimmers, but none of them have been able to get as close to a razor as the Andis T-Outliner has. I use it on my head and face and people have begun to doubt my sensitive skin excuse as the quality of the cut looks to be of razor quality. I also dont have to worry about the bumps that would normally appear when a cut is this close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already purchased another set of these as they were on sale as well as some machine oil. NEVER FORGET TO OIL YOUR CLIPPERS. The fate of my beard and mustache trimmers was grim because I didnt oil them as regularly as I should have. I am glad for it now, but imagine how much longer than 4yrs they would have lasted if I had taken proper care of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It&#x27;s been 5 years now and I still own this same set of clippers. Once, they stopped working, but it turned out that the screw on the side had changed positions and needed readjustment. After that, everything was fine. I did go through a bunch of clipper heads in the beginning, until I learned how to properly clean and care for them. The clipper head I have now is over 2yrs old and just as sharp as the day I purchased it. As for that second set I got (my &#x27;just in case&#x27; set), I keep it in my shave bag for when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, you wont regret this purchase. In fact, you&#x27;ll only do yourself a disservice by not getting them.</li>
    <li> They worked great at first then they broke a week later. So i got a refund. I&#x27;ve decided to just buy them locally. I will get the exact same kind.</li>
    <li> I use this for dry shaving and it&#x27;s very nice. I don&#x27;t need any shaving products for my skin, but sometimes my neck gets a little red and irritated after. That&#x27;s not fault of the shaver, but the blades are certainly sharp and consistent, and it gives you a very close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thick facial hair this would be perfect as a pre-shave before you lather and shave with a razor. I don&#x27;t need to shave with a razor after, as the stubble it leaves behind is so short you can hardly see it. If your wife likes a smooth face, this will get your 95% of the way there. Very highly recommended, and the quality of this thing is superb.</li>
    <li> A very great product! I modified the blades to give a better close cut, but they still work great without the modification. It&#x27;s a must! A con about this product is that it gets hot in about 4-5 min of use, but I use to for shape-ups and designs. I suggest people to purchase two of these Andis T-Outliners if you they have clientel.</li>
    <li> I AM SO DISSAPOINTED . My Outliners after 4 days are already breaking . When you turn it on its shakes morehan vibrates ! If anyone has any help on why this is happening please respond!</li>
    <li> the T-outliner comes as described in original packaging. Works perfectly, pretty quiet but does get pretty hot after prolonged use. Really quick shipping also.</li>
    <li> This trimmers were as dull as the all in 1 andis clipper set I bought from wal-mart. The blase is the same as well. I wanted a trimmer for sharp line-ups like the barbes and I didn&#x27;t get that. UNLESS, I&#x27;m missing something, these are not that sharp.</li>
    <li> I would prefer the wahls trimmer!</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver you can get, period. Just buy this. You will need to get some clipper oil but any barber you are even moderately friendly with will be happy to help you get it working. This is basically the best electric razor I have ever used. The blade is sharp, it fades really well, and it is low maintenance. You do want to figure out how tight the screws should be but this is the exact razor your barber uses. Buy this product. For the money, you will never get a product anywhere. It is super close cutting and on parts of my chin, I can feel no hair going against the grain, and in some very hard to reach places, light stubble. I cannot fathom people paying 250$ for a Brauun when you can spend around 50$ for this beautiful shaver. Best part is, you never ever have to worry about batteries and cleaning it is really simple. Again, you need to use clipper oil with it. It is really cheap and a small bottle lasts months with everyday use.</li>
    <li> amazing product, i use to shave almost daily, and sometime to trim my body hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;everyone should have one&lt;br /&gt;thumbs up</li>
    <li> K...hate to exaggerate how satisfied I am with this thing...gonna do it anyway. Just finished using it and man...it&#x27;s like dial up vs. DSL...there&#x27;s no going back. Basically I have no clue how I&#x27;ve even bothered trying to trim my face before (it has always been a chore). This thing just works!! The level of detail you can pull off with this thing is amazing!! If your even slightly considering getting this thing just do it. Totally worth the $$$ ALL DAY!</li>
    <li> Its quite good, I just wish it was even closer to a complete shave.</li>
    <li> Andis always delivers a great product. Had no issues with the trimmer (blade or motor) and good to know there&#x27;s replaceable parts for the product. Good experience with this Andis trimmer.</li>
    <li> I would not buy in Europe as the converter costs the same as the actual machine..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STICK WITH wahl FOR IRELEAND &amp; uk</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer to be a multipurpose cutter for beards and haircuts.  When I received it, I was surprised to find that it didn&#x27;t come with any attachements.  As such, I bought ASIN B000172RAI, thinking that the attachments would work with this trimmer; they don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish that the product page a bit more explanation about what the trimmer includes.</li>
    <li> just got the trimmer today, i like the fading capability for my own personal use but on other heads it is a pain because there is no guard. One major factor I did not like was that after 5 minutes of use the buzzer gets extremely hot at one point i had to literally get a napkin to hold the buzze in my hand and had to be very careful not to touch the metal to my head. They definitley need to fix this. I would not return this just because the fading capability for personal use was very good and the fact i would have to go through all the balogni of returning it. But I would not buy again, I am in search of still a all around buzzer for fading and line ups. This Andis overal was so so, it is not good for sharp lines but good for personal fading. Not recomended if your going to use on someone else other then yourself.</li>
    <li> I bought this Andis T Outliner in May 2015 on the recommendation of my barber here in Jamaica and positive customer&#x27;s reviews on Amazon. For the first two months it worked almost perfectly except for the noise. But today August 9, 2015 I was shaving and all of a sudden it stop working. I had to use a old shaver to finish shaving. My investigation revealed that the small metal that connect to the inside blade is broken which suggest poor workmanship and inferior material. Had I not been in Jamaica I would have returned it immediately. Extremely Dissapointed</li>
    <li> Works great. Adjusted the blade a bit to get the closest cut. Great service and great product!</li>
    <li> Love them&lt;br /&gt;More then what I expected,they give you a real clean cut&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to a friend for sure</li>
    <li> Hello all,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a loyal user of Andi&#x27;s trimmers. As a Black male, I have very curly hair that tends to grow inside and nothing other than these types of trimmers provide some relieve to keeping a clean face. The unit is great cutting hair. Nonetheless, the unit has a funny smell that none of my previously owned Andis trimmers have had. I wonder whether any other use has had any issues of these kind.</li>
    <li> the blade has to be adjusted closer to cut sharp ,its very loud ,has to be silenced with made a piece of sponge or rubber,the screws to open the machine gets round if not handled carefully , and after 9 months it starts to produce electric shock for some reason which makes it unusable</li>
    <li> My girl friend bought the Andis T-Outliner Trimmer with T-Blade,Gray (04710) for my birthday that I wanted from Amazon.The Trimmers cuts great easy to handle and they give a close shave and they are sharp and the price was good, I Love these Trimmers. [[ASIN:B000143C0K Andis T-Outliner Trimmer with T-Blade, Gray (04710)]]</li>
    <li> Waited for about 7 days. When it came didn&#x27;t use at first. When I did they came pretty sharp thought if have to gap them like the anis styler II.  But didn&#x27;t stylers are great as well</li>
    <li> Great price for a well built trimmer.  I stopped going to the barbershop years ago and settled on cutting my own hair.  This makes it a lot easier!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a tool known across the world for being one of the best liners and that&#x27;s what it does. You looking for that crisp look, use these and you got it! Love them they have gotten me a nice look when I have professional things come up out of nowhere.</li>
    <li> I have a bit of a skin problem on my face - it&#x27;s really, really sensitive and I can&#x27;t use a razor all the time or I break out. I have had one of these things for 5 plus years and it is a life and time saver. It cuts close (but not too close) and is longlasting. I love mine.</li>
    <li> As described. Brand new</li>
    <li> Had high hopes once I received my package and everything looked great. However, once I felt the blade tip, it seemed as if it was used prior due to oily blade. I brushed that off. I then plugged it to use and less than 1 minute, it shut off and did not want to go back on.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work had to take it to get fixed.  Would never buy this brand again</li>
    <li> Great service and great product. Awesome</li>
    <li> Gets a little warm but not so hot you can&#x27;t stand it.</li>
    <li> As I said in a previous review of a different trimmer by this company....this product Is pro grade.  If you&#x27;re a novice it&#x27;s not gonna make you a barber .  Product is excellent quality.</li>
    <li> Lasted 4 months, I figured got a lemon, so I ordered a second one; lasted 1 year, died on me 10pm with half of my head shaved!!!! I truly give it 0 stars!!!!</li>
    <li> I received a defective trimmer, the switch does not work. Once its plugged in the motor starts running and to stop it from running i have to unplug it. I am very disappointed. Its doing this straight out of the box. This is the second Andis product i&#x27;ve purchased and something is wrong with it.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband and he really loves it.  It gets the job done very well.</li>
    <li> Not sure how many stars to give because this was a gift and the recipient gave me no feedback.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never seen a guy happier about a shaver! Hubby loves his &amp; uses it all the time! He&#x27;ll never go back to the other shavers, they pull your hair &amp; &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; ya as my husband would say. He&#x27;s a happy happy guy!</li>
    <li> First the quality is first rate. My wife is a hair stylist and barber and recommended I use this trimmer for my facial hair. It is outstanding. As an african american male this is the best thing to use. I cant say that i ever had major problems with razor burns or bumps but i do have sensitive skin. After a week of using the trimmer what little blemishes I did have using razors cleared up. after a month of use I again have the face of a preteen! I am also a member of the military and it gives a close enough shave to past any inspection. Also works great for trimming/styling goatees and beards.</li>
    <li> These are a staple in every barber shop. Dry shave. Bald head. Everything. These are the best. Hands down. Andis!</li>
    <li> amazing its all you would expect nothing crazy beside it shipped pretty fast which is good !</li>
    <li> Perfectly what i was looking for.</li>
    <li> These clippers were used only one time before they broke. Now they won&#x27;t even turn on!! I am very disappointed...</li>
    <li> i should probably give these five stars, but after having adjusted these up short of even, I can imagine the blade mechanism perhaps being engineered a bit better.  I only have limited other buzzers to compare to.  still, they have good blades, a nice cord, great power for little buzzers.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with these really.</li>
    <li> Best Trimmers on the market!!!!! HANDS DOWN!</li>
    <li> Always just used a standard Wahl to cut my hair.  This Outliner is very very nice for a close cut.  If you plan on doing any lining up I would recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Powerful enough to cut though thick hair and precise enough to get those crispy line ups. This is a must have. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t get too hot. Light weight.</li>
    <li> This is a must have item for all of you DIYs! I bought this product for my boyfriend who cuts his own hair, and lines his own facial hair. He&#x27;s very pleased with the product. Once he&#x27;s done cutting and lining his hair, he definitely has the professional barber look. I&#x27;ve lined our son&#x27;s hair with them, and I think they&#x27;re a bit strong on the vibration, but I really wouldn&#x27;t know what to except.........Great buy!</li>
    <li> This is a very powerful trimmer!!!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this trimmer if you are tired of getting bumps after using razors.</li>
    <li> I tried many trimmers in the past, nothing nothing compares to this one. very strong motor. the closest shave to a razor. I use for beard and mustache, also limning&lt;br /&gt;i will recommend to friends and family.</li>
    <li> great value. professional grade. great price. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a great t-trimmer. I asked my barber what trimmer he uses he said &amp;#34;andis t-trimmer&amp;#34;... now I can get an extra 2 weeks out of my haircuts. it pays for itself in just a few months. makes great trimmer for men that have sensitive skin on their face/neck as you can get a fairly close shave with out razor bumps and ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> These are better than Oster and Whal&#x27;s lil Peanut.  Closer shave and goes through hair like a hot knife through butter.  Best I have ever tried.  If your super tight on money the lil Peanut will do the job just fine, but if you want the best get this one:)</li>
    <li> Still one of the best outliners on the market. Plus they are so cheap, I just buy a new one every few years...however, it is not necessary and will last for ages. Especially if you switch out the razors every now and then.</li>
    <li> The razor is excellent no noise runs better than the one&#x27;s sold at the beauty Supply store. It&#x27;s also very sharp i can only say again excellent</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the way this machine operates. It very quiet. Better than the ones I have used in the past. I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> This is the best outliner in the market by far.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is a piece of junk. Fof the life of me i dong kno why all the ghetto barbers swear by this thing. Its cuts like crap, dont make shape lines, and god forbid the hair is wet. It will not work at all. Also, the blade gets stuck constantly.  Ive never used a machine that had to be oiled as muchex as this to free the blades</li>
    <li> Well I like this product except that why does the brand new one I just purchase has comes with very dull blade? That&#x27;s so irritating!!!</li>
    <li> This trimmer is amazing.  I suffer from sensitive skin around my neck and break out with red bumps after shaving with a regular razor so i was looking for something to try and found this.  Cuts super close, never leaves any redness, and at a price 30-40$ lower than the closest beauty store I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does heat up after 2-3mins continuous use, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it.</li>
    <li> It qas i was looking for. It has that professional cut. My wife can cut my hair with ease.  The outliner trim my beard very professinal.</li>
    <li> Great little toy. I use it for my facial shaving. I was having issues w/ ingrown hairs and I&#x27;ve had only two since (2 months).  It cuts moderately close, leaving stubble but i&#x27;m fine w/ that. the edge is a bit sharp - you&#x27;ve got to have a gentle hand when using it otherwise you can scratch yourself. But it&#x27;s a very satisfying shave and great for touching up sideburns and lines.</li>
    <li> I bought these to edge up my son&#x27;s hair and they did a good job. The only thing was the shipping took over a week to deliver, past the expected date.</li>
    <li> The best clippers  give me a good close shave, most clippers. Out the their or not made for blackmen Our face texture is different thank u amazon for a great price every &amp; quality clipper ladies luv me with this close shave</li>
    <li> It gets hot quick but it also cools off just as quickly. It was for me and the kids at home.</li>
    <li> Use it every week on a regular basis. I love my liners. Couldn&#x27;t make it through weeks without it a great buy.</li>
    <li> Ever wonder what the barber is using on your face and neck to give you that clean look? This is it, and it&#x27;s no joke!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband and he really loves it. If you are a black man who cuts your own hair, this is the product to get.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t forget the oil!! Works great. Does what it should. Clean lines. Caution: it is sharp.</li>
    <li> love my trimmer its give me tje the perfect linning, i love it make me feels like a professional barber, lines very great, am happy I bought it</li>
    <li> This trimmer works great. I use it to trim my neck and beard. works fast and doesn&#x27;t bog down like cheaper brands. I got tired of wasting so much money so decided on these and they are well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I always wanted one. Now I can keep myself trim can Clean as often as I like.. Good choice Thanks.</li>
    <li> No Good They Brand New And Don&#x27;t Cut Good At All Andis T-Outliner Sucks Never Buy Again Save Your money People.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer for lineups and shipping was fast</li>
    <li> nice trimmer. Had to raise the blade for a sharper edge,  but Im satisfied with the product</li>
    <li> Was a fantastic trimmer for shaving my head but after three uses it just died on me...</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this thing for almost five years and it still works fine. it is starting to show it&#x27;s age a little. feels duller but still trims without knicks. just clean and oil with every use and i&#x27;ve had zero problems. great trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update 11/3/2017&lt;br /&gt;it has been over 7 years. still works great.</li>
    <li> Great buy!  Works good</li>
    <li> Great trimmer for personal use.  Powerful and doesn&#x27;t over heat.  I swapped in the Pro-mate blade for the best &#x27;baldie&#x27; performance and the setup works very well.</li>
    <li> If you have had trouble shaving and getting bumps easily, this clipper is your solution. I don&#x27;t worry about cutting myself either, cos it is so easy to use and cuts cleanly. Its so easy to use, that i use it as a body trimmer as well, dumping my old body trimmer.</li>
    <li> one of the best items I bought in my life.....a must have ......gone are a five day beard in seconds....even does a military buzz with help or do it yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;says monthly on shaving cream and razors. The kind the barber has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but after a few months it broke..then used oil........ it back at a five star</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to believe the bad reviews but I was immediately disappointed after opening the box and finding the clipper blade to broken. A chunk of the blade&#x27;s corner was broken off. The piece was not in the box which leads me to believe that the clippers were broken at the factory and passed through inspection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the clippers nevertheless to see if I wanted a replacement. I found the blade to be very very dull. I am returning these for some Oesters, I&#x27;ve had many years of good use with my old Oesters.</li>
    <li> Unquestionably the best trimmer of its kind.  I bought a set of guards to go with it.  It is well made,cuts with extreme precision and made in the USA.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had to replace the head set once in two years and haven&#x27;t had any problems cutting.  I did figure out that you&#x27;ll want to keep these a bit more clean and well-oiled.</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product by mistake, I was looking for something to cut my hair, I was advised to buy Andis products, but this Andis T-Outliner Trimmer is good too, it does what I was looking for, I am happy about this product, and I recommend it, I will buy Andis to cut my hair soon.</li>
    <li> I have been an Amazon Prime member for a few years now and have had nothing but good things to say about my experience with purchases on Amazon. I have never taken the time to write a review for any other product purchased on amazon, until now. I purchased these trimmers in preparation for a deployment. After weeks of research to find the right product I settled on these Andis trimmers. These trimmers had high reviews both on Amazon as well as other sites, so I felt confident with my purchase. First cut was great, needed just slight tightening of screws but performed well overall.I was extremely satisfied with the closeness of cut as well as overall feel of quality and durability.Second cut, painful pulling. I spent hours reading through the manual and researching through YouTube and other tutorials to no avail. Left with a raw and painful area on my head, I decided to write this review. I hope others consider my experience before making their purchase. For $50+ these trimmers should have performed better than the cheap $20 trimmers I bought over 2 years ago. Extremely disappointed, save your money.</li>
    <li> Trimmers work great for shaving and trimming. Have to be careful when tightened the screw outside the cover. Previous ones have cracked.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. noisiest andis machine I ever owned. I want to believe I got a faulty one. the sad part is there is no knob to adjust the power.</li>
    <li> This is a great item for a great price. I have been very happy with it since I purchased it and I think you will be too.</li>
    <li> The machine makes a lot of noise, and I have nothing to recommend. It was a waste of money, and I regret buying it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s works good until about 8 months in. Product began to make a loud noise an pinch my husbands skin.</li>
    <li> My husband and I were searching for the best brand/type of &amp;#34;shape-up clippers&amp;#34; for him to groom his beard/mustache at home... Once received &amp; tested, my Husband really liked it! He said, &amp;#34;...it doesn&#x27;t even pull/tug on the longer strands of hair on my face and it gets really close to the skin; not quite as close as a razor would/could but, I&#x27;m very pleased!&amp;#34; The only thing I wish it would&#x27;ve came with was a small carrier or something, to store the clippers &amp; accessories in vs. keeping it in the box or looking for an alternative!?</li>
    <li> Great trimmer, gets the job done. Does get extremely hot after continously using it. All in all a great buy.</li>
    <li> Everything was as they said it would be and more...awesome product</li>
    <li> Great trimmer! Works great on my head! Haha!</li>
    <li> It works great and cuts close just like a professional razor. I like the way it gets it the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> This t outliner is the best outline machine i have owned so far really precise sharp no irritation really close shave real strong motor great for shape ups and children skin  i have no complains what so ever honestly</li>
    <li> I no longer have to use razors for a close shave! This trimmer is awesome! Keep it maintained and it will last!</li>
    <li> I have a chrome dome and I have used many different machines to shave it. This is the greatest, most effective and absolutely harmless machine you could ever get to shave your chrome dome and also shave your face with no pain, no blood and absolutely no problems whatsoever.  This machine is extremely gentle on your skin and will never, never, never, ever give you any pain or leave you bloody or irritated on any part of your skin. I use this machine on my beard all the time. There is a video on YouTube that shows you how to zero gap this machine for a very, very close shave. After you zero gap this great machine, it becomes almost as close as a razor shave. I would strongly and highly recommend anyone to purchase this machine.</li>
    <li> Came very quickly And I was please with the product really works great. I would recommend this product really works great.</li>
    <li> I use this almost everyday and it works great! after a year i replaced my blades and raised the blades where it could get closer and its better than before so i love it</li>
    <li> Completely noisy even with 110 transformer if any idea to adjust will be highly appreciated</li>
    <li> Awesome clippers. The first set had a problem right out of the box and wouldn&#x27;t cut, so they replaced them and I&#x27;ve been using them for years now to hack through my thick scruff and body trim. My only complaint would be on neck, if I&#x27;m not careful with the perfect angle, it will pull hair badly. Almost impossible for me to get through a shave without it happening at least once. But I guess it&#x27;s because of how think and how my hair grows + the precision of these clippers.</li>
    <li> I have only had this outliner trimmer for under 3months but so far so good. I like the way that it fits into your hand and I enjoy the control that you will have when you use it. I use these trimmers for personal use/shaving and it works like a charm. For guys who have issues/concerns with razor bumps or ingrown hairs, this trimmer would be an answer to your prayers. Personally, I would recommend this to a friend because it is quiet and effective. In fact my barber even uses these so that solidified this trimmer as a must have/go to tool. Go and get this, you will get the bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> These clippers are awesome! Barber shop quality.  Now I can stay fresh.</li>
    <li> Already had one and it fell and broke, so I was not surprised at how pleased I was with the function of this unit.  Will get warm but does not burn and it does not nick or scratch. With care it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I got a used product and not new one but when i called to return the product. the proportionality of customer service was very excellent and recommended amazon.com and what ever problem you have they really fix it and give 100% satisfaction. i&#x27;m not from the U.S.A i was just visiting my family and i bought the product while i was visiting and the way they took care of me was excellent i hope they delivery to Canada I would be ordering everyday.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I was told that Andis was the best for barber quality outliners and I was not disappointed. These are as close as your going to get to a fresh line-up without using an actual straight edge. These are NOT a straight edge so please don&#x27;t expect that. They are the best trimmers I have used pre-shaving line-ups though and this is my 4th try on some strong outliners. One word of advice though is get COOL-SPRAY for during AND OIL for after because they do get VERY hot if your using them for time consuming line-ups/designs. Vibration is kinda heavy but its not surprising considering how much power the blades have. I would still advise buying a &amp;#34;cut-throat&amp;#34; blade if you are tryin to get a baby-smooth cut but these are the best &amp;#34;prep&amp;#34; for it I&#x27;ve yet to find.  EDIT 5/10/16 Just felt the need to add that I purchased new blades (only second time , i usually replace all clippers every 2 years) and these are still running like the day I bought them. If you clean them every year inside/out, and properly lubricate them with a quality product, they WILL last. I have had them since 2009 and while i can&#x27;t speak on recent versions/models, i refuse to buy a new pair after 7 years. Just a word of advice as far as manufacturing though, be sure they are NEW because this product is almost  adecade old and alot will replace parts to resell. Simply can be checked by opening the blade port and checking for loose hair speckles. It is damn near impossible to remove every last hair from the chambers and if you see 1-2 you know it is not new.</li>
    <li> I love these trimmers! They were a recommendation by Steve Harvey. Previously I thought there was only two ways to get a shave down to the skin; a manual razor, which gives you bumps and such because it cuts below the skin. Or a professional cut by the barber. This gets you down clean, I guarantee it! Very good price for the quality of this product! It warms up just as I finish edging the one side of my face which is the only thing that keeps them from being perfect but that cannot be improved no matter what other product you get.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through several outliners/beard trimmers.  I still have a pair of Wahl trimmers that worked fine - I just cannot find new blades.  The 2 previous Wahl timmers I had burned out.  My Andis T-Outliners have been going strong for several years now.  Only 4 stars as the original blade is not as good as the Pro-Mate replacements that are available.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is everything I expected. It gets close enough for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that it gets really hot after a while.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband. He loves it &amp; uses it all  the time</li>
    <li> fortunate these work good and had since 2007 but the andis headliner does not it is garbage and they gave it a grave review  you would think its the perfect clipper</li>
    <li> Excellent device for shaving. I am unable to use a razor as i am prone to razor bumps, but this andis trimmer gives me the same close shave without the bump package. Very quiet and comfortable. Been using andis clippers for years and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> My son uses the trimmer to trim his entire head twice each day.  Takes about 20 minutes each time.  Gets warm , but not hot.  Trims close, but not as close as a razor blade.  There is stuble.  Trimming neck - very close.  Trim edge of hair - neat and close - no stuble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A screw came out.  Customer support for Andis sent a replacement free of charge.  Son was tapping the blade agains the sink to clear hair.  Andis offered to replace blade set under warranty.  This is not normal wear and tear.  Now using brush and recommended oil.  Getting a good long life out of product and blade set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product.  Good customer support under warranty.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item for my wife and we ordered on March 6, 2014 and by May 4th, 2014 was not working at all.&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m trying to find out how to get this back to seller? or if Amazon will help us out? and I can&#x27;t find out where to go or who to call to get this item back or our money back as the item is not even 3 months old and won&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought stuff from amazon and never had issues with  but this time I  will have to deal with this issue and try to have a happy ending.</li>
    <li> This product does not work properly, the corner of the blade most of the time cut behind the ear. Almost every product that I had purchase in amazon is bad.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the slickest trimmer my husband has had, so easy to use and very well made, no quams about this one.</li>
    <li> These are the best clippers your going to get period.  I use these strictly for lining up my beard and shaving my neck and face.. very close cut, the next best thing to a mach 3 shave.. I seen these at my local barbershop and thought they were going to be pricey, $50?? Im going to be using these forever.</li>
    <li> I felt terrible after nicking my son with the normal clippers.  These are sharp, fast, safe and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Useful for beards and shaving. Plastic guides help if you use for beard. My skin is fine if I remove the plastic guards and use directly on my face for a smooth shave, then I give a quick polishing with a manual safety razor. The directions say to keep the blades lubricated with the proper oil so I purchased the Andis oil too.</li>
    <li> It is a bad product. It quickly overheats and after six months it stopped working. I bought it because I had very good reviews but I would not recommend it to anyone. Not worth spending a penny on this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not much to explain, these clippers are the best. I guess that&#x27;s why every barber owns on an average two or three, they may have others but I always see the T-outliners even when they are broken you will see the barber fixing them on their own. I will go further to say that on many occasions while at the barber shop, a barber will ask to use his co-workers  T outliner and he would answer those are broken. But they will be hanging up right beside the rest of them. So that&#x27;s how good they are even when they are not working they can still hang around the rest.</li>
    <li> they were dull when I got them</li>
    <li> Much like all my other shavers, not impressed at all. The attachments you buy separately don&#x27;t cut evenly or particularly well.&lt;br /&gt;The unit itself overheats and burns your hand and skin after about 10-15 minutes of use.&lt;br /&gt;Now, after a few months of using it, the blade seems to slip, it gets quieter, and it doesn&#x27;t cut.&lt;br /&gt;I should have sent it back months ago as soon as I realized how hot it got. Most of the time I&#x27;m not even done using it by the time it overheats.</li>
    <li> Worked great just as expected. Only thing I have to say that&#x27;s not great is after a while it will start to get warm just like any clipper</li>
    <li> Great beard trimmer, my husband likes it a lot. Powerful and easy to use. Does its job.</li>
    <li> I bought this Andis trimmer probably about 10 years ago. If you&#x27;ve never used a T-blade before, buy this and get used to it. I&#x27;ve been through about 2 carbon steel blades in that time frame and looking to purchase another. This thing will last you forever. I use it about 4 times a week or every other day and it has never given me any issues. Your blades will need to be replaced long before you will need another device for dry shaving. Andis blades are very available, affordable, and durable. You will not regret purchasing this.</li>
    <li> Ive been a barber for oven 6 years and in my honest opinion this is the best outliner trimmer out there. I do think it gets someone annoying sometimes when it comes to changing the blades. They tend to be some what difficult to align, making them not cut correctly but with some patience and practice you&#x27;ll get them working like they&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my Daughter going through Beauty College. I went through Barber College over 40 years ago and Andis was top-of-the-line back then. They still are today.&lt;br /&gt;They work great for cleaning up around the ears and the back of the neck. Probably good also for facial hair trimming but I haven&#x27;t done that personally.&lt;br /&gt;Just remember a drop or two of oil a day or so and if you don&#x27;t drop these I&#x27;m sure they will last a long time.</li>
    <li> They work great, my kids line up look  like a professional  done it. I am very happy with the out come of my new trimmers.</li>
    <li> Used to love these &amp; they were my go to trimmers for men &amp; women. However they do not work well with fine or baby fine hair. They tend to &amp;#34;suck&amp;#34; and pull the hair into the blade. Even well oiled, brand new blades.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer.  I can not say enough about it and it doesn&#x27;t cut the skin nor irritate the hair folicales</li>
    <li> Love these clippers, small, they shave very close, quiet and feel like quality, just keep them clean, don&#x27;t twist the cord while you shave or when you pack up... Make sure to give her a good name, and she&#x27;ll treat you right 😉</li>
    <li> Nice to return money back quick, thanks but different product from the ads.</li>
    <li> Im a hairstylist and work at a salon. Used it for two days and fell in love with these they cut extremely good compared to my other trimmers, wich i had like 5 within one year lol, i tried bullet, whal sterling and other ones., and this one beats em all so far!</li>
    <li> I have to go over the same area 5-6 times for it to cut all the hair, and even then, doesn&#x27;t usually get it.</li>
    <li> Brother likes it works well straight lines good cut every time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting these clippers for a while. The price was great, delivery was great and the cut that I get from them are great.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works really well and it super easy to use. It is heavy duty and works well for me when I am in between haircuts. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a trimmer. Easy to clean too!</li>
    <li> If you like to look your best as often as possible and don&#x27;t want to see a barber daily, use this every few days.  I&#x27;ve had this nearly 4 years and the blade is just as sharp as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who is this for?  This is ideal if you already have a basic hair trimmer set with different guards and you want something for that final sharp edge touchup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does this do?  This cuts far closer than the no guard on your basic hair trimmer so this can put lines on your head that you never thought possible - and some red ones too if you aren&#x27;t careful lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why use this instead of hair trimmer?  The way this blade is designed, it can create that sharp line around ears, temples, and back of neck.  It cuts nearly as close as a razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - excellent purchase if you already have a basic hair trimmer set and want something to be icing on the cake.  This will be your first and last T-liner you will ever need.</li>
    <li> Died without warning and I only used it a few times. One never knows what is under the hood, beware</li>
    <li> Item received worked and was same as item ordered.  Would not order the T-outliner next time, but I would get the edger.</li>
    <li> Hands down these are the clippers you need. You are waisting your money with inferior brands. This is where it&#x27;s at if you want a great sharp line up at home like the barbers do. Get the best. Andis.</li>
    <li> I know that these trimmers last FOREVER! My Dad has one, and has used it for well over 8 years, and it still worked like a charm. After leaving for college, I bought this one for myself and have been satisfied every time I use it. Definitely recommend these trimmers to anyone who asks.</li>
    <li> These are some great trimmers. They cut very precise and accurate. Sometimes if you cut for a long time it can get very hot and hard to hold but otherwise it is very easy to maintain and is a good product to buy.</li>
    <li> I like it. It is very sharp so don&#x27;t press too hard against your skin.  If I were purchasing again I would probably not get the &#x27;T&#x27; blade. Really don&#x27;t need it and could make cutting a bit awkward.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a good product although I&#x27;ve only used it once to cut loose hair. Concerned about ever using it to shave with it</li>
    <li> I like the way it shaves, had to buy another after a few years because the old one kept locking up on me.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, I had been using depilatory with the back of a butter-knife to remove the hair on my face. That was a time consuming process (about 18 minutes each time), and it would leave my skin tender for several hours afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so for using this. What are the benefits?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It cuts as close as any razor.&lt;br /&gt;2. You can shave with it dry.&lt;br /&gt;3. The shave lasts for almost as many days as with depilatory&lt;br /&gt;4. The amount of time that it takes to shave is less than half of what you would spend with a depilatory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:Highly recommended and worth every single penny.</li>
    <li> Works very well after adjustment of the blades. However I dropped mine on CARPET, and now they wont turn on. They worked really good while they lasted and I plan on buying some more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish they was more durable.</li>
    <li> problems with the 110v ac converting to 220v ac (NOICE)</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had the pleasure of trying my T-Outliner yet, but I am still pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Sharp, precise, quiet, easy to hold...what more can I say, these trimmers are great!</li>
    <li> Nice outliner gets super close and have not had issues with burns or bumps.</li>
    <li> Cuts well fresh out the box. The motor could be a little stronger but it is a great addition to my collection.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. Closest shave yet. 9/10</li>
    <li> Amazing clippers right here. You might have to adjust the razor to make it a bit sharper to get that perfect line-up (not a hard process)</li>
    <li> Lasted 2 months, then stopped working. doesnt turn on</li>
    <li> Best trimmer ever.  Be sure to buy some extra lube for it and a small brush to clean it.</li>
    <li> Not good at all. Made way too much noise the first time I put it on. Didn&#x27;t even bother try using it. Waste of money, waste of time</li>
    <li> This is great for line ups and trimmimg. Gives a super clean cut. Read the reviews says it gets hot in 20 mins, doesn&#x27;t really, maybe if it&#x27;s in constant run for 30 mins.</li>
    <li> This trimmer does everything it says it will do and more will cut what ever you touch would buy this trimmer again</li>
    <li> These are quality trimmers.  I use them to cut all my hair off and trim the outside of my mustache.  They do a great job.  Looks like a professional cut.</li>
    <li> Couldnt be happier with my purchase! Amazon was great they had my liners to me in the 3 days,  brand new in box. Havent got a chance to break em in yet, but I did get to use em on my last customer of the day and their working just as expected</li>
    <li> I had to have someone adjust it not so pleased</li>
    <li> great product,sharp crisp lines as review said. you just need to adjust the blade a little</li>
    <li> save me the trip to the barber every week for a shave!............I got my money&#x27;s worth!! and I can&#x27;t complain!</li>
    <li> I use this almost everyday work beautifully</li>
    <li> Great trimmer + outliner. Met all my expectations.</li>
    <li> I love these clippers i line my own faxcial hair and my hairline and these clippees are great...very close cut to make sharp edges or designs.</li>
    <li> The unit came in on time and it works great.</li>
    <li> I bought the clippers for my hubby and he loves them! He said they were very easy to use and precise.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly! New!</li>
    <li> I am a professional barber. I must warn you not to buy these trimmers. I had purchased them from my beauty supply house twice. Once thinking the first one was an accidental dud made by the company. However when I bought my second trimmer it was also a dud. Clearly Oster is no longer making them to the same standards.</li>
    <li> I bought these 2 years ago from Amazon. Same clippers still work perfectly. Just lubricate every few uses to maintain quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Bought again in 2016, just to have a fresh set. Still awesome. Still cut amazingly.</li>
    <li> Wow what can I say the reviews are correct on this one works well for outlines does what it should and met every expectation.</li>
    <li> This clipper just seems a little dull to me. My old clipper cuts closer. Wish it was a little sharper</li>
    <li> Very clean tight cut, vibrate a little bit though. Very heavy duty!</li>
    <li> Good quality good cut greatly recommend! 👍</li>
    <li> no other trimmer comes close. been using this model for the last ten years and so does my barber. they last for 10+ yrs if you use the cool care spray after every use</li>
    <li> This is the best, I shaved yesterday and so much compliments. I look like 20 years again. Its very simple to use, simple switch and the blade is easy on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no regrets buying this. I have been watching for a long time and finally i made the best decision in getting one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO more time spent by the barber shop, no more money to waste but instead i save that barber money and also i take small odd jobs from my nephews and cousins to give them a nice decent mark and shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect perfect perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a bit heavy but I just once I use more often I will not feel the weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much Andis. I believe in you...:)</li>
    <li> They work great, and feel very solid in my hand.</li>
    <li> Well cut, blades staying sharp, oil it up and good to go. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Great outliners. Andis didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> Works great for trimming. Heavy duty. Should last a very long time!</li>
    <li> I have four different clippers, and these are hands down the best.  The motor is quite, the unit stays cool.  The other clippers are loud and heavy.  For Balding these work very well .</li>
    <li> Needed a few adjustments out of the box but great trimmer for line ups, dry shaving and and pre-shave. Nice!</li>
    <li> Very good trimmer. Gives a very crispy shape-up. They get very hot, and there&#x27;s is nothing you can do about that but to just get faster at giving shape-ups.&lt;br /&gt;But overall it gets the job done.... to an extremely high level. Must have.</li>
    <li> Been cutting my own hear for 20+ years. This is hands down the best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned. Hope it lasts long.</li>
    <li> Just about everyone I know (father, brother, uncles, cousins, etc) owns an Andis trimmer. I can honestly see why they all use it now. I&#x27;ve used disposable razors for close dry shaving. Yes, they give a very close shave but there will often be times where irritation occurs. Irritation is an irrelevant case when it comes to Andis trimmers. No more razor bumps and certainly no more pain. If you find yourself shaving often, do yourself a favor and purchase an Andis trimmer. You will not be disappointed and you will save money in the long run.</li>
    <li> they were great quality and exactly what I need</li>
    <li> Provides a close shave. I can&#x27;t use a straight blade razor anymore because it gives me razor bumbs as do some other electric razors but this one is good. Others have complained of it being noise but it is very quite. My fiance can&#x27;t even hear it runniing when she is 20 feet away. My older recharable razor was much louder. This razor is also powerfull. It clips hair with little effort. You will need to adjust the blade to get a very close cut. Look on YouTube for a video to see how this is done. The blade does get hot with extended use (~20-40 min), but all razors do this.</li>
    <li> now I cane save those 10 bucks every week for a line up paid for itself in less than 2 months.</li>
    <li> I got this trmmer about 2 weeks ago. I started giving myself and my friends cuts, this trimmer is bad. It over heats when you use it for only 20 minutes you cannot even touch the blade because it is too hot. You have to wait about 30 minutes to cool it down. Also the trimmer cuts alot because of the heat the the adjustment of the blades. I would not recommend this. Go for the styliner 2 if your looking at mid range trimmers.</li>
    <li> Not sharp at all. This is useless. First of all, mine came in a box that looked used. Then I open the box and it was packaged like it&#x27;s been used before. The blades weren&#x27;t sharp at all. The body of the clipper even had weird looking cracks. I&#x27;m so disappointed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have a huge doubt that this was brand new. I&#x27;ve heard how sharp these Andis trimmers are but this one is horrible.</li>
    <li> These were awesome but I had them for 8 months and idk what happened..something is wrong with the motor or something. Hopefully my one year warranty will take care of the issue.</li>
    <li> Product came on time and fulfilled all expectations. I had never known why this product was so widely used until I got mine. It was everything I was looking for...</li>
    <li> oh man i love this so much idk why i haven&#x27;t bought this earlier. i oil it before and after. its perfect for shaving as well as shape ups!</li>
    <li> Great service. Item arrived as described. Works great.</li>
    <li> Great cutter. Just don&#x27;t drop it. Lol</li>
    <li> this is the real deal. i instantly tossed away all my other cheap trimmers. You will not be disappointed with this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second clipper. I never use a razor anymore, as this trims almost as close!</li>
    <li> Working on handling it, still. Cuts clean, but vibrates heavily. However, it is the most precision I&#x27;ve ever gotten with a trimmer.</li>
    <li> I was looking for more of a professional grade edgers. They work well but I have a store brand Andis that work just as good so either they made the store brand as good as the professional grade or the professional grade doesn&#x27;t work as well as expected. Plus the store brand shaves better without hair pulling. But I still think it&#x27;s an ok buy.</li>
    <li> Bought it in April it gave up in May. Not durable at all. It was personal use only, used it once or twice a week. Trying to find the seller.</li>
    <li> I liked these trimmers to start and was excited to finally own a set.  However, after ONLY 2.5 MONTHS, THE CLIPPERS STOPPED WORKING COMPLETELY. WTF!!! I&#x27;m pissed. If I had known that these clippers would have only lasted a few months, I would have spent my money on another product. Tried to look into a return policy which apparently doesn&#x27;t exist either beyond a month.  What a waste. Smh.</li>
    <li> The clippers are good.  They are not as good as the older model Andis trimmers that I purchased years ago.  No problem but I think I got a closer/better trim with the older ones.  I still recommend this product for its name brand recognition and quality of hardware.</li>
    <li> Very precise. Close cut. I use it to shave. Has only cut my skin a handful of times over many years of weekly use.</li>
    <li> Extremely hard to adjust the blades to get a sharp hair line trim.</li>
    <li> excelent quality, and very good service, thanks</li>
    <li> Very nice clippers. Very well made. My second purchase of this product, first one was 12 years ago. I&#x27;d say they work well.</li>
    <li> No it bid not do what I thought it would do. Was looking for everyday shaver.</li>
    <li> Very good. as I expected.</li>
    <li> I own 2 of these I&#x27;m a barber if you set the blades right or order some custom ones it really is close to a shaved edge. They do get hot after about 15 min of constant use and at about 20 they will get to hot to cut with that&#x27;s why I have 2 especially when I&#x27;m doing a design.</li>
    <li> This is a Update review after maintenance. Garbage! MADE IN USA! See pic&lt;br /&gt;Stopped working after 6 months.. screwed up. Contact customer service. They said they could mail a new screw! Don&#x27;t wanna say anything about it at all. See atteched photos.</li>
    <li> Just what i was looking for.quality trimmers at a reasonable price</li>
    <li> 3 words&lt;br /&gt;One of the best</li>
    <li> Quiet motor and easy to handle.</li>
    <li> Apart from it&#x27;s uncanny ability to skip just the gray hair, it does a good job on the head but not the beard.</li>
    <li> At max i used it 10 times since i bought this trimmer &amp; now it stopped working. waste of money.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer for beard. Need to take it apart and clean it out from time to time, but it is holding up better than other brands.</li>
    <li> Cuts real neat. Would be good to have a trim guard to adjust the height--or an adjustment arm to get it a mite higher.&lt;br /&gt;It gets hot after a while but not too bad and it cools down relatively quickly.</li>
    <li> I believe that for barbers choosing your clippers is mostly based on personal preference. However these clippers are the most commonly used clippers on the market, I don&#x27;t know too many barbers who don&#x27;t or have never used this clipper. I like it because it&#x27;s easy to adjust, very sharp, fast, close cutting clipper. Great for getting a sharp Steve Harvey hairline. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> ive had this item before and it works great, however this was my first time ordering it from amazon. when i received my package everything seemed normal, but when i plugged in the clippers i could tell right away that something was wrong. the clipper blades were moving way to fast and it sounded terribly loud. besides that one occassion ive actually owned these clippers twice before and those two times they were fantastic</li>
    <li> Bought it for my son as a Christmas gift!&lt;br /&gt;He loved it, it was exactly what he wanted &amp; needed!</li>
    <li> I bought this item and used it for 5 months and it was great, but then the motor just stopped. I would be cautious to make sure to buy this at a store with a great return policy!</li>
    <li> Has been serving me for months!  does a great job!  Very smooth shave without injuries at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very little maintenance overhead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product was recommended to me by a professional barber; after over two months of use, i would definitely recommend to others!</li>
    <li> Great for edge ups,  and cleaning up the neck area.  Can also cut hair,  but I would not do that,  because it is way too sharp.</li>
    <li> Great for detail and around the ears. Very happy I bought this and wish I bought it earlier. Worth the money!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband Valentine&#x27;s Gift he loves it this is a really great gift!!!! I highly recommend it was worth every penny!!!!!</li>
    <li> Nice tight shave with these. I use them to tame my BMS: Beastly Man Syndrome. I can do a full upper body shave front and back and no nicks. I had cuts and/or razor burn using the Balding clipper by Wahl so gave that to charity</li>
    <li> If I can give no stars I would!! My husband brought these and they are Hot in your hands and does not cut sharp! The price should have been 15$ because that&#x27;s how they cut! I&#x27;m sorry but I am returning this item! I will never buy from this seller EVER AGAIN!!!!</li>
    <li> So far so good. No problems to date.Good product as usual from Wahl.</li>
    <li> Wonderful trimmer! As a cosmetologist I cannot use a razor on the skin, so this is perfect for getting a reasonable shave or beard shape in without the use of a razor. Not too loud and cuts a clean line. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying these are good trimmers. I like the size of them and the strength of the motor. With that said there are some shortcomings namely the blade getting hot. It can be cooled down by using one of the clippercide sprays but that&#x27;s a bit of a hassle. Hot blade aside though I still say these are the best on the market.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned. Battery powered ones struggled, pulled, and couldn&#x27;t make it through my beard. This thing is a beast. Goes right throw effortlessly, no pulling, no need to go over the same spot a ton of times, it&#x27;s impressive.  Wish it came with attachments, but hey, my beard is short, it takes a fraction of time to get there, and can now throw what others can&#x27;t without pulling or cutting you. Could probably cut your shrubs outside with it, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> It Does get hot very quickly, and I use it to cut the hair of my dog, and it works great</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift and my boyfriend loves them. He cuts hair on the side and his &amp;#34;customers&amp;#34; have been raving about what a good job he does with these clippers. I mean, it&#x27;s mostly talent, but the quality of these clippers certainly plays a part. They are quite, run cool, and they produce some of the best line-ups I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
    <li> good quality product. i like the fact that i can shave that close with out a blade. great for balding dudes.</li>
    <li> great product, great price and the free shipping was a bonus.</li>
    <li> Cuts with crazy precision! Buy this and the Outliner II to switch between them as you cut. This gets hot so keep clipper oil handy to cool the blades during use.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have a thick, heavy, tough beard, and need to be clean shaven daily for work.  I have never been able to use a safety razor.....they don&#x27;t cut my facial hair worth a darn, not even a one day scruff, they tear my face up, leave nasty razor burn, irritated red bumps, and in-grown hairs.  Electric shavers have always provided similiar results, although not quite as bad as with razors.  For at least 20 years I have used the pop out beard trimmer part of numerous electric shavers every day to get a reasonably close &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; without all the irritation and aggravation of using the razor or the shaver.  My last shaver was starting to fall apart, so I decided to find something that is purpose built for how I use it, instead of the flimsy pop out trimmers that are on all of the electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so far completely satisfied with this trimmer.  It cuts every but as close to the skin as the pop out beard trimmers built in to any of the shavers that I have owned.  It cuts much close than any electric beard trimmer that I have ever owned.  The hairs are cut too short for me to measure.....the trimmer leaves behind a shadow that has a sandpaper feel.  There is no skin irritation after using this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, this thing is built well, and it is made in the USA.</li>
    <li> After reading so much good reviews I decided to purchase it.  When I turned it on I noticed that it was running slow. My outlet doesn&#x27;t have anything plugged in it so I don&#x27;t know why it would run slow.  I looked at the trimmer and I can&#x27;t find any adjustment screw to beef up the power like those found on the clippers.  I am not sure if I got a bad trimmer or not.</li>
    <li> This trimmer cuts really close but I wonder why it gets so hot. I usually trim my face and my body with my other trimmer but this one cuts to close and it&#x27;s to risky shaving your body with it.</li>
    <li> These trimmer are the best I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I use them for dry shaving because traditional razors irritate my skin.  Dry shaving with these trimmers is comfortable and produces a very close shave. Motor runs smooth and quiet. Only down side is after about 30 minutes of use the trimmer gets moderately warm.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a new Cosmetologist to the industry but I was suggested to use these trimmers-- I can say they are unlike any other trimmers. These trimmers cut and outline the hair so easily and gets virtually every hair. It&#x27;s great for bald fades too! I wish I got the black set of trimmers since it looks more professional but they work so well that I don&#x27;t even care. Overall, these are the set of trimmers I&#x27;ll always go back to! If you&#x27;re buying trimmers, buy the Andis T-Outliner!</li>
    <li> These are good clippers but they get stupid hot after short periods of use. They cut good and clean, you have to adjust as with most clippers but if you are a person taking your time to get clean proffesional hair cut at home then you will not like these. I mean these clippers get almost impossible to use hot. it isnt the blades that get hot but the body. I keep these clippers properly oiled and i take apart my clippers to clean hair from the inside. in no way changed the functionality only unscrewed the casing screws and blowed out the hair. Have had clippers various brands models needed a good liner and this does it well but dont take to long or youll get these hot. Way hotter than any other clipper used in same time span.</li>
    <li> Never fails!! Best trimmer for shape-ups and non-razor shaving. Only thing is that it heats up after 15min of continuous trimming or shaping. Get a freeze spray or another trimmer to avoid burning of the skin from hot blades.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift to my son and he really likes it</li>
    <li> I wanted a trimmer for Christmas because they work better than razors so my mom ordered me this one and I am glad she did....</li>
    <li> Great but hey they don&#x27;t make cheap stuff. I use it to shave with and I love it. saved me money from buying all that shaving crap!</li>
    <li> These liners are exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for in the many bad purchases of commercial brands that boast of many attachments and have not been durable products. They do get hot though, so be efficient in using them.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer! I bought it for my goatee and beard primarily. It is great for that and touching up your hairline.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was look to get.  Work great, but could use more blazes.  Would recommend this  product to others.</li>
    <li> The best i ever had and its easy to handle</li>
    <li> Andis T- Outliner Trimmer was exactly what I needed. Clippers very sharp blade that&#x27;s great for lining or shaving entire head. I been looking for these type of Clippers to shave my entire head, which has saved me a trip to barbershop.  To adjust your blade,  youtube have several easy examples.  My professional barber use these same exact clippers. They recommend that these Clippers are the best.</li>
    <li> great but totally stopped working after about 1 year</li>
    <li> This trimmer works great as a balding clipper. I would recomend them for anyone that chooses to shave thier head as close without worrying that it might cut your head. It shves close enough that if you are razor sensitive you need not use a razor at all.</li>
    <li> it does not feet the voltage and frequency of EUROPE countries</li>
    <li> I bought these because I previously had a problem dry shaving. I have tried everything from razors to electric shavers to the $20 trimmers Wal-Mart had available near christmas times. None of them come close! You will have a razor close dry shave without ingrown hairs or razor bumps! You feel like you are holding the rolls royce of trimmers while shaving with the low rumbling of this well built machine! Awesome couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product!</li>
    <li> Does what it says. Very precise lines. The only issue I had was that the blade does become hot after about 15 minutes of continuous use. You will probably never have this problem unless you are cutting a toddlers hair.</li>
    <li> very good for trimming and edging. When in a hurry I shave with it.</li>
    <li> This is a professional quality product at a very reasonable price.  And it&#x27;s made in the USA!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine going on a little over 10+ years and they&#x27;re still going strong. I keep blade clean and oiled, &amp; replace about once a year. If you&#x27;re looking for an edger you can not go wrong with these from Andis. ONE OF THE BEST IF NOT BEST!!!</li>
    <li> If you trim anything of your hair, get this.</li>
    <li> Great trimmers! Feels like the one I got was used once before.. But it&#x27;s okay, I love this trimmer! It makes cutting hair fun for me!</li>
    <li> Clipper are great for the price. Cut real sharp. I gave them five stars. Work like the pros at the barber shop.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE REALLY GOOD,I CUT MY OWN HAIR AND YOU NEED THIS TO FINISH YOUR HAIR CUT PROPERLY.THER ONLY FOR SHAVING ,OR DETAILING EDGING.NOT FOR FULL CLIPPER CUT.REALLY GOOD SHAVE TO.SHARP</li>
    <li> A must have tool for the barber!</li>
    <li> Died within a few uses.. couldn&#x27;t even contact seller because it was outside of the &amp;#34;return window&amp;#34;. Wasn&#x27;t used daily and stopped working less than two months after purchase. Really disappointed with being unable to return item as it seems to be dysfunctional.</li>
    <li> Love these. Always a perfect line.</li>
    <li> I bought this in December and just used it for the first time . The machine pulled my hair after i oiled it and went to give myself a haircut . Felt like it wanted to pull the brain out of my head . Sorry i din&#x27;t use it earlier as now i&#x27;m out 50$ .</li>
    <li> Still working good 2 years later!</li>
    <li> Once I got the blades lined up it cuts perfect. I love them. Best investment!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great trimmer. ..</li>
    <li> Have used trimmer from this company before with great success, but it was very clear from the outset that this product was a disappointment, unit would cut properly after a few minutes of being plugged in, but would get hot and stop cutting. poor design, stay away!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Trims smoothe and very easy to maintain. I receommend for all barbers. Blade is sharp but not too sharp</li>
    <li> Clippers are good. Pretty much knew what I was getting.  Only complaint is that the cord is not as thick as my previous and is clippers and the plug is only 2 pronged.  Hopefully wiring problems are not an issue</li>
    <li> excellent i give you 5 star</li>
    <li> I couldnt believe that a trimmer could trim the beard to such an extent that it almost looks like a shave with the comfort of being smooth and not scraping the skin like a razor does. This product has changed the way I look at a beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> Excellent clippers.  Does the job.</li>
    <li> This item was defective and does not work well.  The motor does not work well and the blade is also not good quality.  I have owned many Andis T-Outliner&#x27;s and they are my favorite outliner.  I have been a barber for almost 20 years and I know how to adjust my blade, That is not the issue.  Not sure if the item was an imitation or I just got a lemon, but I am not happy with my purchase at all.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Cheap and delivered broken</li>
    <li> cuts very nice.  great trimmer for the price.</li>
    <li> Not much to be said here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned these clipers for a year and a half and shave 1-2 times a week, and they still perform just as well as the day I got them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High quality would recommend to anyone who want to get away from dealing with expensive disposable razors and shaving bumps.</li>
    <li> Best clippers for getting that sharp crispy hairline if you know how to use them the right way</li>
    <li> They work really well! The only reason I gave 2 stars is because they unexpectedly stopped working one day when I was using them to cut my hair. They slowed down out of nowhere and have never turned on again. I might buy another one soon but I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
    <li> THESE are great for a bald head shave or facial shave. They are really lightweight and pretty quiet to be trimmers. I would say yes buy it.</li>
    <li> It works great! 10 times better than any cordless</li>
    <li> Not what i expected at all. Does not even line correctly, and is dull. I am not satisfied. I would send it back but I have already used it.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is one of the best I&#x27;ve used.Cuts very close and is great on the head and face. Anything closer would be balding clippers which can cut into the skin.</li>
    <li> This is my first review, LISTEN! These are the best trimmers I&#x27;ve owned. I have been good at giving myself a cut, but had some old cheap Andis home set and adjusted my clippers to be nice and sharp, so it did  both jobs pretty decent,  but after 4 years, I decided to skip replacing the blade again, and go for a trimmer and clipper combo. I got the speedmaster 2 and the t-outliner.&lt;br /&gt;The blade is sharp alone, and can be used for cutting beards lining up, and shaving to a 5 o clock shadow. I decided I was serious about getting a real shave like experience, so I bought the primate blades and it really makes sharp lines. I don&#x27;t get pull, and the motor I smooth and quiet. I promise this will do what I say.&lt;br /&gt;STOP BUYING TRIMMERS FROM WALMART, AND GET THE REAL DEAL!</li>
    <li> It get hot so quickly and not durable compare to pro-mate precisioner.</li>
    <li> Blade was scuffed when I received clipper.</li>
    <li> My husband ordered these so he (by he, I mean I) could cut his hair. They&#x27;re easy to use and clean. Amazon&#x27;s price was way better than Sally&#x27;s Beauty supply.</li>
    <li> This is a really solid piece of equipment. Just the weight of it and the hum of the motor screams quality. I use this to edge my haircuts at home and it is extreme precision. I also dry shave my neck with it so that I can avoid getting ingrown hairs. Right out of the box it cuts really close to the skin. Not quite like a razor, but better than anything else I have encountered. I also ordered the attachment combs (Andis Item #23575) to trim my beard and they are a perfect compliment to this already fantastic trimmer. You could spend $45 on a beard trimmer at target that will die in a year or have this operating for far longer while doing a drastically better job. Ive only had it for a day but so far I am impressed.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer, but the blade/razor is too wide.  My hairline is suited for trimmers with a smaller/narrower blade.  You should check the Wahl Detailer.</li>
    <li> Great product sent in a quick timely manner</li>
    <li> Great performances! Just work perfect for me!</li>
    <li> So sharp to get that crisp lineup like the barbershop. Now....all I need to do is master it. :-)</li>
    <li> Perfect for getting a close shave.  Much better than the standered electric razor.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Fast and accurate.</li>
    <li> Works Great. Delivered fast</li>
    <li> very satisfied with my purchase so far. i have been using it to give myself clean shaves and it works.  no more razor bumps as was the case before. i even use it to give myself a hair cut when i attach the comb ( i bought them separately).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only 17 and almost let the reviews discourage me, but I have no bad comments towards this. It comes with oil but the thing is hard to open because you have I punch a hole in it. I finally got it with a lead pencil I think. Also this things vibration is strong when u first get it but either it calm down or I got used to it.</li>
    <li> it is what I wanted and  it works just as well as my old one.. SOLID</li>
    <li> dosent do a good job of trimming the hairs on my face.</li>
    <li> I bought these just about 3 years ago (I think) but they&#x27;re still sharp, still cutting, still worth every dime. I use them just about every 2 weeks on my son &amp; I so they get plenty of usage &amp; all is still well.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, they are great for trimming my mustache and beard...</li>
    <li> Classic material right here! Simply the greatest dry shaver ever made. &#x27;Nuff said.</li>
    <li> He wasn&#x27;t that into it unfortunately.</li>
    <li> These clippers are great. They cut so close and without any pain or irritation. Normally clippers scrape my bf skin causing irritation and bumps. Without a doubt, i recommend this clippers and the brand ... buy it its worth it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s prefect for the job</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this trimmer for personal or professional use it is an awesome product&lt;br /&gt;I rate it 10 stars if I could</li>
    <li> very good product, fast order and excellent for the price. I loved it because it is just what I was looking for and they sell</li>
    <li> Great product very well built. To my stupidity I dropped it within two weeks use so I have to order another T blade as mine chipped. Nonetheless great product, blade came sharp.</li>
    <li> Super skin tight trimmer. I use this when I cut my own hair. Blade is sharp and trims real close almost like a shaver. I like the way it feels when trimming. I have thick hair but this thing cuts through it like butter! Cleans up neck line hair and the perimeter real nice. It&#x27;s not a real haircut if you don&#x27;t have this!</li>
    <li> Purchased 2 of these Outliners simply to give the other pair to my sister. No problems with the cutting but man I have about 8 heads I use to these with and they get so hot I have to wear a glove. Believe me I&#x27;m not exaggerating, close cut but really hot in about 15 mins of continuous use. I say its a good price cuz they are heavy duty but if you buy these purchase the cool care spray, it helps.</li>
    <li> See original review below. Before I sent the clippers back I took the blades off and put them back on without any adjustment, which I would not know how to make anyway.  The screws were on tight when I took the blades off and I don&#x27;t know how they could have become misaligned. Apparently they did, however, because when I tried the clippers again they worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars because I should not have to fool with the blades after three uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product as a replacement for a trimmer I had used to trim body hair. I wish I had kept my old one. Worked great twice. Now it pulls hair rather than trims them. Apparantly the blades become misaligned on their own. There is zero information on this product on the Andis website. The price is too great for a two-use trimmer.</li>
    <li> you rock...thanks alot pleasure doing business with you..:D I couln&#x27;t get my clippers any faster and they work great..I&#x27;m not a barber I just cut hair for fun as a hobby but clippers and trimmers like this one will make my learning expiriense way better...</li>
    <li> Gets the job done and holds me off from going to the barbershop so frequently ! Sharp and precise lining!</li>
    <li> I love this product, I hated looking for this product at the local Sally&#x27;s. They were a rip off,  I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
    <li> I love these trimmers. You can notice superior quality as soon as you click these on.</li>
    <li> Good clippers. Sharp and comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> My husband always feels that the other clipper we have &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; him. He swore that these would be different a and I wasn&#x27;t believing it. Yet, he was right. He always flinched before and now he said he feels nothing. He&#x27;s edge is much sharper to! Love them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never seen a hair clipper that didn&#x27;t come with the clip-on guides until this one arrived.  It also doesn&#x27;t seem to have a lever to adjust the cutting height.  to make things worse, it doesn&#x27;t even come with a case for storing it between uses.  All-in-all, I found it totally useless for cutting my hair, and I returned it.</li>
    <li> They give a good cut, but they hurt for one. Two, they&#x27;re corrode over time. They&#x27;re rusting and I&#x27;m scared I&#x27;m going to get lead poison. Also, keep your oil ready bc they do stick. They&#x27;ve lasted for about a year but oil is running out so it maybe time to buy some oil or new clippers.</li>
    <li> Its what I expected, a very well built product.</li>
    <li> Stopped working within the first week, after third use!  I was moving and kept putting off to return it and then 30 days passed so now I&#x27;m stuck with it.  I&#x27;ll try to use the warranty to get it fixed or replaced.  When it did work, it worked well although it is heavy and takes some getting used to when holding.</li>
    <li> A1 quality product. I use these to edge myself up and they work perfectly. You may have to adjust the blade out of the box like I did to get them sharp. I will say they do run hot after 15-20 mins of use. Overall the Andis T Outliners are great</li>
    <li> Head broke, replaced it but now it make a very loud buzzing noise and doesn&#x27;t cut right.</li>
    <li> These trimmers give a nice clean straight line!!!</li>
    <li> Great trimmer! I am definitely a fan of Andis!</li>
    <li> Shaves very close. I have thick facial hair and shaving won&#x27;t work for me since I get razor bumps. Easy to use and hold. It&#x27;s comfortable in my hands (I have big hands). Well balanced as well. I also use it to trim and shape my mustache.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is great.  I dry shave my face with it and I can get really close.  Well made, a little heavy but so what.</li>
    <li> The best things ever made.</li>
    <li> Always a great product no complaints thanks!</li>
    <li> nice, small and shaves very close and  clean. Only thing is that it is very loud when being used. not really an issue. I think this is the best trimmer for shaving.</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this product for me about two years ago and they are still as good as new. They can get as low as I need them to without being irritable. For the past two years, my co-workers have constantly been asking me what brand of clippers do I use. And I can proudly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Broke and within a month and company refused to replace it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this clipper over 40 years ago and it keeps on clicking like Timex.  I had to buy replacement blade set once, not because the blades were bad, but the fiber separator died and was not sold separately.  I oil the blades regularly; in fact I check for cutting action every time I use it and oil blades if necessary.</li>
    <li> I must admit these are realy good for shape ups. But when I recieved my outliner I notice there was a piece that was broken on my guard, so I cant use the full guard because it would hurt. But overall that! Pretty good for shape ups line up or even bald fadeing,i will be sending these back for a new one that has a full guard not a broken left side pieace of guard.</li>
    <li> The item still works to this day. It gets hot after 5 minutes of use, but stills performs a fine edge and cut. The price may have been too much considering the length of time the clipper can use continuously.</li>
    <li> Best one of all I&#x27;ve used so far.&lt;br /&gt;Above all made in USA.I love the fine quality.Don&#x27;t forget to oil it regularly.</li>
    <li> worked great when we first got it but lost its sharpness quickly. I expected more but it&#x27;ll do for now</li>
    <li> No complaint, excellent...</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer. I had the andis peanut and needed something that would give me a sharper outline. Im glad I got it. Very fast shipping. Received before expected. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Need coolant if your not fast</li>
    <li> Best outliner ever !!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, similar quality as barber&#x27;s use.</li>
    <li> The T-Outliner needs no introduction...most people I know have one or have had one. They last a good while it you take care of it. I use the andis clippers spray everytime I use it to keep it fresh and a duster to blow out any excess hair caught between the tight spots. Good product.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this is the official one...But it works fine to me!!! For some reason I thought these went lower.</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmers even right the box, get them zero gap even better</li>
    <li> Seems a little less powerful and pulls my beard more than my last one.  Same model number and shell but feels different.  Still better than any other brand or trimmer I have used so I still recommend it.</li>
    <li> Out of the box, already broken. I said it&#x27;s American brand i am buying quality product, but no luck</li>
    <li> very sharp, clean cut......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!</li>
    <li> Good product, fully met expectations.</li>
    <li> This out liner is one of the best.</li>
    <li> These SUCK! I&#x27;m really disappointed I thought these were going to be really sharp but they are not, I have to modify the blade to make it sharper, smh piece of sh*t edgers, get something else</li>
    <li> Cut the back of my neck just fine. Doesn&#x27;t get jammed up. Nice and soft against my skin didn&#x27;t cut me at all.</li>
    <li> This is a Professional trimmer for people who are saying its too noise they are just people who probably never used andis or don&#x27;t even know the name and for people who say its not for long use It is u just have to clean and adjust them and over all take care of them i&#x27;m a barber and iv&#x27;e had one for 6 years still working.</li>
    <li> i really do think that the blades have changed meaning that it seems that only the bottom blade slides back and fourth while the top blade is stationary.  when i had my M3 andi clippers i found that i could do my precise shaving because the top blade slid back and fourth as well. i hope i am saying this right, i am not a barber and do not know the proper terminology.  this is something that i have noticed with my new purchase of these clippers.  i also noticed that sometimes when i plug them into the wall, i get a very low or faint buzz and when i go to trim my mustache its like they are not even on? i would strongly recommend that you test the clippers out before you purchase if at all possible...</li>
    <li> I really liked this trimmer. I bought it with the extra attachments for managing my beard but unfortunately it stopped turning on after a year. It looks like there are a lot of complaints on google regarding the power switch breaking. For such a simple tool I expected it to last longer.</li>
    <li> The machine I bought does not cut well due ti lack of power. I would not recommend anyone to buy from here</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was the proper trimmer to by if you were shaving or doing an outline of your hair but the description was correct and it is one of the quietest trimmers I have ever used. I would buy from the seller again.</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair, so I needed a durable/reliable pair of edgers. The price was about $30 cheaper than the store, and I love them. They have already paid for themselves.</li>
    <li> I love these clippers! there are easy to handle plus it cuts so close to my beard, just the way i like. I will difinately recommend this product to my friends. The seller was also prompt on service. Overall i had a great experience.</li>
    <li> I use this trimmer mostly to &#x27;shave&#x27; once or twice a week, and it does the job perfectly. I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product. I was sick of ingrown hairs and such from dermatologically unfriendly razor blades, so I switched to this. Good move! I highly recommend this bad boy.</li>
    <li> i brought this as a Christmas gift for my fiance, based on the reviews he had received from his buddies- since they all shave daily. He loves it. The only complaint he has is that the trimmer gets extremely hot if you use it for a certain amount of time.  To that I told him. maybe you should shave faster,(lol)  and he said regardless, it shoudn&#x27;t get so hot, that he has to put it down, let it cool off and the start again. He did some research online and saw that there was a cooling oil you can purchase for it , to help with the inconvenience...I think it should have recommended that during the purchase.  That was his only complaint- and the reason for the 4 start rating, other than that he&#x27;s loves it.</li>
    <li> Still use to this day and i  bought it 2 years ago. Still works and keeps me well groomed. Use at least 2 times a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it to trim my beards and mustaches, though mostly beards.  I&#x27;ve even used it on a couple of occasions to shave my head.  i would not recommend this unless you have extra fine hair like I do.  All usage stats here are based on being used on finer hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I bought this online at shaver shop ~1999.  I use it about weekly for cleanup that not covered by shaving.  I put a single drop of fine oil on the blades  maybe 4 times a year and spray with an aerosol Shaver Saver spray after ever use.  This will give your bathroom that Barbershop - not salon - smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve replaced the blades a couple of years ago, its not wort the hassle to me to go get a $10 blade sharpened.  The product is very forgiving about not keeping up maintenance.  Switch on, blades don&#x27;t move.  Switch off, loosen two screws, apply drop of fine oil, on and continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like it should be in a Barbershop,  it feels like it in your hand, and is sturdy like it too.</li>
    <li> Great Price for these clippers and I shopped around. Delivery came as expected. Have used these clippers for 25 years for close shave and tapering hair. Addicted!</li>
    <li> Trimmers are already  Sharp  out the box gives a good lining</li>
    <li> Andis is my only choice for barber tools and this T-Outliner didn&#x27;t disappoint. Andis was what i went with after very thorough research, don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase. Just remember, just like clippers brush hair out of the blades, sanitize, and oil (I use Andis clipper oil only) after each use!</li>
    <li> This trimmer seriously wounded me. It gets so hot that have a red burn rash all over my skin. There should be serious warnings regarding the clipper. Currently treating my burns with aloe vera.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after buying (Wahl Professional 8110 5-star Series Balding Clipper) - Andis T-Outliner Trimmer with T-Blade (04710) is a good product specially if you like to shave your head every week. It is not as sharp as the Wahl product, so I am more comfortable using it. Just make sure you oil it before and after each use to preserve the machine and sharpness. I am just a regular customer helping other customers making informed decisions.</li>
    <li> Best shave without irritation from an actual blade. Would reccomend to any guy.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my own hair for the last 4 years. These outliners are affordable, easy to use, and used by most professionals.</li>
    <li> Andis seem to be the best, if you are a professional using them every day my wife does I would recommend these.</li>
    <li> I am a white male, and I am extremely prone to razor bumps and ingrown hairs. I have tried many different traditional razors, including both the Mach3 and an old-fashioned safety razor with double-edged blades. In addition, I have tried both rotary and foil electric razors. I even tried chemical depilatories. All of these resulted in my neck being a complete inflamed mess the next day. This trimmer actually prevents this. It obviously does not shave as close as these other methods, so I am left with some stubble. However, because it does not shave as close, I get none of the irritation that came with the other methods. My neck is no longer red at all, and I discover maybe one ingrown hair each time I shave. I am extremely glad I discovered this product for dry shaving.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Everything was as expected!</li>
    <li> Great product. Got delivered super quick. Great for detailing and fading. Great for professional use or at home care, even that in between haircut time just to touch up lines</li>
    <li> Works great, but does not come with any attachments - you need to order separately.</li>
    <li> I was just thinking about this today while using it. I really like it and I don&#x27;t know where any of the negative reviews come from. It still sharp and it cuts very close. I was worried about it getting to hot like I read in some reviews or if it will stay sharp. I even bought a extra blade just in case but so far so good even though I haven&#x27;t had it long. I use it at least once a week. I use it to cut the hair on my head and i get a really close cut. Almost like using an electric razor. Once cut I can go almost two weeks but I like this so much I use it once a week and it&#x27;s quick. Glad my brother suggested it. Thanks bro.</li>
    <li> The shipping was quick. Trims beautifully, would recommend to anybody looking for a trimmer that cuts as close as an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steven T</li>
    <li> This is the perfect trimmer/shaver I have bought in a long time.  Cuts very close.  Don&#x27;t expect it to be as close to a razor shave, but it&#x27;s really close to it.</li>
    <li> this shipping took seemingly forever this was one of my first orders but it just got to me I was going to use it this morning but something is wrong with it but I just have to loosen the blades and oil it thats all</li>
    <li> This took my husband&#x27;s haircuts to a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; level!  I love that it is corded so that I don&#x27;t need to worry about charging/running out of charge.  I just wish it had an additional small head to trim around the ears--then I&#x27;d have to start charging my husband for his haircuts....</li>
    <li> Get the Andis Zero Gap tool for this if you want to adjust it correctly &amp; repeatably w/o lumping &amp; cutting people up. This &amp; the Oster Fast Feed w/ the Andis magnetic guards for the Fast Feed are legit.</li>
    <li> Andis T-Outliner Trimmer</li>
    <li> Great clippers. These things get super close to the scalp. I use them to shave my head.</li>
    <li> perfect lines and cool through trimming hairline even on kids who cant sit still</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good quality clipper but the metal blades rust very easily and I&#x27;ve had to use steel wool to file it down.</li>
    <li> buying the andis trimmer was one of the best decisions i have ever made.  my facial hair grows in a million different directions.  if i shave with a traditional razor, even ones designed for sensitive skin, i end up with razor bumps and ingrown hairs.  i had purchased the norelco senso touch 3d electric razor and was not happy with the results.  it left clumps of hair unshaven on my neck, chin, and mustache area.  and i was left with razor bumps once again.  with the andis trimmer, i could have a few days worth of stubble and it still cuts through it without effort.  it gives me the closest shave possible (im left with basically a 5 oclock shadow) without any razor bumps or ingrown hairs.  it is able to trim my facial hair evenly, even on my neck.  i will never shave with anything else for the rest of my life.  if you have skin problems that result from shaving, i urge you to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> The blades are nice and sharp, cut clean, only downside is the blades get really hot really fast. I recommend getting the Cool Care Plus spray to go along with this, it cools the blades down and acts as a disinfectant too, as well as a lubricant for your blades.</li>
    <li> makes me feel like a pro</li>
    <li> I use this trimmer once a week it takes about 5 minutes to get a perfect trim&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i had it for about 2 months now and its working great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For 49.99 i think its a really good value and may be the best on the market&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i highly recommenced this trimmer especially if you don&#x27;t have much time to shave</li>
    <li> Crap. They don&#x27;t cut hardly. They pull if the neck hair is thick. They nip the ear and I hate that. Nips the neck.. The feel of them in the hand is. Ice but the biting is a no go for me. I threw them away 2 weeks of use</li>
    <li> I had bought one of these trimmers before, but dropped it and could not fix the tip. This Andis model is very sharp and does a very good job. The only difference in this one is that the switch is a little longer than the last one. I do recommend this model. I just wish that the makers of these hair cutters would make the cords shorter because only barbers need it that long.</li>
    <li> This is the second machine I have bought in the past 6 months. They both died after 3 months of use and I can&#x27;t even return them. I can&#x27;t find the warranty papers for both (or maybe I threw them out) but it is RIDICULOUS that the same thing happens in less than 3 months between each purchase and now all I can do is throw it out like I did the last one.</li>
    <li> I use this exclusively for shaving. Keep it oiled and you will have a shave every bit as good as a razor shave, with no mess, and most importantly no irritation. I also must say that this trimmer is the highest quality of any clipper that I own. I cut my own hair so I have a few clippers at home; this unit is by far the most well made. The motor is extremely powerful and the fit and build quality is such that I would be truly shocked if this trimmer doesn&#x27;t last at least ten years.</li>
    <li> Andis trimmer is used by almost every barber at barbershops i have been to. The quality is good, it doesn&#x27;t hurt you even with a hard press, unlike the wahl 5-star I owned before. The sharpness is great too, my edge up is as straight as barbershop quality. You can tell this trimmer got strong motor because it shakes pretty hard. The only thing bad is it gets hot kinda quick but I don&#x27;t really edge me up everyday so it&#x27;s not a big deal for me. Can&#x27;t complain about this trimmer</li>
    <li> Muy buena maquina para hacer cortes de pelo , para la barba , para cualquier parte del cuerpo esta buenisima esta maquina , bueno la marca andis es una marca muy prestigiosa , lo bueno es bueno aqui y en cualquier planeta</li>
    <li> These clippers are CLASSIC. They work very well. Several barbers use them and they have a long track record. My item showed up on time, still had the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; smell to them and they work fantastic. There&#x27;s a tube of oil included too as well. Andis makes great clippers!</li>
    <li> These are some good clippers for close shavings or doing edges, but they get exteremely hot if in use for a while. They also get lots of hair inside the body of the clippers, so they need to be broken down and cleaned periodically if used a lot. Overall, I do like these clippers still... :-)</li>
    <li> I barley started cutting hair 6 months ago, I have tried the wahl hero first, from seeing videos on youtube i saw  that the andis T-outliner was a great liner but i&#x27;ve used it and its not as good as the wahl hero but it still cuts pretty good but i wouldn&#x27;t change it for my wahl hero.</li>
    <li> My sister is a barber and she uses these trimmers so my expectation was high and the did not disappoint.</li>
    <li> I told my barber I bought one of these and he was angry.&lt;br /&gt;These are for professionals ONLY.&lt;br /&gt;WHY?&lt;br /&gt;Because they are the only ones that ACTUALLY work.&lt;br /&gt;THESE are the best trimmers I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I have bought 12-15 different trimmers over the years.&lt;br /&gt;This are the last ones.&lt;br /&gt;They last forever....I hope they still do...</li>
    <li> i purchased this item like 2 months ago and never got around to use it. Tried it first time and knew something was wrong. The guide blade plate was cracked and it wont work and now i cant even return it or get it exchanged ....</li>
    <li> I returned this trimmers after the first use because of the heat issue. These trimmers were so hot after 20 minutes of on and off use that they basically seized up and stopped trimmer hair all together. Do not recommend if u plan on using them for more then ten minutes at a time</li>
    <li> I bought this item in hopes it would replace my Wahl Peanut Trimmer, I was wrong, although is not a waste and I will still use it, it is still a pain in the neck for me at least.&lt;br /&gt;Yes it does gives me a very very close shave, barely leaves anything behind but it lacks in another department, it needs several passes in the same area or you are leaving quite a few hairs behind, that happened to me on my back and neck and face as well. My peanut trimmer it&#x27;s close to this one when it comes to shaving except is not as close but it is twice as fast and 4 times smaller with the same power or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer also if it takes you a bit to shave it gets extremely hot, not the blade but the machine itself to the point you can barely hold it in your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a quick shave, this is not for you, just get the Wahl Peanut Trimmer, if you want a really close shave and have the time then go for it, fyi, it gets really hot pretty fast!!!</li>
    <li> they work great, a bit scratched on the blade.</li>
    <li> Fantastic buzzer!  I would have like the plug to be made stronger.</li>
    <li> I just received the Andis T-Outliner trimmer 04710. I purchased it as a Christmas gift for my son. My daughter had ordered one for her cousin two months earlier. He had nothing but great things to say about it. He was even concerned about her spending that much money(which he was guessing it had to have cost). I was looking forward to my son to be just as ecstatic about his:but now I am in a pickle. It came sooner than the estimated date:I was very pleased about that. But it also came opened box and it looked used it had small scratches on the blade and it seemed oily with like fragments of material shedding . Now I am debating whether to return it and reorder hoping it will arrive before Christmas(a week away).</li>
    <li> Wonderful and the shipping was super fast.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t try to reinvent the wheel. I have own this product years back and have purchased it again ... I love it, it stands the test of time. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> great machine cuts like a pro!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> great product and shipped fast!! A + + + + + + + + + + + + + +</li>
    <li> A great trimmer; it gives me a royal cut. For those who travel internationally, be sure not to try plugging it into a 220V socket.</li>
    <li> great buy would buy again!</li>
    <li> It wouldn&#x27;t be very good</li>
    <li> The clipper is a 5 star item. They fact that they no longer include the plastic grooming attachments is 1 star behavior that truly detracts from this outstanding, user friendly, durable clipper.  You have to order the clipping accesories separately.</li>
    <li> Cuts great as always especially with new blades every 6 months. However, the blades get so hot with 30 minutes of use that it can scald the back of my head it i decide to continue beyond 30 mins. and this is with routine oiling before each use. I guess the maximum continuous use time is 30 mins. But it works and has saved me a vault of cash</li>
    <li> The T-Outliner works just as expected.  I particularly like the redesign of the on-off switch and the electric cord plug.</li>
    <li> I love Andis and this was to be my 3rd new clipper in 10 years. They stand the test of time and this clipper in particular is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold....That is why I was extremely disappointed when it seemed as if I was sent used clippers when I was under the impression I bought new ones. It looked brand new, but when I turned it on it sounded like a loose screw was bobbling about inside the clipper. On examining I did indeed see a missing screw and now I feel like I&#x27;ve been had. I want to return and get a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; Andis T-Outliner but don&#x27;t want to pay shipping. I don&#x27;t think I should be responsible for that do you?  Still in need of &amp;#34;NEW&amp;#34; Clipper....</li>
    <li> 3 months in and still working great. I bought it as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. He loves this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Actually I&#x27;m not happy with this machine, I bought it on the recommendation of a friend who told me about their quality, but now do not know if buying a clothes iron or microwave in less than 5 minutes and the unit is extremely hot, both shelled as its power cord that deserves need to stop using it for long periods while cooled again for fear of bursting, for that I have to put off the outlet air conditioning. I had no choice but to stick with my old machine of another brand. Therefore not adhered to this acquisition and now as a former user does not recommend this machine for anything. Bad investment on my part ...</li>
    <li> While getting duded-up at local barber shop, this trimmer worked so well I asked what it was. Bought it for myself and use it as my all around shaver and trimmer. The extra bucks it cost will be worth it. Very well made. Does require some oiling and cleaning but if you don&#x27;t need a close shave, this will work better than most.</li>
    <li> The blade that came with the machine was totally damaged &amp; my husband was unable to use the machine till he found a place that sold the blades to purchase one.</li>
    <li> Using the Andis T-Outliner Trimmer is like using a razor.  We are very please with this trimmer.</li>
    <li> I am initially impressed with this trimmer.  Time will tell how well it lasts, but so far I&#x27;m impressed.  All the positive reviews on this product are accurate as far as I can tell.</li>
    <li> Love it and it came on time...  thank you</li>
    <li> Does not work properly at times.</li>
    <li> I have bought multiple sets of these trimmers from different places. Their quality is s*** and they do not last. Eventually all they do is make the most irritating noise. I am done buying anything from Andis. Spend your money on a different brand. If they had an option for zero stars, that is what they would get from me!</li>
    <li> The trimmer never work from the start. I sent the trimmer back immediately.</li>
    <li> I bought a Wahl razor/clippers from Walmart that I used around 20 times. Needless to say that was a waste. It was loud, didn&#x27;t last and didn&#x27;t give an even shave. I shaved with my Andis in less than half the time. It&#x27;s fairly quiet and it gives an even shave without going over the same spot many times. It doesn&#x27;t clip to the bare skin and it will for the most part leave light stubble. After reading reviews I chose to give it a try. I hope I can get several years use from it like a lot of the review posters have. So far I&#x27;m happy and it&#x27;s a good way to save money on expensive disposable blades.</li>
    <li> I was recommended these clippers by a friend who is a barber. He said he uses them daily for trim work, line work and doing light shaving/fades. He said they were good \\&quot;every day clippers\\&quot;. Being a pro, I took his advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I can stay that they do good for what they were made for (lining/trimming), they are not good for what I was going to use them for.. cutting thick 1/4 to 1/2 inch hair to bald every 3-4 weeks. I typically like to run an electric all over, get me to that \\&quot;1-2 days of growth\\&quot; look and then hit it with a multi-blade razor to get that baby butt smooth. This one worked fine the first few strokes but it definitely showed it&#x27;s weakness as I used it. Binds up quickly. Blades don&#x27;t have the travel they need to be effective against thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it&#x27;s good at what it does, don&#x27;t expect it to perform miracles. I&#x27;ve since switched to a Wahl Balding Razor and it&#x27;s night and day difference for how I use it.</li>
    <li> Great product, simply the best out there.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend for anyone that has trouble shaving with razors, or dealing with razor bumps. Andis T Liner cuts very close to the skin without the irritation and razor bumps that follow shaving skin with razor. Quality product at a fair price!</li>
    <li> New as advertised and arrived quickly.. great set of clippers for a line up. my barber uses these so I looked on amazon as I was in the chair so i can have it for the road when traveling.</li>
    <li> In terms of pure function, the product is okay, it trims closer than the Oster T-Blade trimmer that it is replacing. That is the only good thing about the Andis T-Blade trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything else about the product is awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First there is the smell. The first trimmer I received smelled so bad that I had to box it up and return it to Amazon. It stank up my house and gave me a headache. The second is only marginally better. I let it air out in the basement for a week before moving it to the bathroom. After six weeks of almost daily use I still get a pungent acrid burnt smell after each use, but at least the headaches have gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build quality. If this was a free toy that had been manufactured in 1960&#x27;s China perhaps the sharp edges on the non matching halves of the plastic enclosure would be acceptable. Acceptable for a throw away, but not for a tool designed to be used day after day for many years. That Andis ever let a product with such shoddy build quality out the door is testament to the companies complete disregard for product quality. Who ever does quality control (or rather doesn&#x27;t) must be stuck in the 1940&#x27;s. I called Andis HQ and asked to speak with someone in QC to find out if my two samples just happened to have slipped out the door, but of course, no one returned my call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomics. Who was the genius who placed the on off switch furthest away from your fingers, so that you cant flick it on and off without transferring the device to your other hand. Pure genius.  To say that this device was designed by an engineer and not a designer would be to slander 99.9% of a profession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vibration. It vibrates. Not to the point of leaving your hand numb, but more than I would expect a so called professional level tool to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why have I kept the trimmer? Because I have gone through two Oster trimmers which didn&#x27;t cut as close as this does. The second trimmer vibrated even more than this Andis so my choice is between a light weight consumer product designed to last a few years with a less powerful motor and non removable batteries or this solid 110v, but junkally built ergonomic disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving the product 3 stars because it trims closer and vibrates a little less than the competition, but everything else about it is a disaster.ce is between a light weight consumer product designed to last a few years with a less powerful motor and non removable batteries or this solid 110v, but junkally built ergonomic disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving the product 3 stars because it trims closer and vibrates a little less than the competition, but everything else about it is a disaster.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
    <li> Same clippers that my barber uses. I have a beard and I like it looking fresh. This is great for dry shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these clippers for about 7 years and I have no complaints. I use them about twice a week for trimming and the only maintenance I&#x27;ve had to do is buy new blades periodically. Andis is what I use and they come highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Best purchase I made to date. Use them almost everyday!</li>
    <li> easy to use and crisp cut</li>
    <li> Took my career to new heights</li>
    <li> Should be in every grown man&#x27;s bathroom. Suppose any blade capable of being zero gapped would suffice. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Best liners I&#x27;ve ever had.  Also, got a haircut one day, and when I&#x27;m getting my lining, I look over at what my barber is using... and it&#x27;s these bad boys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One quick note of advice: Keep these out of the bathroom, or at least far from moisture.  They can and will rust if you don&#x27;t watch out.  There have been others that noticed this.</li>
    <li> I use these for shaving, prevent ingrown hairs and to touch up my hairline. One of my best investments. I save so much money, not having to buy blades every three days! Thank you Andis.</li>
    <li> Great for a quick shape up</li>
    <li> Great close cut. I use for shaving instead of razor. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Very close shave I use it every day</li>
    <li> Quality clippers. Perfect for anyone that requires a close trim.</li>
    <li> Does a great job on lining and shaving.</li>
    <li> I love My T-Liners, they do the job, I received them a few days before scheduled date and they were priced 20 dollars cheaper than Sallys Beauty.  Perfect gift for any man.</li>
    <li> I use this to cut my boys hair and it&#x27;s perfect for getting those hard to reach and delicate areas like behind the ears. I get perfect straight lines....</li>
    <li> This is what the pros use, buy these period. Do not buy cheaper clippers if you can afford these.The best, hands down.</li>
    <li> Rec&#x27;d this clipper today and outlined my beard and used comb attachment to cut a uniform height.  Have arthritis in my hands and fingers so I lack the fine motor skills I used to have.  This is a small, light weight trimmer which fits well in one&#x27;s hands.  It is also very maneuverable for shaping inside or outside curves.  Oiled blades first per directions, dip running blade in Andis \\&quot;Blade Care\\&quot; to clean blades after use and applied more oil to blades. (per instructions) Cut very well and handles very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was born and raised in Racine, Wisconsin where these are made.  I know people who worked in the factory.  They were very proud of their professional clippers and I can see why.  I urge readers to purchase products like this made in the USA which keeps American workers employed.  This is an excellent value for the price.</li>
    <li> opened the box and the clippers were nice. Plugged them in and they started off loud but I figured they just needed some adjusting. 45 seconds in they completely die. Couldnt even finish what I started.</li>
    <li> I love these clippers! They cut really close. I&#x27;m African American and I mainly use these to shave my face because I don&#x27;t wanna get razor bumps. I use them to edge my head too. They are really top of the line clippers. They do get hot if left on for awhile. Using these makes me feel like a pro until I gap myself up but I really like using them and I&#x27;m going to give these to my cousin and buy another set</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this trimmer. Very professional, precise, and strong. It surpassed all expectations and is running like new months later. I cut my hair as well as others with this trimmer and the outlining is phenomenal. Would recommend it to anyone interested in getting it. Lead me to buy other andis products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used plenty of product from Andis and the quality is always consistent. I&#x27;ve never had a bad experience. This a brand you can definitely trust.</li>
    <li> nice sharp barbershop cut after blades are adjusted i would definitely recommend, out of the box they seemed a little dull but after adjusting there perfect</li>
    <li> As a Naval Captain, my body hair can get pretty out of control when I&#x27;m at sea.  When I&#x27;m at port or asking Glomgold for some sponsorship cash, I need to look my best.  Be sure to oil it regularly or the performance will degrade.</li>
    <li> The only drawback of is that it does get fairly hot after prolonged use. If you&#x27;re a professional barbe you may want to consider a grip for the T-outliner if not just have two on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those just grooming themselves at home you should have no problem with it getting to hot.</li>
    <li> Alright so I have had two of these.  My first one last over a  year and was great.  No major problems or anything.  I like to have a close trim, but not shave because of in-grown hairs.  That one died randomly one morning.  Since I had success with it I figured I would buy another one and try to take better care of it.  I bought my last one this past spring.  It died this morning randomly.  This is frustrating because I have taken better care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I am going with a new brand this time.  I can&#x27;t say its all bad because when it works, its fine.  However, with two dying in 2 years just out of the blue i&#x27;ll take a chance on something else.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this. It give a nice smooth shave.</li>
    <li> i really love this product</li>
    <li> Super great pair of liners bought a pair &amp; i used it for about 5 min &amp; it turned of &amp; didnt  want to turn on i contacted amazon &amp; they sent me another pair &amp; it works great 👌</li>
    <li> The first one I bought lasted six months before crapping out. The second one I bought lasted 2 weeks.  I&#x27;ve always loved Andis; they generally make great stuff, but perhaps it&#x27;s better to pay the $80 in the store for the real thing.</li>
    <li> good quality i like it</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband but I also use it.It is fantastic...great product...I would highly  recommend buying this product</li>
    <li> Love these trimmers! Great purchase!</li>
    <li> This is my second Andis Outliner in about 20 years. It&#x27;s works great and lasts long if you maintain it properly.</li>
    <li> good professional quality, great price, and the  fact that it&#x27;s made in america is a added bonus, I would by again.</li>
    <li> I love this clipper.  It cuts very clean and very close.  I no longer have to go to the barber.&lt;br /&gt;Yes it gets a little hot but that is usually around the time I am finishing up.  For the price you will not get a better long lasting clipper.</li>
    <li> This item was purchased as a replacement for an old one which worked well before it was dropped......my boyfriend specifically asked for this model because he says it shaves close and nice.</li>
    <li> I am a budget shopper and i saw these same  clippers at a local hair and beauty store for $59. I purchased  the same pair on Amazon for $47 you  can&#x27;t beat that price. The clippers cuts perfectly and runs smoothly compared to other T-liners. I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Professional\\&quot; - Yes, this thing is that.  Once you plug it in and turn it on, you know you&#x27;re dealing with a high powered product.  The cut is great and I expect many years of use.  The unit is a little heavy and the cord could stand to be a bit longer, but there is no doubt this is a good value.</li>
    <li> its kool and very nice ..........its kool and very nice ..........its kool and very nice ..........its kool and very nice ..........</li>
    <li> Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer is great to shape up or line up your face. Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer is a great thing to have.</li>
    <li> It arrived to me on time, BUT it wasn&#x27;t able to cut the hairs on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I took it to my Barber, who had to have the Blades adjusted.&lt;br /&gt;He said for the most part, that is how the machine comes to the customer</li>
    <li> This is a awesome product. I used them for years now and they still doing the job and doing it rite. I&#x27;m still using the same blades that was on it when I purchased.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is good but not perfect and nothing is. I think for the money it should be a little better with the trimming aspect . But it will suffice .</li>
    <li> I purchased this trimmer to shape up my beard and sideburns. It seems to work pretty well but I have since stopped using them and went back to a regular Gillette.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works great, i no longer need a costly razor to shave my head.</li>
    <li> Over all very reliable I have been cutting for over 10years and this is only my second one.  Still have my first set but I dropped them and chipped them and they still work.</li>
    <li> Very, very good, is the best machine, that I used.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, I like it</li>
    <li> Great product just as described everything arrived in super good condition and worked as its suppose too..</li>
    <li> I use this to shave my head.  Does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;I finish with my regular electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;Gets the job done fast.</li>
    <li> This is a great buy for someone like me who is always travelling. It cuts really close and never fails</li>
    <li> I use this on my boyfriends beard. He likes it trimmed up and this does a great job. It gets really close to the skin and is easy to use. I also do a shape up on his hair and it gets nice clean lines.</li>
    <li> I hate these the other ones that i had were great this pair is a horrible buy. the blades were dull when i got them so i cant cut nothing with these at all</li>
    <li> now i can start cutting hair</li>
    <li> yes, as soon as I got them I lined my self up and they are alot better than the cheap liners I bought. As soon as they warm up they cut sharp...</li>
    <li> Although it&#x27;s not cordless, but I like so much.&lt;br /&gt;I hope there is same design but cordless with dual voltage!</li>
    <li> Got as a gift and the person loves it</li>
    <li> Product was new and works great.</li>
    <li> This is the fourth Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer...works as it states with a perfect outline...and I shave my face with these clippers...it prevent bumps...and I will continue to purchase Andis products from Amazon.com....</li>
    <li> This is what the pros use @ barber shops. I personally got it for my own personal use so that I don&#x27;t have to shave. It is just perfect. I use it on my entire body and it works great.</li>
    <li> I am retired.  Shave when I feel like like it.  This trimmer does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in America.  Nuf said...</li>
    <li> I read all the ratings and comments for this item and iI have to say its the best for doing line ups! love this product!</li>
    <li> recommended by barber</li>
    <li> sharp blade out of the box. no bumps, didn&#x27;t pull. im in there. still gonna get the andis blade zero gapper to really get the full effect and sharpest lines</li>
    <li> arrived this morning and it ran flawlessly! I &amp;#34; zero gapped &amp;#34; it so it lines up super sharp. Got this for home use. also the $38 price tag which included free expedited shipping was the icing on the cake!!</li>
    <li> This is my second T-outliner I lost my first one on vacation had it for over five years..Andis products are very good this one however is more silent than my previous one</li>
    <li> these are not worth wasting your money on Enough said you will be disappointed if you buy these dont waste your time or money</li>
    <li> Awesome. This is a great product. Love it.</li>
    <li> I would recommend it to you guys also.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the item.&lt;br /&gt;It helps me shave with no problems at all</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand of liners for over twenty years and I think Andis makes the best Outliners. They are price right and worth it.</li>
    <li> I have owned these clippers for nearly a year. They cut just as precisely now as they did when I bought them new. The wide blade is very nice and requires less strokes. I use these clippers about once a week to clean up my fade/blowout. They cut really thin, as thin as the barbers, only they will not cut razor thin. I have yet to see anything that does cut razor thin besides a razor. These clippers are the closest you can get to a barber chair for your home. I am so sold on the quality of this brand/line that I just purchased the \\&quot;Improved Master Clippers\\&quot; to accompany my \\&quot;T-Outliner\\&quot;. It set me back a hundred bucks but if it is at all like the T-outliner than I will be extremely happy. You get what you pay for and oh yes, don&#x27;t forget to keep them oiled! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> It is a great item my husband loves it but it did not come with the T-blade and was packaged poorly.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day as my primary shaving tool. I find using a product such as this to effectively eliminate or diminish the chance of ingrown hairs on my face or neck. It gives a very clean and close &#x27;shave&#x27; in a hurry. The hi-speed movement of the blades ensures it does not pull hairs or jam, as many inferior products do. (Such as the majority of mainstream under-100$ products (by Panasonic, Norelco (Philips), Remington) do. I feel at this price point I have found the pinnacle of daily shaving devices. (The twice-the-price Oster model (767) also looks promising, but not for my needs.)</li>
    <li> These are perfect for dry shaving...very close, but not enough to leave bumps on my face.</li>
    <li> I need to buy another one. My first one short circuited and didn&#x27;t work in the friggin&#x27; bathrooms anymore. Sharp line doe.</li>
    <li> Cuts real nice but you need to set the blades up probably otherwise it won&#x27;t cut. Once you do that it will be good to go.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my husband as gift because he&#x27;s had the hardest time finding a trimmer that gives him a close shave without irritation. Eureka, he&#x27;s finally found it! He loves the shave but hates the noise. He wakes up the neighborhood every morning when he shaves, that&#x27;s how loud it is. Great trimmer but for the noise.</li>
    <li> Solid construction and a great price. You will be hard pressed to find a better deal than this one. I would definitely recommend this item.</li>
    <li> This model is being raved about by barber every corner you search. How do barbers like this trimmer I have no clue, but it gets very hot, super fast and the heat from the blade irritates the skin.  Another problem is the design is so backwards that cleaning the head is a time consuming nightmare since you need to remove screws all the time.  In  addition, I found the body too be too bulky and oddly shaped for ergonomic handling.  Consumer grade trimmers have performed better, cut cleaner and felt better in my hands than this raved professional trimmer.</li>
    <li> My dad has been a barber for years now...He says these are the best to use....and he has been using them for a long time...</li>
    <li> These edgers are great... Gives a very sharp edge up once I adjusted them.  I recommend to anyone who are looking to purchase them.</li>
    <li> I HAVE MY WIFE TAPE ME UP EVERY TIME, JUST AS GOOD AS THE BARBER SHOP! GREAT PRICE AND QUALITY PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Great trimmer,  it was like magic how my bumps disappeared after the first use. Its shaves smooth, clean and quite. 1 thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it gets hot if plugged for too long</li>
    <li> These did a great job when I cut other people&#x27;s hair. They did not do so well cutting my own hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have mixed and have straight to curly hair and I couldn&#x27;t get these to line me up for nothing. I retuned them and went back to the Peanut.</li>
    <li> Was recommended by my barber. Does we&#x27;ll. just gets very hot after a while of it being on. May need to take a break to cool it off for extended use.</li>
    <li> The Andis Professional T-Outliner Trimmer are a must for men who wants to keep his hairline in order and on point, these clippers are smooth as butter and very easy to shape hair around your face to your justifications.</li>
    <li> very sharp blade for a sharp professional edge right out the box (just need to adjust). no need to look any further, would recommend. could last a lifetime, believe me I have another one I&#x27;ve had for 30+ yrs. just needed a new blade so I decided to just buy the whole clipper.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY. Health hazard literally! Coated in foul smelling chemical oil like substance that made me sick. Piece of garbage device that is literally a health hazard.</li>
    <li> fell and broke the blade very weak, but it trims very close</li>
    <li> The blade that came with my trimmer (bought from here) was dull. I am already aware that you had to readjust the blade on Andis T-Outliner trimmers but after several readjusting, the blade remained dull. I decided to put back on the old blade (from my old T-Outliner trimmers) and my old blade was sharp like a new blade. I came to the conclusion that the blade that came with this purchase was simply dull and worn out.</li>
    <li> Worked great, until today. It makes noise but won&#x27;t cut any hair. do not buy it will not last long!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought another on sept 29/2015, and now its october 5 and its not trimming AGAIN. This is my third trimmer, exactly the same one. And this is one stop trimming after 2 month of use. I oil it before I use every single time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In anyway this is garbage do not buy. I works great, bit only a fww months or so.</li>
    <li> This is the official clipper that barbers use, the only thing is that you cant be using it for too long because it gets very hot, factory blade is good enough no need to buy another one or even adjust them.</li>
    <li> Easy to handle; lightweight.  Does a great job.</li>
    <li> Very nice outliner, this trimmer has an excellent long history  behind it. My Dad is a barber for 60 years he recommended this to me.</li>
    <li> Very good trimmer especially for those of us who cut our own hair.&lt;br /&gt;I just saw a u-tube video on how to adjust the blades. I had thought it was not cutting as sharp as it used to, so Bought a new blade replacement. I should have kept the old blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will adjust the blade to a zero tolerance and will report back on the outcome.</li>
    <li> Husband loved these Clippers they cut really close for a bald head look</li>
    <li> This is intended for professional barbers. If you are looking for an electric trimmer for at-home use, buy the Wahl 9818 Lithium Ion Stainless Steel All-in-one Groomer.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible product. I would recommend this outliner to anyone looking to get a proffesional styled cut.</li>
    <li> You can never go wrong with one of these!</li>
    <li> very good, saves time on doing line ups.</li>
    <li> A standard essential in every man&#x27;s hygiene asset.</li>
    <li> I just got it and it seems to do what it dose I will try to zero gap it</li>
    <li> Good trimmer, it does its job. Only downside is it does heat up fairly quickly if use for a long time.</li>
    <li> I received my trimmers plugged them in to find that they made a really loud noise and got hot really quickly...very disappointed</li>
    <li> You have to a just them in order for them to cut and even then they barely work</li>
    <li> Great item and super fast shipping, this machine was the solution for my problem as i expected.</li>
    <li> This will get as close to your head as possible without a razor blade. Barber quality product.</li>
    <li> Does a clean job in shape ups and shaving and my clients say it isn&#x27;t so sharp so they don&#x27;t get cuts or lacerations during facial shaves.</li>
    <li> My husband gives this five stars. He tells me other men will like it too.</li>
    <li> Shaves smooth without kinks.  Sharp blades. My bf loved having this set of trimmers!</li>
    <li> Extremely good liners</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a razor this good. I have a lot of facial hair.  A LOT. And where other razors whine and crap out, the Andis T-Outliner boldly declares, &amp;#34;Is that all you got? Give me a challenge.&amp;#34; The first time I switched it on, I knew things would never be the same.</li>
    <li> Good product so far came very fast</li>
    <li> I bought these after doing a lot of research. I wasn&#x27;t sure whether to get the regular trimmer blade, or the T-outliner. I decided on the T-outliner sine the blades were supposed to cut the same shortness. These things cut like a dream. I use them on my face to get the hair as short as possible before I use a regular razor. Sometimes I don&#x27;t even use a razor because these babies cut really close. I also use them when cutting my friends&#x27; hair. They work amazing as outliners, hence that is what they are designed for. You have to be careful because you can knick someone&#x27;s neck or ears if you are pressing too hard against the skin. I would definitely recommend these. Much better than cheap store bought ones.</li>
    <li> The box was a little bit beat up but besides that, I didn&#x27;t have any trouble getting it. Came in fast and it works great.</li>
    <li> From the moment you turn this clipper on you can feel the power and you know it means business it works great for my two boy&#x27;s and I.  We clean and oil it after every use and it pay&#x27;s for itself after two to three uses.</li>
    <li> Worked as expected.  Sturdy unit.  No pain close cut hair trimmer/edger. Great Trimmer!  Would definitely recommend for the price.  Get it.</li>
    <li> The best ! i use it almost every day on my neck and too outline my facial hair. The best purchase by far . i have sensitive skin also and the fact i can use it everyday it amazing</li>
    <li> Very nice cut. Would recommend. Super sharp</li>
    <li> It cuts the same as the Oster T Finisher. I don&#x27;t like how the power switch is in the bottom center. I prefer it to be on the side. The Styliner is much better.</li>
    <li> Great product and service</li>
    <li> Great clippers. Very sharp</li>
    <li> Product stopped working and will not turn on.</li>
    <li> If it was quite I would have given it 5</li>
    <li> have had this for some time now. All i changed were the blades. Once the blades are adjusted properly this unit works great.</li>
    <li> The only trimmers that you will ever need!</li>
    <li> Excellent. My barber used this. Works well and is made solid.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift for my adult son for Christmas.  It was what he asked for and he has reported being very satisfied with it.  The order was received as promised and in great condition.  I would recommend this item and would purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> These are the liners that the pros use. I&#x27;ve been through a few different sets of clippers and liners over the years and they all eventually broke or stopped working properly. So I finally buckled down and purchased these bad boys. I have 3 boys and I cut all of their hair. These paid for themselves after the second cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They feel good in the hand. The weight is nice and heavy. You know your holding a finely tuned machine. I would have given them a 5, but they do get a little hot to the touch after multiple cuts or extended use. Also they don&#x27;t come with a case so you should find one those. The box is only going to last for so long.</li>
    <li> I love them I feel like a professional barber lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these clippers for years, I&#x27;m in the military, and suffer from PFB, so a daily razor is out of the question for my supple skin. When I shave I use these. I have shaved many a hair with it&#x27;s efficient blades with good results. You won&#x27;t get completely baby bottom smooth, and that&#x27;s a good thing when the hairs on your face are too lazy to fully surface out of your dermis. They take it to the very limit without leaving me all jacked up. If you want to see a before and after video, check this : [...]&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, if your a man you likely have a beard and enjoy keeping it clean and presentable. However, if unforseen situations should emerge involving your man fur (IE:Career, unsupportive spouse/girlfriend, being mistaken for taliban/mountain hermit), these clipperswill do for a face not to be touched by a razor! Get them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS:You can cut fun shapes into your body hair using these.Ask my wife how much she enjoyed the upside down arrow I carved onto my torso. Good times!</li>
    <li> If you drop these chances are the T will break. One of the corners in particular. Great quality and close shave without burn or bumps. Ive had them appx. 3/mos.</li>
    <li> use this to shave and to edge up the back of my neck great product</li>
    <li> Andis T-Outliner Trimmer went faulty, heated and non shave.</li>
    <li> This is a great set of clippers, high quality and gets it very close to the skin!</li>
    <li> My husband loves them!!!! They were definitely worth the money. I would definitely purchase them again in the future. Great product!!!</li>
    <li> My hubby like his neck trimmed once a week. We&#x27;ve used cheap trimmers where I&#x27;d have to go over the area numerous times and they would break within months. This product was recommended to us by the lady he gets his hair done at. It&#x27;s super heavy and solid, cuts the first time you go over, and leaves a nice straight line.</li>
    <li> Returning it. According to steveharvey.tv it was supposed to have attachment combs but came without attachments. I see that there is an attachment set that can be purchased separately for additional $14 but I am not paying for something that should have come with it. Why would you sell it without its attachments?</li>
    <li> I ordered this a month ago and the first time I tried it, I was very underwhelmed. It cut decent at best. There was still very noticeable stubble and I was thinking of sending it back. I checked videos YouTube and there were tutorials to zero gap the blade. I jumped on it and (while scared to death of cutting my throat the first time using it..) followed the tutorial. After that, this trimmer cuts super close. On my neck it&#x27;s equivalent to using a razor. On my cheeks it doesn&#x27;t get as close but it is still clean. They do get hot but I haven&#x27;t had to stop in the middle of a shave to let it cool down. Don&#x27;t be a baby. Just get these clippers.</li>
    <li> I purchased these trimmers in hopes that it would give me the closest and sharpest edge up I could get, and it didn&#x27;t disappoint. I usually cut my own hair and the edge up by fair is the most important part of the cut because it&#x27;s simply the cherry on top. I noticed that most barbers owned the Andis T-Outliner clippers so I finally decide to pull the trigger and I don&#x27;t regret it. After adjusting the blade a couple times to get a close cut without it actually being too sharp I was amazed at how good and sharp the cut looked. Even the straight edge razor I have couldn&#x27;t produce the sharp cut and convenience that comes with this product. I haven&#x27;t used it for shaving or trimming facial hair yet but I suppose tats just a bonus of owning such a good product, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer eva created when adjusted correctly u will get a sharp line. If ur like me n can&#x27;t shave with a regular razor bc u break this is ideal for dry shaving.  I recommend u shave twice daily; when u first wake up and b4 u go to sleep or wheneva u feel ur hair growing in, trust me this works!  The only downside I&#x27;d say to this product is after about 10-15mins i gets hot but other then that there&#x27;s no complaints but its def worth a try.  Good luck...</li>
    <li> I was really tired of the crappy trimmers that I seem to always buy from the local super-size retailer.  So, a couple of days ago, I asked the person cutting my hair where I could find a trimmer that works like the one she was using.  She recommended a store called Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply. Yes, the first thing that came to mind was the old Saturday Night Live skit \\&quot;That&#x27;s not manly......\\&quot;.  As that finished echoing through my mind and the goosbumps subsided, my next thought was, Amazon!!  Long story short, I managed to acquire an Andis T-Outliner without completely neutering my ego.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All kidding aside, this device has a good solid feel like a high quality long lasting device should have.  Not only that, it does an AMAZING job!  It didn&#x27;t pull a single hair out of my sideburns and it looks like I used a razor, not a trimmer, on the rest of my face!  I&#x27;d rather not have the power cord but, most cordless trimmers use cheap NiMH batteries which don&#x27;t have the power to do the job and go bad in a few months anyway.  This is a well built device, does a GREAT job, and is made in the USA. Cant beat that!</li>
    <li> excellent product, very useful,would buy and recommend Andis products to others. Shouldn&#x27;t have to write more than you wish to write.</li>
    <li> i do my own hair this tool does a great job outlining the edges, they got them to me fast.</li>
    <li> absolute garbage. stopped working 45 days and 4 haircuts after i bought it. that&#x27;s 3 pairs of And is in a row that haven&#x27;t even lasted a full year. piece of Sh*t!!!!!</li>
    <li> They are a very excellent product and shaves very well... If you have a beard I would suggest that you try this product by Andis it is a great tool to have for dry shaving...</li>
    <li> Exactly what i was lookin for. Gives a great shave and is quick for when your in a rush. Wish it came with clips though.</li>
    <li> Its been a couple years now and it still cuts well. I use it on my face to shorten my hair before shaving...if its been a few days. On occasion it tugs my hair, which I fricken hate, but in general it works great. Also good for trimming side burns, around ears, and boxing off back of neck.</li>
    <li> Does a professional job!  Have bought less durable trimmers in past.  This is solid built and should last a long time.</li>
    <li> I like the product but it started giving me bumps. I&#x27;m not sure if it was my techinque or the razor. i love it regardless though and now I use it once in a while and mainly use the hsvaing cream my soft sheen carson that just wipes the hair away.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is good but the blades must be adjusted first. The trimmer will not cut close out of the box. You have to adjust the blades to get them to cut close and even after that it isn&#x27;t always reliable. Mine stopped cutting altogether after a few months and I had to take it apart and play around with it to get it to work again. I don&#x27;t know if there is another trimmer that would work better but this one does a good job when it is adjusted and when they work. Things to consider before buying.</li>
    <li> I am like any guy out there looking for a closer trim.  I have tried countless trimmers and clippers and this is by far the best. Now only if I could have a steady hand. haha.... These are a bit heavier than I would have imagined but overall a great product.</li>
    <li> i like it, it gives a close cut, but it gets hot fast. added a drop or two of oil to see if cooled down the blade,  it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This shaving machine cuts pretty clean but it&#x27;s REALLY REALLY NOISY. I&#x27;m from Barbados &amp; I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the reason why but this machine has an ear splitting hum when it&#x27;s in use with a violent vibration</li>
    <li> Effectively trims to a &amp;#34;5 o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34;  so that I do not have to actually shave and get razor bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: been using this nearly 3 years now and it&#x27;s still going strong. I hardly even lube the thing, and have zero issues.</li>
    <li> Bought this like 6 years ago, I&#x27;ve had to change the blades a few times, but outside of that, it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> I like these better than my Styliner II&#x27;s. My Dad told me these were better and cut better than the Styliner II&#x27;s so I had to try it. Plus this is the typical trimmer that you see all barbers use. Very sharp, leaves a nice clean lining. Cord is thick, long and durable. I recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son.  He has no complaints about.  He uses this kind of trimmer anyway.  Andis T-Outliner is a very good trimmer as recommended by many of the barbers I asked before I made the final purchase.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is way too loud to use on some one. I can deal with a bit of noise but this was too much to deal with at all. Plus I think it came used I went to oil it before use and found hair. Returning asap</li>
    <li> Does what it needs to do. I&#x27;ve had mine for quite a while and although it&#x27;s not as sharp a cut as originally, it&#x27;s still good for quick edging</li>
    <li> Exellent machine. I cuts in seconds to almost shave like finish. Even beard and mustache.</li>
    <li> Only use these to line and trim beard and mustache.  Sofar they have performed extremely well.</li>
    <li> These are my second set of andis trimmers that I have purchased. Great hair trimmers and good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> on time... I get the same and with the same description... very good i like that very much. please keep it up</li>
    <li> I got this because someone I knew used it and he always has a clean shaven look. It gives the &#x27;one day&#x27; appearance which I like and my skin appreciates it versus a blade because my skin gets sensitive. I recommend this to anyone wanting to get away from expensive blades and needs a near-close shave. Transaction went smoothly.</li>
    <li> Perfect product. Had it for over 2 years and still going strong. Would recommend this to anyone. Saved me alot of money.</li>
    <li> I do hairlines and beards they come out nice and sharp and thats before i use a streight edge blade</li>
    <li> I was tired of going through cheaper brand name trimmers so I elected to spend a little more on this.  So far it has been a great trimmer...</li>
    <li> This clipper provides sharp edging and is easy to handle.  It gets around all the edges and removes hair cleanly without snags.</li>
    <li> They work ok but dont execpt to start cutting like a Pro you still need some background it cutting hair.&lt;br /&gt;but they get the job done</li>
    <li> great product very glad I bought it. brand new product and was a few dollars cheaper than the store product.</li>
    <li> it works very well and it&#x27;s reliable. it doesn&#x27;t make noise and it&#x27;s easy to use. i like it alot</li>
    <li> This is the greatest, clean cut lines for that trim clean look. Use it between cuts. Should have bought this years ago.</li>
    <li> Wow, this feels as smooth as a razor. I never knew that I could ever get such a close shave without bumps until I began using this trimmer. I am now also able to line my hair with accuracy as well.</li>
    <li> As a barber ,12 yrs now , been using this about 8 yrs. had a similar product before but it cant compare to the Andis T-outliner .&lt;br /&gt;Cuts really close almost like a razor but not quite . I use them in Razor fades .This outliner fades so clean u dont know where was shaved or where the outliner  began . This is not for long hair . Use a regular clipper to shorten hair then line with these .Keep the blades clean and well lubricated with the supplied oil , this extends the life .&lt;br /&gt;Usually lasts me about 5 months before i change the blades . I work 6 days per week and with the number of guys its used on, thats normal for me .This is a Great liner or dry shaver for people who get razor bumps or who have sensitive skin .&lt;br /&gt;4 Stars cause it binds up quickly and needs to be cleaned before  normal power returns .</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Thanks! Works perfectly. I used a straight razor before and I used to get horrible bumps. Now my skin is a smooth as if I were a baby again.</li>
    <li> bought it for my brother as a birthday gift and it works like a charm for him. does the job and is definitely worth it for edging/lining up.</li>
    <li> Purchase this item, it came with alot of a hair and the blade was damage.</li>
    <li> I have used so many others but these have been the best!</li>
    <li> stop working after 5 week and i use the Trimmer twice im out of 47.00 dollars better luck next time</li>
    <li> I have been around Andis products for most of my life.&lt;br /&gt;And I upgraded to this product due to where I was at and finally being around a place that sold Andis. I was disappointed because they broke barely 3 months down the line.&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed in how they quickly stopped cutting, heat problems, and running into other blade issues , that Ive never had before with other hair clippers and Andis products in the past.</li>
    <li> This is actually my second pair of these. They are by far the best quality clippers out and for the price you can&#x27;t lose. Win Win</li>
    <li> brand new item out of the box, excellent price, love it</li>
    <li> Closest shave ever...&lt;br /&gt;Hint: don&#x27;t drop it, the blade will go out of adjustment.&lt;br /&gt;You can get it services at personal edge for $10</li>
    <li> Solid, just like your barber&#x27;s. Makes super quick work of sideburns, mustache, beard, or anything else. With no guard, it leaves behind bare skin, but it&#x27;s not as close as a razor will get. With a guard, it&#x27;s a great beard/sideburn trimmer. This is a much more solid piece of kit than the clippers you will find at the drugstore. It&#x27;s corded, but the cord is long.</li>
    <li> Great for dry shaving.  No irritation or razor burn and gets close to the skin so that only a slight \\&quot;shadow\\&quot; is left.  Highly recommend for those with sensitive skin for shaving.</li>
    <li> Great product and great shipping. I use this to shave my facial hair. It does a really good job at it. I&#x27;ve had this for 2 years now and it&#x27;s still working. You just have to oil it and clean it reglarly for it to be optimum.</li>
    <li> The blade wasn&#x27;t  really sharpe and from time to time it stops working til I bang it on the counter.</li>
    <li> The best clipper for a Man who has sensitive skin. i have been using Whal and several others for years and I have to say that this clipper outshines them 2:1. Great buy, of high quality and my Girls all complimented on the close shave.</li>
    <li> The precision isnt that great. I was expecting better quality in terms of outlining, doesnt really get the close shave i was hoping it wld provide...not horrible, definitely not great.</li>
    <li> These are some great trimmer they cut very precise.  My husband use them to shave and to line my son&#x27;s hair and his hair.  Also the price was really good.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is excellent. It&#x27;s small and portable and works very well. It&#x27;s worth buying. I allows me to do my trimming.</li>
    <li> I used so many trimmers before and none is comparable to this one.Very accurate and powerful product.I love it.And beside it is light.</li>
    <li> It does get very hot.  But it cuts like a dream.  I would suggest this trimmer to someone who is capable of tkaing care of a product.  In otherwords, if you do not want to wipe the excess hair, clean, and oil the cutter after each use, then you&#x27;re best bet is to keep getting a shape up from a barber.</li>
    <li> They cut close without having to press so hard.  The GTX liners don&#x27;t cut close at all!  These are what you need in a outliner clipper.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Its working amazing i really like it</li>
    <li> This is a high quality trimmer that cuts close to your skin without getting nicked....I have seen some of the barber shops use it where I get my hair cut and that is why I purchased it</li>
    <li> I gave it 5 start its exactly like the picture said.</li>
    <li> Great trimmers for those who dont like to shave but need a close trim.</li>
    <li> Easily cuts through thick scruff that has defeated many an expensive trimmer/electric shaver before it. I&#x27;m looking at you Wahl and Braun.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut as close as I hoped. Apparently, it needs to be zero gapped. Should have came that way... Hurts to use.</li>
    <li> Exactly what we were looking for</li>
    <li> great deal. I&#x27;ve been using this for 5 years now.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Andis is a great product and the T-Outliner is no exception</li>
    <li> used once and next time top end of clipper metal rusting other than that product would be awesome.</li>
    <li> I have waited a long time to say this about a trimmer and now I can. This Andis Professional 04710 T-Outline Personal Trimmer is the best trimmer I have ever owned. It is awesome, does an outstanding job. I Highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> i ordered a trimmer from you guys and the picture is the one I wanted,upon receiving the trimmer it was the wrong one,i have no use for the one I was sent so there for it is money lost :( I guess I no not to order online anymore you see one thing order it and get something else....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all about effieciency and savings with me. I love going to the barbershop, but not to the tune of 15-25 bucks every two weeks, sometimes weekly to maintain beard and outline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I invested in this shaver to keep my lines clean and to maintain my look longer without having to run to the shop as much. I am not a barber, but I do know how to maintain and edge myself up - with practice in my teenage years, so I recommend if you&#x27;re not confident in keeping your lines in check for your goatee or beard, leave it to the professionals - but this trimmer really does the job for me. This trimmer practically paid for itself in just a few short weeks!</li>
    <li> If using in North America, then 5 stars as it really will meet all trimming and dry shaving needs. However, I travel a lot and this does not work outside North America. The appropriate travel adapter for this costs an additional $150! Fail to understand why in this day and age why such grooming products do not come with a universal adapter for travel.</li>
    <li> awesome for neck lines and line ups</li>
    <li> Loving this after a few months of use. I use it to shave my head and it gets real close to my scalp, almost as much as a regular razor. I&#x27;ve kept it oiled before and after use and cleaned it after every use and the blades are just as sharp as the first time I used it. It does not get too hot in my hand as others have said. I would recommend to anyone looking for a close shave without using a razor and shaving cream!</li>
    <li> Great product for at home grooming..</li>
    <li> Some of the best clippers I have ever used. I tried shaping up with other cheap clippers for my children but they didn&#x27;t work. My barber brothers use these as well. They get a bit hot after while but it is not unbearable.</li>
    <li> Hands down this is the best liner in the business. Every barbershop I ever been in, this is what barbers are using to give you a crisp line</li>
    <li> Had these for about a year and use them exclusively on my face. I wanted to stop using razors because my skin was reacting poorly. These have been a great solution. It gets close enough to appear that I&#x27;ve shaved. It&#x27;s comfortable to use, and isn&#x27;t too loud. Stays cool enough for my purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be sure to squirt some of the included oil on the blades now and then. For me over the coarse of half a dozen shaves the blades start to cut less well, because presumably some stubble has worked it&#x27;s way between the clippers and is jamming them up. Simply squirt some oil on the cutting parts (no need to disassemble), turn it on, and the oil will work its way between the blades to clear up the jam. Wipe away the excess and 30 seconds later they&#x27;re as good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also make a note about the cord. It&#x27;s high quality, it doesn&#x27;t come with a bunch of kinks in it, and hangs nicely. Very cooperative. It&#x27;s the little things like that, that make all the difference. :)</li>
    <li> Great Clippers my husband who is a Barber for over 20-years uses Andis Clippers.  The price was really good here and so much cheaper than going to someplace like Sally&#x27;s Beauty.</li>
    <li> This product is very good.It cuts closely and cause no irritation. I am very satisfied and would recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and accurate. I should have done a little more research and I would have found one like the wahl t trimmer than can accept guards to trim an actual beard. Very satisfied with how this works and feels solid.</li>
    <li> LIKE  the product and it does cut quite well. couldnt be any happier&lt;br /&gt;small, compact, and strong.&lt;br /&gt;strong little motor.</li>
    <li> Worth the money. This clipper cuts almost as close as a razor.  I used to spend around 35$ for my gillette replacement blades every so often but this has severely cut back on that expenditure. I get a nice clean cut that&#x27;s super accurate.  It also came in the box with complete instructions and oil to lube the blade after cuts. Very satisified.</li>
    <li> Ive used it a couple time since i bought it, im surprised at how cool it is and doesn&#x27;t scrape my soft skin. would have gotten 5 stars but its quite noisey more than the others, maybe that&#x27;s me doing something wrong tho or just need to sponge it like my brother said.</li>
    <li> Trimmer works well, but so did my last one that I had until it broke. I hope this one lasts longer (same model) but as long as it is working it cuts and excellent line and is pain free even when edging my son&#x27;s hairline.</li>
    <li> Broke after a while, didn&#x27;t cut all that well, hefty big......not all that great, finally tossed it in the recycle bin. waste of money.</li>
    <li> I like the wide blade, shaving my head and face goes a bit quicker than it used to.  This trimmer goes pretty low.  Not quite bald, but good enough for my liking.</li>
    <li> The best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned. I zero gapped it. I get nice clean lines when I do my shape up. I&#x27;ve had it for a month and have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Partner has used this product for years, it breaks very easily though becareful!!</li>
    <li> Pure Awesomeness, now I and my son can look fresh with all freshness..hahaha..so blessed with these. appreciate everything</li>
    <li> Ordered this and edge up my husband&#x27;s hair with this. It&#x27;s been 2 years and i barely had to purchase another blade. But that&#x27;s cuz my dog dropped it. Have you&#x27;re own barbershop at home .</li>
    <li> Tried this. It&#x27;s perfect. Nice long cord. Not a hassle at all to plug in and use. This is extremely well made. It will last up to professional barber use. For home use it will last forever. The head is perfect for trimming mustaches.</li>
    <li> I owned these clippers previously and they eventually broke.  Bought the same replacement pair. Much cheaper on amazon and I didn&#x27;t even have to leave the house. They are great clippers for the value.</li>
    <li> Great item... came highly recommended. Been using them for a few weeks now and love them. Gonna adjust blade to those barber specs and it&#x27;ll be perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just starting to cut my own hair and after much researching I decided to go with Andis T Outliners to shape myself up. These clippers are very sharp and I didn&#x27;t realize I cut myself until I was done, I kept cutting in the same area until it was perfect however it left a scar on my forehead after it healed. My advice is to cut with light pressure and slowly</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several pairs of trimmers over the years and none cut as close as these (without removing skin). The build seems to be fairly rugged and I&#x27;ve had no issues with them all all.</li>
    <li> Always a good buy for these, but after so many years they should use better blade metal so it&#x27;s impervious to rusting.</li>
    <li> Wonderful set of clippers-&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> trims and lines my beard&lt;br /&gt;never again will i buy cheap dollar store trimmers&lt;br /&gt;use what the pros use. all barbers have these so i decided to get my own</li>
    <li> I am no expert when it comes to trimmers, however,  I have gone through a few over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually would purchase the cheaper ones found in Walgreens or other place, but this time I decided to get one that would actually last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase. This item is built to last and cuts perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people might be annoyed by the cord and might prefer a wireless option, but I am perfectly fine with the cord and am very satisfied with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> 5 Star product!  Exactly what I was looking for.  Love Andis products and this item does not disappoint at all!</li>
    <li> My husband initially purchased one of these items over 20 years ago, and it finally gave out on him.  He would not settle for anything else so I was so happy to find a replacement on Amazon.  He gave all his others to our son, since he found out he got this replacement.  Definitely a great purchase, and you no doubt get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> Love love love best investment ever....</li>
    <li> Use these clippers to line up my hair line. They work as there suppose to, I&#x27;m satisfied. Great quality as expected.</li>
    <li> My package was opened and used, there was hair all over the blades.</li>
    <li> I wore out my previous T-Blade and replaced it with the exact model</li>
    <li> I use this to trim my husband&#x27;s hair.  Works well.  It does not have a battery and it must be kept plugged in to use.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my hubby he loves them, He looks so sexy when he uses them for a line up!</li>
    <li> Great machine cuts close and will not cause cuts to skin,easY to use</li>
    <li> Outstanding. I use it for shaving and it gives me a really close shave. An excellent investment. Xx xx xx xx</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve ever been to a barbershop in the United States, chances one, if not all, of the barbers have an Andis T-outliner.  I bought this for home use to cut my kids hair and save on haircut costs.  Along with the Oster Classic 76, the Andis T-outliner is one part of a perfect pair.</li>
    <li> My only regret is not purchasing one sooner. I recommend one of these to anyone who does not enjoy shaving with a blade.</li>
    <li> i received this item  the box  was  open,  and i still gave it a chance when i turned it on  it got extremely hot to handle within 5 minutes  i could not hold it in my hand let alone do a  fading on a kids hair. I  am so disappointed i purchased the Andis T-Outliner Trimmer because i cut hair for  underprivileged KIDS  and for them to send me a defective item its not OK ,&lt;br /&gt;i would not recommend  this item at all. and will be returning , and on top of that i did not get an invoice .&lt;br /&gt;now i know that those  5  to 4 star reviews are false adverts .</li>
    <li> This shaves and outlines much cleaner than my previous shaver, i&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have to worry about the hair pulling and skin irritation of a dull shaver.</li>
    <li> Ive been a barber since 1998. I&#x27;ve owned two sets of these T- Outliners. The first lasted 10 years... LITERALLY and were stolen. My set now is on its fourth year. You ppl rating one star and saying they are dull are truly showing your lack of knowledge. The promate blade that fits these are PRE-SET... If you need a pre set then you&#x27;ll have to order that separately. These aren&#x27;t factory set for the razor edge finish. I assure you however with the adjustment of the blade after loosening the screws and pushing the scissor blade to the edge of the cross blade, it will cut as close as needed if not closer lol. Only flaw this clipper has is how hot it gets. But a simple spray of kool lube will fix that as well.</li>
    <li> I decided to get this product after it was suggested to be by a friend. I don&#x27;t like razor shaving cause that is when i get the most ingrown hairs but I also do like to use an electric shaver cause it irritates my sensitive beautiful manly chocolate skin of mine. So then I got this phillips electric razor that allows you to shave with shaving cream and it worked great. But i noticed if i let my hair grow out a lil to long before shaving with it it would miss a couple of strands on my face and i&#x27;ll end up tweezing them which takes a while. So i decided to get something that will cut the hair short enough for me to use my phillips shaver. But what i didn&#x27;t know is that this clipper would work so well that after i finish trying just to trim the hairs on my face it would cut them off pretty close. So now i use it to shave all the time unless i need a super smooth baby bottom shave then i do the combination of the two. Oh and i don&#x27;t got to the barber and spend 20 bucks for a hair cut. I cut my own hair with some Andis clippers i got at walmart (it had a black guy on the box so i figured it would work) and they work. And i use these T-liners for my lining and it works great. And it&#x27;s quieter than other clippers i used too. I highly recommend them to someone who either wants to shave with them or use them as a liner.</li>
    <li> This is what the barbershops use. These are the most official that any man could have. Bought this as a gift and they truly enjoy this.</li>
    <li> Love these clippers only problem i have is that they get very hot quick</li>
    <li> Prior to getting this Trimmer, i  had tried a variety of different shaving brands and methods but none would ever give me the close shave feeling or if they did, i would end up with shave bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this unit in 2010, shave at least 3 times a week with it and it still works flawlessly. Never had to readjust the blades or have them replaced and it is now the end of 2012. All i had to do to keep it in top shape was keep the blades oiled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a product i will definitely recommend</li>
    <li> The T-shaped andis hair trimmer is an excellent tool for creating precise hair lining, there is nothing I disliked about the product, if you are a beginning barber like I am I would recommend this item to you.</li>
    <li> Oil the blades and this is a perfect trimmer.  I bought the guards as well and they work great.  I actually use it on my whole head since I have a buzz cut.  It does get hot after my beard and head and all, but that&#x27;s probably 15 minutes straight.</li>
    <li> Mine didn&#x27;t seem new out of the box</li>
    <li> Great trimmer, not as close as a razor, but almost.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really use razors to shave my head as I always get razor burns and bumps. This trimmer gets me an incredibly close shave, and is also excellent for shaping my beard. My only complaint is that it can get somewhat hot with use.</li>
    <li> 06/09/2015 - My original review was written for a pair of these that I purchased for my son.  I was personally using the Andis T-Edger, which I have used for numerous years.  I never tried my son&#x27;s T-Outliners but he eventually switched to a conventional razor due to military restrictions.  However, even when he had the T-Outliner, he never seemed particularly enthusiastic about them.  When I tried mine for the first time, I saw why.  They cut okay but definitely nowhere as close or powerful a shave as the T-Edger.  These run quiet and smooth and cut so-so but don&#x27;t quite get that skin close feel.  The T-Edgers are louder, feel more powerful and seem to cut better. In fact, I switched from this brand new Outliner to the seven-year-old Edger it was supposed to replace during the very first cut.  Even at seven-years old, the Edger still seemed to cut better.  Maybe it&#x27;s personal preference but if you&#x27;re on the fence over the Outliner or Edger for facial shaving and head balding, I definitely give my nod to the Edger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son and I cannot use conventional manual or disposable razors due to razor bumps.  Electric razors, especially the rotary type like Norelco, are just as bad.  When we want a skin-close shave without bumps or irritation, nothing beats a good set of Andis edgers or outliners.  I bought this set for my son and they work great.  He even uses them for shaving before his monthly Army drills, so that should tell you how close they shave.  You will get a shave just as close as a blade without going under the skin and inducing the growth of bumps.  That doesn&#x27;t mean bumps aren&#x27;t possible.  You can still get bumps if you don&#x27;t clean, sterilize and lube the blades after each use.  This inhibits the growth of germs and bacteria and keeps the blades sharp and smooth so they don&#x27;t develop microscopic pits that snag hairs and cause bumps and irritations.  Also, remember to always shave with the grain.  Shaving against it will produce bumps, even with clippers like these.ers like these.</li>
    <li> My wife is a stylist and has used many trimmers and this is her favorite.  It cuts nearly as close as a razor, no pulling.  It is a little more bulky than others but I will take function over form any day.</li>
    <li> I love these! They don&#x27;t cut as sharply as I anticipated, but still a great buy.</li>
    <li> Motor of Trimmer has begun to run very slow after two uses. Very disappointed with item &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> The casing was cracked and they started pulling in the hair after 3 weeks of use. This is very frustrating when I am having to oil my clippers twice per client.</li>
    <li> Disappointed! It does NOT shave close enough as is advertised. Saw this advertised on Steve Harvey&#x27;s show and was thrilled to use this product. Ohhh yeah! However, when it arrived, it didn&#x27;t do the trick as I had anticipated; it doesn&#x27;t shave closely at all. Frankly, it is irritating if one attempts to shave closely; dam. Will I keep it? Yes, because it is probably the BEST in its class, however, not working for me as was advertised by Steve Harvey or as per others who ranked this product. NOT happy at all!</li>
    <li> All this is great. Every colored man should have a pair.</li>
    <li> Works great. Good product</li>
    <li> Just starting out in learning how to cut hair and have always wanted to use a pair of these. Overall the trimmers are great. They give a sharp clean line as expected. only con would be that they heat up very quickly. Would definitely recommend using Cool Care or another coolant anytime you use this.</li>
    <li> still workin like a champ after 2 years of personal use</li>
    <li> Great product.  Just what they use at the Barber.  Price was also good.  Most beauty supply house want at least 15-20 more for it.  Great present for  men who use a trimmer.</li>
    <li> Needs extensive maintenance an must keep very clean. Also a little loud</li>
    <li> Went through two pairs that had a manufacturer&#x27;s defect that caused them to be EXTREMELY loud. Worked with amazon and got them both refunded, so no real complaints.</li>
    <li> Great for multiple uses in a week. With proper cleaning this can probably last a long tim (my previous one did). Great for dry shaving as well!</li>
    <li> great no problems!!!!!</li>
    <li> These trimmers are amazing. My wife is a barber by trade and stands by these.  She loves how close they cut.  The motor is strong</li>
    <li> I bought this machine considering all the great reviews it received trough the years. After patiently waiting for this baby to arrive. What do you know?&lt;br /&gt;The machine is broken. It does not cut and it is making a loud rattling noise. After opening the machine to adjust the blade and tighten the screws inside and out.&lt;br /&gt;It stayed the same. I spent money on the t outliner just to spend more money to fix something that should be working fine. This is not what I expected from Andis.&lt;br /&gt;This is the last time I purchase something from this brand.</li>
    <li> My husband looked all over for a trimmer that he could plug in, just like at the salons.  He did not want anything that used batteries or had to be recharged.  This stays in the drawer until needed and then goes right back...no clutter on the counter!</li>
    <li> These trimmers are exactly what I was looking for. They are high powered and well worth your money. NO regrets.</li>
    <li> This clipper works like a charm. I use it to shave as I have skin irritation with a razor. This is a must have.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t hold up like style linners. I hate these, will never buy again</li>
    <li> These clippers are great bargain for the price. I get clean, sharp lines like i do at the barber shop.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my husband and two days after purchasing the T liners they burned out. Not very happy with this purchase at all.</li>
    <li> This little guy works great! I should say that this is the first trimmer I&#x27;ve ever bought but I can&#x27;t imagine a nicer cut. When this one ever dies, I&#x27;ll be buying another one. I&#x27;ve had it for about a year now and it shows no signs of fatigue.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t need to look for any other edgers because this is the perfect product. Just make sure you keep it clean</li>
    <li> I like these. I have a problem where my face breaks out if I use a razor or face shaver. I bought this and use it on my face biweekly. It works great and instantly gives that five o&#x27;clock shadow look which girls love. The cord is plenty long and really flexible. The trimmer even has a hook so you can hang it on something if you want to feel like you are at the salon. As far as trimming goes it is very precise; I use it on my sideburns and it trims like a champ.</li>
    <li> The product is very nice but makes a lot of noise when used with a step-up transformer to 240V. It will be nice if we can get the 220-240V version.</li>
    <li> My husband wanted a new trimmer, and he loves this one. Beats the cheap-o one he got in the local store, and it cuts close and clean like his old trimmer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with breaking out after shaving with a traditional razor and even on some electric razors. I&#x27;ve often just used the &amp;#34;sideburn&amp;#34; cutter for my whole face but they never hold up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing however is a beast. I get the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had sans traditional razor and have yet to have a breakout from it. The blade hasn&#x27;t dulled at all and the motor works as well as the day I bought it which was just about a year ago. On top of that the cast metal exterior gives it a nice solid feel. I&#x27;m pretty sure if I dropped this that the sink counter would be in greater danger of breaking than the razor. I would highly recommend to anyone needing a shave.</li>
    <li> Great Product love it get the job done it really professional i might buy another one for my friend. I gave a clean shave and you can line your  self up.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is great for outlining sideburns and making the perfect goatee but its not too great for the 5 oclock shadow look because it trims way to close to the skin. Worth the price though.</li>
    <li> Great trimmers! They give you a sharp crisp line up. The closest thing to using a straight edge razor. Great product</li>
    <li> Love it ... I use this exclusively for dry shaving my face.  I like to have a five o&#x27;clock shadow look and these clippers deliver that look like no shaver can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharp blades and strong motor deliver a perfect cut every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews said that plastic housing gets with use. I have not experienced that.</li>
    <li> At first I thought I hit the jackpot with this item. It shaved my head almost as close as a razor and I was thrilled. But after less than two months, only about eight uses, something went very wrong. It was insanely painful and felt like it was ripping the hair from my head while barely even working to shave my hair. I called Andis and they told me that I could send it in, paying for the shipping myself, and they would take a look at it. They said this process could take a few weeks so someone like me who shaves his head frequently would be out of luck. When I pointed out that the product should not be defective after less than two months they said &amp;#34;it happens sometimes.&amp;#34; I pointed out that if it happens they should send me a new shaver immediately and that I would send mine back. They said that&#x27;s not how their refund process works.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my son and he loves his new trimmer. He said that they work very well.</li>
    <li> Great product quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had mine for over 4 years and they still work like new, of course with proper care and maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Offers a super close cut, almost like using an actual razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for cutting really sharp and close hair lines.</li>
    <li> I use this to shave my face. It doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a razor but it very gentle on my face.</li>
    <li> An exemplary product and performance is unmatched by other brands that claim to be professional quality...they aren&#x27;t even close..buy Andis.</li>
    <li> I was just complaining about theses clippers breaking to my girl. LOL now as I was on Amazon shopping for a new pair of clippers I seen these and Amazon informed me on the screen I purchased these in 2010 . That is not bad I thought I had them for about 2 years but 5 is pretty good and I cant say I took good care of these (SMH) rarely oiled them dropped them off my counter many times and they cut close up to the end. I don&#x27;t know which clipper I&#x27;m getting yet but it will be the same brand.</li>
    <li> Well made and cuts real close.  I use them for trimming my neck.  Works even better than I expected.  Real smooth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a workhorse, fantastic but heavy. Also the blade cracked when it fell but that&#x27;s more my fault rather than the make. Blades are easy to get and install. 0-gapped easy too. Cord is plenty long enough and the cut is sharp each time. Very happy.</li>
    <li> In the words of my husband - This is the second trimmer from Andis that my husband has. The older one was awesome but it&#x27;s been years since he has owned it. The new one has newer features but looks basically the same. It&#x27;s a great simple trimmer.</li>
    <li> Perfect clippers to get that hairline looking tight. No need for a barber when I can now do my own hair and beard!</li>
    <li> product came dull and could not adjust because screw was defective. Amazon was quick to replace and I got the outliner II but this product is not that great.</li>
    <li> Excellent line up and can be used for skin tight fading</li>
    <li> My partner uses them with every cut!</li>
    <li> product over heats fast but  fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Great clipper for balding or doing line ups. Very sharp so be careful when 1st using.</li>
    <li> Great clippers. I returned these ones and got the andis outline2 because i wanted a smaller blade length. i should have just kept these though because i have the t outliner blade on my clipper now anyway. this clipper and the outliner 2&#x27;s blades can be interchanged with eachother so whatever clipper you order you can order the other blade style and have 2 blades, which is nice. ive been using the same 2 blades for about 6 years now and they still cut good. clean and maintain and this clipper will last a long time. You can dry shave with it and get a pretty close cut if you know how to set the blades. Ive saved way more money that i would have spent on razorblades than i spent on this, so these things have paid for themselves over and over agian and still goin strong. Best clipper on the market for your money in my opinion. i use these only on myself and they will get hot after like 20 minutes so if your a barber or something you might want 2.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll give it two stars just because. Product arrived, great product reviews, completely unusable. I live on an overseas military base and apparently the power cycles are different than in America. Turn on the clipper and all they do is a death rattle at 120 dB. Not sending them back shipping anything to an overseas Fpo/apo takes forever. I&#x27;ll just wait until I move home in 2016 to use them.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer about two months ago and I absoultely love it. It gets a nice tight cut and has pretty much replaced my razor. I wear a thin chin strap and this gets all the right angles. Love it.</li>
    <li> Great set of clippers. Most professionals use these to give your haircut those sharp edges around your sideburns and to line up your neck. Awesome product. Buy &amp;#34;Cool Care Plus&amp;#34; spray, and use it before, during and after to extend the life of your blades, and keep them running great.</li>
    <li> Bought these as my barber swears by them. Gave them as a gift for my girlfriend who also cuts hair. She loves them as well.</li>
    <li> This t-outliner gives a crispy cut what I don&#x27;t like is that It gets very very hottttt I had to make ventilation holes to be less hot also one tooth broke from the cutting blade and I had to buy a replacement blade.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Does get hot tho</li>
    <li> Terrible product. I ordered this and when I first turned it on it was way too loud. It would make someone go deaf. I returned it and just got the new one in the mail and the new one had the same problem--way too loud. Avoid this product.</li>
    <li> Gets extremely hot to the touch, blade constantly misaligned...will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Would buy again great price.</li>
    <li> Great hair trimmer! My hair dresser recommended this for trimming hair around the edges, and it works very well. Easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> Exelent product. Thanks you</li>
    <li> When I first got these trimmers they were amazing. Now after only using them for two months they get super hot after 5 minutes of lining up and have now stopped cutting the hair. I&#x27;m going to try a new blade and see if that helps.</li>
    <li> Does a decent job.  Doesn&#x27;t really zero out hair.  Needs adjusting a lot.</li>
    <li> once you adjust the blade, it does a great job, make sure you know what you&#x27;re doing when you attempt to adjust them. Go to youtube, lots of good tutorials. One complaint, i have boys that like to wiggle and can&#x27;t sit still during haircuts. The prolonged time makes the trimmers heat up after a while.</li>
    <li> Passed the full body grooming test. These trimmers are supposed to be used just for your head, however they can be used safely on any part of your body....and I mean any. Gentle to skin.</li>
    <li> My husband love this.</li>
    <li> could cut closer watch out for labia/sack Bite.</li>
    <li> Excellent precision trimmer.</li>
    <li> Awesome and close for lining.</li>
    <li> Got this for my boyfriend. He says it works well. Gave it 4 stars only because he said he wished it came with attachments.</li>
    <li> I use this as a beard trimmer for my husband and I think it works very well. I still go over his face with a Philips Norelco 1150X/46 SensoTouch 2D Electric Razor which I also purchased on Amazon, but I use this when the hairs get too long. Also this product is made in the USA!!!</li>
    <li> good kn lkk  k  jjln  j j jkk  lj l  j j  j jjl  k  l  j  jl  jljj j</li>
    <li> After reading the many positive reviews, I purchased this as a gift for my boyfriend who has a gorgeous beard that he &amp;#34;manicures&amp;#34; himself, and needed a pair of really good trimmers.  He loves it!  I&#x27;m impressed at how quiet they are when he&#x27;s using them.</li>
    <li> product met my expectations..very good quality product and I received what I ordered. would recommend this product to others. works great!!</li>
    <li> This is a classic Barber Trimmer and you will see it in many shops. Works great for me with a close cut and a clean edge up. I use it for both edging and shaving beard as well as shaving my head for a very clean and close shave.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the purchase.  Recommend to any body who would listen!</li>
    <li> I got this trimmer after seeing it in a barbershop. It&#x27;s great for outlining the beard and for getting the 5&#x27;oclock shadow but I wish it came with attachments so that I can keep my beard neat and a little bit longer as this trimmer trims way to close to the skin.</li>
    <li> No up to my expectations I would have thought the would have trimmed better , not good on the hair outline at all just dont do what I thought they would.</li>
    <li> I really like thus trimmer. I have been through a lot of trimmers in my life, but not compared to this. It cuts super short !.</li>
    <li> Awesome if you want a super close shave as if you used a razor even for coarser hair. I trim my head and face. It&#x27;s looks like I shaved maybe 12 hours ago, so really good and solid. Doesn&#x27;t catch your hairs and make you scream :) If you have super sensitive skin like on your neck then just be gentle.</li>
    <li> Smooth close shaving without a single shaving stick makes this product excellent. If you want to shave without dreading the aftermaths of bumps all over you neck then you should buy this product.</li>
    <li> With Andis you know what you&#x27;re going to get everytime, a long lasting, well built set. These are a must have for any skill level.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know one barbershop that doesn&#x27;t use Andis. I really recommended everyone to buy it. Its worth the money.</li>
    <li> Best just like the barbershop product.. EXACTLY what the PROS use.. You wont be dissapointed in this product if you choose to purchase</li>
    <li> After owning this amazing product for 3 years now, i think i&#x27;m ready to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;these clippers are out of this world, never thought they would be cutting the way they are after 3 years,&lt;br /&gt;actually getting ready to order for me dad.&lt;br /&gt;i will recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> The best trimmer ever made. A must have for the home barber or professional.</li>
    <li> Came on time , nothing wrong , loving it !!</li>
    <li> Every time i buy one of these machines the blades are never sharpened they re so dull, i so tired of this</li>
    <li> If it gets to hot it will never run again after.</li>
    <li> It was what I expected</li>
    <li> Even though I am not a professional barber, I am a person who admires a well built, good designed, effective tool or piece of equipment and this trimmer fit that bill perfectly. I had heard they were the go to trimmer from afew barbers and I see why after their purchase and use.</li>
    <li> These trimmers are super skin close. I don&#x27;t shave like regular people, I have to dry shave, and this comes through</li>
    <li> Great deal and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Clippers are just what I was looking for and expecting to buy. Would send buy these again or recommend someone for them.</li>
    <li> The first trimmer sent was dead on arrival. The second pair worked, but I had to set the blades before they would cut worth anything. I am surprised. Andis usually puts out a quality product.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for to create  professional quality straight shape ups!</li>
    <li> My goto clippers to shave my face every 2 or 3 days. Razors break my face out. Have your barber lineup the blade to get you a closer shave with the clippers.</li>
    <li> This trimmer lasted for two months. Then, one day it just stopped cutting correctly.  I have tried taking it apart and re-adjusting and to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this trimmer to anyone desiring a long-lasting product.  It was great while it lasted but $50 for two months is a little too steep.  Not worth the trouble, definitely would steer clear and look for a better product.</li>
    <li> Very close cut.  Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I always get good thing to say about this trimmer over the many years I&#x27;ve been buying it. I must be on my 5th now ever since my wife gave it to me as a birthday gift. The last one I bought must be a used one or fake. I used it 3 times and it itches me like hell. I guess I will be looking for another brand.</li>
    <li> I hate the inconvenience of  going to the barbershop and some of the nonsense that gets discussed there which is why I love my quality Andis products which enable me to do self barbering. There is a learning curve to it though so be patient for a little while and if you need some guidance there are plenty of videos on YouTube to show you the way.</li>
    <li> I just got it yesterday and tried it.&lt;br /&gt;I used it to outline my beard and like it so far, my only concern is that it heats up pretty fast (within 5 mins).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If someone is trying to do a fade or taking their time - in 10-15 mins of use I&#x27;m not sure how hot it will get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just something to think about. I only use it for getting my line ups right and outlining and shaping (which is what it&#x27;s supposed to be used for). In that case it s hould be good as I only need it for 5-10 mins (15 max).</li>
    <li> Bought these years ago and they&#x27;re still running flawlessly! Great product!</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome. I have really thick facial hair and this takes it off no problem. I have $300 electric razors that dont work as well as this $50 clipper.</li>
    <li> Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;very good set last a long time?</li>
    <li> This is awesome. Easy to trim facial hair and make clean cut edges. The blades are sharp. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Just as expected after doing homework/review.</li>
    <li> Very sharp for doing great edges/tapes. Be careful around the neck, and sensitive areas because they with cut you a little with the sharpness!!</li>
    <li> Excellent!! From cancun city, Mexico</li>
    <li> I have tried other trimmers but this is just the right tool.  I had tried my sons.  He uses it for that day old shave look.</li>
    <li> Works very well! No complaints! It cuts close, without nicks and is clean..I have had no razor bumps or issues.</li>
    <li> Clipper works great. Great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Very happy hubby. He cuts his own hair (that is what is left of it) as close as he can get it. Powerful and easy to use.</li>
    <li> almost as close as a razor.</li>
    <li> I have always used the Andis T-Outliner and T-Edger with no problem.  This one was purchased as a gift and I do not think that they have had any problem out of this product.  Cannot go wrong with them.</li>
    <li> It does heat up if you run it too long, but I couldn&#x27;t live without this trimmer.  It cuts perfectly, and it saves me a lot of $$$ by not having to go to the barber to get my neck lined up between haircuts.</li>
    <li> All barbers have at least one pair of these. Great!!!</li>
    <li> You already know what the T-Outliner is all about.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Best shaver/trimmer hands down. I&#x27;ve owned countless consumer-grade norelcos, brauns, and the like up to the $50 range and this one blows them all away and then some. I have incredibly thick and curly beard that most over the counter shavers will not cut adequately, leaving half-cut hair all over my face even after numerous passes on my face. This shaver cuts everything well and only need a few passes.&lt;br /&gt;I recently owner the corded Wahl mini (red cover) trimmer which comes close in shave and quality. The Wahl however has longer teeth which can cut your face easily if you are not careful. The andis has small teeth and I&#x27;ve had no cuts after two months of use. I oil it up after every use and it works as new. It does get warm in your hand. as others have stated but will not affect ur shave. If you need different lengths, then you need to buy the clips separately, but again it&#x27;s worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy these forever as long as they make them.</li>
    <li> The Andis T-Outliner Trimmer are exactly what I expected. They are great for my everyday grooming. I would highly recommended them to family and friends. This is a great gift for the holidays.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work properly and the blades were old and dull.</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;m a 22 year old African American man and like most suffered from in grown hairs. I tried different technics to stop the bumps from coming but never found a shaver that did the job. Now I think I might have my face bumps up sometimes it&#x27;s like if I don&#x27;t keep it cut then here come the bumps. So I purchased this shaver and I just received it yesterday 10-10-14 and I used it I just can&#x27;t say how great it is yet but my skin feels good also these are the clippers that my barber use when he shave my face so that&#x27;s also why I decided to give them a try because every time I tried to shave on my own with different shavers I would bump up and I know I have sensitive skin. So I know what it takes to get rid of my bumps I just let the facial hair grow over the bumps like 2 or three weeks with out shaving then I shave and my face is back smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. So I hope this was a little helpful I will update again in like two more weeks</li>
    <li> Just using it for dry shaving.  Works perfectly and not loud at all which is a plus.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for my husband</li>
    <li> I had an old one that I had been using for years and was scared to get rid of it.  I replaced it with a new and remembered why I never want to part with it.  Gives a super close trim and is quiet as a church mouse!</li>
    <li> Stopped working after a few months.</li>
    <li> Never got this but love liners</li>
    <li> These clippers are great for a bald guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bit the bullet and shaved my head,  I don&#x27;t really like the maintenance of using a razor every day or 2 so these fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;You can dial these clippers down to 00 with a screw driver and then they cut really close.  I read some reviews here that said they were like a razor, I don&#x27;t know what kind of razor they are using but thats an exaggeration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do however love these clippers, you can get really close and no Knicks or cuts.  I have had many other clippers and these are by far the best.  I had the peanut and it was good until it died, but these Andis clippers have much more power and a wider clipping blade that makes short work of shaving my head.  They also cut much closer, not razor close but much closer that any others I have tried.</li>
    <li> Arrive rusty. Did not appear to have any multi-setting options.</li>
    <li> Avesome! Thanks a lot! Super Great Seller! Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> This is awesome!  Super close shave... I use it as a body hair shaver and its the best thing out there.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on a worthless battery powered shaver.  Go with the Andis and stay smooth, my friends.</li>
    <li> Works Great Between Barber and Shaving. Real Close Minus the Shaving Bumps For Those With Sensitive Skin.</li>
    <li> Very good clippers.  I&#x27;ve had mine almost 3 years now and they&#x27;re great for shaving and edge ups.</li>
    <li> This did not work for my husband&#x27;s fine hair.  It felt like it was pulled one hair at a time.</li>
    <li> loud! and vibrates like crazy! cuts good but would not buy again</li>
    <li> something was wrong with these clippers, made a really loud horrible sound, even after attempting to adjust them.</li>
    <li> ORDER PLACED&lt;br /&gt;April 5, 2011&lt;br /&gt;pretty solid. i&#x27;ve had mine for over 2 years if not longer. Just keep it clean and oiled up and it keeps going and going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;update march 16-2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;still working like new. keep it lubed up and tighten screws every 6 months and cleaned up. cant beat it.</li>
    <li> This is a excellent product, They shipped by the time that they said,&lt;br /&gt;excellent quality,  i will definitely recommend this item!!!!</li>
    <li> Great clippers love them. Always used Andes but these have been my favorite clippers by far. Wouldn&#x27;t use a different brand. Great deal. Thanks again</li>
    <li> These are simply the best edging clippers out there.  I&#x27;m not able to use a razor on my face no matter which method I try and this gives me the best shave without my face breaking out.  Arrived on time brand new in the box.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my son - He loves this brand of liners. He uses them almost everyday, even cuts his son&#x27;s hair too. great product.</li>
    <li> Its been almost a year that I have been using this outliner, mostly in conjunction with my Oster Classic 76 hair clipper and it works very well. I keep a beard, about a size 2 in length and I use this outliner to straighten up my mustache and beard, trim along my ears and straighten up the back and sides. It is very precise, does not run as hot as most folk would suggest, unless if you are an actual barber and use it all day long. I use it at least once a week and keep the blade oiled after each use. Have not made any adjustments since taking it out of the box as I have not found that necessary. It cuts pretty close out of the box but not Mach 3 close, I prefer it this way, in case I make any mistakes. Bought this and the Oster Classic 76 to become recession proof as bi-weekly hair cuts got too expensive. I do not regret my decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars given out of 5 as it is a good product and it has served its purpose well. Nothing about it is outstanding, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nabil</li>
    <li> Buy this item in april-08-2009 and work perfect. 3 year of use not problem, for me&lt;br /&gt;this product is 100% recomend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a city kid just tryin to keep it fresh, it ends up takin a toll on my wallet . whenever I can save money I do. Goin to the barbershop is a hassle, I&#x27;m in college and it&#x27;s just an inconvenience goin to the barbershop once a week. I end up waiting and wasting hours for a shape up and wasting way to much money on something that seems simple to do. It really isn&#x27;t that hard to do your own shape up comin from the guy who can barely draw a straight line and who&#x27;s handwriting looks like a six year old. Trust me . Buy this product . You won&#x27;t regret it. I use it in between hair cuts and now only go to the barbershop once a month. The product will pay for itself quickly if you use it enough. Make sure you oil it and sterilize it properly to avoid skin irritation.</li>
    <li> FOR BARBERING IT DOES THE JOB. BETTER THAN THE WAHL PEANUT OR OSTER OUTLINER. IT DOES THE JOB.&lt;br /&gt;SHARP BOXES AND OULINES. I PERSONALLY DO NOT USE IT FOR SHAVING BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT IS NOT MEANT FOR SHAVING.&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AN \\&quot;OUTLINER\\&quot; AS ITS ORIGINAL NAME, IT DOES THE JOB 5 STARS</li>
    <li> The Andis Professional Trimmers are great, had them for a month so far and no problems with everyday use. Great value</li>
    <li> I had to return these Trimmers back to the Manufacture because the ones that I received overheated the very first time I used them, but they did change them out for me without any charge.</li>
    <li> i feel like i&#x27;m going to get cut when i use this product.  it makes this noise and you have to be really careful and shave lightly.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a while back hoping that I would not have to buy another one. So far everything is going according to plan. I use this t-liner regularly and I still get the same spot on finish. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Had to replace my blade because the previous one fell and broke. Ordered a replacement and I&#x27;m in love with it, it&#x27;s sharp and cuts like magic.</li>
    <li> This item started off strong. Seemed very quality like. After a few months use, boyfriend said it didn&#x27;t cut as good as it use to when he first got it.</li>
    <li> These clippers put those 20.00 dollar clippers to shame. They are sharp and you don&#x27;t have to worry about charging. They allow you to trim with one pass instead of 8 with other clippers. These are professional grade and a great investment for those of us that cut hair at home. Don&#x27;t waste your money on any of those other clippers. Spend extra and get these. I have been using them to cut my husbands hair for three years now</li>
    <li> I just got these for christmas, ive been a hair stylist for about 7 years and these are hands down the best trimmers ive ever owned. I previously was using the Wahl peanut trimmers. The T-outliners are a little heavier so it took me a little while getting used to, but these get so close to the skin without kicking/cutting anyone. I would go as far to say that they get almost as close as a shaving razor. im in love with these and Andis has me as a customer from now on.</li>
    <li> Brought this for my husband because the old one he had stopped working. He loves it. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I was totally dissatisfied with the item, the trimmer came with rust on the blade.&lt;br /&gt;how bad can things get from there. I had to go and purchase another blade for the machine which was approximately half the price of the machine.</li>
    <li> My dad&#x27;s a barber, he likes this type of brand.</li>
    <li> I purchased this trimmer for facial hair, it does work well and blades has remained sharp, easy to use and store. would recommend, shipping was reasonable.</li>
    <li> Given that this was one of Amazon&#x27;s top results for beard trimmers, and it purported to do fades, I figured surely it would include a guard to adjust for different shave lengths.  I thought wrong.  This shaver has but one size, and as such I&#x27;m not sure what it would be good for unless you were a professional hair cutter, or you just wanted to shave your head.</li>
    <li> Not at all what I expected it gets supper hot like you cant even hold it and I only did an edge around my head. blade is dull have to cut each part three times nothing like how great the reviews said it would be!! don&#x27;t believe the hype this sucks I&#x27;m so pissed,thought I could do some cool designs.</li>
    <li> This trimmer came used and had hair in it.</li>
    <li> Much better than all of the drug store models I have had in the past.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my outlining and they cut really close so you don&#x27;t need many strokes, it&#x27;s a very good trimmer.</li>
    <li> I honestly expected better. Perhaps the blade needs adjustment and I will have to look into that. But as it came in the package, it&#x27;s rather unimpressive. Not the sharp trim-line I had expected.</li>
    <li> My husband bought these and everytime he uses them he comes out of the bathroom, all cocky, cause he loves the edge up it gives him and in return he thinks he&#x27;s Mr. Sexy afterwards. I do admit the edge up nicely.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with these trimmers</li>
    <li> My Andis LS finally quit after five years of use.  This model doesn&#x27;t trim as well as my old one, I have to make multiple passes over the same area to get the cut I want.</li>
    <li> My old clippers were getting hot quickly so I bought new blades. That didn&#x27;t help so I purchased a new one. Shipping was not a problem as it showed up on time.</li>
    <li> Great product purchase for my husband.  must go over the same area for a closest shave but what clippers do.  (men should just wax their face.&amp;#34;/)</li>
    <li> Absolutely excellent trimmer. Looking to shave your head [or use for whatever trimming needs you may have]? This is the one to get. This will trim you close...razor close [almost].</li>
    <li> Just as promised, Thank you.</li>
    <li> my husband uses this weekly for trimming sideburns and over-hear hair. i can use it to clean up the back of his haircut too.</li>
    <li> I was kinda disappointed in this item. It doesn&#x27;t trim as close as they mention. Still not a bad item though.</li>
    <li> Work as well as my old pair I purchased over 30 yrs. ago and went threw several thousands of heads of hair. If I would not have laid my old pair down and forgot where I left them I wouldn&#x27;t had to buy a new pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verl The Barber of Culver</li>
    <li> very poor quality for money would not recommend buying this product to anyone,i do not want to re-order another trimmer.</li>
    <li> Wonderful quality, cuts really well</li>
    <li> This is a good product....I use it to shave occasionally and it work just fine....I would recommend this to anyone looking to use this to shave..</li>
