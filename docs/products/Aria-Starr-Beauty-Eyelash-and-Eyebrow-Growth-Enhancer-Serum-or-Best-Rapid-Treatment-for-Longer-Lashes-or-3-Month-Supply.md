<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is not a mascara folks. It is a serum that you apply similar to eye liner. You only apply it to your upper eyelids and the product is virtually invisible. It is designed to help with hair growth. Other products that have you apply like mascara are pretty much a waste because they do not get into the hair follicles. This does get into the hair follicles.</li>
    <li> Just received this product. Got it for my sister. The product looks great though. It&#x27;s made from apples and has botanical complex tricholasty. The product is actually proven to increase eyelash thickness by 25% within 2 weeks! That&#x27;s amazing! This product is also NOT tested on animals so that&#x27;s also amazing. It does come in what looks like a tint box (trial size) however it does say that the product lasts approximately 3 months! You definitely can&#x27;t beat that for the price!</li>
    <li> love this would buy again</li>
    <li> So I jumped at the opportunity to try the Prolash Eyelash Growth serum at a reduced rate for my unbiased opinion. I have only been using for a few days now so at this moment I&#x27;m not going to speak of growth, I&#x27;m going to give the Prolash serum the full 6 weeks time they say you should give. This is the reason for my 4 star rating.  I will use the Prolash on my eyelashes not my brows like some have.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I thought it would have a harsh smell or be horrible to apply. NEITHER! It is super easy to apply. feels a little funny on my eyelids until it drys, but I love the application of it and the fact there is no horrid smell to it. I can&#x27;t wait to have some longer lashes!</li>
    <li> I started using this about two days ago.  I haven&#x27;t seen any marked difference but my eyebrows are laying down between and it gives them a more defined look especially after being arched. I would need to check back in after a couple of weeks to see if there is a real chang.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any growth after three days, but I compared the product ingredients to the one from Anastasia eyebrow serum and found that they were similar. Though I like this one more than the Anastasia one because it doesn&#x27;t waste product and is easy to apply.</li>
    <li> The wand is too small. This seems like a promotion size or maybe a sample. It works though.</li>
    <li> Enjoy product! Grateful for longer lashes!</li>
    <li> i think it&#x27;s really working. i&#x27;ve been using it about 2 weeks now and i am pretty sure i see a difference. it&#x27;s not dramatic, but i&#x27;m going to keep applying it and hope for more results. if i don&#x27;t get the desired results, i will update my review. i sometimes put on more than i&#x27;m supposed to and it gets in my eyes and burns for a few seconds, but it&#x27;s bareable, and it doesn&#x27;t happen unless i apply too much.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34; Good quality. I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and I am already seeing results! My lashes are already a good length but I was more exited about having them look fuller. I only apply to my top lashes and normally apply before bedtime, just once a day. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about three weeks.  I haven&#x27;t yet noticed a difference in thickness or color but my eyelashes are noticeably longer.  I&#x27;ll definitely continue using the serum and update my review in a few more weeks.  This serum is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.  The small brush makes it easy to get it where you want it and ensures you don&#x27;t waste any.  I&#x27;ll be back in a few weeks to let you know how it&#x27;s working!</li>
    <li> It is easy to use, but after 2 weeks I havent noticed any changes</li>
    <li> used for 3wks..did NOTHING..smart lash costs more but works for me..</li>
    <li> I am very susceptible to eye infections and have used different eyebrow and eyelash serums in the past which have all led to eye infections. But, hope springs eternal and so I tried this product only to get another eye infection with the first application. I am not saying anything bad about this product. It probably works very well but I am afraid to use it because of my sensitive eyes. I took the risk of buying it knowing an infection could happen. Thank you for asking my opinion..</li>
    <li> Just starting the 3rd week of use; no results yet.</li>
    <li> Very Happy with product anxiously awaiting result&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> I like the results I see so far so good .especially my  eyelashes definitely got longer and they seem to thicken some.my eyebrows seem to be coming back,but they might take awhile due to illness I have .I definitely recommend this product.I&#x27;ll be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product as instructed for three weeks. I notice no difference whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I cannot follow the application instructions without getting the product into my eye and it burns like heck.  I would NOT order this product again.  I&#x27;d go with the one I previously used.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I have been using this on my scarce eyebrows and I do see hairs filling in.  I haven&#x27;t tried it yet on my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Delivered right as promised. I&#x27;ve been using for a week. I&#x27;m at awe on how my eyelashes are so full and longer now. I&#x27;m finally getting the lashes I&#x27;ve always wanted. Bat bat!!</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell. I&#x27;ve only been using the product for 28 days, so I don&#x27;t expect any changes yet!  It has a nice thin brush, so no serum is wasted!</li>
    <li> Awesome product and I see a difference in my eyelashes and eyebrows!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a slight change. This is a hard product to rate considering that it can take weeks to show maximum potential. I would love to write another review in a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. Unlike another product I used it doesn&#x27;t cause inflammation of the eyelid.  For me, it is a little slower to obtain a good result. But it&#x27;s only been two weeks and I can see a difference</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used eyelash enhancers before(Latisse, Lash fusion) and this one definitely works. It&#x27;s not as fast as Latisse but at 1/5 the price, I&#x27;m not complaining.  I saw results in my eyelashes within 2 weeks, using it once a day.</li>
    <li> Been using for over a week but on my eye brows. So far it has worked well. Part of my eyebrows never grew always leaving me self conscious but this started working after about 3 days and I am very pleased</li>
    <li> This is a perfect product to have fuller longer eyelashes , this product came just as described .It arrived quickly and the packaging was perfect .It arrived in perfect condition .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a natural eyelash serum , this is the best lash and brow enhancer serum to grow thicker longer eyelashes and bolder eyebrows in about a month. Peptide has been clinically proven to trigger new hair growth. It also nourishes skin around hair follicles, which helps to reverse damage done by false eyelashes and over plucking. This product is made with natural ingredients. And if you stop using it, your lashes will not fall out, unlike other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for awhile and I have seen great results .My eyelashes are thicker and longer , I did get false eyelashes a lot over the past year and they have done a lot of damage to my own lashes . But using this product is restoring my lashes back to their original fullness plus more . This is easy to use and apply just follow the directions and you will have beautiful fuller and longer lashes .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product .</li>
    <li> Have only been using Eyelash and Eyebrow growth for a short period of time but already see results. I&#x27;ve primarily concentrated on the lashes and the amount of lashes that fall out has decreased. Lashes are stronger.  Exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> I received my tube of Aria Starr Beauty Eyelash and Eyebrow Growth Enhancer Serum on 07/21/15.  I started using it the morning I received it, and have noticed the improvements only after 9 days of using this product.  I am 54 years old, and although my hair has yet to turn gray, my eyelashes and eyebrows have turned a blondish/ white color that gives me the appearance of not having eyelashes, or eyebrows.  You can imagine the look that has left me with.  After using this product for 9 days, I can now see my eyebrows; they are a light brown color.  And my eyelashes are the same light brown color, but a little fainter in color.  But I can see that I have eyelashes; which is better than I could 9 days ago.  I really like that this product is made in the USA, and has a 100% satisfaction guarantee.  The company is that sure of its product tells me it must be a good product.  What is even more important to me is that the company does not test its products on animals.  This product has a 75% increase in eyelash thickness and length after 6 weeks of regular use, I cannot wait to see the results!  It will be nice to have lush eyelashes once again, as well as a pair of eyebrows the world can see.  I have been reviewing this product over the last 9 days for UberZon Club.  I am pleased with the results of this product and will happily recommend it to everyone who wants to improve the health, length, and darken their eyelashes and eyebrows.  The product works.</li>
    <li> Simple to use product! Small enough to throw in your purse and take anywhere. My eyelashes seem to be growing.</li>
    <li> I have noticed my eye lashes have become thicker and longer..</li>
    <li> amazing product would try more from this company!</li>
    <li> Have been using for about 2 weeks and am not sure yet of any new lash growth.  Product burns my eyes if applied too close to lay line but quickly subsides.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this a couple of weeks, but it seems to be making my lashes stronger. They appear to be a bit fuller too. So far I like it very much.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this! It&#x27;s the best brand around --- Will always buy this brand! Fast Shipping too!</li>
    <li> I only use on my eye lashes and I only apply at night.  I have noticed a bit of length in the month I have been using WhipLash. I am pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Two weeks in and nothing yet. I&#x27;m a bit skeptical about the other reviews as well because many of them rated the product 4 or 5 stars, yet they said they haven&#x27;t seen any results. Or, they mention they got a discount for writing a review. That doesn&#x27;t seem unbiased to me. Tell me that your lashes are greatly improved by the product THEN give it five stars.  Update -- I did not have any luck with this product, but I was able to eventually get a refund.</li>
    <li> After using this serum for almost five weeks, my lashes definitely look longer and fuller. Apply with a light hand and there is no irritation whatsoever.I have been using on one of my brows since it is thinner than the other and I see a marked improvement!!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as I had expected.</li>
    <li> Shipping was super fast! They sent me an email about the product and I feel really pumped to try it. The instructions were easy to follow and it&#x27;s non irritating on my eyes.</li>
    <li> I sometimes forgot to use this, but when I do, my lashes look thicker.  Its a clear coat so it looks natural</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my lashes nightly for a couple of weeks and I believe that it is working!  I have noticed that when I apply my eye makeup, the small amount of liner I use really emphasizes the thickness of my lashes, along with some mascara.  I love the look as I don&#x27;t need much eye makeup with this and it gives me a younger, fresher look.  I will be purchasing again in a couple of months!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t notice any difference in my lashes</li>
    <li> As described. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Being a natural blonde my lashes are hard to see to begin with. With using this its not only darkened them but made them fuller. Therefore I don&#x27;t have to use as much of my mascara on my eyes which are very sensitive to make-up. This doesn&#x27;t irritate them as make up does, another added benefit.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this religiously now for a few weeks and I can tell a noticeable difference in my lashes. I was skeptical, but figured why not? Can&#x27;t hurt to give it a try. Easy to apply, and results are great!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my eyebrows. I have very light and thin eyebrows. So far I love it. I have no irritation what so ever. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see results but, I&#x27;m excited to see the results. I did receive this product at a reduced rate. However, this has no effect on the integrity of my review. I will update everyone on my results.</li>
    <li> See no difference I think I got a dry tube because I had to scrape to get any on the brush. It ran out after only a couple of weeks.  Thought of asking for a refund.  Will not recommend.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for about 3 weeks now. It &#x27;says&#x27; that is about when it should start to work.  I &#x27;think&#x27; i do see a little bit of growth but i was expecting more. Especially for the price</li>
    <li> So far so good after about 2 weeks for use. I am focused on adding length to my eyebrows, so I put the serum directly on my bald skin following the brow line. There is some crazy hair growth in that area! I will wait for more growth before I get a brow cleaning and shaping.&lt;br /&gt;I also used on my lashes and looking for growth but it&#x27;s hard to tell yet.</li>
    <li> As i am with most products like this im very skeptical. I alwats think its to good to be try ill be stuck wearing false lashes all my life. So i thought it wouldnt hurt to try this what do i got to loose my lashes all already barely there. Ive been using this a couple weeks and i see a huge difference. They are noticeably thicker and longer. Everyday as told to do i take a picture of them so i can see the difference that way. They are now doibl of what they use to be. I apply it before i put my makeup on everyday.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get this home to try on my eyebrows.  Years ago, waxing had been my mainstay when threading had just become a thing.  I decided to try threading on my naturally full eyebrows, only for the old saying to finally catch up with me, and my eyebrows simply did not grow back normally at all.  They were no longer full, but sparse and almost in need of filling in.  I was devastated, and needless to say I NEVER did threading again.  I opened the little bottle (which allows for numerous applications of the serum) excited, and went right to work coating the sporadic areas of my eyebrows.  It was super easy to use, was not sticky or heavy, and it was clear so it didn&#x27;t change the color of anything so it can be used by both women and men.  Now keep my little eyebrow brush handy checking every so often happily anticipating each new result as the days go by.  The product even has a guarantee, so you simply cannot go wrong.  A good buy.</li>
    <li> very very gooooood!!!</li>
    <li> Do not like this product I have used many of these products that work great... This one however burns ur eyes...trust me do not buy it</li>
    <li> First nite I use it some eyebrows fell out that left a big space. Threw it away</li>
    <li> The product is really easy to apply which is great! I&#x27;ve been applying it for 3 days and hopefully my eyelash will grow! (pray)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s working. I notice a slight difference only when I wear mascara.</li>
    <li> Opened package to find a bottle that was leaking and half empty....after almost a year of using &amp;#34;Rapid Lash&amp;#34; I regret trying something new. Against my better judgement, I still tried the product because I was out of RapidLash...within days I had GAPS of lashes break off, and my bottom lashes are so sparse compared to how full and long they were when I applied RapidLash. I will say, I&#x27;m not sure if it was because I received a damaged bottle, but I definitely don&#x27;t recommended this product, my lashes look damaged.</li>
    <li> Naaaa....didn&#x27;t work at all (sad face)</li>
    <li> This is the best not drying like the more expensive products also works fast</li>
    <li> I have not seen any progress, yet, after about 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> I have been using Whiplash as directed and have not seen much of a difference.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long so I can say whether or not it works in regards to hair growth, but I can tell you that the application is simple and very easy to use. It doesn&#x27;t have a loud odor and I haven&#x27;t felt any irritation thus far. Also, the bottle it comes in is so cute.</li>
    <li> Did not notice any hair growth after consistent use after 2 months. Actually noticed I was getting patchy spots and discontinued use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aria Starr for about 3 weeks and I notice thicker lashes already. I&#x27;m very happy with results so far.</li>
    <li> Just love what it does for my lashes.</li>
    <li> My lashes have gotten thicker and longer. I noticed results in 2 weeks. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my lashes!</li>
    <li> It took a little time for me to see the results but it seems surely working. I wasn&#x27;t sure about eyebrow... but this also started to show the good results.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and fast application!</li>
    <li> I will update my review when I see results since I just started to using it.</li>
    <li> I waited to write my review for this product until I had some time to use it.  I have been using this for about a month and I have noticed a difference.  I like many others over plucked my eyebrows in my younger years and having not had much there to begin with my eyebrows were almost no existent.  I was skeptical about this serum since I have tried almost everything to get my eyebrows to grow back.  I use this on my eyebrows once everyday before bedtime.  In the month that I have been using this product, I have noticed that my eyebrows seem a bit thicker and  I have also noticed new growth.  The label states that three weeks you will start to notice a difference but the better results will be seen after six weeks of continuance daily use.  So I suggest to be patient because it is not something that is going to work overnight.</li>
    <li> After a month I see no difference</li>
    <li> I used this product for 3 weeks and never noticed any change to my lashes.</li>
    <li> I was not able to review this, the code i was given was not valid</li>
    <li> I bought this a few weeks ago and have already notice a difference. My eyelashes haven&#x27;t look this full since high school</li>
    <li> Hoping for great results. Have not used it long enough to know if it will actually do what it says. I do like that it does not irritate my eyes though that&#x27;s a plus. I got a discount on this item for my review.</li>
    <li> So far I have been using the eyelash and brow enhancer for 3 weeks and I have not noticed any growth. Perhaps it will take more time to see a difference.  i am sure this small amount is not enough to see a noticeable difference..</li>
    <li> I only used this product one time because it caused a burning sensation on my lash line that lasted for several hours.</li>
    <li> really nice application.</li>
    <li> Lashes are darker and longer but not filling in fuller yet.</li>
    <li> Been using for about 5 days now and I feel like my eyelashes are darker maybe but not sure if they are longer, I will gladly update the review when I have used it for a month.</li>
    <li> This is a very good growth surem. I have noticed a big difference in my lashes since starting this product. They are softer and aren&#x27;t falling out as often. It really helps after a long day of mascara wear.</li>
    <li> Omg my eyebrows are so thick more I manly got this for my eyebrows cause they was so skinny and sparse but not there thick and beautiful I lhave be this. Amazing I swear by it.</li>
    <li> Takes awhile but it does work</li>
    <li> I bought this item for the main purpose of using on my eyelashes.  However, I have also been using it on my eyebrows and I must say that it works very well.  In the past I had thick dark eyebrows but over-plucking and over time they got thinner.  I had no idea it would work so well and fast on my eyebrows.  I have seen improvement in my eyelashes as well but not as much as my eyebrows.  I am very happy with my results so far and I&#x27;m about halfway through the bottle.  I&#x27;m sure i&#x27;ll have the results I desire.</li>
    <li> my review opinion on discounted price of this product  the eyelashes eyebrows enhancer is most amazing product it was a drastic change I works good for me.</li>
    <li> I just received my Item a few days ago. It came super fast! I have tried twice now and think I see improvement already! I know it will take longer to see the full results but so far I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> I definitely feel like my lashes seemed thicker (as in less sparse) within only a week or two of consistent use, and a friend noted the difference as well.  At the very least, Whip Lash is preventing excessive falling out -- I don&#x27;t seem to have any lash loss when I wash my face or take my makeup off.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any lengthening after about a month of use, but that may come when the lashes have had time to grow, or it could be that my lashes have reached their maximum length (I started using this product immediately after running out of Latisse).  I would call this product as effective as Latisse or other prescription lash remedies.  I do like that I don&#x27;t have to worry about the possibility of my eyes changing color if the product does get into the eyes.</li>
    <li> Almost finish the whole tub, but no result whatsoever. and if not careful when apply it it caused irritation the skin around the eye lash</li>
    <li> My daughter has fine strawberry blonde hair. Here lashes are very small and light colored.She likes this product very much. Applies quick and easy.</li>
    <li> I have seen no difference and not a huge fan.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this eyelash and eyebrow. Conditions nicely and especially eyelashes are darker. Will continue to use for additional benefits.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a short time, so I can&#x27;t yet attest to its effectiveness. However, I&#x27;ve been very happy with the application and lack of irritation.</li>
    <li> This Eyelash and Eyebrow Growth serum comes in a very small package, but the contents really work.  We purchased this first container in a promotion for testing and review.  I have noticed my brows becoming thicker and lashes are more abundant.  As the description states, the contents are 2.5ml, though I still have serum left after over 3 weeks of use.  I appreciate that the product is made in the USA in a GMP certified and FDA registered facility, and that the serum has been dermatology and ophthalmology tested to be safe for use.</li>
    <li> Works great so far! Easy to apply</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 3 months now and haven&#x27;t really seen any difference.&lt;br /&gt;I use it nightly after removing makeup.&lt;br /&gt;It has accidentally gotten in my eye and burns really bad.&lt;br /&gt;very disappointed..</li>
    <li> I received this product for free or highly discounted in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to an intense family history of glaucoma, I only used this product on my eyebrows and not on my eyelashes. My doctor advised me against using it on my eyelashes, but this is only because of my family history. It is unique to my situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved using this product on my eyebrows though! My eyebrows and I have had a complex relationship with lots of ups and downs. As an early teen, I had thin eyebrows, and now, I am trying to get back a more natural look than the over-plucked white trash look. I get my brows waxed regularly, so I rarely pluck them anymore. My eyebrow waxer forbids me to touch actually, but I really cannot blame her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works great though. The hairs that I do grow are a lot longer and thicker than before. My brows are slowly filling in, and they do seem a little darker, but I, naturally, have very dark brows, almost black, so I cannot say for sure. Either way, I am very happy with this product. Attached are the serious of photos I took. The first one is day 1 of the journey. I waxed my eyebrows the day before to have a clean-slate. The second was taken a week later, the one after than was a week after that, and the last one was two weeks after that. This is a month&#x27;s worth of growth here without any plucking or waxing since the first day I started. I will keep using this product for now, but I will make a final judgement on whether I would buy it again after I get my brows waxed again. I have a feeling though that I will be buying it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product has had no impact on my eyebrow growth.  Perhaps it works well for others.</li>
    <li> love the idea it will help my wifes eye brows.  she is loving this stuff</li>
    <li> So far I haven&#x27;t seen any differance yet it&#x27;s only been four weeks maybe it takes longer on me I&#x27;m still hoping</li>
    <li> I am very pleased. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I really cannot rate the product yet.  Have only had it a few days.  This product is supposed to help grow eyebrows and eyelashes.  Too soon to know.</li>
    <li> Did not notice a difference -used as directed. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this one didnt work for me</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking for an eyelash growth serum for a little while and decided to try this one.  I have only been using it for about a week and it says it takes a few weeks to see results, but it is time for my review.  Since I haven&#x27;t used this product as long as recommended, I will update my review in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eyelash/eyebrow growth serum is very easy to use.  The applicator is thin and you just swipe it at the base of your eyelashes like you would a liquid eyeliner.  The serum is clear.  I did get some in my eye on accident and it burned a little bit, but other than that I didn&#x27;t have any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this serum on only one side so I could compare to see if I was actually getting results (used on eye on left side of picture).  I have not noticed a different in length, thickness, or color... but, as I said previously, I have only been using this product for a week and will update my review, hopefully with good results!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a change in my lash color but they do seem to be a little longer.  It does seem to burn a little when I put it on but it goes away quickly.</li>
    <li> Having used other products, even though tjis was more reasonable I will not purchase this again.  This lash growth product was unsuccessful for me.</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant when I bought this.  After approximately 3 weeks of nightly application, my eyelashes are longer and darker.  When wearing mascara, they are even longer and thicker.  I have already ordered a second bottle as I do not want to run out while waiting for a new order to arrive.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It seems that my lashes are a little longer but they are so light you can&#x27;t really see the growth. I&#x27;ve been using the peoduct for 3-4 weeks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised - I&#x27;ve purchased several eyelash growth formulations on Amazon and they&#x27;re all so different. Some have saw palmetto as the main ingredient, and many use Swiss Apple Stem Cells &amp; Myristoyl Pentapetide-17, They also have other different ingredients and one you couldn&#x27;t put on your lower lashes, one was not for brows...etc. I&#x27;ve had good luck with all because they do work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is slightly different, besides the normal...&lt;br /&gt;- Thickens eyelashes and eyebrows&lt;br /&gt;- Lengthens eyelashes and eyebrows&lt;br /&gt;- Conditions eyelashes and eyebrows&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will also...&lt;br /&gt;- Darkens eyelashes and eyebrows&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That helps a lot. I like &amp;#34;Whiplash.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s healthy for my lashes and brows, and will make them fuller and darker. It&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes. The applicator has an applicator like a fine paintbrush and you just apply it. Although, it can&#x27;t go on your lower lashes and can only be applied once a day. It comes in a pink container smaller than a mascara tube and it says it will last 3 months. I received this product as part of a promotional deal for my unbiased opinion. I received no compensation and have no connection to this company. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> After only a few weeks of use I&#x27;ve noticed increased thickness and length in lashes. I no longer have to coat on tons of mascara or put on fake lashes in order to have long, full, beautiful lashes. I am in love with this product.</li>
    <li> I just received this today, can&#x27;t wait to try it out tonight. I will keep you posted. This review is a trial through amztrader.  It shipped in perfect time.  I have been using this for a couple weeks and I love it.  No irritation or burning and I do believe I am seeing a difference in my lashes already.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any difference yet but I&#x27;m sure it takes a little bit ! I&#x27;ve only been applying for a few days ! I received this on a promotional deal and was rather disappointed on the little amount I received but hey I guess beggars can&#x27;t be choosers ! Must say though I did receive the product fast with no problems !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks, I have not seen much growth yet.  I have just ordered GrandLash MD because I have a friend that ordered it and has used it 10 days and the improvement is crazy.  I&#x27;m going to try that. This serum seems nice and gave me lashes a soft, hydrated feel.  I just didn&#x27;t see the results quickly.</li>
    <li> I have not been very happy with the Aria Starr Beauty Eyelash Growth. I gave it one star because its easy to apply but it&#x27;s been almost 4 weeks since I have been using it every night and I have not seen any results.</li>
    <li> The jury is still out on this one......I&#x27;m about 3 weeks in and my lashes might be thicker, but not longer yet - I hope!  Fingers crossed....</li>
    <li> Can promote healthy lash growth and enhance your eyebrows. Potent blend of ingredients provides beneficial care and nourishment to lashes and brows. The defined eyeliner type brush facilitates precise application.</li>
    <li> Wow!  I am impressed!  I am using this product now for one month.  My eyelashes were always short and it seemed like I had not a lot of them. I started to use this product and...... what do you know?..... I really see a difference!!  My eyelashes are longer and thicker!  I had at first my doubts but it really works!  Great item!</li>
    <li> I have been using for two weeks and so far, see only subtle difference</li>
    <li> Already I like this product. It does not sting my eyes, nor is it sticky. Looking forward to having thick eyelashes. Will update when I see the results.</li>
    <li> Have not seen much change  but I think they are getting thicker.  I had accidentally singed them.  They look better now.</li>
    <li> Purchased two of these.  I&#x27;m sending one back.  If this product gets in your eyes it burns.  I can see no difference in my lashes since I started using it.  Also, there was nothing on the description that said that it couldn&#x27;t be used on bottom lashes.  Only after reading the directions did I learn this or I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it at all.</li>
    <li> I used it everyday but didn&#x27;t see any difference. wished it work wanted longer lashes.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a short time. That said, I really have not noticed any significant change yet, and I know that miracles don&#x27;t happen overnight and that it will take time for the product to work. I found that it was very easy to apply, no irritation at all for me, no adverse effects at all. I applied it before bed and in the morning. Since I no longer work, I do not use make up, au naturale for me. I do put mascara on occasionally so It is hard to tell at this point if the product works or not. I gave this review 4 stars specifically because like I said before, more time is needed to test product. This product is also suppose to aide in eyebrow growth, I did not use it on my eyebrows as they are fine as they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a full size product for review, my thoughts are my own!</li>
    <li> The product is amazing. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days, and already it seems to be making a difference with my eyelashes and eyebrows. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Lets start with the two active ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredient Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17 is known to not have some of the same side effects as the prescription lash enhancers. If you have light colored eyes this is a definite advantage. Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17 is a keratin stimulating peptide but in most studies is used with -16 as well. I am not sure how well it works on its own long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Malus Domestica Apple Cell Culture Extract- This ingredient is actually an anti-aging ingredient. I am not sure that is what this product is marked for but if it works it is a nice bonus. To me the data isn&#x27;t 100% in on this ingredient. It is an emerging target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other ingredients are probably not irritating for most people. Of course discuss with your dermatologist. I wish the two ingredients were first on the list. I am not sure of their concentration. Still I think it&#x27;s worth a try. I will update as this product takes some time to show full results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item discounted in order to test and review</li>
    <li> I will try about everything when it comes to beauty products. I wil say it&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> As a reviewer of this product, I have to say I&#x27;m actually really impressed. I&#x27;ve only been using this product about a week and at first I didn&#x27;t see any results and wasn&#x27;t very impressed. About the 4th day of using this product I put on some make up and WOOSH my eyelashes were amazing I didn&#x27;t even need to use an eyelash curler! This serum has actually made my lashes grow very long and thicken up quite a bit and I LOVE how they look in such a short time. I have used another eyelash serum once before in the past and it did absolutely nothing for me, so the fact that this product has worked is pretty amazing!</li>
    <li> was missing the tails on my eyebrows and spotty growth throughout. I was tired of filling them in everyday, so decided to try Eyebrow Growth Enhancer Serum and it is a Miracle grower! I now have fuller longer eyebrows and don&#x27;t have to fill in with powder or eyebrow pencils anymore!! No irritation at all, could leave on at night.</li>
    <li> I just recoeved eyelash and eyebrow new&lt;br /&gt;  Xoooqspo92H</li>
    <li> Good serum, I don&#x27;t apply it every night but when I do I think it helps maintain my lashes in place</li>
    <li> I have been diligently using this product for a week now. I been using it on my eyebrows and lashes. I will give it a 4 star for now since I don&#x27;t really see a significant growth on my lashes nor thickening of my eyebrows but I do like a lot of stuff about it. I love the thinness of the applicator that you don&#x27;t have to worry about smudging , dripping or using too much. It&#x27;s really easy to apply. I love that it is very gentle. I was worried that it would irritate or burn my eyes or my skin in general, but that wasn&#x27;t the case at all! Unless you get it in your eyes of course! The consistency is watery, which is nice, makes it easier to apply. Even though I don&#x27;t notice any growth result yet, I do notice that my eyelids, where the hair follicles are, getting darker. I don&#x27;t mind that at all, Less time applying them eyeliners! I also notice that my lashes getting darker  and thicker close to the lids. I am very positive that with continued use, I can expect to see full results. Thanks for letting me purchase at a promotional price to test, try out and review. With their One year Satisfaction Guarantee or your money back, you got nothing to lose!</li>
    <li> I had a coupon to try this product so I thought it was worth a shot. I used it on my eyebrows as that was my main concern. I was pleased that I didn&#x27;t burn like many of the other products I&#x27;d used before. I have only had it for a week or so and I can already tell a difference in the volume. I&#x27;m excited to see what they look like a couple weeks from now ! Definitely would buy again.</li>
    <li> Works in just s few weeks great customer service</li>
    <li> Still waiting to see eyebrow growth</li>
    <li> This did not make my lashes thicker or darker nor did it make me grow more lashes. The only thing it did was make the few lashes I did have, a little bit healthier-less brittle. It never worked on my eyebrows.  Im a little disappointed. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again im just going to try another product. If you want healthier eyelashes this will work but it doesn&#x27;t do anything else in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This serum seems to work well. I do see some improvement in the thickness and length of my eyelashes. I have very fine lashes so I need all the help I can get. It comes in a small bottle, but it lasts a long time since you only use a little bit each time. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with eye irritation at all. I can&#x27;t wear mascara because it irritates my eyes, but this didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes in the least. So far I am pretty impressed with this product. I have decided that I am going to stop using it on one eye and apply it to only one eye from now on so I can really see a difference. After my experiment, I will post a photo showing both of my eyes and you can judge for yourselves if there is a difference. So far though, I am impressed with this eyelash serum.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> I have used eyelash enhancers that were very expensive. They do work after two or three weeks. This is similar to very costly brands and it does the same thing. Thus little bottle should last easily for 30 days even if you use it more than twice a day. You will not see results in three or four days! This is not a miracle potion but you will see results if you actually use it every day. I got mine at a great Amazon deals and ordered more for my daughters.for me the good news is that it does not irritate the eyes as some cheap brands do. That is a big plus.</li>
    <li> Too early to tell but I love the allocator, much easier to apply than other lash growth serums I&#x27;ve tried. A little uncomfortable when it gets in your eyes so make sure to use at night. I&#x27;ll have to come back in a few weeks and update my review to let you know for sure if it truly weeks! I received this highlight discounted to review.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to try this product for awhile now when I was offered a chance to review Aria Starr eyelash eyebrow growth formula I jumped at it .I have been using it faithfully for 10 days and my lashes are already feeling softer and are starting to look healthier  .Thank You Aria Starr&lt;br /&gt;I have also noticed some eyebrow growth which helps me avoid the &amp;#34;painted on brow&amp;#34;look</li>
