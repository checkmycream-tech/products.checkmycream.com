<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Best essential oil for a cold and sinus trouble. My husband and I took our diffuser and Thieves with us on a long trip. We were staying in several different hotels. We both usually have trouble with our sinuses when we travel. But I turned on the diffuser with just 4 drops of Thieves in it as soon as we entered our room and let it run for about 4 hours while we were there. No sinus trouble at all.&lt;br /&gt;Our daughter had an awful head cold, her doctor put her on a medicine with an antihistamine, guaifenesin and Dextromethorphan. (She is 14.) This did not help her at all. It also made her heart race and she was scared to continue taking it. I mixed her up a jar with coconut oil and Thieves and she rubbed it on the bottom of her feet twice a day for three days straight. She also put 2 drops of Thieves in her green tea in the morning and at night. Within 3 days she was almost completely well and by the sixth day she had no more symptoms.</li>
    <li> Also great to add to hot tea if you&#x27;re sick.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; great service!</li>
    <li> Love the smell!  I use this in the diffuser, or mixed with a carrier oil for my trigger points to combat a virus and mixed in my hand soap or mopping water.  I also mix it in a spray bottle of water, to combat spreading germs.</li>
    <li> Excellent essential oil.  I put it with a carrier oil on the bottoms of my feet each day to help with my immune system.</li>
    <li> order came with samples and was a great product all around! ty</li>
    <li> I just started using Young Living&#x27;s oils and am already in love with them! Since it&#x27;s cold &amp; flu season, I&#x27;ve been diffusing Thieves oil at home and even got a USB diffuser to use at work to ward off all the germs! It also keeps the home/office smelling great! This is probably one of (if not THE) most versatile oil I&#x27;ve seen, there are SO many uses and I&#x27;ve been enjoying trying out all the different ones!</li>
    <li> Extraordinary oil. I&#x27;ll never be without it!!!!</li>
    <li> I love the clove smell.</li>
    <li> Has helped me and my family &amp;#34;fight off&amp;#34; viruses. I really didn&#x27;t expect it to work so well but I&#x27;ve been very happily surprised. My daughter got a cold that was &amp;#34;going around&amp;#34; at her job. Her co-workers were jealous to see how much more quickly she got over it than they did and it was thanks to the Thieves Oil! We apply it to the back of our necks and the bottoms of our feet. You have to use it frequently for it to really work. It&#x27;s expensive but worth it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this oil! I have been using it every night, applying to the bottoms of my feet and have not had a single sniffle, sneeze or cough. It smells fantastic, too!!!</li>
    <li> Loved this product.  Its a hot oil so just make sure you dilute it.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of it!!</li>
    <li> A clean scent for diffusing</li>
    <li> A must have in every household.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I had no problems</li>
    <li> Smells great, especially at the holidays.</li>
    <li> Love this jyst wish it were cheaper:)</li>
    <li> Please remember that this is a 5ml bottle for $22.00, whereas the company sells it for $44.41 for ~~~15ml~~~. So just be aware of your spending for this wonderful oil. And, NO,  I have nothing to do with the company and have never bought anything from them. I just know about Thieves Oil from a friend. Yes, I&#x27;ve tried it and it&#x27;s excellent!</li>
    <li> Love it - Would recommend to anyone!!</li>
    <li> I love thieves oil! I normally would get this through Young Living but decided to try through amazon because I needed something cheaper and faster. This was still young living&#x27;s product (if you are concerned about a knock off) and it worked as intended. I diffused it because we were sick in the house! I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> The scent and taste of this ordered oil was off; not sure if this is a knock off, or the seller is selling bad products.</li>
    <li> A drop goes a long way! Scent is pleasant. I mix it with a few drops of Argon oil. Never greasy.</li>
    <li> This powerful essential oil is like a miracle in a bottle.  Must have for sore throats and ideal to have when cold symptoms arise.</li>
    <li> As you can see in the photo, the seal is cracked on the bottle. This was my first purchase so I didn&#x27;t pay attention to that. I&#x27;m not sure that what I got was the authentic Young Living oil, so don&#x27;t know what to say. I&#x27;m using it, but with nothing to compare it to, I have no idea if it&#x27;s the real deal. I think it&#x27;s best to purchase from a distributor or sign up to be a distributor so you know what you&#x27;re really getting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for a few months now so I know its awesome! But I was so impressed with the seller. The seller included I formation about the oil and how to place it. I think that is so wonderful. I will definitely do my future buisness with this seller. Thank you!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for Thieves Essential Oil this is the product. We bought some Thieves Oil at a organic type store and it was more than twice the price of this product. My wife likes it, enough said.</li>
    <li> Using Thieves in combination with RC for the winter.  Love the smell.  Only wish the bottle were bigger. Love it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell and kills bacteria in home</li>
    <li> I have ordered this several times before and will continue to order it.I put it in a diffuser and run it all day.Very strong oil and lasts well in the diffuser.</li>
    <li> Amazing product for massage, for taking orally, for putting in humidifier - helps with killing germs in the air. Very spicy smelling and very relaxing.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with my purchase. It arrived in good condition. It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  Convenient little jar/vial easy to take along or store.  Smells like kitchen cooking vs. medicine.  Looking forward to using it to contribute to healthful living.</li>
    <li> Still in the &amp;#34;testing&amp;#34; phase to see how well it works, but it&#x27;s been good so far. The only gripe I have is the price for such a tiny bottle.. I mean, c&#x27;mon.. Will looking to make my own next time, or find some that is less expensive.</li>
    <li> Thieves Essential Oil by Young Living is the real deal.  It has kept me from getting sick, even with direct and constant contact with a sick/coughing person, AND it got my loved one better in about 2 days instead of 2 weeks of being sick!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re a waste of money. For the love of God, go to the doctor and get some damn medicinr.</li>
    <li> Nice scent &amp; is effective.</li>
    <li> Smells really great, but way too expensive to keep reordering</li>
    <li> If you hesitant to try this oil, I say go for it!! It works different on everyone, but the key here is it works.!</li>
    <li> Be aware that this is only 5ml.  I missed that in the description. This is a third of the size of what I normally order, so it&#x27;s much more expensive per ml than the regular size bottle. I won&#x27;t ever buy this size again.  Other than that it&#x27;s good Thieves Oil.  This is the only essential oil for me to survive cold and flu season!</li>
    <li> Pleased with purchase</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I was at my brother&#x27;s house last Christmas Day and my sis-in-law was super sick, which started the day before, and my niece and nephe had gotten it as well. I was &amp;#34;exposed&amp;#34; to whatever was floating around (Eek!) but my step-mom had me rub Thieves on the bottom of my feet and put socks on right then and there. I didn&#x27;t get whatever was floating around. Another couple times I believe this worked was when my boyfriend and I got back from our Whistler ski trip (can you say over exposure to tons of people and germs...we live in South Florida) and he got the flu, but I was fine. I did quarantine him a bit ;) I used Thieves on my feet every night while we were away and I also brought it on the airplane and rubbed a little bit under my nose. So maybe it worked?! Then he had a couple colds and I would religiously use this during those times and I was fine. Oh yeah, did I mention I work with preschoolers?! Yep, I try to rub it on my feet, behind my ears, and dab a little bit below my nose a few times a week. Hopefully it&#x27;ll continue to kick those germs&#x27; butts!</li>
    <li> Works great, I use as few drops in glass water every morning, mouth feels fresh. Also diffuse, love this to clean air. Suffered from chronic sinus problems, so much better now.</li>
    <li> I use this product for everything.  Will keep away colds, fight infection and take away respiratory connection and coughs.  The best</li>
    <li> Really Great buy!  Excellent shopping at this store.  Would not hesitate to purchase other items certainly as well for sure.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.. I won&#x27;t even go out of the house without dabbing a bit on... according to what I&#x27;ve read.. wearing it keeps you 99.6% free from germs... don&#x27;t know if it works.. but I can tell you I rarely rarely get sick... I use to only use it in the winter months.. but&lt;br /&gt;these days I just use it when ever I go out...&lt;br /&gt;my oil came nicely wrapped very quickly and I am very pleased with both packaging and  quick delivery..</li>
    <li> Works great for my allergies within a few minutes!  Excellent!</li>
    <li> I am using this to make my own bug spray.  It is working great! I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> If you order this product from young living, it is about 45.00 for a 15ml bottle, so you get three times more for about $15 dollars more which is somewhat cheaper.  I mistakenly thought this was a .5 oz. bottle which is my mistake so I will live with that.  I should have read more closely, but I didn&#x27;t even know they made this small a bottle.  If you don&#x27;t mind paying more, everything else about this item seems to be legit.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite oil.  It never lets me down.</li>
    <li> very pleasant taste...heard good things about the benefits of good gum health with this product.</li>
    <li> Great product for so many things. Also bought the cleaning thieves and it cleans everything beautifully, even glass. Leaves it crystal clean. Don&#x27;t put it on your skin without using oil with it. My granddaughter burned her face trying to get rid of a pimple.</li>
    <li> Loved it! Came quickly. Accurate description and priced right.</li>
    <li> smaller bottle than i expected but the product is as usual amazing</li>
    <li> been taking this not even a sniffle of a cold plan on re-ordering it</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> anything and everything anti-viral is a MUST these days.</li>
    <li> Smells like Christmas.  Mix with a little bit of carrier oil (I personally use grapeseed) and massage onto feet at bedtime and feel better by morning.  I&#x27;ve used it on my daughters and it helps them too!</li>
    <li> Love this i keep it diffusing in my living room and it keeps the air clean and smelling great</li>
    <li> Thieves is SO amazing for the gums, wow!!</li>
    <li> When I feel a cold coming on I put a few drops of thieves in a glass of warm water. Cold dissipates.</li>
    <li> Nice oil, had a good workable consistency.  Bought it mainly for the therapeutic nature of Thieves oil blend.</li>
    <li> love the essential oils - works great in diffuser</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery...very happy with the price and the product...thank you!!!</li>
    <li> This oil smells amazing. It is like someone took all the best smells of fall and Christmas and put them in a bottle. The smell last forever when you use it and can be incorporated into several different preparations. You can even add it to some cleaning items. I use it almost like a perfume and everywhere I go someone asks me what it is. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great oil especially for the flu season would recommend this product to anybody smells great also</li>
    <li> I have been studying essential oils and can say first hand this is hands down the best oil to have if any. Thank you</li>
    <li> not what i expected.  Aroma was significantly less that same product purchased from YL</li>
    <li> It was a gift, which we purchased for a friend who has a persistent cough and throat tickle.  We use the product to clear any oncoming cold, so we figured it might help our friend.  And it did!  It smells/tastes wonderful if you like cinnamon and cloves and lemon.  Not sure what all the ingredients are, but the fragrance is really nice AND it clears congestion.  A Young Living rep once gave me a bottle when I was plagued with a very congested chest cold.  She told me to put a drop or two on the back of my throat AND put a couple drops in drinking water (and drink often).  It certainly seems to help, and it feels good to be proactive about getting well instead of waiting for time to pass.  This is a really good product.</li>
    <li> Though the product is good, the price for this bottle is ridiculous.</li>
    <li> I really love the fact that Thieves oil has prevented me from getting the flu this winter..... I also have not gotten bronchitis... What a sweet,sweet, miricle :)))))</li>
    <li> The smell of this oil isn&#x27;t as strong as the one I sampled.i kept it and used it all.  I didn&#x27;t think anything of it till I ran into a young distributer to order more.  I purchased a 15ml for $32.00!&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I will buy this from her from now on! Lesson learned!</li>
    <li> My chiropractor introduced me to this and I used it all winter. Absolutely the best thing ever for congestion, coughing and sinus relief! I shared it with coworkers and they ended up purchasing their own too</li>
    <li> fast shipping authentic product</li>
    <li> This oil lives up to it&#x27;s reputation. I bought it for a friend that lives in a dormitory setting. He seems to be doing well while others around him are coming down with serious illnesses: pneumonia, bronchitis, upper respiratory infections... not sure what&#x27;s causing so much illness in Kansas City at this time of year. Winter hasn&#x27;t even set in yet!</li>
    <li> This is a quality product. Works as advertised . This item was packaged well and delivered early.</li>
    <li> Love this! Smells like Christmas!</li>
    <li> Thieves essential oil is great I also ordered the Young Living Lemon essential oil.This oil has the freshest scent of lemon that can be found. I sometimes put a few drops in water to drink to clear my throat. I have always kept a bottle around.  Recently, I ran out &amp; picked up a bottle from another company, at the health food store. I was dissappointed because the quality was no where near Young Living oils, so I quickly got online to get the lemon oil I  love.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and received it quickly</li>
    <li> I would recommend it to anyone who is ever plagued by sore throats, sinus infections.  Put a drop in water and gargle at night and your sore throat will be gone in the morning.  It smells great also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Thieves Essential Oils by an advertisement in Yoga magazine. I am delighted with the product and plan to re-order on the future.</li>
    <li> Amazing in hot tea for a cold or flu!</li>
    <li> Best stuff EVER! If you&#x27;re going to buy Essential Oils Young Living&#x27;s Thieves Oil is a must have. I&#x27;ve tried other brands of Thieves, and this is the one to own! The aroma is like quality potpourri. I can&#x27;t get enough of the stuff. It is a therapeutic-grade of essential oil and my bottle of 0.17 fl oz (5 ml) has 85 precious drops, according to the manufacturer. Buy your essential oil in small bottles, like this one, because it evaporates quickly.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on a recommendation from a friend.  I use it for mouth canker sores.  As soon as I feel an eruption starting, I apply Thieve Oil with a Q-tip and then repeat several times over the next couple of days and the eruption either doesn&#x27;t happen or it is very minor.</li>
    <li> Love it, many uses such as keeps away colds, sore throats, great  disinfectant etc.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It help keep me from getting sick.</li>
    <li> A great EO; a must have!</li>
    <li> This is the first Young Living oil I have purchased, and though it was very small and very expensive and I have no other YL oil experience to compare it to, the oil was very concentrated and seemed to boost my immune system.</li>
    <li> Really depend on this for keeping us healthy.  I had ordered it many times.  Never got the flu or colds all winter and now into spring.</li>
    <li> I had many doubts.  Six sick in the house and I have had minimal symptoms and I am typically the worst when it comes to being sick.  I do not think it is just a placebo effect.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this oil.  I diffuse it about 3 times a week for about 30 minutes.  Especially great for cold/flu season.  I also rub on the bottoms of my feet about once a week or more often when sick.</li>
    <li> Keeps the colds away!  I love this product.  Expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> love the smell, kicks a cold fast, keeps the trash smelling fresh especially in the hot summer months!</li>
    <li> A great product. Cure All. Everyone loves it. Will order again when needed.&lt;br /&gt;Young Living is simply the Best!!! Thank you.</li>
    <li> My product arrived on&lt;br /&gt;time, in good condition...gave this as a gift and my friend loves it. No complaints on this item</li>
    <li> Recommended by my neighbor and I&#x27;m very pleased. Thank you.</li>
    <li> My Thieves Oil arrived in good time and was exactly what I wanted.  A friend had given me a few drops in a small spray bottle with water last year.  I spray this in and around my mouth and face each day as a boost to my immune system.  It must work since I don&#x27;t get sick in spite of the large number of people I am around while teaching art.</li>
    <li> This might work as promised but I simply cannot tolerate the odor enough to let it permeate my room , even for health purposes.</li>
    <li> The bottle was so small and had so little product, I felt cheated!  I could not even measure what the product did because it was so small of a dosage.</li>
    <li> This product came to me on time and nicely packed. It smells wonderful, and is very useful to have to help ward off colds and flu. I use it in my humidifier.</li>
    <li> i was dissapointed that the bottles were so small--I&#x27;d expected the regular sized bottles for the price I&#x27;d paid. I will definitely check the size more closely next time.</li>
    <li> AWESOME PRODUCT...So Expensive.</li>
    <li> This product helps you from getting sick when you are out in public around others who are sick or the have the Flu. Great product.</li>
    <li> Love this oil- if anyone interested in buying directly from the manufacturer- feel free to email me at natalya.shtokman@gmail.com.  Buying directly will get you this for a lot cheaper and you know it&#x27;s the real thing!</li>
    <li> Wonderful ! antiseptic and a disinfectant. I feel good using Young Living essential oils, as they are super clean and pure quality.</li>
    <li> Healed my sore throat in 2 days and my child&#x27;s canker sore in 2 days!  I&#x27;ve used many other OTC and this is the best!</li>
    <li> The best,,, I love the smell of cloves, cinnamon , rosemary ,lemon blended  to build your immune system, kills germs in the mouth and on your gums,, u can make a toothpaste of coconut oil in the solid state and a few drops of thieves and  maybe even some baking soda and make a paste and brush your teeth and gums. Put it on small cuts or scratches and then later to help with healing use lavender oil.</li>
    <li> the oil was great and will order again</li>
    <li> Thieves is a very earthy smell. Its grounding and heightening the senses simultaneously. I use it in the diffuser to scent the house.  Bugs hate it  :  ) and its a mold retardant.</li>
    <li> This is great to fight mold, viruses and funguses. I am a singer and also sip it in my water throughout the day. REally helps me sing longer and stronger.</li>
    <li> I use this in with my vaporizer and the smell is wonderful. Kills germs!! When my husband was sick, I didn&#x27;t want to catch it so I would use this around and it worked!</li>
    <li> Scam…. I tried this at the beginning phase of a cold and it did nothing for me. I rubbed it into my feet for 3 nights in a row and also added a few drops to Hot water to inhale a couple of times. Well almost 3 weeks now and I still have a terrible cold that will not go away…. Maybe this formula is diluted? it doesn&#x27;t have a super strong scent like I am reading about. Pretty disappointing considering the price of this tiny bottle.</li>
    <li> It smells great and I feel as though I have a protected barrier around me in this world of sneezes and coughs.</li>
