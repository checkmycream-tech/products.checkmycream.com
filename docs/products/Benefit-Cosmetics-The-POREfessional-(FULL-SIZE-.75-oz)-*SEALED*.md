      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing-</li>
      <li>Its just amazing, just like magic! :)</li>
      <li>I purchase this item all the time directly from Benefit, and it is wonderful, so</li>
      <li>I guess I should&#x27;ve know the price was too good to be true.</li>
      <li>This is great for large pores.</li>
      <li>So glad I found this and will always keep using it as part of my makeup regimen.</li>
      <li>Been using for more than a year now.</li>
      <li>Get the real thing - it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>It works better than anything I have used.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff -seals pores well.</li>
      <li>If I ever become rich and famous this will be on my shopping list for sure.</li>
      <li>Lightweight and non greasy and offers great coverage.</li>
      <li>Goes on so smooth and light, looks natural on a fair skinned person like me!</li>
      <li>Amazon is such a great company, I would think they would vet these sellers better.</li>
      <li>On top of that, the protective seal was not attached to the top and it was very sticky because it appears that adhesive was added to it in attempt to reseal the top of the tube.</li>
      <li>Visibly reduces pores and fine lines.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never felt my skin so smooth.</li>
      <li>It makes your pores disappear and smooths your face so your makeup goes on smooth not clumpy from your pores and wrinkles</li>
      <li>I use just a very very small amount on my &amp;#34;T-zone&amp;#34; area and it hides pores and mattifies shine perfectly.  </li>
      <li>The most AMAZING pore filler / primer I have ever used-more so than any other product used regardless of price.</li>
      <li>It is not a fake (like i&#x27;ve seen some people post about it here in amazon), since she brought it over to a credible/reliable saloon and they corroborated that it is legit!</li>
      <li>Honestly it&#x27;s the first one for me to use daily</li>
      <li>Monistat Chafing relief powder gel is much better and stays on and is only $8.99 at your drug store or on Amazon.</li>
      <li>My skin looks so different, for the better, with this product.  </li>
      <li>So glad I finally found this!</li>
      <li>Not totally gone but better than anything else I have tried.  </li>
      <li>Benefit charges $30 for the guaranteed real thing.</li>
      <li>Was skeptical but it is the best so far.</li>
      <li>Very gentle and soft in the skin.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t cover completely but pretty well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 62 and the older</li>
      <li>Worth the price because it last forever.</li>
      <li>the same silky, smooth product Benefit actually makes.</li>
      <li>and I can barely see the pores anymore.</li>
      <li>I was a bit disappointed in this product for all the great reviews it gets.</li>
      <li>This was a thick pinkish color, VERY FRAGRANT (very different fragrance from the real stuff) and STICKY.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> in the fact I&#x27;m so happy to try it , I would recommend everyone try it&lt;br /&gt;good lack&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best regard</li>
    <li> A must have staple to your makeup collection. Lightweight and non greasy and offers great coverage. Visibly reduces pores and fine lines.</li>
    <li> I was sold a knock off product so I am not able to comment on the actual product. When I tried to return it the tube was mysteriously &amp;#34;empty&amp;#34; so I was not able to get my money back.</li>
    <li> Goes on so smooth and light, looks natural on a fair skinned person like me! Love it!</li>
    <li> My daughter got me on to this stuff.  It makes your pores disappear and smooths your face so your makeup goes on smooth not clumpy from your pores and wrinkles</li>
    <li> This is great for large pores.</li>
    <li> Similar to other reviewers, I got a rip-off -- it&#x27;s in no way the same silky, smooth product Benefit actually makes. I got mine from Bmore Cosmetics, so do not purchase from them.  Amazon is such a great company, I would think they would vet these sellers better.</li>
    <li> I love this product I don&#x27;t know what I would do without this stuff! Its just amazing, just like magic! :)</li>
    <li> All I can say is that my wife loves it! It is not a fake (like i&#x27;ve seen some people post about it here in amazon), since she brought it over to a credible/reliable saloon and they corroborated that it is legit!</li>
    <li> I purchase this item all the time directly from Benefit, and it is wonderful, so I know that the product I received from vendor CALIFEE is an imposter. It is supposed to be TRANSLUCENT and SILKY. This was a thick pinkish color, VERY FRAGRANT (very different fragrance from the real stuff) and STICKY. On top of that, the protective seal was not attached to the top and it was very sticky because it appears that adhesive was added to it in attempt to reseal the top of the tube.</li>
    <li> I got a fraudulent product! This is NOT the same stuff that I&#x27;ve gotten at retail stores. I guess I should&#x27;ve know the price was too good to be true.</li>
    <li> This product does everything it says. Makes your skin smooth and prepped for foundation and fills in your pores to give a flawless complexion. Been using for more than a year now.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It makes my pores look like they are NOT there. I will continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> This product is great! I use just a very very small amount on my &amp;#34;T-zone&amp;#34; area and it hides pores and mattifies shine perfectly.  Also great for touch ups after make-up is applied.  Feels great on!</li>
    <li> I was a bit disappointed in this product for all the great reviews it gets. It came to me dusty, so the container must have been sitting around for awhile. Also, it is really expensive for what you get and you have to reapply. Monistat Chafing relief powder gel is much better and stays on and is only $8.99 at your drug store or on Amazon. Give that a try instead!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff -seals pores well.</li>
    <li> Very awesome and feels great on the skin</li>
    <li> The most AMAZING pore filler / primer I have ever used-more so than any other product used regardless of price. Buy it and you will be hooked!</li>
    <li> Benefit charges $30 for the guaranteed real thing. This is a sham and maybe a scam too. Get the real thing - it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Perfect for making skin appear smooth. Definitely helps hide the hideous pores</li>
    <li> Was skeptical but it is the best so far. Pores were hidden about 80%. Not totally gone but better than anything else I have tried.  So glad I finally found this!</li>
    <li> This primer is great! Honestly it&#x27;s the first one for me to use daily and it&#x27;s perfect. FIlls the lines under my eyes beautifully.</li>
    <li> My skin looks so different, for the better, with this product.  So glad I found this and will always keep using it as part of my makeup regimen.</li>
    <li> Very gentle and soft in the skin.</li>
    <li> It works better than anything I have used. I&#x27;m 62 and the older you get the larger your pores get. Doesn&#x27;t cover completely but pretty well. Worth the price because it last forever. When you have squeezed all you can out cut it in half. You will be amazed at how much is left.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing- I&#x27;ve never felt my skin so smooth. It immediately smooths out my face and I can barely see the pores anymore. Unfortunately, you do pay for the quality with the high price, but if you have the money then go for it. If I ever become rich and famous this will be on my shopping list for sure.</li>
