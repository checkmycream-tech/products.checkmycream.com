<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this. Great for traveling</li>
    <li> quality was as expected</li>
    <li> My only problem with this thing is that I can&#x27;t go back in time with it! This thing would have been so useful back in college, or in my overnight bag for trips with friends, and a ton of other situations! I LOVE that you can change out the heads on it and keep using it. When I initially bought mine I thought it was a single use razor. Thank goodness that it&#x27;s not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two. One for home use (the small handle is great for shaving the bikini area) and one in my travel bag for taking with me on trips. If you just take the blade off and bring the handle, you can put it in your carryon and purchase a blade at your destination.</li>
    <li> Works better than regular Venus, closer shave.  I spend the extra money and use these exclusively</li>
    <li> Very compact for travel and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I make personal and work trips often, so I have been putting together a good travel bag of essential items.  This is one of the final touches in my travel kit and it&#x27;s perfect.  It comes in a little blue plastic snap case and doesn&#x27;t take up much room.  I&#x27;m quite happy with the purchase!</li>
    <li> Just like the regular Venus razor, but sized for traveling.</li>
    <li> Bought this to go on vacation. It is the perfect travel size!</li>
    <li> Great for travel and produces the same results as a standard razor.</li>
    <li> Keep an eye out for deals on this razor -- I got mine as a $8 Prime Add-On option... plus a $5 instant coupon, WHAT? This guy is $13 at my local CVS. You can barely buy one Venus Embrace blade for the price of this razor (and blade), and this little guy is FANTASTIC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes such a difference to get that close to the areas you&#x27;re shaving. I&#x27;ve never had more efficient, pleasant, thorough, nick-free shaving experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not even kidding, this is one of the very best things I purchased last year, anywhere.</li>
    <li> Added this to my bathroom kit for a recent 7 day cruise. Much easier to shave standing up in the shower than the regular handled versions and took up very little space in my bathroom kit!</li>
    <li> nice and compact for travel</li>
    <li> Very handy for traveling</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give it 10 stars if they&#x27;d have made the handle less slippery. If your in the shower soapy, this handle is slippery, if not, then not slippery. I like the size, shape, ease of use better than a regular razor handle. Despite the shortcoming of slipperiness, I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel! Love the small size and case!</li>
    <li> She loves  the ease. I love the results</li>
    <li> I have a lot of normal size Gillette Venus, but not convenient to carry when traveling. With this compact Venus, so I am looking forward to the next trip!</li>
    <li> This is just great.  It tilts and moves to give a close shave on curved areas.  It is small and give great control.  Wish I had gotten one sooner.  Will be ordering another for home use and use this one for the gym.</li>
    <li> Perfect travel, on the go item</li>
    <li> Really liked it. the case makes it very convenient to carry around. The length of the handle is of the perfect size and the razor is very easy to maneuver</li>
    <li> Bought this strictly for travel. Works great, but is definitely less easy to maneuver due to the short handle. Excellent shave, but people with any issues to grip and/or hands may have problems.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my very first time using a Gillette Venus Razor! And for the first time I&#x27;d like to say that it is very accurate. This razor is truly amazing, because it is very easy to transport anywhere. And by anywhere I mean ANYWHERE! Because of its size it&#x27;s like a travel size razor! And I&#x27;m not very sure if it is but It sure seems like it! I very much live that it is 5 blades instead of 3 because it increases the chances of actually getting a spot you missed with a 3 blade razor! And I&#x27;m not very sure of this but it has a soap that besets it and I&#x27;m not very much aware of all these types of razor because personally I use a machine to shave my legs. But anyways I love how it has that because instead of using shaving cream or lathering your legs in soap you could have no trouble just saving like that, but I course you would have to moisten it first. And I enjoy how it&#x27;s not irritating like so either razors would be. Of course it is like any other razor, it has no magical powers of not letting your hair grow any slower than other razors. And it is pretty expensive but overall it even comes with it&#x27;s own travel box to take it wherever it is needed!</li>
    <li> This little razor is not only super cute with it&#x27;s travel size and little carrying case, but it works great!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed the product. When I had shave the favor got close and not just that it didn&#x27;t have little hairs so it was very close and my skin was also feeling very soft</li>
    <li> I have been using the generic razor, especially when I am on the go.  I usually end up cutting myself, and do not like the scars that are left behind.  Ever since I was young, shaving is not my favorite thing to do, my legs are usually bumpy and red after shaving, and therefore, I only shave when I absolutely have to.&lt;br /&gt;The Venus Snap with Embrace works wonders.  The very day my razor came, I had to try it out.  My legs were smooth, I didn’t have to shave or go back over my legs 2 or 3 times, and NO bumps.  This is an absolute plus.  With a young child all the extra time I get is great.  I spend even less time shaving, since I don’t have to re-shave because the razor didn’t work properly.  My legs were smooth and shiny, and I could even wear a dress without becoming embarrassed.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the size is perfect for on the go, and for everyday use.  You can throw it in your purse, travel bag, or put it in the medicine cabinet.  I believe I may end up using this for everyday shaving, and dump to generic disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was given to me to review by Influenster.</li>
    <li> I always had issues with razors in general, I love the compact case, it is ideal for people on the go or vacation. the five blades give a clean fresh cut and leave my skin super smooooth. i love it.</li>
    <li> I think the short handle makes this razor kind of awkward to use and I think I get a better shave from my other big-name-brand razor. It&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s now great.</li>
    <li> I received this complimentary from Influenster voxbox and I absolutely love it! It fits right into my Purse and works wonderful, even without soap! I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I recieved this in my VoxBox and I love the size and how it looks. It fits well in my purse and when I need to use it I can. It works great.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor! It is so convenient to take with you when you&#x27;re going somewhere and fits perfectly into anything with it&#x27;s cute little compact case. You can also take the blade off and switch it onto one of your regular razor handles when you&#x27;re at home too.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect if you are going to be constantly on the go.  It fits perfectly into a purse or suitcase without requiring too much hassle and the blades give you a great, close, smooth shave.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for something to travel with.</li>
    <li> This razor is very convenient for travel as it is tiny and has a little case to pop it into. The razor itself is as one would expect from Gillette, pretty great. It&#x27;s definitely too small for everyday use for me, but it will live in my travel bag and go on many adventures.</li>
    <li> Everything about this razor is great! The quality since it&#x27;s a Gillette Venus, the size, and even the carrying case. It screams travel with me! I&#x27;m super excited to bringing it around with me this summer season!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m constantly on the go and this razor has become an essential item in my purse and travel bag for the summer. It&#x27;s a great size, effective, and packaged in its own snap pack. It&#x27;s perfect for me!</li>
    <li> I love the Venus snap! It&#x27;s so small and fits everywhere. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s supposed to be convenient for trips and vacations but you still have to bring along Shaving cream, which is not small and cannot fit anywhere. If I was going overseas, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to take shaving cream at all.</li>
    <li> Super cute little razor. Great for on the go and it works just as well as the larger Venus razor. I received mine from influenster for reviewing purposes.</li>
    <li> I love how small and portable this razor is&lt;br /&gt;It gets right to the root of my hairs on my legs</li>
    <li> I love this razor not only because it&#x27;s travel size but because it works better than any razor I have used in the past. It literally got every hair and left my skin so smooth. Thanks Influenster and Gillette Venus for allowing me the opportunity to test out this product for free. Will make sure to recommend it to friends and family as well as my YouTube subscribers.</li>
    <li> I received this razor complimentary of Influenster. I really enjoy the concept of this product and the convenience it offers. It would be perfect for travel or touch ups on the go. The only problem I had with it was due to the sensitive nature of my own skin, using the razor with just water left my skin slightly irritated. But otherwise I&#x27;d say this product is a good one.</li>
    <li> I love this razor works great and i love the small compact size and case i can always have a razor on hand!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to care about expensive/brand name razors. I&#x27;ve been purchasing the 2 blade Bic razors in multi-packs for years and they&#x27;ve worked fine for me. Maybe it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t have too much body hair? Could be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Bic&#x27;s 2 blade razors (with the moisture strip), I would undoubtedly cut myself when using a new one. That doesn&#x27;t happen with the Venus Snap razor. In fact, I had to rush my shower a few days ago yet was still able to shave because this razor gets it done fast and effectively. I also really love the grip; it gives me a lot of control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have one complaint about this razor, though. I am very thin so my armpits are naturally sunken in. I always have to pull on the skin to be able to reach all of the hairs. Unfortunately this razor isn&#x27;t the best for my underarms because it&#x27;s longer and wider than what I&#x27;m used to. For that I go back to my Bic because it&#x27;s slimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I would recommend this razor. Not only is it great for traveling, but who says you can&#x27;t use a mini razor at home?</li>
    <li> This is one of my newest favorite products! Life can get so busy sometimes and I can be really forgetful. So with spring and summer almost here and breaking out those tank tops some times I may forget to shave under my arms but I don&#x27;t have to worry about it all day because I have the Venus Snap in my purse now.  It&#x27;s perfect for a busy lifestyle.  Or for taking on a trip and packing light!</li>
    <li> Venus has always been my favorite razor and now it comes in a compact size perfect for on the go. The Venus Snap is the perfect size to throw in your purse and be on your way. I never have to worry about those missed spots again.</li>
    <li> I was really amazed with this razor and I must say I really enjoy the shorter handle I feel like it gave me a lot of control.  I also loved that it had 4 blades, it gave me such a close shave.  I will be recommending this to friends.</li>
    <li> Actually surprised at the ease of this razor. I like it more then the regular razor, seems to have more control.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillete Venus Snap from Influester to try it out and I love it. It&#x27;s compact so you can literally take it anywhere, I know, a lot of you must be wondering why would I want to just randomly have a razor in my purse, but trust me, this little one came in very handy for those little hairs I usually miss around my knees, as usual, I didn&#x27;t notice till I was out and about, but the Snap saved the day. One of the things I was concerned about with this tiny razor was being able to get a good hold of it to avoid any cuts, but I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it, it has great grip and it&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
    <li> I received this razor complimentary from Influenster.com. I thought the packaging was visually appealing and also practical. I think it would be great for travel or when in a rush because of the case. I had a little bit of a hard time getting adjusted to the short handle, but found it to be a convenience in some areas.</li>
    <li> not only has venus been the best razor ever but this product is awesome i take it with me to the gym and on vacation! small enough to travel with but big enough to get the job done!!</li>
    <li> So, I signed up to be a part of the latest Influenster box, which was all about shaving.  I took the survey and I qualified for the box and it arrived at my house about a week later.  The Venus Snap with Embrace is the smallest razor I&#x27;ve ever seen in my life.  It&#x27;s cute, it&#x27;s adorable, I want to carry it in my purse just to show people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, let&#x27;s start with the packaging.  The razor comes in a tiny clamshell carrying case that has a snap-in holder for the razor and a vented bottom that allows for super fast drying and it&#x27;s a plus because your razor isn&#x27;t sitting it water getting gross and full of bacteria.  This is made with disposable razor heads so, you keep the handle and the carrying case when you need to replace the blade.  You take the blade off and replace it in the exact same way that you do with the full size version.  I really like that it comes with the Embrace razor head because I have super sensitive skin and dry skin and these heads really make for a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really worried about the razor being hard to use or me using too much pressure when shaving.  When the handle is longer, it&#x27;s easier for me to shave faster without worrying about cuts.  It&#x27;s not the easiest thing to work with because the handle is so small.  I felt like I was going to slip and cut myself because with the handle being so small and it being wet and my hands being wet, I couldn&#x27;t get a very good grip on it and what I was doing.  I kept finding myself also touching up against the blade release which had me scared that I was going to pop it off.  By the end of the second leg, I was getting more used to the way I needed to hold it and everything but it was still kind of awkward.  The blade was nice though, Venus blades always are, imo.  All in all, close clean shave with no nicks or cuts, I just wish I would have felt more stable with it in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I really like it.  If you travel a lot or live in a dorm or you have a roommate situation going on where you like to keep things like your razor away from other people (blades are expensive) oooor If you just have a super small shower and want to save on space, then I would recommend it.  I personally don&#x27;t travel a lot and I always shave my legs in my own shower and my boyfriend never bothers my razor so, I have no real NEED for it.  The price is around $10 depending on where you go and the replacement blades can get a little expensive, some even around $15-$20.  Are the blades worth it?  Imo, yes.  I like them and they make for a smooth and easy shave.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Venus Snap is soooo cute and tiny. It helps get to small places that some regular razors can&#x27;t get too.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Venus Snap with Embrace is a great product and I definitely recommend it to everyone (especially mommas and business women on the go)!!! Working in the pharmacy field and being a momma-to-be my life is full of random craziness. This razor definitely comes in handy since it fits perfectly in my purse. No more oopsies or &amp;#34;I forgot to shave&amp;#34; moments for me!!! :)</li>
    <li> I love the Gillette Venus Snap razor! It is very tiny, light weight and leaves a smooth shave and fits in your purse! Thanks to Influenster for giving me a free one to try.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! It&#x27;s a definite must have for the summer. I love that all you have to do is wet the blade and go from there! No shaving cream or gel needed! What&#x27;s even better is that it is so compact and lightweight! Easy to carry around in your purse! Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> i love this razor it&#x27;s so small and cute. It&#x27;s small enough to put in your purse with out it taking up to much room. i also love the blue case that comes with it</li>
    <li> i Received the venus snap from influenster for testing, and i love it! Its perfect for when you are on the go, and can fit perfectly into make up bags or purses! Not to mention how great my skin feels after using it! The blades make everything so smooth! Id give it ten stars!</li>
    <li> instead of caring around cheap plastic long razors in your bag that you lost the cover to , you have this. this little razor is so convenient. its small and can fit in your bag not taking up room. it even comes in a little traveling case that has ventilation holes at the bottom so water doesn&#x27;t stay in and it can breathe and not get musty. the grip is good to have at the handle so it doesn&#x27;t slip while using it. and the gel is great leaving a nice smooth finish. i would recommend this too a friend that travels at lot and doesn&#x27;t want products to take up a lot of space int heir bag. this is just a nice cute little razor all ladies should have in hand.</li>
    <li> Razor itself is so so.. it&#x27;s the type of razor you&#x27;ll get one good shave out of.. but I&#x27;m still giving it a 4 because the size and little case are perfect for travel!! I took this on vaca and loved it.!</li>
    <li> Disposable razors are never as good as our razors we use at home. Finally there is a compact razor that is wonderful! No mess container.</li>
    <li> There are so many times where I wish I had a razor that would fit in my purse and was compact. The Venus Snap&#x27;s travel case is small (about the size of a retainer case) and very convenient for tossing into a bag (purse, gym bage, etc.). The small handle is comfortable and easy to use, and the razor uses any refillable Venus cartridge... i love that part. This is a must have for women on the go!</li>
    <li> Love the compact travel friendly razor! Its perfect for on the go, and really easy to hold! Big fan! Definitely will repurchase!</li>
    <li> The razor is perfect for travel!! The case helps keep the razor safe and away from ripping anything in your purse or travel bag. The size is still perfect for shaving and very flexible. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I received this razor complimentary of influenster. Let me start by saying that this is a great razor because of the fact that it is portable and fits anywhere. It can go in your purse or gym bag. You name it and it fits. Left my legs feeling super smooth.</li>
    <li> Love it! The only thing is the tiny handle. It&#x27;s kind of hard to get used to haha. But very convenient for trips!</li>
    <li> Portable stylish mini hand razor. Complimentary from influenster! These are perfect for on the go busy active lifestyles! Easy to use  just dip n water and it comes with its own compact to store in. its a have to care in my bag!! these don&#x27;t take much space easy to store  . #inasnap #onthego #venussnaps</li>
    <li> Was great to take on vacation as it took up barely any room and that&#x27;s great as I have a tendency to overpack. The case was great as water couldn&#x27;t stay in it and I loved the little grip on the handle.</li>
    <li> I loved this product right away! I received it in a voxbox complimentary of Influenster. I love that the carrying case is included and the 5 blades make it a great razor!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved the Snap! I travel a lot and some way or another I either loose or break my razors. The snap, with its size and case, prevents that from happening. Its convenient and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small handle was surprisingly easy to hold and use. The actual Razor was great too. 5 blades surrounded by the awesome water activated moisture strip leaves legs and underarms super smooth. Even after 2 days my legs are still smooth and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an absolutely recommend  product for everyday and long distance travel.</li>
    <li> I really like the ease of traveling with this razor. It gets a good close shave. The case is great for throwing in a bag. The only part I do not like is that the head is rather large and hard to get the bikini area as well with.</li>
    <li> I received my Gillette Venus Snap razor from influenster to test. At first I was intimidated by the small size, because I have larger hands. Let me tell you, it&#x27;s super easy to control, light weight, and the slip grip makes it so easy to use in or out of the shower. It fits perfectly in my purse or over night travel bag. I love that it has a carrying case, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about reaching into my bag and getting a nick or cut like I have before. The blade is amazing, and I only have to shave every other day, opposed to every day like I was doing before! I am now SOLD on Gillette Venus razors for LIFE!!!!</li>
    <li> I received this from Influenster to review and love everything about it. It&#x27;s tiny, comes with a little case, and all you need to use it is water.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used. I don&#x27;t have any nics or cuts or burns. It&#x27;s great or on the go, but I would buy the full size razor if I want to get all the hair.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm and is perfect for traveling.Definitely recommend buying this item. Easy to use and very compact you can easily take this with you on any travels you have planned..</li>
    <li> I received my venus snap with embrace complimentary from influenster.  It works very well, leaves your legs feeling silky smooth. Comes in a convenient little case  which makes it easy for travel.&lt;br /&gt;I liked everything about this razor except the handle, I know it is small for a reason but I kept feeling like it was going to slip out of my hand.&lt;br /&gt;But all in all a great razor!</li>
    <li> I love the Gillette Venus Snap razor. Its great for travel. I love that you don&#x27;t have to get it wet before shaving. It gives you a close shave and the handle allows for a comfortable grip.</li>
    <li> Perfect for on the go and it fits anywhere. Keeping it in my work bag for those just in case times!</li>
    <li> I love the razor its self.  It&#x27;s small and I can take it where I need to.  I&#x27;m going to wedding in two weeks and in case i miss a spot I will have this with me. I used it the other week for a quick shave before I went to work and I was not crazy about the razor head.  I hope I can use a different venus head because it was so slippery and I felt like I did not get a close enough shave.  All in all it&#x27;s a good concept and I love the size but the razor head is not the best.</li>
    <li> I received this complementary sample from Influenster and I really do enjoy this product. Although, seeing the price here I would be a little bit hesistant simply because its 9$ for one razor. However, the pros do outweight the cons because you get a carrying case for the razor that is slightly larger than a compact. The carrying case has some holes near the resting bottom of the razor to allow drainage in case you put the razor in wet. The cons I have noticed is that it is a little hard to maneuver behind the knee because of how little the grip is. The use for this is meant for &amp;#34;on the go&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;touch ups&amp;#34; so its perfect for that usage, but if you plan on using it for a full shave; I highly suggest using a full size razor that is easier to maneuver.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have ever used for travel. It is small, compact, and the case has &amp;#34;drainage holes&amp;#34; so your travel bag does not get wet. This razor offers a smooth close shave and is the perfect size and shape to hold and use comfortably.</li>
    <li> I Absolutely Love the new Venus Snap, I was skeptical at first because it&#x27;s not a full sized Razor so i assumed it wouldn&#x27;t give me that close shave, but i was wrong! I love the fact that it&#x27;s compact because i can take it anywhere with me, especially when i miss a spot here and there, because we all hate when this happens! but with this i now have no worries! great product Gillette! #InASnap #GotitFree @Influenster</li>
    <li> I love the size for traveling! It gives a great shave which is surprising for it being so small. I take this with me everywhere I go.</li>
    <li> I recently recieved the Gillette Venus Snap with Embrace in the mail from Influenster. It was so cute, I&#x27;ve never seen such a small razor!! What I love about it: I can pop it in my purse and can use it anywhere. I&#x27;m always in the car and see a spot I missed on my leg so this comes in handy. The only con is that I cant use it everytime I shave because of the fact it is so small.</li>
    <li> OK, so I got this from Influenster for review purposes and I was excited to try it out. I am going on a trip soon and wanted a razor that was portable. This is exactly it. It&#x27;s small and portable and it gets the job done, however, my 4 blade razor does closer shave than this 5 blade razor. I do not know if it is because of the small handle or the lotion bar on the razor but it is a bit annoying. I felt like I had to shave more often because of it. In addition, make sure that the razor is dry before you store it otherwise it will goop all over the case. Is it good for travel? Yes, it has a few kinks and could be done better.</li>
    <li> This was meant for travel but it&#x27;s pretty big and takes up a lot more room in a purse than a regular razor.  It&#x27;s also hard to maneuver with since the handle is something I&#x27;m not quite used to yet since it&#x27;s short, flat, and wide.  However, it does give me a close shave and I didn&#x27;t experience any razor burn, which I usually get when I don&#x27;t use shaving cream.  So as something to shave with, it&#x27;s perfect!  As something to travel with, not so great.  It was fun trying out this new product though thanks to Influenster!</li>
    <li> I received my Venus Snap complimentary from Influenster. I loved how simple it is to use. No messy creams and I also didn&#x27;t have any razor cuts. My legs were flawless for my night out after using this razor :)</li>
    <li> I got this razor from Influenster for free, to try out &amp; review! I have to say at first I was like &#x27;ugh, I love my razor I have now&#x27; but after trying this one out, I love it! Close, clean shave AND it&#x27;s small and portable! I&#x27;d highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> This razor is fantastic, works great! It is so compact i will be bringing it when i travel to my wedding! I would certainly advise anyone to buy this</li>
    <li> I loved this razor it&#x27;s great for on the go it worked well and it didn&#x27;t cut me or leave razor burn!</li>
    <li> What a great easy small travel razor, it&#x27;s perfect for on the go! Get the same shave at home and on the go. Love it</li>
    <li> The portable nature of this little razor does not take away from the fact that it is a great way to keep your body hair in check! Whether you are at the gym and need a quick trim, or shaved in the shower and realize while you&#x27;re out that you missed a spot, this Venus razor is the perfect purse or travel bag companion!</li>
    <li> I received this razor from influenster and i&#x27;m so excited! The razor is so compact and little. It&#x27;s perfect for vacations and traveling. I like the sturdy case and it has holes in the back so it can dry after you use it. Its a very nice idea. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I like this razor because you can use it on the go and it is small enough to fit in your purse. I&#x27;m not a fan of shaving without soap though, it may be my skin type but it drys out my skin no matter how much water I use. It did not say whether to let it air dry to use a rag after shaving but I used a rag, maybe I just wiped off the lotion that is on the top of the razor. No matter what though I still think its a nice in a pinch razor, maybe just not to do your whole leg</li>
    <li> This razor claims to fit easily into a purse or gym bag, provide a close, smooth shave and have an easy to grip handle. Based off of these claims I can say that this razor does what it claims to do. It is small enough for on the go and the case it comes in is very convenient, to use it you only need water. Although the shave could have been a little smoother, I would definitely buy it if I needed a travel sized razor while I&#x27;m traveling or on a tight schedule.&lt;br /&gt;I also received this product from Influenster for testing purposes</li>
    <li> I love this mini razor! It works great, its handy and easy and is great for on the go! I use this all the time! I recommend to everyone. Its affordable as well.</li>
    <li> I was given this to test by influenster complimentary!!!&lt;br /&gt;I just love this thing! It&#x27;s cute and it&#x27;s possible it&#x27;s just in my head but I find it a lot easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any cute or miss large spots on my leg. You&#x27;re more in control with pressure and area then the regular sized razor. I love this thing so much they I&#x27;m buying backup!</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Influenster for review. All thoughts and opinions are my own honest thoughts about this product. I really enjoyed this little razor. First off, the packaging is very cute. The razor looks like a pearl hidden in an oyster shell. The travel case is very helpful for trips or vacations where you want to bring your razor with you. The razor itself is very cute too. The smallness of the razor doesn&#x27;t inhibit shaving either. The Embrace blades offer a nice shave and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin which can be very sensitive and easily dried out. I&#x27;m very pleased with this little razor. The only con I have is that the refill blades can be so expensive. I might buy another razor or more products from Gillette Venus in the future.&lt;br /&gt; I WAS NOT COMPENSATED FOR THIS POST, HOWEVER I DID RECEIVE A SAMPLE FOR MY REVIEW.  ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN AND NOT INFLUENCED IN ANY WAY.</li>
    <li> I really liked this! It was really handy and compact. I would only use this if I had to be somewhere in a jiff, or away from my home/shower. However, like someone previously said, you have to go over the area more than once to get it really smooth, but it still did the job. It&#x27;s definitely something I would keep in a travel purse, but wouldn&#x27;t use for an actual shave.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Influenster for testing purposes, and I have to say, I love this razor more than I originally thought I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is pretty amazing. I mean, I&#x27;ve had Venus razors before, and I usually don&#x27;t really like the ones with five blades because they don&#x27;t get very close, or anything like that. This one did. It got super close and the shave actually lasted about a day longer than my normal shave does! I was amazed, and I&#x27;m in love with this razor!</li>
    <li> The Venus Snap is an easy and convenient razor, especially in a hurry when on the go. I received mine complimentary from Influenster and immediately gave it a go. It gave me a close shave without any painful or irritating razor burn later. My legs were extremely smooth afterwards and I&#x27;d definitely buy this in the future.</li>
    <li> This razor is so cute! I received it complimentarily from influenster for testing purposes &amp; defiantly was pleasantly surprised. I thought it was kind of silly but the case &amp; gliding gel strips makes it travel friendly for sure. I will be using this all the time wether for trips or even at home.</li>
    <li> i received this product complimentary of Influenster for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;the razor it self is a very nice razor. Gillette normally has great razors and im pretty impressed most of the time. With the snap, i am also impressed. It may be small but they didnt skip out on quality. Its very convenient to take with you on the travel. The price is the only thing that does not make this 5 stars. im not looking to spend 10 dollars for a travel size razor. other then that, its a great razor and works like a normal size one.</li>
    <li> I loved this because its portable. And I often miss spots. And it comes with a nice little case and you can just use it wherever. It&#x27;s great for those of us who miss spots often. I got this via influenster.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Influenster. I really love how it has five blades on it. I have used this razor multiple times and I will definitely be buying this soon. It really gives me that close shave that I want, that my other razors fail to do. I recommend this for the summer time or when you just want to get a good shave for whatever reason.</li>
    <li> I love how close of a shave this razor gives and I also love that&#x27;s it&#x27;s small and portable. It leaves shaved area smooth and I love it. Great product!!! Thanks influenster!!</li>
    <li> I was given this razor through the company Influenster to try and I must say it has now become my go to razor. I was first unsure of its size, but it works great and has not caused me any problems. I find the the pink rubber part of the handle can be very slippery if shaving while showering, but that would be my only small complaint. I LOVE IT AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT!</li>
    <li> I enjoy the benefits of being an Influenster-- getting various complimentary products to use and share my opinions with others. My newest acquisition is Gillette’s Venus Snap with Embrace. This product has the perks of being compactly encased for perfect portability. I can fit this light little razor into any purse, beach tote, or duffel bag with room to spare. It does have a few drawbacks though—the size, while great saver of storage space, causes it to be tricky to handle during a shave. I didn’t nick myself or anything, but it just felt awkward. I also did not think about the moisture that would incur in the case after the shave. Even with the holes in the case, there is still a collection of moisture that makes things a little damp. Tip: Just make sure to dab it dry before returning it to its case. Overall, I do like the product. I am starting to get comfortable with its handle and I love how well it fits with my other purse population. I recommend this product to anyone with a smooth on-the-go lifestyle.</li>
    <li> I injured my upper arm a few years ago and have had a difficult time shaving my underarms. The length of the handle gives me more control, allowing me to get a complete close shave.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I got it just in time for a camping trip at the beach, and it was wonderful to have! Perfect size, and it made my legs so smooth with no irritation.</li>
    <li> I love love love this tiny little razor! I got it just in time for camping season. It fits perfectly in my bag with its little case and I don&#x27;t have to worry that it&#x27;ll get lost. It gives a perfect shave and is easy to use!</li>
    <li> I am still on the fence about this snap razor. i absolutely love how small it is, fits perfectly in my bag. perfect for a quick shave before a date, and absolutely perfect for traveling and camping (i go camping a lot)  the only thing i&#x27;m not too fond of is the handle. its just not what im used to. the first time using it i nicked myself more than once because the handle kept slipping out of my hands. it&#x27;s just awkward for me. i gave the venus snap a 3 star review because the idea is awesome, (too bad we cant bring razors on carry on) and the razor it self give you a nice shave. i just did not like the handle, but im sure i can get used to it.</li>
    <li> I thought this product wouldn&#x27;t work. But I was very surprised when it worked great! I have recommended it to everyone! I got this product from influenster and I&#x27;m so thankful! It doesn&#x27;t leave razer burn or irritation. It&#x27;s perfect</li>
    <li> I was really excited when I heard I had been selected to be one of the product testers for this Gillette Venus Snap razor. I have been on an air &amp; road trip across the country for the past two and a half weeks so it was perfect timing. I had to make sure I brought everything I&#x27;d need for the hot and humid weather out East and be able to fit it all in one suitcase since airlines are ridiculous now and charge you extra fees for wanting to not wear the same change of clothes wherever you&#x27;re going. This Snap razor was perfect - I didn&#x27;t need soap or shaving cream, all I needed to do was throw the mini razor (and accompanying mini carrying case) on my toiletry bag and I was good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be the first to admit I&#x27;m sometimes a cheapo when it comes to shopping for toiletries. I&#x27;m pretty low maintenance so I usually go for the store brand / off brand / whatever is on sale and cheap brand and sometimes it backfires. This Venus razor was awesome and way outperformed the Up&amp;Up target brand razor I was previously using.&lt;br /&gt;Because the soap is built in, you get a very smooth run, and gave me an incredibly close shave. My knees are usually my trouble spot (and if I&#x27;m honest, a lot of times I just give up and skip over them - yikes!) but with the flexible head on this razor, it was much easier to navigate over them without sacrificing the quality of the shave. Another pro is that it comes with a little carrying case, which prevents the razor from ruining whatever bag it&#x27;s put in, while also keeping the blades from dulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I have encountered so far is that the razor is kind of awkward to hold because of the short handle. However, the handle is supposed to be short so that it&#x27;s a more convenient size and can slip into any bag, so it&#x27;s kind of a give and take. They did try to combat the awkward hold with a grippy area so the handle at least won&#x27;t slip out of your grip, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great razor! I&#x27;m definitely going to be switching to Venus in general, but now I also have an option for the many trips we have planned for the rest of the year. The Gillette Venus Snap razor not only does what it claims to do, leaving you with a silky smooth finish, but it also gives you a super cute product that you won&#x27;t be embarrassed to tote around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product for testing purposes, complimentary from Influenster.ly going to be switching to Venus in general, but now I also have an option for the many trips we have planned for the rest of the year.

    <li> I received a sample of this razor from Influenster and was excited to try something new. I do like it and it does all it says it will: you can take it on the go and use without soap &amp; water, it gives a close, smooth finish. However, I can&#x27;t see myself shelling out the money to replace the razors down the road, I wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive (I am one of those disposable razor kind of gals). Also the handle was something different to get used to, I had never used a short-handled razor before and I kept feeling like I couldn&#x27;t get a good grip of I was going to drop it. Overall I love the concept &amp; it&#x27;s a good product but I can&#x27;t see myself repurchasing at this point...maybe for vacations or special occasions only where I may need a razor on the go.</li>
    <li> Great idea to have a good razor with you on vacation!. I never have anywhere to put my razors! The handle is decent for what it is. Makes it very easy to take with you especially when your on the go and works well!</li>
    <li> I love this razor, it&#x27;s easy to carry around and works great! I&#x27;m glad they included a case so you can leave it in your purse for quick touchups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this free for testing purposes from Influenster.</li>
    <li> Note: I received this complimentary from Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already shave using only water, so I was excited to try out a product designed to be used without shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor gave me a very close shave for my legs and my underarms. While I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any faster than my other razors have been, the small and flexible design made it easier to shave my knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only concern I have is the price point. The refill blades cost a lot more money than I normally spend on razors. I will probably limit my use to travel only, when I&#x27;m willing to pay for the convenience of a small razor in a handy carrying case.</li>
    <li> I love the packaging on this product and I was excited to use it for a recent vacation. I threw it in my suitcase and was excited to use it. Fast-forward a few days in, its time to touch up my legs for the pools and I whipped out my cute little travel razor (seriously, Gillette, cutest packaging ever), I soaped up and OUCH - I could immediately tell that the quality and sharpness of the razors was not OK. I loved the way the razor handle fit in my hand and I loved how easy it was to pack into my suitcase, but I did not get a close enough shave, and when I did it took up a little skin too. The quality of the blades just dont match the product.</li>
    <li> I got this free from influenster!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah, the feeling of freshly shaved, smooth legs is wonderful- until you find out you missed a spot. F!*#!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t worry, Gillette Venus has made the perfect on-the-go razor for that stubborn stubble. The Snap razor is this teeny tiny adorable little razor that fits perfectly in a blue portable carrying case. Whether you missed a few hairs like I usually do, or perhaps you&#x27;re travelling, the Snap razor can go anywhere with you and work In a Snap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mini razor has the Venus Embrace blade refill with a mini grippy handle for better control. So if you have any Venus Embrace refills laying around, you can also use it on the Snap! It has 5 blades with a Protective Ribbon of Moisture - so just simply wet the razor and you&#x27;re good to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this razor. It&#x27;s very practical, and easy to tuck in my purse. I ALWAYS miss a few hairs, and it drives me crazy. Especially if I can see them.</li>
    <li> If we&#x27;re talking about square inches, the razor (in the case) is probably just as big, if not bigger, as other razors. I thought the razor would be really difficult to use since the handle is so short, but it was pretty easy to use. I&#x27;ve used Venus razors before and this definitely met my expectations but it&#x27;s just not worth it. I can get just as good of a shave from a walgreens 5 blade razor which is much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Veryyy convient I love this little thing! It fits in your purse, travel bag, pocket..etc! Its very unique cause its small. And it doesn&#x27;t miss a hair! I love love love it. I definitely works for me.</li>
    <li> I must say, I&#x27;ve always hated shaving because it was such a tedious task. When I first received the offer to try this product for free through Influenster, I thought the idea of an &amp;#34;on the go&amp;#34; razor was unnecessary and a somewhat useless invention....but now that I&#x27;ve tried this product I know for a fact that I will be purchasing another one. It&#x27;s great to know that when packing I can just drop my Venus Snap Razor in my bag and not worry about packing shaving cream. The flexibility of the razor allows for a close shave and although the handle appears somewhat awkward, it allows for a good grip. I&#x27;ve grown to love this product and will definitely be buying another/replacing the razor or whatever necessary to ensure that I can continue using it in the future.</li>
    <li> The new Snap with Embrace is small and great to take wherever you may need. I received the product for testing purposes from Influenster and Gillette. The blades are great, like other Venus razors, it&#x27;s a little hard to hold in the shower if you&#x27;re doing more than touch up shaving, but overall works great.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this razor! I received mine from Influenster for free for testing purposes but I would totally buy it.  Literally all you need to do is toss it in your bag and you are good to go. Just make sure you DO NOT use it dry, yes it will work but your legs will be dry, itchy and if you have sensitive skin like me some serious razor burn. Just add water and you&#x27;ll be fine. It&#x27;s so convenient and discrete, no one will even know you have a razor with you. LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> This razor is a lifesaver! It is perfect for a quick shave, especially after I&#x27;ve already gotten dressed and realize I forgot to shave! I love using it for my underarms because there no mess and it is FAST! Mine has shown to be great quality and lasted about a month for my quick shaves.</li>
    <li> This tiny little thing is PERFECT for an on-the-go woman! I know personally, I sometimes miss a spot or I feel like I need to touch up my legs if I&#x27;m wearing shorts or a dress and this is so small and discreet! The ONLY downfall is if you carry a huge purse like I do, you may be digging forever looking for this thing. Lol</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Ladies if you have a busy schedule like mine, this little guy will be your new holy grail.&lt;br /&gt;It is so portable it will fit in anything. It makes my skin feel super smooth and causes the least irritation from other razors I&#x27;ve tired.&lt;br /&gt;Great for getting rid of that stubble at the last minute.&lt;br /&gt;(Product was given to me as testing purposes through Influenster)</li>
    <li> This version of the Venus razor is a nice alternative from the everyday razor but it would never replace mine. It&#x27;s nice to keep in your beach bag or gym bag in case you discover at the last moment that you &amp;#34;oops, missed a spot.&amp;#34; They fail to advertise the fact that you still need to carry your little bottle of shaving cream, too, if it&#x27;s going to be more than a mere touch-up. I&#x27;m also worried about my little ones getting the case open, so having it out of the bathroom and in a day-bag where they could get ahold of it makes me quite nervous. I&#x27;m glad you don&#x27;t have to buy separate types of refills. That&#x27;s a plus! Overall, if you can handle the new style of handle, it&#x27;s just as wonderful as the rest of the Gillette Venus Razor Family... just this one comes with the compacted size.</li>
    <li> This razor is definitely just for touch-ups, while it is a good and close shave the short handle make it difficult to maneuver.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it myself but I sent it by influenster, which I am thankful for so I know what not to spend my money on.</li>
    <li> I received this razor complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. And it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve used to shave my legs and underarms since. It&#x27;s so easy and quick. You don&#x27;t need any shaving cream, just water, and you&#x27;ll still get that close smooth shave. I like that it came with a carrying case that helps the razor dry so it lasts longer and allows you to take it on the go. I only wish that the carrying case wasn&#x27;t as bulky and the handle allowed for better grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone who likes a quick shave, are constantly on the go, or accidentally misses spots.</li>
    <li> ***I received the Venus Snap plus Embrace complimentary from Influenster for reviewing purposes. All opinions expressed are my own***&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, when I first saw pictures of this razor online I was not quite sure just how comfortable it is to use because the handle looks so short but to my surprise, it was not hard to control at all. The Venus Snap provides a really close, smooth shave and glides over my skin easily just like I&#x27;m used to from the regular size Gillette Venus razors. The handle is very &amp;#34;squishy&amp;#34; and kind of rubbery which diminishes the risk of slipping and cutting yourself. In fact, I have never had a cut or nick using any Gillette Venus razor. This particular one comes in a little hard plastic travel case with tiny holes in it -perfect to just toss in your purse, gym bag or if you&#x27;re a mommy, it can even safely go into the side compartment of a diaper bag, which is perfect for me. No more stray hairs at the swimming pool, barbecue or anywhere!! The blades are the same ones you use in the &amp;#34;full size&amp;#34; razors, which is a huge plus. I recommend the Venus Snap to anyone who is as forgetful and busy as I am and every once in a while notices one of these little patches of survivor stray hair after leaving the house :) I would give it 5 stars if it was just a little bit more affordable! #InASnap #GilletteVenus</li>
    <li> I was sent this razor to test via Influenster (thanks!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not the type of person who lives a lifestyle where I would need to shave my legs on the go (how do you even do that, do you just like find the nearest sink or something?). Other than the obvious confusion as to why someone would need an on the go razor, I could possibly see people using this that commute from the gym to work. If you are showering and then heading off to work and you aren&#x27;t at home it would make sense to have a small compact razor. Other than that, I have no idea who would need this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I give it 3 stars: It is a Gillette Venus razor which is great on its own without the on-the-go use features.&lt;br /&gt;I also only gave it 3 stars because I have to use this razor with shave cream, even though it says you just need water. I used it with just water and broke out in hives because the formula on the razor directly against my skin somehow promoted a reaction. (sensitive skin problems).</li>
    <li> I love my Venus® Snap with Embrace! It is perfect for travel and on the go. I love the little case it comes in because it is easy to throw in my purse and go. I no longer have to worry about needing to shave, I can do it anywhere, and I&#x27;m hooked! I am so thankful Venus® sent me one to try! I will never buy a razor that isn&#x27;t Venus®.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved Gillette Venus Snap! I received this razor complementary from Influenster, It has the same power as the Gillette Venus regular size but so convenient for on the go! it leaves my skin very soft and smooth. I loved how small it is, as well as the case where you can save it. It is truly perfect for this summer season. It has 5 blades which is amazing for the size of this razor. I don&#x27;t have nothing but good things to tell you about this razor. I did not find any cons. It is so amazing to keep it in your purse all the time. I really enjoy using it and I totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> i bought this razor because the it looks very nice and different upon presentation. I also needs a small razor to carry with me in a 5-week trip this summer so i just want to give it a try a few weeks before the trip. It is amazing. the small handle is kind of hard to use at first but now it is amazing. I think it&#x27;s actually easier to use in the shower than the traditional one. Strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I got mine through Influenster in a vox box. I absolutely love this thing because it&#x27;s so compact and so easy to just throw in a bag. Perfect for camping or travel. I also love the blue case that comes with it because it lets the razor dry instead of getting wet and staying wet. I would definatly recommend this razor!</li>
    <li> I got this razor from Influenster in my Venus Snap VoxBox. It&#x27;s a cute little razor and it&#x27;s great just to pop in your purse if your going to be running around all day. I like that they have it in an adorable little case as well so you don&#x27;t get cut if you put it in your bag. *I got this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Influenster for testing purposes, and i must say I love it! It&#x27;s size is perfect for travelling and the 5 blazes ensure I am able to get a super smooth shave. Even though it&#x27;s small in size, it can be used for everyday shaving as well! I definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I received this complimentary from Influenster voxbox and I absolutely love it! It fits right into my gym bag and works wonderful, even without soap (causes no burns/bumps)! I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> *this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes* While I wouldn&#x27;t use this razor full-time, it&#x27;s great for quick touchups. With warmer weather coming I will definitely keep this in my purse or at my desk for those missed spots. While the handle is small, I found that the material and shape was easy to manage. I love the fact that I can just wet the blade and use without any sort of shaving gel. The 5 blades gave a close shave and left my legs feeling smooth. I highly recommend this product for the summer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always like Venus razors! The Gillette Venus Snap razor is awesome because of its small design and it&#x27;s easy to hold! I will definitely will be taking it on my honeymoon vacation in a few weeks and I will be recommending it to any of my friends and family that will be going on vacations or who are on the go a lot!!!</li>
    <li> I love this little guy! It&#x27;s compact and leaves the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with a razor. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I received a Venus snap through Influenster for testing purposes, and am thoroughly impressed! I have very sensitive skin and am no stranger to razor burn. After using this razor I have no irritation and the smoothest legs! Thanks Influenster! #InASnap</li>
    <li> As a mom, some days... most days can easily turn into a blur. I can shower, shave and get dressed, only to realizes that I missed a spot. Now that I have the Gillette Venus Snap, I can easily get what I missed and move on. I have three kids between 2 &amp; 3 years old, so time is of the essence and keeping the Venus Snap in my purse or even in the downstairs bathroom I can quickly fix the issue and move on without my kids even blinking! This is small, compact and efficient! I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I had given this shaver a 4/5 stars. I had gotten this from Influenster and I finally got to try it. It&#x27;s a pretty good shaver. It&#x27;s very convenient to travel with, if you need to travel with it. It&#x27;s discreet too. You can buy replaceable blades and I think that the grip is pretty comfortable, maybe not for those tight spaces. But definitely for legs, underarms, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a pretty neat product and gives a nice smooth shave. I would recommend this to people who travel pretty often and need a cute little shaver to use.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect razor! It&#x27;s small and compact enough to stick in my suitcase when I travel (and that happens A LOT over the summer.) Glides over my legs without nicking me and it&#x27;s CUTE! Very satisfied with this razor and would definitely recommend. Thanks, Influenster, for letting me test this razor complementary!</li>
    <li> i like this product soooo sooooooooo soooooooooooooo much. first off, its portable, second its cute and i love it lolllll</li>
    <li> I received this complimentary from Influenster, and I&#x27;m so happy that I was selected to receive this. I gave me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. The handle was easy to hold, and I could tell if I was missing any spots as I shaved, because of the handle being so small. It&#x27;s also great for sensitive skin, like mine. Along with the little traveling case it comes with, this is an absolutely amazing product, and I&#x27;d definitely suggest purchasing one, especially if you travel a lot, and hate having to pack a bigger razor.</li>
    <li> I received this for testing and review complements of Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that the size is perfect for travel. The handle is nice and has that flexible center. I like the shaving head, but I don&#x27;t recommend using just the razor and water. I did a comparison test with my left leg only using the razor+ water and the right using shaving cream. The left leg had many more shaving bumps than the right. I had even used lotion afterwards. So, unless you&#x27;re desperately in need of a shave and don&#x27;t care about the consequences, use some shaving cream or be careful with your razor movements.</li>
    <li> Influenster gave me the honor to test the Venus Snap Razor beyond being excited to try something new and different for influenster I am completely satisfied by my new Razor! I love the convenience and how the razor left my skin smooth and clear of hair!  This razor is incredibly amazing I love that I can leave it in my purse and use it whenever.</li>
    <li> I LOVE my Gillette Snap. It is so small but performs like a full size razor. The 5 blades provide a smooth close shave. I have a 1 year old that likes to go into my purse, so having the on-the-go case is so nice to protect her while I keep it in my purse for emergencies!</li>
    <li> I received this complimentary of Influenster for testing purposes and I must say I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed. When I opened the box I thought to myself, &amp;#34;What in the world am I gonna do with this mini razor.&amp;#34; But, it surprised me and proved that it can stand tall with it&#x27;s competitors. The convenience of it is great, easy to slip in a bag and take with you on the go and the shave itself is outstanding as well!</li>
    <li> I love a lot of things about this razor. I love how cute and compact it is - perfect fit for the purse (just in case you realize you miss a spot!) I love the squishy grip handle. I love the smooth shave. I love that it uses Venus blades so I can keep reusing it. The case is also great and has a vent so it can dry inside the case. Finally, I LOVE that it was free from Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought it otherwise since it&#x27;s pricey for such a small razor. But now that I have it, I&#x27;ll definitely put it to good use! Thanks Influenster and Venus!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.  I was a little skeptical at first due to the size of the handle.  I didn&#x27;t think it would be comfortable, but it really was.  I love the close shave I get when using Gillette Venus products and now that I can safely take it while traveling makes my traveling much easier! I cannot wait to take it to Jamaica with me later in June!!!</li>
    <li> I got this razor free from Influenster to test out. I took it on a camping trip this weekend and I really like it for traveling purposes. It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space and it comes in a carrying case so I don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting myself when I look for it in my bag. Overall I really recommend this for people who travel a lot.</li>
    <li> I think this razor is a cute idea and practical to keep in a purse for those \\&quot;oops I missed a spot\\&quot; moments. Received compliments of Influenster :)</li>
    <li> I love this razor! is small and can go anywhere with me. i love the blades and moveable head that can move when u are shaving on knees.its easy to hold. i recommend for anyone going on a trip or for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Like others have said, it&#x27;s a great Venus razor, the handle is definitely tricky! Love the compactness of it though, and for the purpose of traveling I can overlook the awkward handle. Thanks to influenster for the trial!</li>
    <li> I received this razor complimentary from my influenster box. It is a great product for on the go or traveling. The handle is small which makes it great to pack or tuck away for a weekend get away. Shaves great! #inasnap</li>
    <li> Gillette Venus is my favorite razor brand and I love how cute and convenient the new venus snap razor is. I love that it is self lathering and that the case has vents so the water doesn&#x27;t get grimy! I would buy this product again and again, especially for quick work/pleasure trips.</li>
    <li> I love the compact case and razor it&#x27;s perfect for traveling and on the go I keep mine in my purse! I love Venus razor though nice sleek doesn&#x27;t cut you at all it&#x27;s fabulous</li>
    <li> This razor is awesome. It offers a close shave, leaving very smooth skin. It is so compact that it&#x27;s perfect for travel. It works fantastic around areas such as knees and ankles and I have not had a cut since I started using it. An awesome product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Gillette Venus razors, it&#x27;s my go-to razor. So when I heard I was going to get to try the Gillette Venus Snap with Embrace courtesy Influenster, I was ecstatic! I love the carrying case it came in and it&#x27;s so compact, it fit perfectly in my make up case. I loved that the head of the razor was regular size and it moves to get those hard to reach spots. It works just as good as the full size but now you can take it with you on the go! So happy to have a chance to try this and it&#x27;s definitely something I will keep using all summer long!</li>
    <li> Absolutely IN LOVE with this little suckers! Best invention ever!! It fits perfect in my gym bag and not only is it adorable but it works perfectly! Buy it, buy it now!!!</li>
    <li> Finally, a GOOD compact travel razor! I can&#x27;t stand disposables, and it&#x27;s always a hassle taking the full size and putting it in the plastic baggie. This comes with it&#x27;s own compact case. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this razor! it comes in handy! and the best part is that it fits in your pocket! It also leaves my skin very smooth!</li>
    <li> I travel a lot and this razor is great to take on the road with me. It is easy to throw in a bag and is also a great razor to boot! My only complaint is that it is a little difficult to use the short handle, but the grippy circle makes it easier.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised! When I first used it I sat at the kitchen table and had a cup of water and occasionally dipped the razor in it as I shaved. Obviously I got razor burn and it hurt so bad. But I discovered that constantly keeping the razor wet while shaving will give you a smooth experience! I love it now and it has replaced my traditional razor. A great product that I will be purchasing more of in the future!!</li>
    <li> This snap to go razor is amazing it is so small and compact you can take it anywhere and it fits anywhere. To a sleep over or on vacation where ever it is the to go razor is always by your side!!!</li>
    <li> I received this razor complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. So far I love it! It&#x27;s tiny enough to fit in the small amount of space I have left in my purse. I also take it with on trips to visit in-laws. It shaves clean and well. Don&#x27;t have to worry if I missed a spot shaving now because this is always in my purse!</li>
    <li> I received my Gillette Venus Snap with Embrace complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster in my Venus Snap VoxBox, and let me start with the fact that I absolutely love it! I seem to be in a constant search for the perfect razor that gives me a truly close shave without razor burn for everyday use at home, let alone for on the go! I have definitely found my solace in the Gillette Venus Snap and Gillette Venus Embrace. The Venus Snap is absolutely awesome for on the go use (and as a twenty-something college student this is key in my life), no razor burn, convenient size, and a mess-free carrying case for shaving ‪#‎InASnap‬. I am definitely sold on this product, and would recommend it to others! Getting this product in the mail encouraged me to look into the full size Venus Embrace for at-home use, and I had a very similar positive experience here...great shave, no razor burn, easy to find in stores! I am definitely an avid Gillette Venus Embrace user from here on out. Thanks Influenster and Gillette Venus!</li>
    <li> I love this little thing!! It fit in my purse so easily. Also you don&#x27;t need any shaving cream so you can really shave anywhere,from school to a wedding.It is so helpful for those days when you forget to shave your legs.I love this product</li>
    <li> Have you ever been on a date and looked at the sun glistening off of those KNEE hairs you missed?!?!?! This will help you resolve this issue! Take a &amp;#34;rest stop&amp;#34; and make your missed spots disappear! I LOVE this razor! Close shave too!!</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of this razor. I love the neat carrying case that protects the moisture strip on the head of the razor. It&#x27;s easily the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. The 5 blade head on it absolutely fantastic. I love my razor!</li>
    <li> Only got a 4 from me because the ejection button kept getting in the way. My fault but though I&#x27;d point it out.</li>
    <li> Good size for travel. Nice sharp blade and flexible. Can&#x27;t say much about price since I got this free from influenster. I like how it came with a case. However, it&#x27;s rather difficult to clean.</li>
    <li> I opened and thought &amp;#34;ah! how cute!&amp;#34; It is the perfect size for travel or even to throw in your bag for emergency primping. It also works great!</li>
    <li> The blade that comes with the razor is great, but it&#x27;s just the same as any other Venus Embrace razor as far as I know.  The container and the razor handle itself are cute and make it nice and convenient to travel with; however it easily slips out of my grip when I&#x27;m using it in the shower, and the release button is located in a place that makes it precarious to get a better grip on without releasing the blade.  Overall, I&#x27;m enjoying getting a close shave and it fits on the smaller shelf in my shower so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor! I received it courtesy of Influenster, and it is perfect for on the go! It is a great size when traveling on vacation. Also, I love that you can change the razor blades so it is reusable! I love it!</li>
    <li> This is so cute. it fits in your hand and it make it easy to pack. This is very good for travel or when someone is on the go. It also leaves my legs smooth. I love it!</li>
    <li> I received this razor complimentary from influenster to test it out.  I tell the truth, at first it was hard to use because it is so tiny.  But after a couple of uses it gets easier to hold.  I love the ease in which the blade goes over your skin, either with or without shaving cream.  I plan on buying a second one for my gym bag, as I love the one I have, and use it in my home shower!</li>
    <li> This razor is small and cute. Comes with a compact, great for a weekend getaway or vacation. Other than that, it&#x27;s the same as any other razor</li>
    <li> It was easy to use and super convenient.  It works well for traveling, and leaves a nice, smooth, clean shave!</li>
    <li> I love the grip of this compact razor! It is easy to use and gives a smooth shave. The compact case and size allows me to carry a razor around all day!. You never know when you might find a spot you missed while in the shower! I agree that, with this razor, all I have to do is wet it, shave and go about my day! If you are always on the go and sometimes forget to shave, this razor is definitely for you.&lt;br /&gt;I believe the Venus Snap razor is the leading edge product in women&#x27;s razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received the Gillette Venus Snap from Influenster for testing and review purposes.</li>
    <li> I love trying new products! It&#x27;s so fun to try something for the first time and decide whether it is going to be a staple item in your life, or if it&#x27;s a one time thing. And let me tell you this little nugget of perfection (A.K.A the razor shown above) is definitely going to be a staple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never really spent much time or paid much attention to shaving my legs. It&#x27;s just something I have to do and I simply get it done. I usually a buy a store brand disposable razor and don&#x27;t think anything of it. Which is probably why I made a bit of a mistake when trying this product. I didn&#x27;t realize that this razor is only supposed to be for &amp;#34;spot treating.&amp;#34; So I opened the package, lathered up my legs, and tried to shave EVERYTHING (on my legs that is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I dried off and looked down to inspect the work it had done, I was very disappointed. My legs still had hair in some places and the shave wasn&#x27;t very close. So I went back to the package and started to read (yes, I performed this task in backwards fashion). I had done two things wrong. 1) I had used shaving cream when you&#x27;re supposed to shave dry. The razor has a built in soap distribution and so I was defeating that purpose and coating my legs with too much &amp;#34;gunk.&amp;#34; 2) I had tried to shave my whole leg. This razor is only meant for correcting a small area that needs to be shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I realized what I had done, I went back a few days later and shaved only a few spots and it worked MAGIC! There was no hair left and the shave was very close. I love that you only have to wet the razor for it to work. I didn&#x27;t get blotchy skin, irritation, itching, NOTHING (I sometimes get all of the above due to my sensitive skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is an amazing little tool. It&#x27;s lightweight, small, easy to carry, easily fits in your purse. It&#x27;s definitely a summer staple!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I travel quite a bit and always find that the regular razors are very awkward to pack and if I&#x27;m only going somewhere for a weekend I will put up with stubble so I don&#x27;t have to pack a razor! I think this is a great product because you can still use any razor heads from Gillette Venus that you normally like to use, but you can just pop them on this little handle and go! It wasn&#x27;t hard to use the handle at all, and I love that it comes in a protective plastic case because then my razor won&#x27;t cut my travel bag (seriously, has happened before!). I would recommend this to anyone who is traveling but doesn&#x27;t want to sacrifice a good shave.</li>
    <li> I received this from influenster and I must say I am very impressed. The packaging is cute and fits anywhere which makes it even better. It glides on to your skin smoothly which is a plus.</li>
    <li> I received this razor complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.  I always expect the same result with razors but this one totally out did itself. Its not only small and fits perfectly in my bag but it gives me the best shave and long lasting one i have ever had. I went 3 days without having to shave and that is a LONG time in leg hair days hahaha. One of my favorite things is the actual case it comes with. It has built in holes so that the water drains properly and it  does not stay in and cause damage to the razor itself.  IN LOVE with the grip. Even though its a small size razor the grip is fantastic and it moves in ways that the taller ones cant. I will def be buying this product!</li>
    <li> I received the Venus In A Snap Razor free of charge from Influenster&lt;br /&gt;I love the moisture strip that makes shaving a cinch with no irritation or razor burn left behind. With the 5 blades you can get a close shave! I prefer using the Gillette Venus Embrace Snap for shaving underarms and bikini line since it is small enough to fit in those areas you would want a close shave.</li>
    <li> The Venus snap with embrace razor is the perfect on the go razor. It does take a little bit of getting used to because the handle is so small compared to a typical razor but that comfort comes along with frequent use. If you&#x27;re like me and constantly running around from place to place this is an ideal solution for someone who can&#x27;t find the time to shave. Although I most often shave in the shower it&#x27;s nice to have this as a backup. I now keep it in the glove compartment of my car along with all the other essentials. It is not too rough on your skin as long as you are sure to moisten the razor before using. The case it comes in works conveniently to hold water for this purpose. The minor difficulty I have is rinsing the razor since there isn&#x27;t always a flowing stream of water or faucet nearby but aside from that is issue, I love this being a quick fix to my shaving needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely intend to take this and only this razor with me whenever I travel from here on out. I&#x27;ve always found it annoying packing my sharp razor in with all of my other toiletries but this Venus Snap with embrace will work great and is easy to throw in my purse and carry anywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got to try this product complimentary from Influenster for testing and reviewing purposes, all opinions are my own</li>
    <li> This is such a great tool! I took it camping on a backpacking trip. Worked great for little touch ups that are needed during a weekend trip on the beach. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> So first of all i want to say i love this item more then anything ever. It is not only cute and convenient for me to carry around but also. it works wonders on my legs. Now im not just say that because i got it compliments of influenster. I am not playing when i say it works wonders i have really think hair on my legs and when i got it in the mail i was like ok there is no way i am going to really use that on the go i need to be in the shower everytime i shave my legs. But to my surprise i was able and trust me it was a big surprise that i was actually able to use this small cute gillette Venus snap with embrace with just a little bit of water when i was rushing out the door because i was late to an interview for a job and my son spilled juice on me. so i had to change to a chance on this awesome little wonder worker and it work. I could not be more happy and hooked to this cute convenient 5 blade shaver that was a life saver.</li>
    <li> I got this before I went on vacation. It is small and compact for traveling purposes. The case is perfect so I don&#x27;t cut myself grabbing inside my bag. It shaves like a regular razor from Venus. After using the Gillette razor it left no nicks/cuts and glided very smooth</li>
    <li> Thanks Influenster﻿ and Gillette Venus﻿ for the #InASnap VoxBox! I love the Venus Snap! As a girl with dark hair, fair skin, and glasses, blindly shaving in the shower has become somewhat of a nightmare! I was always finding little patches of hair I missed on my legs.throughout the day, which is a little embarrassing! I always had thought about bringing a razor with me but I always forgot or didn&#x27;t have a good place to store it, not to mention it was wet still from the shower. The Venus Snap has solved my shaving problems! It&#x27;s small and easy to carry around with the case, I just keep it in my purse so I never forget it, and now I don&#x27;t have spend my whole day worrying about my little hair patches, I can just find a bathroom and destroy them! Muahaha! I love this thing.</li>
    <li> I love this product and the closer shave that it gave.  It&#x27;s now my new shaving mate on the go and regular!</li>
    <li> This greatest thing about this razor is that it offers the use of a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; razor over a disposable but it&#x27;s travel friendly. The compact case it comes with is super cute and very handy. It was easy to throw in my travel bag. Holding it for actual use is a little awkward but you get used to it. The shave isn&#x27;t any better or worse then your typical brand razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was sent I me by influenster for testing purposes</li>
    <li> I liked the razor. It was easy to handle and assemble. I liked that it was in travel size because sometimes those big razor take up too much space.</li>
    <li> I received this razor complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I liked this razor, the 5 blades offer a very close shave without having to go over the same spots numerous times. The handle is definitely something to get used to, however, since the Venus Snap is more so meant for &amp;#34;touch ups&amp;#34; on-the-go, it doesn&#x27;t get as used on a regular basis as my regular razor. Its a very cute and practical concept, I love the case, and I love that I can pop a refill in &amp; keep the rest. For me, this razor is definitely more of a if I need something while-on-the-go its there and it works! I would definitely recommend this product for anyone with a on-the-go life style, traveling, or in your gym bag!</li>
    <li> This razor is just perfect for shaving your under arms! All the razors on the market today have the long handle which makes it hard to hold comfortably while shaving your arm pits and I always end up holding it really close to the handle and then I hit the release button and the razor head pops off. Anyway I really like the razor, however I gave it 4 stars based on the price.&lt;br /&gt;It truly is ridiculous what these companies are charging for what amounts to a tiny metal strip on a plastic handle!&lt;br /&gt;You can buy 50 razor blades at your local hardware store for $2.00! But then again I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to see my legs after trying to shave with them : ) So I guess we&#x27;re at the mercy of the razor companies unless we want to look like Amazonian women!</li>
    <li> Seriously great product. Perfect to keep in your gym bag, for last minute under arm shaves, and even in your purse</li>
    <li> Simple, and easy to use. I like that it doesn&#x27;t take up too much shelf space I&#x27;m my shower. I already liked the Venus razor, so this one is just more convenient!</li>
    <li> I love this little Venus Snap!! Not only is in compact and portable, you also get a great smooth shave from the 5-blades!</li>
    <li> I received this from Influenster and absolutely love this product! I would recommend this product to anyone going on a trip!</li>
    <li> I am seriously in love with the Venus Snap razor - it&#x27;s so easy and portable to take to the gym, on trips or even keep in my purse for just in case missed spots! I love that you can buy any removable Gillette Venus razor head to work with it so you can have it for years to come!! Looking forward to taking this to Europe with me in the summer.</li>
    <li> Small, perfect for on the go people! Perfect for ever having to shave your legs in a car! Haha done that before!</li>
    <li> Awesome razor very compact and perfect for missed hairs or shaving on the go! Will defintally be recommending to my friends!</li>
    <li> It shaves close and smooth, with no razor bumps.  However I will not use it as advertised and dry shave!</li>
    <li> This is the best travel razor I have ever used. If you aren&#x27;t near water, don&#x27;t worry; you can clean up a spot or two with no problem. I also love the longevity of the razor. You really get what you are paying for. The razor even comes with a sturdy travel case.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I received this razor for testing purposes free from Influenster)</li>
    <li> a very cute razor! I like how the travel case is perforated, and allows the shaver to dry if it gets wet. It&#x27;s very small and compact. The great thing is that it works with all the Gillette Venus blades. Personally I prefer the three blade refills, so I actually swapped the original blade provided with my own cartridge. Definitely a must-have for traveling, or for bringing to the gym.</li>
    <li> The razor is perfect! I was worried about the shape of the handle but it was easy to get a grip onto it. You can use different Gillette razor heads if you like a specific type. The case and size make it easy to travel with.</li>
    <li> So happy that Venus made this little razor for on the go use. It actually works like any other Venus razor and its so easy to bring with you anywhere you go. Definitely a must for your vacation bag!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this razor! Works like a charm. I have the regular razor from this brand and its definitely my absolute favorite!&lt;br /&gt;I tried many razors in the past and this brand wins it for me.</li>
    <li> I received this razor courtesy of Influenster and I absolutely love love looooovvveee this razor! It effortlessly removes the hair and at the same time gives a very close shave. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and it also keeps my skin feeling soft and moisturized. Definitely a must buy!</li>
    <li> I received my venus snap complimentary from influenster for testing purposes.I really liked the fact it had soap already on it which makes it easy for a quick shave. No shaving cream needed! Also for me its important that a razor doesn&#x27;t cut me, which this one did not. The only thing i wasn&#x27;t a fan of was that my legs burned a little after i used it. But that&#x27;s probably my own fault since i didn&#x27;t apply lotion</li>
    <li> I received this courtesy of Influenster. When I first saw it, I was surprised by how compact and small this razor was. It&#x27;s super sleek, and perfect for traveling- you can just throw it in your bag and takes up minimal space. After using it for the first time, my legs were smooth and hair free! It glides on my legs easily, and is the perfect razor!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor. It is perfect for on the go when you need a razor the most. The case in comes in is awesome too!</li>
    <li> It is a great product. I love having the smaller razor to take with me whenever I go on trips.</li>
    <li> Although I did end up not being a huge fan of the size, this is an incredibly convenient razor for travel, and the size was barely a hassle at all. I&#x27;ve never used a razor with more than 3 blades, and I didn&#x27;t expect anything to be different or better by having the 5 blades, but I was so wrong. I got the smoothest, closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten. The swivel head is also an incredibly convenient feature for getting harder to reach places like your knees or behind them. I love this razor and I will continue to purchase cartridges for it!</li>
    <li> I received this to try out from Influenster for testing purposes and I loooveee it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little packaging for a powerful razor is just phenomenal. I mean you can&#x27;t beat it. Leave it in the beach bag or your makeup bag and you&#x27;ll ALWAYS have a razor and won&#x27;t have to go out and buy one! I mean don&#x27;t buy it expecting a full out shave from a regular razor but it is good for bikini and pit touchups. You know, places that big razors can&#x27;t quite get to. Overall, this will be my razor in my pocket!</li>
    <li> At first, I was very skeptical about the short handle. I&#x27;ve used a long handled razor my whole life! This tiny razor is so easy to use. I have already been in love with the Embrace shave, but the Venus Snap is incredible as well!</li>
    <li> This razor may be small but it certainly passed my expectations. The case is very sturdy and perfect for traveling. It will easily fit into your purse or makeup bag. Not to mention the handle allows for a more controlled and closer shave. Yes, the price is a little more than I would usually pay for a razor but I have to say this little wonder is Oh So worth it! Well done Gillette Venus!</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with Venus Snap Embrace Razor! It is so convenient for on the go, just throw it in your purse, luggage, etc for those time when on vacation or camping. It&#x27;s easy to use and light weight, it fits anywhere, even your glove box in your car. I was running late one morning going to meet the girls for lunch, I shaved my legs at home got to the restaurant and noticed I missed a spot, I reached inside my purse pulled out my Venus Snap Embrace razor and touched it up! I recommend this to every girl on the go!</li>
    <li> Very good razor! Only problem I saw with it being &amp;#34;on the go&amp;#34; was how slimy my legs felt. So there is more involved then just wetting the razor.</li>
    <li> this product is great for on the go! it is compact and just the right size to keep in a purse or gym bag. last a significant amount of time too! definitely would consider this product if looking for a great travel sized razor, even has its own little storage case.</li>
    <li> I tried this nifty gadget through testing this out on Influenster.com, and I like how you can easily transport this anywhere that you need to shave some sightly stubble. My legs are going to be Amazing for this summer-yeah!!! This is very convenient while on the go, which makes it simple to use anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;I am clapping for this Venus Snap!</li>
    <li> I recently received the Gillette Venus Snap razor from Influenster for testing purposes and I love it! Its super convenient for the beach or pool, perfect for summer time! The case makes it perfect to just throw it in a bag and not have it thrown around and getting dirty from other stuff you might have in your bag. It is the perfect size for any one who might travel a lot! I love it!</li>
    <li> im super obsessed with this razor. not only do i use it on the go but i actually use it in place of my normal razor that has a handle. the grip and small handle are so much easier to use than a razor with a handle!</li>
    <li> I recieved this product complimentary to try at Influenster.com. I have to say it is great. I always shave the night before I wear shorts or a skirt the next day but it never fails that I always,always miss some hair!! With the Venus Snap it is so easy to go back over the missed hair before I walk out the door...or even IN THE CAR!! It is very handy and works amazing.</li>
    <li> I received the Venus Snap for testing purposes complimentary from Influenster. I was not sure what to expect from this product, but the quality actually surprised me. I love the compact size of the handle and found it very easy to use. The case it comes in is nice as well, if you wanted to toss it in a gym or overnight bag. I think this razor would be great for traveling.</li>
    <li> I never would have thought about a travel razor or needing one. A razor seems simple enough to add to your travel bags but having the Venus Snap showed me how much easier it could be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the greatness of Venus in a compact and convenient size with a travel case. It&#x27;s TSA carry on approved!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a Venus user, they give me the smoothest shave without nicks and cuts.  This handy travel razor is perfect for traveling and uses my regular Venus razor cartridges, so it&#x27;s convenient that I don&#x27;t have to buy different blades.</li>
    <li> Venus razors are always one of my go-to products. I like the fact that this razor comes with a case, which makes it an ease to travel with. However, I don&#x27;t think that this razor is space-friendly. The case it comes with is a bit bulky if you&#x27;re trying to travel light.</li>
    <li> Quite liking this little gadget I received from Influenster! It&#x27;s a mini razor from Venus which is marketed toward on-the-go shaving needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually I just make sure to always keep a cheap, disposable razor in my car, but I hate using it because it irritates my skin like crazy. I&#x27;ll be all red and itchy afterwards which is almost worse than just leaving the hair in place and dealing with it. With this razor though there are two lines of moisture (one going all the way around the razor head!) that keep that from happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just wet it a little bit to activate the gel strips, and shave. It glides totally smooth and leaves a perfectly shaved surface behind. It even comes with a cute little handy carry case which (and I love this feature) has little holes in the bottom so the moisture doesn&#x27;t get trapped in the case! They really put a lot of thought into this razor. The handle even has a soft, bendy plastic on it to help with gripping it since the handle is so small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I did receive this item from Influenster so it was free, and I&#x27;ve got to say that now that I&#x27;ve seen the price I might not buy a second (one for my car and one for my purse). Maybe if it was closer to the $5 mark I might consider it. $10 is pretty close to what a regular razor would cost. I also can&#x27;t find the refills anywhere, but this is clearly made to be refilled because the head snaps off.</li>
    <li> This thing is so easy to throw in your purse or your bag when you&#x27;re on the go. Especially if you&#x27;re traveling it goes in your bag and takes up almost no room at all.  You don&#x27;t even have to bring your shaving cream because it makes its own! The cream also leaves your skin feeling smooth for your night on the town. I highly recommend this razor!</li>
    <li> I love this as an on the go razor, but it didn&#x27;t give me as close of a shave as I would have liked. I&#x27;ve gotten closer shaves on my legs from single leg razors. This is very easy to use, though, and very aesthetically pleasing. I easily see why it would appeal to women. It glides well, too, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about knicks or cuts. Overall, this is a great (but slightly bulky because of the case) razor for places like the gym or traveling, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it unless I was in that situation.</li>
    <li> This is a great little gadget. The compact size makes it really nice for traveling (I&#x27;m a big fan of the travel size shampoos and conditioners and all that so naturally I was all over this thing.) The razor works really well too, it seems to have stayed sharp longer than the other drugstore razors that I normally buy. I also like that it comes with it&#x27;s own soap and lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Can&#x27;t say much about the price because I got this one free from influenster.*</li>
    <li> This little razor is awesome on the go! Last week my husband called me and asked if I&#x27;d like to go with him on an impromptu date night. I got off of work super late and had barely anytime to get ready.. and I realized I forgot to shave that morning in the shower. Uh oh..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I remember I had the Venus Snap razor and whipped it out in the bathroom at work. All I needed was a bit of,water and I had a perfect shave with no bumps or razor burn. I slathered on some lotion and I was ready to go! It definitely saved the night. I felt more confident the whole night and my legs felt smooth even the next day! Thanks Influenster. You s saved my night!</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for me! 4 kiddos and a wedding photography I constantly forget to shave! LOVE this thing soooo much!</li>
    <li> This is a high quality, convenient razor perfect for throwing in an overnight or gym bag when your on the go. I love that this razor has all the benefits of a regular Venus razor, yet is compact and easy to carry. It&#x27;s simple to use, leaves you with smooth legs, and is reusable. Can&#x27;t be beat when it comes to razors! Nothing else like it on the market.</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary Venus Snap from Influenster for reviewing purposes. I went camping Memorial Day Weekend and decided it would be the perfect time to give this little cutie a try. It was! Overall, I really like the product.  It&#x27;s small, girly, and comes with a case that makes it convenient for travel. I was able travel ravel so shave quickly with smooth results and WITHOUT the nicks and  razor burn that so often accompanies the use of disposable razors i usually travel with. Overall, I still prefer my longer - handled razor for at home use, but I&#x27;ll certainly be packing this reusable little gal along for my travels.</li>
    <li> [...] &amp;lt;---- My blogpost explaining how I got this razor. I love it. I am a HUGE fan. I brought it to Orlando on a weekend trip and I am bringing it to New Orleans next weekend. It is palm sized and bright colored. The blades are beautifully sharp and the conditioning Embrace is fantastic. My legs felt great after shaving and I always get red bumps, but I still haven&#x27;t and it&#x27;s been 3 days!!! I am SO pleased!</li>
    <li> I was definitely skeptical about the Venus Snap. I didn&#x27;t see myself using a travel razor (I mean really, who shaves in public?) so I didn&#x27;t think this would be useful to me at all. Thankfully, I tossed it in my bag anyways. Today, I missed a spot shaving and noticed at work. I got out the Snap and within 10 seconds, I was good to go! Not an everyday razor, but a definite day-changer when you need it!</li>
    <li> I love this so much! I used it and it was so quick and got all hairs, the handle is really great and loved the pod it goes in. I stopped using shaving cream because the bar on it made me not need to! I will buy refills and I totally reccomend. I revived this from influenster for reviewing purposes.</li>
    <li> I recently got this in my influenster vox box and I have to say I LOVE it! It&#x27;s the perfect size for traveling, can fit in small places, the case is awesome. I like how you can buy new blades for it, most the time when I&#x27;m traveling I just buy disposables when I get to wherever I am going just because I can throw those out but this will now be the the one I carry and Travel with! I don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting all gross or anything! I just absolutely LOVE this little razor!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for travel and provides a great shave! It is easy to store and the little band of lotion doesn&#x27;t wear out to fast.</li>
    <li> I was sent the Gillette Venus snap from influenster to give my honest opinion on. This on the go razor is very convenient for me, I&#x27;m absolutely in love with it. The only problem that you may run across is how sharp the blades are beginning out, I&#x27;m very light handed and I cut myself about 2 times. But at the same time, the sharpness is a good thing because it will take longer for the blade to dull. Which means buying less razors for you! Overall I would give this product an 8 out of 10, just because of my few minor cuts. I would buy this product with my own money when it&#x27;s time for a replacement.</li>
    <li> Definitely thought it looked a little silly when I opened the box.  I got this product from Influenster for free to use for testing purposes.  It packs the same punch as the full size razors but has the added functionality of being super portable.  Easily fits inside your purse, gym bag, or beach bag.  Also great for traveling.  And if you already own sever blade replacements, the venus line will fit on this little handle too!</li>
    <li> I received this Venus Snap Razor complimentary of Influenster. I immediately liked the packaging and thought it was convenient for travel which I believe is even what it is marketed towards . I would definitely use this to bring in my purse if I&#x27;ve been busy and need a little touch up or I see that I forgot a spot (which I sometimes actually do...hate that). I&#x27;ve read on here that the handle seemed strange to some which I can understand why they would think this but it my experience I found it just as comfortable as using a standard size handle. The wider larger part ( where the pink is in this picture) makes it very comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did not like about this product most was the razor. This may be just personal preference but more razor blades are not necessarily better in my opinion. In the past I have found that the more blades there are the harder it is to clean which is true of this product (they have five blades). Even though it did have as many blades as it did for the price I would have expected a closer shave than I received, although my sensitive skin sure was happy in the end. This just costs more than I&#x27;m comfortable spending on a razor. As a college student I&#x27;m on a strict budget and this doesn&#x27;t fit mine.</li>
    <li> Stragglers be gone! I got this from influenster and I am so glad I did! It is so easy to hide away in my purse and take with me for my everyday needs. If I ever have a misplaced hair I am easily able to shave it off while on the go!</li>
    <li> I received my product courtesy of Influenster. This product is great for on the go.  It comes in a great carry case so I don&#x27;t have to worry about a loose razor and is compact so it does not take much room.  Only issue I have is it isn&#x27;t able to reach some hard to maneuver areas.  A solid four stars :)</li>
    <li> I received this razor for testing purposes from Influenster.  I really like Venus Razors, so I was very excited to get to try this razor.  I wasn&#x27;t dissapointed.  It performs just as nicely as a normal sized Venus Razor, but it is nice and small.  I love being able to toss it in my purse, and have it on me for quick touchups.  It comes with a nice case to keep it in and I would recommend it for those of us who don&#x27;t like to be unprepared for those inevitably missed hairs when we go out!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor! You get such a clean, close shave with it! I used this razor everywhere and was happy to say that I had no razor burn afterward, even when I had to use it with water only during a photo shoot! I would highly recommend this razor to travelers as it is compact and can easily fir in your purse or suitcase.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product. Very easy to use and so convenient. Even though it is tiny, it still works great like a normal razor. Definitely recommend this product. Takes up hardly any room and is great for on the go! Buy one and you&#x27;ll see!</li>
    <li> Its cute and easy to handle. Not for a full in shave, but works great for in the go! Very handy and portable</li>
    <li> So i got this razor from influenster and it is honestly one of the best things i&#x27;ve recieved out of a voxbox. I usually just use disposable razors and they always give me razor rash, but this razor gives me a really clean shave and makes my skin super soft! I brought it to Tennessee with me recently and the little carrying case it comes in is so convenient because you dont have to worry about your razor getting dirty or cutting things and it has little holes to drain the water and its also great for hotel/condo/cabin showers! I&#x27;ve always hated showering in hotels or cabins because I feel like theyre dirty, so I enjoyed having something to sit my razor in while i wasnt using it instead of leaving it on the ledge of the dirty shower or something. I also really like the squishy handle because its fun to touch and its comfortable for my hand while I&#x27;m trying to shave. The only problem is that the refill blades are like $25 and I dont have the money for that right now, maybe I can afford it when I become a millionaire.</li>
    <li> I really love the concept of this product! The fact that I can take it with me on the go is great. I stay at my friends house on the weekend and it&#x27;s nice to not have to take my regular razors with me, instead I could take this one since it&#x27;s small and compact!&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin very smooth and I&#x27;ve noticed that the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back as fast. No irritation or razor bumps like with my other razors. I will definitely be buying more refills for this great item!</li>
    <li> I love this! I got it complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and it was GREAT! So compact and easy to use. I can use it when I miss a spot! lol Its in my purse right now! ;)</li>
    <li> I received this complimentary for review purposes from Influenster and I&#x27;m glad that I did. I wouldn&#x27;t use this as my daily razor, but I love it for travel. It&#x27;s small so it fits anywhere and the case is super handy to make sure it stays clean and doesn&#x27;t snag on anything else you may be carrying. Honestly this is so convenient that you could pop it in your purse and touch up in the bathroom of wherever you are if you happen to find a patch that you missed. Even better still there are small holes in the case so your razor doesn&#x27;t get moldy. Great design.</li>
    <li> Love the usability and small design of the Snap. It&#x27;s perfect size to fit in any bag and to always have on hand.</li>
    <li> So pleased!&lt;br /&gt;My needs were for something compact, reliable and sensitive on my skin. All things came in this small package. I was exited to pack it in my &amp;#34;hospital bag&amp;#34; when I recently had my baby. It actually got used and I was happy I included it in my few things to bring.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved the close shave I got with this razor, I&#x27;ve never had a razor that allowed me to go more than a day without shaving and this one does. I think the refill cartridges are pricey but I will probably be looking for coupons on these refill to counter that.</li>
    <li> I got this this Gittelle Venus snap thru influenster, got the chance to try it out, let me tell u is a mazzballs  is easy to use leaves ur skiing smooth is easy to carry in ur purse or make up bag  because is small n it has it travel case. Best part is that u don&#x27;t have to throw it away like  u can replace the carthdrige.</li>
    <li> this razor is small but yet a hairy girls best friend i get a smooth close shave everytime the razor head dosent jam with hair an easily rinse out with warm water also come with a compact for discreet n sanitize storage</li>
    <li> The Venus Snap is amazing. When I first received the product I was a little worried about how the razor will perform because of how tiny it was. I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would do as well as regular sized razors but I was so wrong. Even though it&#x27;s pretty tiny it fits great in your hand and very very easy to shave with. It actually was very easy to shave with and it got rid of all hair with one shave. I didn&#x27;t have to keep going back over places like I had to do with other razors. It also made my skin very smooth. It honestly does just as much if not more then a regular size razor with the benefit of being able to take it anywhere and everywhere with you!! Trust me when I say you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This is a great product to chuck in your overnight bag or gym bag. It&#x27;s very compact and the case is very handy. It is perfect to touch up or get that spot you missed on your knee. I tried shaving my whole leg with it as I had run out of regular razors, and the small size did feel awkward for this task. I do like the 5 blade cartridge. Great for sensitive skin and gives a super close shave. I got zero irritation from the 5 blades. If for some reason you don&#x27;t like this razor cartridge, it is interchangeable with any Venus blade, so you can customize this travel razor to your needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get this free to test from Influenster.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of having a quick and easy solution for accidentally missing a spot. I love that it isn&#x27;t a janky razor head either. It&#x27;s small and discrete enough to carry with the compact is lovely so the waiter will drain and won&#x27;t ruin the moisture strip. Love this. I was sent this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, and this is my honest and genuine opinion of this product.</li>
    <li> This thing is great to keep in your purse. It&#x27;s so tiny it fits in the palm of your hand and can easily be used anywhere on the go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. However, all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I RECEIVED THIS RAZOR COMPLIMENTARY FROM INFLUENSTER FOR TESTING PURPOSES. I LOVE THIS ON THE GO RAZOR. VERY EASY TO USE (JUST ADD WATER) AND LOVE THE RESULTS. ON NEGATIVE IS THE HANDLE IS A LITTLE ON THE SMALL SIZE OTHERWISE GREAT!</li>
    <li> I received a Gillette Venus Snap from influenster to try. It is a really unique razor that would be great for on the go, or trips. The handle on it makes it a little difficult to control the angle when shaving because the  blade flops around a little bit, I actually cut my leg below my knee which is something I never do. I think because of the case and the size it would be good to pick up when I go on a vacation or throw in my purse for a quick shave when won&#x27;t be home, but not something I will use regularly.</li>
    <li> Perfect to toss in my gym bag. No shave gel needed (since it&#x27;s Embrace), and the cute &amp; clever &amp;#34;compact&amp;#34; keeps it in place. Love!</li>
    <li> The idea of having a razor in a snap is perfect! I travel a lot and used to just throw a disposable razor in my bag which I hated doing after I used it, but the case this razor came in was everything! My only issue is that it&#x27;s really small and the pink grip on it was a little slippery to handle. Overall it gets the job done and I can throw it in my overnight bag</li>
    <li> I really like the size of the razor, it&#x27;s excellent for traveling and the case is a nice a feature.</li>
    <li> I really like this product! I can&#x27;t believe it wasn&#x27;t thought of sooner. Perfect for those Opps i forgot emergency shaves!!The packaging is great and convienent for on the GO! And not to mention it still does the same great job as its big sister! I will be purchasing a few more of these just to make sure i have one in my gym bag and one in my makeup case!</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin super soft. I liked the fact that it was small and in its case so I could take it anywhere.especially since I&#x27;m always on the go!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Venus Snap with Embrace Razor free from Influenster and am in love with it. I travel a lot and find myself always forgetting a spot on my leg. I don&#x27;t like just using a dry razor so this is perfect for my sensitive skin. The handle is easy to hold and even though the razor is tiny I can get a good grip while shaving. There is a band that lets out some magical stuff that makes shaving on the go easy and hurt-free. I would buy this razor even if I hadn&#x27;t gotten it for testing purposes and will be purchasing more blades to go with it!</li>
    <li> I have never been able to shave on the go before without major razor burn. I got this item a week ago and have used it everyday. Works great!</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this razor. Not only is it small and portable but it ACTUALLY works and keeps my legs smooth. Great to throw in your purse or luggage. I love this razor,</li>
    <li> This razor is awesome for on the go! It fits perfectly in your purse with its own little carrying case.Gets a nice clean shave and I absolutley love it!!!!</li>
    <li> This is so perfect for anyone that is always on the go! I can easily fit this in my purse for going to the beach, out with friends, or even just to work. I received this complimentary from influenster for testing purposes and I absolutely love it. It keeps my legs smooth anytime any place!</li>
    <li> So ok, I&#x27;m notorious for cutting myself when I shave my legs... but guess what? Not this time! The razor glides over your legs leaving them silky smooth. No blood, no stubble. Perfection!</li>
    <li> The shorter handle gives me better control! And i love the small size because it is great for travel! I got mine for free from influenster but would gladly pay money for this! I will be buying refills for this razor as soon as they&#x27;re needed! Good job Venus!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best razor to travel with. I was a bit skeptical about it because I didn&#x27;t think it would fit in my hand, but I was wrong. That fact that I got really close shave made my day. My legs were so smooth that I could not keep my hands off of them. In the future I will defiantly buy this razor again and I got this one just in time for my vacation.</li>
    <li> I received this razor via Influenster in my Venus Snap Voxbox and I am actually quite impressed.I really like the easy open package! I didn&#x27;t have any problem trying to pry open the plastic or having to get scissors just to get to the razor. I like having a easy open package because on the go its definitely a plus. The small case it comes in is definitely handy for traveling. Its a nice blue color, and the case easily fits in your purse or make-up case without having to worry about the razor breaking or slicing through anything.I like that there are holes on the case for the water to seep through (so the razor doesn&#x27;t become moldy). The only problem about the case is if you leave the razor wet in the case, the blades may get rusty faster than without the case.&lt;br /&gt;Since the razor and case  are so small, it&#x27;s nice for packing. When I first used it, it took me a while to get used to the grip on it, it was weird to figure out how to hold it, and it slipped a few times. I like that the head glides and moves to fit the form of your leg. The shave wasn&#x27;t too spectacular, the blades didn&#x27;t get a real close shave, but it got the job done. It was not a smooth shave and I have a lot of irritation after I use it on my legs. I would repurchase this product, say, for a quick pick up, but it&#x27;s not something I will continually buy. I would not recommend this product to people who enjoy a nice clean smooth shave but for a quick on the product its a perfect tool. I do have to say though its a five blade razor and should have a great smooth affect. So, why spend $10.00 on a razor that may be nice on the go when you can spend $6-8 on a normal Soleil Bella and get a great smooth shave. While its cute, I wouldn&#x27;t say that its for daily use but more of an emergency type of razor. *The blades on the razor could be due to the Embrace Venus blade so if you like another Venus blade head better you can switch it out (which is pretty cool)*</li>
    <li> I received this razor complimentary from Influenster, and while it&#x27;s super cute and tiny, the case it comes with is probably my favorite part. There are holes in the bottom for easy draining so it doesn&#x27;t stay wet while you&#x27;re traveling. The small handle is a little difficult to maneuver, and the blade should not be used without water or gel/cream/whatever. There is not a lotion strip, so dry shaving will not be a pleasant experience. Additionally, I have a metal allergy, so while my legs are usually fine with regular razors, the blade quality is really tested on my underarms. Probably a little TMI, but my skin reacted horribly! I immediately broke out into a red, itchy, painful rash on my armpits. I was aware that it would probably break out, but this was the worst of all the razors I&#x27;ve tried. Just something to keep in mind if you have even a slight metal/nickel allergy...you will more than likely have a reaction as well. Overall, it&#x27;s a good concept...travel size products are always popular, but for the money spent, it&#x27;s not that special.</li>
    <li> This little razor right here is awesome! Perfect for travel. Ideal for a gym bag or to save room in your vacation bag. I love it!</li>
    <li> Love how smooth it feels and the easy on the go capability! Definitely a must buy for traveling and on the go showering.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from influenster for testing purposes. I feel like I am always on the run. This razor allows me to still feel soft and smooth even on the go. I just toss it in my purse and go.</li>
    <li> I received this razor in the mail from Influenster for testing purposes. While the razor is cute and convenient, I felt as though I had no control the first time I used it. As I&#x27;ve used it more, it no longer feels that way. This razor does take some time getting adjusted to because of the small handle. Although I received this for free I would like to point out that for $9.99 you only get this tiny razor and a case. There are no extra cartridges. You can use any Venus cartridge on this razor (like all other venus razors), but each box still costs in the mid teens for a box of 4 cartridges; with most other reusable Venus razor you get at least one extra head for the razor. This razor is a great idea, I&#x27;m just not sure that I love it</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Influenster. It is a wonderful little travel razor, complete with its own convenient case and no need for a shave gel or cream. A few days after I got it, I needed to run some errands and was in a hurry. I shaved my underarms in just a couple of minutes and got a good close shave with no shave gel and without even removing my tank top. On the flip side, not as great for shaving your legs. Tried it in the shower on my legs, and felt like the gel on the razor itself was not holding up very well, and my legs felt a bit irritated. However, for a quick touch up or for underarms, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This razor was pretty easy to use. It comes with 5 blades and it has this rubber mini handle which is in my own words &amp;#34;a gripper&amp;#34;. It even comes in a convenient little blue case that has holes in it which allows it to air dry... or at least I think that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s for. Overall, I liked it. It gave me a decent enough shave on my legs while I was out and about. I think that it is perfect for taking with you practically anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars was because I had to go over the hair on my legs about 2 times before it was entirely gone and my hair is a bit thicker. I would still recommend this razor though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for free compliments of Influenster.</li>
    <li> I knew I wanted this when I saw it on Target shelves.  I got mine compliments of Influenster and immediately knew I needed to get another for my gym bag and use the one I have for traveling.  This is such a well-designed, lightweight, easy to hold razor.  It&#x27;s five blades and I can use one swipe and get smooth legs - that is saying a lot because I have coarse, thick dark leg hair.  I love that it comes with its own carrying case, because I can travel with it without worrying about having to get messy or caught in my makeup bag.  I love that it&#x27;s small, compact and so lightweight, compared to other razors which are bulky and heavy.  The case comes with breathable holes on the bottom so i don&#x27;t have to worry about it being packed away wet.  I have never been so excited over something so practical as a razor, but it&#x27;s something we use everyday and something this simply and well-designed is like a revelation.  Well done Gillette, you have a devoted buyer from me.</li>
    <li> I got this item complementary through Influenster. I was pretty pleased with how well this Razor handled considering how small it really is. I love the portability of it, and it can easily be thrown in a beach bag or purse since it has a handy carrying case. The only thing that was kind of a problem was how to grip it, and that wasn&#x27;t even that big of a deal.</li>
    <li> Admittedly, I was skeptical about the necessity of this razor at first. I mean, what&#x27;s the point? Well, now that I have had it for a couple of weeks, I am loving it. It is absolutely perfect for my gym bag or to take with me if I have a busy day ahead. I wake up to go to the gym for a 5:15am class and don&#x27;t have time to shave before that so this little razor has been absolutely perfect. It comes in a great little travel container and fits beautifully inside my small toiletry kit for the gym!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the shorter, more compact version of this razor for my bikini area but it makes shaving your legs harder. As a woman, it can be difficult sometimes to shave the pubis, around the labia, and the thighs etc. and all the other sensitive areas of the bikini zone. The smaller handle this razor features allows me to be able to move better around each part and piece and it has prevented nicks and cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor has five blades that provide a very close shave and the moisture stip is nice for keeping the skin supple and moist so that razor burn is minimal. Another feature is the case that this travel system features. The case has ventilation in it so that your razor gets dry. The vents keep the  blade from rusting and the moisture strip from being dissolved too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of warning, because of the intense moisture strips around this razor, be sure to dry the razor thoroughly before storing it because the blades will get covered in the moisture strip residue if it gets too wet. The box does allow it to air out, but if you put it up in a damp environment, it doesn&#x27;t help as much. The best way to protect this razor is by proper storage and use.</li>
    <li> I was given this nifty little razor as part of a Voxbox on Influenster.  And luckily for me, it came right when I was going on a trip across country, so I could use it as it was meant - a travel razor!  I threw it in my baggage, flew across country and the next day, it was time to wear a cute little dress and - you guessed it, shave my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I broke out the cute little carrying case from my bag and noticed instantly that the blade is the exact same as my Venus Embrace full size razor.  That&#x27;s a feature I love.  I have extremely sensitive skin and the standard disposable razors always irritate my legs when I used them. Knowing how my skin reacts to the Embrace blade, I knew immediately I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about lots of skin irritation over the weekend when I would be wearing dresses non-stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only part that I wasn&#x27;t the keenest on was the handle was a little difficult to get used to.  True, the shorter handle is what makes it so portable, but it just seemed a little hard to get some of the right angles I needed to get the closest shave possible.  I dropped it a few times and was scrambling to pick up my tiny little travel razor.  Still, if that&#x27;s the only downfall, that&#x27;s really pretty awesome still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to top it all off, the nice little case that held everything tightly in place.  Ventilation holes allowed for the razor to dry and any excess water to get out, and by the time it was time for me to repack my suitcase, I was able to just chuck it in with the rest of my things without worry that the blades would slice and dice my favorite pair of jeans.  All in all, I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and I&#x27;ll definitely keep using it for my future travels.  The razor I know combined with the convenience of the easy carry case make it a no brainer.</li>
    <li> I received this razor complimentary from influenster for testing purposes and I love how compact it is. It is a good razor definitely the best one I have tried! I like that it is small enough to take everywhere!</li>
    <li> I love the idea of this product. I can take it anywhere, and I travel a lot. But I was worried about the case..it seems like it is too flimsy. The actual product is adorable but the strips were not my favorite. They got the job done, but squeaked on my legs the whole time! Quality blades though. B+</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS. everyone should get this particular razer.  it does the job and leaves your legs smooth. i highly recommend it for anyone who needs to shave their legs.</li>
    <li> I love this small travel razor. I travel a lot and I like that it has a case because sometimes I take out a shower before I check out hotel. The case keeps my other stuff in my bag from getting wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only will like a department to keep my extra razors</li>
    <li> I received this complimentary of influenster. I was not compensated all opinions are my own. Firstly this little razor packs a punch!!! It&#x27;s small, portable, and great to take on the go. As with all Venus Gillette razors, the razor head can be changed intermittently with other Venus Gillette razor heads which is perfect, as you can buy which ever razor head you prefer. The razor came in a snazzy solid blue Cointainer which  makes it so much easier to carry it your purse,in your car or luggage. What&#x27;s also great is the handle is easy to hold and provides a nice close clean shave whenever you need it. This razor isn&#x27;t just for your bathroom use anymore! I take this razor everywhere, along with a travel sized shave cream. No more worrying about that stubble or hairy legs anymore! Great razor,highly recommended. A must have for the girl on the go.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this razor for my work travel. It comes with a handy carrying case, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about my razor bumping up against my other toiletries or worse finding a case to put it in. I highly recommend this for ANYONE who travels or shares a bathroom...think college dorm.</li>
    <li> A little Razor that packs a HUGE punch! I love that it fits in my purse perfectly! Must have for Vacation</li>
    <li> I really love this razor!  Brought it with me when we were on the go, and the shave was great!  Much better than the typical disposables I bring with me.  Would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> The Gillette Venus Snap razor is awesome! It is compact and easy to pack in a bag, but still has full size power of a normal razor. My only complaint is that the handle is too small, but thats the point, isn&#x27;t it?</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Fits in hand nicely&lt;br /&gt;Blade is just like all other Gillette Venus blades, which is terrific.&lt;br /&gt;Portable container included&lt;br /&gt;Useful on the go or just whenever you shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
    <li> I love it, it&#x27;s really easy to use, super cute to! I would love this product even more if the refills weren&#x27;t so expensive, if money allows I will most likely stick to this razor! It also comes with a pretty nifty case with little drain holes to make sure the water drains out before you travel again!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the size and the portability Its great for travel and the 5 blades gives you a really close shave! Overall great product!</li>
    <li> I bought this in a local store the other day for an upcoming vacation.  My daughter loved it so much she wanted one of her own.  I saw it for a good price on Amazon and I ordered another.  It comes in a sturdy snap-case and it will protect you from unexpected cuts when reaching into your bag.  It is very easy to hold, not slippery like some razors with longer handles.  My only complaint is the refills are a bit expensive, so I will have to watch for sales.  The product itself will not disappoint!</li>
    <li> Love the short, wide handle. Made for a close shave in a hurry! Didn&#x27;t even get razor burn---left me with smooth legs and pits!</li>
    <li> I loved how easy and convenient this was!  I would definitely recommend it for travel.  It leaves a smooth and good feeling finish.</li>
    <li> I enjoy a good razor, but I feel like this is almost like every other razor. The Gillete Venus Snap razor is definitely small which makes it great to carry around, but I also can carry around pretty much any other razor too. It comes in a little compact case, which I felt like was a little bulky, but it definitely keeps your hands safe if you keep it in your purse. I like that it already has lotion on it so that you can just get a good clean shave.</li>
    <li> I find this little razor PERFECT for traveling. For one you don&#x27;t need to use any shaving cream, just get it wet and it is ready to go. But even if you still choose to use shaving cream it is convenient because of the size. Really easy to pack in a toiletries or make up bag. I will absolutely be taking this on my upcoming vacation. It also takes any Gillette Venus blade refill and comes in a little case with a few holes on the back to air out the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find myself reaching for it on a day to day basis, but it is always in my makeup bag. Perfect for when I miss a few hairs and don&#x27;t notice until I am out of the house!</li>
    <li> i got this razor for review purposes from influenster, i really enjoyed this. it was one of the closest shaves i had gotten in a very long time. it made my legs smooth and soft. at first i didn&#x27;t think i would like how short the handle was but it actually really helped me control it more, i have most defiantly purchesed the refills and will use this for a very long time</li>
    <li> If you are on the go a lot, this product is great for you. I keep this small compact razor in my purse or gym bag. I love knowing that I have the razor available to me at anytime when I realize that I missed a spot or was even in a hurry in the morning. Gillette&#x27;s razor leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft and does not irritate it at all.</li>
    <li> This little razor is the perfect little tool to carry with you on hot days where you are wearing shorts and don&#x27;t realize you missed some hairs! It&#x27;s so compact it fits almost anywhere. It&#x27;s also great as a travel razor when you ae vacationing, fits right in a toiletry bag.</li>
    <li> I received this item free from Influenster to test out in exchange for my honest review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little hesitant about this razor at first for 2 reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1. The handle seemed clunky, and small for my hands.&lt;br /&gt;2. This blade is just a traditional Venus Embrace cartridge, nothing new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my initial impressions weren&#x27;t so good, I still wanted to try the product, and I wanted to try the product the way they claim we could, just water, no shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were headed to the pool and I needed a quick touch up shave, I figured it was a great time to give it a try. The handle, while it takes some getting used to, wasn&#x27;t as concerning as I initially expected. The pink part of the handle is about the size of a quarter, hence my concern. But, even with my giant, graceful hands, it was easy enough to get used to and maneuver over my skin. I was left with no nicks. As I mentioned, I did use the razor with only water as they claim we can do. It worked, but I can only imagine that the moisture strip won&#x27;t last very long using it this way. For that, I&#x27;m undecided, I think the handle and small case is perfect for travel, but the claims from the razor itself would be claiming you can get whiter teeth with this travel toothbrush, it all depends on the toothpaste you use! I think if I buy a refill for this razor, and I probably will for the purpose of travel, I&#x27;ll buy one of the refills that advertise shaving cream in the cartridge, making it truly portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is great, it protects the razor but still allows it to dry out, you won&#x27;t have to worry about your razor getting all funky if you don&#x27;t have time to let it fully dry. Most full size razors, even if you can fit them in your travel bag or purse, don&#x27;t come with a travel case, but rather a shower mount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t know how to feel about this razor. I like it, but I don&#x27;t know if what I like is the cartridge, which isn&#x27;t anything new, or the handle and case. I think I like it as a package deal, but like I said, I&#x27;m more likely to give an olay shaving cream refill a try next time!</li>
    <li> *** I received the mini razor from Influenster complimentary for testing purposes*** I absolutely loved this product. It has taken me on a mini vacation, to days at events, and everything in between. Even though it&#x27;s small...that&#x27;s what makes it so unique. I can easily slip in in a purse, suitcase, or bag and it&#x27;s always with me. It does everything a regular sized razor can without taking up too much space. Thank you for the chance to try it out:) ‪#‎InASnap‬</li>
    <li> This razor is convenient and small enough to just through in your purse or bag.  While I don&#x27;t think it gives the smoothest shave, it definitely can come in handy in emergencies.  It works good enough that if you are out and about and notice you missed a spot, you can take care of it pretty quickly.  Also, it fits any Gillette Venus cartridge which is handy.  I am one of those females that loves to use a &amp;#34;man&#x27;s&amp;#34; razor and I guess I have gotten spoiled by the smoothness those provide.  So, I probably won&#x27;t be buying any refills for this razor once I use up the one I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Was sent this by Influenster &amp; Gillette Venus to test and review*</li>
    <li> Work travel is SO much easier with the #Venus In a snap razor! I&#x27;m usually worried about my razor being damaged inside my luggage, but the protective case and convenient size kept the razor intact throughout the course of my cross country flight.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised on the great shave.</li>
    <li> The moment I opened the box, I quickly dropped the compact in my purse. Good thing I did because I noticed I forgot to shave before leave the house and I was wearing a tank top! It was Venus Snap to the rescue! This this is so cool. I also bought the Sensitive with Aloe refills for my skin. So far no sign of irritation!</li>
    <li> I got this razor from Influenster in my Venus Snap VoxBox. I normally dont like girl type razors, but this one is good. It&#x27;s a cute little razor and it&#x27;s great just to toss in your purse or diaper bag. I like that they have it in a little case as well so you don&#x27;t get cut if you reach into your bag. *I got this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I really like this razor because you can store it in your purse for emergencies without worrying about cutting yourself. It is small so it doesn&#x27;t take up space but the razor head is full size. The grip on the handle is nice and makes it safer to shave with. The moisturizing barrier activates with water so you can shave discretely too. All in all, it&#x27;s a good razor to have on the go for those days you realize you forgot to shave.</li>
    <li> I received this little razor from influenster a few days ago and, WOW. I have never owned a razor that made my legs so soft! And it&#x27;s portable! Comes in a super adorable little case and is actually very easy to use. I will definitely keep using this.</li>
    <li> This little razor is perfect! I received it for testing purposes from Influenster and I am so happy I got too! It is perfect for those situations where you may be rushed and you forget to shave somewhere, as a mom this happens more often than not to me! I love how compact it is so you can throw it in your purse or travel bag and still have room for other stuff! I would definitely recommend this to everyone! The little compact carrying case also has holes in it so that your razor can dry and not sit in water and get rusty! It is ingenious!</li>
    <li> I received the Venus snap complimentary from influenster.com and I love it for on the go and its so small it doesnt take up much room&lt;br /&gt;@GillettVenus&lt;br /&gt;#InASnap</li>
    <li> I am the worlds worst at missing a spot while shaving in the morning and then not noticing until I get to work or school! The little beauty saves me everyday now that it fits conveniently in my purse or makeup bag. I love the case design and the refills are easy to use. I do have to say it is not made for those hard to reach areas ladies (cough cough) but it is great for its purpose as an on the go razor! Great buy and very handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please Note: I received a Gillette Venus Snap from Influenster to try.</li>
    <li> I received my Venus Snap from Influenster for review purposes, and so far, I really love it! I normally purchase disposable razors because I feel they last longer and give an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; shave for the price. I have tried a Venus razor once in the past and, although it was a fantastic product, I didn&#x27;t think it was worth the price so I stuck with my disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying out the Venus Snap, I am so impressed that I&#x27;m finally changing my mind and purchasing refills! It&#x27;s amazing! I had the smoothest, closest shave of my life, hands down. It glided so effortlessly that, for a second, I thought it was working. But it works great and didn&#x27;t miss a single spot. It doesn&#x27;t pull or tug and makes skin feels soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s also a lot of reviewers complaining about the size of the handle and how hard it is to hold it, but since I have small hands, I&#x27;m able to use the smaller handle without any problems and actually, prefer it. The Venus Snap is small enough to fit anywhere so it&#x27;s great for someone who lives with 3+ roommates and share the same bathroom - like me. So, it&#x27;s compact enough to store anywhere without taking up a lot of space but large enough to hold all the great features of a full-sized razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I did not purchase this item, I can&#x27;t give a proper review on the price, but for $9, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it. Now that I have a handle and ( a super cute ) small case, it feels worth it to buy refills. But I don&#x27;t think the Venus Snap is worth almost $10 unless you&#x27;re looking for something more compact and travel-friendly.</li>
    <li> The razor blade is amazing. It&#x27;s really nice that it is portable with it&#x27;s own traveling case. This razor gets hard to hold once shaving cream covers it, and I keep accidentally removing the blade because of where the button is.</li>
    <li> I was a little bit skeptical at first because the Venus Snap is such a weird shape.  It&#x27;s pretty easy to use, and the weird shape doesn&#x27;t affect the shaving ability at all.  I loved how smooth my legs were when I finished, and the carrying case is great!  This razor is definitely going to be my new go-to for travel.  I got this razor complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I can remember so many times in high school when we made an impromptu trip to swim in the river, and I had forgotten to shave.  I shouldn&#x27;t get caught in that situation anymore, because this nifty razor has found a home in my bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few things that I really like about this razor:&lt;br /&gt;√ It&#x27;s by Venus and can use any Venus razor head.  Venus is a brand that I&#x27;ve come to trust.  I&#x27;ve been let down one too many times by slightly less expensive razors.&lt;br /&gt;√ The handle is wide and rubberized.  The idea of this razor is that it can be stowed in your bag for somewhat unplanned uses.  I was worried that the handle wouldn&#x27;t give me the sort of control that I would want when shaving in strange situations, and I think Venus thought about that too.  The handle is wide and has grips on both sides, which allows me to keep a good grasp on it.&lt;br /&gt;√ It only needs water to get a good shave.  What good is a convenient, mini razor if you need shaving cream?  Luckily, you don&#x27;t need any extra shaving products with the Venus.  I would apply lotion after use, but I always have lotion in my bag anyways.&lt;br /&gt;√ The added compact is sturdy and nicely sized.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve stuck my hand in a bag just to get cut by a rogue razor.  I don&#x27;t have to worry with the Venus Snap and I appreciate that.  The compact also has vent holes which will keep the razor head from staying damp and soggy once you toss it back into your bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product by Influenster and Venus to review, but that doesn&#x27;t change my opinions on this product in anyway.</li>
    <li> I love this razor for on the go when I&#x27;m traveling or just going To the gym! The size of this product is perfect to throw in my purse before I leave the house. When the razor gets dull all you have to do is replace the head! That&#x27;s what makes this product even better, you don&#x27;t have to throw the whole hing away and buy another one, all you have to do is buy the replacement and your good to go!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for on the go! It&#x27;s small size allows it to fit in any of your bags, but it does not hurt your hand while using it. Also, you don&#x27;t even need soap. You just need to run it under some water to use it. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a quick shave. I received this complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster. I&#x27;ve seen the price of it, and I believe it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this from influenster! I took this with me on a camping trip this past weekend. It was so easy to put in my bag and take along with me. I didn&#x27;t have to worry about sticking my hand down in my bad and accidentally getting my finger on the razor head. It is also small and compact so it fits well in small travel bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one down side to it being small was that it took me a few uses to get used to the smaller handle. But once I got used to not having the normal handle to grip it was perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it gave me a great shave which left my legs smooth and feeling very silky! I would definitely recommend it to anybody!</li>
    <li> I love this razor! It&#x27;s perfect for traveling or anytime when you miss a spot or two and need to fix on the go. I used mine when going to an unexpected night out with the girls. I was early and was able to do this in the bathroom! Perfect!</li>
    <li> The idea of shaving on the go is very impractical, first off. I find this product hard to use while it does offer a nice close shave the shape is awkward to hold. When I travel I would rather just grab a disposable razor not this. I think five blades are over doing it. Three are just fine.</li>
    <li> There is so better than just being able to drop my razor in my pure and go and then of course the smoothness that you get while shaving with it!!</li>
    <li> What I like most about this razor is that you only have to shave one time in one place. I&#x27;m not sure what it is, but there is also a lot less irritation after shaving. I also love the compact size and the case it comes in.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Its small enough to fit in my purse which is great because I usually always find a spot I missed on my legs as soon as I walk out the door.  This product is small and leaves my sin feeling moisturized after I use it, not dry.  I was nervous that I would get razor burn after using this, but I didn&#x27;t! Great product, wold definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This is definitely meant for someone on the go. It doesn&#x27;t replace the regular handle Gillette Venus in the shower. But this is perfect for a touch up when you aren&#x27;t at home and are in a hurry. It is compact and comes in a little case so you can easily keep it in your purse, backpack or car. It works great for me when I am on the go and I still get a great shave!</li>
    <li> I love this small razor it&#x27;s so easy to use it leaves my legs feeling smooth and it&#x27;s convenient. It comes in a small case so you can take it with you anywhere. Can&#x27;t wait to take it with me on vacation!</li>
    <li> This convenient little razor is great for on the go! I received this free through #influenster for the #inasnap opportunity to test the product. My experience is that it is efficient for travel and easy to grip. I enjoy that I am able to just through into my bag and go with the convenient carrying case ensures that the razor cartridge is not consistently falling off and getting lost in the limbo of my purse.</li>
    <li> Not only is this razor convenient for travel but I genuinely had the smoothest legs I have had in a long time form using it! So easy to pop in and out of a travel bag and leaves your legs feeling moisturized and smoother than any disposable razor you&#x27;ll take on vacation!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and super super convenient!  Very easy to throw in any handbag or gym bag!  Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I got to try the Gillette Venus with Embrace on-the-go razor thanks to Influenster and their VoxBox program free of charge and I have to say that I love it! It’s mini, it’s discreet, easy to use (wet and shave) and I can bring it anywhere. It was perfect for an impromptu date with the bae or just missing a tiny spot on my legs. I would definitely recommend this product for girls on the go! The only negative is an obvious one - don’t try to shave a whole month’s worth of hair - this is not for that, haha.</li>
    <li> At first I thought that the tiny handle would be awkward; so I was very apprehensive about using this product.  To my surprise the little handle gives you excellent control as well as helps you apply even pressure, so you don&#x27;t get razor burn or cut yourself. It applies a nice even smooth shave and has a cute tiny compact that fits in your purse, gym bag or in your travel case. The compact gives it a nice storage space so you don&#x27;t have to worry about putting a wet razor back into your suitcase, purse or gym bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very portable, affordable and comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> I love this razor! I received it free to try from Influenster. I love how small and compact it is, so easy to just toss in a tote or purse. I really like the little holes in the case to allow the razor to dry fully. I used the razor after forgetting to shave my underarms. Oops! The razor is so small, discreet and works extremely well just like a full size razor!</li>
    <li> This razor is great. The blades are good and create a nice, clean shave. Don&#x27;t be afraid of the handle, it is super easy to use!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor! It&#x27;s easy to use on the go and fits anywhere in my purse travel bag or gym bag!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice product. I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought it or looked at it if it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that I received it free. Being someone who forgets to shave their legs, it&#x27;s a great product to bring on the go if I feel like I need to rid my self of excessive leg hair.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the razor! The size makes it perfect and convenient for travel, of which I do a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I actually really like the small handle - I have small fingers and hands so I don&#x27;t find it hard to use.&lt;br /&gt;The razor is of great quality, and I am excited to take this with me on my first cruise :)</li>
    <li> I love my Venus snap! It&#x27;s compact, easy to use and leaves my legs smooth. It&#x27;s a great idea for those on the move. I will definitely be buying a new one to keep in my purse and one for traveling! I received my Venus snap from influenster for free to try! Thanks Venus and influenster I really enjoyed this simple to use product it will be great to have in my purse for those missed spots while I&#x27;m out and about.</li>
    <li> I am a mother of two getting time to shave is sometimes non-exsisitant. when we went to the beach last week i realized i forgot to shave my armpits! AHH but then i remembere influenster sent me a snap venus razor pull it out and within seconds i was good to go! Id buy it a million times!</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone looking for a nice razor to take on vacation, but do not want to pack their larger razor set.  I love the compact case that conceals the blade when you toss this razor in a suitcase or toiletry bag,  I also love that you do not have to compromise on a great, smooth shave while traveling!</li>
    <li> I loovee it!!  A must have for all girls! easy to carry and assemble  It did a great job of lubricating my legs as I was shaving left no stubble or razor burn&#x3D; one Happy Girl!!</li>
    <li> I received this razor free to try from Influenster. I&#x27;m really glad they sent it because this razor is great for summer travels and my gym bag. It gets a really close shave, like all Venus razors but comes in a great portable case. I also like how small it is, and that grip is nice.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this razor to anyone.  I love how small the razor is. It makes it very simple to pack. It&#x27;s great for travel or everyday use. The handle fits perfectly in my hand. The carrying case is perfect for storing your razor. I always worry about sticking  my hand into my travel bag because I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m going to get cut. With the carrying case, I worry less!</li>
    <li> I recieved this product complimentary from influenster. I actually really like this product. It is very convenient for travel and shaves nicely. I don&#x27;t get razor burn and it gives a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I received the Venus Snap for free in an Influenster VoxBox and of course had to try it out. I really really like it! It&#x27;s not an &amp;#34;OMG I HAVE TO HAVE THAT&amp;#34; type of razor, but it is really nice to have around. I keep mine in my downstairs bathroom for those times that I&#x27;m running out of the house and realize I forgot to shave my underarms or to touch up my legs, haha. Running around with a baby makes me forget to do these things sometimes!</li>
    <li> Received this gem from Influencer in my #InASnap vox box. Must say that I love the razor and the smooth shave I get.  My only complaint is the size of the handle. ..either needs to be a little longer or a little more narrow.  Definitely nice for travel!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! So easy to use in a convenient size. Now that I&#x27;ve started to use this, I have no idea what I did without it. Would recommend this to ANYONE. It will seriously change your daily routine and is an essential when traveling!</li>
    <li> I received this as a free sample from Influencer. It was amazing. Very compact and I love the carrying case.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I was extremely excited when I was chosen to receive it and try it out!! I have used it a number of times since I received it about 2-3 weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I thought the handle was going to make it extremely hard to use, but to my surprise it was actually no problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I carry it in my bag everyday. To work, when I go out, or to the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely has my vote and I would recommend it to everyone. It is also extremely useful for people that travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I received the awesome little Venus snap free from Influenster and it was the greatest little gift! I keep it in my purse and it has saved me from many situations such as noticing I need a last minute shave at the gym! I can&#x27;t decided my favorite part about it. It has a great little lightweight case to protect it, complete with air holes so it can dry safely on the go. The changeable/disposable razor piece has the embrace style gel that allows me to shave with just water. It makes my legs so incredibly smooth! It also has a nifty little squishy grip on the handle making the small design easy to grip. It is seriously the BEST travel razor on the planet!</li>
    <li> OK, so I got this from Influenster for reviewing purposes and I was excited to try it out!  I absolutely love how small it is! This Razor fits perfectly in my bag and is perfect for a quick shave before a date, and absolutely perfect for traveling. I loved the First shave it was the best shave I ever had, but after trying it out a few more times i realized the razor didn&#x27;t last as long as others. All in all I would say this is amazing for travel and I would say not so much for everyday shaving, because they are on the pricey side and don&#x27;t last as long!</li>
    <li> The first time I used it it was perfect, my legs were amazingly smooth, However the second time it seemed to not be as close of a shave as the first. I would recommend this for travel, but I&#x27;ll stick to my normal razor for daily use</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Venus Snap from Influenster to review. I love how compact it is, I can just throw the little case in my gym or beach bag and go. It says you don&#x27;t need any shave gel, which is great, but I use some type of shaving lotion because I feel like without it I get razor burn. Other than that I love it! The blades are really high quality and it&#x27;s easy to pack and use.</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary Snap from Influenster and I could not be happier! It is super convenient to have a portable razor (and not have to tote around a razor in a Ziploc bag, amiright?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed some people on here saying they have a hard time holding onto the handle because of its shape, but I feel just the opposite. I really like the flat handle because it prevents me from accidentally slipping the handle between my fingers and the thing turning sideways and  cutting a giant gash in my leg, which definitely was an issue for me with regular razor handles. I think it is super easy to hold, you just have to find the most comfortable way for you to hold it. It&#x27;s flat, so you obviously can&#x27;t hold it like other razors, but that doesn&#x27;t make it bad or hard to use. It&#x27;s definitely worth the price. I love this little thing and would recommend it 100x over.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;ve marketed a razor for &amp;#34;in a snap&amp;#34; use, for the go-go-go ladies [...and men? Any men out there?] and have cleverly called it &amp;#34;The Venus Snap&amp;#34; [Ha.. haha... see what they did there? Venus SNAP? As in the venus fly trap that snaps shut? .... Don&#x27;t judge. Those buggers are adorable.] First, the packaging has the razor inside a hard blue plastic clamshell. The razor itself is securely snapped into position, and there are holes in the bottom for water and air to pass in/out of. It&#x27;s compact, and quite discreet should you not want anyone to know your secret to stubble-banishment. Second, the razor itself is small, fitting within the palm of your hand, though uses a standard-sized blade head. These specifically came with Venus Embrace attached. The handle is circular, with a soft and flexible rubber pad in the center to stabilize. It was this circular shape that I found was most impressive! I didn&#x27;t anticipate how much this would make shaving with either hand, and in harder to reach areas, EASIER! Truly, genuinely, it did though! It bent over the curve of my knee, and behind, and around ankles [not to mention the underarms! DREAM-like!!] like a figure skater in the olympics. It was AWESOME. Thirdly, the choice in blade head was perfect. So smooth, it really doesn&#x27;t need anything more than a little wetting to work [Just like its advertised!]. There was a coupon for some more of these heads and you can bet I will be using it!</li>
    <li> I really like this razor! Its the smallest I have ever used but I love the compact it comes with to store. I love that I can put the razor in there and it just drains all of the water out!! Definitely worth the buy</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the size of this razor fool you it works just as good if not better as some other full-sized razors. I myself was truly skeptical about how this razor would work, but now it has become a new addition in my go everywhere bag! I received my razor from Influenster free of charge for testing purpoeses, and I have every intention of buying blades and continuing to use this razor!</li>
    <li> I got this razor free from Influenster. I took it on my honeymoon packed in my small bag. It traveled really well and provided a super smooth shave. I love the travel container.</li>
    <li> I received my Gillette Venus Snap from Influenster to review, before they sent it to me I had never seen it in stores and I  hadn&#x27;t seen any ads or reviews. After using the Venus Snap I can definitely say that I love it, and I can see myself using it for years to come.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I think that the small size actually makes shaving more efficient. I get no razor burn or cuts or dry skin from using this. Personally I think all the Venus razors are overpriced but I think this one is actually worth the money. It comes with the cute blue carrying case that makes traveling on the go so much easier. I know I am one of those people who constantly miss spots when shaving so this little razor is a godsend.</li>
    <li> I received the Venus Snap with Embrace via Influenster and it&#x27;s perfect for women on the go. So many times I get to the gym before work and find that ummm my under arms or legs aren&#x27;t shaved. It comes in a tiny little package and fits right into my bag.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this razor! It works just like to suppose to. It was better than I expected. It convenient, portable, and easy to use and I don&#x27;t have to fuss with shaving cream! All I have to do is wet shave and go! I have the regular razor from another brand and this is my favorite razor. I tried plenty of razors in before, but Venus is for better for me. The razor is AWESOME, It great for carrying around in your purse. It is small, compact and does the job lovely! I&#x27;m glad I was able to review this product completely free from influenster and gillette venus!</li>
    <li> Litterally one of thee greatest products. Out there great for on the when you see you missed a sopt jb shaving or when traveling over seas barely takes up space.</li>
    <li> This little razor is the perfect thing to throw in your purse for a night out or a trip to the beach. It works great, leaves you smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave any bumps. I definitely would recommend this razor for any of my friends and family!!</li>
    <li> I always used a regular razor to shave my legs just because I though they all did the job. But after receiving this razor from Influenster for complimentary testing purposes. I&#x27;m in LOVE! Seriously, is small compact and I can take it anywhere. In about two weeks I&#x27;m going to be traveling so this razor is coming with me. I like that it has 5 blases, and gives me a smooth shave. Also, the compact has small holes on the back to where the water can come out of once I&#x27;m done using it. So is very sanitary &amp; it won&#x27;t build up any residue. I have already told my friends about this &amp; they have purchased it. Overall, it was a genius idea from the size, the compact, travel friendly, &amp; smooth shave.</li>
    <li> This little razor is the best travel companion!  It fits with the rest of the Venus products and can easily be switched out. Definitely buying this product again :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that the individual packages are still rather pricey....</li>
    <li> I really like the shave of the Gillette Venus razors but I find them hard to hold on to in the shower.  So when I saw this razor with a short handle, I immediately put it in my Amazon cart.  It arrived and I actually looked forward to shaving my legs, which is normally just a necessary nuisance. :)  I am very pleased with the razor and have already added a second one to my cart to put in travel bag.  The storage case is an added bonus.</li>
    <li> I loved this razor for the moment I saw it. I enjoy it&#x27;s compact size it fits right into my medium sized purse also fits in diaper bag. I use this razor for on the go but I have also used it At home and it gives great results! All you need is a little water on the razor and your legs and you are good to go to use. It leaves my skin smooth and silky. This has made my random beach and pool visits awesome I always tend to miss to a spot. This gets in all he areas.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for my travel and gym needs. I really like the size of the razor and that the blade size isn&#x27;t compromised.</li>
    <li> gillette venus razors in my opinion hands down one of the best razors a girl can buy. they have a all different types to suit any girls need. The newest product is the gillette venus snap. mine came complimentary thanks to influenster. The razor head that came on it was a venus embrace. I actually usually buy those when buying new razor heads. They come with 5 blades that give you a close shave and are sensitive to my skin. the handle on the venus snap is tiny but fits perfectly in you hand to give you a shave you need. like all the other venus razors it has an easy release. the razor fits snuggly in its case. the case has holes in it so any water can leak out and not ruin the razor head. like the name says the case snaps shut providing a perfect way for your razor to travel.</li>
    <li> I think that its a good product overall, its small and easy to use but that&#x27;s where the pros end. When I left the razor in my purse, it got hot in my car and the moisturizing part of the razor melted and got all over the container that it came with. I don&#x27;t know if I would pay $10 for this product. I received it complimentary from Influenster in a VenusVoxBox.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillete Venus Snap with Embrace Women&#x27;s Razor free from Influenster to try and review. When I first saw this razor I was really afraid I was not going to like it as it has next to know handle but was pleasantly surprised when using it. It could very easily be the most handle-able razor I&#x27;ve ever used and did an amazing job around my ankles and knees without cutting me. I also had a bachlorfette party and wedding to attend in the couple weeks following me receiving this razor so I put it inside it&#x27;s small blue case and put it in my purse. I was very grateful I had packed it when I arrived to the bachlorette party as it was revealed we were all wearing tank tops out that night. I love that this razor fits easily in my purse at all times and I do not have to worry about it cutting me or getting hair from other things I&#x27;ve packed caught in it. I am also able to put it directly back in its case after use without waiting for it to dry out as the case is vented and it can just dry inside.  I&#x27;ve also used this razor both with shaving cream and on dry legs and it works amazingly either way without cutting me or irritating my skin. I would highly recommend this razor to any woman who spends a lot of time away from home.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I does the job.Basically this product works. It&#x27;s useful because it&#x27;s compact. Since it is compact you can take it everywhere with you. I know this because I have a small purse unlike my sister&#x27;s which have these huge designer bags. I personally don&#x27;t like to take everything with me like my sisters do. I only put important things in my purse such as this small portable razor. I basically need this now. Especially when I&#x27;m invited to special events. This product is like a life saver. Like literally if you miss a hair you can just reach in your purse and pull out your razor and shave but you need to add water though. Since you need water I now also carry a small miniature water bottle with me too. Wow, I guess that when you are in need of in an emergency you will also have to carry other stuff to go along with it. Either way I think think if this product never came out I would of kept my beach towel on.</li>
    <li> The Venus Snap razor is a great traveling razor! The case was great to have.  It didn&#x27;t take up a lot of space in my suitcase.  It was easy to use and got the job done! I would recommend this razor!</li>
    <li> I love this for large places such as your legs, armpits, bikini area. I would not suggest this for smaller, finer areas such as facial hair. The reason why I say this because if you observe the shape of it and the placement of the razor, it is not near any edges. So if you wanted to get all of the hair, you would need to swap above the area about an inch. Unless you want to shave your nose off or ear off (side burns) do not get this for finer area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this for larger areas. It&#x27;s a close shave. I&#x27;ve had a razor that shaved closer but this comes close. I highly suggest this for those who are interested. And hey, if you are looking at this review when I am posting it, take advantage of the coupon! Almost 75% off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was sent this to review for free from Influenster. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I hate leaving razors out in the open and the long handle was always a bit of a hassle for me. This razor solved all my problems and is just perfect. I got a couple for traveling and at home. However, I can see how some people who are not flexible or have tiny showers would find this razor hard to use.</li>
    <li> Hard to work with. Not for underarm or bikini area shaving</li>
    <li> works great. Fits well in travel bag</li>
    <li> I use the full/regular size Venus razor at home, but wanted something smaller for travel. This one is perfect, since it&#x27;s compact, and comes with it&#x27;s own case.  It also uses the same refill blades as the full size razor.</li>
    <li> The greatest accessory to have in your bag!!!! So easy to you use! Leaves your skin absolutely smoother than a baby&#x27;s bottom! I have used other brand name razors but none of them leave my skin as nice as the Venus Snap🙌🙌! Greatest razor by far ! A +++</li>
    <li> This deserves 5 stars across the board. It&#x27;s unique, small, and even comes with its own little carrying case. The size is a little awkward at first, but you get use to it. I recommend it to anyone out there who needs or wants a traveling razor.</li>
    <li> This has to be the greatest thing next to sliced bread. It&#x27;s great for a person on the go, and I would recommend this to anyone that is always on the to and may not have to shave,</li>
    <li> I recieved this razor complimentary of Influenster. I really love this razor because of the ease of use and its compact size. I would recommend this razor to anyone for a vacation or just regular at home use. I gave it 5 stars cause it is that good.</li>
    <li> ILOVE IT ! wants smooth legs this is the best racer eveeeer. i love it because its small and you can take it anywhere ! it easy to fit it in your purse.</li>
    <li> Loving this new Venue razor.  It is small enough to fit in my makeup bag and the carrying case insures it doesn&#x27;t ruin anything in the case.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I recieved this product for free to try thanks to influencer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it! It&#x27;s so easy to use and works better than any other brand of travel razor I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I usually don&#x27;t like to buy disposables but I&#x27;m going to start purchase the Venus brand.&lt;br /&gt;They give such a smooth shave and NO RAZOR BURN!  And I&#x27;m very sensitive and I had no reaction.</li>
    <li> Small &amp; portable, has it&#x27;s own case. Perfect to throw in luggage or in your purse for a trip! It was sturdy - I accidentally dropped it in the shower and it didn&#x27;t break apart like some razors I&#x27;ve had before. Also, very smooth shave and if you miss a spot, easy to pull out of your purse and touch up without the need for water. I give this an A+! It&#x27;s also cute because it&#x27;s mini.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> Very nice razor handy to go in the beach bag or purse. No more embarrassing moments where u missed a spot shaving.</li>
    <li> Love this new razor! The small size and carrying case make it the perfect travel razor. I just switched from the Schick Quattro to this and am very happy with it. The only thing I would change is the price. Including a 2nd blade would make me very likely to purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Perfect for taking a razor on the go while traveling. It even comes with a little plastic pouch, that makes sure you wont forget it at your hotel room! LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
    <li> I received this from the Influenster program to test out. I honestly love this! It&#x27;s small enough to fit in your purse or gym bag. I like how it has Embrace, so you only need water and you&#x27;re ready to go. Great for last minute touch ups! I would highly recommend this product. I know people are complaining about the price, but razors go on sale at drug stores all the time. There are usually coupons to stack with the sale, so you can usually get a good price. Just stock up when they&#x27;re on sale!</li>
    <li> I got this from Influenster. This works well on my legs, leaving them smooth without irritating my extremely sensitive skin. Also, the carrying case and size of the razor is convenient for travelling and bringing places when I am on the run but still need smooth legs. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I like how it is compact and easy to store in your purse when on the go. It&#x27;s actually sort of cute. Venus always has great razors so it&#x27;s just as good as any of their other products.</li>
    <li> I really like this mini Venus razor- super convenient for my gym bag, overnight bag or purse.  Wish it would work in a carry on at the airport but I digress...  The case is perfect to keep the razor protected and the 5 blades ensure a close shave.  Love that you can use regular venus razor heads as replacements.  My only complaint is that the handle is so short that my fingers pushes on the razor head release button from time to time.  Otherwise, great stuff!</li>
    <li> I love the Gillette Venus Snap with Embrace Razor! It&#x27;s small and super cute. Plus, it comes with a carrying case! Despite it&#x27;s small stature, the handle is really easy to grip. You&#x27;ll get a smooth shave, every time. Perfect for traveling. I simply put it in my purse, just incase! :)Thanks again Influenster.com for the free VoxBox and coupon for blade refills! You guys rock!</li>
    <li> I recently received this travel razor from Influenster.com for testing and I love how compact and convenient it is. All you have to do is wet the blades and shave. I had to repeat the process a few times but I&#x27;m overall happy with the outcome. My skin is somewhat sensitive, but I didn&#x27;t have any razor burn without using shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 5 stars because that&#x27;s exactly what it deserves. My legs felt smooth and amazing. I didn&#x27;t miss a bunch of spots on my knees/ankles. And, to top it off, I didn&#x27;t have razor burn after. I highly recommend this product. Thanks to Influenster for allowing me to test this product complimentary.</li>
    <li> Perfect when you are on the go, especially when you take showers at the gym or you are going on a weekend getaway! Same good quality as a regular Venus size razor but super convenient with the small compact case!</li>
    <li> The Venus Snap with Embrace is PERFECT for my honeymoon. I got this from Influenster. I have used the Venus in the past, but this is an on-the-go version. It even comes with a carrying case with ventilation so that you can throw it in your bag without it snagging your clothes.</li>
    <li> The fact that I can slip this into my overnight bag and not worry about it breaking as I travel is wonderful!!! I also like the fact that the head moves.  That makes it easier to get the behind the knee area without cutting myself like usual.  The five blades help out a lot as well.</li>
    <li> Before receiving my complimentary Venus Snap from Influenster for testing purposes, I was skeptical it could get the job done in such a small package. Boy was I wrong! It&#x27;s comfy handle was easy to grip and the razor held it&#x27;s own, making my skin super smooth with ease. Love the baby case it comes in so I can toss it in my gym bag in a snap! Totally worth the $</li>
    <li> I really love this razor. It is small and can really fit in your purse.  I actually had to use it the other day we were on a car ride and I noticed hair on my knees so I grabbed a baby wipe because I don&#x27;t like shaving dry skin and grabbed my razor and got the hair I missed in the shower thank goodness I had this with me!</li>
    <li> This razor is a must have. Camping this weekend and it was so easy to shave and it&#x27;s compact enought to fit in my pocket and take it on the go. Way better than the schick intuition.</li>
    <li> I received this courtesy of Influenster and I must say I liked it better than I thought I would. The case is handy for keeping your razor safe and separate from your other toiletries or items in your bag. There are vents on the case for any leftover water to escape but personally I&#x27;d wipe down the razor dry after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, you can place any Venus cartridge of your choice on the razor handle so it&#x27;s customizable to your preference. The handle feels better in my hand than I thought. It looked like it&#x27;d be too flimsy and hard to maneuver but that was not the case at all.&lt;br /&gt;Size is excellent if you don&#x27;t use the case, the handle + cartridge is about the same size as a ketchup packet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for anyone&#x27;s travel bag.</li>
    <li> This razor is so incredible! I love how it&#x27;s compact and comes with it&#x27;s own case which has little air holes so you don&#x27;t see any of that nasty humidity. It works so well too! Gets the job done quickly as well as leaving your legs hydrated. I am going to be using this one for a while.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the Gillette Venus Snap Razor.  It&#x27;s great for traveling &amp; quick on the go.  The 5 blade razor works wonders, and the grip on the handle is great!  Definitely a space saver when it comes to traveling!</li>
    <li> This thing does the same job as the regular size razors do. Theyre super convenient if you&#x27;re on the go at the beach or pool and realize you forgot to shave or missed spot. They fit nicely into your purse, clutch, or diaper bag and theyre very inconspicuous!</li>
    <li> I got this item from influenster so I can&#x27;t say much for price, but I do love how compact it is. It fits into my purse for on the go and is small enough to keep at the highest point in my shower to keep it away from the kiddo. I&#x27;m personally a fan of all Venus products, just not their prices.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Influenster and I am impressed!&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t leave razor bumps or anything like I expected.&lt;br /&gt;It is activated by running it under water and then shave like normal without gel!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for on the go!&lt;br /&gt;and comes with a cute case to stick right down in your purse!&lt;br /&gt;Totally Recommend</li>
    <li> When I had received this small razor I had just seen one youtuber talk about it, so I was excited to try it for myself. It is small, comes with it&#x27;s own case and the razor heads are sharp to get you those beautiful smooth legs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size is great to throw in your suit case or gym bag and you don&#x27;t have to worry that the blades will dull or you&#x27;ll get cut because of the protective case!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this product (and I&#x27;m one that usually only gets disposable cheap 2 blade razors), but from now on, I&#x27;ll be buying the replacement heads and keep using this! Consider me converted!</li>
    <li> Love love love the product . I was running around like a chicken with my head cut off when I received it in the mail and I just threw it in my purse so I could try it out later. I was in a wedding the day I got it and coincidentally I forgot to shave and had it with me so I pulled it out and tightened up. It was so smooth and didn&#x27;t leave my under arms feeling irritated and dry. Its also very convenient , I love the compact size and that it comes in it own little carrying case. I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product to those who travel or are always on the go. It leaves your skin feeling silky and so smooth. It is small so its easy to stick in your bag without a problem. I love it.</li>
    <li> I recently received this from Influester.  The case the razor comes in is adorable and wonderful for traveling but the razor leaves a lot to be desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor seems very cheaply made.  I was also expecting a razor that didn&#x27;t require using shaving cream. Since this razor is made for travel it seems silly that they didn&#x27;t bulk it up a little.  If I were to take this razor on a trip I would also need to bring shaving cream, which even in the travel size bottle takes up valuable space.  Overall, not worth it.</li>
    <li> I really like the fact that this razor is small and compact enough to throw into my makeup bag. I love venus razors and I am really excited to take this on an actual trip and not just using it at my house. I wish it was more water friendly. I do not use shaving cream on a regular basis so it makes it a little harder for me.</li>
    <li> I love how I can throw this product in my suitcase and have it take up minimal space. The blades are great, and the shave is phenomenal. I definitely will be purchasing again for some of my upcoming trips.</li>
    <li> This little thing is perfect to toss into my purse right before running out of the house to make it in time for a play date or my kids flag football practice!! All my single mommies should understand!! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I received a Venus Snap razor from Influenster.com to review. It&#x27;s a good razor but that&#x27;s just the blade. I usually use another brand&#x27;s disposable and I much prefer the longer handle. It&#x27;s cute and I can throw it in a bag, that&#x27;s great. If I used those blades for my regular razor, it&#x27;d be okay because then I didn&#x27;t have to spend $$ on razors for something I only use occasionally. The case is neat, but I don&#x27;t like that there are holes in it. If I toss a wet razor into my purse, I don&#x27;t want any dampness to leak out. I&#x27;ve had airlines break my disposable razors and just snap the heads off or else they go missing. (Yes, in checked bags). The perk to this razor is that I can take the blade off already but it would be cheaper when I get to my destination to just purchase a single disposable for the duration of the trip than a pack of razors that might go missing in my bag.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Influenster. The weekend I got it I was on my way to Florida to watch my brother get married. This razor fit perfect in my purse and worked out great for missed stubble before the wedding and also worked great when we were out on the beach and my husband told my I missed a spot shaving my arm pits. lol We&#x27;ve all been there and most of the time we just hide the stubble and feel embarrassed but you don&#x27;t have to with this razor. The only downside is that I wish they came up with this when I was a teenager lol. I also really love that these use the same blades as a regular Gillette Venus razor so I don&#x27;t have to buy separate razor blades. Definitely worth it just to have in your purse for those surprise moments.</li>
    <li> I chose to give this a 5 star because of how it surprised me! About a month ago i received the Venus Snap with Embrace through a company called (Influenster) I have loved it every since! This razor is amazing initially when i received it I was expecting for it not to work as well, but this thing packs a powerful punch! I love the fact that it is compact and has a cute carrying case with it, it offers a very close shave and gets in those tiny places that can be frequently missed, good thing is you can always have it with you it&#x27;s tiny  enough to fit in your purse discretely! I recommend this product especially for people who are always on the go perfect for travel!</li>
    <li> At first I thought that this would compromise quality and usability for the handy size when I received it in my Influenster Box but it works better than most of my other razors and it super easy to use!</li>
    <li> I travel very frequently so having a razor that is travel friendly and works with out shaving cream is a must for me. I like the compact size of the razor. It worked as well as other Venus razors. This is a product I would recommend buying if you are on the go frequently!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Venus Snap complimentary for testing purposes from Influnester.  I have always loved how smooth Gillette razors leave me feeling.  Now it&#x27;s even better because when I&#x27;m out and about on the town and notice a missed patch I&#x27;ve got my handy dandy Snap with me!  It&#x27;s the great quality of Gillette in a travel size!  I love my Snap and wouldn&#x27;t trade it for the world!</li>
    <li> The size and convenience if this product is great! I really enjoyed using this product, however, while it has many pros, it also has cons. The replaceable razor is is coated with a moisturizing strip that completely dissolves and sort of congeals is left in the shower (like I accidentally did). Overall, it&#x27;s a great product to throw in your overnight back.</li>
    <li> Will absolutely recommend Venus snap. Leaves you clean with no much effect and it is so much better that you can easily carry it with you so even in the brightest light, you are confident that you can fix any thing you had missed in the lower light of your home. love the case.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this razor! It is the perfect size to keep in your bag when youre on the go, great for the beach! Im always in a rush shaving in the shower, so this little guy helps me out if i&#x27;m out and about and notice i&#x27;ve missed a spot!&lt;br /&gt;Also saved me when I had an unexpected trip to the beach and i wasnt &#x27; ready &#x27; to be in a bikini!! lol</li>
    <li> I got this received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I absolutely love this product!! This is by far my favorite razor. And I got a coupon with it so I do plan on buying another!! Thanks Influenster!!</li>
    <li> I really liked this razor. It was easy to use even though it was smaller. It was great for around the knees and for behind them. It gave a really close smooth shave as well. I liked the traveling case as well.</li>
    <li> I hate having to shave, but this razor was really nice. I was very surprised that you could just add water and use it. I have problems with razor burn, but this razor did not give me any problems. I was able to keep it in my purse and use it whenever I needed! I would recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
    <li> -RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FREE TO TRY FROM INFLUENSTER-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this product. At first I was like, okay, it&#x27;s a razor. But man! It&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s small and easy to carry with you for those times when you might need a quick shave. For example, I go to a lot of doctors appointments right now for my pregnancy and sometimes, I forget to shave in the shower. So, with this, I just shave and go! No lotions or soaps needed-just the razor and water!&lt;br /&gt;It gives a nice, close shave and leaves your skin feeling super smooth!!!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the go a lot like me, give this a try!</li>
    <li> This product works so well! I love it! I bring it with me EVERYWHERE! I recommend this for traveling anywhere!</li>
    <li> I Absolutely love this product. What makes it awesome is that its small enough to take anywhere and everywhere also you can use pretty much any where it goes smooth on my legs and leaves them amazing I would recommend it to anybody. I thank @influenster for introducing me this amazing product. its quick and easy for people that like simple things&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated it this highly because its that good of a product in my opinion</li>
    <li> I love the razor. It is small and convenient. It fits in any small bag or purse, and is perfect for trips or unexpected outings! It takes normal blades so you can transfer them from your big razor to your to go razor if you need to. It is small enough for travel, but still gives you the close irritation free shave you expect!</li>
    <li> I was given a Venus Snap razor to try by Influenster. I am so grateful for it! I absolutely adore this little guy. I had no trouble using the smaller handle. If anything, it actually helped me! Sometimes I feel awkward when it comes to long handles and I had no trouble gripping this thing perfectly for the best shave. It glides over my skin wonderfully and doesn&#x27;t leave behind an itchy rash or irritation. I have really sensitive skin and have tried more razors than I can count. Finally I found a razor that didn&#x27;t give me any sort of reaction like I normally have! It&#x27;s so tiny and easy to store, too, which I love. It tucks away perfectly in a travel bag or in the shower. I also love that with just a bit of water, you can do a quick touch up in no time at all. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about my legs being super gross when I go out in shorts. With just a few short minutes and a bit of water on the razor, I can go out clean shaven without worry. I will definitely be using this razor for a long time!!</li>
    <li> ok well first off i recieved this product from influenster for free to try out. i was so excited to give this a try. when i received it in the mail i immediately opened it quite small. but it did come in a cute small compact container with the razor inside. i also received a coupon for a refill so i was glad. now i&#x27;ve used this for a couple of weeks, and well i got to say its great for travel and it does work but does not fully shave your legs, well atleast for me it didn&#x27;t i had to go over them about twice to fully shaved. the razor head is alittle big and the grip it had for u to grasp and weird and awkward at times to hold. but it does make a close and clean shave. but not meant for big areas. so i guess depending on what u feel, i would say i would give this product an overall 7 out 10. also my sister thought it was a neat little razor and a good new idea for the size, concept, look the packaging, she said shes willing to give this a try also. im soo not handing mine over though.</li>
    <li> Got this through Influenster, and it is the perfect travel razor if you&#x27;re trying to fit into a small makeup bag or gym bag. Nothing earth-shattering but it is so compact and easy to bring with you!</li>
    <li> For my first few years of shaving, I would always get such bad razor burn no matter what razor I used or how new it was. Then, about  6 years ago, I discovered venus embrace, and for once I could shave without razor burn. It&#x27;s been the only razor I use ever since. This cute little travel size is the same incredible blade head I know and love, in a compact size. I took it with me on a 7-day cruise, and it made packing and taking it so much easier. Plus, I can stick it in my purse and not worry about the size, or it dripping, or the blade shield falling off. I love this perfect little fella!</li>
    <li> Simple to use. Fits ANYWHERE! Legs stay silky smooth longer which me and the hubby both like. Plan on buying refills soon.</li>
    <li> This little razor is the perfect size for traveling, vacations, and those of you that are just constantly on-the-go and don&#x27;t have time to give your legs a good shave!  I used this razor for the first time on my trip to California, and it was great!  It&#x27;s so easy to use and gives you a nice, close shave, leaving your legs smooth and silky.  I am constantly cutting myself somewhere with razors I have used in the past, but with the Gillette Venus Snap Razor, I have not had a single cut!  I recommend this product to anyone and everyone, and I actually use mine all the time at home even when I&#x27;m not traveling! Enjoy! :)</li>
    <li> This is exactly like the full sized razor with a smaller handle. The handle was a little weird at first, but after using it once, I got used to it. I love the case it came in, and I will definitely recommend this product to friends</li>
    <li> This compact razor is perfect for travel.  It&#x27;s compact and the travel case is so handy.  The five blades make for a very close shave which I adored.  However, the handle is a little hard to maneuver.  It makes shaving a little tricky but if you just plan on using this for traveling, it&#x27;s worth it.  The price is a little steep, in my opinion, but not too expensive for a if you don&#x27;t have to buy it very often.</li>
    <li> this is a little different then I thought it would be. But it has a nice little case for travel.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome, really love it. It&#x27;s really good on the run, specifically if you went out and unexpected plan came up, u can even fit this in your wristlet. NOthing else is needed, just go to ladies room, shave, and look hot in your shorts!!&lt;br /&gt;Many Thanks to Seller for great &amp; fast service!!! Keep up the awesome business ethics!!</li>
    <li> My always go-to razor for on the go! Definently the best razor for travel! Its wayy better than those plastic ones that dont even work. Always recommend gillette venus snap!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful razor! I use it regularly! it is great for traveling and it comes with a nice hard case that is also breeze! I would suggest this product to everyone! so worth the money!</li>
    <li> Good on the go but the wasn&#x27;t quite sharp enough for my taste. Easy to carry around and travel with. Perfect size</li>
    <li> My blades rusted after only using twice (I use it as my travel razor)</li>
    <li> This small travel sized razor is great for this moments when you notice that u missed a spot  this will save you from a embarrassing moments</li>
    <li> Love the portability!</li>
    <li> The rubber on the razor melted like chocolate and became extremely sticky...</li>
    <li> This razor is great for traveling (the small razor/case is super easy to pack)! However, it is super pricy for what is is. In reality, I should&#x27;ve just brought a normal sized razor, this really doesn&#x27;t save THAT much more space in comparison. The good thing is that the Gillette blades are interchangeable, so you don&#x27;t have to get a special sized blade for this particular razor.</li>
    <li> I love venus! End of story :)</li>
    <li> Seemed a little pricey at first, but the size of this razor is perfect for traveling! I also love that it comes with a little, blue case to store it in. Fear no more of cutting your hand on your razor while reaching into your cosmetic bag.</li>
    <li> This is a great travel size. I toughed out using it for 3 trips and left it behind at the last hotel. It is quite difficult to hang onto in a shower.</li>
    <li> This razor is fantastic for travel! It&#x27;s so compact and having the travel container is a plus. I took this to Africa and it took up less room than my normal razor and i could leave it out to dry in the container overnight or put back in my bag in a rush and it would always dry out. My only complaint was the same as other reviews...it&#x27;s very tiny and when you hold it you have to be careful of your fingers slipping up to where the razor head attaches. I never had it happen to me personally (maybe because i had read about it beforehand), but i could see how it would be very easy to hit that button and the razor head would fall right off.</li>
    <li> i had a chance to try this product for free #Influenster #inasnap and i absolutely loved it. The new Venus Snap with Embrace Razor is the first portable razor for smoothness on-the-go – just add water! This is going to come in handy for sure because I won’t have to pack shaving lotions and it’s going to be a serious time saver since I won’t have to worry about lathering up and then cleaning up after. This razor also fits into the palm of my hand and comes in a little case for safe storage. The portable stylish compact features Venus’ best Embrace blades on a mini-handle that conveniently tucks into any bag, for the freedom to be spontaneous with must-have smooth skin anytime, anywhere. Just wet the razor and you are ready to go! I could do this in the airplane bathroom. I wouldn’t, but I could ;)</li>
    <li> I love this mini razor! It so adorable and compact and works like a charm! Perfect for vacations or trips! I received this from Influenster in a Vox Box! *received complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes</li>
    <li> OMG this my first time EVER using Gillette I always use Schick because I work there and get them for free but I love this razor!!!! It will be what I&#x27;ll be buying from now on ! 👍👍👍👍👍👍</li>
    <li> I really like this razor, it is awesome and being small is very convenient for on the road. I will definitely be buying these from now on</li>
    <li> I chose to give this product 5 stars because that is exactly what it is- a 5 star product. It is easy to use, quick and efficient. It leaves my legs feeling smooth and my skin feeling moisturized. I have yet to experience any kind of razor burn or negative side effects. A pro is that this product is small, and comes in a convenient case. I can take it anywhere; it discretely hides in my purse! Another pro is that this product doesn&#x27;t require shaving cream- just use water and go! The snap is amazing, especially if you forgot to shave before a date or a party. You can sneak away and shave in a bathroom. I would recommend this product to everyone- but especially college aged people like me, who have very busy schedules and not a lot of time in the day. I feel pretty scatterbrained, and this product makes shaving one less thing for me to worry about- smooth legs... in a snap!</li>
    <li> I received this razor complimentary of Influenster. I travel a lot so its difficult to carry around a normal size razor. With this I can put the nifty little case right into my bag and not have to worry about the blades catching on anything. The head can bend a 90 degree angle, which is really helpful for some hard to reach spots. I really like this razor!</li>
    <li> Love my in a snap razor that I received complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster. It is so convenient to carry around in my purse for those times that I miss a spot and need to touch up. Definitely recommend buying one!</li>
    <li> I received my Venus Snap as part of an Influenster VoxBox. I absolutely love it! It&#x27;s perfect for when you&#x27;re caught out and you forgot to shave. It&#x27;s cute and compact so it&#x27;ll fit inside your make-up bag, just take it out and shave your legs real quick. You&#x27;ll never have to worry about not being prepared for that skirt, swimsuit, or shorts. It&#x27;s not as easy to manage and maneuver as your regular razor but it works just the same!</li>
    <li> Trying wthis out on Influenster.com, and I like how you can easily transport this anywhere that you need to shave some sightly stubble.</li>
    <li> This razor is perfect for traveling, it comes with a compact case for storing after use. It also does an incredible job and leaves you with a close shave and smooth skin!</li>
    <li> i love this razor its super easy to use! i got this razor as a complimentary gift from influenster! its super small but the razor is the same size as a regular razor! i will be purchasing more razors for this product :) i am so obsessed lol</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of an Influenster Vox Box and i really do like it. The razor gives you a really close shave so your legs feel nice and smooth when you&#x27;re done. Plus, the small size is really great. It&#x27;s easy to hold and will certainly be a great travel companion. I also really like that it comes in a little case, making it even easier to travel with. Plus, the case has little holes on the bottom, so even if you put the razor back wet, that water can escape and not get trapped in the case. And, since it uses the Venus Embrace razor heads, it can definitely save you some money if that&#x27;s already the type of razor you use. You can use the same heads for your razor at home and your razor for on the road.</li>
    <li> This is perfectly compare for fitting into my purse. I love having this because I always miss a spot or two and don&#x27;t notice until I get out in town. I like how all I have to do is wet the blades and voila! This little razor is going to come very much in handy!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never really been particular on what razors I use. As long as it would get rid of the crazy mess on my legs, it was okay with me. I am always on the go and I usually just buy a pack of disposable razors and toss them when I am done. When I received this razor, I was a little skeptical wondering if it would be great enough to impress me. So I opened it up and popped it out. I loved the size and the case. It is perfect for my travel bag and I know it won&#x27;t get rusty because of the holes in the case that allow water to fall out. Then came the shave. My legs felt perfect. I wore a short dress and even had my co-workers feeling my incredibly smooth legs. They were amazing. Over-all, I love this product. I will probably never purchase a disposable pack ever again. Great job, Gillette.</li>
    <li> This product is super convenient. The snap razor fits in almost any bag and is great for on the go! It has a good close shave that last and couldn&#x27;t be any better. I&#x27;m truly amazed</li>
    <li> Really love this razor. The head that it comes with has a thick moisturizing type pad that makes it easy to use without shaving gel. It&#x27;s super compact and even come with a little carrying case with vents at the bottom so the razor can air out and prevent mold or mildew. Was pleasantly surprised with this product</li>
    <li> the small size makes it easy to keep in my gym bag for on the go! great smooth shave love it!</li>
    <li> Gillette Venus has a new razor, and it is just adorable! A miniature razor with a fully functioning, full-sized head, packed smartly in a travel case, that has holes in it so you can put it away wet or dry. At home or on the go, this is a genius product that you can use where ever you are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a little bigger than the palm of my hands this razor can go with me wherever I travel this summer.&lt;br /&gt;I have never tried a Venus razor at all before, and it was amazing how much the moisture strips and hinged head with five razors made a difference, leaving no unwanted hairs behind. All I used was the razor and some water, and I got great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I think this is a product that I would use anytime, not just on the go but also at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a handy product that I would definitely recommend to those on the go, or traveling this summer, or even for at home use, because who doesn&#x27;t need a smart practical way to store their razor?  Overall, just a great product.

    <li> So I love this little razor. Got it for free from Influenster in the Venus Snap Vox Box. It is great! I don&#x27;t use it for on the go like they say exactly but it will be great for travel and when using it at home, I feel like the little tiny handle provides you with more control over your shave. Plus I like that it takes the same refills I already use (it can use ANY Venus refill though). Go buy it! It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I received this razor as part of a VoxBox from Influenster and I&#x27;ve been using it for the past week. I love how convenient it is and easy to use. I also really like the travel case with the holes that allow it to breathe! I&#x27;m not the type who carries a razor in my purse for touchups so I can&#x27;t speak about that, but I&#x27;m excited to take this with me to the beach this weekend! It&#x27;s the perfect size for travel and the case will help prevent it from getting my other products messy.</li>
    <li> I got this item in the mail from Influenster just in time to go to my in-laws. I liked how compact it was and the case to keep it in came in handy as well.. Gave me a nice close shave and did not take up any room in my bag!</li>
    <li> The only thing different about this product is the handle- it&#x27;s still the same Gillette Venus razor that I have always used (and love). For that reason, I like it and give it 4 stars. However, i&#x27;m not sold on the little handle. I don&#x27;t see what makes it more special than a traditional razor handle, and I actually dropped it a couple of times when in the shower. The little plastic case is nice, because it keeps the razor off of my shower ledge- for me the moisturizing strips on the razor blade get goopy after a while in the shower and leave marks on my shower ledge.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of easy easy easy!!! This did it for me I could touch up at the last minute and still have time to do everything I need to do. I fell in love its a all around great product and very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I got the Gillette Venus Snap razor compliments of Influenster and it&#x27;s the most efficient travel razor option I&#x27;ve had to date. The compact size and carrying case make it easy to take anywhere but you don&#x27;t lose effectiveness because the blade is full size as on any razor. Plus it is refillable with the Embrace heads from the full size razors.</li>
    <li> This little convenient razor is perfect for me, I&#x27;m always on the go so it fits perfect in my hand bag, whether I&#x27;m at the gym, or just outta town. I can always count on having my legs feeling smooth and soft!</li>
    <li> LOVE the new Gillette Venus Snap razor. I am on the go, so the travel case was a great accessory with the razor. Easy to store and fits right on my top shelf in the shower. The 5 blade razor gets a close, smooth cut and I love the colors. :) I was able to test this product compliments of Influenster.</li>
    <li> This razor is perfect for on the go, perfect size that can fit in any bag, its cute and works really well if you forgot to shave or just missed a few hairs...i definatly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It so easy to just pop into a suitcase or overnight bag. Carry around a bulky razor has to be one of the most irritating things on planet earth and when i received this as a sample through Influenster I fell in love. I will def purchase when this has run its course. It perfect for people who are always on the go. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> So Influenster sent me the Venus Snap VoxBox. Inside I found the new Venus Snap with Embrace razor and a coupon for a future purchase on Venus Razors. Sweet!!&lt;br /&gt;So far I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use the Snap, but I know it&#x27;s time will come. Especially since outside temps are improving! I can tell you that this is one amazing little razor. Everything about it is designed with convenience in mind. However, you won&#x27;t be sacrificing a close, comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size and shape of the handle makes it super easy to hold on to. I love that it takes the Venus Embrace cartridges for two reasons... one being that it can be replaced when needed, but more importantly, you don&#x27;t need shave gel. Just wet it and it&#x27;s ready for use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have I mentioned that it had 5 blades? Yes, five! Just because you&#x27;re on the go doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t still get an amazingly close shave, woohoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t wait until it&#x27;s too late and you&#x27;re stuck in a hairy situation with no way to break free, get this razor NOW!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. The compact size is excellent for your purse,suit case, or even your make up bag. The travel case protects the razor from damage and the five blades offer a remarkably close shave. The small holes in the bottom of the case allows your razor to dry and not rust. There is absolutely no need for shaving cream. I recommend this to anyone. Defiantly worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved my Venus snap for free with compliments of influenster and Gillette Venus for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with the Venus Snap! It is perfect for someone on the go all the time, like me! It is like it was made for me! LOVEEEE it!</li>
    <li> i love it l,size is great to carry in your purse which i love..comes with a nive little case too..deff recomend buying it.</li>
    <li> the design is cute but not pratical. I tried using this on the go and was not satisified with my shave. I did the water on the go and it was awful. Ive tried it with shaving cream and still my skin feels dry and not smooth. ive never tried venus as a razor and I am not impressed. I did like how small it is, I found it easier to quickly shave. I received this for testing purposes thanks to influenster.</li>
    <li> This product is great! The SNAP is perfect for on the go. It fits great in your purse, make up bag or gym bag for when you need to shower when your not hope or your out and its cold so your legs get a bit prickly. No one wants to carry around a full size razor! The Gillette Venus company never disappoints!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this from my husbands account since I can&#x27;t leave reviews from mine. I received this as a free product from Influenster to test. I like how easy it is to travel with. I did not like how tiny the handle was though. It makes it harder to use and I couldn&#x27;t really get a good grip on it. But I guess for travel on the go purposes that&#x27;s what you get with compact size.</li>
    <li> This product is great to take with you wherever you go. It fits perfectly in almost all purses/bags. The razor leaves your skin smooth to the touch. I definitely recommend this razor to all females as a necessity to take with you at all times!</li>
    <li> Great! Small and easy to travel with! I like that it comes with a case to keep it safe! My legs feels so smooth and it was so easy to you. It just glides right along. So glad I was able to try it, thanks to my free sample from Influenster! :) I&#x27;d totally purchase this!</li>
    <li> This is something that you will want to get if you travel a lot or go to the gym the case is nice and hard dose not come open in your bag</li>
    <li> While you certainly don&#x27;t get a discount for it&#x27;s small size, I found this razor to be perfect for travel. I did receive this razor free from Influenster to try, but I&#x27;ve used and loved regular Venus razors in the past.  So if you love Venus razors in the first place, this is everything you like about that, just the mini version. It fits the regular sized razor blade head, so no buying special blades just for this. It packs easily, and comes in a great little case, which is the hardest part I&#x27;ve found about packing a razor. The case is vented on the bottom, so it should air dry/drain any moisture after use easily. Definitely convenient, and I&#x27;ll keep this permanently packed in my weekend bag!</li>
    <li> I received the Venus Snap razor for testing purposes from Influenster. I love how easy the razor is to take anywhere. It comes in an adorable little travel case and is only about two inches in length. It gives the great close shave that you expect from Venus razors. All the blades fit it too. It made my legs soft but I would admit that I wish that it would have come with the Embrace Sensitive blades instead.</li>
    <li> I received this Gillette Venus Snap Razor to try out from Influenster. I like that design and idea of the razor. The razor is easy to take on vacations or weekend getaways. I enjoy the razor case which provides safe storage so you can toss in any bag and go. I have very sensitive skin so no razor including this one seems to not break me out. I enjoy this however for shaving my underarms more than I do my legs. Thank you Influenster for the chance to try this product out and review for others!</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Venus Snap with Embrace from Influenster to sample! This is a great on the go product! It&#x27;s better than carrying a regular razor and it comes with a cool carrying case that fits perfectly in a purse or beach bag. The razor provided me with a smooth shave. I will be purchasing replacement blades so I can take the razor with me on summer trips! ‪</li>
    <li> This razor is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried! It makes my legs so soft and smooth! And omg the convenience! I take this in my purse. Girls you know when you miss a spot but youve already left your house? This is perfect for that! I will not use any other razor Eve</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so tiny it fits everywhere. I&#x27;m definitely using this every time I&#x27;m on the go. And thanks to influenster I got to try it for free.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for traveling or if you need to just throw it in your purse, bag or make up bag; my legs are usually very sensitive to razors because of the gel strip however the Venus Snap is the only razor, thus far, to not make me break out or itch!</li>
    <li> received a Complimentary  sample from Influenster. Love the fact that it small and compact, fit anywhere. Leaves a nice smooth shave. #InASnap</li>
    <li> I received this courtesy of influenster for testing purposes and it works great for on the go. It fits in my purse and gym bag perfectly. The only thing I wish is that the case had room for an extra razor blade. But otherwise I love it! Thanks influenster and Gillette Venus.</li>
    <li> This razor is awesome!!! i have sensitive skin, and i usually get razor burn from razors, but not with this!! it works wonderfully, and left my legs very smooth! i also love the size! it fits perfectly in your hand, and is small enough to easily shave all the hard spots, like behind your knee! I only had to use a little bit of water to get the gel to come from the blade, and i used no shaving cream. it really is excellent to keep in your purse for those days you forget to shave. just find some water, and your good to go!</li>
    <li> Got this little razor thru the influenster program and I love it. I didn&#x27;t even use water and  it works good on my legs. Nice and smooth. Will buy another when I have to too bad I lost the coupon</li>
    <li> I was sent the Venus Snap from Influenster for review purposes. I haven&#x27;t used a Venus razor in about 10 years and wasn&#x27;t a fan back then so I was wary of testing the Snap. I&#x27;d been using dollar store razors off and on plus switching back to a Schick razor every now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I gave this a chance because I like the Venus blades much better now than I did 10 years ago. As far as the handle goes, this is perfect for travel. Pop it in your bag or backpack, or even your pocket if you&#x27;re in a pinch! Though it&#x27;s a travel razor, you still need a little bit of water to shave but since the razor has a lotion strip, you no longer need shaving cream or gel and that makes things a little easier, especially when travelling. All in all, I highly recommend it and if you don&#x27;t use a Venus razor I definitely recommend making the switch! :)</li>
    <li> I received this razor from an Influenster promotional vox box.  I am glad I tried the razor.  I took it on a trip and it was a great addition to my travel bag.  I like that it came with a case, I don&#x27;t have to worry about reaching into my bathroom kit.  I ran out of shaving cream while using it the first time and it worked great with some conditioner I had with me.  It was a nice smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always in a hurry to get out the door and to where ever I&#x27;m going and I always seem to wait to shave my legs last minute which for me means missing spots, this fit perfectly in my purse and i just use a wet cloth and fix anything I mistakenly left behind. Its compact and works very well.</li>
    <li> I received this razor complimentary from Influenster for reviewing purposes. I was really excited to get it and try it out. The case it comes in is super cute and does not break easily, which I really liked! I was a bit disappointed that it didn&#x27;t have some sort of soap or shaving cream built in since it is a travel razor, but it didn&#x27;t break the bank for me. I liked how it glided with my skin and helped shave sensitive areas like my underarms. I will definitely purchase refills and continue to use this razor since we are living in a hotel for at least another month until our military housing is ready. It fits perfectly in our soap dish and I couldn&#x27;t ask for more out of a razor!</li>
    <li> I love this product, after receiving it  i made a road trip to mexico and i took my razor, its the cutest thing ever the box help your cloth be safe from the blades and it fits everywhere you put it  I will  but  another one forsure</li>
    <li> I received Venus Snap as a complimentary product from Influenster for testing purposes and I have to say I love it. My fianc&amp;eacute; and I went on a long weekend vacation over Memorial Day weekend so it was a perfect time to test out this product. Its compact size was perfect for travel, and I was able to pack it nicely in my small makeup bag. Using this product was just as easy as using a full size razor, and left me with equally smooth skin. The widened end of the handle makes for a nice place to grip, without making you feel like you&#x27;re missing the long handle of a full size razor. I would definitely recommend this product to others. Thank you Influenster!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous razors before, but never found one quite like this one. The area that gives me the most trouble when shaving, is my bikini area. I have a hard time with most razors contouring to the shape and getting every little hair, which drives me insane. The Venus Snap is the answer to this issue. The flexibility of the head allows it to glide easily over the area and the petite size makes it easier to handle than the standard razor. Plus it comes in the cute little traveling case. I absolutely love this razor and plan to continue using it. Thank you to influenster for providing this item free of charge.</li>
    <li> Whoever created the Venus Snap was doing it right. It is Genius! The convenience is bliss! I received the product compliments of Influenster and it could not have been at a better time! It&#x27;s graduation season and I&#x27;m constantly on the go between grad parties and events and I get to do it with smooth skin! Although it&#x27;s small it provides an amazing close and smooth shave! Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> i love my Venus snap with Embrace! its so easy to take with me everywhere i go! i just throw it in my purse and we&#x27;re ready to go! i love having it with me all the time, cuz i hate when im out of the house wearing a cute pair of shorts and then i discover i missed a spot shaving in the shower!! and with my Venus snap with Embrace those details are so easy to fix!</li>
    <li> This razor is convenient and works like a charm! I travel a lot for my job so it is great to be able to throw my razor in my purse so that I can shave as soon as I feel any stubble. The compact is a great design because it allows for any water to drain out of the case if you keep the razor in the shower. The compact is also small enough that it doesn&#x27;t take up much space. I also think that the small design make shaving the tricky spots on your body easier! Overall I would recommend this product to anyone considering it and I will continue to sing its praises!</li>
    <li> I received the Snap Razor as part of a VoxBox with Influenster.  I have to say, I didn&#x27;t think it would be a decent razor since it was so small.  Boy was I wrong.  I took it to the lake since it was small, portable, and had a cool container too! It was easy to bring down to the dock shower with me.  I shaved right there and it left me with a very nice, clean shave.  It is perfect to have in your purse, gym bag, or wherever you go.  So glad I was able to try it out!  Everyone should get one.</li>
    <li> I love this razor! Usually they&#x27;re hard to rinse out, but the back makes it so easy and quick. It&#x27;s so small that you can bring it anywhere, but it still has five blades and shaves really close. This is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used, but sometimes it can be hard to grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received my Gillette Venus Snap Razor complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! Not only was it incredibly easy to use but it is so easy to put into my purse and travel with it! If I ever have a few loose strands of hair I am able to immediately shave them off!</li>
    <li> Went on a surprise overnight stay, after 2 days of not shaving my legs I was very unprepared for what I was hoping was going to happen... Then I remembered I had this bad boy in my purse! Woot!! Saved me from exfoliating someone else&#x27;s skin with my hairy legs! ;)</li>
    <li> I received this complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I just boughy another one for my bff for a birthday gift. Love is an understatement for this product! I keep mine in my bag for traveling. Great razor to keep you feeling smooth through summer.</li>
    <li> I like this razor best for traveling. It is not a heavy duty type. I would use this for underarm and legs. I&#x27;m blessed not to have hair legs so it works great for the size of the product.</li>
    <li> Love the Gillette Venus snap it&#x27;s great this come in handy I&#x27;m a first time user I received it from #influenster for test I&#x27;m in love with it just perfect #inasnap is just ready it did me good I love it I can carried it any Where doesn&#x27;t take up space it&#x27;s small nd just perfect if I loved it you will too: )</li>
    <li> THIS IS A SPONSORED POST; INFLUENSTER PROVIDED THE GILLETTE VENUS SNAP WITH EMBRACE RAZOR TO ME AS A MEMBER OF INFLUENSTER.COM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this razor from influenster, luckily just in time since I&#x27;ll be going on vacation in a couple of weeks. I decided to give it a try to test it out for my upcoming trip, and it has its good and bad points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Comes with its own storage container so theres no need for a plastic bag or anything, smaller so it takes up less space, nice close shave, cute packaging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Handle is a little difficult to get used to (but becomes easier to deal with), I did need to use shaving cream because I have extremely sensitive skin..which gets really irritated by shaving on a good day, and definitely did not like going without shave cream. The moisturizing strip on the razor alone just wasnt enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a good product, but I&#x27;ll still bring shave cream along with it.</li>
    <li> I really liked this razor.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got it from Influenster for free and I&#x27;m really glad because I&#x27;ll definitely be buying couple more for my maid of honor and bride&#x27;s maids.&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this razor are three things: It comes in a little box so you can just throw it in into your purse, you can pick whichever Gillette Venus blade you like, and if you pick those with built-in shaving cream bars you just need water, so this little thing is great for on the go!&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to know more check out my blog! :) Link is here -&gt;  [...]</li>
    <li> Small compact razor for travel.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor for travel as it is very compact.  It is also easy to find Venus blade refills for it; I was even able to find them overseas.</li>
    <li> I love this little razor!  Very handy to keep in my purse for those times when you realize you didn&#x27;t shave...and need to.  It only comes with one refill, though, which doesn&#x27;t make it a very good value. I got it with a $4 off Amazon coupon, but wouldn&#x27;t pay full price for it.</li>
    <li> These are great for the price!</li>
    <li> does the job.  great for travel</li>
    <li> Perfect travel razor.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love it.  It&#x27;s perfect for travel, but it is difficult if not dangerous to shave with.  It&#x27;s hard to get the angles of the sides and backs of legs.  Easy to nick yourself.  Too bad</li>
    <li> With a box, easy to use at home or on trips</li>
    <li> The razor itself is great - I love how compact it is and it does great on my sensitive skin leaving behind no bumps of cuts. Gets a close shave that lasts. The only downside is the expensive refill cartridges. Other than that - the overall razor itself gets an A. Thank you Influenster for the complimentary razor to test!</li>
    <li> This is PERFECT for traveling....seriously the best! Light and compact and totally amazing!! The only thing that would make this 5 Stars is if it had the ability to make itself bigger.....Its not really good for at home use.</li>
    <li> Love that it comes in a compact case and is discreet. It is easy to slip into your purse or travel bag and do touch ups on the go. I absolutely love this product. I literally have to shave everyday and this takes care of everything that I miss!</li>
    <li> This razor is great for throwing in your bag before a trip. It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room, which is great! It gave me a nice, close shave.. It is very comparable to any other Venus razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved razors, so when Influenster sent me this is one of their voxboxes, I was super excited! I also happened to get this right before going to the lake on Memorial Day weekend! This razor was so convenient and also gave me a super close shave, with no razor bumps or cute. I recommend this razor to anyone...especially to those who travel or go to the gym a lot.</li>
    <li> I am so busy between my full time cosmotologist job and just everyday things. Its small and compact, it can go anywhere with you! I have really sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all. It is super smooth and a close shave! I recommend this to any busy woman that loves smoothness and closeness when they shave! Fits perfectly with any busy lifestly and I will be recommending it to all my freinds :)</li>
    <li> I love this little razor. It&#x27;s small and comes in a little carrying case but does the work of a big razor. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> I received this razor complimentary from Influenster. As a mom of a small child, I rarely find time to shave my legs any more. I found this razor to be easy to use in a quick situation. It didn&#x27;t leave me bloody like the cheap razors I have been using before. I will probably keep buying refills so that I can continue to use it, especially since we&#x27;re going to be moving soon.</li>
    <li> The handle is shaped perfectly to fit in my hand and the grip makes sure it doesn&#x27;t slip. A great product for on the run or a home. Compact and saves space.</li>
    <li> I got this received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I love this razor. It is cute and it does the job of leaving your skin baby smooth. I recommend it for all the ladies out there.  This razor is convenient when you are on the go.</li>
    <li> i really like this razor, not only because its great for traveling, but it also leave a clean shave and not one hair was missed. this is a great product and i would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about you but I carry a full size razor with me everywhere. This new gadget is perfect for me and for you! I can throw my compact in my purse and go. The razor stays safe and clean! When I forget to shave, I am in a rush or even going on vacation, Venus snap always has my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features**&lt;br /&gt;•Mini handle that’s easy to grip and convenient to store&lt;br /&gt;•Embrace’s 5 blades to get virtually every hair&lt;br /&gt;•Water activated Ribbon of Moisture for a smooth glide&lt;br /&gt;•Fits ANY cartridge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it. So worth trying!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would ever use this razor when I saw it in stores. Influenster‬ sent me the ‪InAsnap‬ ‪voxbox‬ and I gave it a try. Now I absolutely love my razor. The size is a different than why I&#x27;m use to, so it took a while for me to start liking it. But the shave was so close that it helped me grow to like it more. I will definitely use the inasnap razor for on the go, and I will definitely be buying Gillette razors from now on.</li>
    <li> I choose all stars because this razor is great for a busy day , when you forget to shave , so easy and smart for it being so tiny which makes it easier to get in any bathroom and shave those unwanted hairs away . I like how convenient it is and how smooth it shaves. Dislike the price a little. I&#x27;ll recommend this to anybody who shaves and don&#x27;t like to see a tad bit of hair peeking through</li>
    <li> Perfect for on the go, your gym bag, car, ir virtually anywhere. Not the best shave, but it can get you by until you get home</li>
    <li> Received the product from Influenster and I must say I&#x27;m really impressed! It&#x27;s compact, handy and effective and perfect for those who love to travel and are constantly on the go :)</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to get to try the Gillette Venus Snap with Embrace free (Influenster sent me one complimentary for testing purposes!) It&#x27;s supposed to be super convenient for shaving on the go, and it does come with a convenient carrying case. I&#x27;m always on the go so I loved the idea of this product. I tried it out using just water, since it claims you don&#x27;t need any shave gel. I wet the razor head really well and wet my leg before shaving, but even though I used water it stung to shave. I ended up with razor burn like crazy because I used it to shave my whole leg. And because it hurt while I was shaving, I couldn&#x27;t get a very close shave and the hair grew back really quickly -- faster than with other razors. The next time I tried it, I rubbed the blue part of the head on my wet leg before I touched the metal blade to my skin, and that helped a little, but it still wasn&#x27;t an ideal experience (it still hurt, so I still didn&#x27;t get a super close shave.) The third time I used the Gillette Venus Snap with Embrace, I used it in my own bathroom and used body wash on my leg to lubricate before shaving. Then I got a painless, super close and smooth shave, and the hair grew back much more slowly! I have used it since without any shave gel JUST for touch-ups, like when I&#x27;m on the go and realize I missed a strip of hair. So I wouldn&#x27;t depend on this to shave your entire leg if you don&#x27;t plan to use anything to lube them up first. But in a pinch on the go, go for it! (I usually have at least a tube of hand lotion in my purse anyway, so you probably can find something to protect your skin for use on the go. Even handsoap in the public ladies bathroom would do the trick!) I WAS NOT COMPENSATED FOR THIS POST, HOWEVER I DID RECEIVE A SAMPLE FOR MY REVIEW.  ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN AND NOT INFLUENCED IN ANY WAY.</li>
    <li> Compact,great for travel and doesn&#x27;t clutter the shower.  Works just like its full size sister.</li>
    <li> Fine for travel, not bad in general. I prefer the full size handle, but sometimes you just need the little one. Quality blades as always with this brand.</li>
    <li> Very convenient. Love the carry case it comes in. I like that I can put any venus razor I prefer on it. No more packing my razors in plastic baggies!</li>
    <li> The razor with the enclosed case is perfect for my gym bag.</li>
    <li> A great travel razor, the case opens easily.</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel. My daughter took this with her on a cruise and loved it. She did not have a problem with the handle being shorter than a normal size razor and it shaved just as well as what she usually uses.</li>
    <li> very convenient for travel and replacement parts are compatible with my regular razor</li>
    <li> Pretty cool little venus razor for travel.  I was always annoyed by the larger razor when traveling.  This one comes with a cute case.</li>
    <li> Cute little razor that I plan to take with me when I go on vacations.  I love that it has a nice little case to go with it, too.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great companion for travel and gym. I love the compact case, so it easily slips into the pocket of a bag and you don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting yourself rummaging for it. I actually bought some for my friend and a 2nd one for myself (one now is a permanent fixture in my gym bag the other for travel). I also actually prefer the shorter handle for the bikini line. And the cherry on top is that you can replace the blade with regular venus razor heads.</li>
    <li> This razor is ok, honestly besides its compact size there isn&#x27;t anything else that makes it great. I found it hard to hold in the shower &amp; easily slides off the side of the tub/ledge. Would not buy again for a trip.</li>
    <li> Expensive.  Close shave with no cuts.  On time.</li>
    <li> The are great! i find them much more ergonomic than the typical loner handled version. They are much easier to use, and I find I have fewer nicks because the shorter handle is much easier to grip and manuever. I only buy these now because they use the same size blades as the longer handles.</li>
    <li> This is a nice razor that is comfortable to use despite it&#x27;s small size. I recommend it to everyone who travels often.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife, who already uses a full size Gillette Venus razor at home, so this one has been her travel razor.  The cartridges are the exact same as her existing razor so there&#x27;s only one overpriced pack of cartridges to purchase.  She says the Snap is easy to use in the shower, and it comes with a clam shell case for storage while traveling.  In this modern day it amazes me how manufacturers produce razors that are pure garbage, but at least this one seems to be a step in the right direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied a $3 coupon at the time of purchase in late October, and I now see there&#x27;s a $5 coupon available that effectively cuts the price in half, so we may get another while the value is decent.</li>
    <li> Not comfortable for me</li>
    <li> Works well and handle is more comfortable than I expected. Good product to keep in your travel bag. Wouldn&#x27;t use it all the time, but perfect for travel, especially with the case.</li>
    <li> Great size and very easy-to-use.  It conforms to your hand to give you a nice clean shave.</li>
    <li> Very handy for traveling</li>
    <li> This product is so small and fits right into your purse, overnight bag, whatever. Don&#x27;t let the size fool you though, the Gillette Venus Snap is very easy to grip and hold on to. It also gives you a smooth, clean, feel after you shave. I really enjoy it. It&#x27;s the only razor I&#x27;m using right now because it works so well! I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I loved everything about this razor! It&#x27;s not too small, and not too big for on the go! I can keep in discretely in my purse &amp; easy fix that &amp;#34;Uh-oh I forgot a spot&amp;#34; moments! I think this is a must to keep in your purse,makeup bag, or even in your car ladies!</li>
    <li> Ireceived this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. but msut say I love the compact size for traveling or transport, though the carrying case makes the overall product take up space that is comparable to other disposable-head razors; Swivel head contours very well to curves of leg muscles versus stationary-head razors;</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Venus Snap with Embrace Woman&#x27;s Razor from Influenster in My VoxBox and i am very impressed! i really like the flexible razor head and i absolutely love that it has FIVE blades!it&#x27;s wonderful to take literally anywhere!i am looking forward to taking it camping with me but it&#x27;s also great to just carry in your purse for those &amp;#34;oops i forgot to shave&amp;#34; moments</li>
    <li> Absolutely love how smooth it makes me feel and how tiny and compact it is! Definitely work checking out trading in my shick Quattro now</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great if you travel a lot. Or are constantly on the go.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very small and can be kept conveniently in almost any place. But it is very small and I would not suggest using it as an every day razor. Also, if you have sensitive legs it may not be for you. But sometimes lotion can help with the dryness.</li>
    <li> I love the convenience of this travel-sized razor. I wear glasses and am blind in the shower so I like that this is small enough that you can keep it in your purse if you ever miss hair. The case has an open air system so that moisture will not become trapped. Finally, you can get a smooth shave using only water with this razor, which means its perfect for on the go, and you don&#x27;t have to pack shaving cream when you travel.</li>
    <li> While I was at first unsure of how easy this razor would be to handle, I found myself pleasantly surprised. It is easy to use, and also would fit easily into a travel bag to use on the go! It works very well.</li>
    <li> This razor is a MUST for all women!! Perfect to throw in your purse when you&#x27;re on the go. It&#x27;s already come in handy a few times on my way out the door noticing I missed a spot that morning shaving. As a woman you know any hair on your leg is not a cute look when wearing shorts or skirts during warm weather. Thanks to influenster for letting me test it out!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t shave on the go so I can&#x27;t comment on that aspect but I love the Venus brand as I already use their products regularly. This Venus Snap was perfect for me...I thought it gave me more control of the razor versus the bigger sizes. I got done faster than usual. I love that is has a protective case for travel. Good job Venus.</li>
    <li> I am famous for missing a spot on my legs and realizing it when I&#x27;m already put and about. Snap with embrace is genius and so convient because it fits nicely in my purse or gym bag. It&#x27;s not a hassle to carry with me and it definitely comes in handy when I realize I missed a patch of hair.</li>
    <li> I love this its so small and compact it fits easlt into a purse or travel bag with out taking up much room absolutely amazing for traveling. I would and have most definitely recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> Im in love with this product it is sooo convenient discrete and easy to use I just throw it in my bag and gooooo leaves my legs soft and silky smooth my new go to shaver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS A SPONSORED POST; INFLUENSTER PROVIDED GILLETTE VENUS SNAP PRODUCT FOR TESTING AND REVIEWING PURPOSES ONLY TO ME AS A MEMBER OF INFLUENSTER.COM</li>
    <li> *Complimentary from Influenster for testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the razor for traveling. I would still use my regular razor though but this is a nice razor when you need to use a razor anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s overpriced though. It&#x27;s about $9 or $10 at target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it looks and that it comes with a case. Has a lot of blades and the strips too.</li>
    <li> I love this razor! The mini size makes it incredibly easy to take anywhere, and despite it&#x27;s small size, it has an extra wide handle that makes it really easy to grip. I was nervous that this razor would nick my skin, but it works really well without cutting me! I would recommend this razor to anyone and everyone.</li>
    <li> I received this razor complimentary through Influenster. It works well, even on dry skin (just wet the razor first) and comes with a nice carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s slightly harder to handle than a regular sized razor but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the angle.&lt;br /&gt;Interchangeable with your other Venus razor blades which is always a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only &amp;#34;negative&amp;#34; I have about this product is that it is advertised to be great for travel and on-the-go; however, I don&#x27;t find that it takes up any less space than a standard disposable razor, should I want to toss it in my purse.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Venus Snap with Embrace razor complimentary from Influenster. Prior to using the Venus Snap razor, I had been using the Schick Quattro razor for nearly 5 years. While I love the Quattro and have had no problems with its efficiency or closeness, the shave I was achieved with the Venus Snap was unmatched. My legs are soft, smooth, and moisturized after using the Venus Snap for 1 week--something I struggled to feel with the Schick Quattro. I have been extremely happy with my new razor and will only be purchasing the Venus razors in the future. Thanks, Influenster!</li>
    <li> Great little razor to take with you. Same good quality as full size and comes with a nice little plastic case.</li>
    <li> I love this compact razor.  It is easy to handle and leaves my legs feeling good really smooth with the lotion cream strip that&#x27;s on the razor. I would highly recommend this razor to anyone on the go because it fits anywhere.</li>
    <li> My favorite razor in a travel form! Its a good razor in general and does the job. The small handle is not bad to use because of it&#x27;s grip. It comes with a little container to hold it in which will come in handy when traveling. I would recommend it for travel use.</li>
    <li> It works amazingly, but only if you&#x27;re using it in the shower with shaving cream. I&#x27;ll admit that it looks super cute and fits great in my gym bag, but when I did use it at the gym I ended up with sections of my leg with razor burn. Ouch! However, these things are a bit pricey for a razor so I decided to give it another shot. I used it at home with my normal shaving routine and it works fantastically. SO while it fits in your purse or gym bag really well, I would not recommend it for it&#x27;s intended on-the-go use unless you don&#x27;t mind carrying shaving cream as well.</li>
    <li> This product comes with the quality you expect from the Venus brand but it is a little cumbersome to use. Because Venus has sharp razors (which is a good thing), I felt like I would lose control of the razor with a shorter handle. Perhaps this is just a personal preference? The convenience factor is nice though. I brought it to a bachelorette party and it came in handy to have in my bag.</li>
    <li> Great razor i got to try it out thanks to Influenster for testing purposes in a vobox and i love it the only downside is  the blades cost so much for a refill!</li>
    <li> At first I thought this seemed like a waste but once I got the chance to try it I actually do like it. The mini handle has a good grip and makes it easy to handle. The blade is the same size so the only thing different about this and the other Venus razors is the handle size. I really like the container it comes I&#x27;m bc that&#x27;s what makes it easy to tote around.</li>
    <li> I received a free Snap razor and used it the same day. It comes in a little case which makes it perfect for traveling and keeping it in your purse. Very convenient.</li>
    <li> Love this little gem! Close smooth shave and the size is perfect to stash in my purse for those just in case moments ;)</li>
    <li> easy on the go razor, smooth clean shave. love it, convenient and compact. def recommend it, blades are sharp and moisturize and this cute little case makes it easy to mask and have conveniently in my purse.</li>
    <li> As someone who has been using a two-blade razor for YEARS, I found this to be one of the best razors I have ever tried. In the past whenever I used any razor with more than 2 blades I would basically flay myself. The short handle actually made me feel like I had more control, and the result was an incredibly close shave and very smooth legs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WAS NOT COMPENSATED FOR THIS POST, HOWEVER I DID RECEIVE A SAMPLE FOR MY REVIEW.  ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN AND NOT INFLUENCED IN ANY WAY,</li>
    <li> Love this razor!! Convenient and the precision is awesome! Purse/diaper bag must have!!! Will definitely be buying again and refills!</li>
    <li> This is a must have for anyone on the go. I found out about this product from Influenster and was fortunate to try it in their itsasnap voxbox. It is super convenient for a gym bag or traveling. It comes with a small hard case to conceal the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WAS NOT COMPENSATED FOR THIS POST, HOWEVER I DID RECEIVE A SAMPLE FOR MY REVIEW.  ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN AND NOT INFLUENCED IN ANY WAY.</li>
    <li> Love it! So compact and easy to use!  I just throw it in my bag and go! Great for your unexpected beach trips!</li>
    <li> Great for on the go emergencies or touching up on missed hairs, but not the best for at home use. I say that mainly because there isn&#x27;t much to hold on to for control of your shave with the small handle. It is great to carry for on the go, however! I received mine complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, can&#x27;t beat a free razor!</li>
    <li> I think this is a perfect razor for college students/people that travel a lot and want a portable razor that works well. The no slip grip on this allows me to hold onto the razor nicely, and I like that any gillette attachment can be added onto the end, so you can bring any of your favorite attachments on the go. I overall felt that the razor worked well, but I do prefer a longer band as it allows me to shave easier. But this is perfect for on the go or quick touch-ups. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I recieved this razor complimentary from Influenster for review and testing purposes and I absolutely love it! At first, I thought that it would be difficult to hold because of how tiny it is compared to a normal sized razor, but, it actually felt super comfortable to use! It gave me a smooth, close shave and it left my legs feeling very moisturized!&lt;br /&gt;I love the portable container that it comes in; i&#x27;ve been taking it to the gym and keeping it in my purse ever since I recieved it from Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, I have recommended it to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I received the Venus Snap complimentary to try out and review. It is very light weight  and comes with its own case. It is a little awkward to hold, and even though the handle has a rubber grip on it I did drop it quite a bit. I was a little nervous the it was going to be flimsy and cut me up, but it was’t. I love that it has 5 blades to get a smooth, close shave when you are on the go. The case seems durable, but I couldn’t really test how it packs on the go because I had not where to go :)  It would also be good for those nights you need a quick shave, like when you get invited out last minute or if you for got to shave. All you have to do is use water and shave and your are good to go. The Gillette Venus Snap is a great product and I would recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> I love the cute design and the packaging of the Venus Snap with Embrace. I&#x27;ve also never used a razor with more than three blades, so I was really curious how it would hold up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I tried without my usual shaving cream, since the card I got in the mail with the razor said that was possible. However, I have dry skin on my legs, and after a couple of tries, it ended up being too painful to continue. This was an issue for me because even if I did want to use it on the go, I would have to also carry some sort of soap or shaving cream because the moisture strip on the blade wouldn&#x27;t be enough. But using it in the shower with my usual shaving cream was great, and I got a super clean shave! I noticed that the head was flexible and almost conformed to the shape of your leg to get the closest shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest concern is that the handle is so small, and the rubbery grip isn&#x27;t as easy to hold onto as a regular handle (especially when your hand is slippery with shaving cream). There were a couple of times I was afraid the razor would slip while I was shaving, and I would cut myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think this was a fine idea, especially for those who travel a lot, but I&#x27;m not sure I would repurchase over a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Influenster for sending me this product to test! ‪All opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I got it free in my Influenster box.  I love it! I thought it would be hard to shave with because the handle is small.  It was not. It was like using a regular big Gillette Venus razor. I will be buying it ever time I go on a trip. I love that it has a case for it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Snap razor. I was skeptical at first because it was so small and shaving on the go has never been easy for me. I have sensitive legs and I need a lot of soap or shave cream when shaving so my legs don&#x27;t get irritated afterwards. when I opened it I loved the case it comes in so I can throw it in my purse with no worries. i went to a friends house and remembered it was in my purse when i went to the restroom and thought what a perfect time to try it out. i just splashed some warm water on it and shaved both legs over the sink in about 3 mins total..my legs were smoother than they are when i shave in shower. i had NO irritation at all. i love this razor and i have been telling all my girlfriends about it since i used it the first time! Perfection!!!! i was very happy to receive this complimentary from Influenster for testing out..</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Venus Snap complimentary of Influenster for testing purposes so I also cant comment about the price.&lt;br /&gt;I thought the compact was cute, and with plenty of water, it doesnt tug on your skin while shaving. The length of handle doesnt bother me like it does with some reviewers, but its the angle that it&#x27;s at which makes it slightly difficult to get a close shave. I also like the blue moisturizer around the blades, so that I dont have to use cream to shave when i&#x27;m on the go. If I have been offered the razor for testing purposes, I&#x27;d take it, but I wouldnt buy it without coupons to help lower the cost for only one razor.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I received it complementary from Influenster for testing purposes and it is perfect for on-the-go. The two things that I love most about it are that it comes in a case and that it uses the same razor heads as all of their other razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I love the case because you don&#x27;t have to worry about keeping up with those disposable little plastic things that keep your blades from cutting you when you throw them in your suitcase. The case is made of a hard plastic so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it breaking. With the case, you also don&#x27;t have to worry about the blade scratching your clothes or you when you reach your hand in your suitcase to pull stuff out. It is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I love that the blade heads are the same as all of their other razors because that means that you don&#x27;t have to worry about buying a refill just for your travel razor. Most people would say that they would rather just buy a disposable razor or take their normal razor on-the-go. But after using this, you will love it. Especially if you are going on a trip for one or two days, why would you waste a whole razor on that short amount of time. With this one, you can use it over and over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this razor a few weeks ago and I used it this past weekend while I was a bridesmaid in a wedding. It was perfect for this occasion and I plan to take it with me to the beach a lot this summer. Everyone will be hollering at my silky smooth legs...</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product from Influenster to test and it came just in time for the first weekend of camping. It was the perfect size and the little case was great to carry it in. What I liked most about this product was how easy it was to just pull out and do a quick touch up on a section of my leg I had missed while shaving earlier that day. I would highly recommend this product, I myself just bought refill pack for my own!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the perfect on the go razor! It&#x27;s small enought to not be in the way or take up too much space while packing but not so small that it&#x27;s hard to hold. I love the one I have! It makes my legs feel super smooth and i love the little case that comes with it!!</li>
    <li> I recieved this razor in my influenster voxbox and I can say it&#x27;s one of the best razors I&#x27;ve used! Despite the small size, it is easy to use and offers a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> This little buddy is great for a quick touch up.  I constantly am going from work to shows or out on a night on the town, and this guy is a life saver. The shave is so smooth, and so close. It leaves the skin soft too! It seriously is a wonder! I don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;ll be able to live without it now!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I have received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I got this item from Influenster for testing purposes. This Gillette Venus product is perfect for busy college students like myself. Whether you&#x27;re out in public or at home, this razor is quick and easy to use when you are on the go! I can store the snap razor in my bag because it comes with its own carrying case. Absolutely love this product!</li>
    <li> i love this. very small and fits right in a small bag when going out or even if you traveling.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s much different than their other razors just more compact. I do enjoy gilette razors but I don&#x27;t often purchase them because they cost so much more than the typical cheapie razors. I like that this is tiny and has a little case. perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> Got this shaver for free from Influenster. I loved how compact it is. That it fits easily in my purse. I have always loved the Venus products especially since their shavers have that lotion layer that helps with dings and cuts. Shavers that don’t have that protection always seem to make my legs get cut up where I start bleeding. I feel this shaver is perfect for travel fits right in my makeup case. This shaver makes my legs feel nice and smooth glad that I can use the same refills as the other Venus refillable shavers.</li>
    <li> I really liked this razor. It&#x27;s small size made it super easy for me to just throw into my bag before I went to an audition or when I went to class. I always see spots that I missed when I&#x27;m out and always feel self conscious about them. Now I can easily slip into the bathroom and fix the spots! The only downside was that it did take some time to get used to the small handle.</li>
    <li> My ABSOLUTE favorite razor. It&#x27;s so convenient and I love the fact that you can use any razor with the Venus snap.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I love how close it feels. I Love that it feels like i am shaving with lotion.&lt;br /&gt;This is very worth the price!</li>
    <li> Because summer is full of adventure, the venus snap is great for traveling. It is compact and convenient, but the best part is that it doesn&#x27;t not require shaving cream! Pack it in your luggage and enjoy your vacation worry-free!</li>
    <li> This razor is great.  It has the features of a full sized razor in an easy to use mini form.  I was pleasantly surprised by the case design.  Gillette really thought this one through.  It is transparent enough to be able to identify if the razor is in the case, it has small holes to let water out and allow razor to dry, hopefully before you throw it in with your stuff.  It is tough, I dropped it and it did not break.  All in all, great razor with a thought out case.  I received it free to try from Influenster.</li>
    <li> I love the close, smooth shave it provides but it did cause some irritation.  I also enjoy the small size of the razor, I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Ladies ladies ladies (and I suppose perhaps gentleman too) this is hands down the greatest little bugger I have ever received compliments of Influenster yet.  I have always been vehemently opposed to shaving whilst not in the shower and the Gillette Venus Snap with Embrace has completely blown my mind.  Just add some water to the razor and you are good to go and the results are unbelievable.  Not only will your skin be smooth and hair free but silky soft too!  I just cannot get over how wonderful this razor is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It snaps into the cutest carrying case that securely closes and you can take anywhere.  You cannot even tell that it is a razor from the outside.  My friends joke around that I&#x27;m carrying everything but the kitchen sink in my bag, but now I really don&#x27;t need the kitchen sink!  Just a bit of water and I&#x27;m all set.  Please try this out and you will not be disappointed.  Whether you need this for travel or in a bind the Venus Snap with Embrace will save you and your beautiful skin :)</li>
    <li> The Venus Snap is awesome for on the go! I have used it for traveling over the weekend, to long vacations! I recommend this to on the go moms, you can really shave anywhere anytime!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this for legs yet, but i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll be a problem. I do love it for the most part for my underarms. It&#x27;s fairly small so going in horizontal shave motions is easier.</li>
    <li> Not easy to use. The handle is hard to hold. I did not like it one bit!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s super cute，love it</li>
    <li> Great Razor for everyday use and for travelling. I bought this to take on a vacation and loved it so much it is all I use. You can purchase replacement blades. It IS SMALL, but I like that it is compact in your hand while shaving. If you like a smaller Razor for you hand, this is for you!! Plus the hand travel case is a NICE bonus if you plan to take this on a trip!</li>
    <li> 3.5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year Gillette Venus marketed a purple lower priced \\&quot;starter\\&quot;/basic Venus razor towards the teen/college set, and now offers this cute and compact Venus Snap.  The Snap *looks* like a fun, travel friendly, convenient product. But is it worth it...?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, not really. At big box stores, the retail is nine ninety-nine (slightly less at about nine-fifty at my local Walmart). I combined a manufacturer coupon plus a rewards card e-coupon at my local Kroger to get this down to just a few dollars - definitely worth the price for just the blade alone. The chunky handle is somewhat difficult to control - I kept holding on to the razor release and was afraid it would pop out! After a week I ended up switching to the normal Venus handle, and I felt the longer handle was easier to maneuver.  I also realized that the Venus handles have a notch about 1/3 of the way down from the razor, where I usually grip on to.  So after years and years of using my razor this way, no wonder the Snap felt strange! The shave itself was alright, but for some reason didn&#x27;t seem as close as when using the normal sized handle (even with the exact same blade). Anyhow, the blue compact is a nice touch especially since the vents allow the razor to air out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a tremendously marked-up price for a \\&quot;cute\\&quot; product. Definitely worth purchasing if on sale, or you have a coupon (be on the look out for  Gillette promos here on Amazon) or perhaps in a gift set. But otherwise, meh... You would be better off getting a full sized Venus razor for less.</li>
    <li> Absolutly love this nightlight. It gives you enough light to see what your doing but not too bright. It is adorable.</li>
    <li> This us the cutest little baby razor.  But it does what it was made to do...shave.  What I love about it is that it is so easy to just throw into your travel bag or gym bag and off you go.  Ladies give this a try, I think you will love it....really.</li>
    <li> Love that it comes with a case, very travel friendly.  Razor is good too!</li>
    <li> Best little razor. Excellent size for travelling. Bought a second one because it was cheaper than buying blades!</li>
    <li> Great little razor! It&#x27;s perfect for fitting into a purse, gym bag, travel bag, etc. I bought it personally for my dorm life coming up this fall. I was happy to see how convenient it is to put in my shower caddy! Would definitely recommend to girls on the go!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this razor.  I keep this razor packed in my suitcase at all times.  The case makes sure that the razor stays dried out so that it doesn&#x27;t rust and get sticky.  It&#x27;s so small that it fits in a little side pocket and now I&#x27;m never without.  I&#x27;m thinking about getting a second one to keep at the office for quick fixes or just in case I missed a spot.</li>
    <li> Love this little razor, it&#x27;s a little awkward to handle at first with the small handle, but overall it&#x27;s great! it&#x27;s tiny and compact to carry around, and a great little razor to do the job.</li>
    <li> I was sent the #InASnap @InfluensterVox box to review the Gillette Venus Snap with Embrace. The Gillette Venus Snap with Embrace is a five blade razor. It comes with one cartridge, but you are able to purchase refill cartridges. It is intended to be for on the go. You literally just wet it and you are good to shave. The Gillette Venus Snap with Embrace also comes with it’s own handy little travel case, making it easy to just throw in your purse or luggage. I did try it out and have to say I am pretty impressed. I am very hesitant when it comes to shaving with only water since I have sensitive skin, but I didn’t get irritated from shaving with it. So excited to be taking this with me on my trip to the beach.</li>
    <li> I received this razor via Influenster in my Venus Snap Voxbox, and it&#x27;s perfect. It proves a close shave that last for days. It&#x27;s also the perfect size for traveling and on the go.</li>
    <li> So tiny and compact that i gan throw it in my purse or diaper bag for on the go emergencies. Love it! I received it complimentary of Influenster for resting purposes.</li>
    <li> For some reason when things come in smaller sizes they are 10 times more adorable to me,well I received this razor complimentary from Influenster and it works wonders for me,my legs are smooth and I can show my legs without feeling like I missed a spot!</li>
    <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. That being said it&#x27;s a good enough product to travel with if you do not want to take a full size razor. It comes with a convenient traveling case. What makes it a good travel to travel with besides the size it the moisture guard it has around the blade. You don&#x27;t need to carry around shaving cream, lotion, or whatever you use to shave with. Just wet the guard and it provides enough moisture to get a good shave. I currently use the Bic Soiel and I love that one because it&#x27;s a closer shave with it only being three blades compared to this 5 blade. The Bic has a more effortless shave in a way that I couldn&#x27;t even feel like I was shaving.</li>
    <li> My first impression on this razor when I recieved it from Influenster was that it was really small. But I just used it on my legs to touch up where my hair is growing back. It left my legs smooth as ever. :) Main reason why I like this, is that it is ideal for travel &amp; easy to carry around. This is so cute, &amp; I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it so far. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I honestly love this razor it&#x27;s so genius! It is great to travel with and practically fits anywhere even in your handbag, beach bag, or luggage. I also love the packaging because it avoids you getting cut in it&#x27;s hard container. I also love the smooth comfortable shave it gives me on the go! It is small but you can still get a comfortable grip on the razor. It is an amazing product and I will definitely keep repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this razor! When I first saw it I thought it was going to be difficult to hold and properly shave because of the size. Boy was I wrong! I actually prefer using this to regular sized razors! I got such a clean and close shave with no razor burn (I ALWAYS get razor burn!)</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s very small and sleek and you can throw it in your purse or bag for those times when you need a little touch up or you&#x27;re going on a trip.&lt;br /&gt;The 5 blades give you that ultra smooth close shave I love love love it definitely recommend purchasing it!</li>
    <li> I forget to shave...a lot. When I do shave, I more often then not forget to shave large areas, and I always miss the same spot no matter how careful I am, to the point where one spot on the back of my leg will look like I&#x27;m trying to cover up the fact I&#x27;m Chewbacca&#x27;s sister or something. But now I can relax, I&#x27;ll be keeping my Venus Snap in the car or my purse, for all of my oops moments and it&#x27;s so compact that it won&#x27;t take up hardly any room. LOVE this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Description:&lt;br /&gt;The Venus Snap is your favorite razor, miniaturized, tucked into a little protective case. The case fits in the palm of your hand, opens like a compact, and the razor itself is the length of your thumb, with the head of a regular razor, so there&#x27;s no need to buy specialty razor heads, just use any Venus razor head.</li>
    <li> This item is small and compact but packs a big punch. I took it on a 4 day beach trip shaved the first day and didn&#x27;t have to shave again. I love this compact razor great for on the go.</li>
    <li> I Love this small venus razor not only because its cute, but it has a case and small enough to fit in my purse!!! way to go venus!!! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> This Is a great product, easy for on the go or traveling. It&#x27;s a great razor with a result of smooth skin. I recommend it to anyone!!</li>
    <li> This razor is very compact ALMOST too compact. I thought I&#x27;d have issues with shaving because it was so small, but I didn&#x27;t. The cute factor of this razor got me in all honesty. It&#x27;s just so cute! I&#x27;ve used disposable razors before for on the go and it doesn&#x27;t work out as nicely as taking this product on the go would. I remember using a disposable razor and having to take it in a clear bag and later losing the clear piece that covers the blade and NOT knowing so when I went to grab it...it wasn&#x27;t pretty. This idea for a more permanent on the go razor is great. The style of the razor makes it a very compact product AND it has a case! I&#x27;ve always like Gillette Venus products and think this is great. May be a bit pricy, but worth it if you&#x27;re on the go a lot! The shave is like any other Gillette Venus razor brand. It&#x27;s close and leaves your skin pretty smooth. The size does not interfere with the quality. Definitely a product worth looking into!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Received Product Complimentary of Influenster.*</li>
    <li> At first I was very nervous about this product but once I used it I absolutely fell inlove with it. The razor leaves a smooth finish and is very gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> I got this razor to review and was able to try it out for free! It has such a nice sleek and compact feel. It allows me to take it on the go. It has five razors which leaves my skin smooth and free of any stubble. I love it and would purchase it. It also comes in a cute compact clear case for easy viewing and nice storage as well.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Venus Snap razor is the perfect size for travel and to have on hand. I carry it in my gym bag daily. The case holds up well and the razor doesn&#x27;t take up too much room in my bag. I also don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting my finger while I&#x27;m digging around my bag. As far as shaving purposes, it is just as good as the regular Venus razor. This smaller version is just for convenience. I&lt;br /&gt;received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes</li>
    <li> I got my venus snap with influnster. I put it in my purse and waited for a time that I would need it. i went out with friends to the beach and noticed I missed a spot on my leg. I used this and it was easy and fast. It is small enough not to take up a buch of space in your purse. It is perfect, smooth, small, and genius. I would definitely purchase.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I love how its small and easy to carry &amp; travel with. It also has a comfy grip and easy to use. The razors gives and very smooth and close shave.</li>
    <li> I have used a ton a razors and Venus always makes my legs feel their best. smooth and nick free is the way to be</li>
    <li> I think this little razor is perfect for on the go. The handle is much smaller, so I don&#x27;t like it for everyday uses, but it does take extra practice. I used to use disposable razors on-the-go before this because I didn&#x27;t want my razor to get ruined. It comes with a case, that has holes so it doesn&#x27;t get gross, the holes are large though, so you have to make sure the razor is not dripping wet before you leave. I love this though because it&#x27;s compact, and the blade is the normal venus blade so it works just like home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WAS NOT COMPENSATED FOR THIS POST, HOWEVER I DID RECEIVE A SAMPLE FOR MY REVIEW.  ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN AND NOT INFLUENCED IN ANY WAY.</li>
    <li> I recieved this for a influenster voxbox &amp; it works great! I love it so much, you can&#x27;t feel anything when it&#x27;s being used. It&#x27;s a great razor I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
    <li> Simply amazing! No shaving cream required. Just wet and use. How convenient is that? So smooth without any cuts or bumps. I received #venussnap complimentary from @influenster for testing purposes. #inasnap #venussnapvoxbox #influenster #voxbox @GilletteVenus</li>
    <li> Love this razor,  love that its so tiny u can take it anywhere with you,  it fits everywhere.  I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I received this complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes! :) So glad that I was able to try such a SMOOTH shaver. It definitely GLIDES on and it even takes away all the thin hair that other shavers cannot. You can embrace the softness of your legs after shaving! The blades are sharp but they do not cut. You can feel them getting every piece of hair, which is awesome. There&#x27;s too much perfectness in such a litter shaver. Oh and I can&#x27;t forget that it&#x27;s the perfect size for travel. Just put it in your bag, when needed take it out - put some water on it, and you&#x27;ll be fresh where ever you go!</li>
    <li> I love this! I use it as my every day razor because it&#x27;s much easier to hold and comfortable than a normal razor, and love the size for my purse!</li>
    <li> It does give you a semi close shave but the blade dulls quickly i dont like the handle though i think its nifty</li>
    <li> I received the Venus Snap from Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;I love how easily this fits in my purse, without taking up a lot of extra space. As a mom, I don&#x27;t always find the time to shave - so it&#x27;s not uncommon for me to be somewhere like church and look down only to realize I haven&#x27;t shaved my legs for a week or so. Having the Venus Snap handy can quickly remedy that, and remove any embarassing hair legs....hopefully before anyone else notices.</li>
    <li> I love my new Venus Snap Razor from @Influenster! It has come in handy so often these past few weeks.  i WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ALL WOMEN OUT THERE!</li>
    <li> I really like this little razor! It&#x27;s perfect for vacations or getaways. It comes with it&#x27;s own little compact case, so the blades won&#x27;t catch on anything and it&#x27;ll stay safe. Because this is a Venus razor, any Venus head will fit on, so once you buy it you don&#x27;t need to buy it again - only razor heads!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I have is that it&#x27;s a little hard to grip because of it&#x27;s size, but being travel-sized makes up for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the Venus Snap razor through Influenster for my review.</li>
    <li> I really like this razor for its portability.  I couldn&#x27;t use it everyday because of its size but it will be nice to take on trips, like camping or something when I can&#x27;t bring a lot of stuff.  I really like that I can use whatever venus razor head I wish with this shaft.  Its great that It&#x27;s customizable too.  Its 5 blades shave nicely especially in the bikini area with course hair.  I got this razor from influenster but these comments are my own.</li>
    <li> I love the Venus Snap. This product is easy to toss in any bag for any getaway!!! Very convenient to have for traveling!</li>
    <li> I love this so much, i normally buy disposable razors because i dont like trying to remember refills. But this razor is so worth it. It comes in a travel case that has small holes on the bottom to help the razor from rusting. It was perfect for the weekend trip i just took. No more disposable for me.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite razor. I am definitely a fan. Worth the money #InASnap will be buying again and again, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> This was great and compact for my recent trip. Didn&#x27;t have to worry about space in my luggage. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I received this product compliments of Influenster for testing purposes. Here is my honest review of the Gillette Venus Snap razor.&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT:&lt;br /&gt;1. NO SHAVING CREAM NEEDED! Just add water to the razor to activate the moisturizing Embrace cartridge and you&#x27;re good to start shaving. The blue border of the cartridge, called the Ribbon Of Moisture, becomes slick and slippery when it becomes wet, gliding effortlessly on your skin.&lt;br /&gt; 2. ANY VENUS CARTRIDGE FITS! Like I said, I have been using my Venus razor for a long while now and it&#x27;s good that I can use the same cartridge on the Venus Snap. And Venus cartridges are really good!&lt;br /&gt; 3. VERY CLOSE SHAVE. Stubble-free, revealing smooth, silky skin.&lt;br /&gt; 4. MOISTURIZED AFTER SHAVING. I did not experience any dryness or itch after shaving. If you have very dry skin, I recommend you to put on a moisturizer after shaving. I use Vaseline Intensive Care lotion.&lt;br /&gt; 5. CONVENIENT. Its tiny, pebble-shaped case slips into purses easily. Whether you&#x27;re carrying a bulky backpack or a chic purse, it would fit. Of course it will never fit in a purse that&#x27;s smaller than the case (duh). It&#x27;s really made to be taken on-the-go. It can also serve as a travel-size razor. It would be great to be taken for traveling as it has a case and it&#x27;s small. Regular razors are much larger, as you can see from the comparison picture above, and they have no case. Not really a good item to bring with you especially when you are trying to bring with you lots of toiletries and beauty products on a trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I DO NOT LIKE ABOUT IT:&lt;br /&gt; 1. NOT A MAJOR NECESSITY. I do like the idea of on-the-go razors, but shaving is something I religiously do at home in the shower. I have never felt the need to shave while I was out and about. It&#x27;s a nice product to have, but it is something I will buy only if I am going to a travel. Since I do not travel often (last time I traveled was two years ago), I do not find it necessary to own this. Like I said, it is very good for travelers, but not for me.</li>
    <li> This razor is great for on the go because it has small packaging and comes in a small carrying case. This razor gets a really close shave but definitely requires shaving cream, so that makes the travel a little less easy. Overall, it&#x27;s a good razor but I think I would stick with my Schick intuition razor for at home purposes, though the snap razor does offer a closer shave</li>
    <li> i received this razor from influenster, and It&#x27;s just like any other razor, its just smaller. it didnt really impress me because i needed shaving cream to use it because it wouldnt lather or anything when i wet it. it also didnt shave very well.</li>
    <li> I chose a 3 star because it&#x27;s an ok razor. Not my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is outrageous in my opinion. I don&#x27;t want to pay $10 for razor that comes with one blade. I think personally the price should be reduced tremendously. It is compact and is great for travel if you have little space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say I would recommend to anyone honesty.</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Influenster for the purposes of testing it and reviewing the product for Venus-Gillette. I got it in the mail just in time for a weekend get-away with my boyfriend. I really liked that the razor itself was so compact and that it had a case to store it in, which was very convenient for travel. As for the performance of the razor itself-it isn&#x27;t ideal for a full shave. The short handle makes it difficult to maneuver on the backs of the legs and despite it being a 5-blade razor, it didn&#x27;t give me as close of a shave as I&#x27;d prefer. The design of the razor and the carrying case would make it perfect to carry in your purse or your gym bag to have for touch-ups or on-the-go  shaving for those days when you forget(we all do it!). The small handle was great for maneuvering around my bikini line though, I must add.</li>
    <li> Gives a great close shave and leaves your legs so smooth. Great for on the go, small and easy to take anywhere!</li>
    <li> Influenster sent this to me to review. I absolutely love the portability of this razor. Perfect for fashionistas on the go.</li>
    <li> I received the Venus Snap Embrace as my very first VoxBox from Influester and I loved it!! Its small enough to fit in any purse or cosmetic bag and its perfect for on any of your needs when your in a hurry. I would not recommend using it for regular use or when you need to shave large areas but it is great for those little touch ups! The carrying case that it comes with also great for travel and allows any excess moisture to escape and prevent any mold or mildew from developing.</li>
    <li> This razor is perfect for people with an on-the-go lifestyle! It&#x27;s small and very easy to pack! Definitely useful for a college student!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually buy pricy razors - only store brand - because well, I&#x27;m cheap. I jumped at the chance to try this one out. It&#x27;s a little awkward to hold if you are used to a long handle, but seemed to have just as good a shave! I forgot how much nicer a Gillette shave is opposed to a store brand. :) Definitely encouraged me to go back to buying the pricier razors for a better shave!</li>
    <li> I received this razor from Influenster, free of charge. But, I would absolutely buy this in a heart beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect for someone like me who is always on the go. Between three jobs, school and living between mine and my boyfriends house this little razor is perfect for me! I can easily keep it in my purse or overnight bag and it stays safe in it&#x27;s little plastic cover. I also think this grip is better than the one on all of the full-sized razors, but maybe that&#x27;s just because I have tiny hands. :) I would HIGHLY recommend everyone go out and get this adorable razor!</li>
    <li> I think the whole idea is pretty great. Its perfect to take with you to the beach, on vacation, camping, pretty much anywhere. You could even keep it in your makeup bag right in your purse if you wanted to. The Embrace razor head makes it easy to touch up literally anywhere, just wet the razor and youre good to go, no shaving cream needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely look forward to taking this little guy on vacations, beach trips, and little getaways with me this summer.</li>
    <li> This is a great compact razor great for in the car or in your beach bag! Its great for when you notice one lonely little hair you missed! Shaves close and leaves skin feeling smooth!</li>
    <li> Its compact, fits in any purse or handbag and leaves you with silky smooth legs. And it come with a traveling case</li>
    <li> This little razor is perfect for on-the-go or traveling! It&#x27;s small, has the Gillette razor I love, and comes with a cute little case that has holes for drainage. It keeps my legs smooth and fits anywhere I want to keep it, I couldn&#x27;t ask for more from a razor. The handle does seem odd at first but it fits perfectly in my hand so I don&#x27;t mind! I got sent this product free to try from Influenster in order to test it out, and I am glad I did! Definitely give it a try if you haven&#x27;t yet.</li>
    <li> I received In a snap razor to review for Influenster. I received it for testing purposes and am a non paid tester. I really like the idea or it. It works really well with just water. For what it is I am thinking it should either be sold for cheaper or sold with refill cartridges. It comes with a convenient carry case. The razor is also interchangeable with any cartridge from venus. Over all a very good product</li>
    <li> I think the razor itself works amazing. I just didn&#x27;t care for how small the handle was. I understand it&#x27;s an on the go razor though and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not really complaining because it&#x27;s supposed to be compact and small. Like I said works great and I would probably use it again if I were going on vacation :)</li>
    <li> I really loved this razor. It was so small that I was able to put it in my suitcase with no problem! It did not take up any room and all, &amp; the best thing was I did not have to shave my legs as often!</li>
    <li> So I got this product in a #VoxBox from #influenster. It was meant for me to try it and see if I like it, Well I love it but that isn&#x27;t even the issue. My husband liked it so much he took it with him and never returned it. He works for Comcast looking good is a big part of his job. I never before used a Venus product and they have gained two customers at my house not to mention I have 5 daughters. What I love most about this product is its size and ease of use. I have a daughter with a short arm and 7 fingures makes it really hard to manipulate many things but this is something that she even found easy. She doesn&#x27;t have thumbs and its wide base makes it easy to clip between her fingers. Great Product!!!</li>
    <li> I think this product is amazing. It not only leaves my legs nice and smooth but it&#x27;s so perfect for taking on trips. It&#x27;s compacted nice and small where I can fit this product in my purse and even though it&#x27;s small, it has perfect grips that allow it not to slip out of my hands. Would def recommend this product for traveling.</li>
    <li> I recently used this razor for my bikini area before a day on the lake. It was easy to use with out having to use shaving gel or being in the shower. It left my bikini line smooth and razor burn free!</li>
    <li> I got this product complimentary from influenster for testing purposes. I really like it for traveling because of the case. The case also has holes in the bottom so that if it gets wet it easily drys out. It is also nice because if you throw it in your purse you don&#x27;t have to worry about accidentally cutting yourself.</li>
    <li> As a female you are genetically programed to like compacts. or maybe not but well I do I think it&#x27;s my love of makeup that makes me love everything in a compact.&lt;br /&gt;The fact that this comes in one makes it super portable. I always lose the little clear plastic protector on my razors and when i try to store it i can easily get cut so I love this. The Venus embrace head that it comes with is really nice also. I usually get the cheapy no brand razors and I end up with dry legs that i have to use some body butter on to dehydrate my legs. The Venus line has always been my go to for expensive razors when I can splurge so I really like this it gave me a really smooth shave my legs felt super soft and nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;Nice razor head 5 blades.&lt;br /&gt;Comes in compact.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to store.&lt;br /&gt;Great for lazy shavers like myself because you can put it in your purse or makeup bag.&lt;br /&gt;Good grip on the handle. Easy to control, and avoid nicking yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;haven&#x27;t found any.</li>
    <li> Love this little razor. It&#x27;s easy to pack and small enough to fit in small places. Smooth legs don&#x27;t hurt either!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Gillette Venus Snap with Embrace! I am overjoyed that it is so small, yet so effective. All i have to have is running water! I have 3 kids and there has been a time or two that ive found myself forgetting spots. No more! Love this product.</li>
    <li> I tried this Venus snap razor after years of dealing with razor burn from my Schick razors. It&#x27;s the perfect size and glides so easily onto the skin. It&#x27;s awesome!!! Definitely worth a try. It also comes in a cute little blue, plastic case for traveling.</li>
    <li> This is a great little razor for on the go or travel. It may be small but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I received this razor, complimentary from influenster, for review purposes. I love the built in moisturizers so I don&#x27;t need shaving cream. The head is a bit bulky tho. I would probably only recommend it for legs and underarms.</li>
    <li> I love the shape and size of this razor! The clam-like shape makes it super easy to travel with and it&#x27;s pretty cute. It&#x27;s also easy to maneuver and holds in your hand nicely. I cannot say enough positive things about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like the actual Venus Embrace Razor. I&#x27;ve used this in the past and I find it way too bulky. To me it seems as if it was over designed. While the shave you get is smooth, it dulls fast and I just don&#x27;t like it. Overall, the product is would be fine if you&#x27;re only planning to use it for travel.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It has a close shave and left my skin feeling extremely smooth. It is also portable in case you miss a spot in the shower which I love. It left a lot of irritation which wouldn&#x27;t be good if I used this in public. Luckily I was at home and the irritation went away in about 15 minutes. It&#x27;s not their fault that I have sensitive skin so I am keeping my rating at 5 stars. Would definitely buy a new razor head for sensitive skin but other than that I love this product.</li>
    <li> I received this in the mail and so far I use it every time that I am on the go (which is a lot). I am a mother and a college student so this makes shaving easier.</li>
    <li> There are so many things I love about this little razor. What I like the most that it is compatible with many Venus line refills, not just the Embrace line. I also do like that it comes with a case that isn&#x27;t bulky and doesn&#x27;t take up too much room in a makeup bag, a purse, a drawer, a gym bag or even a locker. The travel friendliness is one of the best features yet. The shave is just as good with a regular sized razor handle. I hope to see other companies follow suit with this idea as well.</li>
    <li> Pretty good, nice as expected</li>
    <li> I recived this razor from Influenster for testing.The Venus Snap with Embrace was the perfect match for me because I’m a busy college student who also works part-time. I usually am so stressed that I only have time to shave when I take a shower and even then I have to rush a little or don’t feel like having to go over the same spot more than once to get a clean shave. The Venus Snap with Embrace has changed my whole shaving experience, now I don’t have to worry about going over my legs more than once or checking to see if the razor missed any spots. This razor gets the job done quickly and in a “snap” as the name says. Just add water wherever you are and the Venus Snap will get every hair without you having to worry. Not to mention it’s very smooth and goes with the shape of your legs.</li>
    <li> I received this razor though influencer to test it out. I love it. It gives a really close shave so my skin feels super smooth. I love that it&#x27;s small yet has enough grip so that it doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hand while shaving. And I I love the case it comes in. It fits perfectly in my carry-on.</li>
    <li> I got this product to try from Influenster to test it out to see my opinions on it and I can honestly say I love this product! All you need to do is put the razor under water and it does the job nicely. My skin is very sensitive and it caused no irritation or redness. The size of the product is so perfect for travel and for other occasions in which you need a quick shave very quickly. I am in love with this product and i will be buying it again. I also like that once the blades have dulled you can replace them with any replacement razor head and it will still be travel friendly. Overall this is a great product.</li>
    <li> This cute little razor is great for travel. It&#x27;s small, compact and has a case that covers it all - so if it&#x27;s not completely dried off when you have to leave the hotel, no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t use it on a daily basis (I like longer handles for that), but for travel, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I love the Gillette Venus Snap with Embrace Women&#x27;s Razor! It&#x27;s so cute and small. It fits my purse and i can take it with me everywhere! And I got this razor from Influenster as a test product . I will recommend it to everybody. #InASnap #VoxBox #Influenster # GilletteVenusSnap</li>
    <li> Using this razor on the go is perfect. I&#x27;ve been bringing it with me on trips home, to visit my boyfriend and to visit sorority sisters! It&#x27;s the perfect size to slip into my travel bag, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about a wet razor when I have to leave right away. I would recommend this for any college student on the go!</li>
    <li> For the longest time I was always using a men&#x27;s razor. Women told me that that&#x27;s the way to go! WRONG. Gillette Venus razors are my go to now, and I love them. They leave my skin feeling soft and smooth, and they don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something to carry with you on travels, this is a great product to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star reduction only because the price is a bit iffy, but Gillette is generally offering good coupons too.</li>
    <li> First Impression: As soon as I opened my door to the very decorative Gillette Venus box I was excited! I ripped the box open and found a tiny blue container. \\&quot;Hmm...\\&quot; I thought, \\&quot;Is this just a razor blade or is it the entire razor?\\&quot; This razor is so small! It took me a few minutes to realize that the handle was meant for me to use and not just to hold the razor blade (haha).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before: I thought for sure that a razor this small would be too difficult to shave my legs with. I pictured myself dropping the razor a few times or fumbling with it and cutting myself. I felt bad thinking that I was going to have to write a bad review about a product. I gave it a shot anyways though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After: Boy, was I wrong! This razor is fantastic. It is really easy to handle. There is something about the flat, rounded shape of the handle that makes it so easy to hold. I found this razor to actually be easier to handle then most other razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually find the best shaving results with men&#x27;s razors, but the Gillette Venus With Snap Embrace is my new favorite razor. The five blades give you a close, clean shave without razor burn or cuts. Other then the perfect compact size, what really sets this razor apart from others is water activated gel ribbon all the way around the razor blades. You don&#x27;t need to use shaving cream because the gel around the blades moisturizes your skin as you shave. I absolutely love the blue carrying case it comes in too. It is great to protect your razor from germs and from moisture melting the gel ribbon. I love this razor and I will be purchasing these from now on! I highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product FREE from Influenster.com. However, the complimentary aspect of this does not reflect my honest opinions noted in this review.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It&#x27;s small and compact, which is great for traveling. I also love that you don&#x27;t have to purchase more razors. Instead like many of the Gillette products all you have to do is repurchase the razor blades and with a click it&#x27;s easy to replace.</li>
    <li> I love it!!! The sleek carrying case makes it perfect for on the go! Very good razor. I would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> I got this from Influenster to test out and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised.  We all have those days where we miss a spot and realize it halfway through the day, so to have something small and easy-to-carry with me to fix those spots is a great idea.  The blade itself has (what Venus calls) a water activated Ribbon of Moisture which kept my sensitive skin from having any irritation, which was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d use as my everyday shower razor, as the handle isn&#x27;t up to a full-on shaving task, but it&#x27;s great to toss in my bag to carry with me as a way to manage missed spots (especially with summer coming and shorts, skirts and bathing suits becoming a regular).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the blade is incredible, so I could easily see buying a regular handle for shower use and then letting my replacement blades do double-duty between the two handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I have is that it is a little hard to clean after using &amp;#34;out and about&amp;#34; and I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s the only negative (and why I didn&#x27;t give two stars).  It&#x27;s hard to get all the little hairs out of the blades and &amp;#34;ribbon of moisture&amp;#34; when not using it in the shower.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I received it as a freebie from influenster.com. The packaging is super cute and handy. You can toss it in your purse, your beach bag, overnight-bag or luggage. Not only is it super nifty it works great! I&#x27;m new to using Gillette Venus razors, and I&#x27;m now a fan of them. When I used it my skin was super soft, smooth, and I did not have any razor bumps. I will definitely be purchasing this again and definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect razor for traveling. It doesnt take up a lot of space in my travel bag and its very easy to hold! I recommend this for anyone who needs something that is easy to pack.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so tiny and convenient that it fits right in my purse without taking up much space. The razor itself is amazing! Shaved my legs not too long ago, and they are still smooth. Does not jag, when you shave. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I received this to review from Infleuenster. I was un sure about the control I would have with the short little handle, at first. But it worked out, and I didn&#x27;t cut my self like I was afraid I would. The little case is handy to keep razor goop off of the rest of your toiletries while traveling. I gave it 4 stars because of the price of the blades, they aren&#x27;t any cheaper than other Venus razors.</li>
    <li> This razor is small, has a travel case and is perfect for all of my traveling needs. I feel that I could even put this in my purse or in my car for any emergency needs that I may have. I was really relieved and surprised by how much I loved the cartridge and the five blade layout. I would recommend this razor to anyone that travels a lot or prefers a small, on the go razor.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this razor to review. Overall, I liked the performance and functionality of the razor and would consider continuing to use the razor when on-the-go. PROS - Compact size for traveling or transport, though the carrying case makes the overall product take up space that is comparable to other disposable-head razors; Swivel head contours very well to curves of leg muscles versus stationary-head razors;</li>
    <li> I recently received the Gillette Venus Snap razor from Influenster and I have to say it is amazing and so handy. The case makes it perfect to just throw it in a bag and not have it thrown around and getting dirty from other stuff you might have in your bag. It is great and so convenient. I rarely take trips but i believe that this would be great for on the go. I have to admit it does such a close shave and it left my legs feeling so smooth. I loved it! It is great for people that love to travel.</li>
    <li> The Gillette® Venus® Snap with Embrace is an awesome razor for traveling because it is so small and portable. You can literally drop this in your purse and go! It leaves a very smooth surface wherever your shaving and you can hardly see any bumps left behind. The only thing is that the container does get a little foggy, so make sure to wipe it down after each use.</li>
    <li> New favorite razor! Love how easy it glides and for me with small hands the shorter handle was perfect! Comes in it&#x27;s own case easy to pack and travel with or put away from little ones!</li>
    <li> This little guy is perfect to take on vacation! I&#x27;m probably not the only one but I&#x27;m always in a rush to finish packing so I generally miss a few spots here and there while shaving for vacation. Thankfully, with this little guy it was a &amp;#34;snap&amp;#34; to touch up some spots I may have forgotten.</li>
    <li> I got this razor free from Influesnter. So I cant say much about the price. I think it may be on the steep end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this fun little razor comes in a round, little carrying case and has its own soap/lotion- perfect for a vacation razor. It eliminates the need to carry shaving cream and normal size razors. The case keeps you and your stuff away from the blades and the water away from your stuff. All pluses if you ask me. The shave is also nice and close, which kind of surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the cons, I only have two thus far. One, the short handle is more difficult for maneuvering. However, the point of this razor is for on the go, so you have to give up one or the other. Secondly, cleaning was a bit of a challenge. It has a full size razor head, so I&#x27;m not really sure as to why this is. perhaps because I didn&#x27;t shave during my shower but on the go instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I would say it does everything it promises. Its a perfect on the go, beauty companion!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing surprising about this razor, either good or bad.  This razor uses the same blade as the standard Venus, so if you like the performance of the standard razor, you&#x27;ll be pleased with this.  The small handle is easier to maneuver than I expected, and I like that the case has holes on the bottom to allow the blade to dry.</li>
    <li> Great razor for on the go. It is perfect for traveling and light weight. I love this razor and will definitely repurchase. I received this razor complimentary from influenster to review but all opinions stated are my own.</li>
    <li> I feel like the concept behind this razor makes a good marketing point but overall design in my opinion was a swing and a miss. It is difficult to hold onto when using it and could lead to some pretty serious accidental cuts because of this.</li>
    <li> I recieved this razor in my voxbox from Influenster and I love it. It is very tiny (I measured it next to one of my lipsticks and it was the same lenght, it fits perfectly in my purse for on the go, and it comes in a cute little case. This razor has been perfect for small spots that I realize I have missed after shaving when I am out of the house. I just find some water and shave. I wouldn&#x27;t use this for a full leg shave, since I would rather shave at home with shaving cream ans water, but it is perfect for what it&#x27;s made for, on the go.</li>
    <li> I love this razor its great for on the go or if you&#x27;re in a hurry, This is a must have during summer when you&#x27;re going to the pool or beach or whatever. It left my skin feeling smooth and soft. I am defiantly going to be buying another one soon!</li>
    <li> I tried this for the first time today and it has the 5 blades on it and it worked great. It is very small, small enough to hold onto, yet still easy to shave with. I recommend!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this razor. It&#x27;s so easy to use and leaves my skin so soft. It&#x27;s super convenient which is great for busy people. I suggest it&#x27;s a must have for all girls.</li>
    <li> I received the Gillette Venus Snap razor complimentary from Influenster.com for review purposes and it is awesome! It&#x27;s very compact and easy to take with you or use at home. It gives an incredibly smooth and close shave too!</li>
    <li> I received this razor complimentary from influenster for testing purposes. I love the compact size and travel case!! I always buy razors with 3+ blades so these 5 blades are right upy alley and provide an extremely close shave! Best part- it&#x27;s not bulky so I can easily throw it in my purse or overnight bag.</li>
    <li> AND I LOVE IT. I normally only buy bic disposable razors for any and all purposes, but I tried this out and I will forever shell out the money for a venus from here on out. The razor works so smoothly that I didn&#x27;t even have to use lotion after I shaved my legs, it was brilliant. The product comes in this little plastic carrying case for easy travel, and this will definitely be going with me when the comic conventions open up this summer.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product, I&#x27;m hooked for life.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect to care for this product a whole lot, but I was so wrong! I love it! Great to keep in the car for touch-ups when you find a spot you missed! Very compact and comes with a great carrying case. Same great quality as the regular size! Love it!</li>
    <li> I Love this works great on the go!  Perfect for women who travel alot or to put in gym bag.</li>
    <li> This was so cute, and works just like the the regular Venus!  Tiny with a cool carrying case so I can keep it  in my purse of makeup bag.</li>
    <li> For testing purposes, I received the Gillette Venus Snap with Embrace Women&#x27;s Razor from Influenster. The razor is easy to carry, easy to use, and it makes shaving so simple! Especially when you accidentally miss a spot! I love this razor!</li>
    <li> I recently received a free sample of this razor. This razor is small, so it works well to throw in your bag and bring it to the gym, travel, or just simply on the go. I like the 5 blades for a nice close smooth shave. The travel case that is comes with is nice as well. I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone that is on the go a lot.</li>
    <li> I got this from influenster so i got it for free and i have to admit i would pay full price for it. Its easy to use and of course easy to travel with. I love the little holes in the case so it can breathe.</li>
    <li> Loved this product it got a very close shave and even fits into my smallest purse discreetly. Overall really efficient packaging too.</li>
    <li> I received this‬ razor from Influenster and I was so excited to try it out as Ive previous used Venus products and been really happy. At first look I thought the idea and design were fabulous for travel. I gave it a shot and was super disappointed :( Once I started shaving I found the size/shape of the handle awkward to hold and the razor was terrible on my sensitive skin. I only ended up using it on the bottom half of my legs. Because of my skin I expect the first use of a new razor to be a bit uncomfortable but this was just terrible. I really, really hope Im in the minority with my experience!!</li>
    <li> I loved this razor! It gave me a silky smooth feeling without having to put in much effort. Not only is it powerful but it is portable. It comes in the cutest blue case that looks like an oyster and has holes at the bottom to help it dry. This razor is so small that it can easily fit in a clutch, gym bag, or purse. I received this razor complimentary from Influenster.</li>
    <li> I had never actually used any Gillette product before I got this product free to test. But, I immediately fell in love with it! With five razors and a flexible head, you never have to worry about missing a spot or nicking your skin! It works perfectly on the first swipe and every one after that! I will definitely be buying more refills for this handy little guy!</li>
    <li> Love this razor! Its perfect for summer and traveling! It actually has a great shave with 5 blades and super moisturizing. Great size and love the case in comes in. Amazing! I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> The price is a little steep, but this is a great item. I received one from Influenster for testing and I love it. It&#x27;s a great size for travel and even has its own carrying case!</li>
    <li> I chose a four star rating because overall its a really good shave. It has the signature  5 blades and piveting head, I like that you do not need any shave gel or soap to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I will it lasted longer though or at least came with a refill.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I received it complementary from Influenster for testing purposes and it is perfect for on-the-go. The two things that I love most about it are that it comes in a case and that it uses the same razor heads as all of their other razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I love the case because you don&#x27;t have to worry about keeping up with those disposable little plastic things that keep your blades from cutting you when you throw them in your suitcase. The case is made of a hard plastic so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it breaking. With the case, you also don&#x27;t have to worry about the blade scratching your clothes or you when you reach your hand in your suitcase to pull stuff out. It is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I love that the blade heads are the same as all of their other razors because that means that you don&#x27;t have to worry about buying a refill just for your travel razor. Most people would say that they would rather just buy a disposable razor or take their normal razor on-the-go. But after using this, you will love it. Especially if you are going on a trip for one or two days, why would you waste a whole razor on that short amount of time. With this one, you can use it over and over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this razor a few weeks ago and I used it this past weekend while I was a bridesmaid in a wedding. It was perfect for this occasion and I plan to take it with me to the beach a lot this summer. Everyone will be hollering at my silky smooth legs...</li>
    <li> I recently received a Gillette Venus In A Snap razor for complimentary testing purposes from Influenster.com, and really like its small size and functionality. It provides a pretty close shave, but I feel like it doesn&#x27;t last very long and have to shave again sooner than normal.</li>
    <li> I got this product for testing purposes from Influenster. It came with a cute little case so you can easily travel with it! The case actually has little holes in it, so the water can escape after you put the razor in it. The razor itself is a little small, and a little hard to hold, but it does have a grip at the end of it, maybe my hands are just large! :) I will be using this when I got to the pool/beach for a quick shave if needed!  Overall, this is the perfect on the go razor!</li>
    <li> Its ok just very small</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because it still provides all the great benefits of the Venus razors, but the handle is a little tricky to hold into because it is small.  But, with all that said, it&#x27;s a good product.  And if you travel a lot and don&#x27;t want to take your full sized razors, this will work just fine.  Also, thank you Influenster, for the sample of this product!</li>
    <li> I really like this razor. Its perfect for travel, just throw in your purse and go! It doesn&#x27;t leave razor burn like cheap razors do. Only downside is the price!</li>
    <li> This is great for road trips, when packing space really counts and you don&#x27;t have room for a bigger razor and shaving cream (there are moisture-activated ribbons on the razor head). I used it after I&#x27;d been driving and camping for a while and then wanted to go out for a nice evening one night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem, as others have mentioned, is that the handle does make it difficult for maneuvering at times.</li>
    <li> I used this Venus Snap Razor on a recent trip and it worked perfectly. I love the case that it comes in, especially since I&#x27;m always afraid the razor I used to keep in my toiletries bag would slice my finger whenever I would reach in for my mascara or shampoo. I have small hands so the handle worked perfectly for me, but I could see how others with larger hands would get annoyed with the small handle.</li>
    <li> Such a compact and easy razor to pack for trips and etc. I like to pack it for touch ups when I&#x27;m out and about in the sun.</li>
    <li> This small razor is every busy girl&#x27;s secret to quick smooth underarms and legs. It&#x27;s shape and size help you quickly shave. The case it comes in is great for travelling. It can be used without shaving cream..but I still use soap/cream/anything conditioning..otherwise it gives you that tight/dry feeling. I definitely would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I got this razor free from Influesnter. Considering the price I wouldn&#x27;t normally choose this item I think it may be on the steep end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It fits perfectly in my overnight bag and even my purse. Looks really cute and surprisingly fits all replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It gave me razor burn when using it with just water like it says you can. Lesson learned.... very irritatingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end its great to take on trips/traveling but dont use it just water like it says it can be used.</li>
    <li> AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!  This super cute purple mini razor does the trick! It comes in a convenient little box that fits perfectly into your favorite clutch for many on the go emergency situations, I&#x27;m always running around and some time I just forget or don&#x27;t have the time to shave! But this has really gotten me out of some hairy mishaps lol its simply a must for EVERY WOMAN to at least try :)</li>
    <li> This shaver is great, and very cute. I absolutely love the little case it comes in! It&#x27;s so appealing to put in my purse and take anywhere!</li>
    <li> I received the Venus Snap in an Influenster box a couple weeks ago. It took me awhile to try it because I was intimidated by it&#x27;s small size, all I kept thinking was, &amp;#34;this isn&#x27;t going to end well!&amp;#34; but boy was I surprised!! This little baby packs a punch! I&#x27;m a mom of a one year old so I don&#x27;t get much &amp;#34;me&amp;#34; time but this razor was so convenient and quick it was amazing. No nicks like I thought there would be, and it was a really close and smooth shave. I&#x27;m in love with this product and definitely would buy again! it&#x27;s a must have for anyone on the go.</li>
    <li> This razor is pretty amazing. It&#x27;s small and works great for traveling or camping but it still works amazingly and gets all the hairs in the difficult places. Love this product</li>
    <li> Okay guys, I have to admit...I was really skeptical about this little bitty Gilette Venus with Embrace razor! Even my legs are super sensitive, I get razor burn allll the time but this razor is a winner! I have used it every day on my vacation in Florida, usually without shaving cream and no razor burn in sight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little pricey for one razor and the handle takes a little to get used to, which is why I gave it four stars. That being said, I got mine for free from Influenster so I was really happy with it. I will more than likely purchase refill blades so that I can use it for future impromptu trips!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect razor for the summer!! It is very small and comes with a container for storage that will fit in any beach bag or purse!! The container has vent holes in it so it dries fast and doesn&#x27;t build up mildew. I also love the moisturizing strip on there so I wont need any shaving cream while I&#x27;m on the go! All I need is some water and I get a close, smooth shave! I definitely recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was sent this product from Influenster for reviewing purposes!*</li>
    <li> The Gillette Venus Snap with Embrace has been a life saver..  Its so compact and easy to carry around when traveling and you get a nice close and smooth shave from this razor.. A deffinant must have!!1</li>
    <li> So I tried this razor to review it for Influenster, and I have to say it&#x27;s pretty decent for a portable razor. The shave is super close and smooth, and does not give me razor bumps or irritation. I thought it would be hard to handle at first, because it has such a small handle, but it was super easy. The only thing I wish this razor would have done is lasted longer. This is not a razor that will last more than a couple of days if you shave every day like me. But overall it&#x27;s a decent razor that&#x27;s worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#gotitfree #influenster #Gillette #InASnap</li>
    <li> This razor came in handy in last minute situations where I didn&#x27;t get to shave or I forgot to shave under my arms or if I missed a spot on my leg. I loved it. I received it to review for influenster and loved it so much I went out to buy another. Thanks!</li>
    <li> At first, I was hesitant about how little the razor appeared. Would I be able to hold it easily?&lt;br /&gt;It turns out, I like holding this razor compared to others! And that is not the best part. The first time I used this was on a spur of the moment &amp;#34;Oh no! I need a quick shave&amp;#34; type of deal. I put my razor under some water, and boom! I had a flawless close shave on the go.&lt;br /&gt;The moisture bars are amazing, and I was able to shave with just a dab of water (seems surreal right?). I love this little razor. It comes in a little travel case (which contains some holes to allow water to escape away from your razor, further keeping the razor in tip top shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this razor to everyone! I have found my new everyday/ travel razor.</li>
    <li> I recieved the Venus Snap with Embrace razor complimentary from Influenster. I must say I love that it has 4 blades and gets a close smooth shave and does not irritate my skin. The size of the razor and the small compact it comes in makes it easy and simple to take on the go with you. It leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth and I would recommend it to anyone especially those who travel around a lot.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.. I always carried a razor around and I would but myself going through my purse. With the Venus snap I can carry it Anywhere!!! With the convenient case it&#x27;s safe to carry around and avoid cuts in your hand! It&#x27;s totally worth the price. I recommend this product to my family and friends!</li>
    <li> I gave this a five star rating because it is by far the best Razor I&#x27;ve ever used! It gives me the closest cut I&#x27;v ever had and I don&#x27;t even need to use any shaving cream. It never misses a spot or nicks. It leaves my silky smooth. And it is so small you could fit in a clutch. I love how portable it is. I can take it anywhere. I&#x27;ll never buy another razor.</li>
    <li> I thought the Venus Snap was a great product.  Makes skin feel soft. Its small size makes it more convenient on the go.</li>
    <li> I love this product for any hairs missed whether it&#x27;s as soon as I step out of the shower or as I get ready for a night out, this is seriously an amazing product. How did a company not think of this sooner!?</li>
    <li> Its cute and easy to handle. Not for a full in shave, but works great for in the go! Very handy and portable.Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is something that comes in handy when you need a quick touch-up. Especially if you&#x27;re in a hurry for to go out. I used it a few times but my skin is so sensitive my legs seemed to have been irritated from it. It wasn&#x27;t painful, just a little itchy but didn&#x27;t last long. I still plan on using it again though, but maybe just for under my arms.</li>
    <li> I love this product, the carrying case makes for an excellent travel/togo package - keeps your stuff dry and allows the razor to dry off preventing mold from growing.  My one complaint is that the handle makes shaving slightly more difficult but it&#x27;s a small handle for the purpose of keeping it travel size so I didn&#x27;t take any stars off for that one problem.  Great for the on the go lady who likes to keep things silky smooth!</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to test this razor by Influenster and Gillette Venus. I am NOT paid to give my opinion this is free,I am simply expressing my opinion in this review on how this razor did for me. This compact razor fit perfectly in my gym back and my purse. it shaved perfectly, with its flexible head to get a close shave and leave my legs smoothly. Thank you so much for allowing me to test this for free and give my review. I recommend this product for all the ladies who you are on the go and need a close shave</li>
    <li> This is a handy little razor. Besides the cute little new packaging it works well. I like the nice smooth shave it gave, that it has a full size blade, and gives a good shave with just water. I was skeptical at first at how well it would work and how easy it would be to hold, but I was nicely surprised at the nice smooth shave I got and it was easy to get a good grip on the handle with 2 or 3 fingers. I found that it works best when I put water on my skin and rinse the blade and then shave. The water makes the blue strip around the blades soft and replaced using a shaving cream.  I like that it has a travel case with holes on the bottom so it will not keep moisture in and will dry out, even in a bag.  This makes it much easier for me to shave on a trip or before a spontaneous activity. I will recommend this to family and friends and anyone wanting an easy smooth shave on the go or on a trip or vacation.&lt;br /&gt;I got this from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Took mine on vacation and it couldn&#x27;t have been easier to keep my legs smooth. 100% recommend. Thanks influenster</li>
    <li> I love this little razor!  It&#x27;s so small and convenient and the stripping on the edges allows you to not need shaving cream if you don&#x27;t want to.  You can just throw this little baby in your overnight bag and be ready to go.  I also like that it has a small case and the case has holes in it so it dries properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have is the price.  I was lucky enough to find a coupon on Amazon to bring the price down a bit.  But all in all it&#x27;s a great little razor.</li>
    <li> Works really great on shaving. My other razors do not compare to this one. I would recommend every woman have one</li>
    <li> I travel a lot, all over the world, and this razor is a great addition to my travel kit. I used to shorten my old razors to reduce their size for travel, but this one is already small enough.  The handle is very easy to hold even when wet and the blade results in a nice smooth shave. The case is nice with holes for drainage.</li>
    <li> (For clarification, this is written by Stephen&#x27;s gf)  I LOVE this simply ingenious razor handle and case!  I have to say I haven&#x27;t tried the blade it came with yet as it&#x27;s not my type/I don&#x27;t need built in soap in the blade.  I&#x27;ve been using the same Venus handle forever in my normal shower, and it&#x27;s not easy to travel with, plus I wanted another one so I could keep it in my gym bag most of the time.  For those who think that this short handle wouldn&#x27;t be easy to use/hold onto, I think I actually hold the longer handle the same way as this tiny one anyway.  It handles perfectly - just the right amount of handle, yet entirely compact.  I especially love that I can use my own Original Venus blades with it.  Perfect for the gym and travel!  Already used it both places and it&#x27;s the best solution I have found yet.  Will be recommending this little guy to everyone!!</li>
    <li> Got this to replace full-sized Venus razor that I left in a hotel room. It is a bit awkward to hold, slippery, and feels flimsier than the full size version. I do like the carrying case, and I will keep this one for travel, but buy a full-sized one again for home.</li>
    <li> I like this, but, the case it comes with is too big to make convenient for traveling. It would be better if you just had a razor cover which comes when you buy refills but not on the first razor in case. I just put razor cover on and throw in my makeup bag when traveling.</li>
    <li> Great razor as all Venus Embrace razors are, but the handle on this design is just too small. I ended up buying another original style Venus Embrace razor right away,</li>
    <li> Nice razor - especially for travel - comes with a great little case to keep it clean and protected. Got this one for my daughter and my wife uses the older Venus razor. The older 4-blade Venus cartridges DO fit this handle which is a plus for us since we have a large package of them.</li>
