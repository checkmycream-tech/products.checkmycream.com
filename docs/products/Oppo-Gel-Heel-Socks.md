<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I live in the desert and have chronically dry, cracked heels. The great thing about these gel socks is they do not feel restrictive. I do apply a thin layer of lotion before putting them on. But I have definitely noticed an improvement in my skin. Flip flop season was a breeze! I would absolutely recommend these. They arrived on-time and as-described.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for my problem. My heels are split real bad, and they bother me a lot while using the treadmill.These socks are perfect.</li>
    <li> I had to throw out my first pair because they started looking dingy and you can&#x27;t really wash them in bleach.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a second pair and decided to dye them black, which turned them dark blue and I love them!&lt;br /&gt;I just followed the directions on the bottle of RITE Dye and made sure the water wasn&#x27;t too hot when I soaked them.</li>
    <li> During the winter, my heals turn to dust. These are much better than regular socks, as they hold in the cream/oil and keep the moisture in all night. I liked them so much, I bought a pair for my mom.</li>
    <li> Works as described. I scrub and apply the socks at night to keep them clean on the inside. Although they are one sz fits all, I wear sz 8.5W after having 3 children, and it is pretty snug in the morning. But my heels are softer to the touch and the cracked skin is healing fast.</li>
    <li> These socks are so great.  They keep the lotion right where I put it and keeps it moist and away from the sheets. When I walk on them, they are so padded at the heel.  I use them  every night.  I have 3 pair of them, so I can wash them every few nights.  They wash easily on delicate and dry fast left out in the air.</li>
    <li> I find full socks too warm to wear to bed.  These work great and last quite a while with gentle washing.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be different but they really didn&#x27;t help but they might for you</li>
    <li> I love these heel socks.  I just wish they were for the whole foot.  They make calluses disappear.  I found them through Amazon.</li>
    <li> The pair of socks I received have no gel inserts in them.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! I don&#x27;t use often but I don&#x27;t need to anymore thanks to a great product. They wash easily and stay in place on my feet.</li>
    <li> I love that this has a gel insert and is soft. It helps keep the cream on my heel and my only problem is that I don&#x27;t use it more often. Does offer some comfort!</li>
    <li> helps heels stay more suple.</li>
    <li> Product as advertised; works well.  Great for dry skin relief on heels.  Easy to wash and do what they are supposed to do.</li>
    <li> These are terrible!! They have no gel in the heels!! :(&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I ordered another kind as well and those were brilliant! THESE are trash!</li>
    <li> Got these for my 85 yr old mother. She has heel pain at night in bed and they have been perfect for her. She wears them every night. Relieves the pain well.</li>
    <li> so fa so good excellent cushion for my heal , feel lot better</li>
    <li> These are wonderful and do just what they say. I live in the desert and my feet were hurting from the dry winter air. The only problems I have with them are the following:&lt;br /&gt;1. They don&#x27;t stay put if you walk in them, or really even while sleeping. They bunch and twist so that the gel ends up on your inner ankle.&lt;br /&gt;2. Dead skin collects on the edges of the gel areas and they are hard to clean. The plus side is you know they&#x27;re taking the dead skin off when you see it.&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s annoying that they don&#x27;t cover the whole foot and only have gel over the heel. I am ordering some full booties in a different brand so that they will take care of the calluses on other parts of my feet, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite these problems, they are wonderful and do just what they say.</li>
    <li> Glad I bought them last month.  Helps cushion the back of my heel against bursitis pain and irritation (&amp; bottom foot against excess shock).&lt;br /&gt;However, a couple of my pairs of shoes do not have enough room in the heel for the extra thickness so that the increased pressure offsets the value of the decreased abrasion.&lt;br /&gt;I wish they had different thicknesses because I would prefer thicker in some shoes.  But overall, very good.</li>
    <li> These actually fit better than Earth Therapeutics and are considerably cheaper. They&#x27;re very comfortable and I wear them just about every other night.</li>
    <li> These were not as softening as another brand I tried which were unfortunately too tight on my foot (size 7). Still looking for the perfect pair.</li>
    <li> working great so far. i had thin cotton socks and was using those with moisturiser on my very dry, cracked heels (AZ weather). These make your feet very soft.</li>
    <li> i threw them away after wearing once or twice as the gel was leaking.  I didn&#x27;t launder them to cause the leak, they were just poor quality.</li>
    <li> Recommend against purchasing these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  they came in a small black plastic bag with a label stuck to it, not as pictured in a nice new box&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  they appeared to me to have been used - there weer multiple stains on them.  Gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)  They smelled of some kind of perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;too big a hassle to return them, which is perhaps what they count on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lesson learned, wont be buying from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I just got these in the mail from Amazon and wore them last night. This morning when I got up and took them off, my heels felt smooth and soft for the first time EVER.  I have very dry heels, I smooth them, moisturize, everything. And what usually happens is my heel will then crack from being so dry.  So I used to have to put band-aids on because it would hurt to walk with an open cut on my heel.    I&#x27;ve only used this product one night but I&#x27;m sold.  I ordered 2 more today for my sisters.  It&#x27;s a good price, especially when there are more expensive socks for the heels.  I thought the cool part was that the inside of the sock had this silicon gel material that kept your foot cool. It feel really neat to walk in them too.</li>
    <li> Very nice! U wake up with the softest feet. I gave it a 4 star cos the edges are a bit tight &amp; can get uncomfortable wen sleepin..</li>
    <li> I have purchased socks similar to these before at Walgreens or some other department store with a pharmacy section; however; they charge double the price! These socks have the gel right on the heels. I wear them to bed at night to help keep my dry, cracked feet nice and soft for easy exfoliation in the mornings. This is a whole lot cheaper than having to get routine pedicures! They work like a charm.</li>
    <li> These are great for dry or cracked heels.  I use these with Heeltastic and they work great.  It is so great that they are heel socks only, so my feet don&#x27;t get hot at night.  I love that they are easy to wash since they are open on both ends, unlike a footed sock.  These even got washed and dried by accident and they still survived (drier was on delicate).  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it but they amazingly survived.  If you are going to wear them during the day, I recommend putting a then sock over them and wearing sneakers since they are a bit slippery to walk in.  I think wearing them to bed is the best bet.  I would recommend this product, however it works best with Heeltastic.</li>
    <li> I needed something I could wear to bed at night and keep my scratchy heels from sticking to the covers and also not make my feet too hot like a normal pair of socks. These were perfect and also helped smooth out my heels. They definitely are not something you would wear in a pair of shoes as they have gel like heels and when you walk your heels feel like they are sliding from side to side.&lt;br /&gt;Glad I purchased them and when they wear out will definitely get another pair.</li>
    <li> Wore these last night. Heels were softer in the morning.</li>
    <li> I really like these. The fit is a little loose (I&#x27;m size 6.5), have really thick gel lining, and even come with a lotion sample that I really liked. I have had them for a couple months now and usually throw them in the washer once a week, though not the dryer. Initially I put them in the gentle cycle but now I just throw them in with everything else and they seem to be fine.</li>
    <li> Have tried everything these work great! My heels are soft when I wake and the socks are very comfortable to sleep in. No mess no worries. I have given several pair away as gifts and people love them.</li>
    <li> The heel socks really helped cushion my heels so that my feet could heal. I&#x27;m on my feet a lot and on concrete and hard surfaces. The bad part is that I dont like the smell of them.</li>
    <li> My heels were horribly calloused and I had developed a deep crack that was so painful I could barely walk.  I also had a deep callous alongside my big toe.  I was desperate for relief and I bought both the gel heel sock and the Heel Tastic.  The gel lining in the sock is supposed to be infused with its own medicine but I bought them primarily because I thought it would do a good job keeping the Heel Tastic on my callous and not rubbed off inside my sock or on the carpet. After the very first night I could see a big difference in my heel and within a week there was no trace of the crack or the callous.  The skin was soft and pink and worthy of some strappy sandals!  Alongside my toe where the sock didn&#x27;t cover, the Heel Tastic still cured it but it took a bit longer.  Initially, after they were healed up I ignored them again for a bit and the callouses started coming back with a vengeance.  I used both products again to clear it up.  Now I wear just the gel socks two nights a week and that has kept them smooth and nice.</li>
    <li> IT REALLY HELPED MY MOMS CALLUSED HEEL&lt;br /&gt;EASY TO WEAR AND VERY COMFORTABLE COLOR IS NICE TOO&lt;br /&gt;WOUL RCOMMEND IT</li>
    <li> I have previously worn (and loved) the gel socks from FootSmart, which have gel-lined toes as well as the body of the sock.  So I was surprised that these socks only have gel on the heel area, and that area is pretty small.  They do have somewhat of a compression effect, though, and that felt good on my arches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my first walk I noticed the gel on the inside of the heel area had begun to pull away.  There were parts where there was no gel left at all. I understand these might not be made for walking, but I hoped to use them to prevent blisters as the FootSmart gel socks do.  I didn&#x27;t get any blisters, but I doubt these socks will make it through the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also have a very strong scent to them.  I had to put them back in the bag when not wearing them because the smell was so overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They may be perfect for just wearing at night when you sleep, but not for my purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the fit, I wear a size 9 shoe and these did not seem tight at all, but because of the compression they did form close to my foot unlike regular socks.</li>
    <li> There work so well and so fast!!!!! By the next morning my heels are noticeably softer! Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Purchased these for my sister, who has horribly cracked heals.  She wore them for two days, and clled me and asked where she could get more-that they worked miraculously.  I promptly ordered her three more pairs.</li>
    <li> I love these heel socks.&lt;br /&gt;I can sleep in them and not have my feet get too hot.&lt;br /&gt;They work well to help relieve the cracking and dry skin on my heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these to anyone who has problems with cracking on their heels.</li>
    <li> I love these so much. I despise sleeping in socks. Sometimes I have very rough and dry heels due to eczema so these allow me to apply the medication to my heels and still feel unrestricted as I sleep :) I&#x27;ve washed them in cold water in a garment bag (and usually with dish towels or something I&#x27;m not too concerned about if it gets ruined) and they are totally fine! I don&#x27;t put them in the dryer at all but they&#x27;ve stayed put together just fine unlike some reviews.</li>
    <li> They were too tight - even in the largest size. Otherwise, I really liked the concept of&lt;br /&gt;the moisturizing around the heel. If they were bigger, would be perfect. Excellent service.</li>
    <li> They slip right off your feet if you put lotion on your heals with the socks. Tried to wear them to bed for a good over night therapy but didn&#x27;t last 5 minutes on my feet, haven&#x27;t put them on since, so I have no idea if they work or  not.</li>
    <li> works well.  Sleep in them.  Cool without the toes.</li>
    <li> I am in a wheelchair and these socks comfort my heels from the pressure!  They have made a huge difference!</li>
    <li> They work! Not only do they soften the skin they cushion any pain from skin cracks and bone spurs!!!! I am on my second pair, I will get more! Thank you.</li>
    <li> The socks are too tight and the heel protector inside the sock is peeling off.  The socks themselves are falling apart at the seams after two or three days of use, .</li>
    <li> These are wonderful for dry and cracked heels.  They work without lotion, but work even better if you rub some lotion on your heels and then wear these.  I have worn them during the day at home with my slippers and they feel almost like the gel pads you can buy!</li>
    <li> these socks do not seem to help my cracked heel. instead, i wear them while i sleep, after i&#x27;ve used an alternative crack cream. the petroleum gel seems to have no purpose.</li>
    <li> The gel socks are comfortable and moisturising for the heels at the same time. The only trick is washing it.&lt;br /&gt;May be even better if they were full length sock and in a nude/skin/dark colour versus light blue.</li>
    <li> They do sooth and cool your heels.  They are very slippery--move around under socks.  They don&#x27;t stay in place very well.  I thought they were rather expensive considering the amount of time they last.  I have probably used them 6 times and they are ready for the trash.  Can&#x27;t be cleaned without ruining the gel.  Just okay.</li>
    <li> I ordered these but when they arrived, they were in a random black plastic bag.  No box, not label, nothing.  A bit hesitant to even use then as I cannot tell the origin or anything about them.</li>
    <li> Wow, these are awesome</li>
    <li> Great for softening heels</li>
    <li> My wife loves them. She ordered another pair.</li>
    <li> It works when I remember to put them on, anyway. I have arthritis and it&#x27;s hard to cream my heels, so this helps the situation. The toes are open so you feel constricted as you might with full socks.</li>
    <li> These things really work.  I put them on when I went to bed and night.  My heels became very soft and I didn&#x27;t have that white, dried-out look to them after a couple of weeks.  They feel a little weird when you first put them on, only because of the cold \\&quot;gel\\&quot; in the heel, but in a minute they&#x27;re fine.  The selling point to me was that they don&#x27;t cover your whole foot.  I have a problem sometimes with my feet getting too hot at night, so leaving my toes exposed really helped that not to happen.</li>
    <li> Product arrived promptly and was as described. The problem is size. They were purchased for a friend with a small frame; the socks were so tight that it left a large indention in the leg. The elastic  had to be cut so the ankle would not have the circulation cut off.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry heels, probably because I seldom wear socks &amp; wear opened heeled shoes. This provides some protection from the elements &amp; helps hold in the lotion or oils you use to keep your heels moisturized. I would not buy many of these, but they are a good buy.</li>
    <li> it works particularly when your feet hurt.</li>
    <li> Works really well in keeping moisture on my foot and allow it to heal. No pun intended! My foot is in better shape now than it has been in for years.  I highly recommend it to any one!  Medications stay on the heal not in my socks!</li>
    <li> I was initially afraid that these would not fit my size 14 feet. They did fit and were actually quite comfortable and worked as described. They have eased the calluses on the back of both feet and made them easier to control.</li>
    <li> What can I add this this other then it creates moisture to that area and seems to sooth cracked heals and the plus is you can do this while you sleep.  I like to add some added foot cream and slough off the dead skin with a pumice stone, this combination make your feet feel brand new in jut three days.</li>
    <li> I purchased these to wear overnight as my heel had a crack in it. My feet are naturally dry. It&#x27;s a little bit of work to prevent cracks and/or excessive dryness in my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked these, but a little warning. Be a little careful when putting these on and removing. The gel tore in one of mine after only a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the gel tore after a couple uses, and the tight uncomfortable feeling of having a half sock on.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: did the job, retained moisture in my foot, as well as helped heal a dry crack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend them? Yes. :)</li>
    <li> I had surgery on my heel to remove cancer and these gel socks work great protecting the delicate skin (skin graft) which now covers my heel.</li>
    <li> I ordered another brand very similsr to these that were way too tight.  These are airy and so comfortable, I forget I have them on.  I will be ordering another pair so I always have a clean pair to wear!  I can walk around and not have my heels crack and bleed...and I can put lotion on the heels and it will stay there and not rub off.  My goal is to get rid of the cracked heels for good and this should do it!</li>
    <li> Great item! Works for rough heels. Socks are soft and not at all itchy or uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> These socks worked as promised . My heels are very soft without having to scrape them. After my shower, I lotion my feet &amp; put socks on for 15 or 20 mins.</li>
    <li> For decades I have had trouble with dry, cracked heels. No amount of moisturizing or filing or soaking ever helped. However, Oppo Gel Heel Socks worked in a matter of hours! My heels actually feel SOFT! I am amazed! I will be buying more of these for sure. I DO wish they had a whole foot product. I wholeheartedly recommend this product to anyone who suffers with dry, cracked, painful heels.</li>
    <li> These are pretty good.  They seem to be made of durable materials and they do, in fact, help to moisturize my feet better than any moisturizer can by itself.  My only advice to other shoppers is that these are for larger feet - they were a little to big on me and slid around too much for my comfort.  I have a ladies size 7.5.  So if you have a larger ladies foot, or a man&#x27;s foot, these might work better for you.&lt;br /&gt;And if your heels are as bad as mine were - dry, peeling, and cracked so bad they bleed and it&#x27;s hard to walk on - I highly recommend the aerosol anti-fungal sprays, followed by a very thick moisturizer such as Avon Footworks or Burt&#x27;s Bees Coconut foot cream. Within three days of using these socks plus those two products, a ton of dead flaky skin came off, my cracks were really starting to heal up and there was no more pain.</li>
    <li> Great product, especially if your feet get hot at night.  I got two pair so I can wear one and launder the other.</li>
    <li> I got these for my wife who has had cracked and calloused heels for many years. These really did help heal them up (she used together with Heel Tastic heel therapy ointment). She has used them extensively for about 3 weeks and the gel is already starting to rub off. One of the biggest pains is that the socks must be handwashed. If I buy more of these, I would probably purchase at least 2 pairs so they can be alternated while washed.</li>
    <li> Very good.  I sleep in these every night and often wear them with my slippers.  This and the pedi egg together have made the callouses depart.  Yeah</li>
    <li> I have several pairs of these heel socks.  I love them.  My heels get very dry and cracked, especially now that I moved to Arizona and wear flip flops all the time. I just rub some cream on my heels, put on the socks and climb into bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They DON&#x27;T make my feet hot like wearing the whole foot gel sock, or everyday socks.  These heel socks are perfect.  Your feet will be very soft, usually in 2 or 3 nights of wearing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash them in the washing machine and let them air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed with these heel socks.  You will love them!</li>
    <li> I loved the socks but I only got to wear 3 times and the gel on the inside started coming off. I paid $17.00 with the shipping. They are great for 3 wearings.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these.  Who would have thought something so small could make such a difference.  After having extreme foot pain for months, I bought everything I thought might help.  These were one of the best products.  Could wear them without shoes, which was nice as who wants to put on shoes the moment one gets up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I wore these non stop for at least a month.&lt;br /&gt;My pain is gone!&lt;br /&gt;I still pull them out if I am going to be on my feet all day or if I am just feeling weary.  Puts a bounce in my step.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn them several nights.  They feel good, but I&#x27;ve not seen a bit of difference in my heels.  Would stick with the lotion; skip the socks</li>
    <li> the gel heal socks are perfect. They fit right and make my feet very soft. Glad I bought the gel socks.</li>
    <li> A LITTLE TIGHT PRODUCT QUALITY OK AND GLAD I TRIED THEM AND HAND WASH AND JUST LET DRY ON RACK</li>
    <li> These are very comfy and soft. I have been wearing them to bed for a few weeks and my feet feel so refresher in the morning.They don&#x27;t leave any sock lines and my heels are smooth and ready for sandals everyday without needing to pumice!</li>
    <li> Suffered with cracking heals for a long time.  This product helps to keep things moist and allows things to heal.  Comfortable and great for night time.</li>
    <li> I have pretty badly cracked heels and this greatly speeds the softening and healing. It also thin and airy so I can hardly tell its on my foot.</li>
    <li> I have trouble with my heels- they hurt if I am standing for too long or barefoot on tile or hardwood for a long time so I thought these would help with cushioning.  They don&#x27;t really give too much cushion but the cool gel is a nice feeling on my heels.  If I lotion up first and then wear them, they seem to help with the heel cracks.  So basically they&#x27;re okay- nothing great.</li>
    <li> They most certainly do the job of ridding the dryness of the heel, but don&#x27;t wear them all the time, outside of being a little tough to get on, they work as advertised, would order again !!</li>
    <li> These gel heel socks are doing exactly what I bought them to do. They are fine quality and very comfortable. Priced right, too.</li>
    <li> My heels were so cracked and dried that I limped with pain. I tried many remedies but none were easy to use and didn&#x27;t last long. When these gel heel socks arrived, I immediately put them on and over night my skin had improved dramatically and the healing process had started. Within a couple days of wearing the socks my heels were 90% better and healed completely shortly after. These socks are the best solution i have found yet and I highly recommend them if anyone has dry cracked heels.</li>
    <li> They are comfortable and easy to put on.  I bought these for my husband as he has very rough heels and quickly wears through our sheets.  He gets hot easily and these don&#x27;t keep his feet warm during the night.  They do have a tendency to wear through faster than I thought but this might just be because of his rough heels.</li>
    <li> These arrived on time and well packaged. They worked as promised. I have just a few things to mention:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They slip around a bit, and the gel is only on the heel cup part. I think that they are best worn to bed. I think if you wore a sock over it maybe wouldn&#x27;t slip as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were very comfortable and non binding even on my size 10 feet and ankles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used them twice a week with Glysolid balm which is the best cracked/dry skin cream (trust me I&#x27;m a healthcare professional and former stylist) But I also used an anti-fungal stick balm (heeltastic) the rest of the nights with plain socks. You should use anti fungal balm if you use this product because it works by using body heat moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use these you will NEED to exfoliate the morning after! Because they retain so much moisture on the skin surface, your heels will need a good pumice when you take them off after an all-nighter. The best Pumice that I use exclusively is called \\&quot;feet first buffing pad\\&quot;. Don&#x27;t forget to use a good lotion after the pumice to close up the skin...and be careful with fragrances, they can encourage fungus. I like glysolid balm or some kind of citrus lotion.</li>
    <li> No more blisters.  Sock is comfortable and doesn&#x27;t take up too much room in your shoe.</li>
    <li> They Frey quick, but work well.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended I purchase these to help with a sore foot.  (Not my heel). They were somewhat constricting, and to this day I am not sure how to wash them and maintain the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; like substance.  But...my foot is completely healed so it must have worked.</li>
    <li> Item received matching thank you and Astlentha without delay and were matched as advertised Thank you for your services good high-end</li>
    <li> These are great.  I bought them originally for my husband who has diabetes and foot issues.&lt;br /&gt;He didn&#x27;t care for them for whatever reasons so I tried them on my dry winter heels and loved&lt;br /&gt;the softening effect on the skin and the general comfort when walking with them on.</li>
    <li> This item is very comfortable. Great for my sore ankle, but also softened my heels. Nice to walk on. Washable. I ordered another pair.</li>
    <li> Help well for my cracked heels</li>
    <li> These are great.  Even after just 3 days of wearing them most of the time, I could tell a big difference in the softness of my heels.  I highly recommend them.  I was skeptical but no reason to be.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got hoofs for heels. These, with a bit of Aquaphor makes them better! They take care of preventing/healing those painful cracks. Hooray for Oppo Gel Heel Socks!</li>
    <li> I live in hot, dry Arizona and these socks made a dramatic improvement on my cracked and painful heels.  After only three uses, however, the socks started disintegrating.  I only wear them at night when sleeping and the fabric is nevertheless shredding and the gel is pulling away from the fabric.  The company that makes them may have a quality control problem or perhaps I got a knock-off as I know sometimes happens on Amazon.  At the same time I bought these socks I also ordered the Visco socks, which, while they don’t seem to moisturize quite as well, at least hold together.</li>
    <li> The construction is horrible, it has broken already.</li>
    <li> Justo lo que quería, se sienten suaves en los pies, y el paquete viene sellado y puede verse claramente que son nuevas!!! para las personas con dolores en los talones alivía bastante.</li>
    <li> This worked for me to soften my heel so they weren&#x27;t so dry and elimated the skin from peeling.  It did seem that the gel started to wear down right away but that is understandable from walking.</li>
    <li> I tore my Achilles in a car accident. It&#x27;s been 5 months since the operation. Tearing my Achilles has been even more painful then bi-lateral knee replacements this gel sock not only comforts where the doctor operated but soothes and comforts the area where he operated. This had caused me the most pain until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for the Achilles Tendernitis, heal pain even heal bone spurs</li>
    <li> Purchased these to help cushion the back part of my heel where I developed bursitis last winter. I was hoping to wear shoes with a back this year to avoid the snow-in-shoes problem I had to deal with last year and thought these might do the trick. Unfortunately, after only wearing them twice, I found the silicone cracking in several places. I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;ll only last another wear or two. They may work well for nighttime use only, but definitely can&#x27;t hold up to being worn with shoes. The quality of the sock itself was good. As far as sizing, I&#x27;m a size 6 and a smaller person in general. They fit perfectly, so I can see how they&#x27;d be too snug for some.</li>
    <li> After two days of use, outer blue layer completely fell apart. Gel area was decent size for good amount of coverage. Don&#x27;t buy if you plan on walking around in them. More suitable for sleeping only.</li>
    <li> I am a 44 year old male. Size 11 shoe, medium width. I walk about six times a week, and I get blisters on the back of my feet where my heel bone is. I slide these on so that most of the gel is against the back of my foot. I have been using these for about a week now, and they are working great!</li>
    <li> Better then others. Great gel support for heel bump and allows me to wear regular shoes. Will purchase again</li>
    <li> Socks are OK, but only last about 2 weeks and then they start to fall apart - little pieces of gel fall out. For the price, I don&#x27;t think they are worth it.</li>
    <li> this sock comes with no gel insert</li>
    <li> I have really dry heels and boy do these work great!!!  I use them every night when I go to bed!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I could not tell any difference in my heels before using these socks than after using the socks. I was disappointed</li>
    <li> okay for heels but my whole foot needs the gel.</li>
    <li> They just fit a size 12 mens normal width foot, just</li>
    <li> first felt good but it is sweaty, slide and wanted to take off by some sort of stress. Why aren&#x27;t any socks makes gel sandwiched between fabrics that way you still feel cotton but moisturized meanwhile.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find them fantastic, but they were ok.</li>
    <li> It will cure your heels after few days wear it on. It is comfortable when you wear it and not make you feel hot in your feet.</li>
    <li> These really do make your heels soft after one night!!  I will buy more.  I am still looking for plain socks without the gel.</li>
    <li> I love these. I put my foot cream on at night and then glide these babies over my heels and I&#x27;m good to go for the night. They&#x27;re comfortable and hold the cream in place, as well as adding moisture from the gel they have in them. You can even wash them, on gentle, in a lingerie bag, when they get grubby from too much cream.  My feet have never felt so good.</li>
    <li> This is the first summer that I have not had cracked heels!  Between sandals and garden dirt my heels are generally a mess during the summer. This year it is a different story.  I still smooth them off with a rasps every shower I take, but at night I put lotion on them and then put these socks on.  The socks are like a mini sauna for your heel. They have a jell heal that holds the lotion in and keeps the heal moist all night long. In the morning my heels are as soft as the rest of my skin.  The socks are fairly comfortable to wear but occasionally (with swelling on my part) the elastic is tight around my foot. I actually stretch these socks around a fat water glass and let it sit until the elastic eases up.  These socks have become a mainstay in my battle against painful cracked heals. Would not go without them!</li>
    <li> Bought 2 pair for myself and husband.  Really works great.  Wear it at night and sometimes under socks and tennis shoes. Also washes well on gentle cycle</li>
    <li> This is my second pair and I love them . Makes a big difference.</li>
    <li> My diabetic husband has a lot of wounds on the back of his heel from restless leg syndrome.  The gel inside these socks didn&#x27;t last through the first washing, but I still found them useful because I have to keep his feet bandaged to prevent additional abrasions, and these stretchy socks help hold the bandage in place.  Otherwise, he rubs the bandages off and tears up his heels rubbing them while he sleeps.  We have several pair and just cycle through them every time I change his bandages.</li>
    <li> My heels were in such terrible shape, deeply cracked, that I wore these for about a week, all day.  At the end of that time, the gel lining in the socks was shredded, but my heels were healed.  I will buy another pair, in case my heels get that bad again, but I will wear them only at night.</li>
    <li> About what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure these will ever get used.&lt;br /&gt;Probably wasted the money.&lt;br /&gt;Oh well live and learn.</li>
