    <li> Love this stuff! I love all the soap and glory things I&#x27;ve gotten- some of the smells aren&#x27;t my favorite but they all work. This is one that I love the smell of and how soft it makes my little feet! Definitely will be a new regular item in my house.</li>
    <li> This is by far the BEST cream for your feet.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of others and have been disappointed in them. But the Soap and Glory Foot Cream is SUPERIOR. I&#x27;ve bought it several times. A tube lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many types of lotions for rough skin on my heel and bottom of feet. Nothing has worked as well as this. I apply it after a shower and put socks on to secure it. Doing this for a week or two shows clear results.</li>
    <li> it is amazing to use this cream which can moisture your heels and soft never before. and you can use it on your elbow also</li>

    <li> I got the product very quickly and I used it according to instructions.  It does work very well and I will probably be getting it again. Also, the marketing on the product was witty and I liked that the bottle is pink.</li>
    <li> THE BEST foot cream.  Put it on at night, put on a thin cotton sock and the next morning, it&#x27;s like you have brand new feet.  So soft.  I use it more in the winter, because, let&#x27;s be honest, who&#x27;s feet look or feel good in the winter?!  LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
    <li> This is would be a perfect product, however it has a very strong odor.  I read the other reviews about the smell and purchased it anyway.  I like the product and want to use it more often.  My heels are getting better the more I use it. But I just wish they could improve the strong odor. At the very least, they could change the smell to something more pleasing.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed. It was just slightly better than a regular cream. I was expecting a thicker cream. After using it for 3 weeks, I haven&#x27;t noticed a HUGE difference.</li>
    <li> I simply adore this product !!! I like to use it on my feet and my hands as well , it is very good for both !!</li>

    <li> The most awesome foot cream.</li>
    <li> I have tried many foot creams and have liked a lot of them .I love the pevonia foot cream but there is not enough of it for the price and I like to use enough product to soak in and really moisturize or put on two lighter layers .I have usedlalot of products that don&#x27;t seem to last.I put them on after showering before bed while my feet are a little damp to lock in the moisture and I wake up and my feet feel dry and tight .They are staying soft and feeling smooth much longer with this product and there is enough in a tube to last me a couple of monthes .( I use it a lot).I would definitely repurchase this product.</li>

    <li> Makes my really rough feet soft.  Still need to scrape but definitely keeps them from cracking. The body butter is my favorite</li>
    <li> For as long as I can remember, my heels have always been rough, dry and crack easily.  I have spent a lot of money on creams, body butters, skin buffers, etc, to help make my feet look presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product and it really is working wonders.  My feet literally soak it up.  The smell is pleasant, with just a bit of an odd odor.  (However, the hand cream smells amazing.)  It doesn&#x27;t leave my feet feeling greasy either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every night after a shower, I put some on, throw some socks on and it starts to work it&#x27;s magic.  I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Miracle cream. Slather on at night, put on socks, and wake up to soft feet! I could never be without this.</li>
    <li> Amazing. This stuff really works. Haven&#x27;t used my Emjoi in weeks and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to any time soon.</li>
    <li> I have never experienced such a fast &#x27;recovery&#x27; of my very dry feet.  It was fantastic.  My feet are still soft and I do not have to use it every night.</li>

    <li> I like it, but it is a tad bit greasy. Not sure if that is the way its suppose to be, but sometimes it seems to linger even after washing my hands. Its good - but use in small doses!</li>
    <li> For me this is a winter must have, can not live without it!</li>
    <li> This product works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> It is ok, but I was hoping for better results...the tube is on the small side. Bottom line, not worth the money !</li>
    <li> Soap glory for feet is an excellent product for your feet.  IF YOUR looking for soft nonsticky cream for dry skin on your feet.  You should try this soap glory.  I will look for other soap glory creams for myself.</li>
    <li> NOT AT ALL WHAT I READ IN THE REVIEWS! I assumed since everyone raved about the heel genius that it had to be great and worth the price which is very overpriced for a simple cream. SAVE YOUR MONEY!! I think this product is more catered to people with naturally soft soles and just enhances that</li>
    <li> This is all I will buy for my feet. I found it a couple of years ago and it is now not sold in my area, so I use Amazon to find it for me. It&#x27;s worth any extra cost to order it. Between the work it does and the wonderful smell......I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> Totally disappointing. It doesn&#x27;t do what it says on the tin.</li>
    <li> Soap and Glory is such a fun brand and their products are really effective as well. I was so sad when Target stop selling this brand however I was really excited with Amazon started to sell it. Its worth every penny. I loved it so much I bought the whole line.  My husband broke his leg and I used this product on his feet untill the cast ccame off and he loved it.</li>
    <li> I loved it so much I bought the whole line.&lt;br /&gt;This product smells very good&lt;br /&gt;i Love this product so much</li>
    <li> Want to really feel like a girl? Buy Soap and Glory! Discovered all their products in the UK and happy that I can buy many products in Canada. Heel genius is great after a hot foot scrub - then lather with heel genius - wrap your feet in socks and voila...soft, feminine feet, once again.</li>
