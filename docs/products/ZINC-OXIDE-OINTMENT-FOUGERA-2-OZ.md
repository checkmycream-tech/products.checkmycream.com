      <li>&quot; whenever we put it on, and she&#x27;s fine about it.      </li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly.  </li>
      <li>This stuff went on a lot easier and was light tan colored, but then turned whitish when rubbed into the skin.</li>
      <li>I tried the baby preparations but they smelled and/or felt too light on the skin.  </li>

      <li>I was kind of surprised, because with all the good reviews about zinc oxide, I expected it to be some miracle product.</li>
      <li>Im sure it was fine, bought it for my grandson, didn&#x27;t use personally.</li>
      <li>When my daughter&#x27;s doctor finally said that she wasn&#x27;t able do anything more and referred us to a dermatologist, I was really concerned.</li>
      <li>So this is great and keeps my LO&#x27;s skin clear of red from eczema and sun!</li>
      <li>Just plain old fashion zinc oxide that makes the BEST underarm deodorant!</li>
      <li>I put it on and right away I noticed an improvement.</li>
      <li>The sample was this exact brand.</li>
      <li>This is my first zinc oxide ointment purchase.</li>
      <li>Okay, first of all, I am not giving medical advice.</li>
      <li>A pea size bit in each pit after a shower will last for many days.</li>
      <li>It can be rubbed in and covered with makeup pretty well too.</li>
      <li>finally I was able to find something that helped.</li>
      <li>Its fine, not as easy to apply as some brands, a bit thicker - less a cream than a paste.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also great for all the other skin irritations zinc oxide has been used for traditionally.</li>
      <li>This basic formulation is very adequate for her.</li>
      <li>Regular zinc oxide had been around a long time and is an exceptional moisture barrier for skin irritations and does not have the &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; smell.</li>
      <li>She really fancies it and sometimes it helps her knees not getting hurts at night.</li>
      <li>I grew up with zinc oxide as a remedy for scrapes and scratches and owies and still find it very helpful in aiding the healing process.  </li>
      <li>This is the real thing.</li>
      <li>Zinc is a very underrated element.  </li>
      <li>It heals extremely fast and is not greasy at all.  </li>
      <li>Again it did absolutely nothing for itches at all or rashes on skin from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Not really what I was looking for but it works more for&lt;</li>
      <li>The price is a bit higher than I was used to paying locally but still worth it.  </li>
      <li>This particular zinc oxide is a tan color so in matches with your skin.</li>
      <li>, I was told many different things, diaper rash, contact dermatitis, and finally a diagnosis of psoriasis.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
      <li>The next day I put it on again and just about felt like I wouldn&#x27;t need it anymore, it worked that fast!!</li>
      <li>It was like applying nothing as far as what it did to help my skin rashes, or the itching, it was absolutely worthless.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>i have used zinc oxide all my life and i am 60 years old!</li>
      <li>I first purchased this in Florida and couldn&#x27;t find it locally.  </li>
      <li>Hard to find in stores but an invaluable ointment to have around the house for all kinds of skin related issues, zinc oxide has amazing healing powers.</li>
      <li>Baby&#x27;s bottoms have been protected from rashes for generations by this stuff, way before modern childhood diseases (autism, cancer, you name it) got so prevalent, so it&#x27;s got to be safer than the commercial offerings.</li>
      <li>I am JUST SAYING that when my husband&#x27;s rosacea flares up, especially when he&#x27;s been exposed to too much sun, applying this ointment dramatically reduces the redness and bumps on his face within about an hour.</li>
      <li>I bought a tube of the white zinc oxide at Rite Aid, it was white and pasty-like, kind of like toothpaste only a little thicker.</li>
      <li>I was very happy to read about the reviewer who shared their difficult experience with a diaper rash, visiting the doctor multiple times and finally being referred to a dermatologist, because I was about to schedule an appointment with a dermatologist for a skin irritation I had been fighting for 2 months and treated every other way I knew how to no avail.</li>
      <li>and the next day they were almost completely healed.  </li>
      <li>this is the only brand of Zinc Oxide I have found that meet the doctor&#x27;s prescription for no other additives, such as Lanolin</li>

<li> I ordered this and received in about 10 days (too long for something I needed this badly -</li>
<li> You can apply it thickly or thinly and doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
<li> So its not perfect, but its zinc oxide.</li>
<li> Zinc Oxide is difficult to find in Pharmacies</li>
<li> but now that I have cleared up the worst of the problem I will use other products for the itch.</li>
<li> I used it on my hands which were chaffed from the cold weather and put gloves on overnight</li>
<li> You will not be disappointed.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I use this as my only deodorant. A pea size bit in each pit after a shower will last for many days. It isn&#x27;t scented like baby powder or smell of fish like many others do. Just plain old fashion zinc oxide that makes the BEST underarm deodorant! A tube lasts more than a year for me. No harsh chemicals, no scents, no concerns about health issues, zinc in this low dose is good for you! Baby&#x27;s bottoms have been protected from rashes for generations by this stuff, way before modern childhood diseases (autism, cancer, you name it) got so prevalent, so it&#x27;s got to be safer than the commercial offerings. Once you try it, you&#x27;ll never go back!</li>
    <li> Love this, we keep it on hand for all kinds of skin irritations.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always kept zinc oxide on hand for many uses, mostly itching and skin rashes. Its sort of a staple in my medicine chest. But lately I can&#x27;t find it in the drug stores, so I got the Fougera thru amazon. Its fine, not as easy to apply as some brands, a bit thicker - less a cream than a paste. And I don&#x27;t like the tube. Its that metal - tends to break before you&#x27;ve finished with the product. So its not perfect, but its zinc oxide.</li>
    <li> We are still using it, with much left in the tube.</li>
    <li> i have used zinc oxide all my life and i am 60 years old! about three years ago, NO ONE sold it anymore! then when i did find it, it had cod liver oil in it just like baby diaper rash ointment!  i was so very excited to find the tried and true mineral oil zinc oxide!  thank you and it works just like always.</li>
    <li> As advertised, on time</li>
    <li> My dad brought this to the hospital after my daughter was born and I had noticed some redness on her (the hospital won&#x27;t do anything for that when they&#x27;re newborns).  We didn&#x27;t actually use it until much later.  We had been using Desitin, but whenever she had a rash, and she would scream in pain when we put it on.  So I started using the Fougera zinc oxide from my dad instead, and she never screamed.  In fact, we call it the \\&quot;good cream\\&quot; whenever we put it on, and she&#x27;s fine about it.      We are almost out of it, since she went through a spell of having diarrhea often, so I looked for it where my dad said he bought it, and I couldn&#x27;t find it.  If Amazon is the only place to get it, then that will have to do.</li>
    <li> This is about impossible to find in a local store even in a big city.  I grew up with zinc oxide as a remedy for scrapes and scratches and owies and still find it very helpful in aiding the healing process.  The price is a bit higher than I was used to paying locally but still worth it.  I use it on the side of my nose where my glasses rub.  Also good as a base before putting on make-up for skin-sensitive people.</li>
    <li> 2 of my sons get diaper rash very easily no matter how often I change their diapers. When a severe diaper rash comes along, this product is the BEST solution!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our pediatrician prescribed this to us. When we moved, our pharmacy didn&#x27;t carry it nor did the local drug store. I used other products that carried zince oxide in them like Desitin, but none worked like this item with a sever diaper rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is a miracle worker!</li>
    <li> For what we needed it for it was great! The skin irritation were gone in a few days. Would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Helps to stunt cold sores when applied at the first feeling or sign of one</li>
    <li> This is my first zinc oxide ointment purchase. I do trust fougera company. A lot of hospitals use its A&amp;D ointment for newborns to prevent diaper rash. It works like magic. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> The ointment is a great all purpose cream - especially for protecting and soothing the skin for my wounds care needs.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that took care of my perioral dermatitis! Since I am nursing I could not take antibiotics. Leaves face a bit white which is no problem over night. It can be rubbed in and covered with makeup pretty well too.</li>
    <li> Used it to dry up an open wound on my leg. Helped the healing process like my doc said it would. Thanks.</li>
    <li> this works wonders.  I will never be without this again.</li>
    <li> I almost immediately threw this away. Would not buy if I were you. THe purpose I bought it for was a sham.......waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought a tube of the white zinc oxide at Rite Aid, it was white and pasty-like, kind of like toothpaste only a little thicker. I suffer from sun poisoning and itchy skin on the back of my neck and upper chest a little. I applied this stuff and it went on thick and white, and no matter how much you rub it, it leaves the skin white looking. It was like applying nothing as far as what it did to help my skin rashes, or the itching, it was absolutely worthless.&lt;br /&gt;I then went to CVS and bought a zinc oxide &#x27;ointment&#x27;. This stuff went on a lot easier and was light tan colored, but then turned whitish when rubbed into the skin. Again it did absolutely nothing for itches at all or rashes on skin from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;I find that the best stuff for itches, or rashes etc seems to be hydrocortisone creams, but it&#x27;s only a temporarily fix, as sun exposure brings the itches and rash back. I was kind of surprised, because with all the good reviews about zinc oxide, I expected it to be some miracle product.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I removed a wart on the side of my big toe and it kept coming back a few days after it was removed. I read that 20% zinc oxide could keep a removed wart from returning. It worked for me. I put this cream on the hollowed out wart crater before bed, and after showering in the morning for a week. It turned the inside of the crater brown like a scab, which indicated it had killed the root of the wart. Great product. It&#x27;s been more than a week and no sign of the wart returning.</li>
    <li> This Zinc Oxide works great for healing wounds, drawing out infections and slivers, and for the best sunblock. This particular zinc oxide is a tan color so in matches with your skin. I don&#x27;t see this too often so maybe that might be the best selling point for some of you out there. I would highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> My grandma uses this product everynight. She really fancies it and sometimes it helps her knees not getting hurts at night.</li>
    <li> This is the real thing. This seller goes out of his way to make sure you are satisfied. I will definitely seek out this seller again when I am looking for this and/or similar household hygienic products.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this in Florida and couldn&#x27;t find it locally.  I tried the baby preparations but they smelled and/or felt too light on the skin.  The Fougera ointment is nice.  It goes on smoothly.  You can apply it thickly or thinly and doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
    <li> Try It.  It works for all types of skin conditions. It&#x27;s less than $10. BUY IT. You will not be disappointed.  Better than expensive prescription garbage creams. Thank you Amazon!!! (And this co!!!)</li>
    <li> This product seems to have disappeared off store shelves.  I can only find it locally in the form of a diaper rash product which has various ingredients includiing perfume.  Regular zinc oxide had been around a long time and is an exceptional moisture barrier for skin irritations and does not have the &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; smell.</li>
    <li> My wife has various alergic issues. Most Zinc Oxide ointments have different additives in the cream base and those produce alergic reactions to her. This basic formulation is very adequate for her.</li>
    <li> Hard to find in stores but an invaluable ointment to have around the house for all kinds of skin related issues, zinc oxide has amazing healing powers.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find locally anywhere.  Great product, great quality!</li>
    <li> Zinc Oxide is difficult to find in Pharmacies so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  It used to be very easy to find, but for whatever reason, is not as popular today.  I LOVE Zinc for cuts, burns, chaffing, diaper rash, etc.  It heals extremely fast and is not greasy at all.  Your skin tends to absorb it and water proofs the wound as well.  Use it for anything you would use Neosporin or Bacitracin on.  It will work much better! Zinc is a very underrated element.  I used it on my hands which were chaffed from the cold weather and put gloves on overnight and the next day they were almost completely healed.  I swear by this ointment and believe that it should be part of everyone&#x27;s medicine cabinet.  Great and trusted brand too!</li>
    <li> this is the only brand of Zinc Oxide I have found that meet the doctor&#x27;s prescription for no other additives, such as Lanolin</li>
    <li> My one year old battled a rash in her diaper area for the past 8 weeks. Numerous trips to her doctor, I was told many different things, diaper rash, contact dermatitis, and finally a diagnosis of psoriasis. We tried EVERYTHING, and I mean EVERYTHING. I tried every single diaper rash creme sold in target, walmart, cvs, and walgreens. Nothing helped. When my daughter&#x27;s doctor finally said that she wasn&#x27;t able do anything more and referred us to a dermatologist, I was really concerned. The dermatologist at the Children&#x27;s Hospital told us to use a plain Zinc Oxcide creme on her, and gave us a sample. The sample was this exact brand. I put it on her that night, and then the next day, and with in two days, her red irritated skin had begun clearing up. After 8 weeks of this stubborn rash- finally I was able to find something that helped. Thank goodness!</li>
    <li> Okay, first of all, I am not giving medical advice. I am JUST SAYING that when my husband&#x27;s rosacea flares up, especially when he&#x27;s been exposed to too much sun, applying this ointment dramatically reduces the redness and bumps on his face within about an hour. It&#x27;s also great for all the other skin irritations zinc oxide has been used for traditionally. For example, when he remembers to put it on BEFORE he&#x27;s exposed to the sun, he doesn&#x27;t react to the sun.</li>
    <li> Zinc works great for me in healing any minor cuts and irritations that I have.  Since I do not use it as a \\&quot;sun screen\\&quot; I do not need it in fancy colors or with fragrance added.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a face cream for healing and ran into this on my search. Not really what I was looking for but it works more for&lt;br /&gt;rashes. Besides that everything was good with the sales.</li>
    <li> Im sure it was fine, bought it for my grandson, didn&#x27;t use personally.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to read about the reviewer who shared their difficult experience with a diaper rash, visiting the doctor multiple times and finally being referred to a dermatologist, because I was about to schedule an appointment with a dermatologist for a skin irritation I had been fighting for 2 months and treated every other way I knew how to no avail. I ordered this and received in about 10 days (too long for something I needed this badly - I had been hoping for the sooner end of the shipping range!). I put it on and right away I noticed an improvement. The next day I put it on again and just about felt like I wouldn&#x27;t need it anymore, it worked that fast!! The only trouble for ME, was that I seem to have a sensitivity to white petroleum (aka Vaseline) and this has it in it. So I am rather itchy when I put it on but now that I have cleared up the worst of the problem I will use other products for the itch. THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> This has been hard to find. My LO has eczema and cannot have fragrance, which every other brand found in drug stores have. So this is great and keeps my LO&#x27;s skin clear of red from eczema and sun!</li>
