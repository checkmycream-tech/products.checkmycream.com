      <li>Fast process time and great color plus great gray coverage have made this my go to.  </li>
      <li>Just what the working woman, who colors her own hair needs.  </li>
      <li>And the directions are very easy to follow.</li>
      <li>However as far as the color, it is the best I&#x27;e found for what I want in hair color.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon for carrying a hard to find product, color is great but the best part is the included conditioner which is the best conditioner i have ever used.</li>
      <li>This is a gorgeous shade of rich brown.</li>
      <li>I really liked the comb top to the bottle, as it made it easier to make sure the dye was distributed evenly through my hair.</li>
      <li>If you want great hair color, great coverage of grey, and don&#x27;t have hours to do it...</li>
      <li>but this is one of the better pricing places</li>
      <li>worked in 10 minutes, better than others in 40 minutes</li>
      <li>What more could you want from a hair color?</li>
      <li>I love this product for its ease of use.  </li>
      <li>Now my hair color looks more even and better than ever.  </li>
      <li>but I am still on a quest for my favorite color.</li>
      <li>No longer available in stored-perfect shade!</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s one of the best boxed colors I have used.</li>
      <li>and i am always pleased with the color.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product, and I will use it again next month.</li>
      <li>my mother and I used this product many times, and we both began noticing significantly more hair lost, even weeks after coloring.</li>
      <li>conditioner working with it is great, and actually leaves your hair smooth and fairly undamaged, from what I can see.</li>
      <li>I used Perfect 10 a few years ago when it first came out and recalled having good results, so I purchased again on a whim because I didn&#x27;t want to pay a fortune at the salon for almost-black hair</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>so Amazon makes it so easy to get what I want when I want it.</li>
      <li>I did not find the smell to be even close to as strong as a lot of the hair color products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>So easy and quick!  </li>
      <li>The color is gorgeous and natural!</li>
      <li>That being said, it is easy to apply, and the color is rich.  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t worth it to me to fight the seller on this, but if you&#x27;re thinking about ordering the 2-pack, you may want to contact the seller prior to purchase and make sure you&#x27;re getting what you think you are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the color is great.</li>
      <li>My hair is baby soft and feels very healthy.</li>
      <li>The color is a very nice brunette, and it lasts as long as anything else out there.</li>
      <li>I am 49 years old and this brand does an outstanding job!</li>
      <li>I would not leave it in the full 10 minutes if you don&#x27;t want to be on the darker side.</li>
      <li>After using the enclosed conditioner and completing my final rinse, I combed my hair out and got a good look at the color.</li>
      <li>As someone that llikes consistant color and ease of application, and 100% coverage, I like this Perfect 10 better than all the other products I&#x27;ve used over the last years.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>My greys are completely covered, my hair looks color looks rich and natural, and I&#x27;m a happy camper.  </li>
      <li>I by good fortune after much searching found a great, quality hair color that covers 90% grey without fade out and amazingly it left my hair softer than what I started with.... that would be Redken Color fusion.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Revlon hair dye with good results for a long time</li>
      <li>This is a shockingly good product, I even felt it was worth paying more than I usually would for hair dye.    </li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>Take care to apply only to new growth, and this is a great product for dark/medium brunettes.  </li>
      <li>The color is staying fresh, with no fading.</li>
      <li>My hair feels and looks so soft and healthy after application.</li>
      <li>Start with fresh hair with no hairspray or product &amp;#34;build-up&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I thought this wouldn&#x27;t work for the price, but it actually worked in 10 minutes, my hair turned out nice and glossy</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quick, easy, and my hair felt silky soft.  </li>
      <li>I stopped going to the salon for my brown because they could never get it right.  </li>
      <li>I sometimes get the dark brown in the Loreal and it is lighter than this with better coverage (and more ease of application although a longer wait) than this.  </li>
      <li>, I piled it all on the top (it always stays wherever I put it when it&#x27;s full of dye) and called my sister in California to make her amuse me and tell me when ten minutes were up.    </li>
      <li>Besides the time factor, I actually find that I like the results better than other products I&#x27;ve used before, including nice and easy, garnier, and loreal preference.  </li>
      <li>Next time, I think I will try Light Brown since I know it will not be too light.</li>
      <li>Great lasting coloe in a short time.</li>
      <li>The greys went from white to light light brown.</li>
      <li>They give you the good gloves (not the crappy filmy thin ones most hair dyes attach to the directions)</li>
      <li>I will go back to the L&#x27;Oreal since it does address my needs much better.</li>
      <li>I love the conditioner that is included and wish I could buy it individually.</li>
      <li>LOVE THE IDEA OF HAVING ON HAIR FOR ONLY 10 MINUTES.....</li>
      <li>I used Amazon&#x27;s subscription program to buy it, so we&#x27;ll see how long THEY will be able to get it.</li>
      <li>Usually I have my stylist do it when he gives me a cut and just go with whatever he suggest because he&#x27;s a genius (Stephen at Amy and Aimee in Buffalo, NY - good luck getting an appointment!), but as my parenthetical aside suggests, if I have one of those sudden days</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>I have stubborn greys at my temples, and nowhere else really.</li>
      <li>I have used other box colors that I feel are a better representation of &amp;#34;medium brown,&amp;#34;  but that is in the eye of the beholder, I suppose.  </li>
      <li>and I swear there is more gray than I have ever seen with any other hair dye too.  </li>
      <li>The best part is it only takes 10 minutes, although, due to my stubborn greys I leave it on a little longer.</li>
      <li>and I especially like that it really only takes 10 minutes, unlike most color systems that seem to take 45+ minutes to color to their full potential.</li>
      <li>Many compliments on my &amp;#34;darker color&amp;#34; though this is the same color I last dyed with, if that is an indication</li>
      <li>If your looking for a rich warm dark colour that looks almost dark brown than this is for you!</li>
      <li>But most of all,,, it dried the bejeebers out of my hair.  </li>
      <li>I use a medium brown, and my roots are normally about 1/4 gray between colorings.</li>
      <li>The color covered most of my grey, but not total coverage as advertised.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is the best hair color product to cover the gray hair for up to 3 weeks. When I could no longer find it in the store,  I ordered it on line saving $2.00 per box! I am 49 years old and this brand does an outstanding job! For best results, I wash my hair in the morning or the night before. Then I dye it in the morning or that evening. Start with fresh hair with no hairspray or product &amp;#34;build-up&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I was really attracted to the idea that it would only take 10 minutes for this color to work.  I usually use the Loreal Mousse that takes 30 minutes.  I got the 2 pack and now I am not sure what to do with the second one since my experience with the first was so bad.  It is hard to apply.  I have been using hair color for several years - this is the first hair color ever that I called my husband into the bathroom and asked him for help because I was afraid it would take too long to apply because it was so difficult.  The squeeze bottle is tough to keep squeezing, the dye really leaves marks on your skin if you miss, and the final result was very flat and dark.  I feel like my hair is inky black with no shine or texture.  Definitely not worth any time savings.  I sometimes get the dark brown in the Loreal and it is lighter than this with better coverage (and more ease of application although a longer wait) than this.  It has been a week since I put it on and I swear there is more gray than I have ever seen with any other hair dye too.  I don&#x27;t know if that was a bad bottle - but I am definitely not using the other one.</li>
    <li> Best hair colour in my books! If your looking for a rich warm dark colour that looks almost dark brown than this is for you! Love it!!</li>
    <li> So happy you have this. I have been going crazy trying to find this product . It takes 10 minutes to dye your hair and it does the less damage to my hair then any other dye . Awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for over 25 years and have never had a reaction like this. This product Clairol Perfect 10 gave me a terrible burn on the side of my head. It&#x27;s itchy and scaley and VERY painful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a seriously fashion or cosmetics conscious person, but I hate my natural hair color (that hideous shade between brown and blond) so I always color my hair. Usually I have my stylist do it when he gives me a cut and just go with whatever he suggest because he&#x27;s a genius (Stephen at Amy and Aimee in Buffalo, NY - good luck getting an appointment!), but as my parenthetical aside suggests, if I have one of those sudden days when I can&#x27;t stand my hair, I can&#x27;t always get an emergency appointment. I&#x27;ve used Revlon hair dye with good results for a long time but when I was at the drug store today I saw that this took ten minutes and figured \\&quot;what the heck.\\&quot; Never mind the fact that I had a newly purchased container of brownish red Revlon in my bathroom that I hadn&#x27;t gotten around to using. This new thing takes ten minutes!    So tonight I dyed my hair. They give you the good gloves (not the crappy filmy thin ones most hair dyes attach to the directions) And the directions are very easy to follow. I really liked the comb top to the bottle, as it made it easier to make sure the dye was distributed evenly through my hair. So it took about five minutes to coat my hair, I piled it all on the top (it always stays wherever I put it when it&#x27;s full of dye) and called my sister in California to make her amuse me and tell me when ten minutes were up.    When it was over I rinsed it out. I was really dubious because my hair felt coarse to me and it was hard to get the tangles out while I was rinsing. When the water ran clear I immediately grabbed the included conditioner and applied it. You leave the conditioner in for two minutes, which I did, running my fingers through it to get the tangles out. After I rinsed it, I immediately threw it up in a towel, checked my email and then went back to blow dry.    I was completely shocked. I never actually believed there was a hair product that makes your hair look like the model on the box, but I swear to christ this one does. My hair looks stronger, healthier, shinier and of course, a different color. The color even looks like the example. This is a shockingly good product, I even felt it was worth paying more than I usually would for hair dye.    If you can have Stephen dye your hair, that&#x27;s the best way to get it done. If you can&#x27;t - go buy this.</li>
    <li> I color my hair every 6 weeks or so, and the most annoying thing for me is waiting for 35-45 minutes for the color to set before rinsing my head, so I thought I&#x27;d give this 10 minute dye a try. I did not find the smell to be even close to as strong as a lot of the hair color products I&#x27;ve tried. Also, although I have a sensitive scalp, there were no problems whatsoever with the way my head and hair reacted to the dye. I also noticed while washing the dye out, that it did not stain my shower, as some of the other dyes do. After using the enclosed conditioner and completing my final rinse, I combed my hair out and got a good look at the color. I use a medium brown, and my roots are normally about 1/4 gray between colorings. This hair color completely covered the gray. It has now been a couple of weeks since I colored my hair with Perfect 10. The color is staying fresh, with no fading. My hair is baby soft and feels very healthy. I&#x27;m very happy with this product, and I will use it again next month.</li>
    <li> Only 10 minutes and you hair is colored.  I really like this product.</li>
    <li> I love this color!  i always use perfect 10, it is less harsh than other dyes and i am always pleased with the color.</li>
    <li> Perfect10 covers thoroughly and in only 10 minutes. My hair looks and feels healthier after coloring. What more could you want from a hair color? I don&#x27;t use anything else! I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This color is very dark the first week or so after coloring.  I have been coloring my hair for 10 years now, and I am familiar with the initial darker color that fades as it washes to the true color, but this seems to be a bit darker than typical.  That being said, it is easy to apply, and the color is rich.  I do like the cream conditioner, which will keep hair feeling silky if used once or twice weekly. I have used other box colors that I feel are a better representation of &amp;#34;medium brown,&amp;#34;  but that is in the eye of the beholder, I suppose.  Many compliments on my &amp;#34;darker color&amp;#34; though this is the same color I last dyed with, if that is an indication how much darker it is initially. I do use shampoo for color-treated hair to help reduce fade, as well.</li>
    <li> Great lasting coloe in a short time. Easy to use. Comes with  an applicator, 2 tops fot it 1 tradiitional single spout or 1comb one.  Both work. It comes with condtioner and I use it as advised and what is left as needed.&lt;br /&gt;I like the color and it covers my white hair. No I dont have grey I have smattering of white lol.&lt;br /&gt;It last well but take into acount I dont use hairspray. It fades color and My naturally curly hair would dry out too much.&lt;br /&gt;A bit pricy but this is one of the better pricing places</li>
    <li> I have a lot of natural highlight in my hair. This is a gorgeous shade of rich brown. My hair feels and looks so soft and healthy after application. I love the conditioner that is included and wish I could buy it individually.</li>
    <li> Great product. Color lasts and covers gray.</li>
    <li> I love this product for its ease of use.  This color is as close as I can get to a Medium Chocolate Brown that I used to use but can no longer find.  I</li>
    <li> I had been using L&#x27;Oreal Paris Excellence Creme Hair Color, but tried this. A mistake. The grey coverage does not even compare to L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s. I have stubborn greys at my temples, and nowhere else really. They are in a cluster, not streaks, so I really need a hair color that colors the greys the same color as the rest of the hair. L&#x27;Oreal does this (although it does require leaving the color on the greys for the first 20 minutes, then applying color to the rest of your hair for another 20 minutes, giving the greys a total of 40 minutes!). Following the &amp;#34;only 10 minutes needed, even for greys&amp;#34; on this Clairol product, I ended up with blonde-ish patches where the greys are and my normal brown everywhere else. The greys went from white to light light brown. I would be happy if we were talking about grey streaks turning into blonde highlights, but I have two patches that make it obvious I was covering up grey temples! Not a great look for me!! I will go back to the L&#x27;Oreal since it does address my needs much better.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair color for my husband it covers great and it only stays on for 10 minutes he loves it.</li>
    <li> My favorite thing, by far, about this product is that it only takes ten minutes.  I am a busy mom and I just don&#x27;t have time to stand around with color in my hair for 40 minutes. The application takes my about 3 or 4 minutes, wait for 10 minutes, shower and I&#x27;m done.  Besides the time factor, I actually find that I like the results better than other products I&#x27;ve used before, including nice and easy, garnier, and loreal preference.  After using this for about a year, my hair was getting too dark on the ends.  Now I only apply it my roots and don&#x27;t work it into the rest of my hair, even at the end of the developing time.  You might think this roots-only approach would produce a striped effect on my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t at all. Now my hair color looks more even and better than ever.  My greys are completely covered, my hair looks color looks rich and natural, and I&#x27;m a happy camper.  I&#x27;m a very frugal shopper, and this product is absolutely worth a couple a extra dollars compared to other brands.</li>
    <li> I thought this wouldn&#x27;t work for the price, but it actually worked in 10 minutes, my hair turned out nice and glossy</li>
    <li> The color is gorgeous and natural! A Medium Brown that shines in the sun but isn&#x27;t distracting or unprofessional indoors. I have literally gotten compliments on my hair color from people at the salon, job, and school. And they tell me they&#x27;re jealous that I &amp;#34;naturally&amp;#34; have this wonderful hair color.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner working with it is great, and actually leaves your hair smooth and fairly undamaged, from what I can see.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to anyone who has to color their hair themselves.  I&#x27;ve used it for several years but cannot find it in local stores anymore!&lt;br /&gt;I hope I can always get it on amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Covers everything I want it to in a very short amount of time.  Just what the working woman, who colors her own hair needs.  They also have a great range of colors.</li>
    <li> Repeat buyer.  Great price and excellent product.  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Lots of pigment in this hair color. The medium brown was a lot darker than expected. I would not leave it in the full 10 minutes if you don&#x27;t want to be on the darker side. The color covered most of my grey, but not total coverage as advertised. Overall, it&#x27;s one of the best boxed colors I have used.</li>
    <li> Thanks Amazon for carrying a hard to find product, color is great but the best part is the included conditioner which is the best conditioner i have ever used.</li>
    <li> Provides great dimension, and doesn&#x27;t seem harmful to hair for a home product.  Fast process time and great color plus great gray coverage have made this my go to.  Stopped spending a fortune on salon color every three weeks when roots were bad, and now do it myself with great results.  Take care to apply only to new growth, and this is a great product for dark/medium brunettes.  Amazon&#x27;s subscription order simplifies my life - no longer have to run around looking for this product and hoping my color isn&#x27;t out of stock at Target or Ulta!</li>
    <li> This dye should be illegal! It gave me hives all over my body and my face has been peeling for 5 weeks now with very dry patches on my forehead and around my nose.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only hair color that works on my gray hair, and the shine it gives my hair is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Clairol</li>
    <li> Never try any other brand, 10 minutes and your done!</li>
    <li> The Medium Brown is truly perfect.  I stopped going to the salon for my brown because they could never get it right.  I was walking out with a shade that was too close to black for my taste.  I used Perfect 10 a few years ago when it first came out and recalled having good results, so I purchased again on a whim because I didn&#x27;t want to pay a fortune at the salon for almost-black hair I didn&#x27;t like.  The results with Perfect 10 were excellent.  It&#x27;s quick, easy, and my hair felt silky soft.  I do not get that &amp;#34;I just colored my hair&amp;#34; feeling at all, not even in the first few days of coloring.  Best of all, I like being in control of my shades.  I have used the medium brown shade about every 6-7 weeks for a year and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  In fact I just recolored this morning and felt moved to write a review because the results are blowing me away again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. The color comes out perfect every time. My hair is soft, silky and shiny with little/no damage at all. I use the Medium Brown and strangers tell me how beautiful the color of my hair is. Saves me hundreds of dollars rather than going to a salon. Im not a huge fan of the smell of the conditioner, but its not too bad and it moisturizes well. I would recommend this to everyone EXCEPT those of you who are trying to lighten your hair... I would consult a professional in any curcumstances. This is my HG hair dye &lt;3</li>
    <li> Colorwise, Perfect 10 providest the best shades. I had random women on the street asking me where had I done my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, when the color penetrates your hair within 10 min and not like it used to be back in a day ( 30 min to an hour), you have to wonder how truly toxic it is.&lt;br /&gt;Both my mother and I used this product many times, and we both began noticing significantly more hair lost, even weeks after coloring. Granted, some hair loss is normal, and additional hair loss due to a chemical explosure, but not THAT much!&lt;br /&gt;From now on I will stay away from this product. Too bad they wont invest more money in making it less toxic to hair and a body, as opposed to waisting money on branding it to set themselves apart from other products.</li>
    <li> Easy and perfect price</li>
    <li> I like this color as it does not make my hair turn reddish.  The color doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like, as it fades rather quickly.  However as far as the color, it is the best I&#x27;e found for what I want in hair color.</li>
    <li> I will be brief.&lt;br /&gt;1. If you have a lot of grey it will not solidly cover it and washes out with in days if you wash your hair often.  It leaves a faded, lighter at the roots demarcation line and looks terrible.  But most of all,,, it dried the bejeebers out of my hair.  Would not recommend at all.  I by good fortune after much searching found a great, quality hair color that covers 90% grey without fade out and amazingly it left my hair softer than what I started with.... that would be Redken Color fusion.  My hair used to feel like rope after rinsing hair color.  Not with Redken!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair to cover grey since I was 18. This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used. The color is a very nice brunette, and it lasts as long as anything else out there. My hair always feels fuller and softer after using Perfect 10. The best part is it only takes 10 minutes, although, due to my stubborn greys I leave it on a little longer. But nowhere near the 40+ minutes of other products. Sadly, it&#x27;s been replaced by all this new foam stuff, which I tried and immediately hated, and Perfect 10 is getting hard to find. I used Amazon&#x27;s subscription program to buy it, so we&#x27;ll see how long THEY will be able to get it.</li>
    <li> LOVE THE IDEA OF HAVING ON HAIR FOR ONLY 10 MINUTES.....AND HAVE USED SEVERAL OF THE BROWNS AND BLACKS.....COLOR JUST DOES NOT LAST.</li>
    <li> I know that this seller also sells it in individual packs, but I ordered the one that specifically said &amp;#34;pack of 2&amp;#34; and paid twice what the pack of 1 cost. However, I only got one application box. Could have just been an error with my shipment, or it could just be incorrectly priced and mislabeled. It isn&#x27;t worth it to me to fight the seller on this, but if you&#x27;re thinking about ordering the 2-pack, you may want to contact the seller prior to purchase and make sure you&#x27;re getting what you think you are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the color is great. I don&#x27;t have many grays yet so can&#x27;t comment on gray coverage, but I do have tons of random blonde hairs randomly mixed in with my medium brown hair, and this made everything uniformly dark brown. Happy with the results and I especially like that it really only takes 10 minutes, unlike most color systems that seem to take 45+ minutes to color to their full potential.</li>
    <li> Used this product for years.  So easy and quick!  After application, just wait 10 MINUTES and rinse and condition and your hair is perfect.</li>
    <li> worked in 10 minutes, better than others in 40 minutes</li>
    <li> If you want great hair color, great coverage of grey, and don&#x27;t have hours to do it... this is the product for you.  I am too frugal, too impatient, and too busy to get the Professional Color that I would like to get.  As someone that llikes consistant color and ease of application, and 100% coverage, I like this Perfect 10 better than all the other products I&#x27;ve used over the last years.&lt;br /&gt;For some reason this product is not carried at the local corner pharmacy so Amazon makes it so easy to get what I want when I want it.</li>
    <li> No longer available in stored-perfect shade!</li>
    <li> Color works for me and it improves the condition of my hair.</li>
    <li> I really love Clairol Perfect 10 but I am still on a quest for my favorite color. If you have never tried Perfect 10 before it is revolutionary in hair color. It isn&#x27;t messy or drippy, there are no harsh smells (I have asthma and it doesn&#x27;t bother me like other hair dyes) and it only takes 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I previously colored my hair with 5A Medium Ash Brown nicknamed &amp;#34;swift chocolate&amp;#34; which was very pretty and natural looking and absolutely no red highlights show up just luscious brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;But I was looking for a bit of a change so I dropped down to the Medium Brown color which red highlights do appear only the ash can keep them from appearing but it just is too dark for me, I expected Medium Brown to be lighter than Medium Ash Brown but it isn&#x27;t and just has the addition of red mixed in. Next time, I think I will try Light Brown since I know it will not be too light. I&#x27;d hate to see how dark, the Dark Brown one looks.</li>
