      <li>This is a very nice style wig.  </li>
      <li>This really is a nice beautiful wig&lt;</li>
      <li>It loks good on</li>
      <li>I love this wig!  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>The hair is lovely!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It look so nice on me</li>
      <li>I received my wig and I was like ok it looks good.  </li>
      <li>Nice hair.</li>
      <li>I really like how the color matched perfectly.</li>
      <li>I love the hair on this...doesnot look like baby doll hair and everyone thought it was my own hair.  </li>
      <li>This has to be the best wig I&#x27;ve ever worn as I have never been able to get as natural of a look as I have now.</li>
      <li>a must have.  :)</li>
      <li>but I feel like I should be able to figure out how to wear this wig well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d love to see if I can get 1B</li>
      <li>If you are in a pinch, then this is a affordable wig you can buy until you can afford something better.</li>
      <li>thing is I&#x27;m hoping to find a wig just like this, but with more of a romance curl.</li>
      <li>Overall very pleased!!</li>
      <li>I love the way the wig feels and that I can use heat on it...</li>
      <li>I love this unit, all the joys of a u part wig without a two hundred dollar price tag.</li>
      <li>and it came out lovely.</li>
      <li>It came on time, and I love the texture, length, it doesn&#x27;t tangle.  </li>
      <li>wore it for a couple more weeks..</li>
      <li>I plan to purchase a 3-4 more of these as I am going natural and this is a great wig.</li>
      <li>I enjoy using this product, very light</li>
      <li>It looks so natural when I tried it on, very pleased!</li>
      <li>So, if the straight is all they have for now in this kind, I&#x27;ll take it until they release something with more of a curl.</li>
      <li>Other than that...a very nice look for cover up days when I need to perm or dye my hair!</li>
      <li>Nice feel and it fits very well.</li>
      <li>The wig is the most beautiful shade of off black.</li>
      <li>However, I don&#x27;t really like the type of hair as it tangles very easily.  </li>
      <li>Also it would be really great if it came in more colors than just jet black and 1B....</li>
      <li>I have this piece before in a different color and loved it too.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m loving how soft she is.</li>
      <li>I love it so much</li>
      <li>Not bad at all.</li>
      <li>Its light weight and more natural looking when wearing it.  </li>
      <li>It just came in the mail today and it looks like a fresh sew in.</li>
      <li>When blended with your own hair, Low shedding very soft easy to curl and style,Woud diffently purchase again.</li>
      <li>right up.</li>
      <li>Maybe it the climate, other than that my experience was pretty good</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable and the combs hurt just a little, but I have a strong feeling</li>
      <li>It looks very natural and you can&#x27;t beat the price!!!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to spend more time tomorrow braiding it and styling my hair properly.</li>
      <li>This was my second one I love it so much.</li>
      <li>The hair itself is nice but the contraption is a hot mess.</li>
      <li>On first inspection of the item, it iw the right color and matches my natural color.</li>
      <li>I ordered was very shiny , after a while gets very nappy.</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t really wear it.</li>
      <li>people thought it was my real hair</li>
      <li>Other than that I love the wig...</li>
      <li>I am now in search of a more human feeling hair in the same style.  </li>
      <li>The little combs in the top of this wig irritate my scalp a lil bit.</li>
      <li>i love weave, but this didn&#x27;t last long the clips popped out a couple weeks after purchasing this, but of course i saved it</li>
      <li>That says a lot for me as I normally don&#x27;t wear wigs at all.  </li>
      <li>Very soft realistic looking wig.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t play with my new hair just yet.</li>
      <li>but I fixed that as well...</li>
      <li>I did cut the closure because it was too had to style to give it a natural look as the picture shows.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like lace wigs or lace fronts as I can never get that natural look that I have now from this wig.</li>
      <li>and it give quite a natural look and feel for its price.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and they weren&#x27;t really that big because I wanted it to look flat when I wore the wig</li>

<li> and it give quite a natural look and feel for its price.&lt;br</li>
<li> and they weren&#x27;t really that big because I wanted it to look flat when I wore the wig</li>
<li> One was not completely attached and was hanging off.  </li>
<li> When it starts to fray, a little oil and a flat iron on very low fixes</li>
<li> So I replaced the clips with bigger ones and one of my track was not sewn down when I received it</li>
<li> It is a little too big</li>
<li> My only negative is that for me anyway, the clips hurt  in that I felt a constant pulling.  </li>
<li> I could only wear it a few times before it shed and matted.</li>
<li> super thin and the invisible part is confusing, product doesnt look as advertised,</li>
<li> Sheds just like any other wig.</li>
<li> The little combs attached would not stay closed.  </li>
<li> I ordered 1B and it&#x27;s way to dark to be 1B.  </li>
<li> I have thick hair and when I braid my cornrows just a little too big</li>
<li> Its soft and a little thin but nothing i cant work with.  </li>
<li> Remember ladies, you pay less- get less.</li>
<li> it was to difficult for me to put one and maintain a natural look.  </li>
<li> maybe it was a mistake, but just don&#x27;t have the money to waste</li>
<li> I would have preffered to save my money then to waste on it on this.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately my hair is braided up for the next month and a half to two months</li>
<li> and I did it like how small the wig clips were...</li>
<li> It does run small.</li>
<li> However, I was very unhappy with my recent order from HairSoFly, only because I ordered a 1B...</li>
<li> This wig SUCKS..</li>
<li> this crap didn&#x27;t even last a day like really do not purchase this</li>
<li> this hair was completely horrible can you say a hot mess</li>
<li> NO GOOD</li>
<li> confused on if supposed to cut or wear as is</li>
<li> Its thin like a wig on crack!</li>
<li> This is all wrong.</li>
<li> I think that because the hair is synthetic and the invisible part is located in an awkward position it make your hair look unnatural.</li>
<li> Also I thought the clips would be uncomfortable but they aren&#x27;t and they didn&#x27;t break my hair!</li>
<li> The combs don&#x27;t hurt that bad</li>
<li> Very disappointing!!!</li>
<li> it sheds like a sick DOG!!  </li>

    <li> This really is a nice beautiful wig&lt;br /&gt;It look so nice on me people thought it was my real hair I love it so much it&#x27;s a must have.  :)</li>
    <li> Great wig for the price.</li>
    <li> The hair is lovely! Its a wig but it doesnt look like omne....fits my head perfectlynand i love that it isn&#x27;t shine and looks fake....</li>
    <li> Too shiny, frizz ends. Well you can buy for Halloween costume, wear once and throw away. What an embarrasment! This should be taken off the market</li>
    <li> I have to buy another one. I did cut the closure because it was too had to style to give it a natural look as the picture shows. It&#x27;s very comfortable and the combs hurt just a little, but I have a strong feeling it&#x27;s because I have my hair brushed into a ponytail instead of braided like it should be. The combs don&#x27;t hurt that bad but it does hurt as all 3/4 wigs seem to do to my head. I&#x27;m going to spend more time tomorrow braiding it and styling my hair properly. This has to be the best wig I&#x27;ve ever worn as I have never been able to get as natural of a look as I have now. It just came in the mail today and it looks like a fresh sew in. Blends great with my hair as well. I plan to purchase a 3-4 more of these as I am going natural and this is a great wig. My boyfriend didn&#x27;t even know I was wearing a wig until I took it off for a minute lol!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing is I&#x27;m hoping to find a wig just like this, but with more of a romance curl. I don&#x27;t like lace wigs or lace fronts as I can never get that natural look that I have now from this wig. So, if the straight is all they have for now in this kind, I&#x27;ll take it until they release something with more of a curl.</li>
    <li> It came on time, and I love the texture, length, it doesn&#x27;t tangle.  The only issue is the color.  I ordered 1B and it&#x27;s way to dark to be 1B.  So I can&#x27;t wear it.  Also it would be really great if it came in more colors than just jet black and 1B....I&#x27;d love to see if I can get 1B maybe it was a mistake, but just don&#x27;t have the money to waste</li>
    <li> This wig SUCKS..it sheds like a sick DOG!!  Its thin like a wig on crack! NO GOOD&lt;br /&gt;I will NOT order this again.</li>
    <li> I ordered was very shiny , after a while gets very nappy.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice style wig.  I really like how the color matched perfectly. Its light weight and more natural looking when wearing it.  No one even knew it was a wig.  That says a lot for me as I normally don&#x27;t wear wigs at all.  However, I don&#x27;t really like the type of hair as it tangles very easily.

    <li> I love this wig!  It looks very natural and you can&#x27;t beat the price!!!  Also I thought the clips would be uncomfortable but they aren&#x27;t and they didn&#x27;t break my hair!</li>
    <li> this hair was completely horrible can you say a hot mess this crap didn&#x27;t even last a day like really do not purchase this and this weave will burn and fry lol nope !!!:(</li>
    <li> Nice hair. Got it but the length wasn&#x27;t for me so I cut it and it came out lovely. Nice feel and it fits very well.</li>
    <li> 5 stars because this wig is great for the price. I could only wear it a few times before it shed and matted. It does run small. Remember ladies, you pay less- get less.</li>
    <li> Very soft realistic looking wig.When blended with your own hair, Low shedding very soft easy to curl and style,Woud diffently purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love the way the wig feels and that I can use heat on it... It is a little too big and I did it like how small the wig clips were...I have thick hair and when I braid my cornrows just a little too big and they weren&#x27;t really that big because I wanted it to look flat when I wore the wig Amy way the clips would not snap... So I replaced the clips with bigger ones and one of my track was not sewn down when I received it but I fixed that as well... Other than that I love the wig... I will be purchasing the curly one as well</li>
    <li> I placed my order on saturday, it shipped on president&#x27;s day and was delivered today (wednesday). The wig is the most beautiful shade of off black. Unfortunately my hair is braided up for the next month and a half to two months so I can&#x27;t play with my new hair just yet. But I did take her out of the pkg and I&#x27;m loving how soft she is.</li>
    <li> i love weave, but this didn&#x27;t last long the clips popped out a couple weeks after purchasing this, but of course i saved it i just turned this into a glue in wore it for a couple more weeks.. cut cut cut until it was a bob... thrown away now.</li>
    <li> super thin and the invisible part is confusing, product doesnt look as advertised, confused on if supposed to cut or wear as is</li>
    <li> I love it! It looks so natural when I tried it on, very pleased! People thought it was my hair, and they also thought I cut my hair lol(my hair is longer than the wig). Ladies she is a beaut!!!</li>
    <li> Just received this piece today. On first inspection of the item, it iw the right color and matches my natural color. Its soft and a little thin but nothing i cant work with.  I have this piece before in a different color and loved it too. Overall very pleased!!</li>
    <li> The little combs in the top of this wig irritate my scalp a lil bit. It loks good on but I can&#x27;t really wear it.</li>
    <li> This was not Wat I thought it was and I don&#x27;t like it wasn&#x27;t for me</li>
    <li> Great wig for price. I had to cut the opening to work with it easier. Sheds just like any other wig. Not bad at all. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I received my wig and I was like ok it looks good.  Braided up my hair and left out enough to cover to create my part.  The little combs attached would not stay closed.  One was not completely attached and was hanging off.  I would have preffered to save my money then to waste on it on this.  The hair itself is nice but the contraption is a hot mess.</li>
    <li> I love the hair on this...doesnot look like baby doll hair and everyone thought it was my own hair.  I ended up separating the part as together it was to difficult for me to put one and maintain a natural look.  My only negative is that for me anyway, the clips hurt  in that I felt a constant pulling.  Also one of the clips would not lock at all, on my head or off....so I had to leave it open and cover the &amp;#34;bump&amp;#34; with hair...Other than that...a very nice look for cover up days when I need to perm or dye my hair!</li>
    <li> I love this unit, all the joys of a u part wig without a two hundred dollar price tag. This was my second one I love it so much. When it starts to fray, a little oil and a flat iron on very low fixes her right up. However, I was very unhappy with my recent order from HairSoFly, only because I ordered a 1B... the package said 1B but it was DEFINITELY a 1. Very disappointing!!!</li>
    <li> This is all wrong. I am not a hair dresser but I feel like I should be able to figure out how to wear this wig well. I think that because the hair is synthetic and the invisible part is located in an awkward position it make your hair look unnatural.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this product, very light and it give quite a natural look and feel for its price.&lt;br /&gt;However I would not advise that you use it to go to a partying, when moisture (sweat) gets on the hair its its hell to comb out. Maybe it the climate, other than that my experience was pretty good this is my 2nd one.</li>
