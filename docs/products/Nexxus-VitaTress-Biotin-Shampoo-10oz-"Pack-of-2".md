      <li>It&#x27;s also a very gentle and thorough clean (which is important since I was my hair every three or four days), and it doesn&#x27;t smell weird.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand why the medical professional is so lax.</li>
      <li>and it moisturizes my hair and gives it so much body without weighing my hair down.</li>

    <li> Great product still have a little bit falling hair not as bad before I started would recommend this to anyone who wants thick hair</li>
    <li> great shampoo - makes a difference in thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It really leaves my hair clean and manageable for days. I can go longer between washing; instead of every other day, every third or fourth day. My hair never looks greasy or flat. The only negative is the amount you have to use to get a good lather. Almost twice as much has my old shampoo. I do not have thinning hair. I ordered for my mother who is 90 and has thinning hair. Even though she is still finding just as many lost hairs in the drain; she also finds she doesn&#x27;t have to wash her hair as often, only once a week. It does tend to make her hair a little frizzy, but she is not able to dry her hair with a dryer, only air dry. Overall we both give it a thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know if this helps or not. It is too soon to tell. I can tell you that it makes your hair stiff. I use exquisite oil creme conditioner after it. The conditioner that goes with it makes my hair oily and stiff.</li>
    <li> Not doing what I expected but still a good product</li>
    <li> Tried this shampoo once and haven&#x27;t looked back since then. I simply love the results. Your hair will appreciate it, well worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. Have to go to beauty stores to get. Nexus changes names periodically so need to pay attention to description on bottles.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel great. Not very much thicker though.</li>
    <li> It seems to work on thinning hair.</li>
    <li> We are in our 70&#x27;s and the texture difference in our hair is amazing.</li>
    <li> Worth a try. Good price.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for a while now.  I ended up buying the 33oz after these two ran out.  Great for your hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo since May 2015, and I have noticed a huge difference in the amount of hair that ends up in my brush.  I am not losing nearly as much hair as I used to.  It&#x27;s also a very gentle and thorough clean (which is important since I was my hair every three or four days), and it doesn&#x27;t smell weird.  I have fine, back-length hair, and this is saving my strands.  Thank you Nexxus!</li>
    <li> I have yet to see the results of this shampoo,  I was so excited in receiving this but after 2 weeks of use I have yet to see any noticeable results.  I hope for better results in the future after continued usage.</li>
    <li> A Great product. You can actually see more shine in my hair, and my hair looks healthy and stronger. Great for thinning hair too.</li>
    <li> I have  used this product for three weeks and cannot say that there has been a difference in hair loss. I will continue to use both bottles in hopes that improvement will occur in time.</li>
    <li> I used this with the cream and my hair started growing in areas I never though it would. Great product!</li>
    <li> It does seem to make hair fuller. And a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Very good product.&lt;br /&gt;Have used it for years, but have trouble finding it locally.</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman with fine oily hair. This definitely dries out my hair beyond reason, but I counter it with African Pride olive oil conditioner and Organix biotin and collagen conditioner and it moisturizes my hair and gives it so much body without weighing my hair down.</li>
    <li> I know my hair is already benefitting with the use of this shampoo. It feels fuller and has more body. I am hoping to see if I start having less hair loss.</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;ve only used this in my past three washings and I feel like it&#x27;s helping.  It doesn&#x27;t smell and it soothes the scalp along with the nice suds it makes.  When I rinse if off, my hair is so clean that I have to use conditioner and then my hair is nice and smooth.  I&#x27;ve heard so many good reviews on this shampoo, so I&#x27;m praying it helps with repairing my hair loss.</li>
    <li> This brand is expensive but I&#x27;m seeing some results and I think it just take plenty of time for more/thicker hair to return.  Ain&#x27;t aging wonderful?  My hairdresser not my doctor knew exactly why my hair was thinning and the Biotin I needed to improve both my hair and my nails.  I don&#x27;t understand why the medical professional is so lax.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Smells wonderful and does a great job cleaning! Does not over dry my hair and my hair looks better when I use this over a different shampoo. Even when I use a &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; shampoo, my hair looks more full when I use this shampoo.</li>
    <li> my son uses this for hair loss very nice quality</li>
    <li> Love this product. I had found that my hair was breaking off and thinning. I did research and this product kept being suggested, so I decided t give it a try. I was amazed how it instantly gives you volume and within 30 days I started to notice less hair breaking off. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Amazing product and service! Will be purchasing again</li>
