      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this eyeliner however, this pen was faulty.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>It has clean lines, and is very easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t rub off but yet easy to remove.</li>
      <li>Glides on easy, doesn&#x27;t flake or smear.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t smudge and wipes off easily with a baby wipe.</li>
      <li>It creates a smooth, long-lasting liner that stays</li>
      <li>I tried A LOT of eyeliners and wasted A LOT of money on trying to find the perfect one.</li>
      <li>just like you put it on, and comes off easily without special remover.</li>
      <li>I checked my order to make sure I&#x27;d ordered the right color.</li>
      <li>I found this eyeliner a few years ago at an expo and absolutely loved it!</li>
      <li>The reason for not giving 5 stars, is because it dries up quickly, even after adding a touch of water.</li>
      <li>I had purchased some from the velvet website last year and really liked it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m working on the return process right now...</li>
      <li>I first saw this product at a fair and they put a little line on my finger and it didn&#x27;t come off with anything but makeup remover.</li>
      <li>have tried alot of different ones but just love this one.</li>
      <li>I finally found it here and was so excited!</li>
      <li>I have purchased this in the past and LOVED it.  </li>
      <li>The first day or two it went fairly easily but by the 5th day it was nearly dry and dragged my eyelid.</li>
      <li>If it starts to get low, run the tip under a light stream of water and you&#x27;ll get another month out of it...</li>
      <li>I really like this eyeliner.</li>
      <li>The applicator allows for more precision than any other liquid eyeliner on the market.  </li>
      <li>The ink dry out very quick</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s truly disappointing because I do love them and am not having success in finding another eyeliner I love.</li>
      <li>Charcoal is more translucent than black is</li>
      <li>This product was nice the first day, but it dried out WAY to quickly and was not worth this price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This is seriously the best investment because one lasts you so long, i still have the one i bought back in December 2012.</li>
      <li>I was able to remove half of it easily with a little water.  </li>
      <li>I was sent a new one and it was also charcoal.</li>
      <li>It has a quick dry time also.</li>
      <li>Then I looked at the packaging it came in, that also said &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; but they sent me &amp;#34;charcoal.&amp;#34;  I might have even been willing to  just deal with the color mistake if the eyeliner had only worked!&lt;br</li>
      <li>It seems to be an old eye liner.  </li>
      <li>even the kind you dip in that little bottle of black ink.</li>
      <li>but I am sure it will not last as long as my other ones.  </li>
      <li>Not surprising, as I suspect most of it leaked out.  </li>
      <li>I love this eyeliner, and have bought several over the last few years.  </li>

<li> I love this eyeliner, and have bought several over the last few years.  </li>
<li> My old eyeliner took a long time to dry and would go all over when I blinked, but not this stuff!!!</li>
<li> It lasted sooo long.</li>
<li> It lasts a long time as well.</li>
<li> and they are completely dry.</li>
<li> i bought the product and wore it every single day.</li>
<li> I tried it over and over again, but absolutely no color would come out.</li>
<li> Not to the standard that I have gotten in the past.</li>
<li> I found if I get the tip a little wet</li>
<li> i purchased this again and it was charcoal instead of black.  </li>
<li> This eyeliner lasted less than a week.</li>
<li> think I got maybe a week and a half out of it,</li>
<li> Ordered this product for my mother and we did not get black, we got charcoal.</li>
<li> I ordered black.</li>
<li> But it totally does not last long, especially if you use eye cream or base.</li>
<li> Makes for a gloppy mess.  </li>
<li> Not worth the price!</li>
<li> This item came to me almost completely dried up.</li>
<li> but these were dried out upon arrival.</li>
<li> It was dried up when I received it.  </li>
<li> and she uses it everyday and it lasted months.</li>
<li> The eyeliner is nearly dried out now (after just a couple months if that).  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;ve dried out or if the quality is not there anymore.</li>
<li> Unfortunately the last few that I&#x27;ve purchased have not worked well.</li>
<li> This purchase is extremely disappointing as the product that was shipped is all dried out and completely unusable.</li>
<li> I usually swear by this eyeliner.</li>
<li> and then it dried out!</li>
<li> but it was too late to return by the time I realized it was not functional.</li>
<li> In fac,t it lasted at least two years!  </li>
<li> The mechanism in the pen that feeds the eyeliner may have been broken.</li>
<li> Maybe I have weird skin, but this stuff does not stay on me.  </li>
<li> and she didn&#x27;t notice it said charcoal until after the 30 day return policy so we are unable to get a return and get the correct color.</li>
<li> I do use eye cream as well as eye shadow base.  </li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t use anything else for liquid eyeliner.  I&#x27;ve tried countless types but I come back to this every time.  The applicator allows for more precision than any other liquid eyeliner on the market.  Give it a try and I guarantee you will LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I returned this. I had purchased some from the velvet website last year and really liked it but these were dried out upon arrival.</li>
    <li> I loved this product when I got it at a women&#x27;s expo but both times I ordered it it only lasted a couple weeks and then it dried out! Not worth the price!</li>
    <li> I have tried every eyeliner out there, liquid and pencil.. even the kind you dip in that little bottle of black ink. None of them worked as well as this one. I first saw this product at a fair and they put a little line on my finger and it didn&#x27;t come off with anything but makeup remover. i bought the product and wore it every single day. It lasted sooo long. I was so impressed i looked it up online and hoped it was on amazon. This is seriously the best investment because one lasts you so long, i still have the one i bought back in December 2012. Its so easy to use and leave an amazing finish! You put it on in the morning and even if you touch your eye or cry or anything, the same line you put that morning stays until you take it off with makeup remover. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner, and have bought several over the last few years.  The reason for not giving 5 stars, is because it dries up quickly, even after adding a touch of water.</li>
    <li> This item came to me almost completely dried up. I would have returned it but it was too late to return by the time I realized it was not functional.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner however, this pen was faulty.  It was dried up when I received it.  The mechanism in the pen that feeds the eyeliner may have been broken.</li>
    <li> would have given 5 statrs, but it is pricey.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the product before and been very happy with it.  This purchase is extremely disappointing as the product that was shipped is all dried out and completely unusable.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this in the past and LOVED it.  In fac,t it lasted at least two years!  Can&#x27;t say I am happy at all this time.  There seems to be a leak where the tip is attached to the barrel.  Makes for a gloppy mess.  Emailed the company to request a replacement.  Did not get a response.  The eyeliner is nearly dried out now (after just a couple months if that).  Not surprising, as I suspect most of it leaked out.  Bummer.</li>
    <li> Found this and my fiancé had mentioned she loved it, but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. For the price it was a great deal and she uses it everyday and it lasted months.</li>
    <li> I usually swear by this eyeliner. It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ll use. Unfortunately the last few that I&#x27;ve purchased have not worked well. I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;ve dried out or if the quality is not there anymore. It&#x27;s truly disappointing because I do love them and am not having success in finding another eyeliner I love.</li>
    <li> The ink dry out very quick</li>
    <li> I found this eyeliner a few years ago at an expo and absolutely loved it! I used it for a couple years, then couldn&#x27;t find it anymore.I finally found it here and was so excited! I immediately ordered it, and I thought my eyeliner problems had been solved. Nope. It didn&#x27;t work, at all! I tried it over and over again, but absolutely no color would come out. Then I noticed that the actual eyeliner pen said &amp;#34;charcoal&amp;#34;, not &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; like I&#x27;d ordered. I checked my order to make sure I&#x27;d ordered the right color. Yep. I ordered black. Then I looked at the packaging it came in, that also said &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; but they sent me &amp;#34;charcoal.&amp;#34;  I might have even been willing to  just deal with the color mistake if the eyeliner had only worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m working on the return process right now...</li>
    <li> Glides on easy, doesn&#x27;t flake or smear.  Doesn&#x27;t rub off but yet easy to remove. Love, love, love this eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I tried A LOT of eyeliners and wasted A LOT of money on trying to find the perfect one. Well, I’ve finally found it. This is it people. Give it a shot, you&#x27;ll love it too. It&#x27;s worth every penny. It lasts a long time as well. If it starts to get low, run the tip under a light stream of water and you&#x27;ll get another month out of it...yes, a month!</li>
    <li> From John&#x27;s wife, Sheila:  I have tried many pencil, liquid and gel liners searching for the perfect product. This is it! It creates a smooth, long-lasting liner that stays just like you put it on, and comes off easily without special remover. Perfect in every way.</li>
    <li> Maybe I have weird skin, but this stuff does not stay on me.  I do use eye cream as well as eye shadow base.  I even tried it on my arm tonight and waited 20 minutes before touching it.  (The claim is after 10, it will not come off, smudge, flake or smear and it can be used while swimming with the same effects.)  I was able to remove half of it easily with a little water.  The rest came off with a good rub - no water or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely does not flake - they have that!  But it totally does not last long, especially if you use eye cream or base.</li>
    <li> I really like this eyeliner. It is the only one that I&#x27;ve found that stays on all day.  It goes on smooth and looks great.  I have oily eye lids and this works well.  Sometimes it won&#x27;t go on. I found if I get the tip a little wet then it goes on without a problem. Love this!</li>
    <li> It seems to be an old eye liner.  It does not flow as well as the others I have bought.  I didn&#x27;t want to send it back because it would have cost me so I will use it but I am sure it will not last as long as my other ones.  i purchased this again and it was charcoal instead of black.  I was sent a new one and it was also charcoal.</li>
    <li> Velvet is without a doubt the smoothest eyeliner I ever used.  It goes on easily and stays on!  I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I bought three and they are completely dry. Not to the standard that I have gotten in the past.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product for my mother and we did not get black, we got charcoal. Charcoal is more translucent than black is and she didn&#x27;t notice it said charcoal until after the 30 day return policy so we are unable to get a return and get the correct color.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner lasted less than a week. The first day or two it went fairly easily but by the 5th day it was nearly dry and dragged my eyelid. I will not ever buy this again !</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smudge and wipes off easily with a baby wipe.</li>
    <li> I love it. you can put it on with a real fine line or make it thicker. have tried alot of different ones but just love this one.</li>
    <li> This product was nice the first day, but it dried out WAY to quickly and was not worth this price.&lt;br /&gt;I think I got maybe a week and a half out of it, and that was it.</li>
    <li> Love these eyeliners!</li>
    <li> Good product easy to use!</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT! It goes on so smooth, and STAYS ON!!! It has clean lines, and is very easy to apply. It has a quick dry time also. My old eyeliner took a long time to dry and would go all over when I blinked, but not this stuff!!! Does not get &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34;  or &amp;#34;flakey&amp;#34;. LOVE IT!</li>
