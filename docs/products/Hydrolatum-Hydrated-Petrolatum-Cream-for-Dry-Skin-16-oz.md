      <li>Perfect for dry skin conditions.</li>
      <li>Best thing ever for dry skin &amp; eczema.</li>
      <li>Excellent moisturizer for extremely dry skin.</li>
      <li>Myself, my girlfriend, and my 2 year old daughter all use it after the shower with great results.</li>
      <li>Works great for eczema on young children.  </li>
      <li>Sweet cream!</li>
      <li>Very safe and gentle.</li>
      <li>it &#x27;s a very good cream for dry skin.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t enjoy that at all</li>
      <li>Completely worth it though!</li>
      <li>This is far the best cream on the market today that actually works.</li>
      <li>This cream works great to get rid of dry skin.</li>
      <li>It moisterize skin really well.. much better than petrolium jelly and retains moister well.  </li>
      <li>My dermatologist had given me some hydrated petrolateum for my eczema that he mixed up himself and this stuff is almost as good.</li>
      <li>He didn&#x27;t scratch as much, and was able to sleep at night without itching.  </li>
      <li>This reseller was quick and I got my product within two days.</li>
      <li>It has made a tremendous difference on his skin.  </li>
      <li>and the the other drug store brands, this is by far the best.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still amazing every time someone compliments me on her \\&quot;pretty, soft skin\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>It is also great for any kind of run of the mill dry skin - chapped lips, dry feet, cuticles, etc.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to use any steroid cream (unless I really had to) and this cream helped tremendously!  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need to put on a whole lot and my skin looks so smooth and hydrated.</li>
      <li>And just like magic, within days her skin began to clear up.</li>
      <li>This cream is well worth it.</li>
      <li>My doctor told me to get this, and it really worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Best kept secret</li>
      <li>I tried every product you can imagine without success.</li>
      <li>I recommend it as it is not a medicine rather a great skin mosterizer for eczema / severe dry skin condition that can be used as frequently as needed.    </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s cheaper and much more effective without the thick frosting consistency</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone with a baby with dry skin of any kind or severity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:</li>
      <li>After about 3 weeks her skin was perfectly smooth, soft, and silky.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also recommended this product for friends that have complained about cracked skin and it worked great for them.  </li>
      <li>I can use it daily and it works better than Aquaphor.</li>
      <li>Skin then feels smooth and soft (unheard of for a child with severe eczema).</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and keeps her skin soft.  </li>
      <li>Hopefully it temporary as I haven&#x27;t been able to find this locally at stores either.</li>
      <li>Hydrolatum is the first cream we used on her that didn&#x27;t have steroids</li>
      <li>You have to be consistent in applying it nightly and spread liberally over areas...</li>
      <li>and since I&#x27;ve been doing Bikram Yoga for the past year, I get these periods where I have fairly sizeable cracks appearing where my fingernail meets the fleshy tip of my fingers.</li>
      <li>It does not AT ALL have the feel of petroleum jelly or any of the other more famous brands that come in similar tubs.  </li>
      <li>It certainly helps her irritated skin.</li>
      <li>Hydrolatum is absorbed into the skin within a few minutes and results in a remarkable improvement in red patches on her skin.</li>
      <li>But that is VERY greasy.  </li>
      <li>Has really helped with our sons excema.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Thanks so much,</li>
      <li>Over the summer our baby&#x27;s skin was better and we didn&#x27;t use Hydrolatum, but as winter rolled around with drier air, his skin started to get rough and scaly again.  </li>
      <li>For heels, prepare your feet and put as much as you want on the problem area.</li>
      <li>We applied it morning and night (twice a day total), and within a week his skin went from ragged to smooth.  </li>
      <li>but it really controls bumps and itching!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>It lasts longer than any other brand, and I&#x27;ve tried most of them.</li>
      <li>This works better than other petroleum-based ointments or creams I&#x27;ve tried for dry-skin eczema.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s softer, less sticky, and generally more comforting than the others.</li>
      <li>Great for tiny dry patches and for repairing dry heels.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend and will purchase again.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend your family giving this product a shot...</li>
      <li>My 5 month old son had mild eczema on his back, belly and legs.</li>
      <li>My kids live this stuff works well on her skin.</li>
      <li>MY SON HAS EZEMA, VERY SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not a magical cure, but seems to help keep Eczema in check.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good moisturizer BUT VERY VERY GREASY and NOT QUICKLY ABSORBED BY THE SKIN.</li>
    <li> THIS LOTION IS THE BEST!!!! MY SON HAS EZEMA, VERY SENSITIVE SKIN. THIS WORKS WONDERFUL.  ITS NOT GREASY AND ABSORBS NICE.</li>
    <li> I apply this cream at night on my hands then wear a pair of white cotton gloves (ordered on-line) to allow the lotion to go to work.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice, I like it.</li>
    <li> Hydrolatum works wonders on dry, cracked feet.  It&#x27;s been discontinued so grab it while you can!!</li>
    <li> When used in combination with AmLactin this has cured my son&#x27;s exzema and dry peeling feet...this is also great for applying to my own nasty dry runners feet...at night especially. I do recommend</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Keeps my eczema away! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I purchased this cream because I had chronic dry skin/eczema on my arms and legs. This cream works great to get rid of dry skin. It soaks in well and does not have any scent and does not have a bunch of irritable ingredients! Perfect for dry skin conditions. The jar is large, so this cream will last for a very very long time.</li>
    <li> This product healed my cracked skin over this terrible dry winter.  I highly recommend it.  It works wonders without a greasy film</li>
    <li> While this is a little greasy it soaks in well and has helped me manage my eczema. The tub will last a long time because a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Sweet cream! Protects awesome and puts a nice barrier on skin to retain moisture. Myself, my girlfriend, and my 2 year old daughter all use it after the shower with great results.</li>
    <li> I have eczema and severely dry skin and this product did not work for me. I didn&#x27;t care for the texture or consistency. I like Aquaphor better.</li>
    <li> Very good indeed. fills in the dry skin better than on ordinary lotion, but not as greasy as the vaseline-type ointments. You can run it into the skin until it is not greasy and staining. Recommended to me by a small-town pharmacist who herself had eczema, and is the best thing of this kind that I have found - and I have tried them all, believe me.</li>
    <li> My daughter suffered terribly as a child from eczema and Hydrolatum was recommended to us by Children&#x27;s Hospital in Boston.  She is now 18 and still uses it from time to time - it is the absolute best!  It is also great for any kind of run of the mill dry skin - chapped lips, dry feet, cuticles, etc.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised that this cream is regarded as greasy and not easily absorbed by some people.  It does not AT ALL have the feel of petroleum jelly or any of the other more famous brands that come in similar tubs.  This has helped cure my perpetually dry and cracked hands, cuticles, and heels.  I haven&#x27;t tried it yet on lips, but will.  After spending hundreds on cosmetic counter brands ($30-$50 a tube!) and the the other drug store brands, this is by far the best.</li>
    <li> My doctor told me to get this, and it really worth every penny. For dry skin or rash, I typically notice dramatic changes over night. Since it&#x27;s such a big bottle, I packed them into small traveling containers and gave out as little gifts.</li>
    <li> The best.  Purchased with the advice of our pediatrician.</li>
    <li> My child has eczema this cream is the best. I told my doctor about it now she has been telling everyone.</li>
    <li> My infant daughter had terrible eczema all over her legs, especially on the backs of her knees, where the skin was cracked, raw and thickened. She also had patches on her arms and behind her ears. I tried every product you can imagine without success. Finally I took her to a dermatologist, who recommended Hydrolatum. At the doctor&#x27;s suggestion, I greased her up head to toe after every bath, and reapplied the cream on her legs at every diaper change. And just like magic, within days her skin began to clear up. After about 3 weeks her skin was perfectly smooth, soft, and silky. It was amazing. It&#x27;s still amazing every time someone compliments me on her \\&quot;pretty, soft skin\\&quot;. I recommend this cream to everyone I know who has a kid with eczema. Nothing works better. It&#x27;s truly a miracle product.</li>
    <li> This cream is a miracle, it smoothes even the rougher skins. I have really dry skin, but hydrolatum keeps my face moistens all day. It is also great when you get sun burned.</li>
    <li> Everytime I receive this product (my son uses a jar every two weeks) the cream has leaked out of the jar. The outside of the jar is typically covered in creme when I receive it.  It&#x27;s pretty annoying. The last time I received it (just last week), part of the body of the jar was cracked.  The creme is itself is great - I use it to treat my son&#x27;s eczema - but the packaging can be drastically improved.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for restoring moisture to your hands during the night. Use the white cotton gloves to hold the moisture.</li>
    <li> My son has eczema. Initially I tried Aquafor, Aveeno and several other \\&quot;eczema creams\\&quot;...none worked that well. Then someone recommended Hydrolatum and I cannot say enough about how well it works! You have to be consistent in applying it nightly and spread liberally over areas...but it really controls bumps and itching!&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is that it&#x27;s so thick it leaves skin w/ wet feeling making it difficult to get arms thru pj sleeves. Completely worth it though!</li>
    <li> My son has eczema. This is the only (non medicated) cream that works. I can use it daily and it works better than Aquaphor.</li>
    <li> I have moderate eczema on my hands inner elbow and the top of my shoulders and have been buying different brands to see what works for me I tried this for a week and had to give up on it when my itching woke me up in the morning so badly I had to take antihistamines and run to the drug store for good moisturizer to stop it. I didn&#x27;t find it worked as well ad other brands like cetaphil skin restoring moisturizer or curel itch defense. This product is soo thick it&#x27;s like lathering frosting on your skin I didn&#x27;t enjoy that at all, I know other reviewers said they found it to be the same consistency as other eczema products but it&#x27;s not and I&#x27;ve tried at least 7 different brands I would recommend buying brands that the national eczema association recommendation on the bottle... My recommendation would be skip this stuff and buy the curel itch denfense at your local pharmacy it&#x27;s cheaper and much more effective without the thick frosting consistency also any other eczema sufferers try eczemahelp.ca that website was a lifesaver for me</li>
    <li> My baby had a TERRIBLE skin breakout that seemed to be eczema over every inch of her head and neck and other parts of her body. No matter what I tried it was not getting better and we were looking at having to put he on medication which I wanted to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this on a fluke on amazon and ordered it to see if it would work. This stuff is AMAZING. It cleared up my baby&#x27;s skin within a couple weeks and it has kept her skin perfect and clear since. I apply usually once a day. I also apply it every time I see something starting to appear randomly on her skin and it ALWAYS ALWAYS gets rid of it and prevents anything from flaring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best stuff I have ever seen and it&#x27;s safe for baby and anyone. More information is on their website</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any skin problems, I use it on a daily basis when my skin gets dry; I think it is better than using regular lotion.  I don&#x27;t need to put on a whole lot and my skin looks so smooth and hydrated.</li>
    <li> Daughter has eczema and allergist suggested this. I like it. Little greasy but sinks right in!</li>
    <li> I buy it for my infant daughther&#x27;s eczema per dermatelogist recommendation.  It moisterize skin really well.. much better than petrolium jelly and retains moister well.  It certainly helps her irritated skin. I recommend it as it is not a medicine rather a great skin mosterizer for eczema / severe dry skin condition that can be used as frequently as needed.    -Mohammed</li>
    <li> I discovered hydrolatum about five years ago! I learned about it on blog discussing natural alternatives of treating eczema and dry skin for my son. Hydrolatum cream locks in moisture well! The coating of this petroleum is thick but leaves a shine barrier that lasts for hours! I have given this product to friends and recommended it to desperate mothers and fathers who want to ease the pain and aggravation of this horrible skin disease. I HIGHLY recommend your family giving this product a shot...everyone can use it! Enjoy!</li>
    <li> My son had baby eczema and this is the only cream that worked!!  I didn&#x27;t want to use any steroid cream (unless I really had to) and this cream helped tremendously!  Maybe he would have grown out of it but this helped with the itching and comfort along the way!!</li>
    <li> Has really helped with our sons excema. Our pediatrician recommended it and said its gentle enough to use several times a day on our baby. It is greasy though, so it does get on your hands and clothes.</li>
    <li> Works great for eczema on young children.  It&#x27;s a little greasy at first but it does quite well especially at night before bed time.</li>
    <li> We have been using this product on my daughter since she was born. She is now almost 3 years old and we use this on her skin every night after her bath. It has kept her skin soft and hydrated. Very safe and gentle.</li>
    <li> This is the best for eczema.  I can even use it on my face.  It lasts longer than any other brand, and I&#x27;ve tried most of them.</li>
    <li> This cream has worked wonders for my 1 year old&#x27;s eczema.  We realized she&#x27;s allergic to animals (we have two cats and a dog) and several foods.  We got rid of nuts from our house so that her brothers weren&#x27;t touching her with peanut butter fingers, got some air purifiers and started giving her nightly baths (no soap) to wash off environmentally allergens.  So, we changed several things at once and saw dramatic improvement.  When I think about how itchy, red and scaly she used to be, I cry.  We have used aquaphor and triple cream but neither work as well as hydrolatum.  It&#x27;s a little more expensive here than at our local pharmacy - you need to ask for it at the pharmacy counter because they don&#x27;t pay for shelf space at cvs, apparently.</li>
    <li> Our baby had crazy bad eczema combined with seborrhea, doctors were pretty surprised and didn&#x27;t really know how to treat it.  It affected his entire body, and was worse behind his knees, elbows...anywhere the skin creased.  Went to a specialist, and in addition to 2.5% hydro-cortisone for the particularly bad areas, he recommended hydrolatum.  This product was a Godsend.  We applied it morning and night (twice a day total), and within a week his skin went from ragged to smooth.  He didn&#x27;t scratch as much, and was able to sleep at night without itching.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone with a baby with dry skin of any kind or severity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Over the summer our baby&#x27;s skin was better and we didn&#x27;t use Hydrolatum, but as winter rolled around with drier air, his skin started to get rough and scaly again.  We pulled out the hydrolatum, and apply it each night after his bath.  Still a lifesaver.</li>
    <li> It does help to clear the skin, I&#x27;ve been using it for somet6ime and have recommended to friends and family.</li>
    <li> Finally after 50 years I&#x27;ve found a cream that takes care of eczema and that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out in blisters. The grease some people have commented on is only for five - ten minutes, which I have no complaints about.</li>
    <li> This product was prescribed for the family due to allergies and sensitive skin. This product is great for this bitter cold weather. It keeps my skin moistured and blocks out the cold.</li>
    <li> Best cream ever for Eczema. I&#x27;ve been using this product for my daughter ever since she was a baby. She is now five years old and every time we visit the pediatrician they always compliment me on her skin because you cannot even tell she has eczema. This is far the best cream on the market today that actually works. The trick is to apply the cream right after showering or bath when the skin in wet and it locks in the moisture all day long. It&#x27;s not sold anywhere else but online however, you could request that your neighborhood drugstore order the product and you could just pick it up or have it shipped to you home.This cream is well worth it.</li>
    <li> This is the Holy Grail of moisturizers!</li>
    <li> My daughter has severe to moderate eczema and previously per her dermatologist we have used aquaphor in combination with steroid ointments as needed.  But that is VERY greasy.  We are on day 3 of this stuff and LOVE IT.  It is a cream not an ointment.  It is not as thick as some creams you find in the drug stores that come in the same type tubs. It goes on smooth and keeps her skin soft.  I&#x27;m very impressed so far. I just wish the price was a little less per tub.  Even she says she likes it!</li>
    <li> It was delivered on time. Packaged well it wasn&#x27;t leaking when I received it. My kids live this stuff works well on her skin.</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff! My local pharmacy no longer carries it for some reason...they said the manufacturer has either run out or has discontinued the product so I took matters into my own hands, lol. I love the cream, I&#x27;ve been using it for over 20 years now. It&#x27;s thick enough to moisturize the skin but doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy. Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> My daughter has eczema and needs to moisturize her skin constantly. Hydrolatum is the first cream we used on her that didn&#x27;t have steroids and it actually worked. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I  purchased Hydrolatum for dry skin on my heels and elbows.  I also purchased another tub for a friend that has psoriasis and it has made a very big difference for him.  Not only is his skin staying moist, but the flakiness and patches are less noticeable.  The think to remember is to be sure and use it every morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much,</li>
    <li> it &#x27;s a very good cream for dry skin. I use it every day, morning and night. I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> You only need a tiny bit for it to work and this is a big tub! Great for tiny dry patches and for repairing dry heels. A small amount should be used on the dry area only. Other areas that are not effected should be avoided because the cream is very heavy. For heels, prepare your feet and put as much as you want on the problem area. Then wear socks overnight...</li>
    <li> My dermatologist had given me some hydrated petrolateum for my eczema that he mixed up himself and this stuff is almost as good. Definitely a good price and helps keep my skin super moisturized.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a year now.  Love it, perfect for my dry skin. It&#x27;s definitely thick, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I&#x27;ve also recommended this product for friends that have complained about cracked skin and it worked great for them.  This reseller was quick and I got my product within two days. Thank You!</li>
    <li> My 5 month old son had mild eczema on his back, belly and legs. A friend recommended this to me and it did the trick. We put it on three times a day for a week or two and it was much better. Now I just put some on him once a day before bed. I now recommended it to other moms.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have eczema, but during the winter and since I&#x27;ve been doing Bikram Yoga for the past year, I get these periods where I have fairly sizeable cracks appearing where my fingernail meets the fleshy tip of my fingers. Wow do they hurt. I tried all sorts of lotions, but this is the only one that really makes a big difference. I can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to us by our pediatrician  and we have ordered it a few times and it works very well. Not happy to see that it&#x27;s not available though. Hopefully it temporary as I haven&#x27;t been able to find this locally at stores either.</li>
    <li> Hydrolatum is a WONDERFUL product! My 2 1/2 year old daughter has eczema aggrivated by food allergies. While aquifor provided temporary relief, the red patches almost never went away (unless I used prescription steriod cream) and the product was very greasy and took a long time to absorb. Hydrolatum is absorbed into the skin within a few minutes and results in a remarkable improvement in red patches on her skin. Skin then feels smooth and soft (unheard of for a child with severe eczema). This was recommended by other eczema moms, as well as my pharmacist and allergist!</li>
    <li> We use this for our daughter&#x27;s &amp;#34;extreme&amp;#34; eczema after bath to seal in the moisture.  We use it for the other kids who have minor skin issues too.  Doesn&#x27;t sting her if she is broken out.  I tried all things natural, but this works the best.  Petroleum jelly and water. That&#x27;s it.  Nothing else to irritate.</li>
    <li> This works better than other petroleum-based ointments or creams I&#x27;ve tried for dry-skin eczema. It&#x27;s softer, less sticky, and generally more comforting than the others.</li>
    <li> Hydrolatum is the answer to keep eczema in check.  We grease our 3 month old from head to toe.  For especially cracked areas like behind knees and elbows we use Destin.  We also bath her in Chaomile tea.  So soothing.  Since using this regieme 3x a day, our baby is less fussy and happier.  She now sleeps happily all night without the irratation and itch!  So thankful that our Dermatologist told us about Hdrolatum.  We tried everything else and nothing helped.</li>
    <li> Very good product and not too greasy.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> Best thing ever for dry skin &amp; eczema. Used Aquaphora, Vaseline &amp; many others...nothing as good as this. Best kept secret</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer for extremely dry skin. Long lasting.</li>
    <li> My 1 year old has horrible, itchy and even painful eczema flair-ups, and after trying a countless number of other products (Aveeno, Aquaphor, Triple Cream, etc), his allergist suggested this.  It has made a tremendous difference on his skin.  We bathe him in warm water everyday and then butter him up like a little turkey with the Hydrolatum, and it&#x27;s made a big difference sealing in moisture.  Highly recommend and will purchase again.</li>
