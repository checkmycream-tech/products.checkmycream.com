<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Different smell than store bought, not convinced it&#x27;s the authentic product</li>
    <li> This shampoo did nothing good for my hair.  It faded my color (by the time I finished the tube) and left my hair unmanageable and dry.  I have since found a much, much better sulfate free hair care line, Shea Moisture, that leaves my hair soft, supple and shiny.  I have tried a number of different Loreal sulfate free shampoos and whatever is in them, doesn&#x27;t agree with my hair.  They don&#x27;t lather as well as SM and all of them stripped my color to some degree.  I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything special about my hair type (medium texture, somewhat wavy and prone to frizz) but my hair was a ball of fuzziness when I used the Loreal shampoos/conditioners and SM keeps it very smooth and frizz free.  SM also doesn&#x27;t contain silicone, there&#x27;s some natural ingredient that prevents frizz, which is a very good thing.  I prefer SM or Living Proof to Loreal.  Sometimes, you get what you pay for!  I definitely don&#x27;t recommend this shampoo or any of the conditioners.</li>
    <li> Disappointed. I used this shampp and conditioner for 2 weeks. My hair got very dry and had so much static it was embarrassing. It is too bad because i really liked how good my hair smelled.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at the suds with this. You always hear Sulfate-free stuff has bad suds, but not this one. It cleans well, to boot.</li>
    <li> I used it once per week to keep my hair shining and soft. It boots my volume and now I don&#x27;t have frizz.</li>
    <li> I am a hair products junkie and I have tried dozens of sulfate-free shampoos. I always come back to this one. It is very rich and thick, lathers well, smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my colored hair or strip it. I will continue to buy this.</li>
    <li> it has a nice smell and my hair looks and feel really good after using it for the past few days!</li>
    <li> This works just as well as the very expensive Redken shampoo I had been purchasing to keep my color vibrant.  It does clean my hair well, although if I&#x27;ve been using a lot of hair products I&#x27;ll use a regular shampoo for a clarifying treatment about once every other week.</li>
    <li> This product DOES NOT strip color from color-treated hair.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I love it a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. The smell is very strong but it&#x27;s a great smell to me, and the shampoo does not strip my hair of the oils that I naturally need. It&#x27;s a keeper for me!</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo after using other SLS free products that were more expensive but worked wonderfully. My dandruff and hair loss were cured! I tried this out to save a bit of money. Big mistake!! After the first wash my dandruff and hair loss were back. I also tried the conditioner and it left my hair limp and greasy. The smell was terrible even after drying my hair. There was no running from it and was so obnoxious my husband even commented on it. Like another reviewer said - there are sulfates on the label - but aside from that this shampoo foams way too much to be truly SLS free. This was a complete waste of money and I ended up throwing it away after trying it twice.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner was AWFUL.  Left my hair with soo much residue and made it  greay and weighed down. I had to re-wash my  hair 3 times after originally using it because the  residue was so thick and sticky. It also made my hair  smell greasy. DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. Love the smell and love the way my hair feels.  I have good hair days when I use this and the conditioner too. :)</li>
    <li> All everpure line are great. Loreal are the best for hair products. The sulfate free products are really good for my hair. I really like my purchase.</li>
    <li> This shampoo made my scalp itchy and flaky!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I thought it would be gentle on my hair. I used it for a few months and was experiencing dry brittle hair and clumps of hair in the shower drain every day. My Dr even tested my for thyroid issues after a couple of hairdressers commented on my thinning hair and I&#x27;m a female in my early 30s. Ran out of shampoo one day and dug an old bottle of Pantene out of the closest. It&#x27;s only been a week and I&#x27;m not pulling gobs of hair out of the drain everyday anymore! I wish I had put it together sooner or paid more attention to the negative reviews before! Hubby said it was drying his hair out as well, although my hair is finer than his and it wasn&#x27;t as extreme for him.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a gentle shampoo since my hair has been through dyes and perms. Since this product was promoted as sulfate-free and made for colored hair I went for it. Overall this product has been a disappointment since it leaves my hair feeling dryer and greasier after use. This shampoo also has an overpowering rose scent reminiscent of old ladies&#x27; perfume.  I do NOT recommend this product.</li>
    <li> the item may be counterfeited as the packaging does not match the picture.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to sulfate based shampoos, and currently I use Bedhead Superstar. I don&#x27;t know why but after a month, my scalp was breaking out in dandruff and itchy rashes as if I had been using a regular shampoo. Reading the ingredients on the back, I was not impressed. I am by no means a chemist, but I do not believe this is as much of a sulfate free shampoo as they say. The main ingredients on the back are &#x27;sodium cocyl isethonate, sodium lauryl SULFoactate, disodium laureth SULFfosuccinate, and sodium lauyrl sarcosinate&#x27;. That does not seem as sulfate free as other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ll take a big pass on this.</li>
    <li> I had just bleached my hair and got it colored and it was extremely dry at the ends and I was worried that my hair would break, and just grabbed the first sulfate free color care shampoo and conditioner I could find. It happened to be this brand and I absolutely love it! My hair became less brittle, the smell is great, and I can honestly say that it helped keep the color in longer! Great product and I will definitely buy it again when I run out!</li>
    <li> i love this product, great for my hair</li>
    <li> A  great product and a good price.</li>
    <li> I used to spend a lot of money on shampoo and conditioner until I received a free sample of this L&#x27;Oreal shampoo and conditioner in the mail. I really didn&#x27;t expect them to be special, but I was very wrong. My hair is very fine and I have extra sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t hurt my scalp at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is nice and creamy, lathers really well, and leaves my hair feeling extra clean and shiny. I also love the smell, which is very delicate. A man could use this too, because it doesn&#x27;t smell overly feminine. The lovely delicate herb smell, is just as good the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is much less expensive than the other products I&#x27;ve been buying, and I like it more. I have two other shampoos which I also like, (I like to alternate) but this is my favorite by far.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was a great dissapointment to me.  It did not lather easily and made my hair feel dry, hard, matted and stiff. It may be sulfate free but had nothing else to offer in terms of shiny healthy looking hair.  I wish I could find one redeeming quality about this shampoo but I can&#x27;t. It&#x27;s just awful sums it up.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It smells amazing!  Keeps my dye job looking great!</li>
    <li> Safest, best product out there. Great for my colored, dry, fine hair.  My hair feels moist and now has body it never had before. The color stays in noticeably longer. I can&#x27;t go back to using sulfate containing shampoo ever again. This product rocks since it&#x27;s so much less than other sulfate free shampoos.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing shampoo! I use it with the matching conditioning masque, but even before using the conditioner, I feel the difference in my hair as I wash out the shampoo. I have thick, frizzy, wavy hair, with lots of flyaways. When I wash other shampoos out of my hair, the hair feels tangly, but when I wash this shampoo out, my hair is immediately MUCH SMOOTHER than it was before I put the shampoo on. Also, I dye my hair and this is great for keeping your color fresh and bright longer than other shampoos will leave your color. It&#x27;s more expensive than regular shampoos because it is sulfate free (protects color), but it is worth it because it works WAY better than regular shampoos. Take it from someone who&#x27;s tried a lot of brands!</li>
    <li> Love this product. It smells really fresh and it has made my hair look so much better already.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and leaves my hair so silky soft!</li>
    <li> Sulfate free and vegan!  (I&#x27;m not a vegan, but I&#x27;m glad to know that I&#x27;m not washing/conditioning my hair with any animal parts)</li>
    <li> You have to get used to  the fact that this is not sudsy but it does clean your hair and because its sulfate free it is less drying. Its a reasonable price and does not leave my hair dry.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and you will get a great lather. Sulfate-free, sure. But it left my hair dull and greasy after just a couple washes. The difference was immediately noticeable. This one will be shoved to the back of my closet for emergencies only. I wouldnt even give it away.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  My unruly hair behaves when using it, which I&#x27;ve been using since it came on the market.  And, it certainly beats the price of the &#x27;W&#x27; conditioning shampoo without sulfates.  I mean, really.... most of us folks can&#x27;t spend $100 for shampoo!</li>
    <li> Nothing magical here.  Lathers better than more sulfate free.  Smell is ok, almost a manly chemical hint not to strong but not the fresh salon scent I enjoy.  I use this as an &amp;#34;in between&amp;#34; shampoo.  Something to switch things up and remove build up from my preferred shampoo that week.</li>
    <li> I read many reviews on this product(mostly good) prior to purchasing it.  One caught my attention - the person who said he/she hates the smell of this shampoo.  Being female, it is important to me that the products I use smell good.  Regardless, I thought I should try it and see what it&#x27;s like.  How bad can rosemary and mint smell?  I use it when I cook.  Anyway, I do color my hair and that is why I purchased this product.  First of all, it smells wonderful - the scent of the herbs are not at all overpowering.  Also, because it doesn&#x27;t contain the harsh salts, the bubbles feel finer.  This to me feels like a softer and a gentler product that cleans my hair without stripping it.  I have noticed that I don&#x27;t scratch my scalp anymore because  the natural oil and moisture on my scalp aren&#x27;t stripped, not leaving my scalp dry and itchy.  In a nutshell, this geochemist prefers this product over other shampoos that contain sulfates and sulfides ... so, knock yourself out.</li>
    <li> Smells great, rinses clean.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product but wanted to give a less expensive sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner a try.  I have color-treated medium wavy hair, and I absolutely love this shampoo.  It was very thick and luxurious, a little goes a long way, and it got my hair super clean without drying it out.  The conditioner was great, too.  My sister-in-law thinks these products are too heavy and weigh her hair down, but for my type of wavy (read \\&quot;frizzy\\&quot; in the summer), it&#x27;s perfect.  Loved the fragrance, too.</li>
    <li> Have switched over to this shampoo and conditioner and am very pleased with both the texture and appearance of my hair.</li>
    <li> I like the product and I like the smell.  What I don&#x27;t like it the price and the packaging.  I can only buy it when I have a coupon.  I have long hair and this lasted onl 3 weeks for me.  It costs way too much for such a small amount.</li>
    <li> This is a great sulfate free shampoo for those who get the Keratin treatments and also love a lathery shampoo.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s rare I write a product review but this stuff is so good, I felt compelled to let others know. I have PCOS and as a result my once healthy and shiny hair is brittle, fragile, and frizzy.  After using Nioxin shampoo, biotin shampoo, and other treatments for hair loss, nothing was stopping the fall out or the breakage.  Not to mention that I also dye my hair regularly and it contributes to the damage.  I then heard about \\&quot;sulfate\\&quot; free shampoos about a year ago and decided to try this particular brand because it was on sale. In one year my hair has gone from thinning and brittle, to shiny, full and bouncy. It has transformed my hair to it&#x27;s pre-PCOS state, or at least very close to it.  I noticed a very big difference after the first use.  And because my hair now has a slight wave, I also tried the Evercurl system.. not good.  This one works way better.  I&#x27;ve just bought the Aveeno renewal shampoo which was on sale and also sulfate free.  Although I&#x27;m hesitant to try something different, I will go ahead and try it and post my review.  But this is really good stuff.  Try it!</li>
    <li> I use this along with the Moisturizing conditioner. I like this shampoo a lot better than the volumizing EverPure, it seems to make my hair feel cleaner and lighter.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like its smell.</li>
    <li> Take good care of your hair or it will become a spider&#x27;s lair.</li>
    <li> Really great Shampoo and Conditioner.  I have tried several different sulfate free and this one works the best for me.  The first time I tried it, my hair was fuller and healthier.  I am 50 and my hair is growing out gracefully.  I can so feel the difference.  I have been using for a month now and I am so happy I purchased this stuff.  Unreal....</li>
    <li> Stripped red color from half of my hair on first wash. I would not recommend this for people who dye their hair red.</li>
    <li> This brand is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used on my hair. I have long straight hair, and I can never find a shampoo that works for it. I have literally tried everything from the cheapest Suave to expensive Paul Mitchell and nothing worked as well as this brand. I wash my hair daily and this shampoo leaves my hair soft and looking like a supermodel&#x27;s hairstyle. HOWEVER, this shampoo unfortunately breaks out my skin quite badly. I have PCOS so I am prone to breakouts, but this has made my skin much worse so I will have to discontinue using it :( If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin like me, I would HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
    <li> Wish I could give this zero stars as it fails to do the main thing its marketing claims to do. I have been dying my hair for 25 years and have been red now for the last 5 or so.  I have never had the trouble with fading as much as since I used this product. It is a bit of a problem for reds but when I started using this I just saw red water pouring out after every wash despite using cold water. It was still just as bad after 4 washes.  I never had this happen to this extent even when using shampoo with sulfates.  To top it all,  it literally stinks. The smell is really unpleasant and I think even if it didn&#x27;t seem to strip colour out rather than save it, I don&#x27;t think I would buy it again for that reason. Other sulfates free brands appearing lately - I will be throwing this away and trying those instead.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo &amp; the conditioner twice already (just got out of the shower not too long ago). I&#x27;m not so sure that this stuff does what it says and keeps hair color on longer. It definitely feels cleaner than when I have used other sulfate free shampoo&#x27;s which basically feel like i&#x27;m putting lotion in my hair and it feels oily and gross after &amp;#34;washing&amp;#34;. But even using this stuff the red just pours out of my hair. I dye my hair monthly with the L&#x27;Oreal Feria Power Red dye and it fries my hair. So it makes me mad when the stuff I use to wash my hair makes it fall out so quickly. I don&#x27;t think I can handle dying it more than once a month. It does smell amazing though, and leaves my hair feeling clean. So there&#x27;s that. But my main concern was finding a shampoo &amp; conditioner that didn&#x27;t strip the color out of my hair. Not so sure this is it just yet.</li>
    <li> Love this!  I color my hair and this product does not strip my color.  I&#x27;ve used many shampoos, including some very pricy, high end shampoos, but this one has yielded the best results for a very good price.</li>
    <li> I wash my dyed red hair in cold water and this does seem to help the color last longer. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell but it&#x27;s worth it for the price</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright. I don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!  Easy for travel also.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for over a year now and I love it.  I chose it because it is sulfate free but keep using it because it is gentle on my color treated hair and I LOVE the way it leaves my hair shining, smelling great and so healthy.</li>
    <li> Prior to using this shampoo my husband and I both had very healthy hair and scalps - no sores and no hair loss.  At first we liked the product but then after a few weeks we both noticed dry patches which turned to sore spots and then noticed our hair definitely thinning.  I don&#x27;t know what is in this product, but since we stopped using it our scalp and hair is returning to normal.</li>
    <li> Helps keep my color true.  I have thin hair that fades with cheap &amp;#34;colored hair&amp;#34; shampoo and conditioner.  It doesn&#x27;t have sulphate, which makes my color fade to blahhhh!</li>
    <li> I have purchased nearly all the different shampoos from this line and they are all great. I color my hair and this is the  only product I have found that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune that doesn&#x27;t strip my  out. Its a gentle clean. I love the smell too. I spent about an hour one day in my local Cvs reading ingredient labels on all the different shampoos because I like to switch it up, but nothing compared to this product that was anywhere near the price point. I have since become a &#x27;if its not broken dont fix it&#x27; thinker about this product and have been using it about 3 years.</li>
    <li> Love this L&#x27;Oreal sulfate-free series, could see obvious change with my hair. Much stronger compared with before. Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this. The smell is divine and the first tube of this worked just fine. Afterwards, it didn&#x27;t seem to work as well and feels like it actually started drying my hair out. I have color treated, long hair with mostly lowlights and some highlights. I have thick, wavy hair. I bought this trying to replicate the Pureology from my salon which is about $25/tube compared to Loreal&#x27;s $6/tube.</li>
    <li> very good to maintain color. muy bueno para mantener el color del pelo y deja el cabello suave i like</li>
    <li> Love it. The only shampoo that I use now for my colored hair. Works well.</li>
    <li> The only product that my family uses.  We must be sensitive to sulfates as this doesn&#x27;t leave little bumps on our scalp even after using for more than a year.  No flakes either.</li>
    <li> Omg! I came across these reviews after searching for everpure causing hair loss, and thank god I found them because I couldn&#x27;t find anything else online. I am 26 and have been using this shampoo for about 4 months now. I usually wear my hair in a poof and have had to completely stop as you can see 2 to 3 inches of my scalp through my thinning hair. I had my thyroid tested- came back normal. Changed my medication, started taking iron and hair skin and nail vitamins religiously, and believe it or not, the hair loss is getting worse! I have NO history of baldness on either side of my family and have not been under stress or a change of diet. It takes me 4 minutes to dry my hair, which is down to my lower back. 6 months ago, it took me half an hour- in intervals. It HAS to be the shampoo. I will stop using immediately and I really hope it works.</li>
    <li> A bad rating from Environmental Working Group has led me to find a new shampoo. One star for effectiveness and lovely smell. Minus four for having harmful ingredients. Endocrin disruption, anyone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OXYBENZONE&lt;br /&gt;BENZOPHENONE 3 Enhanced skin absorption, Biochemical or cellular level changes, Developmental/reproductive toxicity, Endocrine disruption, Allergies/immunotoxicity, Organ system toxicity (non-reproductive), Persistence and bioaccumulation, Use restrictions</li>
    <li> I have tried several different shampoos over the last two years to help manage my wavy, frizzy hair, including Wen, Super Skinny, and Frizz Ease. I did not like the greasy, heavy feeling of the first two and did not find Frizz Ease very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo makes my hair feel clean, not greasy and heavy, and does an excellent job of reducing the frizz! I alternate between the SMOOTH SHAMPOO and the MOISTURE SHAMPOO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen some reviews complaining about the pine scent. I have no problem with the scent but if you do, stick with the MOISTURE SHAMPOO. The scent is milder.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair nice &amp; soft, but it smells strongly of old lady perfume. It was so strong, I was debating washing my hair again with my old shampoo &amp; conditioner right after I got out of the shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m reading a lot of bad reviews which is funny... most people don&#x27;t realize it takes up to 6mo for hair to return to natural. The harsh chemicals in most other shampoos destroy hair. After you stop using them your hair WILL be greasy, dandruff worse, and sometimes hair loss. Also they use sodium lauryl sulfoacetate which tends to foam ALOT and have a thicker foam. It&#x27;s a detergent just like sodium sulfates are they are used to make the shampoo foam up, however it may sound the same but it&#x27;s a lot more natural and derived from coconut oil. I was so happy when this product came out because I went months workout washing my hair except with the baking soda/ vinegar thing but I got sick of how long it took. My hair was so greasy after though and then one day my scalp stopped is over compensating oil production and I had great hair. Then I went back to Pantene. And now I&#x27;m starting all over with this product. My hair is yet again greasy but I know it&#x27;ll pass. The reason for this is because when you use harsh chemicals that dry your hair out, your body produces 10x more oil you just don&#x27;t notice because you keep washing/drying it out. Get past that hurdle and you&#x27;ll have amazing hair! Not one thing used in this product is harmful it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to &amp;#34;no shampoo&amp;#34; methods for anyone who doesn&#x27;t have the time or energy to figure out that method. I used this line to ease my hair through adjusting away from heavy chemical products to Shea Moisture products, but I moved to a drier climate and my hair frizzed out. So I came back to the EverPure line and it&#x27;s awesome!&lt;br /&gt;There is a transition period if you&#x27;ve been using crappy chemicals where your hair will be greasier much more quickly than usual. For me it took about a month, and if you use a chemical shampoo again (like having a stylist wash and cut it at a salon) you can expect to re-acclimate, but it re-balances more quickly. The payoff is that I only wash my hair maybe every 4-5 days because it does not get gross and greasy! My hair is very thick and very long, almost to my butt. Styling is time consuming! Keeping my hair healthy saves a lot of time and money. My hair stylist, who has done my hair for 13 years now, comments on how healthy my hair is. And I blow dry, and heat style it regularly.</li>
    <li> Thank you, L&#x27;Oreal for having an excellent shampoo that is cruelty free and sulfate free! Although L&#x27;Oreal is not a cruelty free company, their EverPure line is vegan and not tested on animals. I found out about it when I was researching shampoos that are not tested on animals. You never know when you find a list of recommended products if you are going to like them, but I was very happy with this one. Since I&#x27;ve been using it, my hair has been shinier and softer.</li>
    <li> Only brand of shampoo I have found that doesn&#x27;t strip my color. I alternate between this and the Everpure Volume shampoo.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product since it was much more affordable than most other sulfate free products. Now I regret that decision. It has left me with dry, breaking hair that seems like it is coming out far too easily. Also, I noticed the itchy scalp patches that other reviewers mentioned. I&#x27;ve never had problems with this before. Unfortunately, I got a Keratin treatment right before I started using this and it has made the treatment fade much quicker than it was supposed to.</li>
    <li> Have Loved this brand &amp; type for Years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the 1st time I thought to buy it from Amazon (glad I did Way better price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again!  :)</li>
    <li> I bought this after I dyed the underside of my hair pink.  It made my color fade incredibly fast, it smells awful, and made my hair SO itchy.</li>
    <li> I use this without the conditioner and it makes my totally gray hair soft and thick feeling. Compare to WEN.</li>
    <li> This is very nice shampoo - I use it about every 2-3 days to keep my hair free of all those crazy styling products that I use.  My hair feels thicker and it seems to be shiny as well  I have less hair loss as well although I have stopped washing my hair every day as well.  I have been using this for about 6 months.  Going to try the conditioner too.</li>
    <li> I used this before 2-3 times when I was&lt;br /&gt;buying hair color.This does protect the&lt;br /&gt;color of your hair. It really last longer-&lt;br /&gt;gives moisture when you need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T. M.</li>
    <li> Have used L&#x27;Oreal EverStrong &amp; EverPure products for years - like that they are sulfate-free.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this shampoo! Works well for my colored hair.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. I think it keeps my color stronger longer and doesn&#x27;t fade it as quickly as other shampoos.</li>
    <li> This product is simply perfect, keeping my red hair, red! :-)&lt;br /&gt;I always felt comfortable with L&#x27;Oreal products, and this one makes me feel my hair perfect, soft, manageable and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it frequently without problems.&lt;br /&gt;The store was a great dealer with fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend!</li>
    <li> On one hand, it made my hair very soft and I paired it with the conditioner that goes with this.  However after 2 weeks of using it, my hair became flatter.  What I mean by this is the hair sits closer to my scalp now as opposed to it being fluffier (if that makes any sense).  It also feels like my hair is weighed down.  Now I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just this shampoo or if this is how all sulfate free shampoos are supposed to make your hair feel since I haven&#x27;t tried any others but I preferred the way my hair looked when I was using shampoos with sulfates in them.  I don&#x27;t use any styling products but yet it feels like there&#x27;s a build up from using this and the conditioner together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to give it a bit more time before throwing in the towel and might try other brands just to compare but at this point I&#x27;m not so sure if I will be repurchasing it due to the reasons I stated above.</li>
    <li> This left a film on my hair that made it feel super gross and weighed down. Plus, the conditioner that goes with this smells very strongly of roses and the scent doesn&#x27;t go away.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal is one of my favorite brands because I believe they have taken consumer concerns seriously. I try as much as possible to purchase products without the harmful chemicals and additives such as sodium laurel sulfate. Since I&#x27;ve been using this product my hair is healthier. It has more body and shine with much less thinning and breakage. Thank you L&#x27;Oreal. And thank you Amazon for making this product available for such a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel harsh on my hair but I am concerned with its latheriness. It contains sodium lauryl sulfoacetate which is different from sodium lauryl sulfate. It doesn&#x27;t appear to be a sulfate like the latter and is not toxic, according to the EPA; hence, the sulfate-free label.&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned with others&#x27; experience with hair loss.  So far, I haven&#x27;t had any experience out of the ordinary with that. I tend to lose a few hairs in the shower and washing with this was normal. I will update if I do experience anything troubling.&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like is that I normally like to use moroccan oil on my damp hair and it doesn&#x27;t look too good on it now when my hair dries. This shampoo is the only new product I&#x27;m using so I think this is the culprit.</li>
    <li> Bought this product, and I hated it. It made my hair feel greasy and dirty. It weighed it down to where it looked like I didn&#x27;t take a shower in days. I also broke out from it, I&#x27;ve been having that problem with all sulfate-free shampoos, none of them have worked. Haven&#x27;t found a good sulfate free product yet.</li>
    <li> What a great product.  I have been a fan but this is the best ever.  Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and so happy to have found a good deal for it.  It can be a bit pricey in stores but this is a great product.  It&#x27;s so lush and moisturizing and smells great.  I feel like it definitely helps my color last longer!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo because I recently colored my hair and dont have a ton of money to spend on better shampoos.  Next time it will be worth it to throw in a couple of extra dollars.  This shampoo does not work good, its very heavy on my hair and its smells disgusting, similiar to dog shampoo.  I will never buy it again.  The smell literally gives me a headache.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I needed a sulfate free / color safe shampoo since I just went from blonde to red. I came across this and figured I would give it a shot since it was pretty inexpensive. My hair feels clean and soft after use but it doesnt smell clean or fresh after use. The smell takes a bit of getting used to. It&#x27;s not exactly a bad smell....but it&#x27;s not good either. Very hard to explain but it&#x27;s growing on me. If your main goal is to have pretty smelling hair dont buy this...I dont think you&#x27;ll be getting any compliments on how good your hair smells.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why people have such horrible stories with this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and every time I try to switch and try something new (I like to try new products and see what&#x27;s out there, not because it&#x27;s not good), I go right back to this. I have fine naturally curly hair but I always wear it straight. It smells good, actually cleans the hair, leaves it soft, but most importantly, it lathers. I can&#x27;t stand shampoos that don&#x27;t lather, makes it feel like it&#x27;s not getting everything out. Overall really great product</li>
    <li> Found cheaper at store.</li>
    <li> always have an extra on hand. I really like this shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells terrible and does not work. It smells great and works when bought elsewhere. Read between the lines otherwise my review will be removed again.</li>
    <li> I Really like this....L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverPure Moisture Shampoo, 8.5-Fluid Ounce as good as Reiken with out the crazy high price.</li>
    <li> left my hair feeling dirty, EXTREMELY dry, like straw, and crazy frizzy. not just this set of shampoo, but all of them including evercurl and  eversleek did this to my hair. waste of money.</li>
    <li> Love this for my hair! Protects the color so well! And my hair is so heathy from using!</li>
    <li> leaves my hair soft and smooth! Great for color treated hair.</li>
    <li> Update to my original review:&lt;br /&gt;I am adding to my original review of this product after reading so many reviews regarding the validity of it being sulfate free.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Sodium laureth sulfate&amp;#34; is the main culprit in sulfate shampoos. This product contains &amp;#34;sodium lauryl sulfoacetate&amp;#34; which is not the same. It is actually a substitute for the sulfate component in shampoos. They are different compounds.  CH3(CH2)11(OCH2CH2)nOSO3Na  vs.  C14H27NaO5S.  The other ingredients listed such as sodium cocyl isethionate, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, etc. are also not sulfate. Again, they are different chemical compounds. Although they sound alike, they are not sulfate. This is a key difference is what makes these shampoos better for your hair. Alternative chemical compounds. Now this does not mean &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;....they are still chemical compounds. But they are certainly sulfate-free shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;Pureology shampoo is one of the best known sulfate-free shampoos (and way more expensive), and their ingredients are the exact same.&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this exact shampoo for the past 5 years and can&#x27;t imagine using anything else. I have been dying my hair for over 10+ years and have used most every shampoo for color-treated hair. When I first started using sulfate-free shampoo for my color treated hair I didn&#x27;t like that the only products available were high end and $$$ (ex: Pureology). Although there are more sulfate-free products available at more reasonable prices, I still think this is the best product. The price can&#x27;t be beat, the scent of Rosemary-mint is amazing, the shampoo lathers so well that I don&#x27;t run out of shampoo so quickly with my long hair, my hair is soft, and my color stays longer. Do not look any further!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Ya conocía pues lo he utilizado en el pasado. Este producto así que lo recomiendo. Ademas, el precio es bastante económico</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for almost one year. I thought it worked well for the price...until my hair started falling out in huge clumps in the shower. I have had lab work done. Physically I am fine...just going bald. No one can tell...yet. [[ASIN:B001P1ZELS L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverPure Moisture Shampoo, 8.5-Fluid Ounce]]</li>
    <li> I am at the point of desperation with my hair since most of the time it feels like straw. This is the result of coloring my hair recently. For some reason my hair is not bouncing back. It is very damaged and I looked all over amazon to find a good product that would tame my hair. This shampoo is especially made for colored hair and it seems very moisturizing. I only need to shampoo my hair once since it cleans so thourally. People say this shampoo makes their hair fall out but I haven&#x27;t found that to be the case yet. I guess I&#x27;m willing to try anything and this seems to work for me at the moment. Probably most shampoos cause hair loss in some way so you pick your battles. I just haven&#x27;t found any natural shampoos to deal with overly processed hair. So I am happy with this for now. When I use this shampoo my hair seems to relax. I use this with the smooth conditioner, which actually works better than the hair mask by this same company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> I use the whole set and my color can stay on my head longer than usual.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. Always leave my hair feeling smooth!</li>
    <li> People tell me how good I smell. :)</li>
    <li> This is a great clean shampoo without all the sulfates. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my curly hair, and I like the scent.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo/conditioner.  It smells so good and it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out or make it oily.  Really, you can&#x27;t beat the price, either, especially compared to the majority of color-safe, sulfate-free products.</li>
    <li> Great lather and fragrance.  I have already ordered more and hope to continue using it. I also like that it is one of the add on itrms.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few months - trying to see if I could normalize to it. It did not get any better. It started with itching...constant itch and dryness. I then started to see the flaky sore patches. I&#x27;ve since stopped and gone to a different shampoo, and my scalp feels great now. Terrible product.</li>
    <li> I started using this shampoo 2 months ago. Within a week, my hair started falling while taking shower, brushing, and even in a normal situation. My scalp itches so badly. The hair fall was too much that I was getting worried for a serious health issue. This was my first sulfate free shampoo, so I don&#x27;t have experience with the other ones. I&#x27;ll give a shot to an9ther brand.</li>
    <li> I THOUGHT I had ordered the conditioner, which I REALLY like. I was surprised when the shampoo came in but was willing to give it a try.  I&#x27;ve used it now for a few weeks and I don&#x27;t like it as much as my other shampoos.  My hair feels grimy (that&#x27;s not the right word, but close) after shampooing with this and my hair feels and acts like it does when I haven&#x27;t shampooed in several days.  The shampoo is not for me or my hair so I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo for my long and colored hair. It takes care of my color at the time that leaves my hair moisture. The smell is really good and you can feel the cleannes instead of is a sulfate fre, that for me is a plus since I am looking for more natural and junk free products.</li>
    <li> I only used this shampoo once and my hair started falling out in large clumps in the shower. I read other reviews on here and they said the same thing. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Scalp is not clean and itchy when using this. Plus huge chunks of hair falls out in shower and on comb! Never again!</li>
    <li> priced better than walmart...great product</li>
    <li> I have long straight hair and I love to pamper my hair. My hair is my thing. Anyway, I have spent tons of money on salon brand shampoos, up to $25 a bottle. My girlfriend who is a hair stylist told me to try this shampoo and I was skeptical. I used it and after the first shampoo and wash I could see a difference. My hair feels so smooth and looks so silky. It smells great and it is so affordable! My wallet and my hair are so happy!</li>
    <li> This shampoo weighed down my hair and it felt greasy within a few hours after shampooing. It also lathered way too much for a sulfate-free shampoo. It just doesn&#x27;t feel similar with other sulfate-free shampoos and that makes me a bit suspicious, like you don&#x27;t get the same clean feeling after shampooing and styling. The worst of all was the hair loss after washing, big bunches of hair came off. The first time I thought it was a coincidence but it happened all 3 times I used it, and after I stopped using it my hair went back to normal. Perhaps it works better on thick/dry hair, it just didn&#x27;t work for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. My hair feels better since I started going sulfate free. I highly recommend it. They have other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; in this line and and I think I have tried them all, but this one works best for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo thinking, since it was supposed to be sulfate-free, that it would work just as well as a professional brand I&#x27;ve been using for several years. I&#x27;ve been using the EverPure product going on two months now and it is ruining my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair does not ever feel completely clean, and by the morning following a shampoo, my hair is greasy and limp and looks like I haven&#x27;t washed it in a week. This surprised me because my hair had been feeling dry. So I dismissed the grease at first, because I thought that it was better explained by a spell of hot weather but now that the hot weather is totally gone, the only other explanation is that this has something to do with the shampoo. My scalp has gotten to be very itchy since I started using this product - again, I dismissed it as being caused by heat - and it now has little bumps all over it. I noticed that I did not experience the greasiness or the itchiness when I made a short weekend trip and had to use the hotel shampoo, which leads me to believe that these problems (which have returned) are due to the EverPure product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also noticed that my hair has begun \\&quot;shedding\\&quot; far more than normal... to the point that the amount I clip in a barrette or ponytail is noticeably much less. I do not know if there is a way to definitively say that this is being caused by this particular shampoo, but I will say that I haven&#x27;t experienced any unusual stressors as of late, nor has my diet changed and I am not protein-deficient or having thyroid problems. And, I know that my hair was not falling out in this alarming way BEFORE I started using EverPure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve thrown this out and will never take a chance on this product again. I feel stupid for falling for what is obviously a bit of greenwashing. :(</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo alright, probably will not purchase again due to the smell of it. I like vanillaish sweet scents more.</li>
    <li> I first bought this brand of shampoo and conditioner because I&#x27;ve been getting my hair colored at a \\&quot;green\\&quot; salon. They use no harsh chemicals or dyes in their hair care products, and they inspired me to switch my shampoo and conditioner to a sulfate-free, paraben-free type. At first I loved it, but over time (a period of a few months) it dried my hair out considerably. My hair just felt dry, unmanageable, weighed down, etc. On top of it all, my boyfriend told me he HATED the smell of it, it made him sick to his stomach. That was the final straw for me, I&#x27;m back to my regular shampoo and conditioner, and my hair smells and looks better than it ever did when I was using this stuff.</li>
    <li> The only kind of shampoo and conditioner I will buy.  This stuff works well for me.  I used to break out on my scalp when I used certain shampoos that contained sulfates.  Now I don&#x27;t break out and my hair color lasts a lot longer.</li>
    <li> I like all al it except for the smell.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic shampoo! I have never found a sulfate-free shampoo that can lather like this one. And it is so moisturizing!  It doesn&#x27;t fade my hair color at all. I also really love the conditioner even though I don&#x27;t have to use much because this shampoo makes my hair so soft and reduces the frizz a lot.I think this is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I was curious about sulfate free shampoo, so I tried L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s \\&quot;sulfate free\\&quot; shampoo.  Of all the different shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, this one was the worst.  It left my hair feeling like dry straw.  I always condition my hair after shampooing, but I felt like I needed to deep condition every time, just to get my hair to a workable point.  No matter how much conditioner I used, how many times I conditioned, or how long I left the conditioner on my hair (using my normal conditioner, not EverPure), my hair remained very dry and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked forward to a decrease in the seborrheic dermatitis that has worsened over time.  Unfortunately, my scalp has never itched more.  I made it through the bottle, but I wish I had just cut my losses and thrown it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you purchase this product, review the ingredients, and do a search for any of the second through fifth ingredients:  Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate.  It would be bad enough if one of these ingredients were in the shampoo ... the combination is unnerving.  This confirmed why the product performed so terribly.  And, frankly, makes me wonder how L&#x27;Oreal can get away with advertising the product as sulfate free.</li>
    <li> So surprised to find that this smells sooo good! Just dyed my hair red and since red fades quickly I plan to always use this. Love how it is sulfate free!</li>
    <li> The product so far is very nice. Arrived spilled all over other items in the box. I recommend the warehouse adding tape to the cover.</li>
    <li> Hi there, I have been using this shampoo for about 6 weeks or so.  I noticed prob about a month ago that large clumps of my hair were coming out in the shower.  I kept thinking that maybe it would stop falling out, but it has only gotten worse! I am noticing that my hair is much thinner when i put it up, and it is noticeable on the sides.  I am 28, and I went and looked at some pictures of myself from a year ago and my hair looked fairly thick and normal, I just cant imagine that my hair fallig out in huge clumps like this all of a sudden could be genetic hair loss.  I also noticed my hair is very greasy and weighed down, it is not fluffy at all, which makes the hair loss look even worse! I am hopeful that if i change shampoos my hair will stop falling out after reading these other reviews and seeing other ppl had the same issue.</li>
    <li> this makes your hair feel clean and conditioned</li>
    <li> I choose this color care shampoo bcause I have bleached color treated hair and it worked perfectly well, the color stayed longer and its very mild, I love it and I would recommend it to a friend</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo - it smells so good (never had a shampoo that smelled like rosemary!), and is good for dyed hair b/c it&#x27;s sulfate-free.  My girlfriends all raved about how good it smelled too.  :)</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this shampoo.  I don&#x27;t even color my hair but I use this for the smell!</li>
    <li> Though a little expensive, I love this shampoo and conditioner. The scent is very pleasing and everyone says my hair looks better since I have been using it. I bought the set for my mother for Christmas. I hope she likes it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> A very rich shampoo, makes a lot of foam and you need less quantity than other shampoos.</li>
    <li> love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love it that this shampoo is sulfate -free.  It is an excellent shampoo for fine, straight hair.</li>
    <li> I was not too sure when I ordered but I&#x27;m very happy with the shampoo.  It is light and one wash is enough.</li>
    <li> I was going to return it due to I mistakenly ordered it instead of the conditioner and decided to keep it. its great shampoo, all you need is a dab. my hair is like long and i put a dab on my hand like fill the palm in the middle and that was good for my whole hair.&lt;br /&gt;my hair felt soft in the shower and out the shower when wet and when dry. so this stuff is good. Protects color as well my color did not wash out after rinse. Enjoy and its smells really nice.</li>
    <li> I am a budget shopper and find it ridiculous to pay more than a couple of dollar for a bottle of shampoo but L’Oreal EverPure Moisture Shampoo has changed my shopping habits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This line of shampoo and associated products are 100% sulfate-free, which helps to extend the life of your hair color and makes the products gentle on your hair.  It is also salt free.  These two ingredients are common in other hair products and are one of the main reasons why your hair color fades and washes away.  With L’Oreal EverPure, you don&#x27;t have to worry about this.  Your hair color is protected!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like best about the product is the luxurious lather.  I am talking a salon quality experience!  The shampoo is thick and lush and produces the same type of lather - thick, lush, foamy, and luxurious!  I am also hooked on the scent - it contains hints of rosemary and juniper but is not at all overpowering or offensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who are social conscious, L’Oreal EverPure is 100% vegan and its cleaning ingredients are all naturally derived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product isn’t cheap but compared to salon products it is a steal!</li>
    <li> I used to have a sleek, fine hair, but since I started to tint it, my hair become frizzy and mat. Thanks to this shampoo, it is softer and sleeker than before.</li>
    <li> Shampoo can be such an individual thing.  Everyone&#x27;s hair is different.  I happen to love this shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why I love this shampoo:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The pleasant smell.  The light scent stays on my hair all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It preserves my color.  My hair is highlighted and it stays looking good for several months if I use this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It is just as effective as the expensive salon shampoos.  I&#x27;ll admit it; I&#x27;ve fallen prey to buying the $50.00 bottle of shampoo at the salon.  Sure it worked, but so does L&#x27;Oreal. And L&#x27;Oreal is almost 1/10 the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one small downside is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to clean my hair as thoroughly as sulfate-based shampoos.  This isn&#x27;t just a L&#x27;Oreal thing though; I&#x27;ve found this to be the case with any sulfate-free shampoo.  It&#x27;s a trade-off between preserving one&#x27;s hair color and having one&#x27;s hair squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for my color-treated hair for a little over two years now, and it&#x27;s been...OK. Not great, not perfect, just OK. My biggest complaint is that the smell of rosemary and mint starts to get old after awhile, and frankly, it grosses me out now. Not a fan of the scent and not a fan of the product...I&#x27;m switching to something a little bit kinder to my hair.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair product ever!</li>
    <li> Love how it controls my hair.</li>
    <li> Leaves her feeling light and smooth</li>
    <li> I have not fine, not thick but in between dry hair, but my scalp is not dry at all.  I am very happy with the L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverPure Moisture Shampoo, it makes my hair really soft and smooth. I can go without shampooing for 2-3 days. It does lather a lot, so I use very little. It smells great and does not cause any dandruff. I also use the conditioner of the same brand.</li>
    <li> I had tried other sulfate free shampoos at a much higher price and did not feel my hair was thoroughly clean. Since my hair is thin and color treated, I decided to try Loreal&#x27;s Sulfate Free version. Suds! It actually lathers and covers every strand. My hair feels and smells so clean with this shampoo and conditioner. In addition, my blonde tresses are no longer becoming brassy looking between colorings, as was typically the case with other shampoos. I&#x27;ve been using the product for two weeks and after blowing it dry yesterday, I really noticed a difference. Without using any other products or leave-in conditioners, my hair had a healthy shine and the ends that usually look frayed after blow drying causing me to need layers of other products, appeared very smooth. I love the Rosemary Juniper scent that lingers into the next day. I think I&#x27;ve finally found right shampoo and conditioner that is gentle on my fragile hair, but also leaves it clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> I only used this one day (along with the conditioner).  It worked just okay.  But the smell was Horrible!  I can&#x27;t get passed the smell so I can&#x27;t possibly use it again. I am trying to find a good sulfate free shampoo that is affordable.  So far that request is an oxymoron.  It&#x27;s a 10 works great, but is expensive.  I think next I will try DermOrganic.</li>
    <li> This is the only brand of shampoo I have used for my hair over the last year or so, since I do color my hair and find my hair and scalp getting drier as I age. This is a good price, and I appreciate not to have to hunt around the local stores to find it on sale. I do find it is gentle on my color, and keeps the color truer and longer.  I find the tube design easy to stand up on the shower shelf and to take along with me when traveling.  The one negative for me is just like body lotion or toothpaste, it can be hard to get the remaining small amount out of the tube when it&#x27;s almost gone, but I guess any product design has that issue. The shampoo is thicker in consistency than most, not runny and fluid.  I use it for the health of my hair and scalp, and to be gentle on my color. I massage my gently rub my scalp with it as I shampoo. I shampoo 2-3 times per week, and once a week I use a conditioner.</li>
    <li> A good to shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
