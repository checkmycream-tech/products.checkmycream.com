      <li>this was the absolute best clip I ever found.  </li>

      <li>So glad I ran across these.    </li>
      <li>i will definately buy more.</li>
      <li>She says that the best thing that can be done with this product is to have it placed back on store shelves so that the customer can pick and choose and not have to go to the bother of mail order.</li>
      <li>One was really more like copper color than the tortoise shell pictured.</li>
      <li>I love these clips and had a time finding them.</li>
      <li>however, but after using them for a while, i think the size is actually better than what i had.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with them.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and most clips</li>
      <li>It may work fine for shoulder length hair, but not for longer or thicker hair.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair</li>
      <li>I have baby fine hair that is thinning with age.  </li>
      <li>but they work fine.  </li>
      <li>So, for all you gals with fine hair, the Erin Claw Clips will hold your hair.  </li>
      <li>A great Clip, not big and bulky.</li>
      <li>I have SUPER FINE (like baby fine), super straight, mid-back length, very healthy, brown hair.  </li>
      <li>Mine was a more solid, metallic kind of brown.</li>
      <li>Wish they had more colors, especially a clear or frosted</li>
      <li>, the tortoiseshell looks better in my dark hair good size to use when you don&#x27;t want all your hair up.  </li>
      <li>I love these clips and they are hard to find - perfect for medium (not long) fine hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a shame, as from the side they are very pretty.  </li>
      <li>I have fine, thick hair, and they never slide out like most of the others I&#x27;ve tried and own.  </li>
      <li>Do not waste your money on these, found cheaper and better quality on another site.</li>
      <li>Love these, they hold my fine hair all day long and never give me a headache.</li>
      <li>These are just the right size.  </li>
      <li>the right way&amp;#34</li>
      <li>These clips are nice but not for long hair.</li>
      <li>Holds in your hair great and does not slip out, even with thick hair</li>
      <li>These clips are exactly what I was hoping them to be.</li>
      <li>These weren&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>They work well the first time and take almost no getting used to.  </li>
      <li>Another reason to love Amazon even more!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am buying ten packages, just in case Amazon runs out!!</li>
      <li>I plan on ordering several more packages.</li>
      <li>Love the design but had to return because they could not possibly be used for my braided  hair.</li>
      <li>These are light plastic and although prone to breakage after frequent use, they are still my favorite style to use for daily twisting hair off my face.</li>
      <li>The price was a bit high, but if they worked, it would be worth it.  </li>
      <li>I thought these would be the large clips.</li>
      <li>Would be great but spring is weak and wimpy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This will be great if you have thin hair.</li>
      <li>Did not hold my hair very well.</li>
      <li>The clips that I received were the same shape as those in the picture, and kind of the same color, but had a glittery shimmer.</li>
      <li>Banana Clips don&#x27;t stay in my hair and neither do the other cute hair clips,</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a lot flatter than a normal clip!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used clips like these for a few years now and was so happy to find them available on here after coming up empty in local stores.  </li>
      <li>They are a little smaller than I thought, but I love them!</li>
      <li>The hold my long hair in place when I twist it into a small bun and are more flat than most clips and so make it easier to rest my head when driving or sitting.</li>
      <li>Much nicer clip for same price</li>
      <li>because my hair is so soft, everything just falls out.  </li>
      <li>They are so easy to use, and I don&#x27;t have to constantly take my hair down and try to get them &amp;#34;in</li>
      <li>when i first got them  they looked the same size as what i had, but when i arrived they were smaller.  </li>
      <li>my active lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product function is worth five stars</li>
      <li>These clips are made of a hard rubber like plastic, so they don&#x27;t crack or break easily.</li>
      <li>They look like a bear claw clip in the picture, but the bottom clip is not actually flat, like it appears.</li>
      <li>The description of this product showed them as large but they only a little bigger than half of the large claw.</li>

<li> These claw clips do not stick out on the back of your head but lie flat.  </li>
<li> Also like that they lie flat</li>
<li> They sit flat and aren&#x27;t a nuisance when driving the car - not hitting the head rest etc.</li>
<li> too bad my dog liked too need to order another</li>
<li> i had very old clips like these and was not able to find them in any store.  </li>
<li> But for the 20 years I had very long hair</li>
<li> I gave her the black, shes blonde</li>
<li> Not what I expected.</li>
<li> I was down to one clip after teeth on the other one broke off.  </li>
<li> so you just need to be a little careful.  </li>
<li> one black and the other a sold bronze color.</li>
<li> I have long, thin hair and this clip doesn&#x27;t hold my hair back at all.  </li>
<li> So it&#x27;s either pony-tail or down.  </li>
<li> My wife was complaining that her previous clips broke, and I turned to Amazon for the answer.  </li>
<li> In case it matters to anyone, rather than the faux-tortoise clip pictured under the black one, I got a copper-colored clip.</li>
<li> I wear those when I don&#x27;t expect to have to see other people, but don&#x27;t appreciate that an option isn&#x27;t given for color or at least a warning in the ad that color can be expected to be inconsistent.</li>
<li> Would not recommend for long or thick hair</li>
<li> They are small.</li>
<li> Was not sure they would stay in my hair</li>
<li> Goody must have discontinued this style of hair clip, because I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding them.</li>
<li> I searched everywhere for side clips, hard to find.</li>
<li> This did not work for me as my hair is too thick and the clip couldn&#x27;t hold it.&lt;br</li>
<li> This clip is designed so that the hinge shows from the front which is not very attractive.  </li>
<li> It is hard to find these types in the stores and they don&#x27;t crimp my haor as badly as some others.</li>
<li> I purchased several sets of these and some are as pictured while others are a horrible pearlescent color.</li>
<li> Sad because they are well made.</li>
<li> Disappointed..</li>

    <li> Goody must have discontinued this style of hair clip, because I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding them. So glad I ran across these.    In case it matters to anyone, rather than the faux-tortoise clip pictured under the black one, I got a copper-colored clip. Don&#x27;t know whether that was just the luck of the draw or they only have black/copper sets.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used clips like these for a few years now and was so happy to find them available on here after coming up empty in local stores.  I was down to one clip after teeth on the other one broke off.  It does happen, the clip is plastic so you just need to be a little careful.  I&#x27;m knocking off one star because the color of the lower clip in the picture isn&#x27;t what I got.  Mine was a more solid, metallic kind of brown.</li>
    <li> Would be great but spring is weak and wimpy. Disappointed..I bought some from a company called Mia. Much nicer clip for same price</li>
    <li> I thought these would be the large clips. Love the design but had to return because they could not possibly be used for my braided  hair. Sad because they are well made.</li>
    <li> My wife loves these clips because they are light and work on thin hair. They sit flat and aren&#x27;t a nuisance when driving the car - not hitting the head rest etc. She says that the best thing that can be done with this product is to have it placed back on store shelves so that the customer can pick and choose and not have to go to the bother of mail order.</li>
    <li> I like these as simple clips to keep hair back.  These are light plastic and although prone to breakage after frequent use, they are still my favorite style to use for daily twisting hair off my face.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair that is thinning with age.  So often hair clips are too big and fall out of my hair.  These are just the right size.  Probably great for kids as well!  Love these Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have long, thin hair and this clip doesn&#x27;t hold my hair back at all.  It may work fine for shoulder length hair, but not for longer or thicker hair.</li>
    <li> Very attractive, work well with my hair, although they don&#x27;t click &amp; close. But they&#x27;re large and attractive &amp; sophisticated looking.</li>
    <li> I have recently chopped off almost all my hair.  But for the 20 years I had very long hair this was the absolute best clip I ever found.  I have a lot of hair but my hair is very fine so the regular style big claw clips just flopped back and forth on my head and gave me headaches.  This is so the best thing since sliced bread if your hair is like mine :)</li>
    <li> I got these on clearance as my store was discontinuing them. They are my favorite clips! I had to come on here searching for them. The width of them makes them look more attractive in the hair. I have even got compliments on them! Buy these before they are gone.</li>
    <li> I love these clips and they are hard to find - perfect for medium (not long) fine hair.  Would not recommend for long or thick hair</li>
    <li> Did not hold my hair very well.</li>
    <li> These claw clips do not stick out on the back of your head but lie flat.  They do not bump on the car seat head rest.</li>
    <li> They work perfectly.  Keep my hair up and it&#x27;s a lot flatter than a normal clip!  Absolutely love them a lot.</li>
    <li> i had very old clips like these and was not able to find them in any store.  the price included shipping.  when i first got them  they looked the same size as what i had, but when i arrived they were smaller.  however, but after using them for a while, i think the size is actually better than what i had.  i will definately buy more.</li>
    <li> These clips are nice but not for long hair. I gave them to my granddaughter. They are small. Not what I expected.</li>
    <li> I have SUPER FINE (like baby fine), super straight, mid-back length, very healthy, brown hair.  Banana Clips don&#x27;t stay in my hair and neither do the other cute hair clips, because my hair is so soft, everything just falls out.  So it&#x27;s either pony-tail or down.  Now I&#x27;ve got these to play with and they seem to hold my hair quite well.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me as my hair is too thick and the clip couldn&#x27;t hold it.&lt;br /&gt;This will be great if you have thin hair.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t seen these in any stores and had been wanting this design for my medium length hair.  The price was a bit high, but if they worked, it would be worth it.  And they work!  These are the best hair clips I own.  I go for them time and time again.  I have fine, thick hair, and they never slide out like most of the others I&#x27;ve tried and own.  So, for all you gals with fine hair, the Erin Claw Clips will hold your hair.  I have one in my pocketbook all the time.  They are so easy to use, and I don&#x27;t have to constantly take my hair down and try to get them &amp;#34;in the right way&amp;#34; time after time.  They work well the first time and take almost no getting used to.  Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> These weren&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting.  They look like a bear claw clip in the picture, but the bottom clip is not actually flat, like it appears.</li>
    <li> Love these, they hold my fine hair all day long and never give me a headache. Also like that they lie flat so aren&#x27;t bumping into the headrest of the car while I&#x27;m driving.</li>
    <li> A great Clip, not big and bulky.Holds in your hair great and does not slip out, even with thick hair</li>
    <li> I gave her the black, shes blonde, the tortoiseshell looks better in my dark hair good size to use when you don&#x27;t want all your hair up.  too bad my dog liked too need to order another</li>
    <li> This is an excellent clip. I have fine hair and most clips won&#x27;t stay in for an hour, let alone all day. This clip will hold my hair ALL day even with my active lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product function is worth five stars but I gave it a four-star review because the color is inconsistent with the photo. I purchased several sets of these and some are as pictured while others are a horrible pearlescent color. I wear those when I don&#x27;t expect to have to see other people, but don&#x27;t appreciate that an option isn&#x27;t given for color or at least a warning in the ad that color can be expected to be inconsistent.</li>
    <li> The description of this product showed them as large but they only a little bigger than half of the large claw. The claws are sturdy though....just wish they were bigger</li>
    <li> Was not sure they would stay in my hair but they work fine.  The hold my long hair in place when I twist it into a small bun and are more flat than most clips and so make it easier to rest my head when driving or sitting. Wish they had more colors, especially a clear or frosted</li>
    <li> My wife was complaining that her previous clips broke, and I turned to Amazon for the answer.  These work great and came in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I was hoping these were larger however they do work well. It is hard to find these types in the stores and they don&#x27;t crimp my haor as badly as some others.</li>
    <li> This clip is designed so that the hinge shows from the front which is not very attractive.  It&#x27;s a shame, as from the side they are very pretty.  The hinge is so distracting that I don&#x27;t wear them.</li>
    <li> I love these clips and had a time finding them. I reordered these and then cut my hair. They were smaller than the orginal ones I had but they worked perfectly with my new hair!! LOve them!!</li>
    <li> These clips are made of a hard rubber like plastic, so they don&#x27;t crack or break easily. They are a little smaller than I thought, but I love them!</li>
    <li> The clips were delivered on time and the product delivered matches the pictures correctly. The colors delivered were not the same, I received 2 clips one black and the other a sold bronze color. Goody is a nice brand and this product is made with Goody quality.</li>
    <li> I used to buy these all the time! Best hair product I have ever used for pulling my hair back and out of the way. Then the stores stopped selling them and I cried and wrung my hands, refused to eat, stomped my feet and had massive temper tantrums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But today... luck was with me and I have finally found them again here on Amazon. Another reason to love Amazon even more!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am buying ten packages, just in case Amazon runs out!!</li>
    <li> These clips are exactly what I was hoping them to be. I&#x27;m growing my hair out and they work great at holding my hair up. I have fine hair and I&#x27;m pleased with them. I plan on ordering several more packages.</li>
    <li> I searched everywhere for side clips, hard to find. Settled on this brand, but find not quality, do not hold, and do not last. Do not waste your money on these, found cheaper and better quality on another site.</li>
    <li> This is something that I should have waited to buy in the store. The clips that I received were the same shape as those in the picture, and kind of the same color, but had a glittery shimmer. One was really more like copper color than the tortoise shell pictured. And they don&#x27;t actually hold up my hair.</li>
