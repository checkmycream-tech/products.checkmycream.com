      <li>This item is not returnable because it&#x27;s considered \\&quot;Hazardous</li>
      <li>This is a nice scent.</li>
      <li>When this bottle runs out, I will be purchasing more for sure!</li>
      <li>Plus, it&#x27;s so easy to shop online!</li>
      <li>were so positive and the scent in the store was so beautiful, but</li>
      <li>Im not a fan of floral scents but the sample smelled very nice this smell exactly like</li>
      <li>Love this fragrances?</li>
      <li>Toilette is always a cheaper way to have the perfume you love, except with Omnia Crystalline, we got screwed.</li>
      <li>I love this scent and have worn it before.</li>
      <li>And, on top of everything, we&#x27;re tricked by the titles of these products.</li>
      <li>This smells ok.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this perfum and have received many complimentss for it.  </li>
      <li>Love the perfume.</li>
      <li>I love the scent of this perfume.  </li>
      <li>Love this scent.</li>
      <li>It was a present and she loved it!</li>
      <li>It smells amazing and is exactly what i ordered.</li>
      <li>This is such a beautiful scent.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and worth the price.</li>
      <li>i would recommend if you like a light scent</li>
      <li>Was delivered very quickly in original packaging.</li>
      <li>Have had several compliments on this, smells clean and fresh, great deal over department store prices.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, the parfum arrived the next day and I am very pleased with the scent.</li>
      <li>but cool</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t confirm the difference in smell as its been months since my wife smelled the perfume at a store, but I can say that she really does enjoy it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very feminine and &amp;#34;sophisticated.&amp;#34; I love it.</li>
      <li>But first of all, the difference in the smell is HUGE and the parfum doesn&#x27;t seem to linger that much longer than the toilette, so I should have just gone with the toilette and resolved to apply it more often...</li>
      <li>Love this item more than my regular bvlgari.  </li>
      <li>The price was better than in the high end stores.</li>
      <li>I love the clean and subtle scent of most of the Bvlgari products, and this one is just that!  </li>
      <li>My new fragrance and even cheaper than duty free stores</li>
      <li>UPDATE: THIRD PURCHASE.... authentic ....</li>
      <li>This is the only scent i will ever buy again :)</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;It smells very lady like an</li>
      <li>but they shipped fast</li>
      <li>, glad I did not pay retail, fragrance does not last long at all,  wish I had passed on this</li>
      <li>I knew there would be some difference between the scent of the eau de toilette which I&#x27;ve worn for years and this eau de parfum, but I hoped that the parfum would be more long lasting and that would make up for the difference.</li>
      <li>The parfum smells nothing like the the toilette, we love the toilette smell WAY more than the parfum, but the toilette won&#x27;t last long, while the same &amp;#34;Crystalline&amp;#34; in parfum will last all day, yet it smells so different.</li>
      <li>This particular bottle smelled musty or old.</li>
      <li>this particular bottle of &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; just doesn&#x27;t smell the same.  </li>
      <li>I inquired with the seller because the delivery seemed to be taking longer than expected and they responded quickly and even offered to resend using a different carrier if I didn&#x27;t receive it.</li>
      <li>Delivery was much quicker than I expected!</li>
      <li>The package was sealed but the scent is much weaker than previous bottles...I have worn the eau de toilette and the perfume.</li>
      <li>I like the soft scent and the long lasting and not overpowering fragrance!</li>

<li> What is really unfortunate about this perfume, and what a lot of people on here are complaining about, is this:&lt;br /&gt;The Eau De Toilette and the L&#x27;eau De Parfum are both Crystalline scented, but we&#x27;ve all been screwed because the difference between all toilette&#x27;s and parfum&#x27;s is huge, but the should always be the same.</li>
<li> Bottle is too bulky to be practical, however, and worse, scent evaporates and leaves quickly.  </li>
<li> Parfums on the other hand, last all day and even into the next day if you don&#x27;t wash your hair.</li>
<li> Although I purchased the eau de toilette version of this fragrance, it lasts as long as my parfum purchases.</li>
<li> Toilette is cheaper, it doesn&#x27;t stay on as long, and you have to keep re-spraying throughout the day.</li>
<li> Something I can still smell a hint of at the end of a long day!</li>
<li> The bottle in the package I received is pink.  </li>
<li> Usually I order the Eau de Toilette but decided to try the L&#x27;eau de Parfum instead for a heavier scent that would last longer.  </li>
<li> I have no reason to give it less than 5 stars</li>
<li> I compared it to the same perfum in a perfum shop (to check if maybe I had purchased here a fake) and the case is the same</li>
<li> What a waste of money.</li>
<li> I truly love this perfume but very disappointed with the arrival.</li>
<li> Its not overwhelming but lasts all day.</li>
<li> sorry I am so late reviewing this.</li>
<li> Terrible experience and very unhappy with the product.</li>
<li> I what I received smells awful.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on me the same way the one I purchased from the department store..I think this was a knock off!</li>
    <li> Wife dis not like this one, prefered one from Macys but they shipped fast</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this perfum and have received many complimentss for it.  Bottle is too bulky to be practical, however, and worse, scent evaporates and leaves quickly.  I compared it to the same perfum in a perfum shop (to check if maybe I had purchased here a fake) and the case is the same: Bvlgari has not made a scen that lasts.  I must spray it several times a day to have the smell present.</li>
    <li> This is the best scent ive ever used! Its not overwhelming but lasts all day. This is the only scent i will ever buy again :)</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfumes and it was a great price in comparison to the mall. Thanks</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and the majority were so positive and the scent in the store was so beautiful, but I what I received smells awful. It is not the same perfume and it is not returnable. What a waste of money. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> She loved it, it was a great buying experience! Bottle looked very different but cool i would recommend if you like a light scent</li>
    <li> It smells amazing and is exactly what i ordered. I have no reason to give it less than 5 stars</li>
    <li> Love this perfume! Delivery was much quicker than I expected!</li>
    <li> I love the clean and subtle scent of most of the Bvlgari products, and this one is just that!  Plus, it&#x27;s so easy to shop online!</li>
    <li> My item was opened and damaged upon receipt It appeared as if someone opened it or mishandled it before packaging</li>
    <li> I am skeptical as to whether this is authentic. I love this scent and have worn it before. This bottle I purchased just doesn&#x27;t smell the same</li>
    <li> Wonderful, light and elegant scent! I receive numerous compliments when I wear this perfume. Was delivered very quickly in original packaging.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t confirm the difference in smell as its been months since my wife smelled the perfume at a store, but I can say that she really does enjoy it! Compared to a retail store the price is great, so I&#x27;m a satisfied customer.</li>

    <li> This particular bottle smelled musty or old. I did not like it at all. Amazon was wonderful about replacing it though and I am very happy with my other Bvlgari scents!</li>
    <li> sorry I am so late reviewing this. Love the perfume.</li>
    <li> This is a nice scent. I like all the Bvlgari Parfum&#x27;s. The price was better than in the high end stores.</li>
    <li> Love this item more than my regular bvlgari.  Love this scent.</li>

But first of all, the difference in the smell is HUGE and the parfum doesn&#x27;t seem to linger that much longer than the toilette, so I should have just gone with the toilette and resolved to apply it more often...</li>
    <li> I truly love this perfume but very disappointed with the arrival. It took awhile before we receive this product.&lt;br /&gt;But all in all the perfume is awesome.</li>
    <li> Not like the paper smell, glad I did not pay retail, fragrance does not last long at all,  wish I had passed on this</li>
    <li> My new fragrance and even cheaper than duty free stores</li>
    <li> Love this fragrances?</li>
    <li> This is such a beautiful scent. I get so many compliments when wearing this out! When this bottle runs out, I will be purchasing more for sure!</li>
    <li> What is really unfortunate about this perfume, and what a lot of people on here are complaining about, is this:&lt;br /&gt;The Eau De Toilette and the L&#x27;eau De Parfum are both Crystalline scented, but we&#x27;ve all been screwed because the difference between all toilette&#x27;s and parfum&#x27;s is huge, but the should always be the same. Toilette is cheaper, it doesn&#x27;t stay on as long, and you have to keep re-spraying throughout the day. Parfums on the other hand, last all day and even into the next day if you don&#x27;t wash your hair. With this product, we&#x27;ve been ROYALLY screwed over. The parfum smells nothing like the the toilette, we love the toilette smell WAY more than the parfum, but the toilette won&#x27;t last long, while the same &amp;#34;Crystalline&amp;#34; in parfum will last all day, yet it smells so different. And, on top of everything, we&#x27;re tricked by the titles of these products. &amp;#34;Eau De Toilette Perfume&amp;#34; ... That makes no sense! It&#x27;s either/or, there&#x27;s no such thing as a toilette perfume. So please don&#x27;t be fooled by these types of product names when you see them. Toilette is toilette, parfum is PERFUME, it stays on, and is always more expensive. Toilette is always a cheaper way to have the perfume you love, except with Omnia Crystalline, we got screwed. We buy the perfume, we lose because the smell is different; we buy the toilette, we&#x27;re screwed because it doesn&#x27;t stay on all day.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps explain the confusion and I hope it makes everyone start paying attention to the actual BOTTLE, not the product name that was written. Perfume and eau de toilette&#x27;s are two very different things!!</li>
    <li> I like the soft scent and the long lasting and not overpowering fragrance! Something I can still smell a hint of at the end of a long day!</li>
    <li> Great fragrance, a nice addition to what I have. Have had several compliments on this, smells clean and fresh, great deal over department store prices.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and worth the price. They were charging 99 at Macys and I got it for 53.. that&#x27;s a score!!!</li>
    <li> UPDATE: THIRD PURCHASE.... authentic ....l love this!!!  feminine and smell good...I accidentally broke this in the bathroom at work...purchased again!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this perfume for years....this particular bottle of &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; just doesn&#x27;t smell the same.  The package was sealed but the scent is much weaker than previous bottles...I have worn the eau de toilette and the perfume.</li>
    <li> The bottle in the package I received is pink.  The photo is not, it&#x27;s silver.  This item is not returnable because it&#x27;s considered \\&quot;Hazardous Material\\&quot;.... Terrible experience and very unhappy with the product.</li>
    <li> It was a present and she loved it!</li>
    <li> Love it! I love the scent of this perfume.  It lasts all day and smells great.  Great price as well.</li>
    <li> Im not a fan of floral scents but the sample smelled very nice this smell exactly like it.&lt;br /&gt;It smells very lady like an is amazing.</li>
