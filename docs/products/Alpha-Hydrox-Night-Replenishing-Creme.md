### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I am happy!</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product.  </li>
      <li>What I like best is that when I wake my face doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;over moisturized&amp;#34; and greasy.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy about this purchase!</li>
      <li>My skin looks best at night.</li>
      <li>I have purchased the Alpha Hydrox Enhanced Cream with wonderful results</li>
      <li>I believe this is one of the best products for the skin on the market.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s as excellent as the one with acid.</li>
      <li>Best night cream ever!</li>
      <li>A great price will order again!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s an awesome product.</li>
      <li>But when I learned that moisturizers will not work on your face unless you exfoliate, and chemical exfoliation is the best, I decided to try this brand of alpha hydroxy.  </li>
      <li>and it is the perfect amount.  </li>
      <li>just the PERFECT amount.  </li>
      <li>GREAT BUY!!!!</li>
      <li>They have great skin care products at affordable prices.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s great.  </li>

      <li>great product with a great price.</li>
      <li>I Love It !!</li>
      <li>Very nice product for moisturizing and helping skin renewal</li>
      <li>Wonderful night Creme not quite as strong as the lotion</li>
      <li>Good price for the effects</li>
      <li>So I think this product is good for what it advertises, but not for what he wanted to use it for.</li>
      <li>It did start out working fairly well, but after about 2 weeks, the process came to a halt.</li>
      <li>It is a great product, and I am already seeing a decrease in fine lines and wrinkles!  </li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product despite the lack of AHA one would expect in a product called \\&quot;Alpha Hydrox\\&quot;</li>
      <li>This has a nice creamy feel to it and feels good on my skin.</li>
      <li>More money for shopping!</li>
      <li>The Alpha Hydrox line is my favorite!</li>
      <li>It would be nice if the description disclosed that info.</li>
      <li>A nice night cream.</li>
      <li>It is a nice cream, but I wanted AHA to work on my skin over night.</li>
      <li>Nice cream that moisturizes.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my skin nice and moist.</li>
      <li>I would not buy it again for my own use.  </li>
      <li>fast absorbent, no smell - great results!</li>
      <li>Neither here nor there - Gold Bond creams are cheaper, more generous and effective.  </li>
      <li>so far it is the Best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>This stuff absorbs better than anything I&#x27;ve ever put on my face.</li>
      <li>I use the Alpha Hydrox Face Wash and love it.</li>
      <li>I love all the Alpha Hydrox products.</li>
      <li>Be sure to purchase the under eye, lip cream.  </li>
      <li>I am pleased.</li>
      <li>have tried many products</li>
      <li>I love it and</li>
      <li>but I know that I am safe with this one.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>I love their toner though.</li>
      <li>Hopefully,  it will produce even better results with continued use.</li>
      <li>this is one of my all time favorite products.</li>
      <li>But, that&#x27;s OK, because I think that it helps diminish my fine wrinkles.</li>
      <li>wish it were more readily available.</li>
      <li>happy with the product so far.</li>
      <li>GOOD CREAM FAST SHIPPING</li>
      <li>The products shipped on time, were packaged fine and were as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and I can see some of the fine lines and wrinkles are gone.  </li>
      <li>I will continue to enjoy my Chanel beauty products, but these two items have replaced the night and day cream.  </li>
      <li>I can get away with a light application of a light moisturizer to wear underneath my makeup.</li>
      <li>2-oz&lt;br /&gt;Bought for $10.59, FREE</li>
      <li>It is non greasy and light and makes my skin look refreshed.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t give me breakouts and it makes my skin smooth and not greasy.</li>
      <li>Everyone wants great skin care products, but not everyone can afford high priced products!</li>
      <li>This is the one thing that made them look normal and healthy!</li>
      <li>(I just like the feeling) and tend to use products that can dry out my skin (Fair and Lovely, benzoyl peroxide).</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m getting the original.</li>
      <li>My laugh lines and crows feet are going away!</li>
      <li>I take online classes full time</li>
      <li>so may be more gentle for people to start with and work up to the lotion.</li>
      <li>I am Asian with light to medium complexion (more light).</li>
      <li>Perfect amount of moisturizer, my skin is normal but I just felt like I needed a little bit of moisture</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a new face cream and there are so many to choose.</li>
      <li>This product has made my face feel so  soft and moist and has reduced the appearance of many of my wrinkles.</li>
      <li>but I rarely put a review.</li>
      <li>So far I am pleased with this product and would buy it again.</li>
      <li>I have been using this lotion for a long time, and I love it!</li>
      <li>I woke up this morning and looked in the mirror right away.</li>
      <li>And the price is right.  </li>
      <li>and I guess I had uneven skin tone because this stuff will make your skin looking absolutely amazing!</li>
      <li>It might be good for someone else, but I saw no significant results from using it at all.</li>
      <li>It really evens out your skin tone and makes your skin glow!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>I have had big pores on my nose all my life and tried many products.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more when I get low on this</li>
      <li>This cream felt really good on my face, but after using if for a few weeks I really didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in my skin texture or tone.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to have any positive benefit on my skin and since I&#x27;m prone to breakouts the greasy texture</li>
      <li>My face looks better than it has for a long time--&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This product is not heavy and absorbs quickly into the skin - with no oily reside.  </li>
      <li>Although I have oily skin (most specifically on my T-Zone), my cheeks tend to get dry.</li>
      <li>For a pure moisture fix, this is what your skin needs.  </li>
      <li>Mineral oil is basically a petro oil, which is something that can make your car run in certain forms.</li>
      <li>instead it&#x27;s  soft and ready for a quick cleans and my morning moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I have aging skin, well, I guess we all do, but, these products have reduced my fine lines and wrinkles, immensely.  </li>
      <li>I notice that when I go a decent amount of time without it, my skin does flake as I wash my skin often in hot water</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t notice any real difference in my skin or improvement</li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>Bought this cream as I like a lot of the Hydrox skin line but this one really didn&#x27;t impress me.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have fairly normal skin that leans toward dry.  I often experience a bit of a breakout when I try new products.  Not with this cream though.  What I like best is that when I wake my face doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;over moisturized&amp;#34; and greasy.  instead it&#x27;s  soft and ready for a quick cleans and my morning moisturizer. A nice night cream.</li>
    <li> If you are an older woman with dry skin, no glow, and tired look, this is for you. It exfoliates your skin and leaves it silky soft ready for a moisturizer...</li>
    <li> Noticed a tingling sensation and firming.</li>
    <li> this is one of my all time favorite products. It really evens out your skin tone and makes your skin glow! I use it at night before I go to bed and when I go to apply my makeup in the morning after my shower you can really see how even this stuff has made my skin appear. I&#x27;m 34 with no wrinkles and a few fine lines and I guess I had uneven skin tone because this stuff will make your skin looking absolutely amazing! fast absorbent, no smell - great results!</li>
    <li> I have bought a wrong one. Actually, I want one with acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope it&#x27;s as excellent as the one with acid.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for a long time, and I love it! My skin is so soft (but not greasy) after I use it, and I think that my wrinkles have diminished (I had faint wrinkles). For some people, it helps with their acne.  I still get pimples every so often, and it doesn&#x27;t really help heal my pimples. But, that&#x27;s OK, because I think that it helps diminish my fine wrinkles.</li>
    <li> IT IS NICE, BUT A LITTLE TOO THICK FOR MY TASTE</li>
    <li> Ive been using this for decades it&#x27;s an awesome product.</li>
    <li> Perfect amount of moisturizer, my skin is normal but I just felt like I needed a little bit of moisture so I tried this and it is the perfect amount.  Not greasy, not too moisturizing... just the PERFECT amount.  I use it at night after I wash my face and in the morning after a shower with a sunscreen and it&#x27;s great.  I will be ordering more when I get low on this and you don&#x27;t need much.  GREAT BUY!!!!</li>
    <li> I having been using this cream for about 15 years. I attribute not looking my age to this miracle cream.&lt;br /&gt;It is the only cream that actually keeps my skin hydrated and looking refeshed!</li>
    <li> This cream was sort of greasy and not at all what I expected based on the description. It didn&#x27;t seem to have any positive benefit on my skin and since I&#x27;m prone to breakouts the greasy texture made me worry it would clog pores.  I love their other products, so this was a real disappointment.</li>
    <li> I bought the fase wash, the night cream, and the enhanced lotion.  My face looks better than it has for a long time--&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many products and I believe I have finally found three that work for me!!  I am 79 years old.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to know if it actually does what it claims to do, but have not found anything negative about it.</li>
    <li> Very over-rated. I would not go out of my way again to purchase any alpha hydrox product. Product is typical for a cream, nothing special about it. Claims about product should be re-evaluated.</li>
    <li> This product exxeeded my expectations! It smoothed out the tiny bumps on my face. Its light enough to wear during the day also.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know that this product contains No AHA. I thought I was buying AHA night cream until the package arrived with that information on the box. It is a nice cream, but I wanted AHA to work on my skin over night.</li>
    <li> For a pure moisture fix, this is what your skin needs.  No fuss, no youth promises in a jar - and no oils.  I&#x27;ve dropped a dollop on a silky nightgown with no oily residue left behind ...</li>
    <li> This has a nice creamy feel to it and feels good on my skin. It is non irritating and I will order this again.</li>
    <li> great product with a great price. I used it years ago and recently saw a Dr. Oz segment about similar products and was reminded of the value.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a new face cream and there are so many to choose. This one meets all the requirements of alpha hydrox. not too gresy and the price is wayyyyyy cheaper than most other face creams offering the same ingredients.</li>
    <li> I am a 68 year woman with light complexion and  very dry skin. This product has made my face feel so  soft and moist and has reduced the appearance of many of my wrinkles. I Love It !!</li>
    <li> I thought since this was produced by the AHA company it would have AHA in it. Unfortunately I misread the description. Its very hydrating though&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: Now that I&#x27;ve gotten over the fact it does not have AHA, and have incorporated into my nightly routine, I have to stay it does wonders for me. I&#x27;ve been using it throughout the polar vortex in Cleveland OH during winter, and it really helped to keep my skin stay supple in the winter months. I notice that when I go a decent amount of time without it, my skin does flake as I wash my skin often in hot water (I just like the feeling) and tend to use products that can dry out my skin (Fair and Lovely, benzoyl peroxide). I use this, with BP and F&amp;L and AHA 10% glycolic lotion at night and in the morning, my skin looks absolutely radiant. I can get away with a light application of a light moisturizer to wear underneath my makeup. This really is a lovely cream, and has helped keep away acne (from my usually oily acne prone skin) while at the same time keeping me very hydrated. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product despite the lack of AHA one would expect in a product called \\&quot;Alpha Hydrox\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This cream felt really good on my face, but after using if for a few weeks I really didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in my skin texture or tone.</li>
    <li> It seems to be helping a little, but I will keep using it and maybe after a while I will see better results.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews for various products I ordered both the day and night cream.  It is a great product, and I am already seeing a decrease in fine lines and wrinkles!  I have no problem dropping money on high-quality products, I use the Chanel line, but these 2 products have become my night and day cream.  I will continue to enjoy my Chanel beauty products, but these two items have replaced the night and day cream.  More money for shopping!</li>
    <li> I have used this product along with the Enhanced cream and foaming face wash for 6 wks now- I can definately see the difference in my skin. My skin appears firmer, pores smaller and I have had a lot less breakouts since beginning this regimen. I would definately recommend it!</li>
    <li> I do not like the consistency. It is like the consistency of yogurt, only with lots of oils.  I did not like it.</li>
    <li> I love all the Alpha Hydrox products. This one doesn&#x27;t have Alpha hydroxy in it, it is just for moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Skin feels softer and looks healthier.  Was having a problem with using products that were breaking me out.  This is not breaking me out.  Will continue to purchase.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> there is nothing of value in this product</li>
    <li> Looks like a temporary face lift after applying.  I love it and so far it is the Best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> My son was hopeful this product would fade his tatoo he dislikes. It did start out working fairly well, but after about 2 weeks, the process came to a halt. So I think this product is good for what it advertises, but not for what he wanted to use it for.</li>
    <li> I am very allergic to almost everything out there for skin, even the hypoallergenic products.  But when I learned that moisturizers will not work on your face unless you exfoliate, and chemical exfoliation is the best, I decided to try this brand of alpha hydroxy.  I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now - and my skin is tolerating it very well.  I can see the younger skin peeking out now, and my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this great in a long, long time.  You can wear it under moisturizer - but ALWAYS put sunblock on if you are going out in the sun as this product removes all the old skin - and the new skin is delicate and prone to sunburn (and age spots).  My skin appears so much younger and I can see some of the fine lines and wrinkles are gone.  And the price is right.  I expect this jar will last me at least six months - even though I am using it on my face, neck, and chest.  In addition, it does not have an unpleasant odor.</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive so I broke out . Doesn&#x27;t mean its a bad product though.  I just have no luck with cremes, they all seem to cause break out.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t read the Ingredients  and found this product contain Mineral oil which can clog your pores. The Vitimin E it claims to have is 18th on the list.. my bad for not reading this first. Mineral oil is basically a petro oil, which is something that can make your car run in certain forms. It does not allow your skin to breath..</li>
    <li> GOOD CREAM FAST SHIPPING</li>
    <li> Nice cream that moisturizes.  I could see a difference the next morning.  Hopefully,  it will produce even better results with continued use.</li>
    <li> I saw this suggestion on the Dr. Oz show.  So far I am pleased with this product and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cream only a week ago and can already see a difference in my face! My laugh lines and crows feet are going away! I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this again!</li>
    <li> Just a little goes a long way...</li>
    <li> Neither here nor there - Gold Bond creams are cheaper, more generous and effective.  I wouldn&#x27;t bother buying this cream again which I find greasy, thin and not particularly effective.  I like this company&#x27;s alpha-hydoxy products, but find the replenishing cream not worth the cost.</li>
    <li> CANNOT TELL THAT THIS PRODUCT HAS ANY AFFECT ON MY SKIN AT ALL. IHAVE USED IT NOW FOR  ABOUT THREE WEEKS. IT DOES HAVE A BURNING SENSATION SO THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE DOING SOMETHING???</li>
    <li> Works for me! moisturizes my skin. but I had chemical peel and used this and really calms my skin,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of moisturizers and night cremes. The Alpha Hydrox line is my favorite! I carefully read through all the reviews before I ordered this night creme. It works great. Not too heavy or greasy.</li>
    <li> I have purchased the Alpha Hydrox Enhanced Cream with wonderful results so I thought I would try the Night version. I usually like night creams because they are so thick and I have very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised when my cream arrived last night with no barrier - as if it had already been opened. And, as I was inspecting the jar, I realize the ingredients were nothing like those in the Enhanced Cream...there are no glycolic AHAs and there are parabens added. It&#x27;s going back and I&#x27;m getting the original.</li>
    <li> One of the earlier reviews said there is no AHA in this cream and that is correct.  Says so on the box.  My cream was shipped with a loose lid so I am returning it.  Product dry and messy inside lid etc.&lt;br /&gt;Sounds like others like it regardless of the absence of AHA.  It would be nice if the description disclosed that info.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for 18 years now.  I always get compliments on my skin and do not get blemishes.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t give me breakouts and it makes my skin smooth and not greasy.</li>
    <li> This keeps skin firm and clear, and is better than products that cost 10 times as much, literally. I will continue to buy this as long as they make it.</li>
    <li> This came in an Alpha Hydrox box, but the container was completely plain, no label, logo or ingredients. Nothing. Just a white container.  I think that&#x27;s odd.  Not sure it&#x27;s authentic.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  I am allergic to quite a few cremes, colognes, etc. but I know that I am safe with this one.</li>
    <li> Very nice product for moisturizing and helping skin renewal, I have seen a difference in my skin over the months using it. Consistency is the key here. Good price for the effects</li>
    <li> I believe in using products with alpha hydroxy but there are difficult to locate. I had used a face wash by Neutrogena, but that seems to be no longer made. I use the Alpha Hydrox Face Wash and love it. So I decided to use the night creme. It is non greasy and light and makes my skin look refreshed. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I really like the alpha hydrox products. They have great skin care products at affordable prices. Everyone wants great skin care products, but not everyone can afford high priced products! The products shipped on time, were packaged fine and were as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;I would order from them again.</li>
    <li> It does not have Alpha Hydrox. I thought it has. It&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> I DID NOT LIKE THE CREAM AT ALL.  I WOULD NOT ORDER IT AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Best night cream ever!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and will continue to do so. My everyday cream. wish it were more readily available.</li>
    <li> This stuff is nice and moisturizing yet doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy. I am acne prone and this has not broken me out. I use a glycolic acid peel and I use this as my moisturizer after for a few days. Keeps my skin nice and moist. Great price, will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I would not buy it again for my own use.  It might be good for someone else, but I saw no significant results from using it at all.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t notice any real difference in my skin or improvement</li>
    <li> This product is not heavy and absorbs quickly into the skin - with no oily reside.  After only a couple of weeks I can see a major difference!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Any product by this company is a winner.  I have aging skin, well, I guess we all do, but, these products have reduced my fine lines and wrinkles, immensely.  Be sure to purchase the under eye, lip cream.  I am happy!</li>
    <li> too soon to tell, haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to see a noticeable difference yet.  happy with the product so far.</li>
    <li> Bought this cream as I like a lot of the Hydrox skin line but this one really didn&#x27;t impress me.  I love their toner though.</li>
    <li> No feeling about use means no change after use</li>
    <li> Although I really notice a difference in my skin, I find it to be a little greasy when I put it on. This could be my skin type.&lt;br /&gt;I would still recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This item has ZERO Alpha Hydroxy ingrediants in it.  I was tricked into buying it - it even says on the jar- &amp;#34;this item does not contain alpha hydrox.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Wonderful night Creme not quite as strong as the lotion so may be more gentle for people to start with and work up to the lotion. A great price will order again!</li>
    <li> Have not seen any results after using this product for over 35 days. I will continue to use it for the next 30 days.</li>
    <li> Product left my skin very dry... Waist of money as I could not return items.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I have had big pores on my nose all my life and tried many products.  This is the one thing that made them look normal and healthy!</li>
    <li> Sorry for the rather long review, but I just want to emphasize that it DOES work!!!&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW FOR: Alpha Hydrox Night Replenishing Creme 2-oz&lt;br /&gt;Bought for $10.59, FREE shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, EXTREMELY FAST delivery (not using Prime shipping). Ordered on April 13, 2013 (Saturday) and received Thursday April 18th (considering it was just regular shipping method and it had 4 other products along with it!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a bit of background to fully understand the condition my skin is in: I am a busy mother, 34 years of age. I take online classes full time so my skin really shows how exhausted I am from school work, taking care of my son, being a housewife and working on freelance projects. It is dehydrated and greasy at the same time. I am Asian with light to medium complexion (more light). I have an oily-combination skin and my skin tends to get really oily around noon. My skin looks best at night. Although I have oily skin (most specifically on my T-Zone), my cheeks tend to get dry. The skin around my nose also gets dry (and flaky) and gets red from sensitivity to a lot of products I put on my face I guess. You can also definitely see my wrinkles on my forehead. It is also hard to put a concealer under my eye (which really needs it) because it wrinkles. Not only do I have to battle with wrinkles, and oily skin, I also have to worry about the monthly break outs (that seems to heal once a new break out is about to emerge!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 months ago, I decided to stay natural, so I stopped using all face cleaning wash (bath &amp; body tea tree face wash), face lotion (aveeno clear complexion) and tretinoin cream (0.25%) and started to do oil cleansing method. My face looked very tired and my face broke out more often than before. So I again started hunting for what I can do for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a lot of products costing from under $10 over the counter to very expensive kits that costs $400+ (Neutrogena, Bioderm, La Roche-Posay, Obagi, Lancome, Almay, Clinique, Proactiv, etc...) I also get monthly facial but haven&#x27;t done so since a month before I started the oil cleansing method (I figure, that is probably why my face looks so tired, wrinkly and broke out like crazy!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night, I finally decided to start using this product. OMG! Why did I wait this long to try this? I knew about this product line for a very very long time but not once have I tried it. No, I am NOT getting paid for this review. I have ordered thousands of dollars worth of products here on amazon for a few years now but I rarely put a review. I cleansed my face using their Alpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash -- 6 fl oz, then used this as my moisturizer. I skipped the tretinoin cream last night. Within minutes, my skin felt less wrinkly (and I couldn&#x27;t believe it). It is not greasy and no strong smell either. I was still skeptical and decided to wait until the next day. I woke up this morning and looked in the mirror right away. Considering that I barely slept all night because I was taking care of my sick toddler throughout the night, my skin looked like I had a full night&#x27;s sleep! The lines on my forehead is barely noticeable and my face looks brighter and refreshed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy about this purchase! It really works.</li>
    <li> This stuff absorbs better than anything I&#x27;ve ever put on my face. I&#x27;m not concerned about it rubbing off on my pillow at all. It doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy, only shiny.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t wast your money.</li>
    <li> It has really helped, putting this on before I go to sleep. The cold really does a number on my older skin.I am pleased.</li>
    <li> I thought this product contained alpha hydroxy acid in it like the name would imply but in does NOT. No AHA at all.&lt;br /&gt;VERY disappointed. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Again, what can I say?  I believe this is one of the best products for the skin on the market.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
