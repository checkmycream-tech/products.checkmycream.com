      <li>The formula has been changed, and for the better because it cleans better and lasts longer.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and I have been using this site childhood .</li>
      <li>I have been buying Pears soap for many years.</li>
      <li>The Customer Service with Amazon was outstanding.</li>
      <li>i simply love the smell and look of this soap.</li>
      <li>It even qualified for free shipping!</li>
      <li>great for sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product for children, or anyone with any kind of skin condition such as eczema, because it&#x27;s so mild.  </li>
      <li>I bought some of this soap but it has a strong perfume scent that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
      <li>Just a great simple soap.</li>
      <li>our allergies are put at bay, and the smell is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>original formula for 200 years had 8 ingredients.  </li>
      <li>It was worth it!</li>
      <li>This was NOT the original Pears soap as was pictured.</li>
      <li>Would thoroughly recommend it for it&#x27;s texture, perfect for dry skin and normal.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t smell the same as it used to - I bought the first bar of this I&#x27;ve had in ages, thinking happily that it would remind me of childhood.</li>
      <li>First, the box now proudly says made by Unilever (the giant multi national).</li>
      <li>Because it&#x27;s not within the 30-day return period, I cannot return this product for a full refund, and they will not refund my shipping.</li>
      <li>I thought I had found is more pure, has fewer ingredients with no artificial colorings.</li>
      <li>The soaps are reasonably priced, they were promptly shipped, and I didn&#x27;t have to fly back to the UK to find it!</li>
      <li>I wish I didn&#x27;t go through a bar so quickly, though.</li>
      <li>I have never found such a wonderful soap such as Pears.</li>
      <li>The ingredients looked promising with no added junk and thought it would make a great homemade detergent (Especially for diapers) Just shred the bar (and using this instead of Fels Naptha) and add washing soda and borax.</li>
      <li>I only use this soap and it&#x27;s a very convenient way to order at a great price.</li>
      <li>It no longer smells natural but more like Mr. Clean or insecticide.  </li>
      <li>slightly masculine, clean and fresh.i also love the color and translucency.</li>
      <li>The soap is long lasting and has a great scent!  </li>
      <li>Smells fresh.</li>
      <li>This product is worth the money.  </li>
      <li>Worth for the money we paid</li>
      <li>I assume this is another bone head change by a new corporate owner to a wonderful product with a loyal following.</li>
      <li>If you are ambivalent after reading conflicting reviews, buy a single bar at a local store before ordering from Amazon at a very good price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best green soap around at a low cost.</li>
      <li>Be aware before you order your Pears Soap.</li>
      <li>I just used one of the bars from this package for the first time.</li>
      <li>DO NOT order this if you want the original natural PEARS soap!  </li>
      <li>The first time I bought this, it was on clearance at a drug store.</li>
      <li>leaves your skin smooth and well moisturized, with no heavy fragrance.</li>
      <li>I first used it in Wales and England in 1968, where I purchased it during a summer university session.  </li>
      <li>I love this soap-so quintessentially English-</li>
      <li>I know,I am English,and encountered this soap in many upper class homes.</li>
      <li>This is not the same Pears soap I have been using for many years.</li>
      <li>The original listed ingredients were: Sodium Palmitate, Natural Rosin, Glycerine, Water, Sodium Cocoate, Rosemary Extract, Thyme Extract, Pears Fragrance Essence.    </li>
      <li>Original ingredients: Sodium Palmitate, Natural Rosin, Glycerine, Water, Sodium Cocoate, Rosemary Extract, Thyme Extract, Pears Fragrance Essence.    </li>
      <li>It keeps my skin soft and clean feeling.  </li>
      <li>Pears is an old English brand of mild glycerine soap that had a lovely scent.</li>
      <li>A gentle, cleasing soup that doesn&#x27;t get too gooey in hot humid summer.  </li>
      <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It is totally pure.</li>
      <li>/&gt; nice to get a hard to find item and get it quick.</li>
      <li>Despite that, this soaps crisp herbal scent is refreshing, and I can&#x27;t stand to use other soaps anymore.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Interesting, by the way, how similar many of the recent &amp;#34;positive&amp;#34; reviews are to one another -- quick, glib 5-star endorsements....</li>
      <li>Thanks to Amazon</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>just a regular we use and bought it as it was a free shipping day.</li>
      <li>Unless my childhood bath time really smelled like insecticide, that is -- which is NOT how I remember it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for many years, so I obviously love it.  It isn&#x27;t available locally, so I&#x27;ve always had to order it.  It&#x27;s very mild and non-irritating, and I love the smell of thyme!</li>
    <li> The page listing only has 7 ingredients but the actual product that arrived at my home has over 20 ingredients including the harsh chemicals, Peg-4, EDTA, BHT, and Red and Yellow dyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not have ordered this product if I knew that at the time. This is going back to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients printed on box in order: Water, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sorbitol, Sodium Rosinate, Sodium Palmate, Glycerin, Sodium Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, PEG-4, Alcohol Denat, Sodium Chloride, Fragrance, Sodium metabisulfite, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Tetrasodium EDTA, BHT, Thymus Vulgraris (Thyme) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis Leaf (Rosemary) Extract, D&amp;C Yellow No. 10 (CI 47005), D&amp;C Red No33 (Cl 17200).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;False Advertising, Ingredients listed on page when I purchased this from Amazon: Palmitate, Natural Rosin, Glycerine Water, Sodium Cocoate, Rosemary Extract, Thyme Extract, Pears Fragrance Esssence.</li>
    <li> Pears soap&#x27;s formula has changed as of 2009.  It is no longer the wonderful, natural product we all knew and loved.    Original ingredients: Sodium Palmitate, Natural Rosin, Glycerine, Water, Sodium Cocoate, Rosemary Extract, Thyme Extract, Pears Fragrance Essence.    New ingredients: Sorbitol, Aqua, Sodium Palmate/stearate, Sodium Palmkernelate, Sodium Rosinate, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, PEG-4, Alcohol, Glycerin, Perfume, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Meta Bisulfite, Etidronic acid, Tetra Sodium EDTA, BHT, Cl 12490, Cl 47005, Benzyl Benzoate, Benzyl Salicylate, Cinnamal, Eugenol, Limonene, Linalool.</li>
    <li> I have been buying Pears soap for many years. I just used one of the bars from this package for the first time. While the soap resembles Pears, it is not. First of all, it stinks - really awful. Second, upon reading the new ingredients list, I was shocked to see that the soap is now made up of primarily chemicals, nothing like the purity of the original soap. Finally, the soap left my skin extremely dry and itchy. I am upset that I purchased a case of this soap believing that it was the same soap that I&#x27;ve bought for years. There is nothing on Amazon&#x27;s site that makes clear to the buyer that this product has been completely reformulated. Because it&#x27;s not within the 30-day return period, I cannot return this product for a full refund, and they will not refund my shipping. It&#x27;s going in the trash where it belongs. What a waste! Don&#x27;t let this happen to you. I wish I could give this 0 stars.</li>
    <li> This product is worth the money.  The soap is long lasting and has a great scent!  I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement in my skin since I started using this product; it adds a great deal of moisture.</li>
    <li> The first time I bought this, it was on clearance at a drug store. After using it, I went back to stock up on more, but they had none left. Almost a year later I found it at another drug store, again on clearance. This time I bought all the bars they had left, and I&#x27;ve been working my way through them for the last few years. I&#x27;m getting close to being out, so I&#x27;m really happy to have found it on Amazon.    I generally can&#x27;t stand scented or perfumed products. I only buy perfume &amp; dye free laundry detergents, etc. Despite that, this soaps crisp herbal scent is refreshing, and I can&#x27;t stand to use other soaps anymore.</li>
    <li> I just received a new case of Pears soap. I have been using this soap for over 30 years. I was shocked this morning when I opened the first bar of the new case. It smells awful and left my skin very dry and itchy. Below is a comparison of old and new ingredients. The new ingredient list is a caustic chemical frappe!    Those looking for the soap they remember can avoid the similarly packaged new soap by paying attention to the ingredients listed on the packaging.    The original listed ingredients were: Sodium Palmitate, Natural Rosin, Glycerine, Water, Sodium Cocoate, Rosemary Extract, Thyme Extract, Pears Fragrance Essence.    The listed ingredients of the new soap are: Sorbitol, Aqua, Sodium Palmate/stearate, Sodium Palmkernelate, Sodium Rosinate, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, PEG-4, Alcohol, Glycerin, Perfume, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Meta Bisulfite, Etidronic acid, Tetra Sodium EDTA, BHT, Cl 12490, Cl 47005, Benzyl Benzoate, Benzyl Salicylate, Cinnamal, Eugenol, Limonene, Linalool.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST soap around!  Leaves your skin feeling squeeky clean!!</li>
    <li> To all those looking for this soap, I found it at my local Dollar Tree. The ingredients looked promising with no added junk and thought it would make a great homemade detergent (Especially for diapers) Just shred the bar (and using this instead of Fels Naptha) and add washing soda and borax. We&#x27;ll see how well it works!</li>
    <li> Excellent soap. I used to use this when I was young and have not purchased it in years. I saw some at a friends house and decided to buy it again. It was worth it! I think the price is great for what you get. The soap is not drying and I like that the ingredients are minimal. I have tried lots of other soaps with \\&quot;moisturizing agents\\&quot; in them and still have to slather lotion on afterwards. Not so with Pears. Think its time to stock up!</li>
    <li> Ordered these in bulk for my husband. He really likes glycerin soap and they are getting harder to find. These don&#x27;t leave a soap build up in the shower so I&#x27;m assuming they rinse cleaner off skin too. Nothing to be allergic to so no itching or dry skin. Nice size bars, you&#x27;re getting a lot of soap per bar. Don&#x27;t dry out and crumble. Don&#x27;t dissolve. Just a great simple soap. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it a 4 if it made me(or my husband) look 10 years younger I&#x27;d give it a 5.</li>
    <li> This soap is very difficult to find.  I&#x27;ve looked in all the stores and no one seems to carry it anymore.  It&#x27;s a great product for children, or anyone with any kind of skin condition such as eczema, because it&#x27;s so mild.  It&#x27;s a terrific product and I was DELIGHTED to find it on Amazon.  It even qualified for free shipping!</li>
    <li> This is wonderful soap!  I have very dry skin and this soap has already made a difference.  It smells so good too. I would recommend it to anyone with dry skin.  I wash my hands dozens of times a day and they just keep getting smoother instead of dryer.  The bars are a good size too.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> For years I have used Pears soap... I first used it in Wales and England in 1968, where I purchased it during a summer university session.  When I did not find it in stores in my area, I ordered online!  Cheers for Pears!</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for years and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> It caused itchiness and at the end had to get rid of all of them.Not made the same as before. won&#x27;t ever buy them.</li>
    <li> Good service.  Product was as describe</li>
    <li> I am such a soap snob. I believe I have purchased every soap on the market. I have never found such a wonderful soap such as Pears. The lather is perfect, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, and the scent is amazing. The only downside is I have to hide it from my 18 year old son, who loves it as much as I do. It can be purchased at Rite Aid. But I must buy a larger supply for my home. Once you use Pears soap, you will never go back to using anything else.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give negative stars.      Until I read the other reviews, noting that Pears had dramatically changed their 200-year-old formula, I thought that I had purchased a counterfeit soap.  It looks similar to the old soap, with the same warm color and general size, but the smell was strikingly different.  It no longer smells natural but more like Mr. Clean or insecticide.  I have sensitive skin, and after a week I noted that my eczema flared up.      I compared the new box to the old box and saw some radical differences.  The old box noted that the soap was hypo-allergenic and non-comedogenic.  The new box is silent, deleting the claim.  The old box listed eight natural looking ingredients.  The new box lists 23 ingredients, including Sodium Meta Bisulfite, Etidronic acid, Tetra Sodium EDTA, BHT, Cl 12490, Cl 47005, Benzyl Benzoate, Benzyl Salicylate.      Whoah.  I&#x27;m not rubbing these chemicals into my kids&#x27; skin.  I threw all twelve bars in the trash.  After 30 years using this soap, we are done.  Bring back the old formula!</li>
    <li> Be aware before you order your Pears Soap. It is now made in India using a new formula since 2010. It is NOT the same Pears Soap.</li>
    <li> Saved a lot of money buying these in bulk over the Neutrogena brand and did the same job.  Smells fresh.</li>
    <li> Love this soap!  It surpasses all other bar soaps....leaves your skin smooth and well moisturized, with no heavy fragrance.</li>
    <li> The formula changed for this soap.  I don&#x27;t like the smell of it or the fact that it makes my skin burn.  Guess I&#x27;ll give it to mt sister....sigh.</li>
    <li> I love this soap-so quintessentially English-I know,I am English,and encountered this soap in many upper class homes.They probably used it at Downton Abbey !Our guests just love this soap!!!!</li>
    <li> This is not the same Pears soap I have been using for many years. The perfume is totally different and almost non-existent. I have purchased what was supposedly the same product from this supplier in the past and it was fine, but this is terrible.  I can no longer recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Lillie Langtry used this soap and she knew an excellent soap for her face and keeping herself beautiful!  Great Soap!</li>
    <li> The price was great on this glycerine! I mix it 50/50 with witch hazel as a topical treatment for my psoriasis.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell the same as it used to - I bought the first bar of this I&#x27;ve had in ages, thinking happily that it would remind me of childhood. But alas no.  Unless my childhood bath time really smelled like insecticide, that is -- which is NOT how I remember it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interesting, by the way, how similar many of the recent &amp;#34;positive&amp;#34; reviews are to one another -- quick, glib 5-star endorsements....</li>
    <li> I remember growing up using this soap. It&#x27;s very simple and doesn&#x27;t dry you out. It&#x27;s the best green soap around at a low cost. Smells great!</li>
    <li> I love this product and I have been using this site childhood . It Keeps my skin soft.. Good deal for the price..</li>
    <li> just a regular we use and bought it as it was a free shipping day. Worth for the money we paid</li>
    <li> A gentle, cleasing soup that doesn&#x27;t get too gooey in hot humid summer.  Will always have it in the soap dish at our house.</li>
    <li> soap, smells good. cleans. great for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt; nice to get a hard to find item and get it quick. sent priority and that was unexpected.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pears Soap 56 years. It keeps my skin soft and clean feeling.  It is totally pure.</li>
    <li> I bought twelve bars because I remember Pears soap from years ago.  This is not the same soap, and I wish I had read these reviews first.  Now I have to throw $20 in the trash.</li>
    <li> Wish this had not left the shelves of all the stores, however I am really grateful that Amazon has this.  Thanks to Amazon our allergies are put at bay, and the smell is fantastic.  Also a great price, and comes right to the door.  Excellent.  This product has been around for years for a reason, my grandmother used it daily and it brings great memories.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap I have ever used. I have suffered from acne and problem skin in general since high school. I have tried different soaps over the last 15 years. This is the best soap for my skin that I have come across. Feels great, smells great and makes me look great.</li>
    <li> I love this soap because it is the only soap that I can use so far which doesn&#x27;t cause a breakout or skin rash. It seems i am allergic to the soaps in the USA. I came from UK and never had any problems with soaps until I cam here. So all in all since using this soap my skin has cleared up quite considerably.</li>
    <li> I bought some of this soap but it has a strong perfume scent that I don&#x27;t like. I would not buy it again</li>
    <li> This soap is gentle to hands, cleans well, and importantly does NOT disintegrate into mush the way some (expensive) gelatin soaps do (Neutrogena, for example).&lt;br /&gt;Now that it&#x27;s made in India, it&#x27;s not as good as it used to be: the &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; is now rather harsh, and it&#x27;s made in a cheaper way (the concave shape used to come from natural drying out of the soap after manufacture: now it&#x27;s just shaped that way in a quicker process).&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s still a great soap.</li>
    <li> Best soap I have ever found, cleans great, smells terrific.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using since I was little.  I have super sensitive skin and this is a welcome product.</li>
    <li> It smells great and makes me clean. I buy it in 12 packs. My friend Ruth told me her Dad used to use it and gave me a bar of it. I haven&#x27;t used any other bar soap since. I really do like that smell. I wish I didn&#x27;t go through a bar so quickly, though.</li>
    <li> My husband was itchy, so a Doctor told him about this soap and now we use it all the time.  Great deal online. Thanks</li>
    <li> I have beeln using this soap for a long time and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re expecting the original Pears soap, you&#x27;ll be sadly disappointed. This is a horrible reproduction that no longer has the Queens seal - most likely for good reason.  My husband says he&#x27;ll use it up, because he likes the way it leaves his skin soft - even if it does smell of petrolium. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this Indian knock-off.</li>
    <li> I thought I was ordering the Original Formula of PEARS soap, but this order arrived with the briefly manufactured (and discontinued) formulation containing chemicals, preservatives and unknown other items.  DO NOT order this if you want the original natural PEARS soap!  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used this soap for a few years now, I like how it leaves my skin feeling moisturized and rinses cleanly.  Glycerine soap is the only soap I&#x27;ll ever use.</li>
    <li> Product was just as we expected.  Very good.  Would thoroughly recommend it for it&#x27;s texture, perfect for dry skin and normal.</li>
    <li> I have used this soap all my life.  It is gentle on the skin.  I can&#x27;t find it at the drug stores anymore so will now order it.  Won&#x27;t give it up for any other soap!</li>
    <li> The Pears soap is 4.4 oz instead of 3.3 oz, but at my lcal Dollar Tree store they sell 3.3 oz pears for $1, the reason I bought this 4.4 oz package is that they ran out and I got worried.</li>
    <li> I found this soap it &amp; it was similar to neutrogena facial bar &amp; i was in a pinch. ITS great better in fact, I use this 2 times a day &amp; a moisturizer &amp; don&#x27;t have problems with zits. I converted everyone in my family to it.</li>
    <li> BEWARE. original formula for 200 years had 8 ingredients.  Now it has 24!&lt;br /&gt;it is not delightfully mild smelling or long lasting.  I urge you to research this product before buying.  I learned the hard way.  It is not what you have fond memories of.  Very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;What a bummer when I realized last night that something was very wrong with my newly opened bar of Pears.  The reason it is in cardboard box AND cellophane obviously is so that you will be tricked into buying it b/c you cannot smell it.</li>
    <li> I dont think I would ever want to be without this soap :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried other soaps but none are as gentle but thoroughly cleansing as Pears Soap</li>
    <li> This was NOT the original Pears soap as was pictured. The Pears I wanted and which I thought I had found is more pure, has fewer ingredients with no artificial colorings. The Customer Service with Amazon was outstanding. But apparently there were too many suppliers of this product, and we were not able to actually locate the Pears soap which I was hoping to purchase.</li>
    <li> On my last trip to London I had the great fortune of discovering Pears&#x27; glycerine soaps.  Unfortunately it is difficult to find in US stores. I  am very pleased to know that it is available on amazon.com through this seller. The soaps are reasonably priced, they were promptly shipped, and I didn&#x27;t have to fly back to the UK to find it!</li>
    <li> i simply love the smell and look of this soap. slightly masculine, clean and fresh.i also love the color and translucency.</li>
    <li> Initially I had a little bit of doubt on the soap quality,but when I received my order of pears soap,totally satisfied with the quality of soap.</li>
    <li> Pears&#x27;; a lifelong favorite. This offering was indeed a best buy! Thank you.</li>
    <li> This product has been a staple in our home since I was a kid.....70 years ago and I have used it daily. It has become my favorite soap after all that I have tried over the same period when this product was not available.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used pears for over 25 years.  I like it odor and I like its appearance.  One of the nice things about it is that is washes off cleanly without leaving films of soap behind.  This is something of the victorian past about ti and I feel connected each time I use it.</li>
    <li> Was disappointed  in the scent.  Ha to return it for a refund.  I did this and was  pleasantly surprised at the ease with which it was done.</li>
    <li> Pears is an old English brand of mild glycerine soap that had a lovely scent. It has been made in India for many years. I intermittently buy a new stock of 20 bars or so that last a long time. My new batch just arrived with two unfortunate changes that are probably related. First, the box now proudly says made by Unilever (the giant multi national). Second the scent has been changed. It is a much stronger medicinal scent that is moderately unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember the new Coke formula? I assume this is another bone head change by a new corporate owner to a wonderful product with a loyal following. Unless they change back it will be my last purchase of Pears soap.</li>
    <li> The formula has been changed, and for the better because it cleans better and lasts longer.  The scent is a matter of personal preference When I ran out of the old bars, which I purchased in quantity, a friend gave me one of the new ones.  I liked it and promptly ordered a quantity.  If you are ambivalent after reading conflicting reviews, buy a single bar at a local store before ordering from Amazon at a very good price.</li>
    <li> I only use this soap and it&#x27;s a very convenient way to order at a great price.</li>
