### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great.</li>
      <li>Great product at a GREAT SAVINGS.  </li>
      <li>Best price with all the right vitamins for my eyes. !!</li>
      <li>Good product prescribed by my doctor.</li>
      <li>Good price, rapid delivery, no problems.  </li>
      <li>so I feel very confident taking the capsules.</li>
      <li>I am a diabetic and this product is effective in preventive care.  </li>
      <li>True!!</li>
      <li>So wonderful to find a vitamin for vision that I only have to take one time a day!</li>
      <li>I am sure that&lt;br</li>
      <li>Capsule has plastic smell and is quite large, but you save a good bit of money vs. Presser Vision</li>
      <li>Her vision has improved greatly, and the Pro-Optic AREDS 2 seemed to speed the improvement, however, I have gotten Bausch &amp; Lomb formula which is the same dosage but taken twice a day instead of continuing with this product.</li>
      <li>NIH found a problem with the original formulation for smokers; it contained beta carotene, which was linked to cancer in smokers.</li>
      <li>very pleased, since my eye doctor prescribed the areds 2 and the Pro Optics requires only 1 a day instead of 2.</li>
      <li>thanks !!</li>
      <li>Why I don&#x27;t give it five stars is because it will be a long time until I know whether it will be effective in preventing the progression of macular degeneration.</li>
      <li>The order was shipped promptly and exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>Are they good or a waste of money?</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the reminder when it is time to re-order.</li>
      <li>All the ingredients my eye doctor recommended at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I use it, but really can&#x27;t tell if it is doing anything for me.</li>
      <li>This product is superior to a previous supplement I used because it requires only one daily pill.</li>
      <li>This is the exact formulation that the research study recommended so I got it for my mother who has macular degeneration and is having her eye injected regularly.</li>
      <li>therefore my rating of five stars is not accurate, but I am sure he will like the P-O because one PO per day takes the place of the current 2 pills twice a day.</li>
      <li>She was happy for the product of equal potency and less expensive than name brand AREDS 2.  </li>
      <li>He had a large supply of the other pills so he is continuing to use up those before starting on the PRO-OPTIC...</li>

    <li> This is the exact formulation that the research study recommended so I got it for my mother who has macular degeneration and is having her eye injected regularly. I thought it would be easier for her to remember one pill a day rather than two. However after taking it for a month with her lunch, her esophagus started hurting, even when she took Tums with it. Her vision has improved greatly, and the Pro-Optic AREDS 2 seemed to speed the improvement, however, I have gotten Bausch &amp; Lomb formula which is the same dosage but taken twice a day instead of continuing with this product.</li>
    <li> Great. My eye DR. Said use them, and I am.</li>
    <li> Need the Pro-Optic because of the beginning of macular degeneration. They have an odd odor and sometimes&lt;br /&gt;an aftertaste, not pleasant, comes into one&#x27;s mouth. But, they are needed to help the eyes. Agree!!! True!!</li>
    <li> very pleased, since my eye doctor prescribed the areds 2 and the Pro Optics requires only 1 a day instead of 2.</li>
    <li> Just what the doctor ordered.</li>
    <li> All the ingredients my eye doctor recommended at a reasonable price. I am sure that&lt;br /&gt;that this will not cure my macular degeneration but it seems to be slowing the progression. Somewhat of a plastic odor .</li>
    <li> Best price with all the right vitamins for my eyes. !! ------------ thanks !! ------------ rp.</li>
    <li> Great product at a GREAT SAVINGS.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I use it, but really can&#x27;t tell if it is doing anything for me. My eye doctor suggested using this product, so I am. Guess time will tell.</li>
    <li> Good product prescribed by my doctor.</li>
    <li> What i like about this product is that it contains all of the chemicals recommended by NIH&#x27;s 2013 study of arresting macular degeneration. This product is superior to a previous supplement I used because it requires only one daily pill. The previous product required two daily. Note that AREDS 2 is recommended for people who smoke or who have ever smoked. NIH found a problem with the original formulation for smokers; it contained beta carotene, which was linked to cancer in smokers. Why I don&#x27;t give it five stars is because it will be a long time until I know whether it will be effective in preventing the progression of macular degeneration.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using another OTC brand of eye pills because he has age-related macular degeneration. At his last appointment the ophthalmologist gave him samples of PRO-OPTIC and suggested that he take PO instead of the current pills. He had a large supply of the other pills so he is continuing to use up those before starting on the PRO-OPTIC...therefore my rating of five stars is not accurate, but I am sure he will like the P-O because one PO per day takes the place of the current 2 pills twice a day. With the other medications he takes, he says that some days he feels that lunch is made up of pills!</li>
    <li> So wonderful to find a vitamin for vision that I only have to take one time a day! Recommended by my optometrist!</li>
    <li> The AREDS-2 formula was recommended by my eye doctor, and I find that this product is not only less expensive than other OTC eye vitamins, but only required one per day and was much smaller than the four-daily competitors.  It is supposed to ward off macular degeneration.  We shall see.</li>
    <li> Are they good or a waste of money? It will take several months to find outl. I will be seeing my&lt;br /&gt;doctor in January and he will tell me if the Areds 2 are helping.</li>
    <li> Good price, rapid delivery, no problems.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> The order was shipped promptly and exactly as described.  This product was recommended by my doctor so I feel very confident taking the capsules.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the reminder when it is time to re-order.</li>
    <li> To soon to tell.  My vision care Dr. Advised me to take this .  I am a diabetic and this product is effective in preventive care.  If u are not going to take his advise , why do u go to h ???</li>
    <li> She was happy for the product of equal potency and less expensive than name brand AREDS 2.  We will know in time whether it helps her progression of macular degeneration???</li>
    <li> Advertising is a bit deceptive. Although this product does contain all the recommended ingredients, they are NOT at the same level as used in the AREDS2 study. For example, AREDS2 tested 1000 mg of omega 3 fatty acids, but this product has ONLY 100 mg. AREDS2 formula contains 400 IU Vitamin E, but this product has ONLY 300 IU. Buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t care about these shortcomings in the formula, this product does have the advantage of being cheaper and requiring only one capsule per day.</li>
    <li> Capsule has plastic smell and is quite large, but you save a good bit of money vs. Presser Vision</li>
    <li> On-time deliver and product is as described. AREDS 2 formula is what was suggested by my optometrist.</li>
