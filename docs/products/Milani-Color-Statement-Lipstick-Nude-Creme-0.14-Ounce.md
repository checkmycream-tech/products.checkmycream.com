    <li> Love love love it!!! I bought mine at Walgreens and it&#x27;s the best nice lipstick color!!</li>
    <li> On time! Beautiful color</li>
    <li> I like the Milani products and my favorite is no longer available.  This color is very light, even on me and my skin is pretty fair.</li>
    <li> Love the color. Somewhat drying though.</li>
    <li> Liked the color and wear of this the one time that I wore it. Have not worn it since because it has an unpleasant smell and taste.</li>
    <li> Lovely color.  Its the perfect peach nude. Harder to see on pigmented lips though. I just have to apply 3 layers.</li>
    <li> The color looks decent on my skintone. Wish it was more long lasting but if you mix it with gloss, it works better I think.</li>
    <li> Beautiful shade, color pay off is nice! Pair it with a eyeliner or a smoky . It will look very pretty. Smells good and packaging is pretty.</li>
    <li> All Milani lipsticks are amazing! Quality as good as Mac and they smell like Mac as well! This color looks great on everyone!</li>
    <li> Nothing special, save your money and go with Make Up Forever nude lipsticks.</li>
    <li> I took a chance with this (you never know what something really looks like when you buy it online based off of YouTube videos), and WOW. It&#x27;s such a gorgeous color. I am very fair-skinned/pale, with naturally very pigmented pink lips. I wanted a nude that wouldn&#x27;t wash me out and also complimented my natural lips. This lipstick, beyond the beautiful color, is so creamy and smooth. The application is wonderful. It has a nice scent, but may be too much for very sensitive people. I love this lipstick!</li>

    <li> This lipstick is a brownish dark beige color, with no trace of pink as shown in the picture. It is indeed light if your lips are dark.

    <li> Believe the hype!  This is the perfect natural pink nude (doesn&#x27;t wash you out!)  It&#x27;s creamy and opaque and just a perfect shade to pick when you don&#x27;t know what color to wear!  The formula is somewhat moisturizing - and I don&#x27;t have to apply a lip balm underneath.  Out performs the department store brands (trust me, I worked at one of the Big 3) that sell for close to $30 a tube.  Yes, you can save your cash and still look like a million bucks!  Try this line - there are a ton of colors so if this one doesn&#x27;t suit you, you can try another shade!:)</li>
    <li> Meh....just okay. Has an odd smell/taste. I don&#x27;t hate the color, but I don&#x27;t love it either. It&#x27;s a bit too light for my lips since they naturally have more color.</li>
    <li> Lipstick has an unpleasant odor, but the color is nice. Sent quickly.</li>
    <li> Pretty soft color, as advertised</li>
