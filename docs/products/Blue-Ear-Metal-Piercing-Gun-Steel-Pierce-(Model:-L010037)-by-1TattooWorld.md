      <li>at first i was hesitant but im glad i made the decision of buying it!</li>
      <li>easy to use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still very pleased with the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it really doesn&#x27;t say what comes with the gun in the description, here&#x27;s an inventory:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>cheap and easy to use.</li>
      <li>maybe one day I&#x27;ll find earrings that will fit in it.</li>
      <li>and they didn&#x27;t come with any earrings or directions on what earrings would fit, but it was $8</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s not such a great idea until the site is healed, because you&#x27;re tempting infection and scar</li>
      <li>its so cheap</li>
      <li>I changed mine out in a week for better, more stylish studs to complete my healing time.</li>
      <li>if it&#x27;s your first time,  I might suggest having a trusted friend do it for you as it is kind of tricky to line things up right</li>

      <li>The very first time we used this we realized the plastic was very cheap and did not hold the trigger in place very well.</li>

      <li>found the product inexpensive, easy to use, and effective - overall</li>
      <li>, I would not advise anyone to use the included studs they are cheaply made, the bend when they hit the skin they will only leave someone with a scar.invest in your own studs</li>
      <li>ya its cheap, but it don&amp;#34;t even pierce straight, so watch out</li>
      <li>The gun works fine, But the main problem i have is with the studs it came with.</li>
      <li>The blue ear piercing work fine!</li>
      <li>It puts the stud in very fast.</li>
      <li>Youll regret using this, you will most likely misplace your piercing</li>
      <li>First, while all of the information on this listing indicates the gun comes with studs included we received no studs.</li>
      <li>Let me first say that you can&#x27;t beat the price of this item.</li>
      <li>&quot; Make sure that the outer part of the sight is on the back of the lobe.&lt;br</li>
      <li>&quot; Make sure that the outer part of the sight is on the back of the lobe.&lt;br</li>
      <li>the pen broke the first time i tried to use it</li>
      <li>tissue.&lt;br /&gt;*update - 1 month after piercing (01/05/2013) the hole has healed enough that I can swap out other types of earrings, which is nice because the original stainless piercing stud was getting a little scuzzy.&lt;br /&gt;Keeping the site clean and free from contamination is important to avoid infection - I highly recommend saline nasal spray (yes, nasal spray) for cleaning and flushing the site.  </li>
      <li>the only thing i wouldve changed is the color but other than that i love it. : )</li>
      <li>The studs that come with it are absolute trash</li>
      <li>It worked really well.</li>
      <li>4mm stainless steel piercing studs&lt;br /&gt;100 plastic (silicone?)</li>
      <li>it came fast with prime shipping.</li>
      <li>this piece of equiment could really damage yourself.</li>
      <li>you SHOULD NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES use the studs in the pack unless you get metal backs and sterilize them the gun works really well</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle and nonirritating.</li>
      <li>I think the salt in the saline was corroding stainless stud because it had lost it&#x27;s luster.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Ok enough to pierce yourself, or someone at home, but is not by any means a professional piercing gun.</li>
      <li>you really need your uvula pierced, please pay the extra money and get it done by a reputable professional.</li>
      <li>you really need your uvula pierced, please pay the extra money and get it done by a reputable professional.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s a lot of factors that can affect healing times, but I actually had better luck with this gun for piercing fleshy lobe than I did with a professional piercer.</li>
      <li>cheaply made, not lined up to be accurate, and has many little crevices to make it hard to properly clean.</li>
      <li>Does what its suppost to very easy to use need instructions in the box but its not that hard to figure out well worth the money</li>
      <li>*update 2 - 2 months after initial piercing, I have a bit of advice: keep the piercing clean with a gentle cleaner and LEAVE IT ALONE.  </li>
      <li>you are steady handed and don&#x27;t have an overactive flinch, you can do this yourself (I did).</li>
      <li>you are steady handed and don&#x27;t have an overactive flinch, you can do this yourself (I did).</li>
      <li>and i relised the plastic was cheap and you can really hurt someone cuz the trigger is directly connected to the needle if you arent careful.</li>
      <li>like many of the other people said the earring doesnt connect to the back</li>
      <li>It also was received with a large crack in the plastic casing of the gun, which may have occurred in shipping as it was not well packed at all (wrapped in plastic and loose in a box that was too large).</li>
      <li>The build leaves the gun slightly wobbly when you go to pull the trigger (the plastic halves arent totally secure together)</li>
      <li>gently place the earring back on the exposed stud tip.  </li>

      <li>If you&#x27;re not careful, you can hurt someone because the trigger is directly connected to the \\&quot;needle\\&quot;</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t shoot accurately, sends the needle off a little bit so it doesn&#x27;t go through the back piece for the earring.</li>
      <li>make sure you get someone to help you as it is very hard to get the gun to pierce your ear</li>
      <li>Originally, the hole was still giving me trouble after 2 months and I ultimately had to let it heal.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great quality merchandise. Sturdy and spot on aim with the studs that come with it because they are fitted specifically for this device. Though they are not the best quality, you should use them for safe accurate piercing. I changed mine out in a week for better, more stylish studs to complete my healing time. Using this device was less expensive to re-do my ears then going to the shop but always remember your aftercare!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to pierce myself and my friends. I used studex studs to pierce and it works great! one thing i dont like about is i need to push really hard to pierce</li>
    <li> The earring and back DO NOT LINE UP!! BIG PROBLEM</li>
    <li> Let me first say that you can&#x27;t beat the price of this item. That being said, you get what you pay for. The gun is built ok. Ok enough to pierce yourself, or someone at home, but is not by any means a professional piercing gun. The build leaves the gun slightly wobbly when you go to pull the trigger (the plastic halves arent totally secure together) But my girlfriend and I pierced each other&#x27;s ears in multiple places with no issue. You will want to go get some earring backs made out of metal... the silicone ones that come with the gun are worthless for piercing.</li>
    <li> The very first time we used this we realized the plastic was very cheap and did not hold the trigger in place very well. If you&#x27;re not careful, you can hurt someone because the trigger is directly connected to the \\&quot;needle\\&quot; that&#x27;s supposed to go into the back, and instead it can catch on the metal clip and not pierce the ear all the way.</li>
    <li> The gun works fine, But the main problem i have is with the studs it came with. It came with 24 studs, (ten-20g eleven-18 and three-16g?) i have no idea why the uneven amount. There was also flat edges on the post with some of them so please look closely before use. I would recommend buying a set of 4mm studs separately.</li>
    <li> Does what its suppost to very easy to use need instructions in the box but its not that hard to figure out well worth the money</li>
    <li> SO i got it in the mail and i was looking at the gun and i relised the plastic was cheap and you can really hurt someone cuz the trigger is directly connected to the needle if you arent careful. and second of all i pulled back the knob on the back and its stuck and i cant find the button to pierce the ear. i wish there was directions to use the gun.</li>
    <li> I got it in the mail, it works wonderfully. at first i was hesitant but im glad i made the decision of buying it! you wont regret it. the only thing i wouldve changed is the color but other than that i love it. : )</li>
    <li> First, while all of the information on this listing indicates the gun comes with studs included we received no studs. The gun is worthless without the studs. It also was received with a large crack in the plastic casing of the gun, which may have occurred in shipping as it was not well packed at all (wrapped in plastic and loose in a box that was too large). Could not use it, waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> The blue ear piercing work fine!</li>
    <li> This breaks so very easily I never got to use it</li>
    <li> cheaply made, not lined up to be accurate, and has many little crevices to make it hard to properly clean.</li>
    <li> That is excactly what I was expecting. It worked really well. I like and enjoy my pierced ears!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t shoot accurately, sends the needle off a little bit so it doesn&#x27;t go through the back piece for the earring. WHAT THE EFF.&lt;br /&gt;so i&#x27;ve had it for like 4 months now and i still haven&#x27;t tried it yet on myself or anyone cuz i&#x27;m a little worried.&lt;br /&gt;not impressed at all. spare yourself the dough and go to claire&#x27;s or something.</li>
    <li> the gun itself worked well.it does peirce, i does serve its purpose.however, I would not advise anyone to use the included studs they are cheaply made, the bend when they hit the skin they will only leave someone with a scar.invest in your own studs</li>
    <li> this worked amazing. when i got it i thought \\&quot;wow is is little will it work?\\&quot; but i disinfected everything and it shot into my cartilage. It works really good i didnt even know it went throught. i would recommend this! i have to re-pierce it thought because my cat jumped of and hurt it so much the back came off, and it fell out. :( but i will do it again!</li>
    <li> ovr all the gun gets the job done but... very hard to do yourself make sure you get someone to help you as it is very hard to get the gun to pierce your ear</li>
    <li> I wish I didnt buy this.. I was so excited to get it but its so cheap I dont think Im ever going to use it. It doesnt even work.. I think Im going to send it back and just go somewhere and pay 10 buck..Doesnt hold the earrings in place.. Read the  reviews.. Save yorself some time and money.</li>
    <li> cheap and easy to use. once i got it. multiple people asked me to pierce their ears.. it even came with piercing studs. if you go to sallys, your gonna pay like 100 for this. i paid 10. ftw</li>
    <li> this piece of equiment could really damage yourself. ya its cheap, but it don&amp;#34;t even pierce straight, so watch out</li>
    <li> I was expecting an all metal gun. The blue part is plastic. Usage is self-explanatory. Worked smoothly and quickly. So end result of piercing was good. I also expected metal earring backings. This was a surprise but not a problem. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting an inexpensive alternative for just a few piercings.</li>
    <li> guess I didn&#x27;t know what I needed when I bought this gun because the earrings I had from a previous piercing would not fit in this gun and they didn&#x27;t come with any earrings or directions on what earrings would fit, but it was $8 so I&#x27;m not too worried about it maybe one day I&#x27;ll find earrings that will fit in it. lol</li>
    <li> earrings that come with this are crappy quality and they irritate several others skin. the gun came and it never worked. the mirrior that came inside the package in pieces when it came and the pen broke the first time i tried to use it</li>
    <li> When I got it, I put a stud in it that came with it (you get a lot of very low quality gold colored studs with it) and shot it just to see how it worked. The stud broke. So I tried again and the same thing happened. I put the stud in a different way and tried again and it worked. When you put the stud in, you have to put the back in the farther away spot it could go from the actual stud. The studs that come with it are absolute trash and I recommend throwing them away. The gun is very easy to clean and sterilize. It doesn&#x27;t hurt when you pull the trigger. It puts the stud in very fast. Unfortunately, when you pull the trigger until it puts the stud and the back close together before the spring fires it to put it through your ear, the stud is still a bit far away from your ear, making it a little hard to line up where you want it. But all in all it is a great gun for a great price.</li>
    <li> It Worked great. It took me a bit to get the ering and the backing lined up but it workes great.</li>
    <li> The gun came in it&#x27;s own case which was nice. However when we tried to pierce my ears, the gun went through the ear and the earring back kept getting jammed in the gun. We had to keep manually wrestling the earring off the gun and manually putting the back on. I wish I had never bought it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Did what it was supposed to. My ear was pierced easily with one shot, and has healed nicely. This is a great product at decent price.</li>
    <li> like many of the other people said the earring doesnt connect to the back and I had to use pliers because the metal earring would not come out. it! was stuck in the ear in the gun! ouch! i will be returning it..i got what i paid for....it was a small torture device... please pay closer attention.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to do my own piercing&lt;br /&gt;It came with no instructions what so ever. I don&#x27;t know how to use it. I think im going to send it back...</li>
    <li> i would not recommend this item to anyone, this ear piercing gun did not work. it is  WASTE of money. it WONT pierce your ear.</li>
    <li> the trigger sticks a bit and you SHOULD NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES use the studs in the pack unless you get metal backs and sterilize them the gun works really well though if you know how to use it</li>
    <li> Nope, use a needle for your own good. Youll regret using this, you will most likely misplace your piercing</li>
    <li> well the gun gets stuck when i pierced through the ear. it also snaggs on a piece of skin so not very good</li>
    <li> Product as described. Works as described.Price was excellent.I would purchase again. I would recommend to ours.Used product over and over again.</li>
    <li> The gun is \\&quot;okay\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The studs SUCK. The studs should be sufficient enough to be used for at least 2-3 weeks.. and hypoallergenic at that. But not so. The studs included made my piercing swollen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to test, I used the studs in my other ear piercings.. which my lobes below had been pierced since I was a year old. They too became infected. Irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the gun is okay and did an alright job. I pierced my aunts ears and she was pleased with the results aside from the red/itchy feeling she got as well.</li>
    <li> *update 2 - 2 months after initial piercing, I have a bit of advice: keep the piercing clean with a gentle cleaner and LEAVE IT ALONE.  I keep messing with it, swapping earrings and aggravating the site.  When I leave it alone it&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;m impatient and wanted to try other earrings and that&#x27;s not such a great idea until the site is healed, because you&#x27;re tempting infection and scar tissue.&lt;br /&gt;*update - 1 month after piercing (01/05/2013) the hole has healed enough that I can swap out other types of earrings, which is nice because the original stainless piercing stud was getting a little scuzzy.&lt;br /&gt;Keeping the site clean and free from contamination is important to avoid infection - I highly recommend saline nasal spray (yes, nasal spray) for cleaning and flushing the site.  It&#x27;s gentle and nonirritating. Be careful with alcohol and peroxide as they can irritate the site and cause healing to take longer.  I used peroxide about once every 1-2 weeks and saline almost daily. I think the salt in the saline was corroding stainless stud because it had lost it&#x27;s luster.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a lot of factors that can affect healing times, but I actually had better luck with this gun for piercing fleshy lobe than I did with a professional piercer. Originally, the hole was still giving me trouble after 2 months and I ultimately had to let it heal. I&#x27;m still very pleased with the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it really doesn&#x27;t say what comes with the gun in the description, here&#x27;s an inventory:&lt;br /&gt;1 blue piercing gun&lt;br /&gt;1 felt tip pen&lt;br /&gt;1 small round mirror&lt;br /&gt;100 4mm stainless steel piercing studs&lt;br /&gt;100 plastic (silicone?) backs&lt;br /&gt;1 plastic case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;d think the use of this device would be self explanatory, but I found myself a bit puzzled upon examining the gun.  I looked up the procedure online and found a wealth of info.  Here&#x27;s the lowdown:&lt;br /&gt;1) sanitize everything by either boiling or thoroughly wiping down with alcohol or similar antiseptic (don&#x27;t forget to wash your hands)&lt;br /&gt;2) mark the place on your lobe that you want to pierce with the included felt tip pen.&lt;br /&gt;3) cock the gun by pulling back the metal \\&quot;hammer\\&quot; on the back of the gun until it clicks.&lt;br /&gt;4) carefully place one of the included piercing studs in the hole of the gun with the point out (duh)&lt;br /&gt;5) place the area to be pierced in between the piercing stud and the metal \\&quot;sight.\\&quot; Make sure that the outer part of the sight is on the back of the lobe.&lt;br /&gt;6) line up the dot in the sight, make sure the gun is level, and gently pull the trigger.  *pop* you&#x27;re pierced!&lt;br /&gt;7) gently place the earring back on the exposed stud tip.  The plastic ones provided are ok, but I used a metal backing from another earring set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are steady handed and don&#x27;t have an overactive flinch, you can do this yourself (I did). if it&#x27;s your first time,  I might suggest having a trusted friend do it for you as it is kind of tricky to line things up right yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the product inexpensive, easy to use, and effective - overall a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and please only use this to pierce your fleshy lobes - piercing cartilage  with a gun can lead to cracked cartilage, infection, pain and woe. Please also don&#x27;t try using this on anything other than your ears . . .if you really need your uvula pierced, please pay the extra money and get it done by a reputable professional. By all means, PLEASE do not use this gun to pierce anything on your body that is often used in a sexual way (like your tongue, for instance) DEFINITELY leave that to the pros.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this 5 stars had it had an instruction pamphlet.rget to wash your hands)&lt;br /&gt;2) mark the place on your lobe that you want to pierce with the included felt tip pen.&lt;br /&gt;3) cock the gun by pulling back the metal \\&quot;hammer\\&quot; on the back of the gun until it clicks.&lt;br /&gt;4) carefully place one of the included piercing studs in the hole of the gun with the point out (duh)&lt;br /&gt;5) place the area to be pierced in between the piercing stud and the metal \\&quot;sight.\\&quot; Make sure that the outer part of the sight is on the back of the lobe.&lt;br /&gt;6) line up the dot in the sight, make sure the gun is level, and gently pull the trigger.  *pop* you&#x27;re pierced!&lt;br /&gt;7) gently place the earring back on the exposed stud tip.
