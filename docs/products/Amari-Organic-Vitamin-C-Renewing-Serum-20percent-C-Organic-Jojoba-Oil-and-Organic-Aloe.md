<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent, well priced product. I mist my face lightly with Evian before applying 5-6 drops all over my face &amp; neck. This is to enable the hyaluronic acid to bond with my skin. HA holds up to 1,000 times its&#x27; weight on water. The high concentration of vitamin C, along with vitamin E and ferulic acid, make this a great, go to serum. Note, if you use Retin-A or similar, use this product during the day &amp; apply the Retin-A in the evening. Don&#x27;t forget to use sunscreen daily.</li>
    <li> I love it and will be buying more before this runs out! Im loving my new glow and my dark spots are fading away. Im going to post Before and after pics soon..</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS VITAMIN C SERUM</li>
    <li> Saw difference the first week...</li>
    <li> Excellent fot the face and neck</li>
    <li> Good product...works as advertised.</li>
    <li> loved it i was a bit skeptical about using a product with no reviews but i have to say its wonderful the spray bottle was genius i would have gave five but like the previous reviews it doubled in price after recommending to my co workers..the refused to spend that much oh well</li>
    <li> I really like the spray bottle.  It works great!  The product is light and refreshing.  It  doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell which is great.  After it dried I could definitely feel that my skin was tighter.  It absorbs  to quickly which makes it easy apply make up over the top.  Unlike other similar products I have tried, this did not leave my face feeling sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has \\&quot;No BHA/BHT, No CI&#x27;s, No DEA, No Dibutyl phthalate, No Formaldehyde, No Parabens, No Parfume, No PEG compounds, No Petrolatum, No Siloxanes, No Sodium laureth sulfate, No Triclosan.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product also contains Organic Aloe Vera, Organic Gotu Kola, Organic Horsetail, Organic Geranium, and Organic Dandelion.  These ingredients provide many benefits including antioxidant protection, hydration, healing, reducing inflammation and reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product daily for a few weeks and I can see a noticeable difference in my dark sun spots.  It also has seemed to brighten and even out my skin tone and has reduced the redness on my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product in exchange for an unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Very liked&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent !!</li>
    <li> This is just to buy&lt;br /&gt;My choice is not wrong very good</li>
    <li> My skin didn&#x27;t know what is was missing until I started using this serum. It&#x27;s nice having a serum that is Organic plus Vitamin C. I&#x27;ve experienced good results with Vitamin C creams and toners so giving this chance to try out a serum that has it as well is just what I needed in my life. I have noticed as i get older, more problems have been happening with my face. My skin and neck hasn&#x27;t felt this soft in a long time.</li>
    <li> Ok, I was going to leave a glowing review: An effective serum at a reasonable price. However, I&#x27;ve noticed the price has gone up $10 since I purchased it. Huh? While it is as effective as the other serums, the price increase will impact my choice the next time I consider purchasing a vitamin C serum.</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly and in good condition. It is not what I think of as a serum, but more of a watery spray, even after shaking the product well. The most disappointing thing is the odor of vanilla that follows me like a cloud when I use it. If it were unscented, I might be able to deal with the watery consistency. But I cannot live with the aroma and will be returning this product.</li>
    <li> Product smells nice. So far, I feel like it is very hydrating for the skin. I am used to Vitamin C on my skin and have not noticed much improvement in tone. I purchased this for the Hyaluronic Acid content to help keep skin hydrated in winter - has been helpful so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that I do not like the spray pump and would much prefer a dropper, since I like to pat the product into the skin. Spray does get product into eyes, which burns (product label also says avoid contact with eyes, which is hard when you have a sprayer). I have been spraying this into my hands and then applying to my face. Again, a dropper would be more beneficial to this than they sprayer which also causes the product to get everywhere when spraying into hands. Gave this three stars because of the inconvenient packaging. I would repurchase if the packaging changes.</li>
    <li> I cannot live without my Vitamin C Serum, as it helps with my fine lines, discoloration and dry patches! I use it under a night time repair cream at night and an SPF moisturizer in the mornings…and I cannot believe how big of a difference it makes! I am in my mid thirties so I am an aficionado of anti aging serums/creams and products that will shield my skin from harmful radicals. This serum has been delivering the results that I want/need!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> I have tried several Vitamin C Serums and found this one does not dry out the skin.  I use it twice a day and I feel that my skin has improved greatly.  At 70, I have minor wrinkles and soft skin.  Will keep on buying.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with customer service! Just started using it and so far the product is good and as advertised!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell to much differance .&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 14 days. I have learned that a product is not going to be fast results. In order to give a product it just time you must give it the full 14 days to 30 days to work. Now that I have done that I can say that .. The serum is in a syringe bulb style bottle. If you use a full dropper full you can use any extra down your neck and chest. It is suggested to go down the neck. I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience! The neck on men and women is one of the first ways to tell aging process. I also use what is left on my finger tips on the back of my hands. I since using this product. I am noticing more hydration to my skin and it looks brighter. To me I am noticing some tightening in the skin too. I always love finding a product that is healthier for your skin. The has great ingredients that are organic and herbal. Which is currently the in thing to be using. I am observing light sun spots. Not gone but lighting up some.</li>
    <li> I started by using samples of a more expensive product recommended by my dermatologist.  Since I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend almost $100 a bottle, I compared ingredients with less expensive brands, this being one of them.  This product is very effective in my opinion.  It has helped with acne and it has also given my facial skin an overall glow/healthy look to it.  I have used this for about 6 months, and I plan on continuing.</li>
    <li> This was my first vitamin C. I am not a fan of the spray pump. The bottle has lasted me 6 weeks. I also didn&#x27;t care the yellowish, not clear solution. It has a decent scent. I should finish my bottle this week. I apply morning and evening. I must admit it took me about 2 weeks to notice a difference. My face is brighter and radiance. It haven&#x27;t noticed much with my dark spots. All in all, I like it. I will try other brands and see how they compare. I am of dark complexion.</li>
    <li> I feel good because of this product.&lt;br /&gt;Already people find out the change in my face.&lt;br /&gt;The evaluation of the skin increased steadily better people.&lt;br /&gt;The day can feel the change differently.&lt;br /&gt;So effective is the fastest product for the first time. I really recommend it.</li>
    <li> So good, feel much younger</li>
    <li> really helpful for skin care.</li>
    <li> Love this. I love the thickness of it too compared to other serums I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
    <li> very good, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Thank you for the Vitamin C gel. I love the consistency of it! It doesn&#x27;t really smell which is fine with me. Vitamin C tends to be kinda sticky in higher doses, or doses without water which are runny and worthless. I love the way my face feels after I put it on. Thank you for following up with me via emails to remind me that my product is coming and directions for use, too bad more sellers don&#x27;t interact with their buyers.Thanks again!!</li>
    <li> So far, I really like this serum. However, I haven&#x27;t had it very long so that&#x27;s why I only gave 4 stars. Shipping was fast. I hope to review after I&#x27;ve had this for at least 30 days</li>
    <li> Unsure.. Think it broke me out</li>
    <li> love seen skin inprove almost overnight</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past. Everything is as  I expected.</li>
    <li> Great serum for great price. I had been eyeing several serums at the drugstore and cosmetic counters however never knew what to try because they all come with a hefty price and I would be pissed if it didn&#x27;t work. However I was watching a youtuber ranting about all the natural oils she loved to use on the skin and all the benefits they contained and she mentioned this serum. I had heard of the great benefits from using vitamin c and at this great price I was more inclined to give it a try. The fact that this is an organic product assured me that its less likely to have a crazy skin reaction as my skin can be sensitive. This product is pretty good. So far have used only a couple of times so no results to report so far. This serum is more liquidy in consistency than others serums I have previously tried.</li>
    <li> Lovveeeeee ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ This product really does wrk</li>
    <li> I am so sick of the dishonest reviews on Amazon which seem to be growing. It has become extremely hard to trust reviews anymore. I have been reading through the reviews and comments for this product, so far I have uncovered at least ten 4 and 5 star reviews where the customer admits to receiving the product in exchange for a review. HOWEVER these reviews are all labeled as &amp;#34;Verified Purchases&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t know if companies like this one have found a way around that or Amazon just makes it easy for anyone to say something was a verified purchase.</li>
    <li> So far, I am really liking this serum! It doesn&#x27;t really have much of a scent to it. It is not sticky at all, it goes on very well and absorbs wonderfully. A little goes a long way! You only need a few drops to rub on your whole face. The instructions say to test 1st for skin irritation,  since it is 20% vit c, but I had no problem at all. It may have felt a little tingly for a few seconds, that was it. I have a dark spot on my cheek, so I am excited to see if this fades it! I&#x27;ve only used it 3 days, but I&#x27;m sure this will be part of my skin routine from now on!</li>
    <li> Really like this under my bb cream</li>
    <li> I like my daily routine to be quick so I like to use this serum as it is easy to apply and use, I just spritz it on and use it like a toner. It goes on my face after I cleanse and if I need to add moisturizer I add some then I spritz on the serum and go do my hair, after it dries I apply my make-up and I am ready for the day. It helps diminish fine lines and wrinkles and adds a cushion between my skin and my make-up so it doesn&#x27;t settle into my fine lines while reducing their appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love what vitamin c does for my skin. It really helps to even the tone and texture of my skin. I see a reduction in blemishes as well. It has been known to brightens and smooths the skin for a more radiant and youthful complexion, potent antioxidants neutralize free radicals to block, reverse sun damage, erase sun spots and discoloration. However, I did find that to be true but I also found it to be more than just an anti-aging serum. In addition to its powerful anti-aging properties, I have found that this vitamin c serum has helped to shrink my pores, clear up my acne, prevent future breakouts, and minimize the appearance of my old acne scars.I would recommend this product to everyone who wants a healthier complexion. I recieved this product for my unbiased review, and although I I got it for free all thoughts, ideas and words expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> This product is helping my skin.  A rough  patch which the Derma tried to remove has almost gone away thanks to this product.  Sure it&#x27;s a little drying.  To counteract this, I mix with a little bit of Emu Oil.  I don&#x27;t know about the wrinkles yet as maybe it&#x27;s just too early too tell.  I&#x27;m about a month into this, day and night application, so I will use until it runs out.  If I see improvement in the wrinkles around my eyes and on top of my lip line, I will definitely purchase again.  I am not crazy about the dropper application and would love to see a pump.  Overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> Saw no difference in skin</li>
    <li> Not at all what was expecting</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about 3 days now and I have seen quite a difference! I actually applied it on a a couple of inflamed spots at night and by the next morning it has reduced in size and has become less visible. I am really liking what I&#x27;m seeing right now and I look forward to see how it will help with my acne scars after dermarolling.  Thank you for an awesome product! I&#x27;ll probably edit this review after I start dermarolling and applying this product.  ***UPDATE 8/8/15!!*** Been using this serum consistently for about 2 months now and have seen a considerable difference in my skin. I break out less, my face is naturally radiant, and I have an even skin tone since using this product. I have also applied this serum after dermarolling on July 13 and my acne scars have become less deep since the treatment. I plan on dermarolling again next week while using this product. I can not believe how much this product has changed the look of my skin; it is a life saver! Definitely recommend for it&#x27;s quality and reasonable price!</li>
    <li> this is the best Vitamin C  Serum I have ever used. I am a 67 year old woman . With in about  almost 2 weeks I can see the difference in my skin. I use it x2 a day and after using my derm roller. A  little goes a.long way. It is a quality product for afford price. Thanks Amazon for carrying  such a good product. I will be ordering again soon.</li>
    <li> I use many different brand of Vitamin C serum for years.  This one is very good and easy to absorb into my skin and even my skin tone. I use around 3 week and see the improvement in my skin. Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing , by the end of my first week I noticed a huge improvement in skin texture , every day gets better ... Fantastic , fave new go to skin care . So good that I&#x27;ve already ordered 2 more bottles . George</li>
    <li> I tried this serum after reading about it on the xovain beauty blog, and I gotta say I&#x27;m impressed. I have sensitive skin and this product hasn&#x27;t aggravated it in the least! Additionally I&#x27;m noticing a change in the texture and brightness of my skin after starting to use it twice daily for a little over a week. I also like the consistency of this serum it is more watery than oily and feels light on the skin. Definitely a great purchase and a great price!</li>
    <li> So far I have bought two of these. First one i was pretty impressed by the reduction of fine lines, I&#x27;ve had to deal with cystic acne and i feel that when i put this on at night the next morning i wake with smoother skin, and less inflammation. Easy to put on and quickly absorbed in the skin. When i got my second bottle i became lazy and forgot to use it but just this week i started again and same great results. Smoother skin, and less flareups. I will probably buy a third soon.</li>
    <li> Very highly desirable.</li>
    <li> I have just ordered my second bottle of Amari Organic Vitamin C Renewing Serum. This stuff really works! Like REALLY! You may or may not see it for yourself because it is subtle on a day to day basis. But people who know you and see you infrequently will notice. I have had so many people say - What are you doing? Did you change your makeup? Your face looks different!&lt;br /&gt;I have notice my skin is a bit tighter at the jaw line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it! And it is affordable!!!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed much of a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many serums and  this one is very runny.  Almost like water.  I would not recommend this to anyone that is looking for a good quality Vitamin C serum.</li>
    <li> This is kind of drying.  I mix it with some face cream so my face doesn&#x27;t feel so dry.  Hopefully it is doing what it&#x27;s supposed to - don&#x27;t really know.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Since I have been using this product my acne scarring(dark pigmentation, which is minor) has been fading. I am very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate skin and gives a beautiful glow to my face.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the results of this serum!!  My skin is looking more radiant already!&lt;br /&gt;I love it!!!  Thank You.</li>
    <li> I use this serum combined with a derma roller and it does help get rid of my post acne red marks as well as making my skin soft. I love this product and will definitely buy more!</li>
    <li> I think it has really been helping my skin and reducing lines on my face.</li>
    <li> I am a former sales rep for a major skin care company and know quite a bit about the ingredients in products - what works and what doesn&#x27;t.  The bottom line - this stuff works.  I would put it on the same level as other brand name and way more expensive vitamin C products. My only comment that is not positive - the serum is slightly tacky when applied.  I have found that if I let it dry for 5-10 minutes and apply a light coat of a moisturizer - the tackiness is no longer an issue.  It&#x27;s a great product at a great price.  I would have no hesitation ordering this one again and/or recommending it to others.</li>
    <li> Thank you good product!!</li>
    <li> I bought this serum for my mother who had brown spots on her face from sun damage she says she has seen a remarkable improvement in her skin it is removing the  brown spots which makes her skin brighter the  wrinkles are smother her skin is  firmer she says she loves it</li>
    <li> I have previously used diy as well expensive ones. For the diy, I used to add commercial grade vitamin C powder from Sigma Plot to make 20% and it had amazing effect on my skin but this product did not have this same tingling effect. It has manufacturing dare of 12/09/14 and was not clear at all i.e. yellow. So it was basically an expired product with no effect! But I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to help with post-acne hyperpigmentation.  I am 30 years old with medium, acne-prone, oily and sensitive skin with facial eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is very watery, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it is not effective.  It smells great and is very lightweight. I have used it at night and the next morning, I do notice that my complexion is brighter.  However, I can&#x27;t say that it does anything for hyperpigmentation.  I am now using it during the day only because I do have differin gel (retinol) and so it makes no sense to use both.  I like it during the day because it is so light and is good for under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is all natural and affordable.  It does come with a dropper which is convenient.  I&#x27;m not sure that I would purchase again however because I do use a variety of products geared toward brightening and treating hyperpigmentation (retinol, hydroquinone, desonide lotion) and so it is difficult to tell how effective the serum is on its own.  Still, I think it is worth a try and would recommend it for that purpose.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this serum.  My skin feels so very soft and you can&#x27;t beat the quality  especially in conjunction with the price compared to other serums.</li>
    <li> I am a husband that has been married for 15 years. I bought this stuff for old wifey because whe wanted to try a new lotion with moisturizer and antioxidants for her skin instead the old one she wad using. I bought this vitamin c serum for her as a surprise and she just loves it! She puts it on every day and it has made her skin look amazing. I swear she looks ten years younger. She says that it just sinks right in and works like a charm to keep her skin all youthful and nice looking. She never said it was greasy lie she did for the other one though. I took a look at it and it even smells awesome. I thought she had put a bowl of fresh oranges out, but no it was this serum. It only took a week to make her skin look ad feel amazing. I heartily recommend this to anyone who wants to look good and have better skin than ever before!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Vitamin C Renewing Serum for less than a week, and I can already see a huge improvement in my skin. Not only is the texture smoother, it just looks brighter and more even in color. I am a licensed esthetician, so I am very picky about what I put on my face. I would not hesitate to use this product on a regular basis, and I will definitely use it on my clients. I am more than pleased with it&#x27;s function and performance. This works just as good as the Arbonne Vitamin C serum, but costs much less. I highly recommend it. This stuff is incredible! Thumbs Up!!</li>
    <li> It hasn&#x27;t even been a week and I can tell that this is helping my skin! Just to give some background to hopefully help anyone else in the same boat, I am 26, red hair/fair skinned with oily, acne prone skin that tends to have reddish uneven tones. I have been dealing with my acne, which is hormonal, for years. I was on accutane a few years back for 7 months and during that time my skin was perfect but it is such a harsh drug on your body not to mention it&#x27;s link to birth defects and about 5 months after stopping it, the same skin problems came back. My dermatologist at the time then put me on a birth control and spironolactone which has an anti-androgen effect to it and again it worked wonders, however after a few years of being on that routine, I had to come to the reality that this isn&#x27;t something I can do forever. Eventually I want to get married and have children and between the birth control and the spiro, which is known to cause birth defects in male children if it is still in your system, I decided (now almost a year and a half ago) that I would put aside all the prescription drugs and do my best to go about treating my skin problems naturally.  In short, I started from the inside by improving my eating habits, including trying to drink the recommended amount of water per day which is half your body weight in oz (ex: 145lbs &#x3D; 70.25 oz per day). Then after much trial and error and trying different supplements, I started taking an herb that is a natural androgen blocker (beta-sitosterol). Because this blocks androgens, I did notice a reduction in my oil production and even more improvement when I started only drinking coffee every now and then instead of every day since the high amounts of caffeine tend to affect hormonal balances in some cases. After these adjustments were made my skin was better than back before I started the accutane which I am grateful, but it still wasn&#x27;t completely to the point that I wanted it to be.  Then I was recently reading an article on skin care and how even with hormonal acne being a more internal issue, that in some cases it needs to be taken care of both internally and externally. I came across a list of some of the top nutrients that our skin needs including A, E, B3......just to name a few...and of course vitamin C. Having dealing with oily sensitive skin for so long, I was always hesitant about putting anything on my face (especially since I had tried creams in the past before accutane and none of them seemed to work) but I decided to try this product and I am very happy with it! The smell is very subtle, pleasant and hardly noticeable, and the serum absorbs so well into my skin and feels great afterwards! My skin looks noticeably better and more even toned! If I am getting these kind of results after less than a week of taking it, I am very eager to see how it will do long term to help even with acne scars. Yesterday I even went to run a quick errand and didn&#x27;t feel the need to put foundation on my face!! I am also using a B3 facial serum in conjunction with this. Thank you for reading. This was kind of long winded but just wanted to share in hopes of helping anyone else. Love this product and will continue to take!</li>
    <li> I have noticed such a difference in my skin since I started using Vitamin C serum last fall.  The only problem?  It can be very spendy.  This serum is a great price, and has the same amount of C as more expensive products.</li>
    <li> After paying so much for expensive face serums for so many years, I had little expectations for this unbelieably reasonably priced serum. I decided to give it a try only because I was mad as hell for being treated like an ATM by the skincare companies and I wasn&#x27;t going to take it anymore! I&#x27;m ecstatic that I did! This unassuming elixir of youth feels and works exactly like the high end ones I was accustomed to but without the hefty price tag. The best part is that IT COMES IN A GENERIC WHITE BOX! Yes my fellow citizens of the nation of Vanity, a white box with no fancy graphics printed on it! With face dewy and radiant, I&#x27;m laughing defiantly in the face of global warming, &amp;#34;You may give me heat, you may give me drought, and you may put less food in my stomach but you will never put wrinkles on my face!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Very happy with the texture and quality and price of this serum. Am purchasing two more for backup. I am only removing one star because the dropper doesnt keep vitamin c as fresh, it would be great in a pump or even spray packaging although i understand this could add to the expense. I will be decanting my backups into a larger pump bottle so problem solved. I have already recommended this product to several friends who are all waiting on their orders :)</li>
    <li> Worked well and skin looked brighter and tighter, however I broke out pretty badly after a week of use...</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. I have very sensitive skin and cystic acne. This helped with both and made my skin glow. I put it on in the morning and at night, after I had washed my face. Didn&#x27;t leave sticky or oily feeling, and the smell of it wasn&#x27;t bad nor did it leaves face smelling like it.</li>
    <li> The serum was extremely cloudy and clumpy. Im a bit disappointed.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the results of this serum!! I would have no hesitation ordering this one again and/or recommending it to others.</li>
    <li> works as well as products many times the price.</li>
    <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure this would make a difference, but it does. My skin is smoother and my pores look smaller! For the first time in years, I can just wear a finishing powder and look fine. It&#x27;s not a miracle - I mean I don&#x27;t look YEARS younger, but it does help for sure to make your skin look better!!</li>
    <li> The mixture is cloudier than it looks in the picture but it is an alright smelling product that absorbs rapidly into skin. My skin definitely feels better but if you don&#x27;t like herbal scents I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this. I personally don&#x27;t mind it, so long as the product is working. 1 month update: This product is decreasing some of my acne scars. My complexion is becoming more even as well. I would highly recommend for those with pigmentation problems.</li>
    <li> I have used this daily along with a Dermaroller. I don&#x27;t notice a difference in my skin, but that&#x27;s not even the reason I am giving it a low rating. It doesn&#x27;t smell good. It has a musty floral scent that is off-putting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying few difference Vitamin C Serums and this is one of it.  Nothing different or notice any change to my complexion.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing. Love using it on my neck since I don&#x27;t like actual lotion moisturizers on my neck. This serum works great. Kinda smells bad but doesn&#x27;t last long. Only when you first apply it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to really review it. It absorbs quickly into the skin. I use it with the Hyaluronic Acid serum, a tip I got from a show I watched. It&#x27;s supposed to be an anti aging formula.</li>
    <li> Use it ever night and wake up to smooth skin</li>
    <li> Good price, but it took  me more than half the bottle to notice a clearer skin.</li>
    <li> Not too greasy or oily. My wife has been using it for weeks now and she takes it everywhere she goes. The stuff works. It brings out her complexion in a flattering way, because its light, and has a nice subtle scent. The serum also has some vitamin 5 in it, which I think helped clear away a scar she&#x27;d gotten years ago. I would recommend this to anyone who have tried many face creams and have been disappointed. This Amari really works!</li>
    <li> love it....see a difference</li>
    <li> Product feels great on skin and noticeably smooths my face and hands. I am excited to see long term results!</li>
    <li> easy to use and blend with other beverage.</li>
    <li> I just got this in the mail today, so I have only tried it one time. I am giving it 3 stars because what I received was not what was shown, and I do not like that, I am making my choice to buy on what is shown and the reviews...  A lot of reviews stated that they would prefer a dropper, but it said (and shows) a spray bottle.  I do not notice any smell at all, like some others stated.  It seems to take a lot of the serum to cover your face as well.  I will post another review after I have used the whole bottle.</li>
    <li> I love it&lt;br /&gt;Good!!!</li>
    <li> I like this product. I have sensitive skin and really liked how this product did not irritate my face. I felt a cool sensation to my to face and after a while my skin felt more firm. I am hoping it will continue to impress me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about a week now and I&#x27;ve already had some compliments on my skin, from my Esti teacher and other students. They&#x27;re asking me to bring this in so they can see it.</li>
    <li> This stuff if pretty good. I put it on after I wash my face and then I use moisturizer with it. I then put my makeup on after. In just a few days the texture of my skin has improved DRAMATICALLY!! I have used many other vitamin C serums and this formula leaves my skin hydrated and smoothed whereas others left it feeling dry and tight. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is overall much smoother and glows from the extra hydration.  I think it had helped my complexion immensely! I received this product in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;You just need a tiny bit of the product so this one bottle will last a really long time, it&#x27;s an unbelievable deal for such a high quality product</li>
    <li> mrs here, love using organic, can see a difference.</li>
    <li> The spray seems to waste product.  I prefer a pour top.</li>
    <li> I have been researching anti aging products, and almost everyone recommends Vitamin C, E and Ferulic Acid to help older skin produce new collagen, help to reduce fine lines and wrinkles, and plump up the skin on the face and neck.  So, I came to Amazon to buy a Vitamin C, E and Ferulic Acid Serum.  Wow!  There are a lot of these serums out there and some of them are SO expensive!  The Amari brand serum is a great price for $19.99 and has the exact same ingredients as some of the much more expensive serums!  This is not the same texture as you would expect a serum to be.  It has a pump and it has a much more liquid consistency than that of a typical serum.  I put  two pumps of the serum on my palms and pat it onto my face and neck.  It feels very soothing and is so gentle that I can even use it around my eyes!  I can NEVER find anything that does not burn my under eye skin, but this serum does not burn at all!  My boyfriend keeps telling me that my eyes have less wrinkles and my skin looks better in general.  I have only been using the product for a couple of weeks, and I really LOVE this Serum!  I have bought several other serums in the recent past and they are more expensive, thicker, and do not last nearly as long with the dropper as opposed to the pump on this bottle.  I will continue to use the Amari brand Vitamin C, E and Ferulic Acid Serum as it seems to be working very well in just a couple of short weeks!</li>
    <li> It is really good vitamin c sediment</li>
    <li> I want to give this five stars, but i&#x27;ve only begun using the serum so i cant be too sure as to how effective this really is, but so far after only two uses I really like this serum. Some background information on me, i have light to medium complected skin, oily skin with acne scarring and cystic acne around my jaw line and neck. I originally bought this serum to use along with a derma roller but i received this serum a lot sooner than my derma roller and decided to start using right away anyway. First, I received my package in a timely manner, and i really liked how the seller personally emailed me checking in to see if I had received my package on time and to ask how i like the serum. Second, a lot of people who left reviews stated they received a bottle with a spray nozzle, but i actually received the bottle with a dropper as the picture indicates, and it does have some kind of an earthy scent, but it doesnt bother me so much. Lastly, as i stated earlier i&#x27;ve only used this serum twice, but its done wonders in reducing the active cystic acne that i have already, and i&#x27;ve noticed a difference in skin tone and lightness as well. I definitely will continue using this product, its not a bad deal for the price. I will say though i do have sensitive skin and although its done a great job somehow in reducing my cystic acne, i do have a few small pimples that i suspect were caused from the initial use of the serum, but thats why i will only continue to use this product sparingly throughout the week, instead of twice everyday. But i&#x27;ve read a lot of information that states small breakouts are common for people with sensitive skin when using vitamic c serums. Overall its a great product, just be careful to not overuse if you have very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I like it. It goes on smooth and does not have that citric acid burn. It also does not have that sour taste, which those of us who have used Vit. C serum know about. No. I do not taste my serums, but you cannot help but get some on your lips and incidentally it happens. So far so good...</li>
    <li> I saw this recommended by a commenter on a beauty website.  I have only been using this for a week or so but I like it so far.  I thought it improved a relatively new scar and my skin&#x27;s texture a bit, especially for this price.</li>
    <li> I have used it long enough to tell a difference in my skin yet but I do really like it. I like the way it feels on my skin. It doesn&#x27;t smell the best.</li>
    <li> My skin is beginning to feel and look smoother.  I enjoy the way my skin feels right after I rub Amari Organic Vitamin C Renewing Serum on each morning and night.</li>
    <li> I currently work as a Real Estate agent in beautiful sunny California, so I am outdoors for most of my days as I show home buyers new properties to own. Being out is such a great way to spend my working days, but I get very concerned with the potential damage the sun may have on my skin. At the risk of sounding vain, physical appearance for a Real Estate agent, especially in the state of California, is very important with the presentation for potential home buyers. They look for people they can trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was asked to test the Amari Renewing Serum I became really excited. It sounded like this product would help protect my skin especially since it contains Vitamins E and B3 in addition to high concentration of vitamin C. I immediately fell in love with it! My skin looks brighter and more youthful. Similar products may cause breakouts, but I have not experienced this after a weeks of use. In fact, it even helped clear my skin even more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended this product to family, friends and co-workers in the same profession, and they are all very happy I did. The product is lightweight so I can carry it with me anywhere I go. Other products can feel greasy, but not the Amari Renewing Serum! I use it twice a day (recommended) and it really rejuvenates and moisturize my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gave me the results I have been looking for, and in a compact solution. If you&#x27;re on the fence, or have tried many products with less than stellar results, give this serum a try. I am so glad I did and have not looked back since!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;everyone who got this is very satisfied about this serum.</li>
    <li> This serum is the most powerful advanced formula with a super concentration of vitamin c, e and ferulic and hyaluronic  acids when combined together gives your skin a boost of nutrients that penetrates deep into your skin to give you a youthful, vibrant, overly nourished skin that you can actually see and feel.    With Amari you can expect to have your skin to be more hydrated and moisturized, that means no more dull skin. This tremendous formula stimulates collagen production for a more plumpier face and wrinkles and fine lines reduction giving your face a more younger and healthier skin and face. Try it today!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have ordered things for my mother through my account before, and every once in awhile, she wants me to write a review, because she is so impressed with the product. She has been looking for a facial cream that would make her skin look more youthful, and take away some of the blemishes. She saw this one, and saw that it also helped to reverse sun damage that has already happened, as well as protect her skin in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has been using it for a few weeks now, and has already seen results. She says the moisturizers and antioxidants are doing wonders for her complexion. During the winter, she normally has dry skin problems, especially when it gets as cold as it has been this winter, but since using this, she has had no problems. She has already told me to order another bottle, so I guess she recommends it!</li>
    <li> This product contains phenoxethanol, a chemical that even the often-clueless FDA is worried about. How can this possibly be considered a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Google phenoxethanol, do your own research.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Vitamin C Renewing Serum for less than a week, and I can already see a huge improvement in my skin. Not only is the texture smoother, it just looks brighter and more even in color.&lt;br /&gt; I am more than pleased with it&#x27;s function and performance.&lt;br /&gt;  I will keep you updated as the time goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I got a same of the Skinceuticals brand of vitamin C serum. This stuff feels, smells, and works every bit as well as that brand, which is over $100 per ounce. In fact, I will always order this brand. The customer service and follow-up is great. Just keep the product and price the same, and I will always be a return customer.</li>
    <li> The smell is not citrus-y nor acidic. It smells more like an egg white. But when you apply it on your face you will feel some little sting. My wife uses it after using the derma roller. Hopefully it will indeed help in lightening her pimple scars.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum. My 40 year old skin looks pretty darn good. I have a youthful pink glow and I never have to wear foundation. I find that my under eye area doesn&#x27;t look quite as &#x27;tired&#x27; as it did in the past. Just be sure to use this stuff with a good moisturizer (with SPF) because it can be a bit drying. Also, don&#x27;t use it on the same day you&#x27;ve exfoliated. It will BURN! Otherwise, prepare yourself for some mild tingling that goes away a few minutes after application. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This product has softened the skin on my face significantly. I picked this up to perk up my skin routine as part of my new years resolution. I have been using over a month and I can feel a difference. My mom teases me and says my face feels like my bottom used to feel. I am picking up a bottle for her. I use this twice a day, mixed in my hand with niacinamide and a face cream-spf for day, and olay for night! (Mixing it helps to solve the only issue I have with this product, it is very thin and watery). I hope this product stays around for a while, it really works!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, packaging was fine and seems relatively new (not an outdated or expired product!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like it is making a difference but hard to tell. I&#x27;ll update again later.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference honestly. Kind of burns a little.</li>
    <li> I love the serum!  It gave me a glow the first and every time I used it especially after a scrub or using a derma roller!  I did notice a huge difference with crepiness and pores.</li>
    <li> I  love  this.&lt;br /&gt;It  works  greatly.&lt;br /&gt;I  feel  my  face  is  upgreded.</li>
    <li> I was really cheap to buy your stuff. The quality of goods is also very good. Thank you.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I&#x27;ve only been using for a couple weeks, I can&#x27;t see my sun spots fading really, but I do like the product.  It goes on well, absorbs and leaves skin feeling moisturized but not greasy.  It doesn&#x27;t make me breakout.  Hopefully, I&#x27;ll see some results in the next month as far as more even skin tone.</li>
    <li> I Love what it does for my skin! Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I gave it 3 stars only because package was delayed. However I have used the serum twice and I like the texture of the serum. I am currently waiting on my derma roller to get the full effect of the serum.</li>
    <li> a good gentle vitamin c serum</li>
    <li> I carry this product in my diaper bag because i like to refresh myself on hot humid days. The vitamin C has really helped protect my face from excess  sun damage. I live in Florida, so this is a really big plus for me. I love that it uses natural ingredients and isnt&#x27; water based like others i have tried.&lt;br /&gt;You may want to hold the bottle about a foot away from your face before spraying, as it comes off very strong and it will surprise you. The product smells great. i opened the bottle as soon as i got it, and it smells like oranges. The liquid may look greasy, but as it comes out of the spray bottle, it is not oily. It is perfect enough to moisturize your face without leaving it oily.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed my skin is less dry than it normally is, so i love using this product. I spray it on my face about 2 times a day, usually when i am outside and need a nice mist.&lt;br /&gt;Please not that you may dab it on your face instead of spraying. I may start doing this as i sometimes notice my lips going numb at times after spraying the product. i received this product in return for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using  this about ten days and I haven&#x27;t seen improvements in any areas such as tone, elasticty, volume, tightnes, fullness, firmness, anything.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. My skin has always been pretty good, but as I get older, I&#x27;ve been getting acne on my cheeks. I bought this product to increase my collagen production and for skin lightening to even out my skin tone. I&#x27;ve been using this about a month now and my skin is even softer than it was before. My skin is brighter, but it probably takes awhile to see my skin even out. But overall, I like this product and I will be buying more of it. The cost was great compared to a lot of the other Vitamin C serum products out there. And I didn&#x27;t want to purchase a very expensive product and have my skin break my out because I do have sensitive skin and  I tend to break out with new products.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful, leaves my face looking radiant.  Really helps improve coloration, and pigmentation issues. Without any greasy residue left.  Nor sticky feeling. Product received for review.</li>
    <li> Good to use. My wife like it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> Absolutely it&#x27;s  awesome.&lt;br /&gt;My friends also very liked it.</li>
    <li> My product came not only on time, but early as well. I have been using it for 2 days now and I am completely blown away by the rapid results. The serum comes in a small eye dropper glass. The serum goes on smooth and isn&#x27;t oily at all. I am Carmel skin complexity and have dark under eyes as well as smiliing lines under my eyes. In just two application s I see improved color in my dark eye circles. I also see my lines disappearing. You can visibly see how your skin plumps up after application! I am so happy with my results. This is a must buy</li>
