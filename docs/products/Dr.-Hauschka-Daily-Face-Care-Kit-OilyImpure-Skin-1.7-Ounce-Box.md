      <li>The toner is amazing and probably the best product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE</li>
      <li>All are great.</li>
      <li>It worked great for my face.</li>
      <li>Great way to try this product.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure they are great as well!</li>
      <li>so glad that I tried this product!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>I love the Dr. Hauschka products!  </li>
      <li>In the morning I just rinse with warm water and then apply the moisturizer.</li>
      <li>gave it 4 stars because of the effect of the normalizing oil, the nice box packaging, and the smell.</li>
      <li>I love most organic products, but still couldn&#x27;t find something that worked.</li>
      <li>Just love it.  </li>
      <li>Most of the products in the kit broke me out except the balancing oil.</li>
      <li>most* of the ingredients.</li>
      <li>interesting.</li>
      <li>The shine control oil, the steam liquid and the refreshing mask are all products I&#x27;d use again.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this product.  </li>
      <li>I love *</li>
      <li>Dr. Hauschka is an excellent product that I have used personally for many years.</li>
      <li>They smell very organic and earthy which is very nice.</li>
      <li>This box was pretty good and lasted me about a month, which is because I used everything mostly sparingly (</li>
      <li>I also ordered a full size of the Rose Day Cream with this and love it, though I use it as an overnight cream.</li>
      <li>First, the good:</li>
      <li>I have dry skin, but love the clarifying oil because it soaks into my skin and smells absolutely incredible.  </li>
      <li>(&lt;br /&gt;But, for the day I used it, it was relatively easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>After struggling with acne for years and spending hundreds of dollars, I am so happy to finally say it&#x27;s over.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I read first before put it the products on.</li>
      <li>I use the face wash, toner, clarifying oil, and the revitalizing face mask if I feel the need for something special.  </li>
      <li>really appreciate that its not tested on animals :)</li>
      <li>I have a closet full of reject products that I tried and didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>Smells mild which I like.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used the steam liquid and refreshing mask once, but was pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The not-so-good:&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is just...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably skip this in the future and stick with alcohol free witch hazel and a bit of rose</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got ground-up something-or-other (almonds, I think) and it does provide a mild exfoliation, but if I use a toner after this, there&#x27;s still lots of makeup on my face.</li>
      <li>My face has never been better: it looks clean, clear, moisturized but not oily...</li>
      <li>Steaming kit and rejuvenating mask probably are great for long term usage-I didn&#x27;t care for them much.</li>
      <li>This is great way to try few products and metal case can be use for storage or when traveling.</li>
      <li>It takes a week or two if not longer, but it&#x27;s worth it.   </li>
      <li>I like the nice essential oil smell to it.</li>
      <li>It takes about 1-2 minutes total and the results are spectacular.</li>
      <li>It is absolutely worth every penny</li>
      <li>I hope it works better for other people. :)</li>
      <li>I was looking forward to use these skin care products, but after reading the ingredients had to return it right away.</li>
      <li>I definitely noticed that my pores are diminished (because they are mostly cleaned out) and also that my face doesn&#x27;t get oily during the day</li>
      <li>Dr. Hauschka ingredients may be deemed irritating by some, but my skin loves them and I feel good about using them!</li>
      <li>Makes my overly dry skin feel very comfortable.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to try a full facial regime, but I didn&#x27;t want to dole out the cashola on the full sized products until I knew that this would really give me results that I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the healed places would leave large holes).  </li>
      <li>My skin feels fresh, soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought my kit at Whole Foods</li>
      <li>Whole Foods, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try when I saw it on amazon.</li>
      <li>I have used the whole tin, which lasted about a week, and I am already going out without makeup on.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very allergic to all these ingredients.</li>
      <li>And I use a Clarasonic for exfoliation, so this doesn&#x27;t really serve any purpose for me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its very informative</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I really recommend everything that comes in the box, although I have not tried the steam bath yet.</li>
      <li>But when I saw how reasonable the sampler was, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
      <li>I have severe chemical allergies and had to switch back to more natural products.</li>
      <li>The only thing that would not last as long as the others is the clarifying toner, which is why I assume that the full sized bottle contains more product than full sized tubes of the others...</li>
      <li>but I would get more in other places(and</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t be a full review because a day after I started using the products I went to a dermatologist who prescribed topical antibiotics for me</li>
      <li>/&gt;The day oil and toner are decent products - just buy them alone and not in this kit.</li>
      <li>I have acne-prone and super oily Asian skin.</li>
      <li>The normalizing oil was interesting, the night I put it on when I woke up my face was much less oily than it normally is when I wake up.</li>
      <li>They are still there, but I am hoping with a few more sessions with the clay mask, they will soon be history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was previously using SK-II, and I like this MUCH better.</li>
      <li>Once I stopped using regular brands and started to use natural products (and less products) my skin changed for better tremendously.</li>
      <li>Will buy the normal size.</li>
      <li>Dr Hauschka products are really organic, I am so done with \\&quot;green\\&quot; products which state that are non comedogenic, won&#x27;t clog pores, but are full of pore clogging ingredients (google research; \\&quot;non comedogenic\\&quot;, \\&quot;non acnegenic\\&quot; and other statements are not regulated so producers can use them even though their product is not what they say).  </li>
      <li>I am 33 and decided to try something new.</li>
      <li>Seriously, this product is amazing.</li>
      <li>I have to say that I tried this the first day it arrived and instantly noticed improvement in my skin!</li>
      <li>Honestly I probably never will - I&#x27;m not interested in spending that much time washing my face.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure about those who claim there are no instructions...</li>
      <li>expectations of this product were that it would help to balance out my skin&#x27;s natural oil production (because I&#x27;d be essentially fighting oil with oil) and that it would help reduce my comedones and the appearance of my large pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Someone at Amazon should have the job of listing the most common allergens in the products.</li>
      <li>I have much healthier skin in a very short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So I decided to go natural and a coworker recommended it.  </li>
      <li>My set had complete instructions on how to use each product.</li>
      <li>should add that I also bought a Nutrisonic cleansing brush and started at the same time, which I would also highly recommend.</li>
      <li>After I put the oil on my face, I always cup my hands over my face and take several deep breaths ... pure aromatherapy.  </li>
      <li>They are nowhere near as big or noticeable.</li>
      <li>Nice products but, expensive.</li>
      <li>The other products didn&#x27;t interest me much &amp; I haven&#x27;t tried them yet.</li>
      <li>The particular mini bottle that comes with the kit is not very comfortable to use as getting the oil from the bottle to your hand is tricky (no dropper, the bottle mouth is big enough for the oil to poor out), so I kind of put my finger on the mouth like a stopper, tilt the bottle, and apply the oil gradually to my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Long enough to give you some idea of whether or not you want to invest the considerable amount in the full-size products.</li>

<li> but like I said, a little bit DEFINITELY goes a long way.)</li>
<li> I had seen these products at my local coop, but was hesitant to buy something that was a little spendy.</li>

    <li> Great if you want to try out the range before spending $50 per piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have clogged pores, and after a few weeks I can definitely see some improvement. They are nowhere near as big or noticeable. They are still there, but I am hoping with a few more sessions with the clay mask, they will soon be history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was previously using SK-II, and I like this MUCH better. I have much healthier skin in a very short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only one thing I would say - go to the website and follow the instructions from there for the facial steam and clay mask. I completely stuffed it up because I got confused with the directions that came with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also really appreciate that its not tested on animals :)</li>
    <li> This should be called a trial kit.&lt;br /&gt;Here are the sizes, since they didn&#x27;t list when I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Cleanser cream 0.34 oz&lt;br /&gt;Masque 0.17 oz&lt;br /&gt;Facial steam bath 0.34 oz&lt;br /&gt;Toner 0.34 oz&lt;br /&gt;Clay mask 0.34 oz&lt;br /&gt;Day oil 0.17 oz&lt;br /&gt;Terrible cleanser - I tried it and my face was not clean afterwards at all.&lt;br /&gt;It does come with a little booklet explaining which product does what.&lt;br /&gt;The day oil and toner are decent products - just buy them alone and not in this kit. They smell very organic and earthy which is very nice.</li>
    <li> I have been an acne victim for years. I am 33 and decided to try something new. I love most organic products, but still couldn&#x27;t find something that worked. After doing online research, I found Dr Hauschka.  I had seen these products at my local coop, but was hesitant to buy something that was a little spendy. I have a closet full of reject products that I tried and didn&#x27;t work. I was sick of putting all of my money down the drain.  However, Dr Hauschka had a trial kit, so I gave it a go. I was shocked by the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should add that I also bought a Nutrisonic cleansing brush and started at the same time, which I would also highly recommend. In just 4 days, I noticed a 90% reduction in my acne! Seriously, this product is amazing. Daily, I basically use the creamy cleanser, toner, and oil.  It takes about 1-2 minutes total and the results are spectacular. My skin feels fresh, soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> Great way to try this product. It worked great for my face. I use it regularly and am a ongoing customer because of the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> I love the Dr. Hauschka products!  I have been using these products for several years.  These products eliminated the skin problems I had an the beginning of menopause.  I am frequently complimented on how few facial wrinkles I have vs. other women my age.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit with the intentions of giving Dr. Haushka a try. I really wanted to try a full facial regime, but I didn&#x27;t want to dole out the cashola on the full sized products until I knew that this would really give me results that I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My expectations of this product were that it would help to balance out my skin&#x27;s natural oil production (because I&#x27;d be essentially fighting oil with oil) and that it would help reduce my comedones and the appearance of my large pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad that I tried this product! I really recommend everything that comes in the box, although I have not tried the steam bath yet. I also recommend the Quince Moisturizer at night instead of the oil. I definitely noticed that my pores are diminished (because they are mostly cleaned out) and also that my face doesn&#x27;t get oily during the day (the oil you put on doesn&#x27;t make it oily, and a little bit goes a long way!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, needless to say, by now I have purchased most of the full-size products which are in this box. This box was pretty good and lasted me about a month, which is because I used everything mostly sparingly (but like I said, a little bit DEFINITELY goes a long way.) The only thing that would not last as long as the others is the clarifying toner, which is why I assume that the full sized bottle contains more product than full sized tubes of the others... Good product if you&#x27;re wanting to try something holistic!</li>
    <li> I bought my kit at Whole Foods and I like it. Dr Hauschka products are really organic, I am so done with \\&quot;green\\&quot; products which state that are non comedogenic, won&#x27;t clog pores, but are full of pore clogging ingredients (google research; \\&quot;non comedogenic\\&quot;, \\&quot;non acnegenic\\&quot; and other statements are not regulated so producers can use them even though their product is not what they say).  Once I stopped using regular brands and started to use natural products (and less products) my skin changed for better tremendously. This kit helped a lot. It takes a week or two if not longer, but it&#x27;s worth it.   The best from this kit for me are: cleanser, tonic and oil. Steaming kit and rejuvenating mask probably are great for long term usage-I didn&#x27;t care for them much. This is great way to try few products and metal case can be use for storage or when traveling.</li>
    <li> It won&#x27;t be a full review because a day after I started using the products I went to a dermatologist who prescribed topical antibiotics for me and I am on a completely different regimen now :(&lt;br /&gt;But, for the day I used it, it was relatively easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;My cleansing cream was curd like (I am not sure if it is meant to be of that consistency, maybe other users can confirm?). The toner was not too harsh (no burning and drying after wiping my face with it). The normalizing oil was interesting, the night I put it on when I woke up my face was much less oily than it normally is when I wake up. The particular mini bottle that comes with the kit is not very comfortable to use as getting the oil from the bottle to your hand is tricky (no dropper, the bottle mouth is big enough for the oil to poor out), so I kind of put my finger on the mouth like a stopper, tilt the bottle, and apply the oil gradually to my face.&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried the mask or the steam bath.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because of the effect of the normalizing oil, the nice box packaging, and the smell. I did not want to bring the product down just because I did not try it for long enough.</li>
    <li> First, the good: The shine control oil, the steam liquid and the refreshing mask are all products I&#x27;d use again. The shine control oil just requires a drop or two in you hand and then rub your hands together and pat them over your face. Works. I&#x27;ve only used the steam liquid and refreshing mask once, but was pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The not-so-good:&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is just...interesting. It&#x27;s got ground-up something-or-other (almonds, I think) and it does provide a mild exfoliation, but if I use a toner after this, there&#x27;s still lots of makeup on my face. And I use a Clarasonic for exfoliation, so this doesn&#x27;t really serve any purpose for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toner: I love *most* of the ingredients. I like the nice essential oil smell to it. I do not like putting anything with alcohol on my skin. I&#x27;ll probably skip this in the future and stick with alcohol free witch hazel and a bit of rose water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The samples look small, but you use so little (except maybe the cleanser) that they last a long time. Long enough to give you some idea of whether or not you want to invest the considerable amount in the full-size products. I also ordered a full size of the Rose Day Cream with this and love it, though I use it as an overnight cream.</li>
    <li> Most of the products in the kit broke me out except the balancing oil. I have acne-prone and super oily Asian skin. This brand is not for me. I hope it works better for other people. :)</li>
    <li> After struggling with acne for years and spending hundreds of dollars, I am so happy to finally say it&#x27;s over. I found the product that healed my acne, stopped my breakouts, and restored the balance and vitality to my skin. I almost didn&#x27;t even try Dr. Hauschka, because of the cost. But when I saw how reasonable the sampler was, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I have used the whole tin, which lasted about a week, and I am already going out without makeup on. For me, this has almost been a miracle. I know that everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but I would recommend that anyone who struggles with acne to give this sampler a try! Seriously, the only downside is that now I am going to be spending a lot of $ on these products for the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> Purchased as part of a gift to my niece. Dr. Hauschka is an excellent product that I have used personally for many years. Makes my overly dry skin feel very comfortable. I however was disappointed that the little tin that it came in was rather badly dented. Decided that it was not suitable to give as a gift.</li>
    <li> I am SO incredibly happy my friend recommended this! I had a very complicated, acne prone skin. Guess what...My face has never been better: it looks clean, clear, moisturized but not oily... It is absolutely worth every penny and I am eternally grateful to my friend!</li>
    <li> I have struggled with skin problems for about 15 years, trying a variety of products over the years. I have to say that I tried this the first day it arrived and instantly noticed improvement in my skin! I use the wash creme at night, followed by the toner and moisturizer. All are great. In the morning I just rinse with warm water and then apply the moisturizer. If I skip a day or two of using the products my skin will break out, so I know it&#x27;s working! I have not tried the other products that come in this kit but I&#x27;m sure they are great as well! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> These products felt nice on my acne prone skin, it didn&#x27;t react badly on me whatsoever. I think my skin texture improved a little. Smells mild which I like. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product.  I have been getting some weird acne on my face.  Tried everything from harsh acne meds and soap(some with high doses of glycolic acid) and some prescription acne creams and nothing was making them stop.  The acne would go away but I would get more in other places(and the healed places would leave large holes).  So I decided to go natural and a coworker recommended it.  Been using it for a few short weeks and my acne is gone and my acne has not been resurfacing and the large holes left behind by the other stuff.  Just love it.  The toner is amazing and probably the best product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE ON HOW TO USE THESE PRODUCTS:&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend going on the products website to learn about the products and the doctors recommendations on how to use the products and how the doctor views skincare.  Its very informative</li>
    <li> Nice products but, expensive. Will buy the normal size.</li>
    <li> I have severe chemical allergies and had to switch back to more natural products. I remembered seeing this line at my local (45 minute away) Whole Foods, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try when I saw it on amazon. I absolutely love it! The cleansing cream &amp; balancing oil are awesome. The other products didn&#x27;t interest me much &amp; I haven&#x27;t tried them yet. Honestly I probably never will - I&#x27;m not interested in spending that much time washing my face.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure about those who claim there are no instructions... My set had complete instructions on how to use each product.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin, but love the clarifying oil because it soaks into my skin and smells absolutely incredible.  After I put the oil on my face, I always cup my hands over my face and take several deep breaths ... pure aromatherapy.  I started using these products when I lived in Germany from 2003-2006; I could purchase them at the local grocery store or pharmacy (very convenient and less expensive).  I use the face wash, toner, clarifying oil, and the revitalizing face mask if I feel the need for something special.  Over the years, I tried different products because I was appalled at the price of Dr. Hauscka in the U.S.; however, I keep returning to these products.  I make home products with essential oils for face, body, and hair, but prefer these products for everyday facial care ... my only addition is a Pratima neem oil/zinc oxide sunscreen.  I&#x27;m 44 years old and retired from the military in 2011; I have people tell me regularly the &amp;#34;math&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t add up ... they don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any way I can be retired at such a &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; age ... of course they don&#x27;t know I&#x27;m 44!  I credit these comments to a simple, healthy skin care routine ... if you do a search online for &amp;#34;best skin care products,&amp;#34; several sites rate Dr. Hauscka products poorly because the ingredients may be &amp;#34;irritating.&amp;#34;  This is typically coming from product lines using mineral oils and parabens ... Dr. Hauschka ingredients may be deemed irritating by some, but my skin loves them and I feel good about using them!</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to use these skin care products, but after reading the ingredients had to return it right away. I&#x27;m glad I read first before put it the products on. The Cleansing Cream, Normalizing Day Oil, and the Rejuvenating Mask contain Almond oil, Peanut oil, and Wheat Germ oil. I&#x27;m very allergic to all these ingredients. I can&#x27;t even touch almonds because I start itching like a dog with fleas! In my case, it should have included an EPI pen. Someone at Amazon should have the job of listing the most common allergens in the products. I didn&#x27;t try any of the other 2 products, so I can&#x27;t comments on those. I gave it 3 stars based on other reviews.</li>
