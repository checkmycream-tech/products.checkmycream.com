      <li>The smell is way too strong for my liking - the fragrance lingered 24 hours</li>
      <li>My hair has fine texture, and I have a lot of it.  </li>

      <li>really helps with frizz, it smells amazing..</li>
      <li>So far, this styling cream has been my first purchase and I am extremely happy with it.  </li>
      <li>Really worth the money!</li>
      <li>The primer keeps my hair clean longer and the styling cream (along with the curling iron) gives me defined waves that stand the test of time.  </li>
      <li>and my hair is soft and shiny with a nice amount of hold.  </li>
      <li>It did a fairly good job, though my hair did still get a bit frizzy after being outside in the humidity for a while.</li>
      <li>I would purchase full size of the nourishing cream and leave in.</li>
      <li>Really works for curly hair, love all these products</li>
      <li>The best thing about it is that you can use quite a large amount of it (if needed) and it doesn&#x27;t look greasy or make your hair feel funny after your blow dry it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty strongly scented.  </li>
      <li>I have received several nice comments about my &amp;#34;shiny hair.&amp;#34;  Although the product is pricey, you are worth it!</li>
      <li>Worth every penny for days when I need to have a &amp;#34;good hair day&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I have very straight hair already and it never occurred to me to use something like this, but ever since that revelation at the salon, I want to use this every day.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is good but a little too pricey.</li>
      <li>Then I add a tiny bit more, if needed.  </li>
      <li>Love this styling cream, controls frizz, helps prepare hair for styling with flat iron!</li>
      <li>You would never see my hair today and know it was damaged or even that it wasn&#x27;t a lovely, soft, natural wave.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s somewhat of a mystery how exactly the frizz is controlled, but it works and that&#x27;s all I really care about.  </li>
      <li>I have kinky curls under my nape and stretched curls on top</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t be without it - keeps your hair straight &amp; frizz free until your next wash.</li>
      <li>Really does protect against frizz.</li>
      <li>He thinks it worked very well.  </li>
      <li>This really tames the frizz.  </li>
      <li>I received a free sample and had to purchase a larger bottle.</li>
      <li>I wear down jackets (I&#x27;m allergic to wool) and my hair was picking up so much static</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this styling cream and all the LP products I&#x27;ve mentioned.</li>
      <li>and I used this product while vacationing in the Caribbean with high humidity.</li>
      <li>so it lasts a super long time.</li>
      <li>I also tried the curl detangling rinse which is a new product from their line.</li>
      <li>It does NOT weigh my fine hair down.  </li>
      <li>I have naturally wavy hair which get frizzy in high humidity.  </li>
      <li>I have tried a million products and this line is the first one that i have found that actually eliminates frizz!</li>
      <li>and they keep my hair clean for several extra days.  </li>
      <li>Not only was it the best thing that ever happened to my poor, abused hair, but that little 2 oz.</li>
      <li>Soft hair, not heavy, controls my curls</li>
      <li>It reduces frizz and leaves my curls soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>Stay far far away from this product and the others in the no frizz line.  </li>
      <li>In my opinion I think he may have used too much as his hair looked too flat to me.</li>
      <li>Hair products that are obviously going to be used with other hair products should not have such a strong scent - at some point, something&#x27;s going to clash.  </li>
      <li>works super well does not make your hair stiff</li>
      <li>I live where it snows and it is very dry in the winter.  </li>

    <li> Really does protect against frizz. Amazing product.</li>
    <li> I have very very fine 4b(kinky curly) hair that frizzes extremely easily. I have tried a million products and this line is the first one that i have found that actually eliminates frizz! I tried the shampoo ( it was ok), conditioner (i liked it), leave in (loved it) and the nourishing cream (loves it). I got trial sizes of all but the leave in which i got a sample size of. They got rid od the frizz and defined my curls nicely. I would purchase full size of the nourishing cream and leave in. I would like to try the weightless spray which i hear is also great. I also tried the curl detangling rinse which is a new product from their line. It has great slip but isn&#x27;t super moisturising. My next project is to try the prime style extending cream (got a sample) along with the no frizz stuff to see how that goes.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t be without it - keeps your hair straight &amp; frizz free until your next wash. AMAZING RESULTS!</li>
    <li> Actually made mine and my daughters hair look awful!</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my husband as he has wavy - curly hair.  He thinks it worked very well.  In my opinion I think he may have used too much as his hair looked too flat to me.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this and splits it with my Daughter they each get 4oz and they both love the product. Great product Living Proof Nourishing Styling Cream 8 oz Living Proof Nourishing Styling Cream 8 oz Living Proof Nourishing Styling Cream 8 oz Living Proof Nourishing Styling Cream 8 oz Living Proof Nourishing Styling Cream 8 oz</li>
    <li> I have pretty thick hair and I used this product while vacationing in the Caribbean with high humidity. It did a fairly good job, though my hair did still get a bit frizzy after being outside in the humidity for a while. I would still recommend it because it did lessen the extent of the frizziness.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair product. I was having a lot of hair frizz issues with the awful humid weather in Texas. As soon as I used this styling cream, the appearance of my hair changed drastically giving me excellent results. A small amount of the product gave my hair the softness, shine and flexibility it needed without the frizz. As soon as I blow dried my hair you could see the amazing results.  I have received several nice comments about my &amp;#34;shiny hair.&amp;#34;  Although the product is pricey, you are worth it! I will keep buying products from living proof. So far, this styling cream has been my first purchase and I am extremely happy with it.  Enjoy the product.</li>
    <li> It helps with frizz.  It&#x27;s pretty strongly scented.  Hair products that are obviously going to be used with other hair products should not have such a strong scent - at some point, something&#x27;s going to clash.  It&#x27;s not enough for my frizzy hair alone, but I mix it with Moroccan oil and a heavier cream for weight and shine.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! I use it religiously to combat bad hair days.  I have kinky curls under my nape and stretched curls on top but I can be smooth and sleek or styled without all the weight of hairspray! Also great for an overnight or 2 without having to wash my hair (perfect for camping)</li>
    <li> This is the best Leave-in-Conditioner &amp; Styling Cream I have ever used.  Light, non-greasy, and conditions your hair well while also providing a little styling hold and helps keep frizz away! Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I have thick, naturally wavy/curly hair so in the summer humidity there&#x27;s really not much I can do to tame the frizz.  This product is pricey, but it seems to be helping.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s doing anything miraculous but I&#x27;m gonna stick with it for now.</li>
    <li> Works great on my hair - I don&#x27;t use it every day since it&#x27;s expensive. Worth every penny for days when I need to have a &amp;#34;good hair day&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy hair which get frizzy in high humidity.  This really tames the frizz.  I use it on damp hair after a shower.  The next day I wet my hands and re-dampen my hair.  Then I add a tiny bit more, if needed.  I wash my hair twice a week and just need small touch-ups with this cream if the weather is foggy.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t cut it for my annoying gray hair frizz/fuzz, at least it didn&#x27;t do any better than my Unite, Davines, Rusk, AG or Loma products.  The smell is way too strong for my liking - the fragrance lingered 24 hours and I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash my hair the next day.  I even had to wash a second time before the smell went down the drain.  I seriously would have put up with the smell - if the product worked as well as others have suggested but I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s the gray hair that&#x27;s the issue.  Getting moisture into the hair without it curling up is such a challenge.  Boooooo!</li>
    <li> Really works for curly hair, love all these products</li>
    <li> Love this styling cream, controls frizz, helps prepare hair for styling with flat iron! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I got a bad perm about a year ago (yes, people still get perms, they just don&#x27;t talk about it) and I was mortified to be seen.  I tried every deep-penetrating, moisturizing, reconstructing, hydrating, uber-products on the market.  I started using the K-PAK line and it really helped a lot, but I still had a fairly harsh level of frizz.  I found this product at my neighborhood Ulta store and tried a sample size.  Not only was it the best thing that ever happened to my poor, abused hair, but that little 2 oz. sample has lasted me 6 months.  This is better than any of the silicone products out there (I&#x27;ve been a big fan of the Chi silicone product for years).  It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down, and it doesn&#x27;t attract gunk out of the air like the silicone products do.  I just can&#x27;t express how awesome this product is.  You would never see my hair today and know it was damaged or even that it wasn&#x27;t a lovely, soft, natural wave.  It works great with a blow-out too...</li>
    <li> Smells great and works great! I received a free sample and had to purchase a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AWESOME! really helps with frizz, it smells amazing.. no complaints! I think it&#x27;s the best frizz product I&#x27;ve ever used. Really worth the money!</li>
    <li> Soft hair, not heavy, controls my curls</li>
    <li> A reorder, several times over!</li>
    <li> Stay far far away from this product and the others in the no frizz line.  The smell is horrendous and after using it for 3 days it began burning my scalp and eyes while giving me a massive headache. After washing several times with clarifying shampoo the symptoms subsided, but now my scalp is flaking and still a little sore and itchy. I emailed the company asking for a refund, and I have never heard back from them. I have used probably hundreds of products in my hair and I have never had an experience like this.</li>
    <li> This cream controls frizz like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s a lotion consistency and it takes a small amount to get my somewhat wavy hair to behave.  It&#x27;s very light and would also be perfect for curly hair.  It has no silicone so it&#x27;s somewhat of a mystery how exactly the frizz is controlled, but it works and that&#x27;s all I really care about.  I have a lot of medium/fine hair and this cream is the perfect antidote to the Florida heat and humidity.  I get no frizz whatsoever and my hair is soft and shiny with a nice amount of hold.  And the hold lasts all day and into the next.  I usually air dry my hair overnight (after apply the Living Proof Prime Style Extender and this styling cream) and then sometimes use a curling iron in the morning.  I can&#x27;t feel either of the products in my hair at all, they are very light yet strong.  The primer keeps my hair clean longer and the styling cream (along with the curling iron) gives me defined waves that stand the test of time.  My hair has never looked or felt better.  I also like the No Frizz Styling Spray, which does approximately the same thing.  It controls frizz and gives me great hold.  I use the Perfect Hair Day shampoo and conditioner and love them.  They give me the perfect amount of hydration, volume and frizz control and they keep my hair clean for several extra days.  None of these products weighs my hair down the least little bit, not even the styling cream.  If you&#x27;re looking for something that will eliminate frizz, is light and won&#x27;t attract dirt and oil like silicone, then you should try these products.  They are absolutely amazing!!  Like I said, I&#x27;ve never used anything like them.  I&#x27;m a LP convert for sure.  I highly recommend this styling cream and all the LP products I&#x27;ve mentioned.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my hair.</li>
    <li> As written by my lovely wife:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine curly hair, and this product works great. It has the consistency of a lotion. For years I&#x27;ve been looking for and trying various products to get my curls to behave. I apply mousse on my wet hair then allow to air dry. Once dry, I use this product. It reduces frizz and leaves my curls soft and moisturized. I have tried it alone, but feel it doesn&#x27;t have enough hold to keep my curls in place and the frizz controlled. I&#x27;ve received quite a few compliments on my hair lately, and haven&#x27;t been doing anything else different. Will stick with this product.</li>
    <li> I live where it snows and it is very dry in the winter.  My hair has fine texture, and I have a lot of it.  I wear down jackets (I&#x27;m allergic to wool) and my hair was picking up so much static, it looked like I had put my finger in a lightbulb socket.  This product eliminates the static.  My hair is chin length and I use about the size of a dime on damp hair, after everything else (shampoo, conditioner, etc).  It does NOT weigh my fine hair down.  It doesn&#x27;t look greasy.  And it controls static.</li>
    <li> This stuff is good but a little too pricey.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even know I had any frizz in my hair until my stylist used this product on me.  It made my hair look and feel so polished.  I have very straight hair already and it never occurred to me to use something like this, but ever since that revelation at the salon, I want to use this every day.  The best thing about it is that you can use quite a large amount of it (if needed) and it doesn&#x27;t look greasy or make your hair feel funny after your blow dry it.  Icing on the cake:  it. smells. amazing.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, I buy it over and over again.  If you think the price is kinda high, it&#x27;s really not, you only need a little dollop so it lasts a super long time.</li>
    <li> Living proof works for me. The best product out there. Try it and see. They also give samples!</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find the perfect product for my hair.  I haven&#x27;t decided if I will buy again, just based on price.  But it works pretty good.</li>
    <li> works super well does not make your hair stiff just makes it really manageable great for people with curly hair and yep no frizz great product :)</li>
