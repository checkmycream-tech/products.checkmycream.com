      <li>It&#x27;s Paul Mitchell, what&#x27;s not to love!</li>
      <li>My Chi Shine Infusion gives more shine!</li>
      <li>so I want it to stay looking nice without needing a touch up.  </li>
      <li>and it was by far the best hair spray I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>I have used PM Freeze and Shine for many, many, many years!  </li>
      <li>This is the best spray for people with short hair that want their hair to stay in place.</li>
      <li>Love the comments and the product.</li>
      <li>Used it for some time and love it.</li>
      <li>Love the smell; it reminds me of my childhood.  </li>
      <li>and I love it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok, but I&#x27;ve used much better sprays that are cheaper.</li>
      <li>I Love this hairspray, but the bottle I received, the spray nozzle did not work from day one.  </li>
      <li>Hope they never stop making this product because it remains my favorite for over 25 years.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that it&#x27;s taking more and more to hold my hair in place.  </li>
      <li>and I love it,</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and it holds the style.  </li>
      <li>Genuine product.  </li>
      <li>THIS is the ONLY hair spray I have found that is reasonably priced and works excellent!  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find that to be true on either count.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described, thank you!</li>
      <li>Thanks !!</li>
      <li>Also, when I use any other hairspray, I&#x27;m once again reminded of how much I love the shine super spray.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sad that this happened, as I used to love the hold and loved that it didn&#x27;t build up on my hair.</li>
      <li>I would buy large refill bottles</li>
      <li>I feel like almost all hairsprays are the same, so smell is important.</li>
      <li>I really like this spray.</li>
      <li>It really holds your set.  </li>
      <li>It gives a nice hold without being too stiff.</li>
      <li>I have tried others and end up wasting them or giving them away only to go back to my tried and true Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine Super Spray!</li>
      <li>The hairspray feels watered down and it doesn&#x27;t smell like true Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine Super Spray.</li>
      <li>But this time around I needed a new sprayer!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll have to start looking for a new hair spray!  </li>
      <li>Nothing more, nothing less.</li>
      <li>Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine Super Spray is definitely NOT it.  </li>
      <li>I have been a faithful user of Lanza Urban Elements Finishing Freeze and Lanza Art Elements Total Recall for more years than I can remember.  </li>
      <li>When its really humid in Michigan, not often, it feels a bit heavy, but nothing helps in real high humidity for fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have fine straight hair and this is the only stuff that adds volume and holds without weighing it down.</li>
      <li>Maybe it was old, not sure, but did not seem like true Paul Mitchell</li>
      <li>As a busy professional, I don&#x27;t bother with my hair after initially fixing it in the morning</li>
      <li>My hair is fine in texture yet curly and this Paul Mitchell product has a flimsy hold and makes my hair look dull.  </li>
      <li>This holds all day, through sleep and into the next day, and leaves your hair feeling soft.  </li>
      <li>look if you put it on wet hair, or you can scrunch it after it&#x27;s dry, and it will look soft and natural, no stickiness.  </li>

<li> The past year or 2</li>

<li> I get compliments on my silver hair all the time and this spray turned it to a darker, dull gray.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t like a pump as it is hard for me to distribute it evenly in my hair.</li>
<li> I am not sure if it was damaged&lt;br /&gt;in shipment, or was just not right to start with.  :(</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t know if I got a bad bottle, so that&#x27;s why I continued to purchase it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product arrived on time.  I like the way this gives my hair a heathy looking shine.  It gives a nice hold without being too stiff.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairspray ever!</li>
    <li> not as shine as what I get at the store.</li>
    <li> I thought that since it is Paul Mitchell, it would be good. However, it isn&#x27;t. The freeze doesn&#x27;t last long and there&#x27;s really no shine. My Chi Shine Infusion gives more shine!</li>
    <li> This holds all day, through sleep and into the next day, and leaves your hair feeling soft.  I am always told my hair smells so good when I wear this.</li>
    <li> Leaves a crunchy texture on hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very expensive and it doesn&#x27;t hold very well. I noticed that there is a bit of hold in the beginning, but as the hours pass by, I noticed that the hold is no longer there.</li>
    <li> This is great hair spray.  It really holds your set.  I received it promptly and it was well packaged.  Another great product from Paul Mitchell.</li>
    <li> I have thin, straight hair and it&#x27;s hard to style.  When I get it styled, I want it to stay that way.  As a busy professional, I don&#x27;t bother with my hair after initially fixing it in the morning so I want it to stay looking nice without needing a touch up.  THIS is the ONLY hair spray I have found that is reasonably priced and works excellent!  I have tried others and end up wasting them or giving them away only to go back to my tried and true Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine Super Spray!</li>
    <li> Love the smell; it reminds me of my childhood.  Also, seems to work well.  I feel like almost all hairsprays are the same, so smell is important.</li>
    <li> I have used PM Freeze and Shine for many, many, many years!  The past year or 2 I&#x27;ve noticed that it&#x27;s taking more and more to hold my hair in place.  I didn&#x27;t know if I got a bad bottle, so that&#x27;s why I continued to purchase it.  I would buy large refill bottles so I wouldn&#x27;t run out or stock up on it when it was on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is NOT the same!  It has to be watered down or a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; formula.  I&#x27;ll have to start looking for a new hair spray!  I&#x27;m sad that this happened, as I used to love the hold and loved that it didn&#x27;t build up on my hair.</li>
    <li> want your hair to stay where you put it?  This is the product for you.  Dries quickly, and stays perfectly.</li>
    <li> I Love this hairspray, but the bottle I received, the spray nozzle did not work from day one.  The hairspray also smells a bit different than what I usually buy at the salon.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase through the internet again, but would stick with a Salon.</li>
    <li> I really like this spray.</li>
    <li> I have used Paul Mitchell Products since 1992 and continue to use them now.&lt;br /&gt;Love all that I use.</li>
    <li> Excellent value.  Genuine product.  Very pleased with everthing involved in this online purchade.</li>
    <li> I have been using Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine for several years.  I have fine hair and it holds the style.  When its really humid in Michigan, not often, it feels a bit heavy, but nothing helps in real high humidity for fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my girlfriends come to visit me and they use this product, they are all impressed with how good it works on all type of hair.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years....actually I often buy it by the gallon and refill my bottles.  But this time around I needed a new sprayer!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years. It is what I knew it would be, and what I expected.  Nothing more, nothing less.</li>
    <li> Happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I have been a faithful freeze and shine user since 1987! I have fine straight hair and this is the only stuff that adds volume and holds without weighing it down. The best!!!</li>
    <li> Leak hole in the bottle</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and I love it, but I think I&#x27;ll stick to purchasing at the salon. This bottle came already opened and did NOT have the smell that I&#x27;m used to. Maybe it was old, not sure, but did not seem like true Paul Mitchell</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Paul Mitchell, what&#x27;s not to love!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 15+ years and I love it; however, I will not purchase it again from this vendor. The bottle I received was already opened and the spray nozzle doesn&#x27;t work. The hairspray feels watered down and it doesn&#x27;t smell like true Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine Super Spray. It also doesn&#x27;t feel the same in my hair...it leaves a crunchy texture to my hair.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. She does not want to use any other hairspray. She states it is not heavy and harsh on her hair.</li>
    <li> Have been using this hairspray for 10 + years. Absolutely love it.  I have curly hair (perm), and it makes the curls last all day with no frizz.  Also, you can go with a &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; look if you put it on wet hair, or you can scrunch it after it&#x27;s dry, and it will look soft and natural, no stickiness.  Also, a few years ago, my daughter was a flower girl.  The hairdresser sprayed her dry hair (down to the middle of her back), let it dry, then curled her hair and put it in a partial up-do, and it lasted the whole day! Also, when I use any other hairspray, I&#x27;m once again reminded of how much I love the shine super spray.  Pleasant, somewhat fruity scent, not that nasty smell of other sprays.</li>
    <li> I have been a faithful user of Lanza Urban Elements Finishing Freeze and Lanza Art Elements Total Recall for more years than I can remember.  I started using it back in my 20&#x27;s and it was by far the best hair spray I have ever used.  So now, I&#x27;ve used up the last of my stash and since it&#x27;s been discontinued, I&#x27;m on the hunt for a hair spray that is comparable.  Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine Super Spray is definitely NOT it.  My hair is fine in texture yet curly and this Paul Mitchell product has a flimsy hold and makes my hair look dull.  It&#x27;s as if I&#x27;ve not even used any hair spray at all.  I will just keep looking.</li>
    <li> smells great and works!</li>
    <li> This is the best spray for people with short hair that want their hair to stay in place. It does not make your hair stiff and holds well. Have been using it for years!</li>
    <li> Hope they never stop making this product because it remains my favorite for over 25 years.</li>
    <li> the pump on this spray works some times....kind of a disappointment.  I am not sure if it was damaged&lt;br /&gt;in shipment, or was just not right to start with.  :(</li>
    <li> This hairspray was recommended by my hairstylist. She said it held all day and wasn&#x27;t sticky. I didn&#x27;t find that to be true on either count. It&#x27;s ok, but I&#x27;ve used much better sprays that are cheaper. I don&#x27;t like a pump as it is hard for me to distribute it evenly in my hair. I get a glob here and nothing there. I also noticed that rather than make my hair shine, it made it look darker. I have sliver salt and pepper hair and people started asking me if I had colored my hair because it looked darker. I get compliments on my silver hair all the time and this spray turned it to a darker, dull gray. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairspray I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I use this spray on a daily basis.  It brushes out after your day is through.  People have asked me where do you have your hair done, it&#x27;s so shinny.  Love the comments and the product.</li>
    <li> Great product to keep your hair where you need and want it!</li>
    <li> Liquid leak!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like Packing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but product is best...</li>
    <li> you can&#x27;t beat this stuff.</li>
    <li> Used it for some time and love it. Only brand I use.</li>
    <li> Super shine with great hold!</li>
    <li> I will only use this to keep my curl after styling for days. Thanks !!</li>
