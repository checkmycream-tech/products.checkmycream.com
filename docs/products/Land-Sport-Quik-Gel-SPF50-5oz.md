      <li>Bullfrog Quik Gel is the best sunscreen that I&#x27;ve found for intense sun exposure yet.</li>
      <li>I love Bullfrog Quick Gel!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is by far the best sunscreen I have ever used.</li>
      <li>so my skin doesn&#x27;t want to \\&quot;drink\\&quot; in any more liquid.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>it also doesn&#x27;t have that greasy feel that many sunscreens have and dries a lot faster.  </li>
      <li>I love</li>
      <li>I use it mostly when playing tennis or when on a long-distance motorcycle trip.</li>
      <li>Most sunscreens never seem to absorb into my skin at all.</li>
      <li>I was able to purchase it online with Amazon.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I found this stuff.</li>
      <li>But that doesn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;Overall an excellent SPF-50 suntan lotion.  </li>
      <li>The drug stores don&#x27;t seem to carry this any more.</li>
      <li>I have also used the spray kind and had success, but I feel like I get better coverage with this</li>
      <li>Take it from someone that burns way too easy</li>
      <li>Bullfrog is the best sunblock hands down.</li>
      <li>It disappears quickly and does not leave a film like many products we have tried.</li>
      <li>So he tried the Quik Gel, primarily because the advertising says &amp;#34;quick drying.&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to have on my face especially because it dries without looking like you have sunscreen on.  </li>
      <li>Not only does this do a great job protecting me from the sun</li>
      <li>The important thing is that this stuff will last a good 4-5 hours, that it is not noticeable on your skin, and doesn&#x27;t have that greasy feel.</li>
      <li>I really like to use it on my face because it doesn&#x27;t cause me to sweat more, and it doesn&#x27;t run and get into my eyes.</li>
      <li>When he was able to get sun BLOCK in a tube, it worked very well.  </li>
      <li>The only drawback is that, since most stores do not carry the type I like any more, I have to order it online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The gel is quick drying and never feels greasy.  </li>
      <li>This is a much appreciated addition to inventory of things that make my life as easy as one would like to have it.</li>
      <li>By far, our favorite sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I developed my love for Bullfrog a couple decades ago when I was a surf bum in Costa Rica.</li>
      <li>but it is worth ordering.</li>
      <li>It is soft on the skin without being greasy, but my favorite thing about it is that once it is on, it does not come off with perspiration.</li>
      <li>It does leave a slightly sticky tactile feel to your hands, but a good washing and wiping takes care of that.</li>
      <li>It is a gel and seems to contain a lot of alcohol, so it actually mostly dries (stays a tiny bit sticky) on my skin and doesn&#x27;t just float away when I get in the water.</li>
      <li>This product has prevented sunburn on me in the hot Boca Raton Summer sunshine for&lt;</li>
      <li>As a person who depends a lot on external sources for my professional fulfillment, I am very satisfied.</li>
      <li>I sweat extraordinarily heavy and Bullfrog still works -- allowing my sweat to naturally exit and still providing me great sun protection.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite modern formulation, and it no longer is being carried at my local Walgreens.</li>
      <li>It has a very medicinal, alcohol smell and even if you don&#x27;t get it IN your eyes,&lt;br /&gt;it could sting them at first when used in close proximity.  </li>
      <li>Most sunscreens never seem to dry on me no matter</li>
      <li>As a female with fine hair, I can dab this gel on my head so I won&#x27;t burn and can avoid wearing a hat</li>
      <li>Everyone else is ready to hop in the water after about 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>So for now I will stick with Bullfrog Quik Gel for my face and just put it on very carefully.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The gel really works , if you remember to put it on .</li>
      <li>I REALLY don&#x27;t want to get this stuff in my eyes (</li>
      <li>I also have sensitive skin that sometimes seems to get a chemical burn from certain sunscreens.</li>
      <li>If you put it on 20 min before you go in the water it will last thru a whole day in the hot Texas sun at a water park.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not so quick to dry, but it protects him from sunburn.</li>
      <li>Especially while rowing my venetian gondola, in the intense South Louisiana Sun!</li>
      <li>I have very pale skin and burn easily, so I have to use a high SPF sunscreen if I&#x27;m going to be outside for more than a few minutes.</li>
      <li>I hate getting sunburned and really worry about getting skin cancer in the future, but burns just seem to happen to me once in the while despite my best efforts!</li>
      <li>Product was half full.</li>
      <li>and it is barely noticeable.  </li>

    <li> Got it because I was tired of dioxide white pasty skin. It works, but is way too expensive to use daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get do better with cost, and not having the white paste look. Just shop around.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years on my doctor&#x27;s recommendation, but it&#x27;s hard to find on the shelves.  Good, non-greasy product.</li>
    <li> bought for use this summer, 4th summer on Bullfrog</li>
    <li> This product has prevented sunburn on me in the hot Boca Raton Summer sunshine for&lt;br /&gt;years.  It has a very medicinal, alcohol smell and even if you don&#x27;t get it IN your eyes,&lt;br /&gt;it could sting them at first when used in close proximity.  But that doesn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;Overall an excellent SPF-50 suntan lotion.  It&#x27;s what I always use.</li>
    <li> I developed my love for Bullfrog a couple decades ago when I was a surf bum in Costa Rica. This is my favorite modern formulation, and it no longer is being carried at my local Walgreens.

    <li> By far, our favorite sunscreen. It disappears quickly and does not leave a film like many products we have tried.</li>
    <li> The only sunscreen used by my husband who was badly burned in a building fire collapse.  He is a retired firefighter, after 30 years of service.</li>
    <li> I love Bullfrog Quick Gel!!! I was a lifeguard for a few years when I was younger and used it on a daily basis and never burned!!  I have very fair skin and this is the only product I can rely on.  Now I take it on vacations all over.  I went to Aruba last year and sadly forgot to pack it.  This reminded me how good Bullfrog is because I was toast within 5 min. of being there.  LOVE THE BULLFROG!!!</li>
    <li> Product was half full. It was obvious the product had been used before. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Bullfrog is the best sunblock hands down. If you put it on 20 min before you go in the water it will last thru a whole day in the hot Texas sun at a water park. All we have used and hope they never stop making it!</li>
    <li> I have found this product  to be the best for me . The gel really works , if you remember to put it on .</li>
    <li> Received sunscreen.  Ordered sunblock, payed 19.99.  Not happy.</li>
    <li> I discovered this sunscreen in a pharmacy several years ago. The only drawback is that, since most stores do not carry the type I like any more, I have to order it online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best sunscreen I have ever used. It is soft on the skin without being greasy, but my favorite thing about it is that once it is on, it does not come off with perspiration. With every other sunscreen I have used, if I sweat within 15-30 minutes of application, the sunscreen comes off my skin. The Bullfrog sunscreen does not; as long as my skin is dry when I apply it, it is on—and one application lasts all day.</li>
    <li> The drug stores don&#x27;t seem to carry this any more. This is the only product that works for my husband and kids.</li>
    <li> I will purchase again... it prevents sunburn except for the fact that it&#x27;s a little bit oily and leaves a white film when you rub it on your face.</li>
    <li> This is a much appreciated addition to inventory of things that make my life as easy as one would like to have it. As a person who depends a lot on external sources for my professional fulfillment, I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have issues with sunscreen. I have very pale skin and burn easily, so I have to use a high SPF sunscreen if I&#x27;m going to be outside for more than a few minutes. Most sunscreens never seem to absorb into my skin at all. When I go swimming with other people, we all put waterproof sunscreen on at the same time and wait a few minutes for it to dry. Everyone else is ready to hop in the water after about 10 minutes. I&#x27;m still a wet and greasy mess. Most sunscreens never seem to dry on me no matter how long I wait--when I finally do get in the water, the sunscreen floats off in a big cloud and my skin is left to burn. It&#x27;s very frustrating and has also led to me getting sunscreen in my eyes on more than one occasion. I am not sure why this is; the only thing I can guess is that it must be because I stay well hydrated so my skin doesn&#x27;t want to \\&quot;drink\\&quot; in any more liquid. Who knows? I also have sensitive skin that sometimes seems to get a chemical burn from certain sunscreens. I&#x27;m not sure why that happens and haven&#x27;t identified the specific chemical(s) that bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Bullfrog Quik Gel is the best sunscreen that I&#x27;ve found for intense sun exposure yet. It is a gel and seems to contain a lot of alcohol, so it actually mostly dries (stays a tiny bit sticky) on my skin and doesn&#x27;t just float away when I get in the water. It also does a great job of preventing sunburn. I have worn it to all-day outdoor events and even to a water park once and didn&#x27;t get the slightest hint of a burn. I always wear a long sleeved shirt, a hat, sunglasses, and reapply sunscreen every 1-2 hours when I&#x27;m outside all day, but even with all that I used to burn anyway. Not with this Bullfrog! I&#x27;m so glad that I found this stuff. I have also used the spray kind and had success, but I feel like I get better coverage with this gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this sunscreen is the thing that makes it so great--the alcohol content. It irritates my skin a little (but doesn&#x27;t cause a chemical burn) and is a bit scary to use on my face. I REALLY don&#x27;t want to get this stuff in my eyes (the fumes alone irritate them when I put it on my face)! I have experimented with using different sunscreens on my face and the Bullfrog everywhere else; last time I did that I ended up with a burnt nose and cheeks. I hate getting sunburned and really worry about getting skin cancer in the future, but burns just seem to happen to me once in the while despite my best efforts! So for now I will stick with Bullfrog Quik Gel for my face and just put it on very carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also found a great sunscreen for when I just need light sun protection. It&#x27;s [[ASIN:B00468L19G JP MOMENTS SPA 34.0 oz Body Lotion WITH SPF 15 By JEROME PRIVEE]], and it also seems to absorb into my skin well.</li>
    <li> We haven&#x27;t been able to find this in the stores anymore, and are very thrilled to find it online here. The gel is great because it does not have a greasy feel. I really like to use it on my face because it doesn&#x27;t cause me to sweat more, and it doesn&#x27;t run and get into my eyes.</li>
    <li> Take it from someone that burns way too easy this is the best sunscreen.  Since I discovered this product two years ago I always use it when I am going to be in the sun for extended periods of time.  I&#x27;ve used it at the Lake, on float trips, at sports games/tailgates, and have made it through the day without getting a sunburn (I do sometimes put it on multiple times throughout the day).  Not only does this do a great job protecting me from the sun it also doesn&#x27;t have that greasy feel that many sunscreens have and dries a lot faster.  It is a bit expensive and not a lot of places have it but it is worth ordering.</li>
    <li> Bullfrog sun block was recommended for my husband by his dermatologist.  When he was able to get sun BLOCK in a tube, it worked very well.  And then it&#x27;s no longer in the stores.  So he tried the Quik Gel, primarily because the advertising says &amp;#34;quick drying.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s not so quick to dry, but it protects him from sunburn.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used bull frog sunscreen for quite awhile, and have always found it very effective. This year I could not find it locally, despite looking in 5-6 area stores. I was able to purchase it online with Amazon. It came quickly, was fairly priced, and it works great. I love Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;Don</li>
    <li> This stuff works great, surf all day and don&#x27;t get burned.</li>
    <li> I use this sunscreen for tennis, walking, sitting at outdoor events, etc.  The gel is quick drying and never feels greasy.  I am spoiled with this sunscreen and have used it for 25 years.  As a female with fine hair, I can dab this gel on my head so I won&#x27;t burn and can avoid wearing a hat and it is barely noticeable.  It&#x27;s great to have on my face especially because it dries without looking like you have sunscreen on.  It has very good protection but you will still get a little tan over time when wearing it (actually, I am used to the 35 spf so cannot fully comment on the 50 spf).  They used to sell Bullfrog in grocery and drug stores but I cannot find it there any longer so am now buying online.  I love this product. I am not a water person so cannot comment on that other than going into a pool occasionally - it works well.</li>
    <li> I have used this produce and have been very satisfied with it ever since my Dermatologist recommended it to me over 20 years ago.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  Especially while rowing my venetian gondola, in the intense South Louisiana Sun!</li>
