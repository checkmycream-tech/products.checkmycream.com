      <li>I can do a lot more with my hair when I use this product.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Better price with subscribe and save than any retail store even if you have a coupon.</li>
      <li>love this for my hair</li>
      <li>and I love it</li>
      <li>On top of that it&#x27;s baby-fine, because, well, she&#x27;s a baby.  </li>
      <li>It is my favorite hair product that I&#x27;ve ever used, and I continue to use it every day.</li>
      <li>Best anti frizz product for curly dry hair.</li>
      <li>I use it to smooth out the bottom layer of my hair around my neck that tends to look tattered and frizzy without it, and some on the top of my head to decrease frizz.  </li>
      <li>It washes out easily with baby shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this for anyone and everyone, as it gives me a good hair day any time i use it.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would work, but it&#x27;s just fine.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found applying it when hair is slightly damp yields best results.</li>
      <li>I have long curly hair only Herbal Essences Products do the job &amp; the new Herbal Essences Touchably Smooth Anti-Frizz Creme Hair Care is the best of the best!!!!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it doesn&#x27;t make my hair as smooth as I would like.</li>
      <li>It helps comb my hair smooth and keeps the ends from frizzing when it dries.</li>
      <li>Herbal Essences Touchably Smooth</li>
      <li>The first time I used it on dry hair it was wonderful.</li>
      <li>but my first one I knocked off the counter and the whole top part of the bottle broke off and spilt every where ,which is my fault, but my point it I ordered another one because I liked the product.</li>
      <li>On the rare occasion that I wear my waist-long tresses down, this is my go to product to keep my curls on their best behavior!</li>
      <li>this product works great; I have a 7-year-old daughter with long hair</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s rich and creamy.  </li>
      <li>I do still need to use another product for a final smoothing, but this provides a good &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; for smooth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and dries quickly.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this product.</li>
      <li>This was one more &amp;#34;experiment&amp;#34; and I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  </li>
      <li>It also has a VERY intense smell that lasts for the entire day, which is good unless you&#x27;re planning to use perfume.</li>
      <li>It moisturizes my hair pretty good, I use it daily</li>
      <li>This really helps to smooth it out.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So, itchy scalp worth no frizz?&lt;br /&gt;Not really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It leaves my waist length high lighted hair very soft, smooth and frizz free without build up or a greasy feel!</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve tried other anti-frizz creams and this one is as good as any out there.</li>
      <li>It kind of works when I put it in dry hair, but not as well as the Paul Mitchell Skinny Serum</li>
      <li>(itchy scalp, greasy look if too much is used, and I&#x27;m not talking about gobs!</li>
      <li>I swear this is the best product that I have used in my hair to soften it - and mind you, my hair texture after a wash is scary to deal with.  </li>
      <li>I have permed hair and if I use this product alone, it&#x27;s still pretty frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t find this product to really do anything to my hair other than make it smell nice.</li>
      <li>I kind of &#x27;scrunch&#x27; it to apply, which helps keep hair&#x27;s shape without weighing it down.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too strong, I wish they made different scents.</li>
      <li>I bought it on a whim, not expecting much as it is Herbal Essences, but it wowed me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That said, if you put on too much, your hair looks a bit greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
      <li>so I can get one fast or have one in stock, very convenient.</li>
      <li>very long.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair.  </li>
      <li>would give this 5-stars, but it doesn&#x27;t travel very well.  </li>
      <li>Love the non frizzy look this gives without that crunchy wet look.</li>
      <li>My hair gets really frizzy in humidity, but this takes care of it, plus it is not sticky.</li>
      <li>It really helps me control her hair without battling brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I first bought this when I was looking for a replacement for my Biosilk serum that wouldn&#x27;t make my hair look oily and wasn&#x27;t as expensive, and I could not be more pleased with this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Keeps my hair from fizzing. Works great</li>
    <li> love this for my hair</li>
    <li> Very good product. Better price with subscribe and save than any retail store even if you have a coupon.</li>
    <li> This product makes me hate my hair a whole lot less.  My hair gets very dry, frizzy and tangled- especially in the winter.  It&#x27;s really straight and utterly refuses to hold a curl without a lot of product.  I can do a lot more with my hair when I use this product.  I have spent years hating it and have tried lots of gloss drops and anti-fizz sprays.  This is a good one.  It&#x27;s rich and creamy.  It&#x27;s light and dries quickly.  Once it dries it&#x27;s not sticky or crunchy.  It doesn&#x27;t weight down my hair or make it look like a grease fest.  This is definitely a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my toddler&#x27;s hair.  She inherited my frizzy, tangle-prone hair.  On top of that it&#x27;s baby-fine, because, well, she&#x27;s a baby.  This helps me get her cowlick and flyaways under control.  It washes out easily with baby shampoo.  It really helps me control her hair without battling brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this 5-stars, but it doesn&#x27;t travel very well.  When it arrived, the top was popped off.  Some of the product had leaked out, but most of it remained in the can.  I didn&#x27;t think it would work, but it&#x27;s just fine.  I&#x27;d rather it was in perfect condition, but it&#x27;s still good.  I might skip the Subscribe and Save for this product and buy it locally.</li>
    <li> The smell is very nice and florally .&lt;br /&gt;-Applies nicely to damp hair&lt;br /&gt;-defines curls&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;However it doesn&#x27;t keep my natural hair soft once dry.</li>
    <li> Smells Good! Like the way it wont frizz my hair too!</li>
    <li> Even if this product did absolutely nothing for frizz control, I&#x27;d use it for the incredible scent!  It makes my hair smell like magic for days and helps keep my mane from turning me into a fuzzy headed ninny muggings!  It is light enough to be applied to dry hair, carefully of course, but has enough staying power to be applied to wet/damp hair.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel sticky or crunchy or greasy like other creams have and I adore the pump dispenser.  Definitely a product I recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the way these Herbal Essence products smell and they work great on my hair.</li>
    <li> I use a little when I straighten my hair to make it smooth and soft. I also use it as my &#x27;curling&#x27; cream (I use a lot morw this way) because I don&#x27;t like the crunchy feel.feel . of mouse or gel. I got soft bouncy curls. I am sad I cannot find it in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> First, this smells wonderful. I wouldn&#x27;t use it just for the smell, but it is a plus! I color my hair, which has led to it being dried out and frizzy. This really helps to smooth it out. I apply after towel drying and prior to blow drying. I do still need to use another product for a final smoothing, but this provides a good &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; for smooth.</li>
    <li> excelent! my hair es very soft.</li>
    <li> Not greasy, smelled nice. My hair wasn&#x27;t frizzy but it broke out my back and neck. Will not be using again.</li>
    <li> Perfume for the hair, smells great, very moisturizing and works great on curly hair</li>
    <li> It kind of works when I put it in dry hair, but not as well as the Paul Mitchell Skinny Serum I used to use. It also has a VERY intense smell that lasts for the entire day, which is good unless you&#x27;re planning to use perfume. I&#x27;ve got thin hair and was hoping this would help with the flyaways. For now I&#x27;ll go back to Paul Mitchell and keep looking for other products.</li>
    <li> Never did get a chance to try it. The bottles was broken and all the contents spilled inside the box. The product isn&#x27;t expensive enough for me to bother sending it back.</li>
    <li> This smells awesome!! It leaves my waist length high lighted hair very soft, smooth and frizz free without build up or a greasy feel! I am all about hair products and have gone very expensive with enjoy product etc and I find my way back to this working and feeling the best! Sometimes cheaper is better! Love it!! :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for curly hair like mine to keep it from frizzing out. It is creamy and similar to the old Dove extreme anti-frizz creme that I used for years until they discontinued it. However, it tends to get on my face a little bit and it makes my skin feel kinda oily and weird and then it makes me break out. If you wash it out before going to bed then you&#x27;ll probably be fine, even if you have sensitive skin like mine, but usually I&#x27;m too tired when I come home.</li>
    <li> Becarful not to drop it. I have used herbal essences for years, this was a recommendation from amazon and I love it but my first one I knocked off the counter and the whole top part of the bottle broke off and spilt every where ,which is my fault, but my point it I ordered another one because I liked the product.</li>
    <li> I use the on the ends of my hair. Works beautifully.</li>
    <li> So good using it every morning and it l kills all my frizz like i wanted</li>
    <li> It moisturizes my hair pretty good, I use it daily and when I run low it&#x27;s om my subscribe and save list so I can get one fast or have one in stock, very convenient.</li>
    <li> Not a good solution for frizzy hair. Is heavy and does not do much for my hair. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I first bought this when I was looking for a replacement for my Biosilk serum that wouldn&#x27;t make my hair look oily and wasn&#x27;t as expensive, and I could not be more pleased with this product. It is my favorite hair product that I&#x27;ve ever used, and I continue to use it every day. It has a creamy texture, but does not weigh down my hair or make it look oily. I use it to smooth out the bottom layer of my hair around my neck that tends to look tattered and frizzy without it, and some on the top of my head to decrease frizz.  The price also can&#x27;t be beat.  I hope they never stop making it!</li>
    <li> Was so surprised with how much I like this stuff.  I generally hate having product in my hair, but this stuff does not leave my hair heavy or greasy &amp; it just enhances my curls, like it is supposed to!</li>
    <li> Amazing and perfect product for my naturally curly hair. I absolutely love this stuff. The first time I used it on dry hair it was wonderful. My hair was smoother and softer. I was happy. I also tried it with my hair wet and it made it soft and silky once it dried. I recommend using it first on wet hair. I was so happy. I would definitely recommend this to anyone with curly and frizzy hair. If you do buy it make sure to use at least 5 pumps of this stuff because it doesn&#x27;t dispense much out.</li>
    <li> This helps my hair to be not so frizzy. I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it doesn&#x27;t make my hair as smooth as I would like. But let&#x27;s be honest- it&#x27;s probably more a problem with my hair than the product!</li>
    <li> I have tried every anti-frizz treatment under the sun and this is by far the best stuff. I bought it on a whim, not expecting much as it is Herbal Essences, but it wowed me. My hair gets really frizzy in humidity, but this takes care of it, plus it is not sticky. I have even tried the PHYTO stuff from sephora. I would highly recommend this for anyone and everyone, as it gives me a good hair day any time i use it. And it is so cheap!</li>
    <li> I swear this is the best product that I have used in my hair to soften it - and mind you, my hair texture after a wash is scary to deal with.  Thank you a Herbal Essences.</li>
    <li> Miracle worker. LOVE it.</li>
    <li> Compliments of a recent date...&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Usually I just smell hair product. Your hair smells fresh in a &amp;#34;I spent all day in the sun and wind&amp;#34; kind of way.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Yup, I&#x27;ll be ordering more of this stuff.</li>
    <li> Herbal Essences Touchably Smooth Anti Frizz Cr&amp;egrave;me works better than other anti frizz products I&#x27;ve used, and leaves my hair soft, instead of crunchy.</li>
    <li> Smells delicious and even though it&#x27;s not mind-blowing it does the trick and I like it ! I love it.</li>
    <li> this product works great; I have a 7-year-old daughter with long hair and she can actually use it herself and make her hair look nice; it works great to get out the frizz that my daughter has in the morning!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair.  I have permed hair and if I use this product alone, it&#x27;s still pretty frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people commented about the smell.  I don&#x27;t smell all that well but even I don&#x27;t care for the over floral scent it gives off.</li>
    <li> Smells great and does the job</li>
    <li> Smells great! I love this!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I can&#x27;t stand conditioner, i feel like i never get the slimy feeling out of my hair. I use this after showering, leaves my hair bouncy and soft even as much as i color it.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product. I have tried it a few different times now hoping for different results. The only thing that I find is that it is very slimy and I don&#x27;t know if it is just weighing down my hair or actually taking the frizz out of it. When I jump back into the shower I can feel the slimy texture of the product coming out of my hair. I wish that it gave different results.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t stop the frizz.</li>
    <li> Ehh it&#x27;s alright. I don&#x27;t find this product to really do anything to my hair other than make it smell nice. I think last time it was used was because my boyfriend ran out of styling gel and this was the only thing he could use.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much more than tame frizz. I thought it would keep my hair smoother as well like a leave-in conditioner but it doesn&#x27;t. I would suggest getting Tresemme&#x27;s leave-in conditioner. It tames frizz and keeps your hair from knotting and it&#x27;s at the same price. This stuff DOES tame your hair though. Just not as well as a conditioner.</li>
    <li> It keeps my frizz tamed all day and makes my hair smell really nice! The only down side is that I have to add more the next day since I only wash my hair every other day.</li>
    <li> It really does leave my hair feeling soft and looking smooth--quite a feat! It does what expensive salon products never did for my hair.</li>
    <li> Love it! Best frizzy serum</li>
    <li> Makes my hair smooth I can&#x27;t wear it down without this product! Great for straightening hair as well even if its not heat resistance input it on after I straighten.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been scratching my head, wondering why the heck my scalp itches! Well.... it&#x27;s this stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does do what it says...gets rid of the frizz, IF you use plenty of it at one time.&lt;br /&gt;So, yeah, won&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, if you put on too much, your hair looks a bit greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Then if you put in enough, your scalp itches but your hair won&#x27;t be frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, itchy scalp worth no frizz?&lt;br /&gt;Not really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll just use this stuff til it runs out, on the ends of my hair, but I will keep it from my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend it?&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;It works if you use lots of it.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s got &amp;#34;side effects&amp;#34; (itchy scalp, greasy look if too much is used, and I&#x27;m not talking about gobs! I&#x27;m just talking about a bit more than just a squirt)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking elsewhere for my hair care product needs.</li>
    <li> I have coarse, wavy hair that gets very frizzy in Florida&#x27;s humidity.  I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products from dollar stores to high end.  This was one more &amp;#34;experiment&amp;#34; and I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by this product!  It leaves my hair much less frizzy; in fact, it&#x27;s soft and smooth without getting hard or greasy.  I love it and will continue to use!</li>
    <li> Best anti frizz product for curly dry hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this for her very long hair and she loves it!</li>
    <li> I have long curly hair only Herbal Essences Products do the job &amp; the new Herbal Essences Touchably Smooth Anti-Frizz Creme Hair Care is the best of the best!!!!</li>
    <li> My two girls love this stuff. It has a nice scent and works great. We&#x27;ve tried other anti-frizz creams and this one is as good as any out there.</li>
    <li> Helps control the frizz factor in my mid-back length, wavy hair in central FL humidity. Helps settle the gray monsters around my face... somewhat! I&#x27;ve found applying it when hair is slightly damp yields best results. If hair is too wet, the moisture breaks down the product, diminishing its effects. I kind of &#x27;scrunch&#x27; it to apply, which helps keep hair&#x27;s shape without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> My favorite anti-frizz product! I have naturally curly hear that I usually wear tied up to prevent excessive volume in humid weather. This is the perfect product to smooth the flyaways on my crown without the stickiness of mousse. This works well for a lighter washing schedule, too. I prefer to shampoo my hair only twice a week to keep my hair from drying out. This product allows me to do that without the uncomfortable product buildup that would otherwise occur on the scalp with mousse. On the rare occasion that I wear my waist-long tresses down, this is my go to product to keep my curls on their best behavior! Somewhere between a leave-in conditioner and a mousse, this is a must-try for anyone with curly or frizzy hair!</li>
    <li> Seems to work ok, but I can&#x27;t get past the floral smell. It&#x27;s too strong, I wish they made different scents.</li>
    <li> Love the non frizzy look this gives without that crunchy wet look. This I have found lasts all day and then some for me.  I would recommend!</li>
    <li> I use this when i get out of the shower before I comb my hair. It helps comb my hair smooth and keeps the ends from frizzing when it dries. Sometimes I put a dap on the ends in humid weather when it is about half dry too as added protection from frizz. Another good product is pantene smoothing creme.</li>
