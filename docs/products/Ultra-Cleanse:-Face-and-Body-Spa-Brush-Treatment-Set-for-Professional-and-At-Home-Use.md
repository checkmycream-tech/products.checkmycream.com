      <li>My face looks amazing and the brushes are very good quality.</li>
      <li>When I saw this brush on Amazon.com with a couple of good reviews, I decided to get it.   </li>

      <li>Better than a washcloth.</li>

      <li>OK, so I&#x27;m a guy</li>
      <li>I guess the fact that having something that cleans my face with bristles (which probably is a heck of a lot more thorough than hands alone) makes me want to believe that this product makes me better off than before.</li>
      <li>(would be much better if it came with string--</li>
      <li>I recently bought this as a birthday gift for my best friend&#x27;s birthday.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>And I would love to offer it to my clients in my skin spa.  </li>
      <li>I also noticed that because of this cleaning routine my face cream and lotion absorbs better.  </li>
      <li>and feeling very soft and beautiful.  </li>
      <li>They cost more than they do here, but I see a lot of complaints that the heads sold here are lower-quality than the original.</li>

      <li>This is a fabulous product.  </li>
      <li>I bought the Dermatouch brush at TJ Maxx and ordered replacement brush heads that fit (pumice stone, sponge and body brush) from TEI Spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this despite already owning the [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>Cheap soldering job.</li>
      <li>Enjoy.</li>
      <li>A far superior product is the Clarisonic.</li>
      <li>I love it so much I have bought two more to give as Christmas gifts.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t very powerful and</li>
      <li>pretty much love it and use it every morning.</li>

      <li>I stand by my original assessment, but I will say that I switched cleansers to original Noxzema.</li>
      <li>brush is still running on the original set of batteries.</li>
      <li>and it still wasn&#x27;t great but a little better.</li>
      <li>My face feels really clean and it does the job.</li>
      <li>just though I was getting my face clean with a washcloth.</li>
      <li>This is the third face brush I have purchased and it is by far the best.</li>
      <li>I just received the Tei spa cleansing brush and WOW do I love it!  </li>
      <li>and I guarantee you will love it as much as I do.</li>
      <li>But if used as part of a comprehensive facial cleansing routine, then I do think my skin feels good after using it.</li>
      <li>Batteries last a good while as well.  </li>
      <li>Not bad for the price</li>
      <li>I spent quite a bit of time researching similar items and found this to have some of the best and most consistent reviews-and they are spot on!  </li>
      <li>The first time I put the FOUR batteries in, I thought it didn&#x27;t rotate very quickly.  </li>
      <li>, this brush is more abrasive and does a much better job at exfoliating.e such as after a chemical peel, though I don&#x27;t see it for sale as a replacement brush anywhere.</li>
      <li>The difference is tremendous.</li>
      <li>I have blemishes on my face and it helped me tremendously.</li>
      <li>Overall, I am very pleased with this brush.</li>
      <li>I liked this product because of the long battery life, it&#x27;s convenient, and replacement brushes are really cheap (around $4).</li>
      <li>After the very first time using this product my face felt so (almost unusually) soft that my husband and I kept touching it in amazement.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Now, for the most important part: the facial brush.</li>
      <li>I do recommend SOME kind of facial brush, battery operated or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found the face polishing sponge thing useful, but I do use the two brushes and the pumice stone.</li>
      <li>so I decided to call the seller directly for more information.  </li>
      <li>It would be nice if the companies offered different textures of brush heads.</li>
      <li>This wasn&#x27;t really worth the money to me.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a great little brush for only $25ish. I have blemishes on my face and it helped me tremendously. I liked this product because of the long battery life, it&#x27;s convenient, and replacement brushes are really cheap (around $4). The only real con that I had is it doesn&#x27;t have a holder so it can be awkward to find a place it put it when you&#x27;re done. Overall, I am very pleased with this brush.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and within 3-4 days my skin was so soft, you can use it on your face, whole body, anywhere and it gently exfoliates. The only downside is the batteries don&#x27;t last as long as i&#x27;d hoped. I am a natural redhead and have very sensitive skin, as long as you use sensitive products, your skin will feel like butter.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this as much as I should.  but when I do, I am always happy with the results.</li>
    <li> This scrub brush really does do the job. The brush attachments actually rotate/spin and do a great job at cleaning / exfoliating. I&#x27;m really happy with it. I had an issue with an attachment not fitting properly and was promptly replaced / resolved by the seller. Very professional and prompt customer service. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been more than pleased with the quality of this product, especially for the price when compared to similar products from other sellers. Originally I was nervous about the facial brush being harsh but am pleasantly surprised with how gentle it actually is. It does such a better job removing makeup from my face than just a washcloth. It&#x27;s disgusting to think about how much residue I used to leave on my face. I also think it&#x27;s noteworthy to say how great the customre service is at TEI Spa.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to buy a rotating facial brush, but did not want to spend over $100 for one.  When I saw this brush on Amazon.com with a couple of good reviews, I decided to get it.   I have been real happy with it.  I don&#x27;t have any experience with any other facial brushes to compare it with, but I would not hesitate to buy it again.  The only difficulty was with getting the cover off the handle to put the battery in, and that is the only reason I have given it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> I am truly happy with the item. I am also very happy to recommend the seller.  Something was holding me back at first to purchase this facial brush kit so I decided to call the seller directly for more information.  The lady that answered the phone was very helpful and informative- that was that kind of service that closed the deal.  I purchased this product mainly because of the fact that it has a rotating head which is what I was looking for.  Unit has one speed (on/off).  The tool unit is very easy to handle in the shower.  At first the facial brush bristles were a little stiff for my taste but in time it got \\&quot;broken in\\&quot;.  This can be a problem with an individual who has sensitive skin but if you don&#x27;t, nothing beats the facial cleaning action of it, same goes with the body brush attachment.  I get out of the shower with the greatest \\&quot;awake\\&quot; feeling, my skin is glowing and very clean!  I also noticed that because of this cleaning routine my face cream and lotion absorbs better.  When I first saw the foam attachment, I thought to myself it looks useless.  Boy was I wrong!  Before I purchased this tool, I use to use my hands to apply my face cream, after application my face feels and looks greasy, so shiny which is really bothersome since I need to blot out my face after. Now I apply a little face cream to the foam attachment and it distributes the cream evenly all over my face and neck. After wards doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, not shiny, my face just looks polished.  Also this means that I save more money and products since I only need a little amount of it to get the job done.  I have not tried the pedicure attachment yet.  Will write another review after I have tried it.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  I was looking for a body bush tool and it&#x27;s rotating actions really helps get off old skin.  My only complaint is that the battery door is difficult to get off but that is because it&#x27;s water tight.  The price was also fair for the quality.</li>
    <li> I love this facial brush. The brush spins, and it comes with 4 attachments to do facial cleansing, facial exfoliation, body brushing, and a pumice for feet. It is water resistant and you can use it in the shower. My face looks amazing and the brushes are very good quality. I tried the exfoliation brush with a facial scrub product and it felt EXACTLY like microdermabrasion I&#x27;ve had. I know with regular use my face will look better than ever before since it looks so great during the first week. It was also the best priced unit for what you get.</li>
    <li> I just received the Tei spa cleansing brush and WOW do I love it!  I used both the brush and the buffer and my face already feels and looks fresher and brighter.  I can&#x27;t wait to try the other heads to see what they will do!  The head actually spins rather than just vibrating and you really do feel the difference.  I spent quite a bit of time researching similar items and found this to have some of the best and most consistent reviews-and they are spot on!  Try it, for the price and the effectiveness and I guarantee you will love it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> Seriously, my face squeaks from being scrubbed so clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s funny that TEI Spa attempts to warn consumers that theirs is the \\&quot;one and only\\&quot; rotating face brush when this brush is actually sold by at least 3 companies as [[ASIN:B004NJ8WFO Face and Body Ultra Clean Brush 4-in-1 SPA Cleansing System, Waterproof and Cordless]], [[ASIN:B004BASKAC g-maher Waterproof Rotating Face and Body Cleaning Kit]] and Dermatouch Skin Perfecting System. They are all the same and the brush heads are interchangeable. The Dermatouch brush comes with a normal brush head (same one that is sold by TEI Spa and g maher) and a feathery soft gentle brush head. Unfortunately, Dermatouch has non-existent customer service and does not respond to emails or live chat messages so I suggest getting the brush from one of the other sellers. I bought the Dermatouch brush at TJ Maxx and ordered replacement brush heads that fit (pumice stone, sponge and body brush) from TEI Spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this despite already owning the [[ASIN:B001SERK9G Pretika SonicDermabrasion Facial Brush]]. The brushes have two different technologies so its easy to justify the need to try both. The Pretika vibrates and this one spins. I was disappointed in the seemingly wimpy face brush bristles at first but the rotating action helps make it more abrasive. Only one speed but I think its perfect and wouldn&#x27;t want it any slower. I like that it is waterproof so I can use and leave in the shower. It was difficult to get the cap off to insert batteries, but it helps to tie something thru the hole in the bottom (like a shoelace) and use that to pull the cap off. I&#x27;d rather have it tight and secure to keep water out than easy to remove and risk having it ruined by water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pretty much love it and use it every morning. It would be nice if the companies offered different textures of brush heads. I would love to try a slightly firmer one. And the super soft gentle one that came with the Dermatouch brush feels great when my skin is sensitive such as after a chemical peel, though I don&#x27;t see it for sale as a replacement brush anywhere. The body brush is too soft in my opinion and should be made firmer. The handle seems unnecessarily big but this is not a big deal. Compared to the [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]], this brush is more abrasive and does a much better job at exfoliating.e such as after a chemical peel, though I don&#x27;t see it for sale as a replacement brush anywhere.

Compared to the [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]], this brush is more abrasive and does a much better job at exfoliating.</li>
    <li> This is the third face brush I have purchased and it is by far the best. I love it.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t really worth the money to me.  It wasn&#x27;t very powerful and when pressing down to scrub it seemed to lose it&#x27;s power.</li>
    <li> The ultra Cleanse Face &amp; Body Spa Brush could use a little more power. It bogs down a little if you put too much pressure on the face brush and just a little pressure slows it drastically when using the bigger body brush. I put known new batteries that hadn&#x27;t been in the package for an unknown length of time and it still wasn&#x27;t great but a little better.Just keep a light touch and keep it moving in a circular motion and it will do a decent job.  I am glad I have it after all that. I get less ingrown hairs on my face, and I now glow. How wonderful!  [[ASIN:B001MURXP2 Ultra Cleanse: Face and Body Spa Brush Treatment Set for Professional and At Home Use]]</li>
    <li> I have used my cleanser twice and while it does do a fair job it has no holder to place it in once you finished using it. So you have to lay it on the counter in all it&#x27;s wet mess. And it runs on 4 double A batteries so after using it for a few minutes it starts to slow as it runs out of charge and since it doesn&#x27;t come with a charger either you will need to keep plenty of batteries on hand. It does have a small hole in the bottom, perhaps for a sting to hang it up but it didn&#x27;t come with a string.   Overall, I don&#x27;t think this product was very well thought out.</li>
    <li> This product was bought for my wife, she use it with her ProActive to keep her face and skin&lt;br /&gt;looking and feeling very soft and beautiful.  What a great combo!&lt;br /&gt;Pastor in Detroit</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price but I am sure the more expensive Clarisonic performs much better. I find the body brush could be softer.</li>
    <li> it was a gift -can&#x27;t answer</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a really fussy person and find this tool a wonderful item well worth its money! Love it and will use it when travelling overseas!</li>
    <li> This was $54 when I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One drop in the shower and both wires broke off from the motor. Cheap soldering job. (No one&#x27;s ever supposed to drop it? With wet, soapy hands?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried soldering the wires back on myself -- both ways -- and still didn&#x27;t work. (New batteries.) Which tells me it wasn&#x27;t just the soldering that was cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the brush connector was bent out of shape. So even if I got it to work again, the brush wouldn&#x27;t have stayed on.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product.  I have been using it nightly for 9 months and the original batteries are still going strong.  The soft bristle brush do not over-dry skin or irritate in any way.  I high recommend this product. Enjoy.</li>
    <li> After the very first time using this product my face felt so (almost unusually) soft that my husband and I kept touching it in amazement. Not that my skin was rough to begin with but the extra smoothness was still quite noticeable. My large pores looked smaller. It left a nice tingly feeling, and although this goes away rather quickly, it does make it seem like my face is much cleaner than with soap and wash cloth alone.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant, but did alot of homework and ended up buying this product.  It works perfectly on the face.  It&#x27;s definitely a good buy for the money.  By the way, I went to Vitacost.com and bought some Derma-E brand microdermabrasion cream to use with this scrubber and that works like a charm on my face as a scrub.  Good product for the money!</li>
    <li> I am in my mid 30&#x27;s and still fighting acne. When I began working out regularly in June, my acne went into overdrive. I expected that, but it didn&#x27;t subside after the first few weeks. It was getting to the point that I was beginning to be embarrassed to go out in public. I felt like people would think that I was dirty because my skin looked like crap, when that couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth. I was very diligent about cleaning my face twice daily (especially immediately after working out), drinking lots of water, and eating mostly clean, but it still felt oily and dirty right after cleaning. After much shopping around and debating on what type of brush (oscillating or sonic), and exactly which model to get, I chose this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not get mine from Amazon, but I did read a lot of the reviews here to help with my decision, hence my choice to review it here. The brush came very well packaged, and it is a sturdy and well-made product. If I had received it as a gift, I would have been very pleased with the presentation (Now that I think about it, it was a gift to myself. I feel loved!). My brush has a purple handle, and the box, instruction pamphlet (The instructions are well-written in proper English, by the way.), and sea salt scrub tube all have purple accents. Personally, I don&#x27;t care about the color, but since this is a review, I figured that it was worth mentioning. (edit: I see that the product picture has since been updated to match this description. Previously, it was different.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the four heads and batteries, it came with some sea salt scrub. While the packaging states that you can use the scrub with the brush, I wouldn&#x27;t advise it unless you have tough skin. I tried it, and while it didn&#x27;t cause any damage, I felt that it was too much abrasion for my face. It does have a very pleasant citrus smell, and I like to use it at times when I&#x27;m washing my face, but not using the brush. Since that is not very often, I can&#x27;t speak to the effectiveness of the scrub alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself works great. I&#x27;ve had it for about two months, and the original set of batteries is still going strong. It has a nice heft with the batteries installed. I do use it in the shower and again in the evening, and haven&#x27;t had any water-related problems, although I do store the brush elsewhere so that it can dry out completely between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the other heads, I have only used the pumice stone, so I will speak on that. It works, but in my opinion, a spinning stone is not the best way to go. It was very difficult to hold it in place and target exact areas (Rounded pumice spinning on round heels &#x3D; not good). Perhaps if it spun a bit more slowly, it would work better for that, but then that would probably negatively impact the way the other brushes work. I&#x27;ll stick to my non-powered stone for heel care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the most important part: the facial brush. It is a bit stiff, but it works very well for me, and it does fit in the crevices, like the nose area. When I use it, my face gets much cleaner than manual washing with cleanser and a washcloth. The difference is tremendous. I use my brush with Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Acne Solutions cleaner, with some Miracle II soap and neutralizer added. That has been my cleanser of choice for quite awhile.  I have worked up to using it twice daily. I wish I had taken some &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; pictures when it arrived! The difference in my skin tone is amazing. However, I still have one or two bumps at a time, and several backed-up pores. It seems to be the same few problem pores that get backed up repeatedly (I manually squeeze out the contents, and they usually don&#x27;t get infected and become pimples, but they do keep coming back.), but I feel that perhaps I should have gone with a sonic brush, as they claim to break up blockages below the surface of the skin, in addition to surface cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up, this brush works extremely well forexfoliating and cleaning the surface of your skin, but that&#x27;s as far as it goes. If you want a below-the-surface deep cleaning, keep looking.&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;-UPDATE- 12/2/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is still running on the original set of batteries. When it was time to replace the head, I ordered some directly from the manufacturer of this brush. They cost more than they do here, but I see a lot of complaints that the heads sold here are lower-quality than the original. The ones I got were of equal quality, and they charge a flat shipping rate, so you can defray that cost by ordering more heads at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stand by my original assessment, but I will say that I switched cleansers to original Noxzema. I brush my face as soon as I get in the shower, and don&#x27;t rinse it off until it&#x27;s time to get out. Love the smell, and it&#x27;s much less drying than the Burt&#x27;s bees. It&#x27;s also more effective at keeping the bumps at bay. YMMV&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;-UPDATE- 9/22/15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over two years later, my brush is still going strong. I think I&#x27;ve changed the batteries a total of three times, and the head several more times than that. I revisited this review to say I did have one issue, and it was easy to fix. The battery cover (the bottom part of the handle) is held on by a black rubber O-ring, which is also what makes it waterproof. Over time, it has worn out, so that I had to handle the brush very carefully to keep the batteries from falling out in the shower. I finally took the old one to my local hardware store and got a replacement that was slightly smaller in diameter, yet a tad thicker. Cost me all of forty cents. It&#x27;s 1/16th of an inch thick, and I believe the outer diameter is 9/8ths of an inch (I looked at several different diameters before choosing one, and now they&#x27;re all mixed up in my head, so I could be wrong on the diameter, but they all had the same thickness, so I&#x27;m certain about that part.). Anyway, I got it home and installed it and the battery cover fits on snugly. I&#x27;ve shaken it a few times with the batteries in, and I&#x27;m confident that I won&#x27;t be having that problem again, at least not for another couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another lesson that I have learned in this time is not to boil the brush heads. I tried to do that to sanitize them and extend the life. They didn&#x27;t melt, but the part that attaches to the motor warped, which caused the head to rotate unevenly.&#x27;s as far as it goes. If you want a below-the-surface deep cleaning, keep looking. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -UPDATE- 12/2/13  The brush is still running on the original set of batteries.

    <li> I recently bought this as a birthday gift for my best friend&#x27;s birthday. She said that she loves it. It&#x27;s great for her skin type as she struggles with oily skin.</li>
    <li> OK, so I&#x27;m a guy and I love that this brush has a grey handle instead of a pink, lavender, ect. But on to the mechanical operation. First off, this brush produces great results. My face feels really clean and it does the job. However, as a guy- my skin may not be as sensitive as the ladies; so with that said, I would have preferred a brush with at least two speeds. The one speed setting I find to be pretty slow, especially if you plan on using the body brush for exfoilating/polishing. With that being said, I&#x27;ve read plenty of other reviews stating other brushed are no faster then this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase...</li>
    <li> I LIKE IT BUT I WONDER CUZ I APPLIED IT FOR THE 2ND TIME , IT DELIVERED TO ME NOT COMPLETE I DIDN&#x27;T FIND ITS BUTTERIES AND SALT SCRUB AS BEFORE !!!</li>
    <li> And I would love to offer it to my clients in my skin spa.  Speed, texture of brushes, everything is great.</li>
    <li> I do like this product...but battery operated gadgets don&#x27;t last long with me...becomes a bit slow, tired of replacing batteries.</li>
    <li> My face feels so much smoother and cleaner. I just though I was getting my face clean with a washcloth. This product proved me wrong. I love it so much I have bought two more to give as Christmas gifts. I recommend this for anyone. I also notice after cleaning my face, my moisterizer absorbs quicker. It would be nice to have a holder for it but the holder wouldn&#x27;t clea my face. So no big deal to me.</li>
    <li> wow!!!! what a difference a day makes. THis is the best product money can buy and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ANY YOUNG WOMAN PURCHASE it</li>
    <li> this is the second one i bought for my wife, she hates it the motor inside dies as the warentee runs out</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product was worth buying or not. I lean towards saying yes, but I&#x27;m not sure if I see a big difference in my skin. I still break out, but it hasn&#x27;t gotten worse. I guess the fact that having something that cleans my face with bristles (which probably is a heck of a lot more thorough than hands alone) makes me want to believe that this product makes me better off than before. I haven&#x27;t found the face polishing sponge thing useful, but I do use the two brushes and the pumice stone. The brushes are fine (anything tougher would hurt probably); pumice stone is a bit too smooth for rough feet. It&#x27;s a pretty sturdy product-- I&#x27;ve dropped it a number of times in the shower, and the batteries come flying out (would be much better if it came with string-- it has a hole for it), but I just dry the batteries, put them back in, and the thing works again. It would be great if this were rechargeable, because I don&#x27;t like to go through batteries. But I&#x27;ve been using the brush for a month and am still using the batteries that came with the brush, so I shouldn&#x27;t complain. I use the brush every-other day though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall impression: not necessary since it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing much for me, but it was under $50, &amp; I could afford it so why not.</li>
    <li> I just received this cleansing brush in the mail and have used it once a day for three days.  I&#x27;ve never used one of these brushes before and I&#x27;m disappointed.  I was expecting that my skin would feel refreshed and invigorated after using it but it didn&#x27;t feel anything.  I can achieve the same results with a washcloth.  I have moderate acne, and I was hoping that this brush would help clear my skin by cleansing it more thoroughly.  I will continue to use it, but I don&#x27;t really expect any results.  If I am wrong and this brush does help my skin, I will come back and revise my review.  On the other hand, I may just save myself a small fortune in batteries and use the washcloth.  One last thing: I read the little user instruction pamphlet that came with the product.  It would seem to me that if you want to manufacture a quality product to sell in the U.S., then you ask someone who speaks English fluently to proofread your material.  How can I think highly of your product when there are at least 5 spelling and grammar mistakes in the first 7 sentence paragraph?  To me it just makes your product seem unprofessional and cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;I said I would come back and edit my review if I thought the product was better than my original impressions. I use it once a day and have been for the last five months. It&#x27;s grown on me.  By itself, it&#x27;s not the end all be all.  But if used as part of a comprehensive facial cleansing routine, then I do think my skin feels good after using it. Better than a washcloth. I am still on the original batteries and they don&#x27;t appear to be slowing down yet. I did look at ordering new brushes...they only cost $4 which is very reasonable...but the shipping is $4 too. I guess I&#x27;ll have to order more than one brush to make it worth my while to pay the shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to note that I have not used the body brush or the the sponge thing (what the heck is that for anyway? I threw mine away). I have tried the pumice brushbut that was pretty ineffectual.  I&#x27;ll just stick with the facial brush.</li>
    <li> Pretty good over all, but after a while the brush themselves break at the base where one attaching to the unit.  Just have a few of them around in case.  Batteries last a good while as well.  Recommended to anyone</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. I actually don&#x27;t use it often, may be once or twice a month. But the product does a very good job cleaning my skin when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;The price also is very reasonable compared to the price of other products out there.</li>
    <li> I bought this with a groupon in October.  The first time I put the FOUR batteries in, I thought it didn&#x27;t rotate very quickly.  Then my daughter showed me her Olay skin brush. It rotates much faster, and gets the job done quicker.  I do recommend SOME kind of facial brush, battery operated or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the days progressed, the brush kept spinning slower and slower.  I mean, within the week, it was rotating noticably slower. I may as well have just a non battery operated facial brush.  The thing takes four batteries, and this is how slow it is? It was also very difficult to get the battery cover off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed in the operations of this &#x27;skin care system&#x27;.  I would not recommend it. I&#x27;m going to purchase the Olay brush when this one runs out.  From what I can see, that won&#x27;t be too long, and it will be cheaper too.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed - it does not go around fast enough for the buffer one.  I need it to remove callusus from my foot.</li>
    <li> Is a wonderful product for the whole body it is best with my night creams and favorite soaps in the shower now that I have one it is something that I can not live without. It runs off two batteries and it cleans my skin like no other.</li>
    <li> This only spins in one direction and if held with even the slightest pressure it stops spinning. Because the product was purchased on Amazon I can&#x27;t return it. A far superior product is the Clarisonic. It&#x27;s more money but at least it works. Clarisonic can be purchased at Sephora.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for something to give your skin a little glow then this is the product. I use it once a week or every two weeks with an exfoliator and my skin always looks super glowy and soft afterwards.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase. The price does not reflect the quality. I feel like I bought a $200 item! My skin is already clearing up &amp; I&#x27;ve only had it for a month now. I just hope the co. is around when I need attachment refills in the month ahead!</li>
