<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like this even better than I thought I would. I didn&#x27;t realize when I bought it that it has an opening down the front middle, which is perfect for my fingers to reach in and remove my round makeup-remover pads. It sits in my medicine cabinet and I use it every single day when removing my eye makeup and when putting on toner after washing my face. I love this dispenser......no more searching through my bathroom drawer to try to grab a round remover pad from its plastic bag!</li>
    <li> This could not be more perfect!  Great design and execution.  The lid stays on firmly, and it has a nice weight.  Neat, efficient way to store cotton rounds.  They&#x27;re protected, yet easy to get to.  I keep mine in my medicine cabinet, but it would make an attractive addition to a vanity.  Not cheaply made or cheap-looking at all.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous ordering this, but the price was right, so I took a chance.  I didn&#x27;t run in to any of the problems some previous reviewers mentioned.  The lid on my fit fine, and there were no scratches. The cotton rounds fit in there very nicely. I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> So tired of finding these necessary little pads all over my bathroom. I have now have contained in a wonderful, neat little holder that keeps them clean and handy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my new round cotton pad dispenser! It has a lid on top for refilling and a opening on the side to dispense the cotton rounds; yet closed enough to keep them free of dust and hair spray. It is made of an attractive transparent durable acrylic material and is easy to clean. The fact that it is clear makes match perfectly with any of your bathroom decor. AAA+++++</li>
    <li> super easy to use, lightweight and durable! I was so surprised by the quality once i took it out of the box. It came a day sooner than i expected, i would buy again.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything special about this cotton pad holder when I bought it - after all, it&#x27;s just a plastic cotton pad holder.  But when I opened the box, I was shocked to find myself so excited about a simple bathroom organizer.  It&#x27;s very heavy, high-quality acrylic - you can tell it&#x27;s a good grade acrylic the minute you see it.  It is heavy and sturdy and looks and feels more like glass than plastic.  The lid fits snugly on the top, and it looks terrific on the bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> This looks nice on the counter, it&#x27;s sturdy, and makes it so easy to grab a cotton round. Goes with any decor.</li>
    <li> well, i like it okay but the lid wasn&#x27;t fitting properly as the cylinder was too small- in order to fit the lid on i had to stretch the cylinder and it has cracked. it functions okay but now has an ugly crack down the side.</li>
    <li> This is such an easy to use and attractive cotton round holder.  It is weighted so that it stands upright and doesn&#x27;t fall over easily and makes my bathroom counter look more organized and neat, as well as keeping my cotton rounds clean (I used to store them under my bathroom cabinet in the bag they come in and it was somewhat of a hassle to get just one out when needed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refilling it is easy as is removing one: cotton rounds slide in through the top to refill.  They are dispensed through a slot along the side of the dispenser.  It may be ridiculous by I so like this little dispenser.  Is it really worth $10?  Probably not, but I&#x27;m glad I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: purchased a second one shipped from internetsales13&lt;br /&gt;The one received from this seller is was not an authentic product.  He went out of his way to resolve the issue by providing a replacement.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it supposed to do...allow easy access to cotton rounds while keeping them tidy and organized in storage. It took a second to get the cap on, but it won&#x27;t come off easily, which I like.     It&#x27;s plastic of course and not glass; still, it&#x27;s a little cheaper looking/feeling than I anticipated (although, the price is relatively inexpensive).     If I were to do it again, I&#x27;d probably go with something a little nicer for the same price or a little more.    Overall, I can&#x27;t complain and I will make use of it.</li>
    <li> exactly what I needed.  Easy to grab cotton round with the opening right there on the front.  It&#x27;s a very sturdy piece, not too light.  I really love it.</li>
    <li> I love this cylinder for my cotton swaps it works great int he bathroom and keeps things organized.</li>
    <li> What can I say, other than the fact that this nifty little thing is fantastic for storing round cotton pads.  It looks very nice, not at all cheap or chintzy as I had feared.  I highly recommend this item - it sure beats seeing a plastic baggie of Swisspers on the counter!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this dispenser. I have it on our bath counter with my cotton pads in it. I use the cotton pads to remove my eye makeup. Its so convenient. The opening on the side allows you to just pull out your cotton pad &amp; go. The clear acrylic material is a nice &amp; clean design. I gave it 4 instead of a 5 star because i wish it was a little bigger so I didn&#x27;t have to refill it as often.</li>
    <li> Gorgeously easy to use and looks so cute</li>
    <li> Like another reviewer before me, I am not totally certain that I received the authentic product. My experience was nothing like these enthusiastic reviews (which convinced me to purchase this item to begin with). What I received is a really cheaply made cylinder that does not stand up without wobbling weirdly on the countertop. (A piece of jagged plastic leftover from the mold is sticking out of the bottom and impossible to remove without a saw of some kind. This is the cause of the weeble-wobbling cylinder.) Others seem charmed by the gap designed to make grabbing swabs easy, but I just find it odd and it bothers me to think of all the yuck-ness that could be finding its way onto the exposed pads. It&#x27;s not really worth returning. I&#x27;ll probably donate it, maybe someone else will have a mini-hacksaw or a really rough piece of sandpaper to smooth down that bottom. Definitely not my fave Amazon buy.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality, perfect size and compliments the layout display of my double sink bathroom. Would definitely recommend if you are looking to have your cotton pads handy and nicely organized</li>
    <li> I like to over organize everything, so when I found this, I had to go for it. It works well and helps get rid of clutter and packaging!</li>
    <li> This dispencer is just what I needed to keep me from handling the whole bag of cotton pads. I really like and keeps me organized.  Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I am pretty organized and when I was looking for something to help me keep my bathroom organized I found this for my cotton swabs I use to take my make up off. Perfect!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that one side of this was open, when I ordered it from a different source.  The photo here is better.  The cover is completely removable, which makes it easy to refill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cylindrical container has both the appearance and weight/heft of quality, and seems durable.  This is not the fragile, lightweight type of plastic.  However, if I were to drop it on a concrete floor, it would likely crack, I&#x27;m guessing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the shape:  Lately, when shopping for cotton cosmetic pads, either the local store only has square ones, or the square ones happen to be more affordable on that day, and that&#x27;s what I gotten.  So now I have square-shaped cotton crammed into the round-shaped dispenser, with corners protruding a little from the opening in the side wall. It still works OK; it just doesn&#x27;t look quite as nice as it would with the round cotton.</li>
    <li> Keeps my cotton pads neatly stacked and more accessible than before.  It also gives my vanity space a nicer, cleaner look.</li>
    <li> The top does not even fit with out you physical pulling the two sides so the top can fit properly.     It is like getting a drink from the drive thru with out the top on propperly. I think it would be best if youspend the extra money and get something worth your money.     Horrible.</li>
    <li> Perfect for holding cotton rounds, easy to access when needed without fumbling with plastic bags.  Looks nice on counter, too.</li>
    <li> This keeps my cotton rounds neat &amp; organized. Next I will purchase a q-tip holder!</li>
    <li> Wow, this thing is great! I was considering making something like this for myself, but at this price, it&#x27;s far and away better than I could have constructed. My only gripe - and it&#x27;s a minor one - is that it won&#x27;t hold a full tube of cotton rounds. But this is an extremely small quibble, and I am very happy with it!</li>
    <li> dude, didn&#x27;t think a plastic tube to hold my cotton rounds would be the best thing ever. I really hated reaching into the plastic bag holding my cotton rounds, especially as i got towards the end of the bag. the top is very sturdy - and somewhat hard to put on and off - that&#x27;s how sturdy it is. and it&#x27;s very thick/hard plastic, so no worries of having to buy a new one ever.</li>
    <li> Item was shipped very fast and just as described.  Would do business with this person again.  Perfect addition to my bathroom counter top.</li>
    <li> I like it OK, but didn&#x27;t realize it is open in front.  The other one I had was all enclosed with a lid at the top for filling.  I think it is more sanitary to have them enclosed so they won&#x27;t get dusty or splattered with something.</li>
    <li> Very useful. Easy to place and take out the cottons. Lid is a little bit loose.</li>
    <li> I should have used a ruler. Somehow I imagined it would be as tall as the stack of cotton rounds I get in a bag, but it holds about 1/2 of the bag I get at target. It is a good product. It is thick plastic, so it seems durable. (like it might survive a drop or two) The lid fits snugly, and the cotton rounds sit nicely in the canister. It is better than just having a bag of cotton rounds on the counter. I just thought it would be taller.</li>
    <li> After searching everywhere for a cotton pad dispenser, I happened upon this one.  Very durable, a quality product. So glad I purchased this.  Fits perfectly in my cupboard and the plastic is sturdy.</li>
    <li> it fell once and cracked. Not the best quality of material Its open on one side. I would not repurchase it</li>
    <li> I bought this dispenser to hold cotton pads on my make up table, I got tired of taking bagged pads in and out of drawer twice a day.  This is the perfect solution.  It looks great on make up table and is functional as well.  You can remove pads without taking off top through wide opening and then turn dispenser around to hide opening.  I also bought Danielle square cotton ball holder to keep Qtips next to cotton pads.  They look great together and now everything is at my fingertips when needed.</li>
    <li> Finally a product for cotton pads that looks good and is functional for your vanity.  I bought two, one for my home and one for my vacation condo!  Love it!</li>
    <li> When i first ordered i didnt think nothing special of it, thought it was a regular plastic cylinder pad holder, butttt its made out of glass and it looks cute on my vanity desk , o gave it four stars bc i didnt realize it.was a bit small which is my fault for not reading!</li>
    <li> This product is perfect to keep in your bathroom. It performs it&#x27;s function of keeping all your round cotton pads and the container looks pretty nice. Not too cheap or plastic-y.</li>
    <li> Great, just wish the price point was a little more reasonable (seems expensive for plastic)</li>
    <li> Simple container to hold those little round flat cotton pads. My wife likes it just fine. Not sure what happened to the old one but whatever.</li>
    <li> This looks great, not cheap looking. It almost looks like glass but is very heavy duty acrylic instead. Pretty sitting out.</li>
    <li> Love this for my cotton. I still had a bunch of square cotton and put them in this and it works well. I&#x27;ll buy the round ones soon but square ones worked too. A great product.</li>
    <li> I rated it five stars because it does what you&#x27;re getting it for, and it looks nice. If you use round cotton pads every day, don&#x27;t hesitate--just buy it.</li>
    <li> Perfect transaction. Very nice product.</li>
    <li> The Daniellle Brand sent is beautiful and goos quality.  It is a compliment to my bathroom vanity area.  It also is a good size to fit into the cabinet. I appreciate good quality at a reasonable price ... Thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen many other reviewers complain about receiving an inferior quality item that wasn&#x27;t actually manufactured by Danielle. Sure enough mine appears to be counterfeit too. The item I selected was &amp;#34;Ships from and sold by Amazon.com&amp;#34;, but that won&#x27;t save you. My understanding is Amazon&#x27;s inventory system jumbles items together even if the manufacturer is different -- which appears to be happening here. In the same order I bought a square acrylic dispenser by Danielle and that one is beautiful and very high quality, with a crystalline finish and very tight tolerances. In contrast this one has a dull, scratched finish and sits crooked on its base. It is barely usable for purpose. If you want one of these I recommend going to the Container Store and getting a genuine one there.</li>
    <li> This thing holds a lot of cotton rounds! Has an exposed side so you can grab each cotton round without having to pick up the container and tilt it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t have to be doing the dance around with my cotton rounds, I was expecting it to be at least the same height as the rounds package, I do have to split it in two fills, but it makes my life so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;Just have it on my bathroom sink and it even looks like decoration.</li>
    <li> It holds make-up pads, but is a part of a set of items for the bathroom. We have the whole set and it looks and functions great.</li>
    <li> I paid $10.25 for the item thinking it&#x27;s a reasonable price (compared to the Container Store).&lt;br /&gt;This item is poorly made and of low grade plastic - the lid barely fits and had scratches when I opened it. I will try to return it.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something like this for a long time. I love it!</li>
    <li> Love it! This is a really really nice STURDY pad dispenser! I absolutely love it and would definitely recommend it to whoever that uses facial cotton pads daily! It&#x27;s really nice to have on your sink and be able to grab easily when needed. The material is really nice and sturdy and definitely not those flimsy plastic material. Definitely worth the buy!</li>
    <li> The lid kept falling off. I usually use a toner twice a day, so it wasn&#x27;t very practical to me.</li>
    <li> This holder is great!  I love it.  Instead of having a stack of cotton rounds falling over in my medicine cabinet there is now this lovely holder.  Cotton rounds slip in through the top, are dispensed through the slot on the side and never fall over.  The holder itself is heavy enough that it doesn&#x27;t move around when pulling out cotton rounds or bumping it when grabbing other items in the medicine cabinet.  It looks nice too.  True it doesn&#x27;t hold an entire tube&#x27;s worth of cotton pads but I have always had to store what wasn&#x27;t in the cabinet somewhere else. If the holder was taller it would be too big for my medicine cabinet shelf so it&#x27;s perfect for me.  Having this is a small thing...certainly nothing earth shattering but it makes the morning in particular just a litle bit easier and nicer.  Who doesn&#x27;t need that?</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it everyday.  I put pads in, and take out, from the open part rather than the top.  More convenient for me.  It keeps my facial pads organized and right at hand.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Quality and style go hand in hand with this stylish and very handy pad holder/dispenser!  Looks great in our bathroom!  Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to receive this product two days after I ordered it. It came in a plain white box with no markings on it. The same with the product itself - no label, just inside a plastic bag. I had a hard time putting the lid on until my husband showed me how to put it on. It is not hard to take the lid off once it is on, unlike what was experienced by other reviewers. I was going to keep it even though some reviewers claim that it is a fake and over priced product. It did suit my needs.&lt;br /&gt;However, when I received my other order, a Danielle Acrylic Cotton Ball and Cotton Swabs Holder, I clearly saw the difference not only in the packaging, but the products themselves. The box has a picture of the product, label and logo of Danielle creations. The product itself has a label on the bottom that shows it is an authentic Danielle product. Yes, both were made in China, but if you compare the two, it is very noticeable that the quality is not the same.&lt;br /&gt;The website description of this cotton pad dispenser is misleading. I do not mind an imitation as long as it is as good as the product being imitated. This is going back. Buyers beware! I definitely do not recommend buying this product!</li>
    <li> This is a very sturdy dispenser that I love. My only draw back is the security of the top, I wish it locked and twist. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Acrylic cotton pad dispenser is a best buy because it keeps the pads clean and in sight sitting on my vanity.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this dispenser.  Perfectly stores my cotton pads. Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had read some reviews and looked at the picture, but did not notice there was an opening in the front. I bought it for cotton balls, so I just stuffed them in there and hope they are not bothered by any dust before I use them. The top was hard to put on at first. Of course, it is cheap plastic like the cotton swab container I bought. They serve their purposes for the time being.</li>
    <li> This is simple but very handy, I chose it cause it was made of acrylic. It looks beautiful on my bathroom sink.</li>
    <li> I like this cylinder container to store my cotton pads in.  It has a lid with a knob on top.  I like the side opening that allows easy assess to the cotton pads without opening the lid.</li>
    <li> Great holster for cotton rounds on the bathroom counter. It is heavy enough that it won&#x27;t move around.</li>
    <li> This product is okay. But I think it is way overpriced.  I got it for the cotton pads but didn&#x27;t realize it had an opening in the front.  For half the price of this plastic one I got a couple of nice glass containers from the container store for the rest of my bathroom needs.  The lid is very hard to put back on once off.  Other than that it serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> Love it! It looks good and keeps my stuff organized.</li>
    <li> Great product, very clean lines and is a simple way to organize you bathroom and simplify your bathroom routine. I bought some cottons pads that were on sale before I saw the dispenser and by MY mistake they were the wrong size. So be sure to be patient unlike myself or get the average sized pads. Also the entire dispenser is clear, which is great cause it will match anything! Great quality product! Happy shopping!</li>
    <li> It looks wonderful on my vanity basin, now I don&#x27;t have to hide the plastic bag the cotton pads come in.  I just fill up the dispenser and leave it out to use.  The slot down the front is the perfect size to be able to pull out a cotton pad as you need it.  I have searched for a while for any similar containers that would do the same job, but have been unable to find any.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a sleek, good looking dispenser on show in their bathroom.</li>
    <li> I think it adds a professional look to my bathroom, and anything that makes my things vertical is good.    The only reason it got a 4 instead of 5 stars is that I was expecting the top to be chrome, but it is actually the same clear acrylic as the rest of the container.    Perhaps it was my bad for reading? :)  I still like the product, especially that I do not have to lift the lid off to retrieve a cotton pad.</li>
    <li> I was expecting this to be a really flimsy piece of plastic. Its far from it. I am very happy with how sturdy and strong it is. You can tell that it is thick. So far, I love it. No complaints. Def. looks more expensive than is.</li>
    <li> This item meets my expectations, and will store the items appropriately. It is well constructed, and will help with my organization.</li>
    <li> The container is exactly what I wanted and it is very functional.&lt;br /&gt;It beats pulling them out of a plastic wrapper everyday.</li>
    <li> I love this!! The front has an opening so all you have to do is just grab the cotton round out. It fits about one full package of rounds.</li>
    <li> Danielle Cylinder Acrylic Cotton Pad Dispenser:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* arrived packaged adequately: no damage or scratches&lt;br /&gt;* approximately 25% of tube is open to air&lt;br /&gt;  (I twist open portion towards wall to avoid hairspray, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;* provides easy access to contents&lt;br /&gt;* removable lid fits snugly&lt;br /&gt;* acrylic does NOT look or feel \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;* 8-inch height is great (not refilling so often)&lt;br /&gt;* Delon 100% Cotton Rounds (available on Amazon) fit perfectly&lt;br /&gt;* recommended: Yes!</li>
    <li> These are hard to find so glad I found one through a buyer on Amazon. Does the job, looks good on a bathroom counter. Like that it&#x27;s plastic in case it drops it won&#x27;t break like glass.</li>
    <li> I bought this and the matching cotton pad dispenser and they are both perfect. They look really nice together and keep my stuff organized.</li>
    <li> A great organizer that can hold cotton rounds. This is great for me because I use cotton rounds everyday. This keeps my things organized and ready to use when in a rush. The clear design matches any decor. It&#x27;s a pretty way to stay neat.</li>
    <li> Nice dispenser and holds a lot of product.  The lid of one doesn&#x27;t seat firmly into the dispenser, but not a big deal.  Good value, too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this cosmetic pad dispenser/holder.  No more fumbling with the ziploc packaging for what I need when my hands are wet.  It looks very nice on the vanity, and did I mention the acrylic is very high quality?  Looks like glass.  There is absolutely nothing cheesy about this.  Now that I have two bathrooms, I&#x27;ll purchase another.</li>
    <li> just what she wanted.</li>
    <li> The lid was a bit hard to lock on, but its great for the price and holds my cotton pads great.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in attempt to help clean up clutter on my bathroom sink while still keeping the items I use most accessible. This has done exactly what I needed it to do - hold cotton rounds. The open side makes it easy to grab one or two for use. When I travel, I toss the entire container into my suitcase, and then set it up on the sink at my destination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only holds about 3/4 of a standard size bag of cotton rounds. I&#x27;ve tried to shove the entire bag in there, but it just won&#x27;t fit. That&#x27;s really my only complaint.</li>
    <li> This item is just as pictured and very functional. Sturdy, well made and fits my cotton rounds perfectly. Great buy!</li>
    <li> The dispenser works great for its purpose, however, the lid does not fit it correctly. I ended up throwing it away from hassling with it. But for the price, it was worth the money.</li>
    <li> Took it out the box, filled it with my cotton pads and sat it on my vanity table. It looks just the way it does online and looks just the way I hoped it would on my vanity. It did seem like the lid wouldn&#x27;t fit for a moment but I just kept pushing it back down until it stayed and now it can come off and fit back into place without any problems. I see a few reviews where people are complaining about the front being open but the design makes sense to me. I can just reach in and slip a cotton pad out and when it starts to get low I won&#x27;t have to turn the container upside down to get the last few cotton pads out. I do think this maybe should have been 10 dollars instead of 15 but since it was exactly what I was looking for I was willing to pay the extra money.</li>
    <li> I really do like this product particularly the lid which has a snug fit. But I wish it was a bit taller so I could fit the entire stack of cotton pads rather than have a few stragglers.</li>
    <li> The open slit all the way down the tube allows for easy access of each pad, even those at the bottom.</li>
    <li> Looks beautiful, well made, and definitely serves it&#x27;s purpose. It&#x27;s made of nice thick acrylic. Ended up purchasing a second one for my mom!</li>
    <li> Happy I got this cotton pad dispenser it does not take up much space and now my cotton rounds are super organized.</li>
    <li> I really likes how this looks.  I was always trying to dig a cotton pad out of the bag and this is a lot nicer.  I just keep the opening facing towards the wall and it looks nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was tired of leaving the cotton rounds in the plastic bag they came in as it looked awful and they were difficult to get out once the supply got low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lid is VERY tight, but since the rounds are dispensed through a side slot, it works perfectly.  This is a nice looking container and heavy enough to stay put when you reach to get a round from it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> It is nice and heavy so it stays in plays as you pull the cotton pad out.  The lid fits snuggly.  It is made of a hard plastic but looks almost glass-like.</li>
    <li> This item is great because it holds a lot of cotton pads and has a hollow strip to make grabbing the pads easier! I am extremely happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> This was a nice container.I would recomend it to everyone.I use it and it works great.Glad I found it. nice</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself and I am really pleased with this purchase.  It is very solid and I love the cut out so I don&#x27;t have to take the lid off to grab a beauty pad.</li>
    <li> This is heavy duty acrylic, it almost looks like glass!  It&#x27;s a very nice and convenient way to store the pads!  Looks great on countertop!</li>
    <li> Delivered in a timely manner.  The front is open to air so I&#x27;m actually not using it yet and it is not heavy enough not to tip over when pulling out cotton pad</li>
    <li> The container did not have a lid in the box, when I opened it. Did not realize it, until it was too late to return it. Unhappy customer. Can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Like another viewer, I got mine in a plain white box and like another viewer the lid did not even fit inside; it was too big!  I immediately notified Amazon online for a refund and they even offered me the option to have UPS pickup from my home; so I didn&#x27;t even have to waste time going to a UPS to drop it off.  The main reason I come back day in and out to Amazon is that they take care of their customers and do not hassle you for a refund when you have a legitimate reason.  I am thinking that I got a fake product, too, based on the other positive reviews and I am disappointed because I really wanted this item.  I&#x27;ll just locate it somewhere else; the genuine item.</li>
    <li> the same me, just like another viewers, I got it in a plain white box, lid did not even fit inside, you need to push it really hard with both hands, very poor Chinese quality, scratches all over the lid! Not Danielle Acrylic for sure!!! Im pissed!</li>
    <li> This product does a great job organizing my cotton beauty puffs conveniently located and organized.  It is also quite attractive and easy to clean container.</li>
    <li> I have a large vanity table for my make up and hair. I have been trying to organize it as everything is just sort of thrown on it. Basically it is a mess. I decided to purchase this as opposed to having the large bag of cotton rounds taking up space. This is a very sturdy piece. The lid needs to be &amp;#34;snapped&amp;#34; on. It does not pop off easily, even when my knock it off the table with the hair dryer. My only complaint is that it is not taller to hold more cotton rounds. It holds about 3/4 of a standard bag. I can squeeze the whole bag into the dispenser; however, the rounds do not come out as easily one by one. It is a great buy, just wish it was taller. Would still recommend this to anyone looking to organize things.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a gift from someone and after reading a few of the reviews about the poor quality of this product I was a bit hesitant. But I went ahead and ordered two of these. Gotta say both were excellent. No scratches/No blemishes on the container lid or body/easy to open lid. And specially like the open cylinder to retrieve the pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I got lucky on these two - but very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This is the only cotton pad dispenser I&#x27;ve ever had, but it&#x27;s very useful. I&#x27;m glad I bought it. Much more classy than just having the cvs bag of cotton pads on your counter. I like that you don&#x27;t have to pull off the lid to take one out.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Now I don&#x27;t have to keep my round swabs in the horrible looking plastic packaging. Even my boyfriend commented on how nice it looks.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved this Acrylic dispenser. Shipping was rapid and arrived a lot sooner than expected and item was just as described. It is a very nice heavy acrylic piece. Extremely happy with this purchase!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my cotton rounds. I use at least one round per day, so having them handy, yet clean, is important. This looks nice sitting on the counter, and keeps the rounds easily accessible and clean.  This was a good choice, and I would choose it again.</li>
    <li> Feels like a quality product, holds the pads great and looks a lot better than a plastic bag in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> Please note, not water proof, the whole front is open, but after I learned to turn it around it worked out great!</li>
    <li> Anything I use daily, I like to have in front of me and nicely stored in something attractive and it matches the acrylic cotton ball/q-tip holder perfectly.</li>
    <li> Very solid, was surprised at that. Looks good and keeps the cotton pads in order. Recommend it.</li>
    <li> How can you go wrong with this product, Women cleansing their face and having a beautiful dispenser to pull their cotton pads from is awesome.</li>
    <li> This case dispenser is a great purchase. I like the fact it will hold a whole bag of the cotton pads</li>
    <li> what a great surprise when I received this cotton pad holder! It&#x27;s good quality heavy acrylic and works wonderfully to keep those cotton rounds in order! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Looks good.  Pads fit well.  Just seems to be more trouble than worth it.  Not  that easy to get out.</li>
    <li> The item I received was not the authentic Danielle cotton pad dispenser as described. It came in an unmarked white box with a \\&quot;made in China\\&quot; sticker on the bottom of box. The dispenser itself was cheaply made and scratched in areas. The opening along the front of the dispenser has tiny little black spots that resembles mold or something. Also the lid doesn&#x27;t fit properly. You have to apply much pressure to get it to close. Needless to say, Amazon was quick to issue a free return label. It&#x27;s just somewhat of a frustrating inconvenience to deal with online returns when all you want is the actual product you ordered. I guess this is an expected downside to online shopping.</li>
    <li> This display looks nice in the bathroom.  It does what it should do.  The lid sticks most of the time so I don&#x27;t lift the lid off with the ball on top, but rather by grabbing the lid from the opening.  Overall, I like it, but I don&#x27;t think it was worth the price I paid.</li>
    <li> After reading some of the reviews, I was a bit concerned I would get some chipped or scatched ones.  But alas, I was one of the lucky ones and both of mine arrived in perfect condition.  I bought one for my young daughter&#x27;s bathroom and she loves it as well.  Easy to refill, fits on the counter perfect, easy to access the cotten rounds - a good value all around.</li>
