      <li>I love her products great for my natural hair and it smells absolutely wonderful.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing on my hair.</li>
      <li>I needed to rub it in my hands for a while to kind of warm it up and make it easier to rub through my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, the smell of the product took some getting used to.</li>

      <li>I use this product on my natural hair and it is the best anti-shrinkage product ever.  </li>
      <li>First of all it smells great.  </li>
      <li>If you have hair like mine, be prepared to spend a good hour or two to get the full effect.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I suffer from a form of scarring alopecia which results in permanent hair loss, healthy hair butter seems to be working to reduce scalp inflammation.  </li>
      <li>My dermatologist urged me to purchase the healthy hair butter in order to help reduce inflammation.  </li>
      <li>The texture is so smooth and creamy!  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve been using Aveda for years now and an overwhelming natural/earthy smell</li>
      <li>it clings to my hair which many products do not do.  </li>
      <li>The jars say Healthy Hair Butter</li>
      <li>Love how it makes my scalp feel</li>
      <li>, that&#x27;s what a healthy product</li>
      <li>I love Carol&#x27;s Daughter hair butter.</li>

      <li>I am returning my order for two jars of Carol&#x27;s Daughter Healthy Hair Butter.  </li>

      <li>/&gt;I am pleased with the seller.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>(I don&#x27;t like the overwhelming smell however,</li>
      <li>and I read that many customers said that this product stops breakage and helps them to retain their growth.</li>
      <li>i love the product.</li>
      <li>if you wear you hair touching or in your face, so use caution.</li>
      <li>men&#x27;s fragrance to me, and the smell is very strong, but it is also very moisturizing and good for the hair, so i give it 4/5 stars.</li>
      <li>It also smells very strong, not the sweet smelling product that most customers claim it is.</li>
      <li>All in all it works great on my natural non chemically treated hair.</li>
      <li>I have natural curly fine hair, and I&#x27;ve experienced balding in the crowning area.</li>
      <li>Just as good or even better for me than natural Shea butter.</li>
      <li>The smell is a bit strong</li>
      <li>And this stuff is strong.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product and ended up get refunded because it isn&#x27;t a the true healthy hair butter</li>
      <li>I love the true product, but this was not it.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect type of cream to lay down edges without a greasy look.  </li>
      <li>: ok, I may have been on a healthy hair hunt when I first posted my rating for this product.</li>
      <li>Took about a week to get here and didn&#x27;t get the free shipping advertised.</li>
      <li>I have been using this stuff for years, it is fantastic.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair feel soft and adds a nice healthy looking sheen.</li>
      <li>The good: Overall it is a good product that made my hair soft and shiny without leaving it greasy.</li>
      <li>The first time I used this product I was in love.  </li>
      <li>I first learned of Healthy Hair Butter from my mom.</li>
      <li>When purchased direct from Sephora, I was very satisfied.</li>
      <li>This product is the BEST thing that has happened to my natural 4b hair since I&#x27;ve done the big cut.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this product and enjoyed the results as far as it making my hair more manageable....</li>
      <li>and so far nothing has compared to it...a phenomenal staple in my product line-up!</li>
      <li>super duper quick with free shipping so definitey by from Macy&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>I really liked how it moisturizes my natural hair.</li>
      <li>I must say Im very impress and satisfied........</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the smell it is very earthy.</li>
      <li>Like i said the product is nice but what was nicer was the action of the company that shipped it, they hand write a thank</li>
      <li>This is NOT the real Carol&#x27;s Daughter Healthy Hair Butter.</li>
      <li>, It is very moisturising and tames my flyaways very well., and makes my hair nice and shiny.</li>
      <li>First off buy this product through Macy&#x27;s on amazon you get it super quick!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure that  I will  buy more products in the future.</li>
      <li>This is also great for smoothing down edges and flyaway hairs.</li>
      <li>For the first few days after using, it&#x27;s very good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;And about the smell, I&#x27;m very allergic to perfumes and strong smells, and although there is a forest-y smell at first, it dissipates quickly (5 minutes)</li>
      <li>This is a honest individual.</li>
      <li>It also leaves a nice (non-greasy) shine on my hair, and overall looks</li>
      <li>Rare behavior during these times.</li>
      <li>They also carry other products that I like with good ph levels.</li>
      <li>Not the right formula</li>
      <li>My hair just loves this... drinks it right up.</li>
      <li>This was my first time using Carol&#x27;s Daughter and I am pleased so far...</li>
      <li>I truly love how this product took my brittle dry hair, to a slight and shiny more  healthy look.</li>
      <li>It is not that special, but as natural hair care products go, I think it is worth the cost.</li>
      <li>I first saw her off of Oprah years ago.</li>
      <li>After purchasing this product the first thing I did was to smell it before trying it.</li>
      <li>Especially if this would be your first time using the healthy hair butter.</li>
      <li>Be aware of this vendor.</li>
      <li>I love this when mixed with moisturizing lotion and applied just once a day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I first learned of Healthy Hair Butter from my mom. I just love this product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a non greasy or heavy hair product. This product allows my hair the freedom to move but keeps the hard to control pieces down. It smells great and leaves a nice shine and I can use it when my hair is wet and dry. This is just what I have been looking for in a black hair care product.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this product has so many healthy ingredients.  For the first few days after using, it&#x27;s very good. (I don&#x27;t like the overwhelming smell however, because I have a lot of allergies to fragrances).After a few days there tends to be a waxy build-up on my hair. I wash my hair every 5-7 days and it gets limp, unresponsive, and dry-looking with just this product.  I have type 4b hair. I may have to use this just a couple of days and then switch to another product between washes.</li>
    <li> I bought this and the healthy hair butter for my own hair, but ended up selling it to my mom for her to use on my nephews&#x27; hair. It smells like a (very nice) men&#x27;s fragrance to me, and the smell is very strong, but it is also very moisturizing and good for the hair, so i give it 4/5 stars.</li>
    <li> I was originally a fan of Asha&#x27;s, but the service is terrible.  So I decided to try CD HHB and I&#x27;m totally hooked!  I have used over half the jar already and that&#x27;s saying a lot for a product junkie like me.  It totally moisurizes and improves the condition of the hair.  Macy ships out super duper quick with free shipping so definitey by from Macy&#x27;s.  This cream is definitely a staple in my hair care regimen.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and enjoyed the results as far as it making my hair more manageable....but I have to stop using it, after Iam finished the jar(cant afford to waste money). Iam into healthy natural black hair...my hair is 4a...thick and curly....this product is like giving my natural curls a perm. The PH in this product is 8.0....that&#x27;s crazy. I dont know what secret ingredients they are putting in the healthy hair butter but its not good for your hair. Please carol..fix this so that the ph level is between 4-5.0, that&#x27;s what a healthy product ph level should be at. The hair milk is a little better for the hair. It&#x27;s level is at 6.0. I want to use Carol&#x27;s products but I dont want to perm my curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: ok, I may have been on a healthy hair hunt when I first posted my rating for this product. I was only rating the ph level. Now that I am not a ph junky I must say this product isn&#x27;t that bad. I gave it another try and it does moisturize my hair and gives it shine. So the product does what it says it will do. They also carry other products that I like with good ph levels. Nevertheless, I am learning that ph levels are not a deal breaker for me and my natural hair is still nice, thick, curly and growing just fine.</li>
    <li> I always thought this was too heavy for my hair, it is very dense and thick yet very creamy. My stylist told me this is great for the scalp, especially since I often get dry flakes in the wintertime. I place just a small amount in the areas that itch and the Pachouli in the hair butter soothes it. The smell is a bit strong but I&#x27;ve been using Aveda for years now and an overwhelming natural/earthy smell doesn&#x27;t bother me much. This is also great for smoothing down edges and flyaway hairs. Or take a tiny bit and rub your hands together, apply to ends for added moisture.</li>
    <li> I have been natural for 2 years now and I know what&#x27;s what when it comes to natural hair care products.  When I say that I&#x27;ve tried it all, I have.  This product is the BEST thing that has happened to my natural 4b hair since I&#x27;ve done the big cut.  You can feel how much is penetrates the hair shaft and deeply moisturizes and brings to life dry brittle ends.  I love this product.  The down side is probably the way it smells; it&#x27;s VERY strong to me personally but the good completely outweighs the bad! Buy this product.</li>
    <li> After purchasing this product the first thing I did was to smell it before trying it. And this stuff is strong. It took me awhile before I had the courage to try it. I also allowed it to sit out with the top off in hopes the scent would die down. And it did. When using this product I ignored the directions of using it sparingly. Now I know why because the cream will not dry well when you use too much. I ended up having to rub some of it our before leaving the house. All in all it works great on my natural non chemically treated hair. It create shine and moisture as well as makes my hair soft and defines my coils. I recommend this product for those looking for a product for natural hair because it is a thick cream that may way down straight and chemically treated hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this healthy hair butter in a 4oz jar. I really liked how it moisturizes my natural hair. I then ordered a second jar this time the 8oz. So I guess that speaks for itself. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> First off buy this product through Macy&#x27;s on amazon you get it super quick! The hair butter has a very distinct smell it does smell like pine a bit but after a well the scent sets in and smells good! I reviewed a lot of customer reviews before I bought this specific product. I&#x27;ve used Carols Daughter in the past when my hair was relaxed and it worked wonders I have thick hair and it was awesome! I recently went natural and did the big cut and I needed to get my hands on some CD products to cater to my hair texture and I reviewed this product and it great for moisture its not sticky at all its very lightweight and it makes your hair look good I suggest that anybody should try it and the best part is that you don&#x27;t even need that much product probably like a dime or nickel size! I recommend this to anybody that has natural hair or is in the transition from relaxed to natural hair!</li>
    <li> I just received this product yesterday, tried it and HATED it. If I had my way, I wouldn&#x27;t give it any stars at all. I bought this product thinking that it would do what many customers claimed that it would do. I am an African American and with natural thick, coarse hair and I read that many customers said that this product stops breakage and helps them to retain their growth. Well, this product did not own up to doing what it said that it would do for this problem. Instead, it made my hair break off worst than it EVER did before. There&#x27;s no way that someone like me can grow their hair out with a product that is as BAD as this one is. It also smells very strong, not the sweet smelling product that most customers claim it is. As for this product being healthy, there are some natural ingredients in it, but the rest are chemical based products and that&#x27;s probably why my hair broke off so bad. Carol&#x27;s daughter products are way to expensive to have products that are this bad and full of chemicals in it. I should have listened to some of the customers on other sites that said this product was no good. I thought maybe they could be wrong, they were so right on about this product. I just didn&#x27;t listen. If you want to grow longer hair, don&#x27;t buy this product. All I have to say is, BUYER BE WARE!!!</li>
    <li> I used this hair butter on my daughter&#x27;s coarse hair and it really softened her hair, it was more manageable. So i&#x27;m very pleased with this products. I love the smell, most people probably won&#x27;t because its different and a little strong but i&#x27;m used to herby smell, the only thing was that.. maybe because it&#x27;s so creamy and thick that it makes the hair look dry even though its not, so i just add a little coconut oil to her hair along with this product, and that solved it. Like i said the product is nice but what was nicer was the action of the company that shipped it, they hand write a thank you note and had a little perfume sampler, that really touched my heart, so i would definately buy from them. Little things like that makes a difference.</li>
    <li> The jars say Healthy Hair Butter but that was not what I received. The contents were a totally different color, texture, and fragrance than what is pictured. I have used this product in the past. Rather than a white cream, it was yellow and extremely thick like a hair pomade (i.e. Murrays or Dax). I love the true product, but this was not it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to buy products from Carol&#x27;s daughter since  I first saw her off of Oprah years ago. I have natural curly fine hair, and I&#x27;ve experienced balding in the crowning area. I gave this a five because I like what the owner stands for. However it&#x27;s too soon to know what the complete results will be. I&#x27;m sure that  I will  buy more products in the future.</li>
    <li> Love how it makes my scalp feel</li>
    <li> it has a funny smell but It does work.  I will not purchase again because CD products are expensive and there are other products out there that do the same thing for less.</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for 2 yrs  and I am very pleased with the results, my hair feel wonderful and look very healthy.</li>
    <li> Took about a week to get here and didn&#x27;t get the free shipping advertised. Hands down I love this product. One of the only butter that works well on my hair. Just as good or even better for me than natural Shea butter.</li>
    <li> Had it for a few months, just opened it and found it totally rancid.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is so and the color yellowed. Seperated oil on top.&lt;br /&gt;stupid me tried putting it on the hair. It was sticky and  filmy at the same time. Yuck!&lt;br /&gt;I wondered whether it arrived rancid or went bad during the few months. It sucks either way. I need a hair product to stay stable for a year or two. I alternate between a few products, don&#x27;t use them up within few months.&lt;br /&gt;I came to read reviews  and quite a bit of reviewers here have had the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;Some messed up folks are selling old rancid stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it from \\&quot;Lots a Beauty Bargains\\&quot;. Be aware of this vendor.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and ended up get refunded because it isn&#x27;t a the true healthy hair butter (I have purchased it before from another seller). I just want anyone who is thinking of purchasing from this seller be careful because it is a mixture not a original product. Especially if this would be your first time using the healthy hair butter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, the smell of the product took some getting used to.It is very distinctive of the patchouli and at first I thought I reeked of incense. But it worked wonders on my locked hair. The locks are very shiny and soft with the use of very little product. This was my first time using Carol&#x27;s Daughter and I am pleased so far...</li>
    <li> I love Carol&#x27;s Daughter hair butter. There&#x27;s NO WHERE else you can find Carol&#x27;s Daughters product except Amazon. I have already recommended this ii some people. Great product and works like a charm!</li>
    <li> This is a really good product.  It is not that special, but as natural hair care products go, I think it is worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I truly love how this product took my brittle dry hair, to a slight and shiny more  healthy look. being this is my first time using carols daughter I must say Im very impress and satisfied........thanks carols daughter for bringing this product out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for years, it is fantastic. When I use it I always get compliments on my hair. It makes my hair feel soft and adds a nice healthy looking sheen. It is kind of heavy so if you have a relaxer a little goes a long way. If you use too much it weighs your hair down, not sure if it has the same weighing effect on natural hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.  My dermatologist urged me to purchase the healthy hair butter in order to help reduce inflammation.  I suffer from a form of scarring alopecia which results in permanent hair loss, healthy hair butter seems to be working to reduce scalp inflammation.  I hope the product continues to work for me.  I apply the product every other day just before bed time and the scent is not intense the next day.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Smells good ... Not too oily</li>
    <li> Carol&#x27;s Daughter used to sell better quality products. I&#x27;ve purchased her products for at least 6 years. The ingredients have changed over the years and not in a good way. The products are the same price, if not more, but the quality has diminished. It no longer gives my hair the moisture and softness it used too! I am not a fan anymore. It forced me to make my own hair care products for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this product I was in love.  First of all it smells great.  Second it clings to my hair which many products do not do.  I have very thick hair and have difficulty managing flyaways.  Healthy Hair Butter tames the flyways and makes my hair look healthy!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Carol&#x27;s Daughter!</li>
    <li> For natural hair&lt;br /&gt;Carol&#x27;s Daughter Healthy Hair Butter is very good.  I try a lot of products I like it but, I do not love it.  It seem a little greasy to me.</li>
    <li> Super greasy and didn&#x27;t absorb into my hair, even though I used a tiny amount. Didn&#x27;t like it so it was returned.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my natural hair and it is the best anti-shrinkage product ever.  It is too heavy to use with a flat iron.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this particular product did not make the cut. Appeared old/expired, pasty, more yellow than accustomed, and the odor was not pleasant. I am in the process of returning. When purchased direct from Sephora, I was very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I always use this product. my only issue is that the smell is strong which is why I don&#x27;t like many products for black women&#x27;s hair. but it does condition and soften my hair and the feeling lasts for days after washing it. it is greasy but you have to use just a little on the scalp. it&#x27;s also good for braids and twists.</li>
    <li> My hair just loves this... drinks it right up. New Staple hair product!! Only dislike is the smell..its a lil overbearing. Like wood dipped in a fragrant perfume . Arrived promptly</li>
    <li> The good: Overall it is a good product that made my hair soft and shiny without leaving it greasy. I had never used a product that left my hair in such a way without feeling like I had to wash it again at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;The gripes: I thought this product would be creamier than it was. it&#x27;s really thick and quite sticky. I needed to rub it in my hands for a while to kind of warm it up and make it easier to rub through my hair. I have thick curly hair that tends to frizz and dry up at the ends. Rubbing it in was difficult and it pulled my hair. It was just much more time consuming than I would have liked because I had to work it slowly and carefully to avoid pulling my hair out or breaking it. I had to comb it through and use a blow dryer to keep the cream from sticking and make it easier to work through. If you have hair like mine, be prepared to spend a good hour or two to get the full effect.</li>
    <li> I LOVED THE HAIR BUTTER FROM CAROLS DAUGHTER. AT FIRST I TRIED ON DRY HAIR, AND IT LEFT MY HAIR VERY GREASY. SO, UI TRIED AFTER I WASHED MY HAIR. I COMBED IT THREW LEFT IT OVERNIGHT, AND WHEN I WOKED UP I HAD SOFT CURLS AND VERY SHINY.</li>
    <li> Not the right formula it&#x27;s old and I like the newer formula better totally not happy. I wished for the reg formula didn&#x27;t know I was getting an old one</li>
    <li> This is NOT the real Carol&#x27;s Daughter Healthy Hair Butter. What I received in the mail was a dark yellow, oily mixture in a Carol&#x27;s Daughter jar. I am refunding this product immediately.</li>
    <li> Has worked wonders on my daughters thin, dry edges.  I love this when mixed with moisturizing lotion and applied just once a day.</li>
    <li> This product was awful. Had a very unpleasant smell. Had to wash my hair to get the smell out. The cream was like paste and had a darker color in the bottom, like it was old. I&#x27;m not returning because it would not be cost effective That would be a  $9.00 s/h fee for this 1 product- to much money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the seller. I was refunded the entire cost s/h and all. That says a lot about the character of the seller who did stand behind their product. Rare behavior during these times. I will buy from this person again. You don&#x27;t often find this kind of integrity in selling. This is a honest individual.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an African-American natural with 4a/4b hair. Like many of the other reviewers, I agree that this product is thick and the smell can be overwhelming. However, I use it as a sealant ONLY and so far nothing has compared to it...a phenomenal staple in my product line-up! I do not recommend this product as a daily hairdress or for any other uses other than sealing and maybe dry spots around edges or temple.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s so sticky that it remains even after you wash your hands with soap.&lt;br /&gt;I have black straight hair permed at the end. After I use it, the hair becomes stick as well...not good at all...</li>
    <li> The product is more like cold butter than room temperature butter which makes application a challege.  The smell isn&#x27;t as bad as I was expecting but not a preferred smell.  Will continue to use the product until my jar is finished and doubt that I would purchase this one again.  I will try another CB product before moving to another company.</li>
    <li> Healthy Hair Butter is one hair product I will purchase as long as it&#x27;s around.  This is the perfect type of cream to lay down edges without a greasy look.  Perfect for braid outs and pony tails.  The texture is so smooth and creamy!  It&#x27;s definitely NOT thick or sticky.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a \\&quot;life-changing\\&quot; product, but it&#x27;s pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, mixed-race, relaxed hair, and my ends are always breaking off badly. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week now, and it definitely has been keeping my ends moisturized and I no longer look desperate for a trim. It also leaves a nice (non-greasy) shine on my hair, and overall looks healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use about a nickel-sized dollop everyday on my hair &amp; focusing on my ends, and I&#x27;m pretty happy thus far. Much better than my wasted years using Organic Root Stimulator!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And about the smell, I&#x27;m very allergic to perfumes and strong smells, and although there is a forest-y smell at first, it dissipates quickly (5 minutes) and I never have any breathing issues come up. Unless you&#x27;re super-sensitive to smells, you&#x27;ll likely be fine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing on my hair. A little goes a LONG way. I am Caucasian (just sayin) and I have 2c - 3a hair ( I believe ) its medium texture. I absolutely love the smell it is very earthy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I wanted to expand my use of the brand.  Although it is a nice product and does nicely on my hair; I am not to fond of the smell.  It sort of has a rancid order to it, which does go away.  It has a lot of natural oils, so that just might be what is causing it.  I am not certain whether I would purchase it again --not because of the smell-- but because I think it is too similar to products I have purchased at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.</li>
    <li> I am returning my order for two jars of Carol&#x27;s Daughter Healthy Hair Butter.  The product is usually an off-white color and a creamy consistency.  The product that arrived to day was yellow, hard, and separated into layers.</li>
    <li> This stuff smelled like vomit...went on in clumps whether my hair was wet or dry...hard to wash out due to the ingredient beeswax so I had to go around smelling like vomit for a couple weeks :(</li>
    <li> I do love this product but the one i resently received was no good. I think it was from a very old batch or something. Should have order from the actually site because when i got the product i noticed it had the old label on it ( they changed the label design), and the product had some seperation and didnt feel at all the same as the others i&#x27;d purchased. I had to try and mix it myself which was very messy and it didnt seem to get it back to the orginally feel. Other then the fact that this one was no good i love the product. I stopped using all the gels and moouses, hairsprays and just use this and Wen styling product, It is very moisturising and tames my flyaways very well., and makes my hair nice and shiny. The smell isnt too great i must admit and If you have acne prone skin (i unfortunatly do) it can cause you to breakout if you wear you hair touching or in your face, so use caution.</li>
    <li> I love her products great for my natural hair and it smells absolutely wonderful. I will continue to purchase this product</li>
    <li> I used Carol&#x27;s Daughter in the pass.  It was my favorite&lt;br /&gt;hair grease.  It appears to be a slight different.&lt;br /&gt;than the previous batches I&#x27;ve use.  I compared the&lt;br /&gt;ingredients to the batch I&#x27;m currently using and there&#x27;s a&lt;br /&gt;variation in the essential oils.  It tends to have&lt;br /&gt;a sticky consistency.  I still prefer it over&lt;br /&gt;the other oils I use such as Nature&#x27;s Blessing&lt;br /&gt;and Organic Tea-Tree Gro.</li>
