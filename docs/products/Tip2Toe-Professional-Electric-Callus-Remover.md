<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this at the recommendation of my son and find it handy to have.  It is painless to use this little gadget.</li>
    <li> This is the best callus remover I&#x27;ve had yet.  Start with the finer disk until you have learned how to use it.  This is a very powerful unit.  I&#x27;ve found that if I tap the area to be smoothed it doesn&#x27;t overdo it or &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34;.  I can repeatedly tap the same area until I achieve the desired smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that calluses develop for a reason.  They protect tender areas by growing thicker skin.....which means that as you remove the calluses, you can find your feet to walk over pebbles, hot sand  etc.</li>
    <li> It works.  It is stronger than the ones that uses batteries.  No regrets in getting this item.  It is a keeper.  Ps...you must not watch tv while using this device.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and agree with them for the most part. I received my callus remover quickly, and ordered extra disks. As for this electric tool: it is VERY powerful, and one needs to use it carefully. Just a few seconds and I smelled burning &#x27;skin.&#x27; It is very easy to get burned if you are not careful. The coarse disks are the best, but, they might wear out after only one use. The problem for me however, was that I have tiny &#x27;dots&#x27; of calluses from pressure points and these were what I was after. The flat disk cannot &#x27;go there&#x27; as all skin is equally worn down. In the end, I went back to a manual foot filer. I think a professional pedicurist would be able to use this better.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing.  I&#x27;ve had cracked heels for 15 years, so bad sometimes the cracks were like deep painful knife cuts.  I tried every cream and buffer and professional pedicure.  Some would work for a few weeks, but nothing ever got through the layers of tough skin.  Then, for less than the cost of a pedicure, I bought this callus remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe the reviews that say you need to be careful.  This is a powerful unit and, even on the low setting, can burn if you leave it on one spot for more than a second or two.  Just take your time and apply it lightly to the rough areas.  I used it every other day for 2 weeks and now only need it once a week.  I&#x27;m still on the first disk, so the supply that came in the package will last me a few years.</li>
    <li> I have not yet tried the equipment, but right out of the box there is a lack of instructions and no information provided for replacement disks.  If this is truly intended for professional use, wouldn&#x27;t they expect to sell lots of replacement disks so the professional may use on their clients?  No replacement disks are sold on Amazon either.  I am awaiting a response from the seller regarding the replacement disk.  If none is available, I&#x27;m sending this one back.  The equipment appears to be powerful enough for the intended use, but the surface of the disks are small.</li>
    <li> Used once - lowest speed and it does generate some heat so keep it moving and don&#x27;t press on it!!  But it tickled my feet so bad I had a very hard time sitting still long enough to smooth out those heels!  It has a heavy duty electric cord and it&#x27;s long - I could measure it but I&#x27;d say it was 6 to 10 feet long.  Oh!  And the plug also has one of those reset buttons in case of an electrical situation.  Just take it easy until you get familiar with it and get ready for some giggling.  I just never realized my feet were so ticklish.</li>
    <li> Brought this item for my Husband who has like Dragon like feet.  I have brought every creme, lotion, rock, callous remover battery and electric cord there is out there.  Some of the Callus Battery Operated machines would stop as soon we put it on his foot.  But this machine was the most professional strength  Callous Remover there is.  After 25 mins on high with the Coarse Disks his feet looked like normal feet again.  Best thing ever for people who have SUPER HARD THICK CALLOUS feet.  Yes it will burn you if you have soft skin or just a small callous.  This is no joke meant for people who feet need serious help.</li>
    <li> Well I got mine today and used on my awful cracked feet, it works very well but it will take practice...  This products delivers as described, but I agree with the others that it can burn your skin if you don&#x27;t keep it moving.  Excellent delivery and tracking.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product. Just be careful or you&#x27;ll set you feet on fire.</li>
    <li> I bought this as part of a pedi regimen because I thought it would be quicker and more effective than a foot scaper or using pumice or the like.  Well, I guess you have to have elephant hide rather than skin because even the lightest touch with the smoothest head and the lowest setting gets to a burn sensation incredibly quickly.  A most unpleasant tool.  It&#x27;s also heavier than I had expected and awkward to hold.  Even with the stated weight, I think it&#x27;s the lack of ergonomic design that&#x27;s the problem. The angle of the handle relative to its body, which is where the weight is, makes it top-heavy and so difficult to hold during operation without running into problems with the adjustment knob and/or the power switch. Because it requires such dexterity in application to avoid a burn, it&#x27;s very awkward to use and fairly ineffective.  It may work better as a wood sander than anything contacting a person, but I&#x27;ve already got one of those...In retrospect, I wish I&#x27;d sent it back.</li>
    <li> Way to powerful. We might try it on some wood projects.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical too.  So glad I purchased! I read previous reviews and was VERY careful first time.  I soaked my feet and used very light taps with machine. Took calluses right off and wasn&#x27;t hot at all.  I do see how u can burn thru ur skin if you use too much pressure and stay in one spot too long. Must keep moving it.  I took my time but after doing one foot I felt like a pro.  After using the fine tip my feet felt silky soft and they put holes in my socks b4 from such bad calluses.  Love this product. Only reason I gave 4 stars is bc it is pretty loud but not really a concern for me.  Do not hesitate to buy this... Just be smart and careful when you do it for first time.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for something that removes my calluses for years and years.  This is quick and efficient.  I won&#x27;t ever need to but anything else!</li>
    <li> The motor on this does have a variable speed adjustment, however, even at the lowest speed it goes like a bat out of...  Well, anyway, I discovered that you have to barely tap your foot with the disk and move to the next spot.  I thought I&#x27;d almost gone to the bone on my big toe!  So, it does work, and the disks are different grades, but if you order extra disks at the same time as the device I&#x27;d just stick with the fine grade, no matter how calloused your feet are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it doesn&#x27;t have directions for removing and installing the disks.  You have to line up protrusions on the disk support with teensy grooves inside the disk.  The disk is like a plastic bottle cap, not just the sanding section.  Once lined up, push down fairly hard to seat the disk.  To remove the disk go get somebody strong and have them pull it off.  I mean Schwarzengger strong, that cap is on there but good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exhaust port at the back really blows hard, it was surprising the first time I turned it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very bad arthritis in my hands, but I was able to use this without too much trouble, I just had to fiddle until I got a good grip on it.  I honestly cannot remove the disks once attached, but my hands are very weak and gripping anything tightly hurts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best callous remover I&#x27;ve used, I do wish the motor speed could be turned down a little lower, and it really would be easy to hurt yourself if you don&#x27;t pay attention.  Then again, that burning feeling should clue you in.</li>
    <li> Excellent, but absolutely zero instructions included which led to a number of cuts before I turned to the reviews to see how to use it.</li>
    <li> Horrible experience .got this delivered  on sunday  but opened  package and the  head of the  machine was broken not happy at all!!!! I sent  it back  Monday morning.</li>
    <li> absolutely love it!!! I have had problems all my life with thick callouses that had deep cracks. It was very painful. With just 3 uses of the Tip2Toe the callouses and cracks are gone! My feet are soft and smooth! Thank you Tip2Toe</li>
    <li> This Tip2Toe callus remover is the best thing I could have ever purchased. It removed my foot calluses in about 2 minutes. It literally took hours with other removers I bought. This is a miracle. It repaired some deep heel cracks as well in just minutes. It softens your skin and keeps it healthy. Great for people with diabetes as well, to keep their feet healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Finaly something that works!!!</li>
    <li> This is a dangerous product !! I ordered one and when I tried to use it , it immediately overheated to the point where it almost burned my foot. I called Amazon and returned it.</li>
    <li> head a bit small, and if you hold to lone in one spot will burn you</li>
    <li> Very powerful as it states. Use with caution meaning very little pressure and short intervals on the calluses or you will burn the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had electrical callus removers before, but this one is whoa!.  The only potential problem is on the lowest setting if the sander is left on your skin....it will burn your skin it is so fast.  My heels were horrible.  After about a minute per heel....slick smooth.  Very nice....just be careful.</li>
    <li> I received  the Tip to Toe Callus remover and it was too noisy&lt;br /&gt;so i was disappointed  extremely&lt;br /&gt;so have  returned  it</li>
    <li> I have the worse calluses and dry skin this made my feet so smooth</li>
    <li> I love it for my dry heels.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t believe this would work for my hard callused feet.  After putting it to work on my feet, I was amazed at how fast it worked and it was so easy!  No more painful efforts of using a Ped Egg or pumice stones that never worked after 15 minutes of grinding.</li>
    <li> Excellent unit high quality good price.</li>
    <li> So I purchased this a week ago and couldn&#x27;t wait to get it in the mail. I used it that very same day and I was so impressed with the results. So smooth and clean, I would say it took about 5 minutes per foot. Trust me when I tell you I&#x27;m not a frequent pedicure recipient, which left much build up. My pumice stones did a lot of work, but not like this. I was able to get rid of those stubborn callouses and build up in one shot. Amazing! I am so impressed and would highly recommend it, plus i will save money in the long run for upkeep. Enjoy.</li>
    <li> love it, time and money savings, not need to go to the salon and spend money. Worth the money, need to be careful when using though</li>
    <li> Great produce. Wish it had a slower speed. Go light with your touch</li>
    <li> horrible - i returned. anyone who can use this must have feet of leather</li>
    <li> Great I love it , I save my time and my feet look really clean and soft&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much and the price is reasonal</li>
    <li> I really had not expected this to work that well, since I have tried so many others and ended up throwing them out or giving them away. I figured it didn&#x27;t cost that much and it was worth a try. I can&#x27;t believe what a great product this is. You can control the amount of pressure that you use. After 30 seconds the learning curve is over. I highly recommend this product. It is the best. It takes 5 minutes and your feet feel like new.</li>
    <li> My original thought after I used this was to come here and berate all the people who gave it a one star review because they thought it was too powerful. But then I realized that the one star reviews are the reason I decided to give it a try. I get big, thick, tough calluses on my feet that are very painful. I&#x27;ve tried multiple types of buffers and other means to remove them and smooth them down, all to varying degrees of success. I figured there had to be something out there that could handle the job better and I hoped this was it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I got this, I put the rougher of the two discs on, started off on low to test it out, and within a few seconds I had it cranked all the way up as high as it could go and was buffing away. It made short work of my calluses. It sanded them right down to a smooth finish. Yes, if you go too far, it will burn, but that&#x27;s the sign that you&#x27;ve gotten down to skin, which is where you want to be. That&#x27;s happened with any buffer that I&#x27;ve used, but it gets there much quicker with this one. It just takes a little bit of practice to get the feel for it and know when to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the types of calluses that I have and you have had a difficult time trying to remove them, then this is the product for you. It does exactly what it was designed for, which is to remove and smooth out tough calluses. If you find that it&#x27;s too powerful, then you don&#x27;t have those types of calluses and you have the wrong tool for the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Return it and find the right one for you. But don&#x27;t give this one a one star review because it wasn&#x27;t it. It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. So don&#x27;t be so &amp;#34;callous&amp;#34; with your reviews (see what I did there).</li>
    <li> So appreciate previous reviewers&#x27; comments, as this little device does its duty in a snap. Best to take it slow and easy with multiple passes, cooling as you go.  Just love this product, which beats the battery-operated devices by a long shot. Received product quickly and in perfect condition.  I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> but you might as well just use a dremel.  It is as powerful as some rotary tools out there and if you are not careful you will take your toe off.  I let mine run wild a bit and sliced my foot open.  Be careful if you are diabetic and get this thing.  It is very powerful and you just need to be careful with it and it will smooth out the toughest feet.</li>
    <li> I want to return the first one that didn&#x27;t work and thanks for the second one that works,&lt;br /&gt;Can I get a return label for the box?</li>
    <li> so much better than battery operated</li>
    <li> It did not work for me, but it worked great on my husband&#x27;s feet</li>
    <li> It spins so fast on the lowest setting you could probably remove paint off the walls. it can burn too. I would not recommend wasting your money.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work good for me at all.</li>
    <li> A lot of negative postings about this product. My husband has some serious calluses on his feet and nothing, short of a cheese grater (used at a salon) worked. This product is powerful, but you just need to be careful with it. Don&#x27;t let someone else do it for you so you can feel what you are doing. This product worked very well and the calluses haven&#x27;t grown back yet, so that&#x27;s a bonus. Make sure to use with caution, but if you are smart about it and take your time, it is an amazing product for those who need this heavy duty machine to get rid of calluses.</li>
    <li> I was really looking foward to receiving this item, since I would love to have smooth soft skin on my feet.  When it arrived tonight, I found the warning reviews were not exaggerating.  Even at the slowest speed this device is hard to control and will burn your skin.  I am returning this item as soon as possible. It really doesn&#x27;t deserve one star, but I was unsure how to skip that part of the review.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very easy to burn the bejesus out of your calluses.  Calli? Whatever, be careful. Be gentle with yourself.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and it does exactly like she needed. She gets good use out of it.</li>
    <li> A machine to be respected, but with care does a superb job.  Control and a light touch is key.  Get too aggressive and either the grinder ricochets to a tender spot or the area being ground gets hot.  The shape doesn&#x27;t seem right, but I cannot think of a better one.</li>
    <li> Years of cutting, shaving, and exfoliating with files that are too abrasive, made my feet rougher and rougher. The rough areas started to harden and crack with age and it was ugly and painful. I thought I ruined my feet forever with my at home pedicure techniques. Late one night I found this and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just one use, my feet are like new feet! I can&#x27; believe how effective and smooth they are and how easily and quickly I was able to acheive such amazing results. This is a wonderful machine. I will purchase more and give to everyone as gifts. You cannot live without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bit of warning. This is a professinal grade machine. And as with all professional grade tools, it doesn&#x27;t come with step by step instuctions as it assumes you are a licensed professional who know what you are doing. So here is my advice to you. Use the fine grit first even if you are eager to try the rough grit disks. And put it on it&#x27;s lowest setting. Don&#x27;t worry, there is not a big difference between the lowest and highest setting. Then just gently hold it to the rough parts you are trying to smooth out. Often times the rotating wheel will catch on the skin and cause it to &amp;#34;hop&amp;#34;. I think it&#x27;s normal and I found the &#x27;hopping&amp;#34; to be useful. First, it keeps a novice from grinding away too much skin too quickly without knowing when to stop. Second it keeps a novice from burning himself. The rotating disk creates a lot of friction which causes a lot of heat. Your skin can easily get too hot. Definitely try it on yourself and get good with using the tool before you try it on someone else. Because you can feel what you are doing to yourself. Otherwise, you an easily burn another person if you are not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hightly recommend and I am looking forward to summer/sandal season now. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> The device is very powerful and you ahev to be careful when applying it to your foot (it may cause a burn)</li>
    <li> Tried many things before, but nothing as great as this item. My feet calluses have been very bad for as long as I can remember. This worked awesome. Very powerful, easy to use. Had on the lowest setting only. Took my calluses totally away in one treatment. Now I only need to moisturize. It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks now and dryness only remains but no deep cracks, hardness, broken skin, or pain. I&#x27;m not embarrassed to show my feet and wear my sandals or go barefoot.</li>
    <li> Works fantastically.  On low speed only - you need to be careful when using it that you don&#x27;t take off too much skin!!  I love this product - better than any other I&#x27;ve used before and well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I love this thing.....works great and got rid of my cracked heels in two sessions!  A little pricey; but, considering what it would have cost at a salon for several pedicures to rid myself of my ugly heels, this was worth the price.  Hope it lasts a long time; but if it should break, I&#x27;d buy again.....best thing on the market for cracked heels! The most powerful, too!</li>
    <li> this is my far the best tool for the job, with the adjustable speed setting and the removable sanding cup&#x27;s different grit size for what ever the need.</li>
    <li> This product states that it &amp;#34;gently&amp;#34; removes calluses....there is nothing gentle about it!  It&#x27;s like a power sander!  It is loud, and gets very hot after only a minute of use, so I have to use it in small increments.  During my last use, the sander disc went flying off into the next room, although I&#x27;m sure it was securely placed.  I want to return it, but missed the return window by one day.  (It was a Christmas present, and didn&#x27;t use it enough times--due to overheating--to make this decision in time.)  It does, however, effectively remove calluses even with the fine-grit disc, so if you&#x27;ve got tough calluses, it will do the job.  But it might take off a toe in the process!</li>
    <li> Wow, this did the job in no time!  Living in San Diego, I am either barefoot or in sandals and therefore want my feet to look pretty at all times.  This machine made my heels soft in seconds!  Be careful ..... keep it moving over your skin or it will burn you and remember to moisturize afterwards.  I highly recommend this product and am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Not for the faint of heart (is that how the saying goes?)  Very powerful tool.  You get the feel for it the immediately following  first time you burn your foot.  No pain no gain!  Honestly it works really good.  I recommend</li>
    <li> Works a hundred times faster that a file. Just remember not to press very hard, let the tool do the work.</li>
    <li> Its ok. Nothing great. It heats up quickly so you can keep it on one area very long.  Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> As the title says, this machine does not remove callus&#x27;s. It couldn&#x27;t even remove normal dead skin much less a callus. The tool worked except that if you press down too hard the motor slows and the rotating disc slows down quite a lot. I understand this is probably to help prevent injury but it makes things a lot slower and annoying. I tried using a higher speed and the disc did get a little hotter so I imagine if you&#x27;re not careful you could get burned, it just goes too fast (which doesn&#x27;t make a difference in removing dead skin btw because I tried the lowest speed and a very high speed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only have 1 callus and it&#x27;s not a bad one but then the skin on the rest of my feet just needs to be filed down a little bit and I give myself pedicures all the time, I usually use tweezerman files and I can see if it&#x27;s working because when you file off dead skin it turns into a white powder sort of. Using this product, hardly any dead skin was taken off at all, just a tiny bit. It wasn&#x27;t pretty much polishing the skin instead of removing the build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already contacted amazon to return this item...it is NOT worth 50 bucks. In my experience it doesn&#x27;t work at all &amp; I would not recommend buying it. I guess I will stick with regular filling and elbow grease.</li>
    <li> PRO:&lt;br /&gt;- fast work sanding down the dead skin&lt;br /&gt;- very easy to replace the sandpaper w/ standard sandpaper.  Just peel off the sanding pad &amp; glue on inexpensive sandpaper from your local DIY stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:&lt;br /&gt;- it requires a steady hand &amp; pressure.  If you press down a bit too hard, the motor would quickly slow down so much that it&#x27;s no longer effective.  If you compensate by increasing the speed, then it could burn your skin very quickly.  After some testing, I finally settled on a medium-high speed setting &amp; worked it w/ a quick bouncing motion to (1) keep the motor from slowing down, (2) hit the thick skin area to sand it down &amp; then quickly move off to avoid heat build up.&lt;br /&gt;- a bit difficult to control, especially if you are using it on your own hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING how it has transformed that nastiest feet into smooth and soft heels. It is pretty loud but for the short period of time you use it, it&#x27;s no big deal (sounds like a hair drier). Just don&#x27;t leave it on one spot too long because it will get HOT in an instant. Does a wonderful job grinding those gross layers of dead skin down.</li>
    <li> This is no joke. Works fast, strong and efficient. Don&#x27;t be scared. Just go slow and do a little at a time and you won&#x27;t have to worry about the strength. Take it slow. Works great. Love it. Really loud though so tell your family what you are doing! LOL.</li>
    <li> This is so much better than any callus remover I&#x27;ve used before because it has so much power!!!</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this Electric Callus Remover to anyone whose feet are really, really rough.  Nothing else would work on my husband&#x27;s feet; he has very callused heals and all over rough feet.  This is the ONLY Callus Remover that has even begun to remove the dead skin; we LOVE this and will never use anything else.  It is well worth the little extra money that it costs; so glad we ordered it...Happy Customer!!  Thank you so much for inventing something that actually works!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Tip2Toe for my husband, because he has calluses on both feet.  He tried it when it came and said it works like a dream.  The only think he said was to be careful and not to put too much pressure while your trying to eliminate the callus, because you can burn yourself.</li>
    <li> This electric callus remover is superb! There are some products that I have found do not last because they are meant for only light use. Although, if you do want to give yourself a pedicure, or maybe maintain soft feet in between pedicures, I highly recommend this product. It is indeed sturdy, and well-built. The disks are rough enough to get the calluses off the feet. The seller, Wet Brush, delivered it quickly as well!</li>
    <li> This thing does not mess around. I used it on its lowest setting and it was intense. My feet were pretty bad and I was sick of manually scraping them, so this is exactly what I needed. Made my feet nice and smooth!</li>
    <li> WOW! Amazing, doesn&#x27;t get better than this.  Very, very powerful, must use carefully.</li>
    <li> spins too fast can burn the skin.</li>
    <li> This works but it could be better. The disc is small and can burn your skin. The rotation could be built like the Micro Pedi which would work better on the foot.</li>
    <li> I have used the callus remover 3 times since it arrived. It&#x27;s probably better for a professional to use on a client than to use on yourself, but it does work to remove calluses very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sanding disc spins extremely fast and can burn your skin if you make contact too long in one spot. I am happy at how fast it works and the results but I am a bit afraid I may take off too much skin too fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t have any instructions other than don&#x27;t use it on wet skin and the standard safety around water type tips. I think some sort of guide from the manufacturer would be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works on the slowest setting with the finest disc to remove pretty heavy calluses in seconds. So if you are aware of the power and go carefully when you begin it&#x27;s a helpful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to this I have the [[ASIN:B005BG5CK6 Emjoi Micro-Pedi Battery Operated Callus Remover]]and it&#x27;s a much gentler remover. It doesn&#x27;t work as quickly  as the Tip 2 Toe. But they are great products to use together. I used the Tip 2 Toe to remove most of the calluses and then the Emjoi to get the rest.</li>
    <li> THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE BEEN NEEDING AND WANTING FOR YEARS!!!!  THANK YOU FOR SELLING THE PERFECT 5 STAR PRODUCT!!!!</li>
    <li> I live in the desert. I hate what the heat and constantly wearing flip flops does to my heels. I have tried everything to stop the deep cracks that would often lead to bleeding; nothing worked. I got pedicures every 4 weeks; nothing. I exfoliated and moisturized every night, but there was so much skin, I couldn&#x27;t make a dent (literally). I was getting really frustrated. I considered buying the Clarisonic foot exfoliator, but everything I read about the product told me it was too weak to treat what I was dealing with. Then I got a plantar wart on my heel. Ick. No matter how much I filed, I couldn&#x27;t get the acid to reach the source of the virus. I turned to this product and the wart was gone in a week! My heels have never looked better. My feet look like I just got a pedicure, EVERY DAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some things you need to know before you use this:&lt;br /&gt;1. It is super powerful. It could probably sand wood, if you turned it up high enough. Leave it on the lowest setting.&lt;br /&gt;2. Wet your feet before you use this. If you apply it to dry skin, you could burn yourself. After you get used to it, you can use it on dry skin, but I still like to soak my feet first so the dead skin is nice and supple.&lt;br /&gt;3. If you can, use this outside. The machine blasts off a ton of dead skin, but it leaves a fine dust all over everything in the process.&lt;br /&gt;4. Be extra careful around toes and between the toes. Do not be adventurous the first time you use it; stick to your heels until you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy! You will be so happy you bought this. It is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how bad our heels are in our family, but let me put it this way...I&#x27;ve used scissors before and cut significant chunks of skin off and still had layers to go. I have cracks that you can put coins into and they go down 1/4 of the way and will stay there....If I karate kicked somebody, there is a good chance i could decapitate them, you get the idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used everything and you guys probably have to, I won&#x27;t bore you with the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is RIDICULOUS! I truly mean that. I never write reviews but this one deserves it. In my first session, I spent about 5 minutes per foot....let me tell you, it got 75-80% of everything off before I decided I should quit for a few days. This is absolutely remarkable if you saw my heels. I wish I had before and after pics. I waited about 5 days and did a second session, My heels were almost perfect with the exception of those really deep cracks I was telling you about. You could see the cracks but are now only a few millimeters deep, no coins!! 3rd session I did a week later and now they were 98% normal heels, I&#x27;ve never seen my heels this good since I was about 12years old. You could see the outline of where those deep cracks were but they were almost gone. A week later, session 4...OMG I could be a foot model. I will have to find a new weapon to thwart my attackers now because my switchblade heels are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this, trust me...buy this.</li>
    <li> This product is not for regular use. if you have a build up then you need professional help to get to were you cab maintain your callus.</li>
    <li> I really love this machine, its works! Within two minutes I achieved what I hoped for (baby smooth feet) It was effortless. I suffer constantly with deep and very painful cracks in my feet. I have tried countless ways of solving the problem but to remove a significant amount of callus, required in the past a great deal of time and effort. This callus remover lived up to its promise and with a great deal of care (its powerful!) it will deliver!</li>
    <li> Like this tool. I have really rough callus feet. I find that this tool is able to do the job and I&#x27;m able to maintain the calluses in between pedicures. The only thing that I found to be a problem is that advertised on the box it says it includes 6 fine and coarse attachments. When I opened the package the attachments were not included. So I was unhappy about that.</li>
    <li> DOES GREAT JOB. MUST GO SLOW OR IT WILL GO THRU SKIN AND BURN. JUST BE CAREFUL. KEEP IT MOVING SO IT DOES NOT BURN</li>
    <li> I really like this  Read the previous reviews before I purchased and was not disappointed at all.  Easy to use.  Just in time for summer and sandals!</li>
    <li> I bought this in spite of some of the reviews that said it burned their feet.  It takes a short period of time to figure out how fast to run it and how much to push down (which slows down the spinning) to avoid this problem.  In the past I have used pumice stone and coarse emery boards to try and file down these calluses- takes forever.  The Professional Electric Callus Remover does the trick! Quick and effective.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my sister. It works as well, even better than she said. My feet feel and look the best they have in years. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not proud to admit this, but my feet are hooves. Yup, it&#x27;s true. Without the regular, high-powered pedicure I&#x27;m left to hide my feet in Summer for the sake of the children who scream when they see them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During my last pedicure, I paid attention and saw that a Tip2Toe Callus Remover was in high-gear. I took a phone pic and once home went to Amazon. There it was! Could this be the very same tool available for home use? Yes...and home use it has gotten. The transformation is amazing. Hooves be gone...forever more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(For those reviewers who complain about the power and burning your skin...you&#x27;re right. I watched how it was used at the salon and here&#x27;s a tip:  Just briefly touch the disk to an area of your foot and pull away. Go to another area and repeat. If you leave the disk in one place for more than a few seconds you will burn yourself. Remember...touch and pull away. It&#x27;s that powerful and a brief touch will do the trick.)</li>
    <li> It messed up my feet. Be very careful when you use this product, because it is going to mess up your feet. So, when you are using it, the body builds more and more of that thing (I forgot the name) and then you end up using it more and more. I threw this this straight in the garbage, and I am using now the classic way. The way I cleaned my feet 20 yrs ago: traditionally.</li>
    <li> Awesome! I have sever calluses on my feet that crack and bleed.  I get pedicures at least every other week to try and keep the callus down, but still have issues.  This lets me sand down the calluses.  It is a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the instructions.  As long as you know how to use these type or electric callus removers, then you are fine.  I had seen one used during pervious peticurs so I was able to use this, but the so called instuctions say to treat your feet as normal and then use the product.  Really!?  No advise on how to apply... no suggestion on speed, pulsing contact, courseness of cap, etc.  You would expect something in the directions.</li>
    <li> I really love this little machine!  It is very powerful and I feel like I am getting professional results right in the privacy of my own home.  It basically pays for itself with the cost of just 1 pedicure that you would get at a salon.  It can be a bit too powerful at times so you have to take it slow but I would much rather have that as opposed to something that just barely took the callus off.  This product is amazing and does the job!  I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Works great but a little difficult to handle!</li>
    <li> I have used it for two months now. It removes callous and corns quickly and effectively. You must use it carefully because it will cause an injury to the skin. I use it on low speed.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product! I wear sandals &amp; flip flops about 90% of the year. Over time, the bottom of my feet and around the back of my heels get callused and rough. This product took care of it all! I used it after a shower so that the dead skin would be a little softer. This is a very powerful tool. I suggest you start on the lowest speed, find the technique that works for you, and bump up the power in the areas that need more attention. I am enjoying my smooth, soft baby feet in my flip flops today, and no next day tenderness!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product .......you can order replacement disc peel and stick...100 for $12.99 at footbuffer.com so much easier and they work with this machine...great for salon use..</li>
    <li> I love this callous buffer. I spend most of the summer barefoot and my feet get so rough. It&#x27;s really hard to keep them smooth and nice looking. I&#x27;ve used Ped eggs for years, but it&#x27;s a lot of elbow grease and I never felt great about the results. I finally broke down and spent the money for this buffer and I LOVE it. Yes, it takes some practice to get the technique just right. But the results are amazing and fast. I love my feet now. I use it a few times a week to keep them perfectly smooth and pretty.</li>
    <li> This will remove thick, hardened callus and it doesn&#x27;t need batteries - I use it and like it. It&#x27;s great if you need something better than a simple &amp;#34;pretty-fier&amp;#34;, if you get my drift. Watch it - it&#x27;s like an industrial sander. First time users should start on slow speed to avoid any surprises.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what other people were talking about, this thing nearly ripped my foot off, it&#x27;s extremely powerful, much more than I need.  I read the reviews and tried to be gentle with this, but I could not use the coarse pad at all and the fine one still ripped off several layers of skin before I could pull it away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent money in diferent products  - less effective - but this one with one time already it made a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful how you use, those ones with batteries are completely different...&lt;br /&gt;watch videos if necessary...</li>
    <li> Best foot buffer ever!  I have tried so many foot buffers, but this one works.  You do have to be gentle or you will feel a burn, but you feet will be smoother than ever.</li>
    <li> the product dosen&#x27;t run in low speed, it does one speed high be careful can burn in sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to find this product.  I purchased it for someone who has very calloused feet.  There are 2 main problems that need to be addressed: the quality of the disks and the speed of the machine.&lt;br /&gt;The disks have sandpaper stickers, both types which are unlabeled and the difference between them is almost indistinguishable.  The speed setting is from fast to faster and if not careful, you can burn through the skin very quickly.  If these features were fixed, I would have given it 5 stars. This item is overpriced considering it falls short on the abovementioned features.</li>
    <li> I found this device to be too powerful.  I wanted something that had more power than battery operated, but this is along the lines of a dremel tool.  I used the fine disk on the lowest setting and tried to lightly touch my heel while continuously moving the remover.  I still burned my skin.  This may be fine for someone with very thick callouses, but it definitely did not work for me.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Awesome&amp;#34; the best callus remover you can get. Got sexy Feet now  im ready for summer:)best product ever.Tried many other but this is the first one im truly happy with. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The tip2toe professional electric callus remover really works to eliminate heel cracks. When used carefully, and repeated weekly, for a couple of months the remover resolved my severe cracked heel issue. I&#x27;ve tried most of the balms and moisturizers, many of the files and shavers as well....I must admit I was skeptical when ordering, however, at high speed and with the course pad on, the tip2toe made dust of my dead skin. I would recommend this product to folks who have deep cracks and callouses. If the remover is applied to healthy skin it will scrub it right off. The box advertises a softer pad for buffing...there is no such thing. The remover takes a very light touch on very hard, rough skin...even then it will produce a burning feeling once the skin comes off, hence the reason for a few sessions over a period of time.</li>
    <li> Speed does not slow down enough. Skips on clients foot.</li>
    <li> I have used many &amp;#34;callus&amp;#34; removers and I was disappointed in all of them.  Then I found Tip2Toe.  This is a wonderful remover.  You control the time you spend on an area which is not long.  The revolutions will create a small burning sensation if the disk is left on one spot too long, so you do need to pay close attention..  I am very pleased with the machine.  Had I have found this a few years back, I would be a few dollars ahead  because I would not have thrown my money away on the other items.  Purchase this and forget the rest!</li>
    <li> So….for those who kind of expect this product to be easy and stupid proof, it isn&#x27;t. Take that with a grain of salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve given yourself a brazilian at home, fearlessly pluck your own brows, own/have used an epilator and would be open to trying home laser hair removal, you&#x27;ll do just fine with this baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, if you cannot stand the thought of your pubes being removed, wince when your brows are plucked by an aesthetician and generally don&#x27;t gravitate towards the DIY beauty this isn&#x27;t for you. Beauty is pain ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is basically a sander for your foot. You have to keep it moving and not concentrate on a specific spot for to long (i.e. &amp;#62; 4 seconds) or your foot will get quite hot from the friction and it REALLY HURTS like a rug burn x 10. This only happened a couple of times and I actually use with a bowl of ice which I periodically dip my heels into to help keep heat from accumulating. The pain dissipates quickly and the &amp;#34;burned&amp;#34; spot doesn&#x27;t hurt afterwards but just FYI, the friction burns from this thing are painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this after no matter what magical foot scrub and/or pumice stone could smooth my feet. I live in a dry cold climate and consequently my feet get very lizard-ish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy - I used to snag pantyhose on my rough feet and/or just generally feel unsexy and this took care of that issue. I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t found any problems with it</li>
    <li> If you use this, it will give you baby heels. I&#x27;ve always had Sahara feet, cracked and bleeding with a touch of Psoriasis while being way to lazy and busy to put all them creams etc on- but this will do the job, FINALLY, and you too get to go out there and not be in pain while looking normal. A+.</li>
    <li> This electric callus remover has some serious power. It&#x27;s a sandpaper power tool disguised as a pedicure accessory. It works really fast, almost so that I use a tapping motion when using it so that it doesn&#x27;t tear too deep into my skin. The lowest setting is incredibly strong. Anything above that is like used to remove grout or something. It&#x27;s a little loud though but it will take you up to 3 minutes to do both your feet. The cord is a reasonable length (9 feet) and it comes with extra head replacements (which you can also buy more if needed for less than $10 a pack). This is some professional industrial grade callus remover. It has a nice design and easy to clean. Overall, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It looked so cheap. I understand that $50.00 is not too much money, but for some people it is. I used it a couple of times and the add on (file)jumped out of its place, so I needed to stop it. Then when I put it where my callus was, it stopped, so I needed to start it again. I think it was too much money for what it really is.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this product. The discs would not stay on and flew off at great speed every time I switched it on. It was extremely noisy and there was a smell of burning and flashes of blue inside when I switched it on. Didn&#x27;t feel the item was safe so I  the sent it back as faulty and received a refund.</li>
    <li> Should be used by professionals only. This is a very powerful piece of equipment.</li>
    <li> This was a VERY good product. I would definitely recommend this seller to others. Just remember to dab it and move it from area to area so as to avoid skin burn.... common sense! ;^)</li>
    <li> Love this product great</li>
    <li> Take care with this - it is an electric sander. When you are done with your feet, refinish your table! Seriously, you need to go easy and carefully. My soles burned even with the lower grade sanding pads - forget the heavy duty ones! It does the job, but you might have a bit of pain. Easy does it.</li>
    <li> My feet are so soft in just one use! This is MUCH nicer and quicker than the battery operated one I bought.</li>
    <li> To avoid burns and cuts, it is necessary to be extremely cautious while using Tip2Toe Electric Callus Remover. Initially, I was going to return this Item, because it is a bit hazardous to use. But I decided to keep it, because it is very effective in removing calluses.  To avoid injury, you must develop a technique of barely allowing the disk to come into contact with your skin. In the meantime, you will feel the sting of this appliance until you develop a light touch.</li>
    <li> For the price of a couple of professional pedicures, you can care for an maintain your feet beautifully, forever !&lt;br /&gt;I have tried all the creams, scrapers and professionally guaranteed devices on the market and nothing even comes close to the results I get from Tip2Toe Professional Electric Callus Remover.  You can smooth off all the dead cracked callus&#x27; down to the healthy new skin underneath and then apply a good moisturizer.  I will never use anything else again!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent tool for home use pedicures. I have used other tools for Pedi&#x27;s but without great results, you can use this with ease and without worry, it gets the job done right the first time.</li>
    <li> Does a great job on callus.  Just be sure to only tap to callus so as not to iritate skin.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife, the unit looks like a hair dryer, it is very handy and easy to use, the unit looks very solid and made with quality materials, you can control the speed and replace the disks to get the right amount of results.  After using it, her feet look like new, my wife loves it.</li>
    <li> I have what I would call severe callus buildup and must remove callus at least once a week on both feet.  I have tried working with this callus remover and find that the speeds are difficult to work with.  To fast and the temperate makes the feet to hot to be useful.  To slow just do not do the trick.  I have been using the parex callus cutter for many years and was hoping to find a better and safer way to remove my callus.  I have stopped using this Tip2Toe remover.  I may have to try again someday.  If I have an additional view I will post it.</li>
    <li> The abrasive disks are way too coarse and the contact surface is not big enough. I&#x27;ve had better luck fighting tough calluses with [[ASIN:B005XUNG5I Powerful Emjoi Micro-Pedi Callus Remover (Latest Edition)]]</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my daughter who suffers from callouses on her feet due to wearing high heel shoes to work every day. She has not used this yet but cannot wait to try it out. I bought it based on all of the positive reviews.</li>
    <li> Scary...that was how I felt after gently applying to skin. Will leave burn marks even with the lightest touch. The speed control is very fast even on the slowest setting. I am considering returning it. I did return it after debating whether I wanted to deal with the burn on a continuing basis. Since then I have purchased another pedicure product on Amazon that does not burn, has variable speeds, and was less expensive.</li>
    <li> turned it on and the top flew off and broke.&lt;br /&gt;total waste of money and since i didnt use it immediatelty, cant return it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have that much callous build up but I wanted to test it for use on my mom&#x27;s callouses.  I only held it to my heel for 2 to 3 seconds.  The heat alone made me stop.  This is only for SERIOUS callouses.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through several Emjoi callus removers, wearing out quickly both a battery powered and a corded model, and had to work for an hour or more each time I tackled my calluses, several times a week.  With the Tip2Toe I just accomplished more in fifteen minutes than I ever did with the Emjoi - it has SERIOUS power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER - my four start rating instead of five is due to the fact that I have to be extremely careful - leaving it on any one spot without moving for even a second produces enough heat to make you jump, meaning that you have to use very short strokes, keep it moving, and watch very closely to make sure you&#x27;re on a callus - it would burn normal skin instantly.  A setting to lower the speed a bit more would be a really good addition, as the slowest setting currently available is higher than I would choose.</li>
    <li> How bad are your feet? If the answer is really bad go with this one. A lot of power. Just remember to tap your foot with it at the lower setting. I got slightly burned in couple of spots but it does remove dead skin quickly, you will learn how to use it. I previously brought the Emjoi Micro-Pedi POWER - Callus Remover which was ok but this one does the job fastest as it is more powerful.</li>
    <li> Removes big callus problems in minutes. Much better than wasting time hand grinding them.</li>
    <li> It must be people with hoofs or their shepards. So if you are sheeple, this tool will work for your hoof trimming. It&#x27;s aggressive sander that will in second burn your flesh. I am thinking what kind of shelf or something I can use this on, certainly not on feet! If you think I was stupid and held this sander at one spot--no, not so. I always read instructions, I am careful. The truth is I bought this, because I was lazy. I will continue using pedi-egg that works really well and is not messy.</li>
    <li> This will remove callus and will have your feet feeling soo smooth. But you better watch the setting...can be dangerous. For beginners put on lowest setting then work your way up depending how big your callus. Just received mine yesterday in the mail. Had it for ten minutes, open it immediately... used It..just fabulous.I was skeptical because usually everyone hype is not mine...but its real...works great.never heard of this until I seen on amazon and then read all reviews. Please believe the HYPE! Stop spending 5, 10, 4, or whatever...spend 50.00...invest into your feet 1 time. u will be satisfied. Then 12 refill come with it. Just try it...don&#x27;t like send back. Mine came in two days. Ordered on Monday...came Wednesday.</li>
    <li> Excelent. We recomend</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I have spent years with small hand scrapers which do very little and are very time consuming.  You do have to be very careful.  Just small light touches and hard dead skin is gone.  My feet are the best they&#x27;ve looked in 20 years.</li>
    <li> does a fine job.....just have to have a light touch&amp;#62; Best use after a foot spa</li>
    <li> The tool is well made, but not what I expected. Had to return, this is definitely for professional use. In my opinion, It is much too powerful for a home pedicure. It is difficult to use this on yourself and very, very easy to slip off the area you are buffing and cut healthy skin. I usually remove the calluses from my feet every other week and go to a salon once a month for a pedicure. I thought this would make the job easier, but, I will go back to my old routine. It&#x27;s much safer.</li>
    <li> There are plenty of really great reviews for this product already. Nonetheless, this is the absolute best callus remover product I have ever used. I therefore feel obligated to at least point out any pros/cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It works fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It works on even the most difficult and stubborn dried, cracked and/or damaged skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It works with very little effort on the user&#x27;s end. No need to apply pressure...it will work just as well without doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t get absurdly hot. If you start to feel the heat is a problem, you can just swap the pad for a new one and resolve this issue. (Of course you can go back and swap back later so as not to waste an entire pad).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Replacement heads are cheap and easily obtained here on Amazon - both the coarse and polishing options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The unit works immediately, right out of the box. No need to pre-charge or assemble anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- For those with fragile hands, this is a lightweight product with a comfortable grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Works well even on dry skin that is *not* pre-soaked or treated with any creams, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Although I mentioned this in the pros, the fact it does get hot and *could* require a swap of the pad mid-job, makes it a con as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above is my personal assessment of this product. I have yet to encounter any other cons and would highly recommend this to anyone in need of such a product. My days of scraping, scrubbing, etc. are over. For years I have tried every approach, product, method, and what not. I have even used straight sandpaper at times. I wish I had discovered this product sooner, but am pleased to have it now at least. In my opinion, this is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> So I read some of the other reviews and here&#x27;s my take:  I love this thing!  It made my heels feel so soft, even going to the nail salon doesn&#x27;t make my heels this soft!  You do have to be careful thought, you cannot just put it against your heel and leave it there. I had to use it in small 1 second increments all over. So I&#x27;d touch my heel, then take it off, then touch it again, then take it off.  If you leave it on there you will feel it burn. Ouch, but I think as long as you use it properly, it works!</li>
    <li> From reading other reviews, I knew this should be a powerful but effective callus remover. I also knew some people had burned or bloody areas of skin from using it. I was being extremely light-handed with the remover with the lighter grid disk and the unit on lowest power. I did not hold the remover in one place but lightly brushed it over areas. I burned several callused spots almost instantly and drew blood in one spot. I can&#x27;t imagine what higher speeds and coarser grits would have done. Unit has been returned. I advise not purchasing this tool but if you do, be very, very careful in its use.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to keep spending $15 here and there to experiment with an inadequate heel and callous remover, so I dove in and bought this one that does not use batteries (is electric). It is definitely worth the money and gets the job done.  It is powerful beyond anything that a battery-operated one can provide, but at the same time if you press down too hard, it does not rotate, which is probably good, so that it doesn&#x27;t damage your softer skin.  It is quick and effective.  Replacements are very easy to order online here. (I still prefer the razor on my heels, but I know you&#x27;re not supposed to use it for health reasons).</li>
    <li> The motor is good, does the job the way I expected. I go to yoga classes with bare feet, they suppose to look good. Once a week is enough.</li>
    <li> Does a good job of smoothing the calluses on my heels.  Be careful when using it that you don&#x27;t take too much callus off---can become sore in that area.</li>
    <li> I went to a beauty parlor and the woman that was giving me a pedicure was using one as this, I knew that it was a must for me to get in order to do my own pedicure...works wonderful...</li>
    <li> I bought this for crafts as I needed a strong yet small sander  ;)  Works fabulously yet very very loud!  I am afraid is too strong for me to use it anywhere close to my feet!</li>
    <li> The perfect weapon when it coves to the battle of calluses. Careful, it goes beyond the call of duty easily.</li>
    <li> I DID NOT LIKE IT BECAUSE THE SPEED IS TO HIGH ON THE LOWER SPEED.</li>
    <li> Wow...I wish I had found this product a long time ago!  Two uses and my heals are as smooth as by 5 year olds!  You will love it!  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I had been searching for a callus remover that wasn&#x27;t underpowered. This is exactly what I was looking for. Yes, it sounds like a jet engine when set for high. And yes, it can be dangerous if you don&#x27;t take your time and be gentle and light handed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the cost of pedicures over time, and the fact that they can never quite remove all the dead skin from your heel, this pedicure dremel is worth the investment.</li>
    <li> My wife has problems with callus formation on her feet.  This tool is the first thing we have used to remove calluses that has had a lasting positive effective.  The unit seems underpowered because it doesn&#x27;t have much torque - the speed of rotation is easily slowed by contact with skin, but that&#x27;s actually a feature that prevents heat formation which is painful.  I use this on a relatively low setting and &#x27;dab&#x27; the discs on my wife&#x27;s feet.  It has prevented cracks from forming during the winter months.  In the past we have used files and razor callus removers.  They work, but this unit allows you to go after places where the skin is hardened or thick, but not necessarily ready to be cut off.  For us, it has been safe and very effective.  The sanding discs last a long time.  I bought extras but over the course of a year, we are still on the first disc.</li>
    <li> So I just got this not too long ago and have only used it once, but that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve needed so far (it&#x27;s been 3 months since I got it).  I developed the dry type of callous.  The one where your skin cracks and the bottom of your feet gets white and a bit stiff.  This resolved the problem in no time.  IT&#x27;S STRONG, so watch out, but it gets the job done.  I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;ll work on different types of callous since I know some people have the callous type that looks like the bottom of your feet is leather-like, so I can only speak for the dry, cracked type.  Great purchase.  Also, I don&#x27;t know how to get replacements, so I&#x27;ll repost once that time comes.</li>
    <li> One of the unfortunate problems associated with diabetes is the build up of calluses , dry cracked heels and thick dry skin on the bottom of the feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than just unsightly if left un treated walking becomes difficult and more serious repercussions can arise from not addressing the problem, good foot care for diabetics is essential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past few years I&#x27;ve tried scrapers, files and blades - along with a myriad of creams and products both over the counter and prescription. They have all had some degree of benefit however I&#x27;ve found the buffers , scrapers and the like cumbersome to use and extremely time consuming. When searching for a better solution I came across this product and decided to give it a go and hoped for the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Luxor Pro Tip 2Toe is an excellent product. I couldn&#x27;t believe how well it performs and how quickly it delivers exceptional results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit itself is designed for professional use and it&#x27;s quite powerful - absolutely nothing I have used in the past has worked so beautifully. The unit looks a bit like a small portable hair drier, has an 8 foot swivel cord which is nice to have, a variable speed adjustment, on/off switch and comes with 6 fine disks and 6 coarse disks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please  note, the fine disks are only for healthy smooth skin, the coarse disks are for tough skin, calluses and related problems. The unit has a built in safety precaution and will stop if you press too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benefits:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Professional Quality - Excellent Build Quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Comes With Everything You Need&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Ready To Use Right Out Of The Box&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Disks Are easy To Replace Both On Amazon And Direct From Manufacturer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* 120/220 Volt Grounded Plug&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Quiet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Extremely Effective&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* 3 Year Warrantee&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips For Best Results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Use After Shower Or Bath&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Make Sure Feet Are Dry But Still Softened By Water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Go Slow - Take Your Time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Keep The Disk Moving Around The Area Being Treated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Do Not Press Down Let The Machine Do The Work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Follow Treatment With A Good Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottoms of my feet look they did thirty years ago - and now walking is much more comfortable and virtually pain free.

    <li> \\&quot;Stop looking ladies, finally, a product that does exactly what it claims. I love this item so very much, just what I&#x27;ve been looking for. Very strong yet gentle when used in the lower setting. Perfect for those stubborn calluses, my feet are now like baby&#x27;s skin after using this product. I love my feet and I love the Tip2Toe Professional Electric Callus Remover, thank you Zali Inc. \\&quot;</li>
    <li> Twenty-ish minutes of use *did* smooth and soften my callouses nicely, but it took about three times longer than it ought to have because the motor is weak enough such that it stops rotating the pads after more than the lightest pressure is applied. So every time I pressed the pad to a callous, the machine would stop rotating, and I&#x27;d have to gingerly move it further and further away from my foot &#x27;til the pressure reduced sufficiently for it to start spinning again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps this is intentional to help keep users from abrading their skin, but it is really inefficient and so makes the task much longer than it ought to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, after all that time it *is* effective. But it surprises me to read other reviewers call this a professional-grade tool. I doubt that very much.</li>
    <li> the best foot file in a world!! taking off what evr callus u have. super fast, good, not noisy motor. highly recomend!</li>
    <li> Works if you have callused feet and a lot easier than doing it the old fashioned way (by hand).  Buy one and try it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything out there to reduce the thick callouses on my husband&#x27;s feet. I pretty much gave up the cause a while back. When I saw this, I decided to give it a try. I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference it made in just one use! You just have I be careful about how much pressure you apply and how high the speed is. Once you get the hang if it, it works amazingly!&lt;br /&gt;For those with just \\&quot;normal\\&quot; callouses, I would suggest the fine discs. If you have those thick, rough callouses that put holes in your socks, the coarse discs are perfect.</li>
    <li> I love this callus remover.  I have a problem with calluses on the bottom of my feet where the metarsal bones are no longer cushioned in the ball of my foot.  The calluses built up so thick that I ended up having a blood blister under them when I did miles of walking.  This remove has helped me by letting me easily sand down the callus so it is more even with the whole bottom of the foot.  Just be careful so you don&#x27;t try to sand down too much.  You will feel the burn.</li>
    <li> I am going to confess something, my feet are hideous. My family make fun my feet all the time and call them barney rubble feet.  I basically walk around barefoot almost 24/7 and never go for pedicures. I would go for a pedi but I am too embarrassed at how bad my feet were.  I will be the first to say I neglect my feet, they are (or should I say were) very callused and stained.  My heels had deep cracks from neglect and three years of being barefoot almost exclusively.  Today my callus remover came and I have to say I am impressed. I shop on amazon ALOT and it takes a lot for me to go out of my way to write a review but this gadget deserves one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, out of the box it looks to be a heavy duty machine. Thick power cord and a decent weight but not cumbersome. It looks built to last. It has enough power on low to do a major overhaul on the hardest and deepest of calluses. User beware this thing packs a punch.  Don&#x27;t spent more than a couple seconds on an area or you will feel the burn quick. Try just tapping the head on your calluses. Go against the direction of the spin because it will run off on you.  It&#x27;s strong enough to sand down thick toenails too. My feet have never looked this good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No worries for lack of power on this thing, if you are looking for a gentle buffer this isn&#x27;t it so if you feet are in decent shape look for something a little less aggressive. If your feet look like they walk over hot coals from time to time, this baby will take care of that in one quick session. My feet are super smooth and look like brand new, albeit a little sore.</li>
    <li> I looked at the reviews before I purchased this product because I have tried everything for my callus feet,frequent pedicures,the egg, Pumic stones and nothing worked.I got mine today and just finish using it and to my amazement the callus are smooth I only used it on low speed and within minutes the callus are soft and smooth,no burn just soft feet they even feel better to walk on. I keep feeling them I can&#x27;t believe this.</li>
    <li> I got this product as a gift recently because I was needing an effective, fast way to soften up my callused heels. I&#x27;ve been using a manual pedicure wand and one of those ped-eggs for years. I felt I was having to use a bit too much elbow grease to get the desired results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the Tip2Toe Professional Electric Callus Remover in my wish list for a while now but wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to get it. Getting it as a gift was a relief. This thing works! Actually, a little too well. I&#x27;ve read many reviews of other callus removers on Amazon and most of them had the same theme: They didn&#x27;t work. Most of the other products said they weren&#x27;t powerful enough and that if you apply any pressure at all, the product stops spinning. Well, that doesn&#x27;t happen with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You actually need to be very careful using this because it is very powerful and will give you quite a burn if you leave it in one spot for too long. It has a dial on it that allows you to adjust the speed. I can&#x27;t conceive of using it any higher than its LOWEST setting. That&#x27;s how powerful this product is. You also need to be VERY light on the pressure you use because it will hurt if it takes off too much skin. I wish the variable speed control went a lot lower than it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - Electric, non-battery-powered product&lt;br /&gt; - Very effective, does exactly what you need it to do&lt;br /&gt; - It comes w/ 12 disks (6 coarse, 6 fine)&lt;br /&gt; - Disks should last quite a long time&lt;br /&gt; - Works fast and doesn&#x27;t take require any effort on your part&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; - Too powerful&lt;br /&gt; - Can easily take off too much skin if you&#x27;re not careful&lt;br /&gt; - Noisy (kinda like a hair dryer)</li>
    <li> OMG!!! this is Thee BEST Ever!!! made My Heels Sooooooo Smooth!!! i didnt say anything &amp; My Husband notices right away! he was like What Have You Done???  i have Never EVER had Nice Smooth Heels until i bought THIS!!!  OMG!!! It&#x27;s Amazing!!!</li>
    <li> Although this product does remove dry skin, it is difficult to use. I say this because it burns your skin so very easily. in order to use it you have to kind of use it like in taps and wipes. don&#x27;t spend the money. i have heard the cheaper versions work so much more efficiently.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been plagued by horrific cracked calluses on my feet for many years.  This machine ground them down very comfortably, didn&#x27;t even hurt when it was used directly on the cracks/splits.  Worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We tried the cheaper battery unit, but that one wasn&#x27;t up to the task.  This wall-current unit has really done the trick.</li>
    <li> Works very well but not fool proof.  Have to use a light steady touch in use.</li>
    <li> This is awesome . I have very dry feet &amp; was excited to get this in ,so immediately&lt;br /&gt;I went to use it. I was careful &amp; read the instructions , it also showed where to&lt;br /&gt;purchase refills at .I justified the cost by another person on here saying it&#x27;s like paying&lt;br /&gt; for 2 pedicure&#x27;s .So tue &amp; I can do it in my own home .The best part is...THE TIP2TOE&lt;br /&gt;IS AWESOME.I may even get another for a gift  .</li>
    <li> Great tool! now I get professional looking pedicures right at home. Even use it on my husband feet. You must use caution if you have never used a product like this before but once you do , you will be hooked!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the BEST pedicure tool&lt;br /&gt;on the market today!!! Will turn your hard dry cracked heels into baby soft smooth heels.. Use it after you feed have soaked in a bath or shower if you use it on dry skin it will burn your heels.. My Heels have never looked better my feet feel amazing</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE, way too fast lowest speed setting is about 4 times too fast.  Generates heat from friction as soon as you touch the skin.</li>
    <li> first, I can&#x27;t believe how fast I received this!  and rather than wrapping presents, I had to try this - only on one foot but it was great!  powerful and I do believe this is going to be one of those things that I can&#x27;t believe I waited this long to buy!</li>
    <li> Was very upset didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Oh yes, this is really good to have, but one has to be careful when using it because it can burn; however it does leave the feet feeling as it indicates silk.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loving this :-)</li>
    <li> My husband has atrocious calluses on his heels with have deep cracks.  This can be dangerous if the cracks bleed.  I have given him files and various pumice stones which did not work.  I was reticent to buy anything that worked on batteries, as I did not think it would provide enough power.  Turns out I was correct.  This device, however,  is electric and is very powerful.  My husband&#x27;s feet are almost back to normal after only two sessions of use!  I highly recommend this over any flimsy, cheap battery-operated device.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on something else that won&#x27;t work or  that is dangerous (callus shaver, cringe). This is a  professional-grade product and the discs have enough coarseness to work efficiently, unlike others I have seen.  Thank you Tip2Toe!&lt;br /&gt;Update, January 6, 2014 -&lt;br /&gt;We have had this product for over a year and it is still going strong!  My husband gives it a rigorous workout every few weeks and we haven&#x27;t had any issues with it.  It is an excellent product and you won&#x27;t be sorry you purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;Update #2, July 2017 -&lt;br /&gt;Still going!  This machine is incredible.  He still uses it on a weekly basis and there have been no issues with functionality.  Excellent quality.</li>
    <li> I was apprehensive about buying this but I am glad I did. It takes a few times to figure out the correct amount of pressure to apply so device doesn&#x27;t shut off. The result will leave you with very soft heals. I use the coarse disks on my heels. Refills are available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The items burns the skin quickly.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Care needed cause it spins so fast you may hurt your feet. But it does work great for me</li>
    <li> Excellent way to soften rough, dry heals.</li>
    <li> This electric callus remover works pretty well until the built in circuit breaker keeps going of every 3 seconds maybe i had a faulty one, i have returned my electric callus remover and ordered another, i&#x27;ll update my review after i use the new electric callus remover.</li>
    <li> Very effective, fast!  I would caution to use as the instructions say, whatever you intend to use it on, SOAK it soft first, 10 minutes should do.  Just taking a shower is good enough for feet.  Dry off and use the Callus remover right away.  My wife and I tried this on dry feet when we first got it and it was BURN city, it really hurt, but with just reading the directions, it made all the difference.</li>
    <li> Powerful little machine. Gotta get the hang of it. I burnt myself a few times. Not bad. This thing really removes dead skin from those feet.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews, but this is the best $50 I have ever spent!  I was going to get pedicures every two weeks, just to take care of my dry heels and calluses (whether I needed them polished or not).  This totally makes your feet baby smooth.  The trick is not to hold it in one spot...you have to TAP the spot you want to treat.  It will burn if you hold it in one spot (duh)!!!!!  I kid you not...my feet are baby soft!!!!  Makes me sooooo happy!!!</li>
    <li> Did not work as well as I hoped it would. Have to be very careful or else it does irritate your skin but I was disappointed that it does not remove callouses very well.</li>
    <li> My wife and I use this on our feet to remove calluses.  Does a great job with fine coarse discs.  You have to be careful and not grind in one spot too long, the friction burn can hurt.  But when used correctly, it does a great job.  The included discs last a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what kind of calluses the people writing 5-start reviews of this have, but for my feet this device is far too powerful and hard to control at the lowest setting with the least abrasive disk. I wouldn&#x27;t have anyone use this on me, and using this on yourself is extremely difficult. As long as you never, even for an instant, touch something that&#x27;s not a callus, this thing \\&quot;works\\&quot; (so would a belt sander). But with the wide circular disks and the torque pulling you off center, it&#x27;s impossible to control. As a result of the extreme care necessary when using this device, I can&#x27;t get the calluses down to the level I want them, and I can&#x27;t use it on one \\&quot;spot\\&quot; callus on my heel at all.</li>
    <li> After actually having to go to a podiatrist for callous removal, I bought to prevent callous build-up, and I use this every. You have to be very careful with it, and I advise starting off with a low speed. The adjustable speed is one of the reasons I like and recommend this product. Take your time so that if you are building up heat, you can pull it away before hurting yourself.</li>
    <li> works well for me.  Once I learned how and when to apply pressure, I have not had any issues and absolutely love this thing.  I still have to use other tools in conjunction with it but I would prefer to have this in my arsenal than not.</li>
    <li> For everyone who is serious about the appearance of their feet, the Tip2Toe is a MUST.  The appearance of the device is deceiving, but 1 flip of the on button makes you understand how powerful it is. I looked at battery powered devices and am very glad I got one that is electric powered.  Battery powered would never be this effective.  After soaking and towel drying my feet, I used the lowest setting with a coarse disc and it made quick work of removing the hard skin from my heels and side of feet.  The hardest part is getting used to the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of the device.  I had best results from a light, dabbing action along my foot.  No pressure is required, just keep it moving.  Again, this thing is extremely powerful, so if you mistakenly let it set on any part of your foot, you will not make that mistake twice.  Ouch.  I was really surprised at how smooth and soft my feet were after just a short period of time.  For those, like me, who hate the amount of time pumice stones, files and emery paddles take to smooth feet, this is a delight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have stated, there are NO directions with this thing.  I learned the most from online info and videos.  Also, a LOW - HIGH  designation on the speed wheel would be helpful instead of just a line.  Nevertheless, after one use, I felt comfortable with the device.  I originally cringed at the $50 price, but that is the cost of 1 good professional pedicure.  My results with the Tip2Toe were better than any pedicure I have ever gotten.  In a nutsell, I love this thing.  One last note:  I purchased an extra 10 pack of discs, but the device comes with 5 coarse and 5 fine, so it will be a while before I need the pack.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on other customers&#x27; reviews and gosh, they were right.  After 15 minutes with this beauty the soles and sides of my feet are smooth, cracks on heels almost gone.  Its powerful though, a couple of places on my feet heated up quickly and painfully for a few seconds when i bore down too hard.  An easy touch on a low speed did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried pumic stones, foot shavers, chemical callus removers and even a drywall sander and nothing came close to working as well as this product.</li>
    <li> I love this thing!  It works great!  After a long, hard winter, my feet are a mess, and this machine made quick work of my calluses.  I highly recommend it!  Well worth the extra money to buy electric rather than battery-powered.</li>
    <li> This little gadget just saved me hours of foot care hassle in a few minutes! It will replace your pumice, your callus-corn-cutting blades, any sanding board gadget you posses, everything! It is worth EVERY PENNY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Powerful&lt;br /&gt;-Nice long cord&lt;br /&gt;-Comes with several discs and a reorder sheet for more&lt;br /&gt;-Fast foot care&lt;br /&gt;-Eliminates need for all other manual, similar-type foot care tools&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-This is barely a con: I think it is assumed that pedicure professionals will be purchasing this item. There are no instructions on HOW to use it on your actual foot. As one of the pros is that it&#x27;s powerful, this can be a con if you are not careful...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use:&lt;br /&gt;I am NOT a professional pedicure person, but I started at the lowest setting on the driest/toughest skin and proceeded gently with light strokes. I noted that if you press down (and I mean lightly) the spinner will slow down, so you&#x27;re not going drill a hole in your foot or anything. Use caution around already soft skin. I used the finer one on the less dry areas--as the description states that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your fabulous feet!</li>
    <li> This products fits exactly with the descripton presented and more. It has a fan that put the debris away from your nose. I would recommend to use a facial mask (to cover the nose) when removing callouses. This device is perfect and has power. Never stops.</li>
    <li> The product is very effective at trimming calluses however, the course trimming pad and the fine trimming pad are nearly the same shade of yellow,  the product can make you foot very hot very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/2015&lt;br /&gt;A much better and much cheaper option is to go and buy a rotary type dremel tool for 10, and harbor freight.  Insert one of sanding bits and sand away calluses.</li>
    <li> I would have given it 5 stars if this callus remover had a lower speed setting. It was ok for my husband because his feet needed a good sanding but for me, which I only had a couple of areas of dead skin, had to use it no more that 3-4 minutes in each foot. Do not use it in an area for more than a few seconds. Tapping it around my foot worked best for me, which avoided getting a burned sensation. This product works great for those who have harsh callus. By the way, my husband and I only worked with the fine disks. The Coarse disks at that lowest speed tried to drill a hole in my foot even if I tapped it lightly on my worst areas.</li>
    <li> I love it, love it, love it!  I hate having to go to the salon just to have a spa.  For only $55 you have your own spa kit at the comfort of your very own home! Just 10 minutes and my feet are supple soft.  Great investment for people with really scaly, yucky, dry feet like mine.  You&#x27;re a new person with Tip2Toe Professional Electric Callus Remover!!!</li>
    <li> This tool is not a cheap imitation.  It&#x27;s substantially built and really does a nice job of keeping callouses under control.</li>
    <li> Difficult and clumsy to use. Can be very painful if one let&#x27;s this Callus Remover get to any uncallused skin by accident.</li>
    <li> This product rocks. It is powerful and certainly smooths rough dry feet. Be careful though as the friction does cause a lot of heat. It&#x27;s a case of touch and move over the hard skin areas. Don&#x27;t hold it on the same place for longer than a second. I wish I had found this product sooner, it would have saved me $$$ on foot creams and pedicures.</li>
    <li> Messed around with the battery powered units for a while - never worked well on my calluses. This thing is incredibly powerful. Like others have said - be careful, it is easy to burn your skin or to hurt yourself, but the unit is definitely NOT underpowered.</li>
    <li> Great product. Like with any device you need to figure out how to use it to achieve best results. On sensitive parts of your skin you may get burnt but not a big deal. The fine filing surface works better for me vs the coarse one. Silly purchase but really awesome change in my pedi routine</li>
    <li> This product does de job but it burn the skin if you stay for more than 4 seconds in the same spot</li>
    <li> Like everyone else has said, this looks and sounds like a small hairdryer but functions similarly to a Dremmel high speed rotary tool. Now, I have used a Dremmel before and wasn&#x27;t particularly bothered when the very high speed rotation over-heated the item I was working on. But when the item is your foot, you will quickly take notice and alter your technique. There&#x27;s a learning curve but it is short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my case I kept the speed at around 30 to 40 percent of its max. That&#x27;s easy to eyeball on the speed dial. Then I adopted a technique of touching a spot and immediately lifting it from that spot. Then touching another spot. This sounds slow, but it&#x27;s the high rotation that quickly does the work here, not pressure or sustained contact. As with a Dremmel, pressure will stop the rotation and even slightly sustained contact will result in too much heat to the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t describe to you how bad my heels were and I am certain you couldn&#x27;t find any that were worse. They looked like something out of a horror film!  I was embarrassed to go for a pedicure. My feet were simply too bad. So, on my own, I tried everything to get rid of the callouses and cracks. I&#x27;ve used all the manual sanders and graters (lots of work for minimal and short lived results).  I&#x27;ve butchered my feet with a cutting blade until my husband insisted I get rid of it.  I also tried the \\&quot;Be Natural Callus Eliminator\\&quot; which people rave about here with absolutely NO result from that product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the short list of instructions and precautions, I loaded the Tip 2 Toe with the course disc. Obviously!  I worked on one foot for 30 minutes. By that time it was smooth to the touch. I could still see tracks where the very deep cracks had been. I would describe the skin as tough but smooth. Shiny actually. Like a polished piece of wood, lol. In my case I believe there is something about my gait which produces excess force on the heels, resulting in thick callouses which eventually crack if unattended to.  I don&#x27;t expect that to change, so callous maintenance will be an ongoing battle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results of using the Tip 2 Toe are similar to the manual sanders, but I&#x27;d say more thorough and requiring far less effort, and less strain on my back.  The first pass took 30 minutes per foot in my extreme case. With regular use I expect a quick touch-up will suffice.  Another difference is the dust. With the manual sanders the dust is heavy enough to fall to the floor. I always work over a towel and then throw it in the laundry. However the dust generated by the Tip 2 Toe is very fine and floats around in the air. My lungs are sensitive and I felt them being affected. I would suggest wearing a mask or going outside which the instructions tell you not to do. I&#x27;m not sure why they say that. My environment was dry and my outlet was grounded.  I felt safe using it outside and it resolved the dust problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I took a chance with this product. My feet are smooth enough after one use that I would feel comfortable going for a pedicure, mostly because I would like someone to paint my nails for me. I plan to maintain my callouses myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the sanding discs, it comes with 6 fine and 6 course. After one hour of use, the course disc still seems usable although it isn&#x27;t as scratchy as an unused disc. I don&#x27;t feel the cost of discs will be prohibitive in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple years ago I developed eczema on my hands. The continuous cycle of itchy blisters, scratching, peeling, and eventual healing had caused the skin to become hard and rough. I found that applying unscented! petroleum jelly at night, covered with white cotton gloves, restored their natural softness. I pull the gloves off after a couple hours. I suspect that I could get a similar softening effect on my feet if I were willing to use the petroleum jelly with some socks on my feet. Haven&#x27;t tried that yet, but now that the thick dead skin is gone, maybe I will.kin is gone, maybe I will.</li>
    <li> I gave this product as a gift. It was broken in the box. I was not informed until after Amazon&#x27;s cut off period for returns. The manufacturer has a very limited warranty many loops to getting a replacement refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend dealing with this product.</li>
    <li> IF YOUR WIFE HAS BAD UNDERNEATH FEET, THIS WILL SAVE YOUR MARRIAGE. MAKE YOUR WIFE&#x27;S FEET SMOOTH AND YOU ARE IN THE GOOD HOUSE, SAVES HOUSERY TOO.</li>
    <li> This product works great. I wish the speed dial went down to a lower speed but all in all this product works great.</li>
    <li> This machine does wonders. I have used it on my mother, myself and a customer. It is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before buying it but some said it wasn&#x27;t a good tool but I found it very efficient. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> this removes the rough cracked skin on your feet immediately, leaving them really smooth.  I found that I don&#x27;t have to use it too often because it removes all the roughness.  I liked that you just plug it in and don&#x27;t need batteries.  All the other products require batteries which do not last.  This is a great product.  I am really pleased.</li>
    <li> This a wonderful piece of machine I found my first one in Suriname, works like magic, my old one broke, a year ago and since then I have been looking for this magic tool. But before I buy this one please tell me if it comes with the disks? and if the company sells the replacement disk.</li>
    <li> I would TOTALLY recommend this product.  I hated going for pedicures only a couple days later to have the heels of my feet feeling rough again.  I have tried the battery operated foot products which are a total waste of money.  This is the best gift I have ever bought for myself.  My feet were so smooth after only using it once. It&#x27;s very easy to use, you just have to get the right speed and technique for your feet. I would HigHLY recommend this product for anyone looking to get rid of calloused cracked feet. I just bought a second one for my daughter.</li>
    <li> THIS IS REALLY A PRODUCT MEANT FOR A PROFESSIONAL OR AT LEAST SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE DOING. YOU CAN SERIOUSLY INJURE YOURSELF BY SANDING TO YOU BLEED IF YOU DON&#x27;T WATCH OUT!</li>
    <li> Very good for those pesky feet.  If you want soft feet this would be the little machine to do it!</li>
    <li> My salon uses these and how I found out about them. A lot better then shaving calluses. This really helps to keep my calluses stay at bay without encouraging any cracks. Wish the disposable disks were cheaper, but now at least you can order them!</li>
    <li> Just like a lot of other reviews stated, this tool is extremely powerful. I&#x27;ve not had it very long, but so far it&#x27;s working great.  Use common sense and be careful.</li>
    <li> For years I have filed, buffed and put creams on my heels. Immediately after I have finished filing, buffing and creaming, smoothness reigns supreme.  However, it&#x27;s always short-lived and I&#x27;m right back in the same position of snagging hose and socks. Too much time has been wasted on useless heel smoothing. Then I bought this electric product. It&#x27;s fabulous, easy, quick and produces long-lasting results. Pedicures produce short-term results for me too. I recommend this product to everyone who wants smooth heels that look nice and feel great. Touch ups are done within a minute or two once a week or as necessary. By the way, another product I use after using the electric product is Sole Food Foot Cream. It&#x27;s a great combination!  You will be in heel-heaven!</li>
    <li> Tried it last night after shower and it worked wonderfully. It is TRUE that this spinner is REALLY strong, I was trying with the black sanding pad (the rougher one), even at the lowest power I can feel my skin is burning if I left it longer than 2 seconds! So I just used the white pad (less rough) with the lowest setting, making sure each contact is gentle or short. My dry feet were cleaned within 2 minutes, put on some coconut oil and I am ready to wear sandals. Will give it a few more tries in coming months to see if the machinery is in good shape, but the box says it comes with 3 years of warrantee, so I am not too worried about it.</li>
    <li> I love the callus remover. It really works and works great. It contains 10 disks . But I gave only 4 stars because you have to be careful with high speeds. The remover can burn your skin if push it on high speeds. I use it only on low and middle speeds and have job done. Also , the disk lasts for long time. New disks cost 10 times less than others callus removers.</li>
    <li> This tool is the best - I&#x27;ve had embarrassingly calloused feet for years, in the summer it seemed like I was always filing with different tools/products to try to keep my feet looking cute in sandals.  Even so, I never got the results I was hoping for - same with professional pedicures.  So I decided to take this thing for a spin... amazing!  After one use there was such a difference I couldn&#x27;t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, I have a healthy fear of this thing.  Make no mistake about it, you are basically taking a high powered electric sander to your flesh - and with one misstep you could really hurt yourself.  This is not the kind of thing you can do while you are watching tv or on the phone (like I used to do with other tools) - you need to focus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, works best after a bath, or plug the shower drain with a washrag and let it back up a bit.  But if you are anything like me (a bit finnicky about cleanliness)... be prepared to jump back in the shower to rinse off the foot dust.  This product makes no attempt to direct or collect it so man, it just flies.  Gross.  But certainly effective!</li>
    <li> I have a parent who has very thickened toe nails.  Using this product helped tremendously.  You do have to be very careful as the Tip2Toe is very powerful.</li>
    <li> I knew I wanted a corded callus remover, which I received in mid-July, this is a very powerful tool.  To help avoid the burning some posters mention, use short-light strokes with the fine disk, and the slowest setting until you become comfortable using it.  Instead of trying to remove all the thick built-up skin at once, I work on my feet a little each day.  This is designed like a mini-hair dryer and I&#x27;m right-handed, so it took using it a few times to find my comfort position when trying to do the left sides of my feet.  A user manual (page) was included.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything. Pedegg. Callous razors. Drywall screens. Pumice stones. Foot \\&quot;graters\\&quot;. Baby foot peels and chemical callous removers. This thing is better than all of them, simply because it sands the dead skin off evenly with less elbow grease. It is powerful, but easy to operate once you ease into maneuvering it. One thing you do need is a steady hand and to remember to move it around a lot or stipple areas. It does heat the skin up quickly from friction if it&#x27;s left in one area for too long. I soaked my feet, dried them, then used this puppy on the dead skin that turned white from the water. It litterally sanded the skin away into a fine powder. I soaked my feet again then sanded the white parts that I missed. Perfectly soft feet. They haven&#x27;t been this nice in over a decade, and it really only took about 45 mins initially because I wanted to be careful and get it all. I probably won&#x27;t have to spend that much time ever again and I&#x27;m so excited for summer. I may even get a pedicure now that I don&#x27;t have to be embarrassed about my dry feet and all the dead skin buildup.</li>
    <li> This product works like a sander. Even at the lowest speed it will quickly remove calluses. So one needs to be gentle and still it may be a burning sensation.  Maybe a the less expensive ones would be gentler.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this, but it&#x27;s like taking a floor sander to your foot.  The sander tip is too large and can&#x27;t get at smaller, hard to reach areas.  The speed goes from really fast to super duper fast.  It&#x27;s actually a bit frightening.  You need to just touch it very lightly and briefly to the callused areas or you get a painful burning sensation.  It is just far too powerful for the delicate job it needs to do.  And it should come with various sized and shaped tips rather than just a big round circle.  I think they need to go back to the drawing board on this one and make some modifications.</li>
    <li> this is the best foot buffer, it&#x27;s fast and easy,I&#x27;m a massage therapist and using my feet to massage people.&lt;br /&gt;It called &amp;#34;ashiatsu&amp;#34; massage.&lt;br /&gt;So my feet needs to be nice and smooth. I can&#x27;t afford to have a pedicure every week so that&#x27;s the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Should carry a warning to not press to hard to the skin.  Motor is too strong for what this machine is used for.</li>
    <li> this product  did the job easy to operate  professional and  powerful for the  hardest  callouses  so powerful from the others i had to be careful a  few seconds on each  and watch out..or youll go to  skin...have to hold steady....  i t works  ....</li>
    <li> I finally found it!&lt;br /&gt;This works amazingly. Over many years I tried many products to remove my tough calluses but nothing worked as effective as this product. It removed my serious calluses in about 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Just warning though, as other reviewer wrote, it is seriously powerful unit. I used lowest level with fine sander (products came with two different types) but, it is very strong. I didn&#x27;t place it on the same spot more than 1 second. I let it touch and lift, touch and lift repeatedly.</li>
    <li> works very good thank you</li>
    <li> It works, this callus sander grinder does what it&#x27;s supposed to...it smooths and sands the balls/heels of my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT I find it better and faster...to remove my big toe callus by...after coming from the shower...use toe nail pliers to pinch/clip away the callus by the chunks.</li>
    <li> I have been an amazon customer for many years however this is the first time&lt;br /&gt;I am posting a review. After trying the tip to toe I felt like I had to post a review. I have never been so happy with a product as I am with this. I have horribly dry feet and get calluses very easily and even pedicures don&#x27;t really make a difference. The first time I tried this product I was impressed. It&#x27;s very powerful so be careful and don&#x27;t apply too much pressure but it really does the job. One of my best busy and I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice now and can&#x27;t say enough great stuff about it!  I&#x27;ve always had problems with calluses on my heels and have used everything from pumice (which doesn&#x27;t work at all) to razor blades to hand held sandpaper device (which works great but I&#x27;m worn out by the time I&#x27;m finished with it).  You won&#x27;t be sorry on this purchase.  It works GREAT!  I&#x27;ve got smooth heels and it works fast!!</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!! It is the same one they use in spas. Super easy to use, convenient and good quality. I&#x27;ve had it for a while now and it works great! I love that it comes with lots of extra round files!</li>
    <li> Love! Saves me time and money! Works well.Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Arrived ahead of schedule. Great sander; simple/quality design makes operation easy. Two sanding pads, coarse and fine work as described. As others have stated, you need be aware that this IS a sander, thus areas that do NOT have callused skin will get inadvertently burned if you are not alert. I suggest using a highlighter on areas that you want to sand before you start. This product is appropriately titled a callus file.</li>
    <li> This product worked well for me.  It was the first time I ever used it.  The heels of my feet get very rough during the winter months, and after using this product, they are now much smoother and better looking!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Works great and was impressed in how much power that little tool has...</li>
    <li> Great product. What the pros use. Buy the extra pads you&#x27;ll be wanting them. Extra long cord improves the ease of use. 2 day shipping took exactly 2 days. Perfect.</li>
    <li> This is a great tool to remove calluses quickly and easily--it&#x27;s basically like a mini-sander for your feet. However, if you aren&#x27;t careful, you can really hurt yourself with it.</li>
    <li> I have a horrible (an understatement) callus on left heel. It took multiple shavings to get the heel back to normal, and half of those times I would cut some of the heel, leading to bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip2Toe Callus Remover took care of the heel callus in one session of about 2 minutes. No bleeding or pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it is a smaller and glorified variable speed sander, but it works well.</li>
    <li> I wear flip flops and go barefoot as much as possible plus I have a thyroid problem - all of which leaves me with very rough hard dry feet, sometimes even cracked and in the winter they can crack and become very painful.  If I get pedicures every two weeks and have them use the shaver on my heels they stay okay.  But that is very expensive!  Someone at work turned me onto this and I bought it.  After using it at night after a shower, it takes maybe 3-4 minutes in total with some shea butter on my feet and into socks for the night I have soft girly feet!  I never thought I could have that.  I have tried almost everything on the market and had given up.  Not anymore!  This was the best thing I could have bought!  Just beware - start out at a low setting and just touch your skin.  The softer and less damaged the skin the quicker it will feel very hot and almost burning.  On my heels I can hold it down and go in circles but on the ball of my feet I only touch and lift, touch and lift.  Be careful until you know where to hold and where not to hold on your own feet.</li>
    <li> This gadget, by far, is the most effective for removing rough skin on my heels, under my big toe, and between the balls of my feet. You have to practice finding right amount of pressure to apply. The motor and sand paper work very quickly. It takes me about 15 minutes to do both feet, only because I&#x27;m careful to touch just the rough spots. Always start gently or you will feel a burning sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It helps to wash your feet afterwards and apply a thick moisturizer like petroleum jelly. It&#x27;s so much easier now to keep my feet looking nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this item because I have such a problem with the bottoms and heels of my&lt;br /&gt;feet becoming calused. I am lucky this works for me and might for someone else.  I researched&lt;br /&gt;Before I purchased and the price was fair&lt;br /&gt;and other users were happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Diabetic and have had serious issues with my feet.  I love this.  Wish I had had this 30 years ago.  Has improved my foot health tremendously.  You know diabetics have to be careful with their feet.  If used properly, you will never have to go to podiatrist for callus removal again.  Pedicures will be such a joy.  I also recommend for older adults.  I am 62 and am able to use this easily.  Sandals, hello!  The sanding disks last a very long  , so order a set and you will most likely never have to order again.  Very loud like a vacuum cleaner.  I have accidently let it slip on occasions so don&#x27;t do that!  It does create dust, but this is so much better than those stupid flesh graters on the market.  Well worth the money, powerful motor.  When I first started getting use to it, I would lightly tap on areas I worked on.  Too much pressure will remove too much, so go easy.  Again if you use this properly and with a light touch you will be thrilled with the results.  My feet have never been in such great shape.&lt;br /&gt;Update 15 May 2017: &lt;br /&gt;I have added this step before using this.  Soak in bath.  Immediately soak feet in apple cider vinegar, I use an inexpensive plastic dish pan--hold it up to your feet in the store to make sure your feet will fit inside the dish pan.  Also get a large jug of apple cider, label it &amp;#34;feet&amp;#34; and you can reuse the cider vinegar over and over.  Just be sure to store it in the container shortly after use so it won&#x27;t evaporate.  Soak feet anywhere from 30 minutes to one hour.  Dry your feet and then use the Tip2Toe callus remover.  First it will eliminate most of the skin dust if you use the remover on dry feet.  Big plus.  I successfully have removed every bit of callus on my feet using this method.  No chemicals used.  All I can say, is this diabetic is thrilled to have feet like a baby&#x27;s.  The motor works harder on soaked feet, so I use a tapping method which is not as hard on the motor and this allows you to control how deep it will go to avoid burns.  You will hear a difference in the motor sound, so keep that in mind again to avoid burns.it will go to avoid burns.  You will hear a difference in the motor sound, so keep that in mind again to avoid burns.</li>
    <li> I have tried IT ALL....food files, pumice stones, lotions, creams, salon pedicures, the egg razor thingy, and the list goes on. Well the search has ended. I will NEVER use anything else on my feet! The powered foot file has made my feet incredibly soft and smooth. Nothing else even compares. Do not hesitate to buy this product!!!</li>
    <li> Ok, now this is a callus remover that WORKS! surprisingly, fast, most importantly effective!</li>
    <li> This product looks and sounds like a mini hair dryer.  It works quite well on dry, cracked and calloused feet. Be careful though.  This product will take you down to healthy sensitive skin very quickly. I would suggest using a slower setting until you are used to it.  Good purchase because even though it was costly, think of how much just two pedicures cost at a salon.  This pays for itself in two visits...that&#x27;s my justification.</li>
    <li> Works extremely beyond belief....moved to Vegas and no lotions, pedicure or any other stuff works...did everything until I discover this.  Everyone should own this if you care how your feet looks&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so thrilled and excited to have find this and made the purchase</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.  It works great! I highly recommend this product to anyone who has problem feet.</li>
    <li> Awesome for really bad calluses!  The fine coarse should be used by professional only because it really does take everything away (including good skin)</li>
    <li> POWERFUL! You could probably do sandblasting with this thing. I can&#x27;t imagine what it would take to have to turn it past the lowest setting. You&#x27;d have to be treating an alligator. Be cautious. It spins fast, gets hot, and will move in your hands. I had to use the bump method. I would suggest watching some YouTube training videos on these things before going to crazy. And don&#x27;t learn on somebody else. You could injure them very quickly.</li>
    <li> I went from feet like doggie pads, to baby smooth beautiful feet in a single afternoon.  I am not kidding.  The Tip2Toe is powerful and should be used with caution---it is extremely effective, however, when you first start using it, test it out and get to know how you will contact your skin.  Don&#x27;t stay in one place for too long, or you could burn yourself from the friction.  I used the coarse discs, and my feet are completely smooth!</li>
    <li> Excellent and very heavy duty. Works well...</li>
    <li> Works excellent just be carefull !!!  You need to press lightly and DO NOT STAY IN ONE PLACE TOO LONG YOU WILL BURN YOUR SKIN!  I used the fine abrasive head and that was enough, cant imagine what the rough one will do!</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase. Product is solid, effective and worth the price.</li>
    <li> Finally a powerful pedicure tool.  Easy to use with multiple speeds and does not turn off or slow down with any little pressure.  Well worth the investment!</li>
    <li> Just days after the one year warranted, the stem that holds the caps broke.  I had enjoyed the device until then.  Wet Brush - is there anything you can do to help me?</li>
    <li> Just be very careful with this, or you can do a number on your feet.  You have to use light touches with it.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Feels very sturdy and does as promised.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is easy to hold. Looks and almost sounds like a small blow dryer. Has a 9 ft cord and makes your feet really smoothe. If you have dry cracked feet this will take care of the problem.</li>
    <li> I would rather be able to walk on beach sand every day to keep my feet soft but that&#x27;s not going to happen, so I was in search of a product that would do the job.  Like a few other reviewers I was tired of buying product after product that were time consuming but offered decent results, so I thought I might as well go for this.  It sure gets the job done! It doesn&#x27;t come with a lot of directions, and honestly I could hardly feel a difference between the finer and coarser sanding pads but it was quick and it was powerful.  I am pleased with it.  Replacement sanding pads are a bit pricey but can be ordered on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with a callus softening liquid product that after reading the directions I thought it might not be something I would want to use, so I have not tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution:  This tool rotates very quickly, slower than a dremel tool but still very fast.  You have to find your \\&quot;touch\\&quot; when using this.  I have found that you have to pay attention to what you are doing or it will take the callus right down to skin in the blink of an eye.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! I have (embarrassingly) dry and cracked heels.  In the summer I would have to spend time every week filing with a course, medium and fine file to get my heels to a place where I wasn&#x27;t embarrassed to wear flip flops.  Even then, it wasn&#x27;t how I really wanted my heels.  After one of the files I used was discontinued I decided to look for something else.  I decided that I wanted something with a motor that would really get the job done.  Most of the products I found had mediocre to bad reviews until I found this one.  I decided to give it a try.  Now that I have it I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll even use a foot file again!  It is very easy to use and works to file the skin away with ease.  I love the adjustable speed.  I keep it about a third of the way up.  The first time I used it (with the course disc) I had the speed set higher and my skin became very warm and felt like it was burning to I turned it down to a slower speed.  The fine disc I can use at a higher speed.  I can file my feel in a few minutes and they look and feel great.  I have used it 4 times so far and both of the discs seem like new, so I suspect that I won&#x27;t need to buy refills for a while.  The only suggestion I have it to start at a slow speed and get used to it before using higher speeds to see what you find comfortable and effective the first couple time.</li>
    <li> I wish I could download pictures of my husband&#x27;s feet before and after using the Tip2Toe. It works like magic! He had so many layers of callus he feet looked like they could use a scalpel instead. That is why I bought this machine. It literally shaved off the dead skin, leaving his feet looking and feeling so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I would advise that you get one of those &amp;#34;foot soak&amp;#34; salts from the store and soak your feet for 10-15 mins before using the Tip2Toe. It softens the dead skin making it easier for the machine to shave.&lt;br /&gt;Also, in severe cases (like my husband&#x27;s), please use a simple mask to cover your nose. There was so much dust it looked like a mini sawmill. I was coughing and sneezing the entire procedure.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything on the market.  I mean everything...scarpers, battery operated tools, softeners, pedicures one a week, vaseline and plastic wrap, lotion five times a day...and nothing has ever done the trick.  I used this last night for the first time and in less than 10 minutes the big thick, cracked calluses that I have had for years and years and years...were gone almost completely.  I used the coarse head for that and I will do more tonight.  I didn&#x27;t want to get down too  far to my healthy skin too fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You definitely do have to get the hang of this thing furst.  I started on the lower setting and worked my way up.  I doubt I&#x27;d ever be able to use on the highest setting.  It&#x27;s amazing and I am so happy I found this.  Literally a life changer.</li>
    <li> Works as promised. I am pleased with this product. Would like it to have different attachments to file nails as well.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully, smooth feet in minutes.</li>
    <li> I have no skill at with pedciures. This is the next best thing then going to get my feet done. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This was a me gift to me all I can say is that it gets the job done just have to be careful not to stay on one spot for too long cause then it will hurt but as far as I am concern very satisfied and no batteries needed no complaints from me</li>
