      <li>When no one is budging on the price I have another &#x27;2nd best&#x27; cream I buy from Skinn cosmetics, its emolient, but not asmany peptides,etc in it, but it holds me over til I can purchase PTR, the cadillac of night cream!</li>
      <li>Also, the Turbo Face Serum and the PTR CC Cream (light touch with this!)</li>
      <li>This is definitely my favorite night cream.  </li>
      <li>Love the night cream  </li>
      <li>This night time creme is probably the most hydrating creme that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Love this night cream -</li>
      <li>I think this product is ok, but overpriced and there is more of the bottle than there is of the moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I have used PTR skin care products from Sephora before, and they seemed to me to work better.</li>
      <li>I love this night cream.  </li>
      <li>I really love this night cream -</li>
      <li>I am a PTR fan and always will be- found him trying a sample product, and while not 100% of my skin care product are PTR, I&#x27;ve got a pretty good collection to choose</li>
      <li>I love it and makes my face feel so good and keeps the dryness away, moisturizes very well.</li>
      <li>This is a very rich, creamy moisture filled night crème.  </li>
      <li>After using PTR Anti-Aging I find that the PTR Mega Rich Intensive is the better product for me.</li>
      <li>this product actually does make a difference, its really good stuff!</li>
      <li>As a brand I strongly recommend him....</li>
      <li>I originally purchased this at full price (ouch!)</li>
      <li>PTR also is known for using the highest levels of the effective ingredients for real results- not just a drop or two.  </li>
      <li>I am happy that I finally found a night cream that works!</li>
      <li>It appears this product has really made a nice difference in the texture of my skin.  </li>
      <li>My face is loving this new cream!  </li>
      <li>Peter Thomas Roth always has high quality ingredients, formulated in his own labs, and breakthrough products.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price!</li>
      <li>I think it is not the original product.</li>
      <li>This is an original product.</li>
      <li>Once applied your skin drinks it up quickly and gets shiny.</li>
      <li>It goes on very smoothly and it only takes a tiny amount to smooth over your skin, which is a good thing since it&#x27;s not an inexpensive moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly with no fragrance and absorbs fast.  </li>
      <li>But I feel this product is worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>It is not as powerful as the turbo serum that I apply in the morning</li>
      <li>I had a wrinkle between between my eyes and laugh lines that PTR Mega RIck Intensive Anti-Aging Cellular Creme literally made disappear.</li>
      <li>It only lasts about a month - would be nice if PTR would come up with a 2 ounce and give us a break on the price.</li>
      <li>I have used so many creams on my face--all of which broke my sensitive skin out--until I used this one.  </li>
      <li>This cream is worth the cost.</li>
      <li>Seemed fresh and arrived without delay.</li>
      <li>Something is not quite right about the texture.  </li>
      <li>I have searched for the right night cream for quite some time.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and it&#x27;s more than half the price than at the store.  </li>
      <li>Finally I found a great quality facial cream!!!</li>
      <li>This was the first time I had purchased this product at a discounted price.  </li>
      <li>this is truly the first product that has made my skin glow when I wake up in the morning.  </li>
      <li>and this is the only night cream I&#x27;m able to use without breaking out.  </li>
      <li>I also ordered the PTR peel pads and hope they live up to the very positive reviews.</li>
      <li>No allergies or breakouts (I&#x27;m very prone to it).</li>
      <li>The retinol, &amp; pads really helped a lot as well.</li>
      <li>Been using this cream for a while and really like it.</li>
      <li>If it had spf, I would REALLY</li>
      <li>I really like the quality of the product line.</li>
      <li>On the rare occasion that I&#x27;ve run out, my skin tells me loud and clear to reorder!!!</li>
      <li>However, PTR Mega Rich Intensive Anti-Aging Cellular Creme did all the same PLUS worked wonders on my skin.</li>
      <li>I could see a big difference in a few hours - face skin more smooth and silky, pores reduced somewhat and just</li>
      <li>My friend highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product, which is very moisturizing, does not cause me to break out and makes my skin feel soft.  </li>
      <li>It really makes a difference to my mature skin.</li>
      <li>My complexion is more supple, soft, luminous and firm.</li>
      <li>My skin feels so soft and radiant!  </li>
      <li>Leaves skin feeling soft and nourished.</li>
      <li>My skin feels and looks so much fresher since starting to use it.</li>
      <li>This cream did it&#x27;s trick with keeping my skin hydrated, soft &amp; supple.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 58 years old.</li>
      <li>It seems it is old.</li>
      <li>I can buy more products cheaper than his from Kohls that also do wonders for my skin and they at least, allow the consumer to use their discounts on every item including perfumes and make up.....</li>
      <li>Discolored and obviously an old product-Seller was accommodating with returning and crediting</li>
      <li>No harsh smells.</li>
      <li>I just want to say, that this is well worth any penny spent.</li>
      <li>I recently strayed and came running right back!</li>
      <li>I alternate the use of this cream every other night with the mega rich anti-aging cellular cream (also by Peter Thomas Roth).</li>
      <li>from Origins to calm it down.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few anti-aging moisturizing creams but none have shown significant improvement such as this product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s formulated to support natural cell turnover, repair daily environmental damage, minimize the appearance of pores, retain moisture, and revitalize skin while you sleep.  </li>
      <li>I have bought this cream direct from the PTR website and the cream was white with a silky consistency.</li>
      <li>I use this product daily and really like it as I do all the other products from Peter Thomas Roth</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the night cream  Paid for 2 oz size and received 1 oz size from seller the Sterling Brothers!!!!!</li>
    <li> I use this night cream in conjunction with [[ASIN:B004EKDS1U Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s Laser-Free Resurfacer with Dragon&#x27;s Blood Complex]] every night before bedtime.  It goes on very smoothly and it only takes a tiny amount to smooth over your skin, which is a good thing since it&#x27;s not an inexpensive moisturizer.  In fact, the cream has a stiff enough consistency in its small container that when you run your finger over the surface, only a small amount comes away...so it is actually a bit difficult to use too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This un-wrinkle night cream contains retinol, glycolic acid, vitamins, and skin moisturizers. It&#x27;s formulated to support natural cell turnover, repair daily environmental damage, minimize the appearance of pores, retain moisture, and revitalize skin while you sleep.  I&#x27;m really happy with the results that the PTR skincare products are giving my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have rated it 5 stars, but the one thing I don&#x27;t care for is the shine that it gives my face for quite a while after applying.</li>
    <li> I really love this night cream - just wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey.  It only lasts about a month - would be nice if PTR would come up with a 2 ounce and give us a break on the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 58 years old. I alternate the use of this cream every other night with the mega rich anti-aging cellular cream (also by Peter Thomas Roth). This cream is unscented, not too thick (it has some consistency to it though) and it doesn&#x27;t get sticky on your face. Once applied your skin drinks it up quickly and gets shiny. It does tons of good to my skin. My complexion is more supple, soft, luminous and firm. The expression lines have been dramatically smoothed out. No allergies or breakouts (I&#x27;m very prone to it). Recomended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few anti-aging moisturizing creams but none have shown significant improvement such as this product.  PTR has a thick creamy consistency.  It goes on smoothly with no fragrance and absorbs fast.  I could see a big difference in a few hours - face skin more smooth and silky, pores reduced somewhat and just overall improvement in skin tone and color.  I had some discoloration from previous dry patches and within a couple of days using PTR, the patchiness in color was totally smoothed out.  I originally purchased this at full price (ouch!) and was happy to see it on Amazon at the reduced price.  My face is loving this new cream!  I&#x27;ll update later on if my opinion changes.  I also ordered the PTR peel pads and hope they live up to the very positive reviews.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for almost 2 years and I refuse to be without it! Amazon has great prices on it to boot.  I recently strayed and came running right back! Awesome, awesome, awesome stuff!!!</li>
    <li> It appears this product has really made a nice difference in the texture of my skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and I am very happy with results!</li>
    <li> I think this product is ok, but overpriced and there is more of the bottle than there is of the moisturizer.  Peter Thomas Roth should start lowering his prices for his products.  I can buy more products cheaper than his from Kohls that also do wonders for my skin and they at least, allow the consumer to use their discounts on every item including perfumes and make up.....</li>
    <li> I love this night cream.  I am in my mid-30s and have slightly oily skin.  I have searched for the right night cream for quite some time.  I have tried less expensive products, but none of them stand up to this cream.  A little dab is enough each night, so the container lasts me 4-6 months.  I highly recommend this product, which is very moisturizing, does not cause me to break out and makes my skin feel soft.  This cream is worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I received the PTR un-wrinkle night cream and am extremely disappointed in the company.  I have bought this cream direct from the PTR website and the cream was white with a silky consistency. When i received the cream from this seller it was a thick,hard and yellow in color.  It was definitely not the same cream i have gotten from peter thomas roth in the past. I would be wary buying anything from this seller again and the cream is being promptly returned.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily and really like it as I do all the other products from Peter Thomas Roth</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t greasy, but it is thicker then some day moisturizers.  Peter Thomas Roth always has high quality ingredients, formulated in his own labs, and breakthrough products.  As a brand I strongly recommend him.... as a product this is the best. All your nutrients, as well as Retinol for anti-aging-  this is truly the first product that has made my skin glow when I wake up in the morning.  And no night &amp;#34;lines&amp;#34; on my face... or around my eyes.  PTR also is known for using the highest levels of the effective ingredients for real results- not just a drop or two.  I am a PTR fan and always will be- found him trying a sample product, and while not 100% of my skin care product are PTR, I&#x27;ve got a pretty good collection to choose from-- but start with this if you&#x27;re looking for a night cream!</li>
    <li> This was the first time I had purchased this product at a discounted price.  I have used it for years.  I suspect that this jar had passed its shelf life.  Something is not quite right about the texture.  It has some graininess, almost as though the product has begun to separate.  It is disappointing.  I will just pay PTR&#x27;s $110 in the future.  Obviously, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, a little expensive</li>
    <li> I have oily and acne prone skin.  I use this very thick moisturizer on my face, particularly in the eye, cheek and forehead areas where my skin is not broken out.  My skin always feels softer and healthier in the mornings after applying this product.  I have used it regularly for the past 5 years and will continue to use it for years to come.</li>
    <li> Finally I found a great quality facial cream!!! This is the only cream I have found that does not make me break out with pimples. It took a bunch of wrinkles away from my eyes and I did not expect that benefit. I originally bought this cream because my face will dry out bad in the Winter time. But now because of the extra benefits I keep using it all year. A little bit of this cream goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I recently found this product and I love it, also thank you for your prices being do affordable so that I could afford it.</li>
    <li> I have used PTR skin care products from Sephora before, and they seemed to me to work better. Not sure how Amazon sources its cosmetics/skin care products, and am wondering if this is the real McCoy.</li>
    <li> This is a very rich, creamy moisture filled night crème.  I want to keep an extra one on hand so I never run out!  My skin feels and looks so much fresher since starting to use it.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many night creams! This is it! I have noticed such a difference in my appearance! I am happy that I finally found a night cream that works!</li>
    <li> I sent this as a gift but I use it too. Great product! I use with the Peter Thomas Roth Retinol.</li>
    <li> Very nice texture, no smell, feels good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks great but I haven&#x27;t remembered to apply this cream every day....</li>
    <li> This night time creme is probably the most hydrating creme that I&#x27;ve used. It is not as powerful as the turbo serum that I apply in the morning but, unlike the serum, this nourishes and softens the skin whereas the turbo tightens it. The two are a great combo.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to be used with the PTR Un-Wrinkle Turbo Face Serum. Older skin has imperfections like dry patches, redness, wrinkles and dark spots. These have all improved for me since using these products. Also, the Turbo Face Serum and the PTR CC Cream (light touch with this!) for daytime. I am 58 and this is a great Summertime skincare combo for me.</li>
    <li> My friend highly recommended. This is an original product. fast shipping, good proctection and good quality.</li>
    <li> sorry didn&#x27;t work for me.... Am using Cellex C which is amazing!</li>
    <li> Excellent service and fantastic product</li>
    <li> PTR un-wrinkle products do a great job and reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. On the rare occasion that I&#x27;ve run out, my skin tells me loud and clear to reorder!!!</li>
    <li> One of the best moisturizers I have ever tried....&lt;br /&gt;and I have tried over 50!  If it had spf, I would REALLY&lt;br /&gt;REALLY like it. It says it is for night but I use it for&lt;br /&gt;day as well, it&#x27;s not too oily for me.</li>
    <li> Been using this cream for a while and really like it. Seemed fresh and arrived without delay.</li>
    <li> Great product. Does what it claims. No harsh smells. Very thick so a little goes a long way. Love it</li>
    <li> I am disappointed in this product. I think it is not the original product. It didn&#x27;t to anything to me. Not even as a moisturizer</li>
    <li> I have used so many creams on my face--all of which broke my sensitive skin out--until I used this one.  My face feels ten years younger and no break outs!!  My skin feels so soft and radiant!  I will use this cream from now on.  Just wonderful.</li>
    <li> This cream did it&#x27;s trick with keeping my skin hydrated, soft &amp; supple. However, PTR Mega Rich Intensive Anti-Aging Cellular Creme did all the same PLUS worked wonders on my skin. I had a wrinkle between between my eyes and laugh lines that PTR Mega RIck Intensive Anti-Aging Cellular Creme literally made disappear. After using PTR Anti-Aging I find that the PTR Mega Rich Intensive is the better product for me.</li>
    <li> Discolored and obviously an old product-Seller was accommodating with returning and crediting</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s my skin...but...I was red as red could be the next morning.  I had to go to Sephora to find some help.  I bought Dr Weils for &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34;  from Origins to calm it down.  Now, that is a five star brand.</li>
    <li> Peter Thomas Roth can be rather expensive.  But I feel this product is worth every penny.  It really makes a difference to my mature skin.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this is an isolated case. The one purchased recently is dry inside when opened. It seems it is old.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product a few times. I love it and makes my face feel so good and keeps the dryness away, moisturizes very well. If not for the cost, somewhat expensive, I would have on hand at all times!</li>
    <li> This is definitely my favorite night cream.  My skin seems to relax when I apply it - wrinkles fade away...I really feel like I am doing something wonderful for my complexion overnight!</li>
    <li> Love this night cream - I saw definite results the next morning.  Leaves skin feeling soft and nourished.</li>
    <li> for me. this product actually does make a difference, its really good stuff! It can be a little pricey for my budget, but I try to shop around and get competitive prices. When no one is budging on the price I have another &#x27;2nd best&#x27; cream I buy from Skinn cosmetics, its emolient, but not asmany peptides,etc in it, but it holds me over til I can purchase PTR, the cadillac of night cream!</li>
    <li> I love this product and it&#x27;s more than half the price than at the store.  The color does have a yellowish tone like some of the reviews state, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to affect the quality of the product.  It makes my skin look hydrated and glowy.</li>
    <li> I started this night cream in a kit I had purchased from QVC. I am so dedicated to this line of products. I had skin discoloration and acne, pkus scarring on my face before. after I tried this anti aging kit, with this night cream, my skin didn&#x27;t even need makeup! The retinol, &amp; pads really helped a lot as well. I just want to say, that this is well worth any penny spent. And not to hesitate on trying these products.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and this is the only night cream I&#x27;m able to use without breaking out.  It&#x27;s well worth the price!</li>
    <li> only used a couple of times bit I can feel the difference of softer smoother skin. I really like the quality of the product line.</li>
