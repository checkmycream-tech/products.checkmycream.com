      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>ladies LOVE this color and want to know what it is and where I got it!!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with this polish!</li>
      <li>The way the color changes as you look at it is amazing.</li>
      <li>Everything is good about this color and how quickly it was delivered.</li>
      <li>Nice and easy to apply and it lasts for almost 1 week.</li>
      <li>Love this polish.  </li>
      <li>This is my daughter&#x27;s and granddaughter&#x27;s favorite nail polish.  </li>
      <li>I love it for the beach.</li>
      <li>I love this shade.</li>
      <li>it appears to be more often than the purplish color in the photo.</li>
      <li>This polish changes color in the light, it&#x27;s unusual but beautiful.</li>
      <li>It changes color depending on teh light</li>
      <li>This one reflects light and changes colors which I have discovered that I like.</li>
      <li>O.P.I. is fast becoming my favorite polish.</li>
      <li>Really cool color--looks holographic.</li>
      <li>so this is my new favorite.</li>
      <li>I picked this color for fun, but seriously have received SO many compliments on this striking and chameleon like polish!  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t believe it to be the original when it starts peeling off the next day.</li>
      <li>I love dark, unusual colors</li>
      <li>goes on smooth, stays on for a long time.</li>
      <li>I thought this would be closer to a gun metal gray, when it has hints of both purple and green, but I still love it.</li>
      <li>Great base for light glitter coat on toe nails for the beach.</li>
      <li>Like any other polish, make sure you let it dry between coats and it will last quite a while without chipping!</li>
      <li>Not only a waste of money but a lengthy clean up as well.</li>
      <li>Exactly the shade of grey I have been looking for for a very long time.</li>
      <li>I put a new top coat on every other day and my mani-pedi lasted at least 3 weeks w/o chipping or peeling!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s dark metallic gray with flecks of purple and green depending on the light.</li>

    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it was pearlized..</li>
    <li> Just 3 days after receiving this bottle of polish the neck snapped off while trying to open bottle. It spilled on furniture and quite simply was a mess.&lt;br /&gt;There was a flaw in the bottle. Not only a waste of money but a lengthy clean up as well.</li>
