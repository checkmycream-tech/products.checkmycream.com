      <li>This item is just okay.  </li>

      <li>Cute hair ties to wear on wrist, and keeps hair in place.</li>

      <li>It was pretty good</li>
      <li>Great colors to choose from and don&#x27;t snap like my old hair ties used to.</li>
      <li>These came in before expected and are wonderful hair ties!</li>
      <li>I love this style hairband, as it never gets tangled in my hair (plus, they&#x27;re super cute).</li>
      <li>Love these bright colors.very cute rather than the standard elastic band.</li>
      <li>The colors are pretty vibrant, and I&#x27;m quite happy with the selection, too.</li>
      <li>Definitely wish I had gotten the 20 or 30 piece sets, but this is still a great value, too.  </li>
      <li>This is a great way to tie hair back without breaking it!</li>
      <li>are my new favorite hair ties!</li>
      <li>But it was my first purchase from this seller, so I wasn&#x27;t sure.  </li>
      <li>the EXACT colors pictured (a nice, consistent surprise).  </li>
      <li>Soft sheen, nice elasticity.  </li>
      <li>They work just as good as regular hair ties.</li>
      <li>The hair ties also get wrinkled quickly.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re really cute and great as hair ties, just not if you have thick hair.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be ordering more!  </li>
      <li>My curly lion&#x27;s mane is a destroyer of combs, an annihilator of brushes, and brings death to rubber bands but these hair ties are like my own personal super hero.</li>
      <li>Great for everyday.</li>
      <li>So far, I am enjoying the colors and the variety that I received.  </li>
      <li>But overall nice hair tie.</li>
      <li>I went directly to the KL site and customized my order for about a buck more.</li>
      <li>The hype is right -these</li>
      <li>They stretch out quite easily and don&#x27;t go back to its original shape.</li>
      <li>I got these for less than $1 per band, which appears to be a good price.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>the seller shipped insanely fast!  </li>
      <li>This is my first time using ties like this.</li>
      <li>But I still like them better than regular hair ties beacuse they do not leave a crease on my wrist</li>
      <li>They actually seem to hold BETTER in fact.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While everyone has unique hair and unique preferences, I can say that I much prefer these ribbon-type elastics for &amp;#34;pineappling&amp;#34; my wavy/curly mop (for sleeping at night) and also for occasional pony tails through out the day.  </li>
      <li>Also very comfortable to wear on the wrist as many women wear a hair tie there just in case they decide to put their hair up later in the day or decide to take it down part way through the day.</li>
      <li>It came out of my hair fine, but did not come out of my white towel.</li>
      <li>I really like these.</li>
      <li>Other than that they work great and surprisingly don&#x27;t crease my hair like every other hair band has in the past even when I have ironed my hair that day.</li>
      <li>fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
      <li>but I like the idea of these ones as well since they do not leave any marks on the hair  and are very gentle and soft.</li>
      <li>Luckily, the ten we got were some of her favorites.</li>
      <li>They hold my thick and long hair beautifully.</li>
      <li>After using these the stretch does not hold up as well as more expensive ones but they are cute colors.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for a little more color variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think they are worth the extra money.</li>
      <li>Too thin, doesn&#x27;t hold hair back that great</li>
      <li>so if you have a pretty elastic ribbon you can literally create the same thing yourself.</li>
      <li>The hair ties are just as advertised and exactly the same as any of the hair ties like this you would find in a store.</li>
      <li>I will definitely re-order KL&#x27;s LARGE pack when it&#x27;s time.</li>
      <li>The hair ties came all jumbled in a clear plastic bag.  </li>
      <li>I prefer these over my old elastic ties.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love these bright colors.very cute rather than the standard elastic band. Bought some for a friend as well. Definitely reccommend.</li>
    <li> I use these all the time in my hair. They are exactly like an expensive anthropologie product but reasonably priced</li>
    <li> These seem to be the best deal for no crease hair ties around. They stretch out quite easily and don&#x27;t go back to its original shape. They are alright. The multicolor pack comes in a variety of colors</li>
    <li> These came in before expected and are wonderful hair ties! The hype is right -these are my new favorite hair ties! Never going back!</li>
    <li> I saw these ties everywhere so I had to purches some for myself and I&#x27;m so glad I did! They came quick and they&#x27;re so cute! I love that I can put my hair up for hours and take it out without a crease!</li>
    <li> These hair ties are OK at best. I bought them as coworkers had said this type of hair tie didn&#x27;t crease or break hair.... not my experience. I DO appreciate that they are easier (and more attractive) to wear on your wrist when not in your hair; doesn&#x27;t leave that indent on your wrist.</li>
    <li> The only drawback is you don&#x27;t get to choose your colors.  They send you the ten colors of their choice. Luckily, the ten we got were some of her favorites.</li>
    <li> Great product! I love this style hairband, as it never gets tangled in my hair (plus, they&#x27;re super cute). The colors are pretty vibrant, and I&#x27;m quite happy with the selection, too. And, bonus points for arriving 2 days early.</li>
    <li> This item is just okay.  The hair ties came all jumbled in a clear plastic bag.  Not what I expected considering the price.  I am really sorry I didn&#x27;t just go to Ulta to get an item I could actually see before I purchased it, which is exactly what I will do next time.</li>
    <li> I have been ordering the expensive brand as I did not know about these. I went directly to the KL site and customized my order for about a buck more. I just noticed a comment that said they are happy to do this for Amazon orders too if you email them.  None frayed...all tied and GREAT! They actually seem to hold BETTER in fact. Good-bye expensive, Hello Kenz Laurenz!  I ordered the expensive Newport Beach-located brand at the same time which is right up the coast.  They still haven&#x27;t come and this is already here from Nebraska! Go figure. I will definitely re-order KL&#x27;s LARGE pack when it&#x27;s time.</li>
    <li> The colors are so adorable, and when they were in the package they were the cutest things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the moment I took them out and used them, they seized up and the shiney part bunched together and refused to stretch. I ended up with roll of cloth that did not stretch, almost at all. This happened for every single hair tie I used, after the first or second use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was very disappointing. I will not be purchasing or suggesting these at all.</li>
    <li> I love em. I have a massive head of curls. Yes, my head is big and so are my curls. :D My curly lion&#x27;s mane is a destroyer of combs, an annihilator of brushes, and brings death to rubber bands but these hair ties are like my own personal super hero. They&#x27;ve saved me from many bad hair days! Plus, they don&#x27;t break off my hair when I pull them off. Bonus!</li>
    <li> The hair ties are just as advertised and exactly the same as any of the hair ties like this you would find in a store.</li>
    <li> Spend the extra money and go with a company that creates a quality product.  This is a low quality product that is packaged in store sandwich bags.</li>
    <li> My only regret is not ordering a larger set!  But it was my first purchase from this seller, so I wasn&#x27;t sure.  Definitely wish I had gotten the 20 or 30 piece sets, but this is still a great value, too.  (Compare to $4 for 5 at Target.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the EXACT colors pictured (a nice, consistent surprise).  Perfectly wrist sized.  Soft sheen, nice elasticity.  Ends are trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the seller shipped insanely fast!  I ordered on the 16th, they shipped the same day, and arrived on the 19th!  They arrive in a cutely labeled sealed package, appropriate for popping into gift bags. I will definitely be ordering more!  Recommend this seller!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While everyone has unique hair and unique preferences, I can say that I much prefer these ribbon-type elastics for &amp;#34;pineappling&amp;#34; my wavy/curly mop (for sleeping at night) and also for occasional pony tails through out the day.  They are more snag-free and avoid tangles.</li>
    <li> I have super thick hair so that&#x27;s probably a factor of this, but when I used these, they creased my hair after just fifteen minutes of having them in. Kind of a pain but oh well. They&#x27;re really cute and great as hair ties, just not if you have thick hair. Unless I&#x27;m using it wrong but I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
    <li> Cute hair ties to wear on wrist, and keeps hair in place. Does not leave a crease. However, I try to limit up-do&#x27;s to prevent breakage and hair loss.  These are much better than the stretchy type you get at the store.</li>
    <li> They are what you see. They arrived promptly. My daughter likes to wear them on her wrist and these don&#x27;t cut off circulation.</li>
    <li> The colors I received were not the colors pictured but a pastel and bright color mix with no neutrals. Other than that they work great and surprisingly don&#x27;t crease my hair like every other hair band has in the past even when I have ironed my hair that day. Also very comfortable to wear on the wrist as many women wear a hair tie there just in case they decide to put their hair up later in the day or decide to take it down part way through the day.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using ties like this. I usually buy the Goody brand ones which are much tighter but I like the idea of these ones as well since they do not leave any marks on the hair  and are very gentle and soft. They are not super stretchy so be careful do not overstretch them. Very simple design too, all you need to do is tie the knot so if you have a pretty elastic ribbon you can literally create the same thing yourself. Good to try out though.</li>
    <li> This hair ties were alright.  Not worth the money.  I have thick hair.  These hair ties still leave a crease in my hair.  The hair ties also get wrinkled quickly.  I don&#x27;t think they are worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> Received these yesterday 12/24 just in time to add to my niece&#x27;s pile of gifts! She was absolutely happy with my purchase! I will be buying some for myself in the future. They hold my thick and long hair beautifully. Thank you for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Sometimes you get weird colors with things like this, but I got a great selection and they are the perfect size and perfect amount of stretchiness.</li>
    <li> I will never buy another type of hair tie. These do the job perfectly, don&#x27;t break, and are very easy to keep track of. Will purchase more if needed.</li>
    <li> I ordered these hair ties knowing that I may get duplicates since it came in a package of 10. I was very pleased when I opened the package that there were no duplicates. There was a variety of colors, and they are all so cute! I know I will use them often. I recommend buying these at such a low price, as they can get pretty pricey depending on the store. I am very happy and might buy some more in the future.</li>
    <li> Too thin, doesn&#x27;t hold hair back that great</li>
    <li> Every single knot had to be tightened upon arrival, which is not a huge deal. I ordered two brands of hair ties at the same time, and was disappointed in these. It&#x27;s not just about the knot, it is about the ends.  They are already starting to fray and I have not even worn them yet. I will have to seal them off myself.  Disappointing, the Lucky Girl Ties were much better, and similar price.</li>
    <li> They came super fast and did are perfect. Great colors to choose from and don&#x27;t snap like my old hair ties used to.</li>
    <li> This product works well and is just as described. I didn&#x27;t receive any duplicates and there were a good variety of colors!</li>
    <li> These ties are so cute. They are also so gentle on your hair and definitely hold without leaving a crease. I have bought many from Kenz Laurenz because her colors and prices are AMAZING!</li>
    <li> These have become so popular lately that I was dying to purchase some but not the expensive ones. Colors are great. However they don&#x27;t hold as tight as the other hair ties that is probably why they don&#x27;t damage your hair. Great for everyday.</li>
    <li> How can I describe my satisfaction toward this product?&lt;br /&gt;1) great hair ties&lt;br /&gt;2) great colors&lt;br /&gt;3) fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;4) GREAT customer service&lt;br /&gt;aight don&#x27;t doubt it. get these hair ties and you won&#x27;t regret it! c:</li>
    <li> Love these, they don&#x27;t leave a line on my hair! Can be used to sleep with hair up as well!</li>
    <li> These stretch out after just one use. They&#x27;re still usable, but I wish they held their elasticity a bit longer.</li>
    <li> I thought this would work after researching and reading reviews for this. They are better than some, and come in nice colors, but they will not stay in think hair.</li>
    <li> They keep coming undone. I use another brand of these every day and these just don&#x27;t cut it like the others.</li>
    <li> OK so they do leave a crease! But I still like them better than regular hair ties beacuse they do not leave a crease on my wrist yet they fit in my hair perfectly!</li>
    <li> Just what you expect and no tangles. They stretch out a little more than I expected but still hold tight.</li>
    <li> It was pretty good but it doesn&#x27;t really stay tight. The elastic gets loose. :( But overall nice hair tie. I don&#x27;t know if I would buy another one.</li>
    <li> Poor quality compared to other brands.  There&#x27;s definitely a reason why these are priced lower than other hair ties.  They have less stretch than other brands and the color fades really quickly.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> They came as featured and it was a great experience.  My daughter showed them to her friends and they liked them also.</li>
    <li> I waited till the price was knocked down and then bought them. I wish you could pick the colors because the colors i recived i did not like, but i guess its a bet. Other than that i think they are usable/nice.</li>
    <li> I got these for less than $1 per band, which appears to be a good price.  The only thing is that since you can&#x27;t choose the colors the variety is a little lacking.  I received 3 beige and 2 dark blue (slightly different colors), purple, white, black, green, and orange.  I was hoping for a little more color variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Don&#x27;t use these on wet hair.  The color bleeds.  It came out of my hair fine, but did not come out of my white towel.</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair, they don&#x27;t really hold my hair up. My friend has thinner hair and she loves them :)</li>
    <li> I love these ties ! Great dela &amp; on time!!! love them!!!  This is a great way to tie hair back without breaking it!</li>
    <li> I saw this product in the mall, but it was just too expensive in the brand names, so I looked here and found something similar.  So far, I am enjoying the colors and the variety that I received.  They do leave a bit of a crease in my hair, but not nearly as much as the old hair ties did.</li>
    <li> These were homemade and not impressive. The prices charged for these is insane. You can spend pennies to make several of these yourself with stretchy cloth ribbon. After a few uses they started to lose their stretch. Garbage. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> After using these the stretch does not hold up as well as more expensive ones but they are cute colors.</li>
    <li> Love.  Love. Love.  Great quality.  Don&#x27;t waste your $ on name brand ones- there is no difference in quality.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed to receive 9 black ties and 1 pink, not as pictured. I chose this set because of colors shown. I regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> these are awseom hair ties.  need to look at buying in volume.</li>
    <li> I really like these. They work just as good as regular hair ties. I bought them because they were so cute. I just wish I could&#x27;ve chosen the colors. I was hoping they&#x27;d send me the pastel colors. Other then that, I really like them.</li>
    <li> As expected, no complaints.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my girls &amp; they absolutely love them!  No creases when they put their hair up!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> These hair ties hold my hair well without pulling my hair too tight.  I prefer these over my old elastic ties.</li>
