      <li>Very fast delivery and happy with product.</li>
      <li>Perfect for personal vanity top or bathroom</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think of it before buying it, so its more of a room for improvement type concern.</li>
      <li>Works pretty good.</li>
      <li>Satisfied with product and received the item quickly!</li>
      <li>This tool organizer looked great on my bathroom countertop, but the two smaller slots don&#x27;t really fit anything.</li>
      <li>Great except no spot for a straightener unless it&#x27;s a tiny one.</li>
      <li>It is light, but it holds my hairdryer, curling iron and straightener without a problem.  </li>
      <li>I thought mine would fit</li>
      <li>Fit all of my styling products.</li>
      <li>So purdy and useful!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better to leave the hot tools on a clear/clean surface.</li>
      <li>so they don&#x27;t fit in the extra spot which would have been nice.</li>
      <li>Good to have..less messy on the top of your drawers.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>It holds our blow dryer with diffuser, flat iron and curling iron nicely.</li>
      <li>Well balanced, holds everything, even when they are hot.</li>
      <li>It would have been nice if there was a little hook on each holder or something.honestly</li>
      <li>but the picture is very deceptive.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping too well made</li>
      <li>metal, very sturdy - fits all of my curling irons in one place</li>
      <li>It somewhat makes it looks a little better then having everything everywhere</li>
      <li>My straightener wouldn&#x27;t fit in the other holes</li>
      <li>I simply just hang it on a empty part of the stand which still keeps it from touching anything while it cools.</li>
      <li>Sturdy and keeps my hot irons off of my wooden beaurea</li>
      <li>mini holders get hot after the tools have been sitting in them for a short amount of time.</li>
      <li>there was no way for this organizer to hold both those items at the same time which completely defeats the purpose of having it.</li>

<li> Both of our brushes have handles that ate too wide</li>
<li> The other issue is cord management.</li>
<li> /&gt;Is a little sharp &amp; rough on bottom, had to put something under so it doesnt scratch vanity</li>
<li> It is also very heavy and durable so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it breaking or knocking over.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a game changer, I no longer have my appliances in a messy wicker basket under my vanity.  </li>
<li> sturdy base, definitely heavy duty enough for dryer, curling iron, straightener and brush....does not tip over when in use.</li>
<li> I have not experienced any problems with it.  </li>
<li> Kinda disappointing.</li>

    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Gift for Granddaughter they will use they well</li>
    <li> Sturdy and keeps my hot irons off of my wooden beaurea</li>
    <li> Satisfied with product and received the item quickly!</li>
    <li> This stand it great! I have my curling wand and blow dryer setting in the holders. My straightener wouldn&#x27;t fit in the other holes I simply just hang it on a empty part of the stand which still keeps it from touching anything while it cools. It is also very heavy and durable so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it breaking or knocking over. It is so handy to have everything in one place and leaves my vanity free from clutter!</li>

    <li> It holds our blow dryer with diffuser, flat iron and curling iron nicely. Both of our brushes have handles that ate too wide so they don&#x27;t fit in the extra spot which would have been nice. The other issue is cord management. It would have been nice if there was a little hook on each holder or something.honestly I didn&#x27;t think of it before buying it, so its more of a room for improvement type concern. Overall its sturdy and keeps hair equipment off the counter.</li>
    <li> It would have 5 stars if the curling iron slots weren&#x27;t all the same size. Overall it&#x27;s sturdy and not overly bulky.</li>
    <li> This sits nicely on my vanity.  The product is sturdy and well made.  It is light, but it holds my hairdryer, curling iron and straightener without a problem.  I have not experienced any problems with it.  The rubber ring on the bottom keeps it in place. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This tool organizer looked great on my bathroom countertop, but the two smaller slots don&#x27;t really fit anything. I have a 1.5&amp;#34; curling iron and a 1&amp;#34; straightener... there was no way for this organizer to hold both those items at the same time which completely defeats the purpose of having it.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery and happy with product.</li>
    <li> Love it! Stays put! Fast shipping too well made</li>
    <li> It convenient design is great!</li>

    <li> Awesome!!!!!! Fit all of my styling products. Sturdy product.</li>
    <li> metal, very sturdy - fits all of my curling irons in one place</li>
    <li> the stand comes unscrewed wayyyyy too often so you&#x27;re constantly tightening the bolts in the bottom. mini holders get hot after the tools have been sitting in them for a short amount of time. It&#x27;s better to leave the hot tools on a clear/clean surface.</li>
    <li> Well balanced, holds everything, even when they are hot. Let me get my curling irons off my vanity.</li>
    <li> Really good quality product!</li>
    <li> Works pretty good. Screw keeps coming loose on bottom though.</li>
