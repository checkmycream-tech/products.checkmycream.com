### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I ordered it in brunette and it looks great!</li>
      <li>One of the best eyebrow gels out there</li>
      <li>This is literally the best brow gel I&#x27;ve ever tried and trust me I have tried over 6 of them.</li>
      <li>color I chose is perfect.  </li>
      <li>I bought the brunette and it matched perfectly.</li>
      <li>but the consistency of the product was really good!</li>
      <li>Great formula and color</li>
      <li>For anyone who is basically creating a brow with this and not just filling in this is great.</li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>and it stays on great,</li>
      <li>Great buy.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s still nice!</li>
      <li>this product applied sparely does a wonderful job at filling and defining them without looking over the top.</li>
      <li>and it still would have looked good.</li>
      <li>I loved it.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use, makes great looking brows.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with this eyebrow gel.</li>
      <li>Love this product!  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>Easy to use, great pigment &amp; waterproof.</li>
      <li>The product is amazing for brows I have barley there brows and</li>
      <li>/&gt;It comes in a nice variety of shades.</li>
      <li>Really well ordered  it eyebrows  were flawless</li>
      <li>lasting power on this product is probably, most notably, the most impressive thing about it.</li>
      <li>I love the gel.  </li>
      <li>The coverage was spotty and the gel kept drying on the brush and more was required.  </li>
      <li>better than Anastasia Beverly Hills dipbrow</li>
      <li>Since switching to this product I get many compliments on my brows and asked what I use.</li>
      <li>And I love the product.</li>
      <li>(but I think that has to do with your brush stroke as well to having more naturally filled in eyebrows)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This eyebrow gel is not as easy to work with as Anastasia&#x27;s Dipbrow.  </li>
      <li>it does not come off easy, every night when taking it off i have to use a makeup remover wipe and scrub it off.</li>
      <li>If you make an error you cannot easily wipe it away to fix it.</li>
      <li>it comes to the consistency of the formula, it dries fairly textured, so getting it to apply smoothly and seamlessly can be challenging, but not impossible.</li>
      <li>If you have no brows (or really light brows)</li>
      <li>I worried that the brunette color would be too light based on what it looked like in the photo.  </li>
      <li>I use it as a highlighter for Contour Effects or light tan mix with tan lotion.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly and it dries really quickly</li>
      <li>I like to take my sweet time to do my makeup, so this is probably the biggest issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would highly suggest this as it goes on very smoothly and stays in place.</li>
      <li>(Quick note about the color</li>
      <li>other than that i love it!!</li>
      <li>barely-there eyebrows or makeup beginners -- since the product is very pigmented -- but for those of you more experienced with makeup (especially with these unforgiving gel type formulas) I would definitely urge you to try it</li>
      <li>but looks more natural.</li>
      <li>I then complete the front of the brow, again without picking up any more product.</li>
      <li>so I suppose they stand out now, which was what I&#x27;ve been trying to achieve and never found the right product before.</li>
      <li>so you have to work very fast.</li>
      <li>very very pigmentation.</li>
      <li>Without picking up any more product on the brush, I then outline the top edge, again starting in the middle.  </li>
      <li>At my age, I don&#x27;t have much hair on my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>Fast processing and shipping .</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Must invest in a decent eyebrow brush tho, or else there is no point in bothering in the product at all.</li>
      <li>like only 1 inches long of gel, but that is okay</li>
      <li>Super easy to apply and a little goes a long way!  </li>
      <li>Next, I blend the top and bottom edges toward the middle, using only the product already on the brush.  </li>
      <li>This brow product functions similarly to ABH&#x27;s Dipbrow Pomade and is considered a dupe for MUFE&#x27;s Aquabrow, however unlike the other two, the NYX Eyebrow Gel performs just as nicely but only at a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>In areas that were sparse, the color was different, much lighter.  </li>
      <li>Brows look natural and well groomed.</li>
      <li>So far I like this product</li>
      <li>you have to work really fast as this dries almost instantly</li>
      <li>Personally, I like the texture -- however too much product, or drying between &amp;#34;coats&amp;#34; will yield results similar to spackle.</li>
      <li>The major issue is that it dries and sets quickly, so you need to seriously work fast.</li>
      <li>In fact, when I first used this product I had fairly mixed feelings about it -- the fickle formula and the fast drying time was a no-go for me, however after familiarizing myself with it a little, I found that it became easier to use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;you barely need to use any at all so this product should last quite a while!</li>
      <li>The only down side is it dries extremely fast</li>
      <li>Fast shipping a little smaller than how it looks online</li>

<li> Smaller than expected!</li>
<li> what I like about it is that it stays in place all day long!  </li>
<li> Cakey, and dry.</li>
<li> so I can&#x27;t comment on the color selection overall, however brunette is a bit lighter and a smidge warmer than ABH Dipbrow in Dark Brown).</li>
<li> I only put a drop on and even then, this lighter brown is too dark.</li>
<li> It was not cheap but it will last a long time.</li>
<li> It also doesn&#x27;t look super fake</li>
<li> As it stands now, I can&#x27;t recommend it because it took me nearly twice as long to do my brows as when I use Dipbrow and the results were simply not as good.</li>
<li> and I didn&#x27;t want waste time sending it back.</li>
<li> But I&#x27;ve only had it a few days.</li>

<li> Usually brunette brow products are too red for my brows</li>

<li> To dark</li>
<li> It has to be squeezed from the tube onto a brush, hard to squeeze out only a little.</li>
<li> The color was a slightly lighter neutral brown than Dipbrow medium brown.  </li>

    <li> you have to work really fast as this dries almost instantly</li>
    <li> This eyebrow gel is not as easy to work with as Anastasia&#x27;s Dipbrow.  It doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly and it dries really quickly so there&#x27;s not a lot of time to blend and to get the color distributed evenly over the brow.  The color was a slightly lighter neutral brown than Dipbrow medium brown.  Once dry, it looked a little flat so that it made my brows look rather harsh.  I was hoping that this product would take the place of Dipbrow, which I&#x27;ve been using since it came out and although I do like it, it can be hard to get just the right amount of product on the brush.  I did the same basic application procedure with the NYX gel that I do with Dipbrow.  I start by tracing the outline of the brow along the lower edge, beginning in the middle and working outward.  Without picking up any more product on the brush, I then outline the top edge, again starting in the middle.  Next, I blend the top and bottom edges toward the middle, using only the product already on the brush.  I then complete the front of the brow, again without picking up any more product. But this procedure didn&#x27;t work as well with the NYX gel.  The coverage was spotty and the gel kept drying on the brush and more was required.  In areas that were sparse, the color was different, much lighter.  This gave my brows an uneven appearance.  I&#x27;m going to attempt to use the NYX gel again in case this was just a beginner&#x27;s trial, but if I have the same results, I will update this review.  As it stands now, I can&#x27;t recommend it because it took me nearly twice as long to do my brows as when I use Dipbrow and the results were simply not as good.</li>
    <li> So far I like this product and it doesn&#x27;t seem to smudge or fade. But I&#x27;ve only had it a few days.</li>
    <li> One of the best eyebrow gels out there</li>
    <li> Cakey, and dry. Stick to dip brow, ladies. Sad because I on the norm love NYX.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected! like only 1 inches long of gel, but that is okay it&#x27;s still nice!</li>
    <li> Arrived in 3 days &amp; I would definitely recommend this for eyebrows but use a e65 small angle brush</li>
    <li> Very similar to Makeup Forever&#x27;s Aqua Brow but looks more natural. Stays all day!</li>
    <li> very very pigmentation. don&#x27;t need a lot when using. i&#x27;ve used it a few times now and it&#x27;s definitely something i need to practice on. lasts all day. it does not come off easy, every night when taking it off i have to use a makeup remover wipe and scrub it off. other than that i love it!!</li>
    <li> Really well ordered  it eyebrows  were flawless</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. And I love the product. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I used to try to darken my eyebrows with mascara, but this gel has me convinced that I should have been trying something different all these years.  I love the gel.  I can define my eyebrows with it without it looking unnatural (like an eyebrow pencil does).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color I chose is perfect.  I would recommend trying a shade lighter than what you&#x27;d think.  That is what I did, and it worked out well.  I worried that the brunette color would be too light based on what it looked like in the photo.  My hair is a light/medium brown, though, so I tried it.  When it is applied, it looks darker than I would expect.  I probably could have gone with the chocolate and it still would have looked good.</li>
    <li> Great formula and color❤ I loved it.</li>
    <li> This brow product functions similarly to ABH&#x27;s Dipbrow Pomade and is considered a dupe for MUFE&#x27;s Aquabrow, however unlike the other two, the NYX Eyebrow Gel performs just as nicely but only at a fraction of the price. Although it can be fickle and fairly difficult to work with, after a little practice -- and a lot of patience -- you can get really amazing, lasting eyebrows. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to those of you that prefer soft/natural/barely-there eyebrows or makeup beginners -- since the product is very pigmented -- but for those of you more experienced with makeup (especially with these unforgiving gel type formulas) I would definitely urge you to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lasting power on this product is probably, most notably, the most impressive thing about it. I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s marketed as waterproof, but it performs otherwise. Between the hot summer months, outdoors, swimming, work and school, you can bet this product won&#x27;t budge in the least. To further test this, I created three swatches on the back of my hand -- one of NYX, ABH, and MUFE -- and found that the NYX outlasted the other two by a longshot. If the longevity of your eyebrow makeup is a concern for you, then definitely try NYX.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to the consistency of the formula, it dries fairly textured, so getting it to apply smoothly and seamlessly can be challenging, but not impossible. Personally, I like the texture -- however too much product, or drying between &amp;#34;coats&amp;#34; will yield results similar to spackle. The major issue is that it dries and sets quickly, so you need to seriously work fast. I like to take my sweet time to do my makeup, so this is probably the biggest issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To say this product has a learning curve would be an understatement. You truly need to be patient and practice a little bit before you&#x27;ll get the results you want. In fact, when I first used this product I had fairly mixed feelings about it -- the fickle formula and the fast drying time was a no-go for me, however after familiarizing myself with it a little, I found that it became easier to use. In the end I think the qualities of this product outshine the initial difficulties it may pose, and would definitely recommend it to eyebrow junkies out there or anyone looking for a killer brow that&#x27;ll last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Quick note about the color: I&#x27;ve only tried this in Brunette so I can&#x27;t comment on the color selection overall, however brunette is a bit lighter and a smidge warmer than ABH Dipbrow in Dark Brown).however after familiarizing myself with it a little, I found that it became easier to use.

    <li> Fast processing and shipping . The product is amazing for brows I have barley there brows and this product applied sparely does a wonderful job at filling and defining them without looking over the top. This is literally the best brow gel I&#x27;ve ever tried and trust me I have tried over 6 of them.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Although I had to practice as I was not use to using gel but let me tell you that this product once it&#x27;s on it stays on and dies not come off till you scrub it off with soap and water. Fast shipping a little smaller than how it looks online but you only need very little product anyway to do brows so should last awhile.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I ordered it in brunette and it looks great! not too cake-y and not too obvious (but I think that has to do with your brush stroke as well to having more naturally filled in eyebrows)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you barely need to use any at all so this product should last quite a while! and it stays on great, im talking STAYS on, through sweating and dancing and late nights lol this is a MUST buy ladies and gents!</li>
    <li> better than Anastasia Beverly Hills dipbrow</li>
    <li> At my age, I don&#x27;t have much hair on my eyebrows. This solves the problem and stays on. It only comes off with makeup remover. I only put a drop on and even then, this lighter brown is too dark. It has to be squeezed from the tube onto a brush, hard to squeeze out only a little.It was not cheap but it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, makes great looking brows. The only down side is it dries extremely fast so you have to work very fast. If you make an error you cannot easily wipe it away to fix it. Practice is needed with using this, especially if your brows are like mine. (I have very thin spotty brows that I like to make thicker and fuller). But after a few uses you do get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;It does stay all day and is NOT easy to remove - which I like. No more worrying about smudging your brows. But you do need to use soap or makeup remover and some elbow grease to get it off. For anyone who is basically creating a brow with this and not just filling in this is great. If you have no brows (or really light brows) I would highly suggest this as it goes on very smoothly and stays in place. It also doesn&#x27;t look super fake it actually looks quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way. It is a small tube but you use a tiny drop for both brows so it will last you quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a nice variety of shades. I was hesitant to buy because my brows are an odd color that I normally cannot match. I bought the brunette and it matched perfectly. Usually brunette brow products are too red for my brows but that was not the problem with this.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, great pigment &amp; waterproof. Brows look natural and well groomed. Since switching to this product I get many compliments on my brows and asked what I use. Nobody ever paid attention before so I suppose they stand out now, which was what I&#x27;ve been trying to achieve and never found the right product before. Must invest in a decent eyebrow brush tho, or else there is no point in bothering in the product at all.</li>
    <li> I got the complete wrong shade :( but the consistency of the product was really good!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this eyebrow gel. I did get the wrong shade,  but that&#x27;s beside the point.  I will definitely return this one and get the correct color. what I like about it is that it stays in place all day long!  Super easy to apply and a little goes a long way!  Definitely a keeper!</li>
    <li> To dark and I didn&#x27;t want waste time sending it back. I use it as a highlighter for Contour Effects or light tan mix with tan lotion.</li>
