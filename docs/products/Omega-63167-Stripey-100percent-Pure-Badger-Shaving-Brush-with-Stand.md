### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I bought this for my husband since internet research said that badger was the best brush</li>
      <li>and he deserves the best.  </li>
      <li>Proraso or the C.O.Bigelow equivalent from bath &amp; Body works can still be used with a cartridge and will leave your face feeling incredible.</li>
      <li>When I switched to Proraso shave cream (tube version, incredible stuff)</li>
      <li>Used it with VDH Deluxe, Col. Conk&#x27;s and Kiss My Face shaving cream (awesome).  </li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
      <li>this is a great brush have been using it for years and</li>
      <li>great brush</li>
      <li>If this is the lower grade badger then the top shelf must be too awesome to use.</li>
      <li>For the price it&#x27;s a great brush for applying shaving cream, good price.</li>
      <li>Worked like a champ, builds a good lather, evenly distributes the shaving cream/soap, and massages the faces.  </li>
      <li>Good badger brush recommended by friends and an online shaving hobbyist community site.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brush now for 3 weeks, and I can&#x27;t believe how good it lathers and how good it feels on my face.</li>
      <li>Really good brush if you are looking for value and quality.</li>
      <li>Looks good, too.  </li>
      <li>If I never tried badger I probably would still be happy, as even a boar brush creates a much better lather than the can of goop</li>
      <li>Pure, Best and Silvertip.  </li>
      <li>Also comes with a stand which is nice and a case.</li>
      <li>This is a great brush and worth the money!</li>
      <li>This brush works up a great lather, is easy to clean and has exhibited no hair loss.</li>
      <li>very soft it lathers up very good</li>
      <li>This brush is definitely better than boar</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t imagine better than this.&lt;br /&gt;Whips</li>
      <li>I started with the Van Derhagen boar brush/ shave kit as most newbies do.</li>
      <li>Much better than the cheaper, stiffer boar&#x27;s hair brushes.</li>
      <li>The boar brush was always more of a watery foam.</li>
      <li>boar is ok</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the boa again and cant say that the badger is infinitely more comfortable</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know that you&#x27;d need a better brush than this one, but it&#x27;s important to know that</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll be able to feel the difference with your first shave, and you&#x27;ll be able to see the difference even before you shave as this badger brush lathers up considerably better than a boar brush.  </li>
      <li>Found it easy to lather soaps and creams.  </li>
      <li>The brush did smell strongly like a...</li>
      <li>It has a full head of badger hair, whips up a great lather fast, and the handle feels good and solid in my hand.</li>
      <li>I am happy that I bought it and saved some money instead of buying a pricier one that serves the same function.</li>
      <li>plastic stand is about as cheap as it gets  </li>
      <li>I personally had forgotten and did not check, but I&#x27;m happy with this brush regardless and recommend it.</li>
      <li>but instead i bought a cheap one at cvs made out of boars hair.</li>
      <li>I bought this to replace a cheap badger brush that was made in China, but I wasn&#x27;t paying attention to the grade.</li>
      <li>It is good so far.</li>
      <li>The included drying stand is nothing special, but it does the job and works fine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say get this brush first if you&#x27;re unsure about paying more for a brush, and then get the Silvertip afterwards if you think it will make a difference.  </li>
      <li>Original opinion:  </li>
      <li>while Silvertip is the high end and the best you can get allegedly.  </li>
      <li>There are 3 grades of badger hair brushes: pure, fine, and silvertip.</li>
      <li>This is a great little purchase.</li>
      <li>I can say that it&#x27;s definitely worth the money over boar brushes.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re starting out with wetshaving, either try this brush, or if you want to go a little cheaper, you could also try out [[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]], which is another excellent low-cost option.</li>
      <li>My first brush so i have nothing to compare it to, it lathers well and works well.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re considering the swap to a double edge shave but aren&#x27;t quite sure yet.</li>
      <li>This is my first shaving brush.    </li>
      <li>This is the first badger brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
      <li>but I would recommend spending a little more money and get a fine or silvertip brush.</li>
      <li>Also, I don&#x27;t know what kind of soap the other posters are using, but I&#x27;ve lost no hairs from the brush</li>
      <li>This brush has pure grade badger hair which is the lowest grade.</li>
      <li>Overall this is a nice brush - bristles are full and soft -HOWEVER, the handle cracked and the entire bristle head fell</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice that the made in China brush was actually fine, the next grade up.</li>
      <li>It comes with its own little stand.</li>
      <li>Brush material is terrific but ruined by absolute cheap plastic.</li>
      <li>This brush really works for me.</li>
      <li>Lathers up very well in a ceramic mug, and hasn&#x27;t shed or smelled on me like some lower cost brushes can.</li>
      <li>i got my straight razor</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not fancy, but it helps hold the brush to let it dry out completely, so that&#x27;s good enough for me.     </li>
      <li>Pure is the low end of badger hair (still easily worth the money over boar)</li>
      <li>Combined with the low price, this is a super deal.</li>
      <li>It makes decent lather combined with my $1.50 shaving cream from Walgreen&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>I bought this to replace an older boar brush, and the upgrade was well worth it, especially at this price.</li>
      <li>The brush lathers really well and is soft and retains water well.</li>
      <li>It does lose a hair or two from time to time but perhaps that&#x27;s normal.</li>
      <li>After using this brush for a few weeks I am extremely pleased with its performance and durability.</li>
      <li>So now we are in the market for a new one.  </li>
      <li>It still looks like new and performs well.       </li>
      <li>Updated opinion: the plastic holder cracked a while ago, but now, after a little more than a year, the plastic handle has cracked in several places.  </li>
      <li>I like the clear handle</li>
      <li>a shaving brush gives him for his sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>So far I have not had any brush hair loss, the brush appears durable.    </li>
      <li>I wont let here near my Omega Stripey.     </li>
      <li>The badger brushes leave a thick healthy lather that holds the warmth to your skin.</li>
      <li>Very disappointing considering the cost of this item, you think they could use a better plastic or maybe something a bit more durable</li>
      <li>For being Pure hair (not Super), this brush is surprisingly soft.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that Amazon puts this huge sticker on the cover and pretty well ruins the cover.</li>
      <li>This brush definitely falls in the upper end as far as quality for price.    </li>
      <li>This was my first badger brush and have been using for a few months now.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really have a problem with the boar bush but after reading all the hype decided to drop a little extra bucks on a badger brush.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This brush really works for me. It has a full head of badger hair, whips up a great lather fast, and the handle feels good and solid in my hand. I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple weeks, but there has been no hair loss at all. Combined with the low price, this is a super deal. Also, this is my second Omega brush, (I like to have a back-up) and I find they make a quality product.</li>
    <li> This is a great little purchase. I&#x27;ve used it now for a month and not lost a single hair. It comes with a cheesy little stand, but it&#x27;s free and it works so I&#x27;m happy. Very soft and whips up a mean lather. Much better than the cheaper, stiffer boar&#x27;s hair brushes.</li>
    <li> After using this brush for a few weeks I am extremely pleased with its performance and durability. Other reviews of other brushes sited concerns of hair loss. This brush works up a great lather, is easy to clean and has exhibited no hair loss. It comes with its own little stand. My only complaint is that Amazon puts this huge sticker on the cover and pretty well ruins the cover. Do not use the old standby WD-40 to remove the label, it ruins this type of plastic.</li>
    <li> This is the first badger brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I can say that it&#x27;s definitely worth the money over boar brushes.  You&#x27;ll be able to feel the difference with your first shave, and you&#x27;ll be able to see the difference even before you shave as this badger brush lathers up considerably better than a boar brush.  So far I have not had any brush hair loss, the brush appears durable.    There are 3 types of badger: Pure, Best and Silvertip.  Pure is the low end of badger hair (still easily worth the money over boar) while Silvertip is the high end and the best you can get allegedly.  I have not yet tried it, but you can find Omega Silvertip brushes on Amazon for about twice the price that you can buy this brush.  I&#x27;d say get this brush first if you&#x27;re unsure about paying more for a brush, and then get the Silvertip afterwards if you think it will make a difference.  I don&#x27;t know that you&#x27;d need a better brush than this one, but it&#x27;s important to know that beforehand.  I personally had forgotten and did not check, but I&#x27;m happy with this brush regardless and recommend it.</li>
    <li> It smells like a dead Badger initially. The smell went away gradually over use. It is good so far.</li>
    <li> This was my first badger brush and have been using for a few months now.  Upgraded from the VDH boar brush and the difference is night and day.  Found it easy to lather soaps and creams.  Used it with VDH Deluxe, Col. Conk&#x27;s and Kiss My Face shaving cream (awesome).  The brush did smell strongly like a...well like a badger, but I shampooed it a few times before use and the smell fades in time and use.</li>
    <li> Really good brush if you are looking for value and quality. The brush lathers really well and is soft and retains water well. Also comes with a stand which is nice and a case. I am happy that I bought it and saved some money instead of buying a pricier one that serves the same function.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an older boar brush, and the upgrade was well worth it, especially at this price. I&#x27;ve been using this brush now for 3 weeks, and I can&#x27;t believe how good it lathers and how good it feels on my face. Also, I don&#x27;t know what kind of soap the other posters are using, but I&#x27;ve lost no hairs from the brush -- I can&#x27;t even pull them out. Looks good, too.  I like the clear handle and it fits my hand well.    Hard to go wrong with this brush, and it even comes with a stand, albeit a cheap stand.</li>
    <li> Brush material is terrific but ruined by absolute cheap plastic. After about 2 weeks the plastic handle began cracking and now I have it held together with duct tape. Also the little plastic holder that comes with it cracked too.  Very disappointing considering the cost of this item, you think they could use a better plastic or maybe something a bit more durable</li>
    <li> My first brush so i have nothing to compare it to, it lathers well and works well. It does lose a hair or two from time to time but perhaps that&#x27;s normal. The brush never had a foul smell to it when i received it, which i was slightly worried about.</li>
    <li> Good badger brush recommended by friends and an online shaving hobbyist community site. Worked like a champ, builds a good lather, evenly distributes the shaving cream/soap, and massages the faces.  The included drying stand is nothing special, but it does the job and works fine.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband because he loves the lather a shaving brush gives him for his sensitive skin. We could not find it in the stores. This is a great brush and worth the money! Now my husband doesn&#x27;t mind shaving again.</li>
    <li> very soft it lathers up very good it dont shed hairs...i should had bought it da day i got my straight razor but instead i bought a cheap one at cvs made out of boars hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for a number of years, and have used quite a few brushes from the super expensive down to the walmart special. This brush definitely falls in the upper end as far as quality for price.    For being Pure hair (not Super), this brush is surprisingly soft. Mine actually is darker than the one shown in the picture, but it&#x27;s not nearly as coarse as some brushes I&#x27;ve had that are made from entirely black bristles. The brush comes in a tube, and the tube cap doubles as a little plastic stand. It&#x27;s not fancy, but it helps hold the brush to let it dry out completely, so that&#x27;s good enough for me.     Lathers up very well in a ceramic mug, and hasn&#x27;t shed or smelled on me like some lower cost brushes can. If you&#x27;re starting out with wetshaving, either try this brush, or if you want to go a little cheaper, you could also try out [[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]], which is another excellent low-cost option.</li>
    <li> Overall this is a nice brush - bristles are full and soft -HOWEVER, the handle cracked and the entire bristle head fell out.&lt;br /&gt;I did not drop it,  I did not bang it etc - do not know what caused the cracks.  I have since glued it all and the brush is now functional but the handle now uneven.  I emailed the company - never heard back from them. I alternate this brush with one purchased from the Art of Shaving.</li>
    <li> Update:    After several weeks/months the brush stopped losing hair. It still looks like new and performs well.       This is my first shaving brush.    It does the job.  I went for badger hair after doing some research....you should too.  It makes decent lather combined with my $1.50 shaving cream from Walgreen&#x27;s.  Only a small amount of shaving soap and this brush does the rest.    Pros    -one of cheapest badger hair brushes on the market  -stand included  -you don&#x27;t have to apply lather with your hands anymore like an animal     Cons    -it loses hair(I find a hair about 25% of the time I shave)  -the plastic stand is about as cheap as it gets  -I wish it was bigger(you get what you pay for)</li>
    <li> Updated opinion: the plastic holder cracked a while ago, but now, after a little more than a year, the plastic handle has cracked in several places.  So now we are in the market for a new one.  These are too expensive to last only a year.    Original opinion:  I bought this for my husband since internet research said that badger was the best brush and he deserves the best.  When it was new, it lost a few bristles and smelled a little like I imagine a wet badger would smell, but both lasted only through the first few uses.  Gets daily use and holds up well.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a couple months into wet D/E shaving. I started with the Van Derhagen boar brush/ shave kit as most newbies do. I didn&#x27;t really have a problem with the boar bush but after reading all the hype decided to drop a little extra bucks on a badger brush. (considering all the $$ I&#x27;m saving from not buying MACH XIV shave cartridges) There is a difference; I found that when creating the lather from the soap puck you needed to work it harder with the Boar brush to get the same richness as the badger does. When I switched to Proraso shave cream (tube version, incredible stuff) the difference became how it laid on your face. The badger brushes leave a thick healthy lather that holds the warmth to your skin. The boar brush was always more of a watery foam. I&#x27;ve tried the boa again and cant say that the badger is infinitely more comfortable but it is noticeable. If I never tried badger I probably would still be happy, as even a boar brush creates a much better lather than the can of goop I used to use (edge gel) but now that I know I wouldn&#x27;t go back. My girlfriend stole the boar brush to use on her legs and loves it. I wont let here near my Omega Stripey.     If you&#x27;re considering the swap to a double edge shave but aren&#x27;t quite sure yet. Proraso or the C.O.Bigelow equivalent from bath &amp; Body works can still be used with a cartridge and will leave your face feeling incredible. I still use Gillette custom plus 3 disposables when I dont have time for a 2 to 3 pass D/E shave. I know I&#x27;m probably making the badger and blade dot com folks cringe but it works for me. This will definitely improve your morning.</li>
    <li> this is a great brush have been using it for years and still the same os i bought it. great brush</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s a great brush for applying shaving cream, good price. I&#x27;ve had mine for years now with no signs of wear and tear.</li>
    <li> There are 3 grades of badger hair brushes: pure, fine, and silvertip. This brush has pure grade badger hair which is the lowest grade. I bought this to replace a cheap badger brush that was made in China, but I wasn&#x27;t paying attention to the grade. I didn&#x27;t notice that the made in China brush was actually fine, the next grade up. This brush is definitely better than boar but I would recommend spending a little more money and get a fine or silvertip brush.</li>
    <li> If this is the lower grade badger then the top shelf must be too awesome to use. This is soft but firm. I can&#x27;t imagine better than this.&lt;br /&gt;Whips my soap into lather in seconds. I like the stand that comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Wee Simpson after this one and like it because of it&#x27;s size. I wish Omega would make one that small. Other than that I like their look and feel.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like Omega&#x27;s synthetics. Flat, bad, limp painters brush.&lt;br /&gt;Omega&#x27;s boar is ok but I&#x27;m a badger fan.</li>
