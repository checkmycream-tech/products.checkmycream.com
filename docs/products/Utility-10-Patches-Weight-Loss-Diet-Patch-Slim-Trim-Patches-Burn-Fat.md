    <li> when i got the pack i flipped out it smelled like i icy hot!!! and it looked nothing like the picture.</li>
    <li> its stupid does not work at all and it took for ever to come don&#x27;t spend the money on this.</li>
    <li> The packaging is good, unopend foil packaging as in the pictures. Has no scent to it, the patches are about 3x3 inches in size.</li>
    <li> In the future I will be purchasing, I  must buy more, they work so well ,I also told my friends about this product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any major change in my size with this product..im not a very heavy person anyway I just have a stomach and that is all.but it really do not wotk</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work at all but I&#x27;m not upset because it was so cheap. It doesn&#x27;t do anything it says it will do. The one star is for the cheap price.</li>
    <li> Well, after using this for 2 nights I am not any thinner but my skin is much softer. It&#x27;s a little weird because I hardly ever put on face cream. I am going to do all 10 days and post another review.</li>
    <li> Still waiting for my things to come in the mail it&#x27;s been over a month now and I still don&#x27;t have it.</li>
    <li> This product is just people who think the patch work mentally but physically it doesn&#x27;t work.. So it don&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Order these patches, and utilize, but also to use them, change my feed, so I began to lose weight and attributed this to the patches, so ordered seven more packages, which do not utilize, it produced me a huge itch! I despaired of much itching, itself, try to investigate the ingredients of these patches, but everything is in Chinese language! Recommend that if?? Obviously not!</li>
    <li> Not sure how or why I fell for this gimmick. DUH. Felt nothing. Did nothing. TOOK 2 SO.ID MTHS TO ARRIVE. Leaves an inflamed red area when you remove. Utterly useless.</li>
    <li> they seem to change your mood and make you feel better did nothing for my snakeing though or weight loss</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really see the results. I don&#x27;t know if that why i use it for a short time.</li>
    <li> Patches instructions are in a foreign language so I am not sure the correct way to use the product.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t work waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought these to try out and haven&#x27;t seen a decrease or increase yet but it has only been a few days.  The price to give them a try is great so it is worth it to just try out.  I will update my review after I have had longer use.  I would suggest including an English ingredient description in the package though, it will help with those who have health concerns.</li>
    <li> Does NOT work at all! I used 3 of them, ans none of them did nothin at all! Do not waste your money</li>
    <li> I expected my order to be here on, or maybe even a little after the expected date, but still, it is not here. Your confusing messages did not help at all. I just want my order to be here already. This is ridiculous.</li>
    <li> i have not seen any results from this patch. The only thing lost is the money to buy it. No instructions were inclosed and it came from China so even the address was in Chinese. I would advise no one to buy it.</li>
    <li> Not sure what to do or how it works because all written in Chinese. Leaves a Mark on you stomach when you take it off.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t appear to do anything else. Seller was good product came earlier that told it would.</li>
    <li> just didn&#x27;t seem to work no results this just seems like a waste of money although it was cheap I guess you get what you pay for. lol</li>
    <li> Not good at all. You should discontinue this item. Everything it says it&#x27;s suppose to do is not true. I give it a very bad rating.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste ur time. Worthless patches.</li>
    <li> I got mine when you could for $2.77 and I&#x27;m gal I did because it isn&#x27;t really even worth that, sadly. I&#x27;ll be warning my friends and family to stay away from this product. Weighing myself and checking inches-- nothing changed over the 10 day period. It also has a very strong smell of Icey-Hot and feels like it when you put it on (for all I know, that&#x27;s all it could be).</li>
    <li> I was thinking of ordering this product but after reading the review I won&#x27;t buy it. Plus the directions on how to use was not explained good and I was confused when I was done reading everything.</li>
