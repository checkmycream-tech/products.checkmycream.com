      <li>Priced much cheaper here than on other websites.</li>
      <li>in a really thick, pudding consistency you have to scoop it out, which means finding a place to put the lid, getting it evenly distributed, getting the lid back on securely, etc etc..</li>

<li> /&gt;Where it did seem to perform was with the product line&#x27;s leave-in and styling cream when I used a flat iron.</li>
<li> I have coarse curly dry hair and using this made my hair feel like I ran dish detergent through it.</li>
<li> and I love to blow it straight but hate the frizz.  </li>
<li> Really thick does not translate to really effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> My hair was dry and breaking off.</li>
<li> I keep trying to find cheaper alternatives but so far nothing works as well as this stuff for my aging, coarse, thick, wavy, frizzy hair.</li>
<li> I only shampoo once a week, but condition everyday, and let it dry naturally, usually with no other styling aid or in a ponytail.</li>
<li> Came with a free oil sample which I am also crazy about.  </li>
<li> This product left my hair limp and greasy.</li>
<li> However, I still need to add other stuff afterwards to control the frizz.</li>
<li> Not worth the money at all.</li>
<li> The packaging, while cute on the shelf is annoying in the shower.</li>
<li> So i swtiched shampoo/ conditoners and ill go back to davines later to see if it works again.</li>
<li> You have to experiment w/amount because too little and it won&#x27;t work.</li>
<li> My hair is very dry and thick.</li>
<li> The container is thin cheap plastic which was disappointing for the cost of the product.  </li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;Excellent for harsh and frizzy hair.</li>
<li> John Frieda Frizz Ease Secret Weapon Touch-Up Creme w/ 4-5 pumps of Frizz Ease Extra Strength 6 Effects Serum does the trick.</li>
<li> I expected this conditioner to at least moisturize, and it didn&#x27;t.</li>
<li> Confused, my family has been using this product for the past 10 years and either it&#x27;s recently been reformatted or what I received was counterfeit.</li>
<li> It comes in a very plain plastic tub, it is very thick, and it lasts a long time.</li>
<li> You need very little of this product, it lasts a while.</li>
<li> It was always so hard for me to brush my hair after I shampoo it.</li>
<li> Industrial is the term that comes to mind, hardly a &#x27;crafted&#x27; blend.</li>
<li> I have thick, corse, curly hair that I spend a lot of time straightening.</li>
<li> As a stand alone product (used with their shampoo, as directed) this fails to provide any of their stated outcomes.</li>
<li> I had these tub type things, but it isn&#x27;t bad.  </li>

    <li> I love this conditioner along with its sister shampoo. I find the Davines products lovely smelling and creamy and rich in texture. I have very wavy hair and these products help keep my hair relaxed and shiny.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this conditioner. My hair is very dry and thick. It was always so hard for me to brush my hair after I shampoo it. Not anymore. This product is fantastic. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Not the miracle I was hoping for! I have thick, corse, curly hair that I spend a lot of time straightening. This product left my hair limp and greasy. Not worth the money at all. Try Wen if you have the same hair problems as I do. It&#x27;s the miracle I have been searching for!</li>
    <li> I keep trying to find cheaper alternatives but so far nothing works as well as this stuff for my aging, coarse, thick, wavy, frizzy hair. It makes my hair soft. However, I still need to add other stuff afterwards to control the frizz. Davines makes some good styling creams but I&#x27;ve found mixing a marble-size ball of John Frieda Frizz Ease Secret Weapon Touch-Up Creme w/ 4-5 pumps of Frizz Ease Extra Strength 6 Effects Serum does the trick. And I have short hair!! You have to experiment w/amount because too little and it won&#x27;t work. These Frizz Ease products are much cheaper than Davines and work as well.</li>
    <li> Recommended by our stylist for textured hair. Works as well at home as it does in the salon. Good price, too.</li>
    <li> I have slightly coarse hair that tends to friz easily. The Love conditioner smells fantastic, is mild and helps control the friz.

    <li> Bought this because I tried it at my salon.  I had these tub type things, but it isn&#x27;t bad.  Makes my haid super soft after every wash so far.</li>
    <li> I bought this as suggested by my hair dresser who is actually amazing. But i have to disagree with him on this one. I have coarse curly dry hair and using this made my hair feel like I ran dish detergent through it. Never have I felt this even with drugstore conditioners. Key word conditioner! Not this one. The packaging, while cute on the shelf is annoying in the shower. The top collects water and you have to manuever getting the lid off without shower water diluting it.  I have tried the Unite smoothing shampoo and conditioner and these are really nice but only salon available. I will look at other reviews to get something better.</li>

Industrial is the term that comes to mind, hardly a &#x27;crafted&#x27; blend. Nothing about this conditioner, as a stand-alone product, was smoothing nor did it have any \\&quot;control\\&quot; over frizz. It didn&#x27;t particularly shine any more than clean hair already does. I expected this conditioner to at least moisturize, and it didn&#x27;t. I only shampoo once a week, but condition everyday, and let it dry naturally, usually with no other styling aid or in a ponytail. The first time I tried this all I got was frizz...it &#x27;softens&#x27;, it doesn&#x27;t moisturize....big difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I really came to dislike the tub (container) it comes in.

    <li> I ordered this and the matching shampoo for my wife.  She is in love.  Smells nice and leaves the hair soft.</li>
    <li> I do love davines products but i am rating with 3stars because after my first bottle, i bought another and it did not have the same wonderful affect in my hair. Instead be being full and smooth and shiny. My hair was dry and breaking off. So i swtiched shampoo/ conditoners and ill go back to davines later to see if it works again. The smell is wonderful....almost worth having dry hair for :)</li>
    <li> This is the only product that works on my 5 year old grandsons hair.  He prefers this over the blue and white formulas.  His hair is very long and very curly, I highly recommend</li>
    <li> Confused, my family has been using this product for the past 10 years and either it&#x27;s recently been reformatted or what I received was counterfeit. It was lavender in color vs pale pink and distinctly smelled different. YUCK!</li>
