    <li> i have trouble with my hair turning to fur. i have tried every shine spray there is...either they have alcohol in them or they are too greasy or are not moist enough and you have to keep re-applying.&lt;br /&gt;this one is perfect...no ingredients bad for your hair. smells good. moistens the most stubborn damaged frizz of hair but doesn&#x27;t dry greasy&lt;br /&gt;drugstore.com won&#x27;t charge you shipping on it if your order $25 worth of stuff</li>
    <li> I expected this product to soak any dirt or oil, but it leaves a white residue that takes a long time to dry.</li>
    <li> Annoying plastic label on bottle slips around making it impossible to pump so I had to cut it off. Product is ok - adds shine without feeling greasy or heavy.</li>
    <li> i like that but i am not loving it because it is just an oil. it makes my hair look greesy</li>
    <li> reminds me of brilliantine. a little too oily but it works, just use sparingly. good product</li>
    <li> it does make your hair shiny, but I do not like the smell. Biosilk and john frieda works better and smells awesome. I will not buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> If you want it- GET IT. I can&#x27;t find this spray in stores anymore!!!! I finally found it here, and bought 2. The smell is a sweet coconut scent- it&#x27;s amazing. You&#x27;re hair will feel unbelievably silky &amp; smell like a majestic mane. &amp;#60;-- oh, yes I did!! And yes, my mane is majestic.. Really, you&#x27;ll love it.  Lightly mist- it can make your hair look oily if you put too much on, or spray to close to your head/roots.</li>
    <li> Super greasy. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> My hair felt greasy when I used the product</li>
    <li> It really does make your hair shine. It has sort of an odd smell, but it&#x27;s a good one. I spray it more liberally towards the bottom of my hair, and just mist it slightly on my scalp, or else my hair ends up looking greasy. I got it for $2.50 at my local Urban Outfitters (50% off clearance sale!) and it was beyond worth it, I went back and got another bottle!</li>
    <li> I have fine thin hair and I thought nothing would really work  having tried many hair products .  Then my niece turned me onto to this product  and oh my God it is fantastic!  I have so much more body and it gives me so many options when styling my hair.  I had to play around with just how much I could use without - overly too much product.  I have tried other products in this line and like all of them.</li>
    <li> Way to greasy for my thin hair. erin</li>
    <li> Not Your mothers let me review their products. These smell so good. Just like candy. They work really well and doesn&#x27;t make your hair dirty or oily the next day after a shower.  I love the detangler conditioner it works really good and you only need a few sprays. Starting at the bottom of your hair working your way up then just brush away and no tangles! I have thick hair and I need any help I can get when it comes to brushing the hair. Then I just flat iron my hair out! The shine mist is awesome smells like candy and shines the hair for hours. I am into shines sprays right now since its almost summer and the sun is out, you need that shine. Both products work great and make your hair smell good, and keeps hair pretty and not frizzy. Great CS and they ship fast to!</li>
    <li> Smells okay, but pump on bottle didn&#x27;t work very well and I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> The product works as I expected it would. A little oily but that is too be expected with a shine spray.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product. made my frizzy hair much smoother and extremely healthy/shiny. i would recommend this product to absolutely anyone</li>
    <li> The smell is sweet,but in a good way.Makes hair shiny and silky.</li>
    <li> It is okay ,but Garnier Fructis Sleek Shine Anti-Frizz Serum / shine spray works much better in my personal opinion.</li>
    <li> I love this shine mist! It smells so good...like candy. It isn&#x27;t too heavy, and really makes my hair look shinier and healthier.</li>
    <li> Loved this product. it keeps my hair silky smooth while smelling amazing, i definately recomend it!!!not your mothers products never dissapoint and have became a perminant addition to my daily routin</li>
