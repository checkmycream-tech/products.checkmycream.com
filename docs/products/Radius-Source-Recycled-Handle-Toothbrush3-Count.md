      <li>but it was nice and soft and felt good (no poking into gums like some).</li>
      <li>am giving this product 5 stars because if I hadn&#x27;t followed some of the reviews and ordered the soft bristled toothbrushes instead of the medium I would have been 100% happy with this product.</li>
      <li>The size is also comfortable and makes you feel like your getting a better clean.</li>

      <li>I still have the original handle and just switch out the heads.</li>
      <li>My mouth feels so clean after using this.</li>
      <li>I imagine the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; wouldn&#x27;t clean your teeth at all.  </li>
      <li>It does clean well though.  </li>
      <li>medium is just right!</li>
      <li>A better description saying that they will all be the same material would have been more accurate.  </li>
      <li>Your mouth feels fresh and no plaque on the teeth, so that&#x27;s the important thing here.  </li>
      <li>I got one of these toothbrushes as a gift and have since bought about ten more for my family and friends!</li>
      <li>This tooth brush makes life worth living.</li>
      <li>Far better than the original radius with the left and right hand toothbrushes.  </li>
      <li>It definitely seems to do a better job cleaning our teeth.</li>
      <li>But along came the Radius Source Recycled Handle Toothbrush, Medium, Assorted Colors (3 count)… and I was reconverted to modern dental hygiene!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>I love the extra brush head included.</li>
      <li>This is the first time that I have bought them from Amazon.</li>
      <li>Cool idea, but too soft.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s super soft.  </li>
      <li>I always use the large radius.</li>
      <li>The grip feels good and makes the brush easy to handle, but the plastic head hits my teeth in an uncomfortable way.</li>
      <li>and I really like the large bristle head.  </li>
      <li>This tooth brush is great....if you enjoy picking bristles out of your mouth every second while brushing your teeth and almost gagging in the process</li>
      <li>My gums feel much cleaner using these toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>Someone recommended these and they message your gums a much nicer brush.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know the firmness of the bristles they are used to before trying Radius, or if they got a defective batch of toothbrushes, but the soft bristles are just right.</li>
      <li>After reading the reviews here saying the soft bristles were much too soft, I ordered the medium bristle toothbrushes, thinking they would be like the soft bristles on the Radius Original, which I have been using for years.</li>
      <li>The bristles are quite soft (and I bought the &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34;).</li>
      <li>First time using this product and the medium bristles are really soft.</li>
      <li>They are the same as the ones on the Original Radius soft toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The toothbrush bristles are soft and the head is so large that it makes it easier to brush all areas of your mouth.</li>
      <li>Be advised that the &#x27;medium&#x27; bristles are pretty far on the &#x27;soft&#x27; side.</li>
      <li>They are adjustable for right or left hands.</li>
      <li>Those were too big and fit only in one position.  </li>
      <li>These handles are cool, especially the crushed money handle, but the brush heads are very very soft(the</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>I always really liked the big brush head on the other Radius toothbrush, but the handle never fit my hand right.</li>
      <li>I wonder just how soft the soft bristles are because the medium is very soft.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this toothbrush just to see if there would be a big difference, and so far I really like it.  </li>
      <li>medium feels like a soft and the soft feels like a feather)</li>
      <li>The bristles are way too soft.</li>
      <li>You can also change the brushes out from medium to soft as needed.</li>
      <li>The bristles are soft for a medium and feel like a \\&quot;soft\\&quot; toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>ordered soft Source replacement heads, and they aren&#x27;t too soft at all</li>
      <li>(like how soft reviewers described).</li>
      <li>The medium bristles are soft, so do get medium.  </li>
      <li>Some described the soft bristled tooth brush to be like brushing your teeth with a paint brush.</li>
      <li>For a &#x27;medium&#x27;, the bristles are a bit soft too.</li>
      <li>I love how it brushes my gums and tongue so easily due to the wide head.  </li>
      <li>The head is bigger than normal, but it sort of flays out and gets the gums as well.</li>

    <li> These handles are cool, especially the crushed money handle, but the brush heads are very very soft(the medium feels like a soft and the soft feels like a feather) and they don&#x27;t last very long.  The handle feels good in the hand.  Gave the money brush to my dad- he loves it!</li>
    <li> Gave this as a Christmas gift.  Everyone loves it.  Nice huge ergonomic handle and I really like the large bristle head.  It takes longer to wash out the extra toothpaste at the root of the bristles, but otherwise, great product.</li>
    <li> I love these!  I got the medium and it&#x27;s super soft.  I imagine the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; wouldn&#x27;t clean your teeth at all.  I&#x27;d avoid that.  I love how it brushes my gums and tongue so easily due to the wide head.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love the concept of these toothbrushes. The bristles are quite soft (and I bought the &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34;). I love that they&#x27;re made in the USA of recycled material. I love the extra brush head included. However, I must have brushed with the wrong angle one time, because the head snapped right off. The plastic was actually broken where it inserts into the handle. The handle was unusable. So I&#x27;m glad this came as a 3 - pack! If I don&#x27;t have that issue again, I can see myself continuing to purchase these.</li>
    <li> I love these handles. I have had one for about 6 years now. Bought these so I would have a different one to take on trips. They are adjustable for right or left hands.</li>
    <li> I like that these toothbrushes have disposable heads and can be set up for lefties like myself. The bristles, however, do not seem to last very long.</li>
    <li> Ohmygodthisisthebesttoothbrushever!!!! Have you ever experienced true happiness? Do you know what is like to walk on clouds or feel an ocean breeze against your face? This tooth brush makes life worth living. If you only had one possession, you would hope for this tooth brush. The feeling of its silky bristles against my teeth make my toes curl. It inspires me to floss (wait, floss? Yes! I actually WANT to floss) just so I get to use it. In fact, I may just go brush my teeth now because I&#x27;m talking about how great it is. You&#x27;ll be glad you got it.</li>
    <li> I love these tooth brushes. They have a lot of bristles and feels like its massaging your gums. I have been buying these for bout 5 years now. This is the first time that I have bought them from Amazon. Great deal too!</li>
    <li> Someone recommended these and they message your gums a much nicer brush. I bought for. My Autistic son too and he seems to like brushing his teeth more with theses win win!! Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> This tooth brush is great....if you enjoy picking bristles out of your mouth every second while brushing your teeth and almost gagging in the process</li>
    <li> I love this! Cleans well and medium is just right! Love the way it looks too. I bought the three pack and gave away two of them to my mom and sister; they love them too.</li>
    <li> Works great. I like the larger brush area on these. You can also change the brushes out from medium to soft as needed.</li>
    <li> The bristles are way too soft.</li>
    <li> I purchased this toothbrush just to see if there would be a big difference, and so far I really like it.  The bristles are soft for a medium and feel like a \\&quot;soft\\&quot; toothbrush.  The size is also comfortable and makes you feel like your getting a better clean.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these three packs of toothbrushes.  Each order had 2 paper material handles, not even shown on the picture or written about and one of money handle.  There were no tooth brushes made out of Wood or Flax.  I expected a variety of three types.  Now I am stuck with 2 recycled money and 4 all recycled paper.  Not enough variety for a family.  I went out last night and bought a wooden one at the health store. So I didn&#x27;t save money by buying them here on amazon.  A better description saying that they will all be the same material would have been more accurate.  The toothbrushes do work well though when brushing your teeth.  The medium bristles are soft, so do get medium.  I wonder just how soft the soft bristles are because the medium is very soft.  It does clean well though.  Your mouth feels fresh and no plaque on the teeth, so that&#x27;s the important thing here.  We&#x27;ve been using sonic electric and it&#x27;s been losing crowns and hurting our teeth, so I wanted something that works but safer product.  Radius does clean as well as an expensive electric system.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed to discover that their &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; is softer than the original style&#x27;s &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush.  The toothbrush bristles are soft and the head is so large that it makes it easier to brush all areas of your mouth. The larger handle makes it easier to grasp and navigate.  The recycled materials are a bonus for our environment.</li>
    <li> Comfortable, sustainable, recyclable, affordable ... and all brushes come with a replacement head. It&#x27;s hard to beat this beauty of a brush.</li>
    <li> Here in the foothills of Upstate NY, tooth brushing seems to be out of favor. Never one to buck a trend, I was about to give up brushing and let my teeth rot out of my head. But along came the Radius Source Recycled Handle Toothbrush, Medium, Assorted Colors (3 count)… and I was reconverted to modern dental hygiene! Heck, I might even start bathing on a seasonal basis.</li>
    <li> Cool idea, but too soft.  After a week I felt like the head needed replacing.</li>
    <li> WOW! My mouth feels so clean after using this. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever go back to another brush. The head is bigger than normal, but it sort of flays out and gets the gums as well. LOVE that feeling. Made in the USA from recycled materials, vegan, eco-friendly. What else more could you want in a toothbrush!? :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 1/25/16: I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 2 years now. I still have the original handle and just switch out the heads. Everyone in my house uses one now and we all swear we will never go back to wimpy, skinny toothbrushes again.</li>
    <li> I got one of these toothbrushes as a gift and have since bought about ten more for my family and friends! They are awesome because you can just replace the heads instead of an entirely new brush! And the recycled handles is pretty cool!!!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews here saying the soft bristles were much too soft, I ordered the medium bristle toothbrushes, thinking they would be like the soft bristles on the Radius Original, which I have been using for years. I prefer the tapered head and handle on this toothbrush (Raduis Source) over the Original one. The medium bristles weren&#x27;t for me, I&#x27;m an aggressive tooth brusher and after 2 weeks, it damaged my gums.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered soft Source replacement heads, and they aren&#x27;t too soft at all (like how soft reviewers described). Some described the soft bristled tooth brush to be like brushing your teeth with a paint brush. Ha! I don&#x27;t know the firmness of the bristles they are used to before trying Radius, or if they got a defective batch of toothbrushes, but the soft bristles are just right. They are the same as the ones on the Original Radius soft toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this product 5 stars because if I hadn&#x27;t followed some of the reviews and ordered the soft bristled toothbrushes instead of the medium I would have been 100% happy with this product.</li>
    <li> after reading a few reviews saying that medium feels soft, I decided to go with medium - but those reviews were wrong medium is not soft enough.</li>
    <li> works great, feels great- My gums feel much cleaner using these toothbrushes. Of course the eco features are great, too.</li>
    <li> The grip feels good and makes the brush easy to handle, but the plastic head hits my teeth in an uncomfortable way. For a &#x27;medium&#x27;, the bristles are a bit soft too.</li>
    <li> First time using this product and the medium bristles are really soft. I like that&#x27;s wider than your typical toothbrush but because I apply a lot of force on the handle and the head, the head has broken twice. Uncertain how to remove the part that&#x27;s left so I can reuse the handle. Guess it&#x27;s back to another toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Far better than the original radius with the left and right hand toothbrushes.  Those were too big and fit only in one position.  The Radius recycled toothbrush have smaller head and thinner handles so you can get to all parts of your mouth.  Also, I got the medium bristle but it was nice and soft and felt good (no poking into gums like some).</li>
    <li> I always really liked the big brush head on the other Radius toothbrush, but the handle never fit my hand right. This one has the same solid, substantial presence in the hand but less of the fussy contours that make the other one feel &#x27;off&#x27; about half the time. Be advised that the &#x27;medium&#x27; bristles are pretty far on the &#x27;soft&#x27; side.</li>
    <li> I always use the large radius. thought I would try the smaller one. Recycled handle is no problem, feels like a regular handle.</li>
    <li> HUGE head on these gems. I also love the ergonomic handle design. A really really great toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Great product and non-toxic!</li>
    <li> My husband and I have both switched to this toothbrush. The larger head took a few uses to get used to, but now I can&#x27;t imagine using a smaller toothbrush head. It definitely seems to do a better job cleaning our teeth. Will be buying replacement heads in the future.</li>
