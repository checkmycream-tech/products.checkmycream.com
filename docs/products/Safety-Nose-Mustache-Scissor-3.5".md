    <li> Good product. Great Deal.</li>
    <li> Great inexpensive set!</li>
    <li> had an old pair of these for years and lost them...perfect match.</li>
    <li> Use this for my mustache and sideburns. I really like how it has rounded safety ends so I don&#x27;t have to worry about accidentally injuring myself when trimming up.  Works good. Shipped and arrived fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> Really great pair of trimmers. They are really sharp and so is the cut. They arrived fast after purchasing. I like them. They are handy. I trim my mustache with mine. They do the job. Not too much to say about them. So I would purchase them again.</li>
    <li> safety scissor should have rounded edges...mine didn&#x27;t and i cut my ear</li>
    <li> I use the scissors to trim face of my dog. Works well</li>
    <li> Wonderful high quality scissors!</li>
    <li> OW!  I just cut the inside of my nose.  They aren&#x27;t safe.  Like another user, I think &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34; scissors should have BLUNT tips.  Am looking for another pair and I will relegate this to the toolbox where they belong.</li>
    <li> just what I wanted and seems to be good quality</li>
    <li> The scissors arrived on time and work great.</li>

    <li> I like the size and the price, but wish they didn&#x27;t stick when I use them. Otherwise, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> They are a little tight on my fingers.</li>
