<li> Just don&#x27;t rub it in too long.</li>
<li> It also has a slight tint to it so you can use it as a foundation, if you want, but I usually put this on first and then put my foundation on afterwards.</li>
<li> Kind of disappointed, was hoping it wouldn&#x27;t be to chalky looking.  </li>
<li> With the slight tint, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with a ashy tone or white caste.</li>
<li> The tint in the sunscreen after applying foundation makes my face look a little red.</li>
<li> so really, it is not noncomedogenic.</li>
<li> I have tried other products and none compare to this one for me.</li>
<li> and this brand is less expensive than some of the others that my dermatologist and esthetician have recommended.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and was as advertised.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this moisturizer after my esthetician gave me some samples to try at home.  I have oily, acne prone skin so I don&#x27;t wear liquid makeup, only a fuller coverage powder.  This tinted moisturizer provides a little more even tone to my skin without the heaviness of liquid makeup.  It&#x27;s light and feels great going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also nice that this is suitable for sensitive skin and I can use this right after a chemical peel or laser BBL treatment with no burning or irritation.  Elta MD products in general are a no-brainer.  Everything I&#x27;ve tried is fantastic so far and this brand is less expensive than some of the others that my dermatologist and esthetician have recommended.</li>
    <li> Kind of disappointed, was hoping it wouldn&#x27;t be to chalky looking.  It is.</li>
    <li> A really nice product. It doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin red or break out. The tint in it is a nice alternative to foundation or a BB cream for summer months.</li>
    <li> Excellent sunscreen. All mineral and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores</li>
    <li> Greatest skin product from a great company.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for quite a few years now and find it excellent</li>
    <li> Warning- this has dimethicone in it. Dimethicone suffocates your skin- it doesn&#x27;t allow it to breathe. It will actually cause aging of the skin. Do some research.</li>
    <li> This is the first sunblock out of a plethora that I&#x27;ve tried over the past 20 years that does NOT irritate my eyes to the point of stinging, burning and watering. It goes on smoothly and easily and the light tint makes a very nice cover on my skin.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend......love this product!   It is not greasy, goes on easily, and has a slight tint that looks natural on your skin!</li>
    <li> Love this product. It replaces any need for foundation. A good neutral color. Moist but not greasy. Good sun protection.</li>
    <li> This spf is great !  It really does the job right.  Tinted just right, at least for me.  I use it every day.</li>
    <li> goes on smoothly, actually covers up blemishes while providing UV protection.</li>
    <li> Love this product, Love the entire line of EltaMd</li>
    <li> Love this spf, finaly something that doesnt irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing! If your skin is dry put moisturizer first let sit and then apply spf.&lt;br /&gt;Color is amazing too, not pink not yellow not orange just perfect nude.&lt;br /&gt;definitely will repurchase when i am done with this tube.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Physically blocks uv rays and has a light tint. Recommended by my derm but cheaper here. Amazon apparently has a minimum word count</li>
    <li> my dermatologist suggested this product. I got a free sample and had to have it right away! The tint is light like a foundation and it covers slight imperfections and it does not irritate my very sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly and matches skin tone.</li>
    <li> Recommended by the derm and I love it.  Goes on light and absorbs well.  No smell and no greasy feeling either.</li>
    <li> Very great coverage and feels nice on my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product and would not be without it in the Texas sun. I have tried other products and none compare to this one for me.</li>
    <li> Recommended by a dermatologist.  The tinted product is great because you do not have to wear makeup if you are exercising or running errands.</li>
    <li> I like it very much. It was deliveried in time</li>
    <li> Love this sun screen.  My dermatologist sold me my first tube and I&#x27;ve been hook ever since.  It works great and I&#x27;m not getting the age spots on my face anymore from the sun as long as I continue to use this.  It also has a slight tint to it so you can use it as a foundation, if you want, but I usually put this on first and then put my foundation on afterwards.</li>
    <li> This cream is Great except I was also hoping for a moisturizer included as well. Great product though . .</li>
    <li> This is great stuff, and it serves as a foundation or make up, too.</li>
    <li> Great, high quality SPF. I bought this after I began using Retin A and my dermatologist recommended a mineral  based sunscreen with at lease 9% Zinc Oxide. This product fits the bill perfectly. Non greasy and rubs in easily. With the slight tint, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with a ashy tone or white caste.</li>
    <li> Nice shade for fair coverage.</li>
    <li> I have cystic acne and my skin loves it! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT...DOESN&#x27;T CAUSE BREAKOUTS</li>
    <li> Great sunblock.  I love this product and will be buying it again.  The product is thicker and last a long time.</li>
    <li> Light and lovely. Tint allows you to go without foundation.</li>
    <li> This is a magnificent product. Coverage is sheer and I use it every time I&#x27;m out. Most recently, I used it every day during my vacation in Easter Island. It made a huge difference as it totally protected my face from burning.</li>
    <li> Very good sunscreen on the face. The tint in the sunscreen after applying foundation makes my face look a little red. Other than that, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen. It is tinted and allows one to apply it easily. Just don&#x27;t rub it in too long. Will start pilling. Very effective. Will buy again from this vendor.</li>
    <li> An excellent sunscreen - way better than the other tinted physical sunscreen I was using from a leading skincare brand. This sunscreen has a soft souffle like texture, goes on easy and looks like high quality foundation. That it is a great base for your blush is an added bonus (I don&#x27;t wear foundation). This is now my daily sunscreen!</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen as not greasy.</li>
    <li> Caused me to breakout</li>
    <li> Love this line never clogs my pores</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best! I use it every day as a sunblock and foundation.  It goes on smooth and does not cake up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to certain chemicals in regular sunscreen so have to use a physical blocker. I really like the tint of this one because it doesn&#x27;t leave me looking chalky white like many others do.

    <li> Fabulous stuff makes my wife even more beautiful than she naturally is. It works magnificently and comes very promptly and dependably. Thank you for a fine product and excellent service.</li>
    <li> I have used this sunscreen for several years based upon my dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation.</li>
    <li> Has an acne clogging ingredient. so really, it is not noncomedogenic. Broke me out. Probably good for the body, bit not for the face.</li>
