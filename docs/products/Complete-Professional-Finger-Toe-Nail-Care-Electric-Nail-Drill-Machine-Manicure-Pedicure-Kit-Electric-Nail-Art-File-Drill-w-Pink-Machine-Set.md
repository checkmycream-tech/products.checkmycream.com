      <li>But it does work and for the most part get the job done.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Awesome starter for a manicurist beginning to use an electric drill! Extremely happy with my purchase. So glad I didn&#x27;t spend the extra $100 for a different drill!</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t really use it yet because I haven&#x27;t received all my products but this came with everything the description said. I used it on my nails to see how it works and if It would turn on and it did. the noise is very low well if you turn the speed up than it will be louder. the blades are smaller than the picture but if your doing nails from home and starting up a business this is perfect.</li>
    <li> So Far it&#x27;s good, the packaging was a mess but everything was in it and the machine works good, and I guess that&#x27;s the important thing, right ;)</li>
    <li> Love this. Just what I was wanting</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m into doing nails at my own home and have gotten everything I needed except for a drill. I looked at this product and read the reviews and instantly wanted to buy it. I received my package yesterday afternoon, which was early 😇 and started using it right away. And may I say this drill is AMAZING. You can easily adjust the bits and the speed to which fits best and the bits fit right in place compared to other handheld nail drills. Definitely worth the price and it came with everything the picture showed. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who is interested in doing their own nails at home.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product..well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Thank you soo much! It&#x27;s work and well fit!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d buy it again if I ever need to!</li>
    <li> We Love This!!! It has a speed control from very low to Very high. Has more power then you will need. There is so many bits to pick from no matter what you need to do. There are lots of emery board rounds.I like that there is a holder for the hand held part. The cords are long. I like everything about this set!!!!</li>
    <li> Works just like the professionals. Come with a lot of attachments and files. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Excellent seller</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and much more powerful than I anticipated. I like that I am able to adjust the speed/power. There are a lot of extras. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> The power is what I needed.</li>
    <li> Great product, works great for acrylics.</li>
    <li> This product is 110 only! Wrong product details! I only notice this  after sending Itoversea to my mother as a gift. That&#x27;s very bad information. Lost money!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and worked perfectly!</li>
    <li> Drill works great everything was neat and tight no spills, but the fill block was cheap and didn&#x27;t last long. So 4 stars great for the price 😀</li>
    <li> love this!!! use it all the time. nails come out just like i went to the shop. i would buy it again.</li>
    <li> My first time using one of these machines. I&#x27;m using it because I began to experience a toe nail fungus on one of my toe nails after been careless at the gym. I used this machine to file down the nail that was getting thick and added toe nail fungus solution to take care of the problem. The machine was really easy to use and I was overwhelmed with all of the little pieces that it comes with. I wish it was in a different color, but the machine works just like its supposed to.</li>
    <li> cheap price and excellent..</li>
    <li> Good product but it seems like each time I use it the motor was to give out. I would get a better quality one instead of this one. But its ok.</li>
    <li> I like the tool and provides everything you need, but be sure to know what you are doing so you don&#x27;t thin out your nails - I accidentally did it on my right pinky and it took months to grow back after it ripped off like paper- my bad.</li>
    <li> This Professional finger toe nail care electric nail drill is exactly what I have been looking for.  It is very easy to use and has so many great attachments.  I&#x27;ve been able to do my own manicures and pedicures with great success.  Once again Amazon has come to the rescue.</li>
    <li> I use this to trim my nails before getting them done at salon and it works perfect. Great purchase! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this nail grinder to do my own gel nails at home &amp; it works great!!! Having the grinding tool separate from the main power controller allows to have a smaller, easier to handle tool , capabale of very detailed work.. this set has an incredible number of grinding bits the diff replaceable sandpaper grits as well as the many permenant diamond bits... I use the small round head diamond bits, with the  power turned down low to trim my cuticles.. this works better than anything I have ever done for them, they look great!!!  Love this little machine..  Now here is the bonus!!! I own the Conair pet nail grinder for my French Bulldog.. but it is larger, heavyer &amp; difficult to manipulate arround her nails that are thick &amp; curl back very quickly..  I started using this nail drill on my bulldogs nails, it works so much better!!!  It&#x27;s even quieter than the conair, I have just been improvising, making different versions of paw/toe guards that expose one nail at a time... (Sort ofike those &amp;#34;no chew&amp;#34; collars you get at the vets) .. so this has become my tool of choose for both my bulldog &amp; myself!!!!</li>
    <li> I had originally brought a drill from Sally&#x27;s for $105 and it died on me after doing a pedi for my husband! So I purchased this drill just to get me by. Well let me tell you honey this baby is better than the one I had before. I do my own acrylic nails and this baby does the trick. I did my toes and nails and they came out salon quality. Will purchase again for a gift.</li>
    <li> I love this!  I did my feet, and they look fantastic now!  Belive me, I couldn&#x27;t think anything could help, but this professional package is amazing.  Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> As soon as I got this 8Decades Complete Professional Finger Toe Nail Electric Nail Drill I tried it to remove my artificial nails n wow! it worked good great. I would recommend it highly to anyone that wants to order it.</li>
    <li> Came with everything it said it would.&lt;br /&gt;I love it just don&#x27;t get to excited when you first start. Lol</li>
    <li> I had a review already on this nail drill, but Amazon deleted it!  Anyway, I three-starred it before because here&#x27;s how it all went:  I ordered this in May, got free shipping, got it in just 2 days, good packaging, then the nail drill motor was defective.  And even though the refund From Amazon was just 2 days, that doesn&#x27;t matter because Whoever your bank is, is gonna take the better part of a week.  It was fortunate that I was going to be at a mail place in a 1 or 2 days, so the return process and refund, again from Amazon went smooth &amp; fast.  Ok, I finally get credit from my bank, it was probably more than a week since you can&#x27;t count the weekend days and keep in mind, I was really needing a manicure since I Have to wear acrylics and already had had to fix several nails, so very justifiably irate at that point.  Now, this part is Amazon&#x27;s - they need to reprogram the &#x27;One Click&#x27; feature to where it verifies free shipping options, coupons, etc. Sooo, not only did I have to spend more than $5 more This time on a repurchase, it was Not delivered in a timely fashion - not compared to 2 days.  It took 3x longer, about a week. To sum up this part of the review:  Everything first time around was great until I found out the bloody thing didn&#x27;t work, credit &amp; return smooth, but not valid since bank will Always take Much longer, Finally repurchase, end up spending more in time and money.&lt;br /&gt;Whew!  Ok, now the product itself?  It is Great!  Oh, the packaging 2nd time, all good, everything you see, you get.  I have now used it a couple of times along with my daughter and she likes it too.  The motor, of course, 1st thing checked, all good, light came on and everything.  I like the nail drill itself - I was even able to attach some drill heads from a cheapo drill!  That helped.  It&#x27;s very easy to interchange the head, just pull it out!  It Is quiet, yet Very powerful; I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever need to go higher on dial than little past half way - unless I&#x27;m sanding some woodlol  On a lighter con side, I don&#x27;t care for pink at all and it woulda been nice if they made a handle for the box it came in so you could also use it as a carrying case.  All in all, from what I, what I went through, I give 3 1/2 stars. I would have given 5.</li>
    <li> If you like doing your own nails instead of having them done with salon tools that are not always steriolize I would recommend this to you.</li>
    <li> love this tool, it has been wonderful and has helped me a lot. Cant live with out it. I recommend it fully.</li>
    <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve been using it for days and it is really cool! I&#x27;ve only just started doing my own acrylics but this is very easy to use and comes with so much stuff!</li>
    <li> This drill is a LIFESAVER.  I love it.  It was really affordable, especially compared to other drills which can cost up to three to four times as much, with comparable quality.  It arrived quickly and as advertised.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Getting the job done!!!</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase.  The price was fantastic for all of the stuff it came with.</li>
    <li> It was well packaged and included every part I have not used it yet but looks like good quality</li>
    <li> this thing caught fire its 48 days out of warranty.. be careful people.</li>
    <li> Love it.  I feel like a professional.</li>
    <li> The drill has a shortage in it and it&#x27;s very difficult to get it to work properly. I&#x27;m skeptical about getting anything else from amazon because there is always a problem.</li>
    <li> Love this drill! You can set the drill for any speed or reverse the polarity so that the bit will spin either way. Comes with pretty much everything you&#x27;d need for a professional manicure. It was even robust enough to shape gels and I&#x27;m sure it would also do well with acrylics.</li>
    <li> This drill was well worth the money. Almost went with the 10.00 one but in glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Love it. Would recommend this&lt;br /&gt;Product to anyone. Good for budgeting individuals. Comes in handy when first starting off</li>
    <li> Came with a lot of extras. It deff gets the job done</li>
    <li> This is probably one of the nicest devices I have owned in a long time. Thanks for the fast delivery and awesome machine..</li>
    <li> Comes with everything in picture. Came on time and absolutely love this drill. Definitely a good drill for starters to start out with.</li>
    <li> Im happy that now I can do my pedicures in the comfort of my own home...also I can remove my acrylic nails without all the mess that comes with just soaking them...great product...works just like the nail shop</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this drill !!! Issues with the coiled chord, issues with it coming unplugged from motor because the cord isn&#x27;t long enough. Also has quite a bit of vibration that&#x27;s not so comfortable for clients. Guess you get what you pay for !!</li>
    <li> Very good with no helpful instructions for the novice but with some common sense you can pick out most of the many tool tips that you need and comes with it.</li>
    <li> Just as described, thank you!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for is the best thing I can say. The additional bits really aren&#x27;t that useful because of the quality. The drill has a high vibration so you can definitely feel it in your hands after you stop using it. I will more than likely by a better quality one when I have the funds to do so and keep this one as a backup. But it does work and for the most part get the job done.</li>
    <li> Well worth it thank u !!!!</li>
    <li> I love it!!!!!  Saved me so much time on doing my nails. The controls are easy to use, and everything you need comes with. Great deal</li>
    <li> Absolutely luv it , couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
    <li> If you are looking for quality at a great price, this is the product to order. I love my new home kit and the fact that it will save me endless $$$ in the salon is a bonus!!!</li>
    <li> First I just want to say this is a review from a manicurist so it&#x27;s a very professional view. And I&#x27;m not trying to compare this to a $300 medicool or kupa drill i&#x27;m just comparing with basic requirements of a nail drill.&lt;br /&gt;The item is well packed and delivered on time but made with cheap plastic, All the tools included are crap (the bit is very important it has to be super straight and good quality so you don&#x27;t feel any vibration on the nail and the diameter has to be perfect so you can easy to put on and take off the sand paper ring).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s ok to use on regular nails and toes at less than 5000 RPM but you still can feel a slight vibration so if you &#x27;r a sensitive person it will be uncomfortable. Anything more than 5000+ RPM is unacceptable with vibration and heat (only 10 minutes of use)&lt;br /&gt;Stay away if you plan to use it as a backup drill for professional don&#x27;t waste your money even if it&#x27;s only $20+ it&#x27;s not worth the return. You can use it on regular nail at low speed but then there are better and smaller options for that at cheaper price so this is a NO also.</li>
    <li> Fantastic. It was the perfect gift and much appreciated.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best price for an electric drill! It is very quiet and easy to work with either if your right handed or left. It is also very powerful, also I loved the extra things it gives you. The glitter, buffer and stickers.are awesome. I loved the whole package. It was well worth the almost 30ish 40 bucks! :)</li>
    <li> I am in school to be a nail tech. and this was a great, first drill! It works great, super light and you can&#x27;t beat the price for all you get!  I did notice that after working on a few hands back-to-back, it started to bog down slightly w/pressure.  However, if you are looking for a drill for personal use or to use on very few clients, this one is perfect!</li>
    <li> Received this in no time. And so far I like it.</li>
    <li> This filler works pretty good ... It&#x27;s on the small side but it gets the job done ... I really recommend it ... I have absolutely no regrets on purchasing this item ...</li>
    <li> Works great. I use at home for everything,  acrylic nails, toenails and fingernails.</li>
    <li> This is great for filing acrylic nails. My only problem with it is that when it gets over heated it stops working. You have to let it sit for a few minutes before it will work again.</li>
    <li> Kinda rinky-dink. Full is stuff I don&#x27;t need - just wanted the grinding tool for a recurring callouse...I did get it, and it does work.</li>
    <li> The Toe Nail care electric nail drill is fine but i finding difficult to understand the bits due that those not have a complete guide to use the small tools. (Bits)</li>
    <li> Totally awesome kit! Now I can do my own nails from home instead of paying money every two weeks for the upkeep, I can just do them myself. Love the drill, it works great and everything else along with it! It came faster than expected and I would definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Great gift for my wife</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this nail drill. have had high-end drills that haven&#x27;t even worked this well. 5 stars no doubt about it. Highly recommend for girls in nail school, easy way to trim down nails. Will definitely talk about this!</li>
    <li> This item works perfectly! I was so excited to get it and did a full set of UV gel nails that same day! Now all i have to do is research how to use all the other pieces! Lol</li>
    <li> I had purchased another drill from Sally&#x27;s before purchasing this one but found that the Sally&#x27;s drill was way too powerful. I kept burning myself and figured there had to be another drill that would better fit my needs. After reading the reviews on this file, I decided that this would be one to try and I&#x27;m so glad I made the purchase. It fits my hands perfectly. The option to change the speed of the drill takes the convenience level of this product to 100%. The attachments are a great and useful addition, along with all the extras. The price for this drill could not be better. It&#x27;s a quality drill and I would recommend it to anyone, whether a beginner or professional.</li>
    <li> Very please no need to ever go to a nail shop will save a lot to time and money to come</li>
    <li> I love how smooth it files and sands the nails!</li>
    <li> Really good to work with for starters. 😊</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife, who is attending cosmology school. She was looking for something to practice with, so we got this one. And she fell in love with it. She has access to higher end equipment at school and says this does a pretty good job of keeping up.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical when I first opened up the box since it was labeled Mercedes 2000.  I was expecting to see the brand 8Decades since that was in the item description.  Any how, I used it twice so far on removing my gel nail polish and it works to my satisfaction.  I like having it spin both ways and the adjustable speed.  It came with a lot of sanding bands.  Some of them are too loose and slide off while using the drill.  Some are very tight and are difficult to pull off the drill bit.  Not a huge deal, still a useful drill for my purpose at a reasonable price.  I have only used it for sanding down the gel polish, I cannot comment on all the other drill bits that are included.</li>
    <li> I did have a problem with the machine, but the seller quickly replaced the item and I have not had another problem. It does the job for what I use it for.</li>
    <li> GREAT PURCHASE !!! I LOVE THIS THING!!</li>
    <li> Item received on time,  exactly as was described and I am satisfied with the performance, I recommend it to any one.</li>
    <li> Was broken when I received it.</li>
    <li> This tool comes with a lot of great extras but the machine started to smoke after using it for five minutes! It wasn&#x27;t even on high. I immediately returned it.</li>
    <li> way better than i expected! and way cheaper than buying through a supply store.  Perfect for what I need it for!</li>
