      <li>Yes, you get a good color and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  </li>

      <li>I’ve been using self-tanners for 30 years or so, and Banana Boat is the best for the price for a semi-immediate tan, plus a nice medium-term tan that blends nicely and last</li>

      <li>, she was impressed how natural it looked.  </li>

      <li>(i have very light skin).  </li>
      <li>and after pictures so i could see the results better</li>

      <li>Thank god I had used it a week before the wedding so that most of the rust coloring was gone after 7 days.</li>
      <li>love it.  </li>
      <li>I just started using - it seems OK</li>
      <li>so although works i will stick with Jergens :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not terrible like Neurogena ones</li>
      <li>My parents even commented that I looked healthy with a tan.</li>
      <li>I have used this brand for years and love it.</li>
      <li>OK</li>
      <li>That has worked out better.</li>
      <li>and she said that I was more tan than she would like to see.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>It goes on well and looks pretty good.</li>
      <li>It provides a nice bronze immediately after application, which helps ensure you get full coverage.  </li>
      <li>great color  very natural - would recommend to any one - I use it every two days</li>
      <li>This version gives a nice golden glow.....</li>
      <li>no blotches, easy application.  </li>
      <li>It gave me a very nice natural bronze color, is streak free and no unpleasant odor.</li>
      <li>Start with the light tan.</li>
      <li>light skinned ones...</li>
      <li>so i just go lightly on those areas.</li>
      <li>I tried it and it is fantastic.</li>
      <li>The light/medium gives a nice color without too much.  </li>
      <li>I have a light skin color and this matched well.</li>
      <li>found it on walmart.com for$5.97 and free home shipping.</li>

      <li>I love this stuff it makes me looks so pretty tan and not an orange tan</li>
      <li>It works great looks natural and doesn&#x27;t really streak.</li>
      <li>The color is not overwhelming (a beautiful golden brown), and the directions were very easy to follow.</li>
      <li>She looks beautifully tan with no smear or smudge marks like other products.</li>
      <li>However if the smell does not bother you this is an overall good product.</li>
      <li>Just glad I found a steady supply through Amazon.</li>

      <li>and I love the natural tan I get.</li>
      <li>Ok, so I figured it was my toes, old skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few sunless tanners over the years and this is BY FAR the best.  </li>
      <li>Works pretty quick</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a ex redhead with fair skin and all the other products make me look&lt;</li>
      <li>Summer Color Light/Medium  looks very natural,  easy to apply with no streaks.</li>
      <li>sure why anyone would spend more on other fancy schmancy brands at higher prices?</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My go-to fake n bake times 7 years now ... I put a dollop of this and my body butter and spread on my legs every morning after my shower.  Everyone wonders when I have time to get my great tan.  (I&#x27;m not telling!)</li>
    <li> I am an extremely pale person, and just bought this to give myself some color without burning in the sun. The color is not overwhelming (a beautiful golden brown), and the directions were very easy to follow. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Of the many self-tanners I&#x27;ve purchased, this is the only one that produces a nice even brown tone (not orange) and, best of all, has a pleasant smell. Great product, great results, great price!</li>
    <li> I am light/medium olive skin tone and this product works really well for me. Not orange at all but nice color. I haven&#x27;t found this product to streak at all and I would say I am very picky about this since I work as actress and model in front of the camera. It&#x27;s a great price. The smell is average for a self tanner. I never like how they smell. It&#x27;s not terrible like Neurogena ones but I would say it&#x27;s so-so. The only slightly negative thing I have found with this product is that it is slightly tinted (so you can see where you have applied) and that color will rub off on white things like sheets or clothes if you don&#x27;t shower afterwards. But I haven&#x27;t found it to be a big deal. Overall this is a really good product at a great price and gives you nice color that isn&#x27;t streaky or orange....at least on my coloring type.</li>
    <li> Banana Boat is one of my all time favorite self tanning products.  It produces a natural looking tan.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and it doesn&#x27;t have the awful smell that most self tanners have.  I absolutely would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like this product...its self adjusting i actual wish i took before and after pictures so i could see the results better but overall i like the results&lt;br /&gt;1) take a shower and scrub first then put it on.&lt;br /&gt;2) when putting on get a good amount and rub it between both hands then apply it with both hands that way its not \\&quot;streaky\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i dont understand how it streaks..i couldnt if i tried but skin types are different so maybe thats why some people streak... im already naturally tan but i like to add a little more color :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pretty good but i prefer Jergens brand lotions so although works i will stick with Jergens :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it smells kinda peachy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of summers now and haven&#x27;t had any issues.  It looks very natural.  In fact, I had an appt with a Dermatologist for a skin cancer screening and she said that I was more tan than she would like to see.  When I told her it was a self-tanner, she was impressed how natural it looked.  The only downside is that it has a stronger smell.</li>
    <li> The front of the tube says \\&quot;For a Natural Looking Tan\\&quot;.  That&#x27;s only true if you natural color is orange.  It also says \\&quot;Streak Free\\&quot;.  Not true.</li>
    <li> I was going to a wedding and needed a little &#x27;healthy color&#x27;. I bought this off of a recommendation from a friend, so I figured it would be good. Quite the opposite, it was awful. The first application turned the skin on my toe knuckles orange. Ok, so I figured it was my toes, old skin, just don&#x27;t apply it on my toes. So I used it a second time and skipped my toes. The third day, I noticed that my palms of my hands were dark rust-orange...that lasted for a 3-4 days. About 5 days after the second application, the skin between my fingers turned rust colored while the rest was white, and I looked like a freak. Thank god I had used it a week before the wedding so that most of the rust coloring was gone after 7 days. I am fair, but tan nicely. I used the Jergens product and had great results. I would definitely NOT recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this brand for years and love it. I use it 3 or 4 times a week and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad. I have referred it to many of my friends. I use it at night when wearing old clothes because it will stain.</li>
    <li> I have very pale, white skin and even during the summer months I can never seem to keep a tan- Plus, I am concerned about staying out of the sun, so I was looking for an alternative to tanning. I have used gradual tanning products before, but I never felt like it got to a point where I really noticed. With this product, though, I saw great results within hours! I even did another coat the next day and I am still very happy with the results! I did not notice any streaks nor do I feel like I am orange. This will be a product I use for a long time!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product every summer for the last 3 years and I love the natural tan I get. I don&#x27;t like the smell and the brown color rubs off onto clothes so I put it on at night and shower it off in the morning but the tan remains. I reapply every other day or as needed. I have never noticed any streaking and I recommend this product for a great sunless tan!</li>
    <li> Go to Wally world there is no need to pay 2 times the price of something!!! I paid 6.47!!! And why would they sell this product used?? Ripping people off ain&#x27;t the way to make a quick buck. Good day!</li>
    <li> I have found this product works well, but you have to use it according to the directions. That means applying it daily until you get the color you want. Then to maintain the color, you can get by with two applications a week.  When you first apply it, most of the color will wash off after you shower. Give it time. After applying it daily for a week you will notice a light to medium tan depending on your skin tone. It leaves your skin feeling moisturized too.</li>
    <li> I have used this one time and scrubbed very well before doing so with some sugar scrub and I turned as oranage as orange gets. And it was streaky too. I am pretty ghostly, so maybe that has something to do with it, but I think for now I will have to stick with the gradual tanners.</li>
    <li> Im happy with this product&lt;br /&gt;Cuz it gives me the color i want&lt;br /&gt;And it stays for several days&lt;br /&gt;I loved it</li>
    <li> I decided to try this tanning lotion based on the good reviews it received, and it delivers a beautiful not streaky, non-orange tan, but it smells! I dont know if i am super sensitive to smell or what, but after showering I still feel like i wreak of that musky sunless-tanner lotion-y smell. ew! However if the smell does not bother you this is an overall good product. It was easy to apply, i used gloves and was careful to blend it around my toes, ankles, knees, elbows and around my face and hairline. It dried in a matter of minutes and in a couple of hours I was definitely a few shades darker. (i have very light skin).  Now to find one that delivers these great results without the smell!</li>
    <li> Banana Boat makes the best tanning rub on product.  Start with the light tan. You can add more as time goes on, but it looks natural if properly applied.</li>
    <li> I have good results with the medium color. It goes on well and looks pretty good.</li>
    <li> I have tried countless self-tanners on my pale skin. This tanner by far is the most natural and has minimal smell. It gives a nice bronze color and I reach a perfect shade in only two applications.</li>
    <li> My shipment came with a number of tubes of this stuff, and I&#x27;m having a hard time justifying using even one to completion.  First of all, it took a while for the color to develop.  Once it did, it was patchy and unnatural-looking, even when I&#x27;d made sure to exfoliate and apply the product as evenly as possible.  Eventually, I gave up.  I&#x27;d rather walk around with pale legs than walk around with legs that&#x27;ve endured an uneven and weird tan job.</li>
    <li> great color  very natural - would recommend to any one - I use it every two days - Haven&#x27;t had anything come off on my clothes</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s great for summer.</li>
    <li> I am fair-to-medium, and a little ruddy.  I go straight to burn-and-peel, so I have to load up on the SPF. This is the best self-tanner I have found.  It looks natural and TAN, as in light brown, not orange-y.  It doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
    <li> I am fair complexioned and it seems I usually see dark lotion every where. Those look phoney on my skin, but this light/medium lotion gives a nice looking tan without turning dark spots extra dark or making my skin look orange. Twice a week is sufficient for keeping the tan looking nice. There is an odor, but it&#x27;s not overbearing.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I apply it after showering.  Goes on smoothy. Skin feels soft.  In a few hours I have a beautiful golden tan.  Looks very material.  No odor like some products.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t turn orange!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell weird!&lt;br /&gt;Nice color that developed quickly!&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had found Banana Boat a long time ago.</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve tried dozens.  It doesn&#x27;t leave you with that fake orange look nor does it have that smell most have.</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for at least 8 years. i am a red head and dont go in the sun. it does not turn me orange at all. love it.  found it on walmart.com for$5.97 and free home shipping. just ordered it after seeing the prices on here.</li>
    <li> Works pretty quick and I can&#x27;t find anything wrong with the stuff. It&#x27;s bettter than all the others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;Wash your hands quick or your palms will be tanned.</li>
    <li> I picked this up at Walmart and it is awesome! Not streakey or orange!!! I&#x27;m a brunette but my skin does not tan well and this works great! I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I used this before my cruise. I have a light skin color and this matched well. I found that is turns a nice brownish color with no orange. Like any tanner, you can get gaps if you do not apply evenly.</li>
    <li> Best self-tanner that i have tried by far!!  I would recommend giving it a try!  It&#x27;s hard to find on the shelf in my area...so getting it on prime is a great option for me.  Reasonably priced.  Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I’ve been using self-tanners for 30 years or so, and Banana Boat is the best for the price for a semi-immediate tan, plus a nice medium-term tan that blends nicely and last 3-5 days.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why anyone would spend more on other fancy schmancy brands at higher prices?</li>
    <li> As a redhead I cannot get a natural tan (nor do i want the wrinkles and sun damage) and just don&#x27;t care for the visible blue veins glowing through my nearly-clear skin.. i had tried the gradual &#x27;healthy glow&#x27; lotion and liked that fairly well but was looking for a touch more color. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and am quite happy with the results. It provides a decent noticeable amount of color that i am pleased with but not so much that it looks extremely brown and unnatural. It blends very well without streaking, the color does collect around my ankles/feet but that seems par for the course with self-tanners so i just go lightly on those areas. The instructions say to wash your hands immediately after applying and i did that for the first few applications but found i was developing a line where my arms/wrists had color but my hands were still pale. Now when i wash my hands i try to scrub mainly my palms only, dab dry on a towel, then rub the backs of my hands together to keep some of the lotion leftover on the backs of my hands. That has worked out better. I reapply probably every 2-3 days to maintain. I will definitely buy this again &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a ex redhead with fair skin and all the other products make me look&lt;br /&gt;like a giant pumpkin. Since this is the only product I&#x27;ve found for light/.medium&lt;br /&gt;skin I tried it and it is fantastic. Only one slight problem as it does not always&lt;br /&gt;go on streak free, but a little care on applying can usually take care of that problem&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Banana Boat for at least caring about&lt;br /&gt;us light skinned ones...apparently you&#x27;re the only one!</li>
    <li> I have used Banana Boat Color for about 3 years and actively search for it in any general store I enter.  It is so easy to apply evenly and the color (Light/Medium) is perfect for my skin tone.  Just glad I found a steady supply through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used banana boats summer color for years. My sister couldn&#x27;t get it in Ohio last tear so I got some on line an sent it to her. We both like it cause it gives us a little summer tan and summer glow.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few sunless tanners over the years and this is BY FAR the best.  It provides a nice bronze immediately after application, which helps ensure you get full coverage.  While it does have a bit of a smell, it is significantly less than the scent of other products on the market.  Best of all, no orange tones!  The light-medium is perfect for nearly all skintones and gives you nice, even color.  Friends thought I started tanning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results, apply 2-3 hours before bed.  Exfoliate and shave first, then apply lotion to your elbows and knees only.  This creates a buffer on areas that are most apt to turn orange.  Then, apply a thin coat to your entire body.  For your face, consider mixing with your moisturizer and applying that to thin the color a bit.  Put on loose fitting clothes and relax!  In the morning, shower again.  Some of the color will come off, leaving you with a perfectly tanned glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until you get the desired color you want, apply every 2-3 days.  Then, just apply 1-2 times a week to maintain your color.</li>
    <li> I have pink-toned, Caucasian skin that doesn&#x27;t tan - it just turns pink and then red before going back to pasty white. This stuff actually works and makes me look like I got a tan. I applied it after showering and after applying a regular lotion to my feet, knees, elbows, and hands. Starting at my legs I worked my way up and made sure the lotion was thoroughly rubbed in before moving up. After four days of application, people were asking me if I&#x27;d been to the beach. My parents even commented that I looked healthy with a tan. I was paranoid that I would look orange but I just look tan. I will warn that it takes a while to dry so don&#x27;t expect to apply it and dress quickly. I usually have to standing around my room for 15 minutes to make sure it dries completely before getting dressed and going about my day.</li>
    <li> It works great looks natural and doesn&#x27;t really streak. I would suggest though not to use to much and to wear gloves.</li>
    <li> Good product and good delivery&lt;br /&gt;Cream goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t streak. This version gives a nice golden glow.....not an bright orange obviously fake tan!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. She looks beautifully tan with no smear or smudge marks like other products. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> It smells good but it&#x27;s a bit orange. I definitely had some tanning going on after 2-3 days but when I wore tight jeans, it left a mark (from the sewing on both sides) for at least a week, which wasn&#x27;t very sexy.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for the past couple of years.  It goes on evenly, produces just the right amount of color, doesn&#x27;t have that sickening odor, doesn&#x27;t rub off on my clothing and towels, and is very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I just started using - it seems OK, however, it feels more like paint - I noticed when I washed my face the next day that my washcloth was dirty (i.e. paint rubbed off) I don&#x27;t know if I put the stuff on too thick, it seemed to be absorbed into my skin OK so I am not sure why the dirty face the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HUGE WARING!! I was a bit sloppy in my application, and got tanning lotion on my beard and on hairlines.  Low and behold, the next day I had orange-red hair where I got the tanning lotion on.  Must be very careful!  My daughter told me to put Vaseline on hairline to avoid absorption by hair.</li>
    <li> Great product.  My legs did turn a little orange, but it was so easy to use.  Didn&#x27;t last long, but did the job.</li>
    <li> While it does provide color, no matter how long you wait it still comes off on your clothes. No matter how good you wash your hand, your nails still stain ( and it does not come out). No matter how little you use, the smell over powers.</li>
    <li> This moisturizes well and leaves a subtle color thats non-streaky and not orange-y either. It looks natural and not overbearing. I&#x27;m somewhat pale and it doesn&#x27;t look ridiculous on me. It also seems to soak in and not leave any residue behind like a lot of tanning lotions do.</li>
    <li> After reading the other reviews, I decided to buy this product.  Yes, you get a good color and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  But OMG, be ready when it starts to fade.  You will have very blotchy skin.  I would exfoliate every day in the shower when using a self tanner so I know the rules, but this product still fades in a blotchy ugly look.  Also, be careful with light colored clothing the same day you put on the self tanner.  I&#x27;ve had some garments ruined because I couldn&#x27;t get the tanner out in the wash or dry cleaned.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff it makes me looks so pretty tan and not an orange tan either.&lt;br /&gt;Beware use too much and water will make you looked streaked then you will need to exfoliate and start over.</li>
    <li> advertised as no Oder, NOT.  OK smell for fake tan</li>
    <li> Bottom Line: this product doesn&#x27;t work!  I wanted a little color, but the only thing it really colored was my freckles or other skin spots, so now they are even more noticeable.  In white areas, it hardly provided any color...seems to get darker where there is hair on arms and legs.  And the color is a weird orange/yellow, rather than something resembling tan.  All-in-all, I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> No smell, good,light color and excellent value!</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly without streaks, smells nice, feels nice and not sticky or greasy.  It gets 4 stars because it is just a little too orangey.  But I still use it.</li>
    <li> must use with gloves, still smells just like other self-tanning lotions, put it on at night, allow to dry, shower in morning, 3 applications and i was noticeably tanner. better than jergens or any other products i&#x27;ve used before.</li>
    <li> prefer the light/medium over the darker shade ... no blotches, easy application.  Just make sure to wash your hands/fingernails well after applying the lotion</li>
    <li> Banana Boats Summer Color Light/Medium  looks very natural,  easy to apply with no streaks. I think it&#x27;s the best ever.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many self-tanners from very expensive to inexpensive and they all turned me orange.  Banana Boat is the first product that didn&#x27;t.  It gave me a very nice natural bronze color, is streak free and no unpleasant odor. I am going to stock up on this product, since I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in Alberta,Canada</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t even the darkest bottle you can get &amp; you can get this at Walmart for $6-7. Works great! Just not to pay so much online when it is as easy and cheap to get as a regular bottle of lotion anywhere.</li>
    <li> I have pale skin with yellow undertones. Most self-tanners make me look gross, but this product gives me the perfect shade of sunkissed. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works great and lasts longer than a few days.  The light/medium gives a nice color without too much.  Soft skin and no odor like some other products.  Would recommend.</li>
