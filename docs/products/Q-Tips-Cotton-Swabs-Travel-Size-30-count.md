      <li>These smaller containers of Q-tips can be kept in your car glove box, purse, kitchen drawer, garage, etc  and are completely sealed in their container and stay clean.  </li>
      <li>These little packs are so easy to throw onto your purse or carry-on.</li>
      <li>However, I will mention that currently this option is available in a pink case.</li>
      <li>So there&#x27;s not much to say about &#x27;em, haha.</li>

<li> I received pink, not blue as the item lists.  </li>
<li> It arrived in pink dispensers, not the blue as it was advertised and pictured.</li>
<li> I last ordered these in March of 2015 and had them shipped directly to a military APO, AE address.  </li>
<li> all in baby pink dispensers, not the blue in all the product images.</li>
<li> The case is fairly hard plastic, easily opened to be used, but stiff enough not to open through jostling and unlikely to be damaged.  </li>
<li> I will probably just refill these when they are empty as they are sturdy containers.  </li>
<li> And you can definitely uo cycle the hard plastic containers for desk organization or crafts.</li>
<li> They are dusty pink not blue--at least in the order we received.</li>
<li> I mean, they&#x27;re Q-tips..</li>
<li> I am  disappointed.</li>

    <li> Fast Shipping. Item as described.</li>
    <li> Q-Tips Cotton Swabs Purse Travel Size Pack 30 are handy. This is the first time I have ordered them. They fit in my purse. They are great to have  available either in a purse, your car glove compartment, or miscellaneous travel bag.  I recommend these travel size cotton swabs for travel.</li>
    <li> Same great Q-tips, just in nice little travel packs that can be refilled.</li>
    <li> I bought these to put in my permanent travel pack (the one-of-everything grab-&#x27;n-go bag)  replacing some swabs which had been wrapped in a plastic sandwich bag and tied with a rubber band which was getting pretty ratty.  The multi-pack gave me a spare or two, plus some to share.  The case is fairly hard plastic, easily opened to be used, but stiff enough not to open through jostling and unlikely to be damaged.  The hard case takes up a bit more room but provides much more protection.</li>
    <li> One of the reasons I ordered these was because one of the rooms I want to use them in has a blue decor. I received an 8-pack... all in baby pink dispensers, not the blue in all the product images. Not enough of an issue to send them back, but a minor inconvenience. So just FYI. Otherwise, all good.</li>
    <li> The cotton swab is very soft and gentle to the skin.I like the quantity very well.It is good for the skin.</li>
    <li> Good both for travel and for daily use, conveniently packaged for both types of use, and very reasonably priced:  a fine combination of attributes.</li>
    <li> I have been using the QTips Cotton Swabs Purse size for sometime. What I love about it is it&#x27;s compact size.  It is good for travel and fits easily in your handbag.  Good for makeup touchups when your eyeliner runs or is too thick.  I also, like the fact that most QTips come in a larger size and when you go to use them,some of them spill out.The plastic on this holds everything in place and makes it easy to use.</li>
    <li> Loved finding a decent sized packet of name brand Q-tips that will easily fit into a variety of packing places.  Can recycle the container or properly dispose of it if space is an issue.</li>
    <li> earwax has met its match.  this handy travel pack is cerumen&#x27;s nemesis .  affortable and convenient, a strong commitment to hygiene.  buy with confience when your otic canal has that no so fresh feeling</li>
    <li> Great plastic packages for travel ,medicine cabinet , and handbag or sports bag use. And you can definitely uo cycle the hard plastic containers for desk organization or crafts. Beware. They are dusty pink not blue--at least in the order we received.</li>
    <li> What can I say except they do the job.  These smaller containers of Q-tips can be kept in your car glove box, purse, kitchen drawer, garage, etc  and are completely sealed in their container and stay clean.  I will probably just refill these when they are empty as they are sturdy containers.  Items were well packaged and arrived fast.</li>
    <li> It arrived in pink dispensers, not the blue as it was advertised and pictured. I am  disappointed.</li>
    <li> These travel size packs come in very handy. Now I can keep Q-Tips in all the places where I often find that I need them besides just the bathroom. I have carried them around in the glove compartment in a zip-lock bag or pill bottle, but after handling them, they would get kind of &amp;#34;roughed up&amp;#34;. The travel pack keeps them clean and intact. Great to keep in a jacket pocket also.</li>
    <li> I received pink, not blue as the item lists.  Otherwise, they work great.</li>
    <li> if you travel alot, and have limited space in your suit case these a a very nice option to have when you are packing !</li>
    <li> These little packs are so easy to throw onto your purse or carry-on. And you don&#x27;t have to settle for a no name brand just because you need a travel size.</li>
    <li> I mean, they&#x27;re Q-tips.. So there&#x27;s not much to say about &#x27;em, haha. However, I will mention that currently this option is available in a pink case. As if the product wasn&#x27;t effeminate enough already lol.. WOOHOO for Q-tips on the go! &#x3D;P</li>
    <li> Good product but can buy cheaper elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Do not probe into the ear canal... Yeah, right. Go deep or go home.</li>
    <li> Love these in the travel size, they don&#x27;t take up much space in the bathroom.  The package came timely and well wrapped.</li>
    <li> Q-tips are always in demand.  These are used for personal hygiene but also for cleaning sand out of nooks and crannies in weapons.  These travel size packs are the way to go and this eight pack is great for sharing.  I last ordered these in March of 2015 and had them shipped directly to a military APO, AE address.  I paid $12.45 at that time.</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel! and also nice quality.</li>
