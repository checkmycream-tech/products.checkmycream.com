      <li>Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser&lt;br</li>
      <li>solution is gentle like the name says, it doesn&#x27;t sting.  </li>
      <li>product is gentle on my face and does everything that I need it to do.</li>

      <li>One of the main ingredients is sodium lauryl sulfate.  </li>

    <li> I have not used this yet after I was told that this can cause cancer so I did some research and every article says so apparently after putting this on your face the toxins go in your bloodstream and the ingredient that causes the cancer is sodium lauryl sulfate.. I really want to use this because of the reviews but I&#x27;m scared.</li>
    <li> Gentle skin cleanser.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be gentler on my dry skin than the stuff I normally get from Ulta.  It made my skin feel dry and tight.  I will not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ts very light but cleanses the skin well even after all the dirt and grime of a dustry African/Asian city.</li>
    <li> This product smells AWFUL. It is so bad I stopped using after one time. I&#x27;m not sure if they changed their formulation or something because I do not remember this smell before, but in any case, for someone with sensitive skin, I don&#x27;t like anything with harsh smells. And this is not only harsh, but, well, gross. Stay away!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!! IDK Y i didnt try this a long time ago.... U can use with or without water. I use on any part of my body, works great for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Soothing product for a good cleanse! I would not recommend this for people with bad acne, because this cleanser is geared more for people with very sensitive  or dry skin who just need a good squeaky clean wash &amp;#60;3 It will not dry out your skin and the formula is a gel-like cleanser with teeny tiny microbeads that work to clean your face of any dirt or oil, but still leave it moisturized afterwards :)</li>
    <li> Ilike it .. It&#x27;s soap free ,very gentle on the skin especially with sensative skin as my skin &amp;#62;&amp;#62;and u could use it when u want 2 do a peel totally save</li>
    <li> I love Cetaphil face cleanser. I have used it for years. It&#x27;s easy on sensitive skin. And this seller was great to work with, too. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have used this for a long time and still love it. Cleans well, rinses off with no residue and your skin is soft and clean. Can&#x27;t think about using anything else....why would I.?? Works great with my Clarisonic too..!!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good facial cleanser I use it at night before I go to bed and I  believe it has helped with my acne, I haven&#x27;t broken out in a long time ever since I started using this along with my Clinique moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I went on a search for gentle skin cleansers and this one appealed to me because of the low price.  I wish I had checked the ingredients before ordering it, because I might have been able to guess how my skin would react.  One of the main ingredients is sodium lauryl sulfate.

    <li> This was specifically recommended by FitBit as a way to safely clean the strap of the FitBit Charge HR. It does the job quite well and is easy to use / apply and clean off. It is also (as it was intended) a great facial cleaner.</li>
    <li> ive had less breakouts since i started using this and my skin just looks much cleaner and better overall. definitely a must have if you have cystic acne</li>
    <li> Product is amazing. I upgraded to the bigger bottle. This small bottle lasted me about a month, using a small amount every day.</li>
    <li> Ugh.  I got this with another lotion in the order. I went to use this and discovered the lotion was not sealed, as if it had already been opened.  It was only a 4 oz bottle so I discarded it. Yuck.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect face wash to use in between facial peels. It&#x27;s a light cleanser and it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue. It&#x27;s also great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My skin is so sensitive that this is the only thing I use to wash my face! I also use this and their antibacterial soap for my hands. It works great.</li>
    <li> Good product, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, gentle cleanser for everyday use.  Removes make-up, leaves face feeling smooth and does not dry out the skin.  Also, not tested on animals.</li>
    <li> O.k., I do not know what happened with the size of this product as of late.  They are getting smaller and smaller.  I am not interested in purchasing a couple of large bottles at one time. can be a little expensive esp. when shipping and handling is involved.  Now for the product, I do love it since my dermatologist recommends same.  I have been using this product for a couple of years now.</li>
    <li> Once upon a time, I had crappy skin. My dermatologist recommended this product and I have been using it ever since. It gets rid of make up really well, and the fact that you can use it with or without water is pretty amazing. My complexion is so much better because of this product and I would recommend it for oily to very dry skin. It doesn&#x27;t strip your skin, and it&#x27;s perfect for use before any other skin care product you might use to treat your face. I will continue to use this product for the rest of my life. LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> So gentle it is used in hospitals for newborns. I did my homework before buying this for a grandchild with dry skin rash. Worked just as the experts described.</li>
    <li> Great travel size!! Greasy scent!!</li>
    <li> This was not cetaphil. It was white instead of clear, so some other cleanser in a cetaphil bottle.</li>
    <li> This is comparable to Neutrogena skin care products. My dermatologist recommends both. Very mild &amp; gentle (if u have sensitive skin like I do) on your face. The Cetaphil specifically leaves your skin with a lotion residue after rinsing. I like that especially in dry winter months.</li>
    <li> I had to wait to see just how good this was I probably will order product again but just not from this place. I needed something is not soap as my face has redness in winter and flakes from being dry, why in winter I don&#x27;t know. butI think this will help so far I have used it 2 Xs helped.</li>
    <li> Like many of the reviewers here, I have sensitive combination skin. I typically struggle with redness, small flakiness around my nose, and tightness after I wash my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is gentle on my face and does everything that I need it to do. I still notice it to be slightly drying, but that&#x27;s an easy fix - I typically pair this with a moisturizing night cream and my skin ends up happy :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great as a skin smoother. My skin has been so much silkier after using this product. The downside is that it is not effective at removing makeup or deep cleaning the skin. I recommend using a makeup remover, then a deep cleanser, and if you want the smoothing effect use this Cetaphil last.</li>
    <li> good buy, i would recommend this to anyone that wants to buy a cleanser, it has made my face clearer, and i would buy this again, but i should buy the larger size next time though... this one is too small, but when it finishes i am definitely getting a larger size..</li>
    <li> I am shocked that dermatologists recommend this for those allergic to fragrance.... I am allergic to any fragrance and this is NOT fragrance free- the ingredients say &amp;#34;fragrance- masking&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;ve always heard that if it doesn&#x27;t say fragrance free it could contain some.  Very disappointed in this!!!</li>
    <li> This works gently to remove dirt, oil, makeup, and is a bargain compared to many other cleansers. Cleans thoroughly without irritation. A must in my skincare routine.</li>
    <li> This is far and away the best cleanser for those of us with this problem.  For that reason, I don&#x27;t use every day. Very highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I am loving my Cetaphil facewash. I really feel like my skin is clean after I use it. I had blemishes for a while and have used alot of different products including ProActive which is still a great product. But the Cetaphil doesn;t dry my face out and I have super sensitive skin, even the first time I used it there was no irritation. I recommend this product highly!!!</li>
    <li> Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;The solution is gentle like the name says, it doesn&#x27;t sting.  Good for cleaning dirty skin site or dirty superficial wounds.  It even helps with cleaning anal area for incontinent individual.</li>
    <li> I have used cetaphil products before and I am very satisfied with this cleaner. I use it to clean my fitbit and it works like a charm. No greasy residue left over or skin irritations.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my new tattoos as well as my face when I&#x27;m done using it for tattoos.</li>
    <li> It cleans well and is gentle! My husband just hates it because it looks like cum... he doesn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I first starting using cetaphil when my newborn had a rash on her face and I didn&#x27;t want to use a harsh med. Over the years it has soothed diaper rash and dry skin. Its a great gentle face cleanser too.</li>
