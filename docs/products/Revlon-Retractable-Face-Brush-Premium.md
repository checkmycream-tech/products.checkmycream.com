      <li>This brush is a perfect size and bristles are perfect, too!</li>
      <li>The size is perfect for carrying around in a purse.  </li>
      <li>so it picks up and transfers product onto the face perfectly.</li>
      <li>I bought this brush to replace the awesome one from Mary Kay that I had.</li>
      <li>PERFECT MUST HAVE!</li>
      <li>Great</li>
      <li>This is great for my work bag.  </li>
      <li>It applies my product nicely and evenly, it&#x27;s just falling apart!</li>
      <li>For the price, it&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>Good price, too.</li>
      <li>Good product &amp; price.</li>
      <li>I LOVE that this brush retracts!</li>
      <li>So when traveling and space is at a premium this would do nicely as a prefect multi-purpose brush.  </li>
      <li>This is a really handy blush brush.</li>
      <li>The cover does stay on the brush well, which is nice.</li>
      <li>, i will buy 2 plus, the finish is perfect and natural, the blush it seems that it was the color of my skin  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to carry and I&#x27;m quite glad I found it!</li>
      <li>It applies my bare mineral foundation perfectly.</li>
      <li>The brush easily stows away in the lid without catching on its brushes.</li>
      <li>They are compact yet full, fit nicely in your purse and do as good a job as many more expense brushes.  </li>
      <li>Love that it has a cap</li>
      <li>So whether you need for makeup application or for cleaning equipment, this is a great all-around brush.</li>
      <li>honestly i think this is great for you to have on your bag but its too soft</li>
      <li>I love a covered brush so powder and blush don&#x27;t end up over everything in my makeup bag.</li>
      <li>Nice brush, stays clean with the cover.  </li>
      <li>Very easy to use, &amp; stays clean.</li>
      <li>Compact and easy to take with you, stays clean!</li>
      <li>The size is fine but this brush is cheaply made.</li>
      <li>It lightly brushes the face powder on, so you don&#x27;t look too overdone.  </li>
      <li>I thought that perhaps it would stop happening after the first few uses, but no - I eventually threw it out after a couple of weeks and ended up buying the Sonia Kashuk Travel Brush (also retractable), am very happy with it.</li>
      <li>Loved it so much, I have two and plan on buying several more.  </li>
      <li>The brush is nice and soft.</li>
      <li>Overall it is a good brush</li>
      <li>Great for travel &amp; everyday use for touch-ups</li>
      <li>Easy to manage and the bristles are very soft.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s big enough to do the job, and it&#x27;s a great size for traveling, too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good little travel brush but does shed some.</li>
      <li>I would love to find another brush exactly like this one, but made with higher-quality bristles and overall design</li>
      <li>All the brushes marketed for the purposes of cleaning camera equipment were either too big or didn&#x27;t have a cap (and cost more).  </li>
      <li>I love the design of this brush, but the bristles are low-quality and constantly falling out every time I use it!!</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I was looking for to take on trips.</li>
      <li>I guess small is good for carrying with you</li>
      <li>Easy twist for use and back to compact for storage!</li>
      <li>It folds up against your face so it doesn&#x27;t deposit the make up very well.</li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t really like it</li>
      <li>but I use it for my whole face</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this brush so much that when looking for a natural hair, soft brush for a lens cleaner for my camera, I got a second one of these.  </li>
      <li>Nice bristles on the brush and the lid stays on when its in your purse or bag and its small and compact.</li>
      <li>It does lose the occasional stray hair in this brush but it&#x27;s not bad . . .</li>
      <li>I love these little brushes.  </li>
      <li>I buy a new brush every couple of months.</li>
      <li>It was smaller than I anticipated but it still works well and is sleek enough to fit in my makeup bag.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also really light and pretty small.  </li>
      <li>After several uses I ended with more black hairs on my face than powder.</li>
      <li>I originally purchased this item as I needed small brush that I could easily carry around and other reviewers seemed to like it.</li>
      <li>I wish the head was a little bigger so that there would be more area for the brush to pick up product.</li>
      <li>So far this one has been sturdy.</li>
      <li>Good for a travel brush, but not nearly big or fluffy enough for everyday makeup application.</li>
      <li>Super soft, but stiff enough to blend.</li>
      <li>I wear very little makeup and apply powder lightly, but every (EVERY) time I used this brush the bristles broke off into tiny pieces</li>
      <li>This brush works well and is made of natural bristles but it is smaller than I had hoped.</li>

<li> Good product, performed as expected, just a little difficult to open</li>
<li> really had no confidence in this brush, it looked ugly and cheap, when I tried it , I totally change my opinion</li>
<li> This brush is about 4\\&quot; long, not 6.5\\&quot; Much smaller than the description.</li>
<li> The brush is not very soft.</li>
<li> This was smaller than I expected it to be, but it doesn&#x27;t affect anything about me putting my make-up on.</li>
<li> I use it for loose powder application every morning.</li>
<li> The texture is synthetic and the stroke is loose, leaving a lot of powder in the air rather than on the face.</li>
<li> I was looking for a brush I could keep in my purse with my loose powder.</li>
<li> I use it for loose powder application during the day to avoid having a shiny face.</li>
<li> and I was left with 5-10 little brush hairs on my face.</li>
<li> It is compact when closed, and doesn&#x27;t get blush or powder in your travel cosmetic bag.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a bit harsh and doesn&#x27;t have enough bristles in my opinion.</li>
<li> This brush is small and simple.</li>
<li> So not worth the purchase!</li>
<li> The brush is not as fluffy as I had hoped.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a bit stiff.</li>
<li> Its small and putting the cap over the bristles is not easy.</li>
<li> The brush isn&#x27;t too thick (unlike the ecotools face brushes)</li>
<li> Believe the negative reviews!</li>
<li> I guess I put that comment in the wrong place.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this annoying product.</li>
<li> hated this product; not easy to use</li>
<li> so it won&#x27;t get all dirty</li>
<li> Horrible, flimsy, sheds!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> hated this product; not easy to use</li>
    <li> Good product &amp; price. Very easy to use, &amp; stays clean.</li>
    <li> For the price, it&#x27;s good. The texture is synthetic and the stroke is loose, leaving a lot of powder in the air rather than on the face. But besides that, it&#x27;s a standard functioning brush.</li>
    <li> Good product, performed as expected, just a little difficult to open</li>
    <li> I always recommend Revlon products.  The bristles on this brush are durable.  The size is perfect for carrying around in a purse.  The brush itself is durable. I recommend this.</li>
    <li> I guess I put that comment in the wrong place. I said it was alright but I thought the brush was should be bigger</li>
    <li> This is great for my work bag.  Easy twist for use and back to compact for storage!</li>
    <li> I love the design of this brush, but the bristles are low-quality and constantly falling out every time I use it!! It applies my product nicely and evenly, it&#x27;s just falling apart! I would love to find another brush exactly like this one, but made with higher-quality bristles and overall design so it lasts longer...</li>
    <li> Nice bristles on the brush and the lid stays on when its in your purse or bag and its small and compact.</li>
    <li> The brush is not as fluffy as I had hoped. It&#x27;s a bit stiff. I use it for loose powder application during the day to avoid having a shiny face. The cover does stay on the brush well, which is nice.</li>
    <li> This brush works well and is made of natural bristles but it is smaller than I had hoped. I guess small is good for carrying with you but I use it for my whole face so I would have been happier with a larger brush.</li>
    <li> It does lose the occasional stray hair in this brush but it&#x27;s not bad . . .</li>
    <li> honestly i think this is great for you to have on your bag but its too soft i don&#x27;t really like it</li>
    <li> Loved it so much, I have two and plan on buying several more.  Great it is retractable!  Compact and easy to take with you, stays clean!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this item as I needed small brush that I could easily carry around and other reviewers seemed to like it. The size is fine but this brush is cheaply made.

Don&#x27;t waste your money on this annoying product.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for to take on trips. It applies my bare mineral foundation perfectly. Good price, too.</li>
    <li> The brush is nice and soft. The size of the brush is in between my regular powder brush and blush brush.  So when traveling and space is at a premium this would do nicely as a prefect multi-purpose brush.  Love that it has a cap so it won&#x27;t get all dirty and I can through it in my purse.  It&#x27;s also really light and pretty small.  When packed up, it&#x27;s about 4 inches long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this brush so much that when looking for a natural hair, soft brush for a lens cleaner for my camera, I got a second one of these.  All the brushes marketed for the purposes of cleaning camera equipment were either too big or didn&#x27;t have a cap (and cost more).  A cap is imperative to keep debris out of the brush so you are removing dirt instead of adding.  This brush is working perfectly for that.  So whether you need for makeup application or for cleaning equipment, this is a great all-around brush.</li>
    <li> I love these little brushes.  They are compact yet full, fit nicely in your purse and do as good a job as many more expense brushes.  I keep one at home and one in my purse.</li>
    <li> This brush is small and simple. It was smaller than I anticipated but it still works well and is sleek enough to fit in my makeup bag. Overall it is a good brush and I would recommend it to anyone needing a simple powder brush!</li>
    <li> It is compact when closed, and doesn&#x27;t get blush or powder in your travel cosmetic bag.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a brush I could keep in my purse with my loose powder. After several uses I ended with more black hairs on my face than powder.</li>
    <li> The brush is not very soft. It&#x27;s a bit harsh and doesn&#x27;t have enough bristles in my opinion. It folds up against your face so it doesn&#x27;t deposit the make up very well. I might just use it for concealer or something, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> Easy to manage and the bristles are very soft.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good little travel brush but does shed some.</li>
    <li> I love a covered brush so powder and blush don&#x27;t end up over everything in my makeup bag. This brush is a perfect size and bristles are perfect, too!</li>
    <li> This brush is about 4\\&quot; long, not 6.5\\&quot; Much smaller than the description. Good for a travel brush, but not nearly big or fluffy enough for everyday makeup application.</li>
    <li> This was smaller than I expected it to be, but it doesn&#x27;t affect anything about me putting my make-up on. It&#x27;s big enough to do the job, and it&#x27;s a great size for traveling, too. I buy a new brush every couple of months. The ones I was purchasing from Wal-Mart kept falling apart. So far this one has been sturdy. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to replace the awesome one from Mary Kay that I had. MK stopped selling theirs so I was looking for a comparable product. This was not it! Gave it 3 stars since it does still do the job. I use it for loose powder application every morning. Its small and putting the cap over the bristles is not easy. Quality is under par for me. I will have to replace a lot sooner than the MK brush.</li>
    <li> I LOVE that this brush retracts! The brush isn&#x27;t too thick (unlike the ecotools face brushes) so it picks up and transfers product onto the face perfectly. My only con is the size of the head. I wish the head was a little bigger so that there would be more area for the brush to pick up product. Otherwise, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars! Great for travel &amp; everyday use for touch-ups</li>
    <li> This is a really handy blush brush. I purchased one to take in my cosmetic case on the go and one to keep at home. The brush easily stows away in the lid without catching on its brushes.</li>
    <li> Horrible, flimsy, sheds! So not worth the purchase! They should discontinue this item as it&#x27;s a joke! Believe the negative reviews!</li>
    <li> really had no confidence in this brush, it looked ugly and cheap, when I tried it , I totally change my opinion, i will buy 2 plus, the finish is perfect and natural, the blush it seems that it was the color of my skin  PERFECT MUST HAVE!</li>
    <li> Nice brush, stays clean with the cover.  Super soft, but stiff enough to blend.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for one of these for some time.  It lightly brushes the face powder on, so you don&#x27;t look too overdone.  It&#x27;s easy to carry and I&#x27;m quite glad I found it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s made well and works well.  I like it because the brush will always stay clean.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
