      <li>Not the best color for mehndi, it does not stain as dark, but I love it for hair.</li>

      <li>Easy to use.</li>

      <li>Smooth as silk and strong in color.  </li>
      <li>Came in extremely fast and satisfied!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this henna. I used it because I was told it was like a natural relaxer and my hair was FLAWLESS for like a week. I think I may be washing it too frequently though cause it&#x27;s starting to frizz again. But I&#x27;m definitely going to keep using it! You can see the color difference too, I left it on for 4 hrs with lemon juice, coconut milk, and coffee.</li>
    <li> Does what it is suppose to do. Use with indigo to turn hair black. Add grapeseed oil to counteract the dryness.</li>
    <li> Worst thing that has ever, ever happened to my hair. It completely destroyed my hair color PERMANENTLY. It will take years to recover. THIS IS BEING DISHONESTLY MARKETED. WHAT I RECEIVED WAS CLEARLY NOT REAL HENNA - AVOID! I recognize the possibility that I received an unusually bad package (based on other positive reviews), but this level of quality control of unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using henna for several years now. I prepared Jamila Henna like I do with all other body art quality hennas I&#x27;ve purchased - lemon juice and water, and 18 hours of curing time in a dark place.  I left this on my hair for 4 hours, which is what I always do. This methodology has worked well with genuine henna powders I have purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result was the most hideous shade of very dark brown. Not even a hint of red. Not even a hint of dark red or burgundy. I tried to have a professional remove it, to no results. I&#x27;ve tried stripping it with overnight oil treatments, to no results. I have successfully deposited some red over the awful brown with better henna, but the fact remains that it is very dark and very saturated with a horrible color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t destroy your hair with this product. The only way to remove the results of this product is trimming off hair as it grows, and that takes an awfully long time.</li>
    <li> Quality henna. I add a little ACV to help lighten my chocolate colored hair.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprized! I gave this henna 4 stars instead of 5 because this was last summer&#x27;s crop (2013 June). BUT this did not effect the amount of dye release for my relaxed hair. I will buy from them again for the low $$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;S. Evans</li>
    <li> I have used henna over the last five years.  This batch was the absolute worst.  It broke my hair off.  Try another vender!!!!  This Jamila batch is wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy off! Henna always leaves my hair feeling strong and shiny.  My skin broke out and my hair broke off!</li>
    <li> Loosened my curls a little bit, but I noticed that after the henna treatment my hair became finer. It tinted my hair red a tiny bit as well and my natural hair color is dark brown.</li>
    <li> did not get 2014 crop, I got 2013 and here is a photo of it. This henna is too old and won&#x27;t color your hair like represented. Refunds mean you have to pay for return shipping which is almost as much as the henna.</li>
    <li> This is quality henna.... The best I have ever had thus far and will continue to purchase this brand. I like the fact that it is strictly henna instead of henna mixed with other herbslike what a lot of brands sell it.</li>
    <li> I found it gave great results.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality at a very good price. I&#x27;ll be buying this again. This is the second time I&#x27;ve used henna. The first time I used a different brand and followed the box directions. That was a mistake. It really does need to be mixed the night before (and add a little lemon juice) so that the color can start to oxidize. It turned a much richer color with less brassy orange. It also took less time. I love how silky my hair is!</li>
    <li> It is good quality henna and for that I would give it a 4 star rating but the price is nearly 3 times what I paid for the same exact item at the local India grocery I found about 20 min from my house about a week after I purchased here.</li>
    <li> Nice Product Will Buy Again</li>
    <li> I love using this for my hair!!</li>
    <li> Loved this stuff! It was fresh, and when I finally got the ingredients for my henna paste right, it stained beautifully!</li>
    <li> Quick-activitation henna, good color and conditions well</li>
    <li> Great product and easy to mix. I have bought this product numerous times.</li>
    <li> This  product  did  not  work&lt;br /&gt;My hair  did  not  color  black and I did  do the henna and indigo  2part  process  and no it wasn&#x27;t black  at all  the henna  change  my hair  reddish  orange but  the  indigo did  not  turn it  black  left  the company  a message  no response.</li>
    <li> I love this henna! It arrived fast and the quality was very good. I mixed it with lemon juice, let it sit 12 hours, then about 20 minutes in the hot Houston sun and the stain was fantastic! My hair is super black, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be red, but it actually lightened my hair a bit. Will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Affordable and does the job very well.  All natural just got better for me.</li>
    <li> I have used henna for years now.  I had used another brand which must have started adding something besides pure henna, as I ended up with turquoise hair!!!!  I switched to pure Jamila henna and am back to red again and very happy.</li>
    <li> this is pure henna, it makes your hair feel very thick, great product you can rely on.</li>
    <li> Well sifted, premium henna which turned my kinky, coily hair a beautiful auburn color. Awesome product and great price!</li>
    <li> This says it&#x27;s for hair but I used it for a tattoo because it was cheaper and it totally worked really well so I would recommend this for skin as well as hair.</li>
    <li> Used Jamila to dye my hair for years. Not the best color for mehndi, it does not stain as dark, but I love it for hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product,  I used it for henna on my hand.  Mixed it with lemon juice,  water,  and oil let it set over night.  Nice ink lasted about 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Great quality henna with beautiful color</li>
    <li> Came in extremely fast and satisfied! Very powdery so there&#x27;s no chunks needed to be crushed. I&#x27;ve used this on my friends and myself and they were all very pleased. Many more friends want to get a henna tat as well! :) this is muchhhhh much cheaper, reliable, and have great quality! I don&#x27;t need to waste $12 at earthbound anymore, not worth it.</li>
    <li> great henna.  wonderful price.  it was great to see a packaging date on the bottom.</li>
    <li> I use henna as a gloss to add a bit of color to my hair, but also to condition it. I&#x27;ve purchased this product more than once, and both times the henna has been very fresh, and is the most recent season&#x27;s crop. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> One box had lead &amp; plastic was full of powder - not sure about how old this henna is... but the dye quality is really nice</li>
    <li> Organic, of constant good quality. Rrived intact and ready to be used. Very good business practices. Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> Very smooth and fine paste, hardly have to sift it for henna tattoos, although I suggest you do</li>
    <li> Give my hair the shine it needs! My hair feels stronger less shedding and no more split ends!!</li>
    <li> I really like using this henna, it gives a nice red stain and gave my hair some well needed body. It somehow changed the texture of my hair, so it may actually be true that it loosens curls a little. My hair started reacting differently to products as well which I appreciated. Use with some oil and conditioner if you can&#x27;t handle a full treatment or want to make a box last. I feel like it&#x27;s getting more expensive and harder to find though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and I&#x27;m pleased with the color. Jamila Henna Power is the only brand I trust. I&#x27;ve been using this brand for the past two years and have gotten great results.</li>
    <li> It gives my hair a beautiful vibrant color! love it. I  add coffee, and egg to this and it comes out amazing!</li>
    <li> Great quality Henna for a very cheap price. Shipping was fast as well. Perfect!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister&#x27;s hair, because she has Chromes and she doesn&#x27;t like using harsh chemicals.  She loved the way the color coated her hair...I liked it because she was happy. We can get at least two more colors out the box. If you want a natural way to color your hair this is it!</li>
    <li> Jamila is known for its high quality henna powders. This time when i used this, I dont know what went wrong but, there wasn&#x27;t any proper dye release for me. I&#x27;m not saying that it didn&#x27;t dye release at al, just this time, it was very little.</li>
    <li> My first time using it and I luv it</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service and beautiful stain</li>
    <li> Not from 2015 and not body art quality.  I feel like this information was posted clearly.  Hopefully it still works for body art...</li>
    <li> I mixed it how it said and it is so light on my skin it is ridiculous</li>
    <li> Smooth as silk and strong in color.  Jamila Henna Powder is everything the other reviewers say it is.  This product is exactly what I was looking for.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hoping it oxidizes to more of a auburn color. Right now it&#x27;s orange! Yikes!</li>
    <li> Softer, stronger feel for my thick 4b/4c African American hair. I didn&#x27;t know that henna gives your hair a temporary dark red hue and because I have dark brown hair, the henna was noticeable but only for a few months.</li>
    <li> Works every time, I use it on my hair</li>
    <li> I like this henna powder! It comes with a good amount and stains nicely, a dark brown. I used it for henna tattoos. Only downside is the smell, but that doesn&#x27;t really matter :)</li>
    <li> I was looking for an affordable source of henna for my hair. While I&#x27;ve tried to buy the version of this that comes in foil and is dated, that is certainly not what this comes in. This comes 100 g per box and inside the box is a small plastic bag. The boxes are dated, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed with lemon juice until it had a yogurt-like consistency. I let that sit overnight. The next evening we put it into my hair for a few hours. Comes out a bright orange-red color. My hair is shiny and soft. I&#x27;ve used this product twice now to good results both times. I&#x27;ve even frozen the leftovers and used them to touch up my roots between full treatments--not as strong, but good enough to last another four weeks.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I will highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It came FAST, the henna was fresh... I mixed it with the Indigo that also came from this seller. I was very pleased, it left my 3C hair with a very nice deep auburn color (The portion that was chemically colored about 2 years back). My hair seems nice and strong. I will be ordering from this seller again :).</li>
    <li> Jamila Henna powder is very effective when dyeing grey hair. After the Henna process, follow it through with Indigo, which produces dark blue color on top of Henna&#x27;s orange. When the colors combine, it produces a black shade close to natural dark black. The best results one can get by using all natural / plant based products!</li>
    <li> This is a nice, well sifted powder and colors hair very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed it with a little green tea and let it sit in a container for a couple of hours to release the dye. Then I put it on my hair and let it sit for about 5 hours before washing out. It covered my grays nicely and gave a dark reddish hue to my black hair.  (I did have to do a deep conditioner afterwards to soften my hair because henna makes it a little dry and stiff.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I plan to mix it with conditioner and do a henna gloss.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands of Henna in the past, but this stuff is amazing. Its easy to use, and produces a beautiful color on my hair. I naturally have ash blonde hair, this turns it a beautiful shade of dark ginger, over the bleached portions of my hair it turned it a bright fire orange. I&#x27;ve done a couple full head applications to darken that up and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioning benefits alone are worth it! My hair feels silky after I use this.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but it is not current crop 2014 as stated but dated 2013, expiry 2016...</li>
    <li> Terrible product- not only it did not look like other henna powders for hair color, it did not color at all. It was completely wash out after 4 hours of waiting. It was just a waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using another brand of henna for years and years. I read some information on hennablogspot.com and curlynikki.com about Jamila brand and gave it a shot. This is really nice, fresh henna and relatively fine. I was able to rinse it out SO much easier than what I&#x27;ve been using for years. I also added a little Indigo to my mix for the perfect effect. Took care of my few grays and gave me a nice overall deep reddish highlight only noticeable in sunlight on my black hair. Very pleased with the product and seller and I&#x27;m reordering right now. Oh, it arrived very quickly as well!</li>
    <li> The henna is a high quality, and very affordable. I love the tiny packaging, and it came quite quickly. 100 grams was enough to do my shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly. My hair was so soft. ...</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product it has done wonders for her hair. That why I gave it 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DLR</li>
    <li> this powder was very smooth and the color was nice. my gray was not completely covered although this may have been due to only leaving it on for 4 hours. packaging was satisfactory and shipping timely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this twice over the last year and has produced beautiful results each time</li>
    <li> No color change, but made my hair soft. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I like to mix my own henna for henna tattoos, and the quality of this powder is superb. It&#x27;s not chunky, it&#x27;s sifted very well and was easy to mix. It has a beautiful dye and I was extremely pleased, however I received a 2013 crop, not 2014 as it stated, but it&#x27;s still very nice!</li>
    <li> I used this for henna and it worked great</li>
    <li> Fresh, quality product. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> great product, easy to use and lovely color.</li>
    <li> Thought This Was Bigger, However The Bags Came Leaking Powder Out! Wont Be Repurchasing!! Be Sure To Use Henna Correctly!</li>
    <li> So far so good! Got here pretty fast.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I found Henna so cheap! I have natural 4b hair and use it as a protein treatment and with indigo to dye my hair black. It does define/loosen your curl pattern depending on your hair type, though. That&#x27;s unless you add alma to your mix.</li>
    <li> Use to strengthen hair and in conjunction with henna to dye my hair black and it got the job done.</li>
    <li> I use these for my husband&#x27;s hat foot syndrome (side effect of Xeloda).  I can&#x27;t tell for sure whether this is the cause of his improvement, or the footbath, epsom salts, bag balm that I use, but his symptoms did improve.  Worth trying if you have the same problem (see study on line).</li>
    <li> This was the first Henna I tried and my experience was it was alright. Though my experience may have been better if when I was mixing it I didn&#x27;t add too much coconut milk that resulted in it being a little runny making it more like a melted chocolate texture. I also was in such a rush that I applied it one hour after letting it sit(it was also during the week and I had to work in the morning so i only applied for three hours then over nine hours the second time around). I will say it was a nice smooth texture and easy to apply and wash out. I also DC afterwards as one should since henna can be drying. My hair strands are thicker but I didn&#x27;t notice my hair being more soft. I am glad this is a BAQ henna also. I mixed mines with coconut milk, lime juice and added olive oil after letting it sit. I was  going to order again but I decided to try a different brand just to see if I could see a difference. I just did the application last night and have to say I like the other brand better(the one that has the 9 herbs added in it), but that could have been &#x27;cause this time I made sure the consistency was thick like pudding and let it sit for three and a half hours as it says to do. I also left it on overnight and washed out in the morning. I will probably stick with that brand since it has all the extra goodness in it, but if I was to go back to a regular BAQ henna this one would probably be it. I am an African American woman with mostly 4a hair with some 4b, 4c and in the nape a 3c section. I will continue to use henna &#x27;cause after the third application I really see a difference in my hair.  I don&#x27;t really see much color change unless I&#x27;m looking in the light, I have no gray hairs yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will add though my order took longer to ship reason being I ordered something that I did not know was backordered, I had to contact the seller to ask what was the hold up to be told the order was coming in that night. But it didn&#x27;t come in as thought so I had to email the sellerto see why it still hadn&#x27;t been shipped and was told it did not come in yet. So I just decided to have the henna shipped. The staff was very friendly, however it would had been nice if I was told the item was backordered instead of me having to contact them to find out, I otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have ordered that item. Other than that, great company to order from and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> last years crop. scared to use but if i do will update on how it worked.</li>
    <li> I Luv this product. I use it to dye my grey hairs and it gives the best red highlights</li>
    <li> The henna was Fresh and with a full dye release it covered my grays. And it gave my  black Afro-American natural 4c hair a gorgeous dark red hue.</li>
    <li> Do NOT buy this Henna! It&#x27;s the worst Jamila henna I&#x27;ve ever encountered! I buy/use BAQ (Body Art Quality) henna all the time! This isn&#x27;t it! This isn&#x27;t even &#x27;hair&#x27; quality henna. It&#x27;s not pure henna or fresh henna. The box says it&#x27;s unexpired, but the henna inside tells a different story. I should have stuck to my usual henna supplier, but this was cheaper. Learned my lesson!</li>
    <li> This was the first time I have ever purchased Henna of any kind and it worked amazing. I read one of the previous comments and followed their directions - Mix lemon juice in and let sit for 12 hours, mix tee tree oil in and let set another 12 - Used half of the powder and was able to make a lot of designs on my hands and feet. The stain came out to be a reddish brown and left a DARK stain. Wonderful!</li>
    <li> Great quality Henna. Worked as described</li>
    <li> I add about 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar to 1 package and then enough water to make an applesauce consistency. I let it set for about 3 hours. I then apply it to my whole head, put on a plastic shower cap and go about my day as it sets for about six hours. It doesn&#x27;t stain my forehead or face but it sure as heck will stain your hands and fingernails, so wear gloves. It will also stain fabric and carpet so be careful. Afterward, I rinse well, rub a ton of cleansing conditioner in my hair to release the henna and rinse well, rubbing my scalp until the water is completely clear. I do not shampoo until at least 48 hours later but I&#x27;m sure 36 hours is fine, too. My light brown hair becomes a wonderful bright, shiny copper!!</li>
    <li> this is by far the best Henna powder I have found. I was very please wiht the results, My hair felt so silky right after washing off the henna,</li>
    <li> This Henna shipped quickly. It was easy to apply and the color came out great, on the spectrum of red hennas it comes out on the redder side. I leave mine on overnight to let the color soak in. It also did not run onto clothing afterwards, which was good, some henna products do tend to run afterwards.</li>
    <li> Love the product! Beautiful color, great henna. I was annoyed however that the sender didn&#x27;t use enough postage, so I had to go to the post office to pick it up and pay the balance of postage. A minor inconvenience, but annoying and easily avoidable if the sender had done their job correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I love this henna. It&#x27;s amazing and I always get compliments on the color!</li>
    <li> ^_^ Dyed my kinky hair a nice dark auburn red, the good news is it didn&#x27;t change my hair pattern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOL the bad part is trying to get the Henna out your head. I washed it all out, at least I thought, still got a few particles to go.</li>
    <li> The only henna I will use. All natural and stains perfectly when made with lemon juice. I highly recommend it. I</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Good color and conditioning. Deep moisture trearment needed after since henna dries ur hair out.</li>
    <li> The henna gave me a nice red tint.</li>
    <li> this product is for hair and not for skin. I thought it was the same but it isn&#x27;t. This one has less color and not the right consistency. Its is the best brand but this one is for hair only.</li>
    <li> Made my greys a really nice light auburn. I have got natural afro hair and a lot of grey. I will use this again and again.</li>
    <li> I will not be using this product on my hair.  Instead, I will be throwing it in the garbage.  The wrapping looks like a Jamila product; but this product has no type of ingredients anywhere on the box nor inside the box.  Not sure if I trust that this is real Henna product.</li>
    <li> Good stuff! I will be using again. Left my hair feeling nice and full. Also have a red tint that I love. I recommend.</li>
    <li> I was so dying to try this henna treatment hair mask and I&#x27;m glad I did. I started to wonder what took me so long. The results were very satisfying, a little messy but worth it. There are so many ways to use this henna for added strength, growth and volume. This will be a regular part of my hair regimen.</li>
    <li> Jamila is known as the top brand for getting quality henna. I wouldn&#x27;t trust off brands or unreputable sellers for something that I am putting on others skin, so this was my obvious choice when buying on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to henna art, make sure you do your research first on how to mix it to get the best stain because even if you have a good quality henna, it does nothing if it is not prepared well. Trust me, I wasted a first batch by mixing it with part black coffee part lemon and not letting it sit and it did not stain at all. Round 2: mixed with only lemon juice, sit for 12 hours, add tea tree oil, sit another 12 hours &#x3D; awesome stain.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, no instructions but online helped and I&#x27;ve used henna before. Used it today, the color is pretty consistent with henna. Although it caused more shrinkage than the henna I get here at a local Indian store. Not bad product though, but I prefer the henna I get locally. I would buy again if that supply dries up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this many times and use it for body art on all my clients. The stain turns out well, and the powder itself has always been great quality. I always strain my paste before using it on clients, but for practicing purposes I don&#x27;t strain it and the paste turns out smooth with few lumps. I haven&#x27;t had a single box let me down yet; this is my go-to product.  Can&#x27;t wait for the 2015 crop to be sold here!</li>
    <li> Quick processing...great product!!</li>
    <li> Used it for henna tattoos and it worked nicely.</li>
    <li> I used this henna to cover my grays.  I loved the color it gave me a burnt orange color.  It washes out with ease because of the very fine texture.  I would recommend this product for anyone wanting to cover their grays naturally.</li>
    <li> This henna is so fresh I couldn&#x27;t believe it ! I did the henna and indigo process and my hair came out jet black just like the box colors !</li>
