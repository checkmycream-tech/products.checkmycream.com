<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the first product I ever used to grow some of the hair I lost over the years. I am glad it works like a charm. I used it only once a day instead of two times daily as recommended. I am still surprised by how effective Lipogaine for women is. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> After two months I actually have some new hair (baby hair) growing in where I am applying at the front of my hairline.</li>
    <li> I have been using for the past 6 months, with great results. I also use the shampoo and mix the women&#x27;s sensitive formula with the men&#x27;s product with 5% solution. I use the two (2% and 5% solution) mixed together for the top of my scalp. The mix gives me more rapid results. I use the 2% sensitive formula on my eyebrows and hairline, due to irritation from the 5% because it has PG, propylene glycol. I stopped using it for 3-4 days recently, (just forgot) and lost a few hairline hairs, so I am now using 1 time on top and sides, and twice on eyebrows.  It has made a big difference, my hair had always been fine but very thick. I would not want to go without, I use about a bottle every month. Shampoo has made a big difference too. Next I&#x27;ll try the hair vitamins, I also have been taking 5000 mcg Biotin 1 time daily. I also take a multi vitamin, for over 50. I am 67 years old.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two month and i can see a diference in my hair... its growing faster and i can see baby hair in my fort head...great product better than rogaine for woman!!!!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0037T0YES Lipogaine for Women: Minoxidil Enhanced with Biotin and Vitamin for Thinning Hair Loss / Hair Regrowth Treatment Professionally Formulated Extra Strength Version]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using this product from last 1 month. Initially, I found the shedding was less than what it used to be. But now I found so many baby hairs falling out still 10 to 20 hairs falling out. Its not that extreme but I already have visible thinning so, I am worried. Still I ordered two more bottles to try. I heard the shedding is good sign as soon there will be new thicker and stronger hair. I want to know if someone experienced good results after some shedding as I just came across the reviews talking about shedding phase. I will appreciate any help from Lipogaine providers or customer on this.Thanks!</li>
    <li> I did notice some growth but it was very little.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple weeks now , along with \\&quot;careprost\\&quot; ( generic for latisse )used for eyelash growth. I am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now and the difference is drastic.  My thinning hair is now back to the fullness I used to have.  I recommend this to any woman with thinning hair or hair loss.  I use it all over my head, not just on thinning spots as my hair was thinning all over.</li>
    <li> seems to be working as directed.  thanks</li>
    <li> This is really a brilliant product. Not only it grows hair but also makes my hair shinny and healthy. I and some of my friends are using this product for some time. None of we are even remotely disappointed but satisfied to the fullest with the regrowth.This product worthy every penny. It is hard to believe the results until I see it.</li>
    <li> Lipogaine really works.  It does take awhile so stick with it.  It took me six months to see some results; very thin hairs appeared at the last place I lost hair.  Where I lost hair first took about nine months to see results.&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to apply and only takes one minute.  One ml does cover a large amount scalp.  $20 a month is well worth this product because it really does work.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin so I haven&#x27;t tried that Lipogaine.</li>
    <li> I have been using minoxidil products for over 20 years off and on. The last 10 years all the time. I ordered this product by a fluke  when I couldn&#x27;t find my product and the price was good. I have never written a review before, but felt I had to this time. I&#x27;ve had a few spine surgeries through the years, and my hair loves to react to the general... It falls out! Especially around my hairline.Since using this product I have new \\&quot;babies\\&quot; as I call them, about 1/2 inch long. I&#x27;m amazed at how much is there. It has never been like this before, and even if they don&#x27;t grow the full length of my hair, which has never happened before, they fill it in like I can&#x27;t believe, and are so much stronger! I can actually push them to the side. With the results I have after almost 3 months of use  maybe they will grow long. Thank you guys, and please keep making it this way!! Lori</li>
    <li> This a great product, I have been using it for years and am very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t have a sticky residue either.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
    <li> MY THIN SPOTS ON MY HAIR ARE FADEING AWAY BY USING THIS  PRODUCT</li>
    <li> So far I haven&#x27;t noticed a change, but I have only been using it for about 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I could not use for more than 3 weeks, it cause a great deal of itching and dried out my scalp. I would not recommend for people who have a dry scalp... It says you should use for 3 months to see results, so if you don’t experience itching and dryness it just might help re grow hair</li>
    <li> I returned the product because my doctor said it was not FDA approved.</li>
    <li> Thus product dried my hair out and I didn&#x27;t see a difference and my hair was still shedding.</li>
    <li> Started using this product 2 months ago. After about 6 weeks I could see some new hair growing in. I also saw fewer lost hair from brushing. I do color my hair every 6 weeks to cover gray. This has also dried my hair and made it brittle. My hair is naturally fine and thin, so to see some new growth coming in is great. I use this product after washing in the morning and before I go to bed at night. It doesn&#x27;t give any odor or texture change. Easy scalp treatment that actually good for my hair. I do use the Lipogaine shampoo, as well.</li>
    <li> This product really works. I am african american and have thinning edges, due to stress and genetics. When used regularly edges did grow back. Not completely full yet but I can see a difference. You just need to be patient. Ive tried home renedies and black castrol oil nothing worked like this. Didnt give 5 stars yet, I am waiting to see if the bald edges completely fillout. When I miss a week havent noticed new growth falling out which is as plus!</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t work at all and burn my scalp</li>
    <li> Wow!  I am a 68 yr.  old Black lady and I am starting to loose hair in the crown of my head.  I have tried a lot of products to address this problem without much success.  I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine for approx. 3 weeks and I have already seen some improvement in the &amp;#34;bald&amp;#34; spots visible especially right after a shampoo.  Lipogaine seems to have minimized these spots and appears to immediately fill out the spots upon application.  I will continue to use Lipogaine as a less expensive option to Rogaine which I have used in the past and wasn&#x27;t satisfied due to the resulting dryness of the hair.  Lipogaine must contain some kind of moisturizer or oil because application leaves hair shiny.  I use it in addition to a mousse especially made for curly hair.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that I could use this long term and get the benefit of more hair. After a couple of weeks I got very tired of my hair being sticky from it. I was careful to put it only on the scalp but it still seemed to seep onto the hair and make it sticky. I was having to wash my hair everyday instead of every other day which irritated me. I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to get any benefit from it.</li>
    <li> did not see help. I might need more time</li>
    <li> been using this product for a month, not sure how well it works yet, i noticed some fine hairs growing it the spot along my hair line, i feel like it if i kept using it, ill see better results</li>
    <li> The consistency is this and watery. It does have an alcohol scent when smelled straight from the bottle but I didn&#x27;t smell it when I applied it. The dropper is very easy to use and helps when applying this to your scalp. At first, this made my scalp tingle and burn a little but the sides of my hairline are very sensitive and after a couple of uses, it no longer burned. This would leave a little residue on my hair and made it a little stiff but not too noticeable. The bottle lasts a good amount of time when used about twice a day. There hasn&#x27;t been any irritations or problems from this and I have pretty sensitive scalp. As for this working on my scalp, I did notice little hairs finally growing in those spots where it didn&#x27;t seem to want to grow, so yes, it&#x27;s working for me.</li>
    <li> no problems, great service</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I&#x27;ve had several areas of alopecia and really thin hair from years of relaxer use that never showed signs of improving. I was a little skeptical to try this but figured if I&#x27;ve tried everything else why not give this a shot. To my surprise those areas are improving now with regular application of this product. As a black women I recommend this for other women out there who are curious and desperate for results.</li>
    <li> See new hair but not much its been a month. Don&#x27;t like the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> This product gave me severe  headache after one use, so I discontinued it and requested a refund</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I messed up my hair trying to color it. It was dry brittle and breaking. Lipogaine didn&#x27;t make my hair grow faster, I just grew more of it... Thicker.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m as skeptical as the next person, but Lipogaine definitely works for me. You have to be a little patient and persevering, but over time the results are even better than I hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first couple weeks, I noticed my hair was falling out less. After a couple months, I started really seeing the little hairs of re growth. My hair has become steadily fuller over time -- you can hardly see my scalp on top now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I don&#x27;t think I will ever stop using it. Why have thinning hair when you don&#x27;t have to?</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying a hair growth product and Lipogaine did not disappoint!  I started to have some hair loss around my temples, and this product has encouraged hair regrowth. My roots are growing 2x faster than they normally do and I am very pleased with the rate it&#x27;s growing.  I found it helpful to squeeze the dropper, and drag the glass portion across the scalp while squeezing the bulb directly over the scalp, while going all around areas seeking new growth. This way here, the product doesn&#x27;t drip or leak out of where you want it.  It has a strong chemical smell upon opening, but it fades quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair or scalp smelling bad. It doesn&#x27;t burn, itch or tingle either.  *FTC DISCLAIMER: THIS PRODUCT WAS SENT TO ME COMPLIMENTARY IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW*</li>
    <li> So far, product has not worked; see little or no difference.&lt;br /&gt;At this time,  I cannot recommend. this product.to anyone.</li>
    <li> I had to stop using it after a week because I got itchy all over my body. I gave three stars because it probably works.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been off and on this product for the last year.  I do notice that my hair grows in better.  I have lots of thinning areas and it is frustrating.  However, since taking this product along with the biotin 250mg daily the fullness and healthy shine and look to my hair has been great.  I am not as consistent with the Lipogaine as I should be.  But I try to use it at least 4  - 5t imes a week.  It makes your hair feel a little stiff and dull so that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t use it every day.  I&#x27;m African American and don&#x27;t need to wash my hair daily due to it being oily or having a dirty hair smell.  But if I use this product daily, I would most certainly have to wash my hair 4 times a week.</li>
    <li> I was prepared to wait 3 to 6 months to start seeing results, but new hairs appeared within the first three weeks! I began by using it twice a day as directed and by the time I started my second bottle I switched to once a day before bed. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have slowed progress at all. Update - I have been using Lipogaine for Women everyday for six months and I continue to be delighted with the results! I have lots of new hair! The original new growth is three inches long now and I can still see new baby hairs growing. My hairline is much thicker and I no longer see my scalp shining under the bright bathroom lights. I have recommended Lipogaine to other women in my family and would happily recommend it to anyone who is experiencing hair loss.</li>
    <li> I just started the second bottle. I thought it was going ok but now I have a horrible rash, dryness and excessive itching. I&#x27;m washing my hairline everyday now. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t return the product because  30 days has pass. I will not use this again  and I am skeptical about the sensitive scalp version of this product.</li>
    <li> When you apply this product on your scalp it irritates your eyes. This product makes your hair oily and greasy, it also gives me frontal headaches . I have to admit it does work, just takes time and, you need to purchase more bottles to notice the full effect.</li>
    <li> After constant usage I started seeing new hair growing around my hair line</li>
    <li> I can actually see a difference in my hair. i did not mention anything to my hairdreser about using this product and she commented she can see my hair is filling in.</li>
    <li> I have been using for the past month 1/2 and I don&#x27;t see any results at all - i would not recommending buying this product, It might work on another ethic group of people, not for Blacks.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been three weeks I got fuzz and baby hair.  I&#x27;m so excited.</li>
    <li> made my scalp itch and it did not worked. I used it as directed. It has a strong odor so you are going to have to deal with it. Buy it at your own risk but i do not recomend this product.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see new growth but it does seem to thicken up &amp; give body to thinning areas.  I will keep using.</li>
    <li> I found each time I used this product I got real bad headaches. I can&#x27;t say how effective it is because of the headaches</li>
    <li> Awesome hair loss product that actually works.  I apply twice a day and noticed slow to no hair loss. I recommended the woman&#x27;s version to my mom and she loved it.</li>
    <li> Great product would purchase again would highly recommend to all my family and friends anytime anywhere all over the world</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different brands containing minoxidil, but like this one the best, because it seems not to leave your hair as dry as the others (Walmart, for instance, which is a lot cheaper, but leaves my hair a lot drier). This product works just as effectively as the other brands containing minoxidil, but leaves the luster and moisture in my hair intact!</li>
    <li> I love this product, I lost my hair due to chemotherapy and i started using after a break from my first session, it works great. I started noticing hair within a few weeks of using. I lost hair all over and using this on my scalp, hair is growing there and there only. Did purchase the shampoo also.</li>
    <li> Rotate this between Rogaine for Women. Try 30 days with one and then alternate. I am African American female and under the doctors care was told to try Rogaine for unexplaineable hair loss at the age of 41 beginning at 39. I am totally healthy,(no relaxers or color in about 3 years, just a off black cellaphane by Adore) all blood work came back free from any ailments and i do not consume any type of drug orientated substance including alcohol and have never been prescribed more than 800 Ibuprofen for pain but stress oh yeah no cure that. I was even given PLACEBO shots a year prior which stop the shedding but didnt formulate any new growth. Okay, so after being laid off of work from a stressful job which paid no money any how, my doctors appointment was free from being rescheduled (two weeks later...Yipppy). This time placebo shots, words of encouragement, freedom to wash my hair using Jason Organics Biotin Thickening Shampoo and Avalon Biotin Thickening Conditioner (I have very Fine Hair, slight kink), Rogaine, Lipogaine, my forehead has hair coming around it along with my neck line where a full pony tail used to be(make no mistake my hair was so thin in the crown area my parts look like a train track-wide) I am a patient person who accepts reality but I feel very greatful as my 2 adult daughters and friends tell me my hair is growing back...These products may not work for everybody but they are working for me. I am not putting any tension on my hair, my daughter makes quick weaves for me using a pre-packaged stocking cap, pack of human hair and gentle hair glue...not to my scalp but to the curveture of my head. I use them in place of wigs...cheaper and to my liking. The first couple of weeks I wore a silk scarf every where though they were fashionable they were not me, it has been 3 months and Im okay wearing my natural tress amongst the public.I now feel tingle sensation to my scalp, for over a year i felt nothing.  When i first began to lose my hair really rapidly, I switched to Organic Shampoos and Conditioners for 3 daughters and 2 Grand-girls and organic hair-dress products(their manes are beautiful). Do some research on line Ren-Pure, Jason and Avalon are all good and if you find your scalp dry add JOjoba oil or Grapeseed to any mixture (a lil goes along way). I believe everything happens for a reason, with being laid -off my stress level went down, my time to take care of me became available and I am glowing. Remember \\&quot;Stress\\&quot; is A killer of all lively-hood in one hiccup or another, the key is to try and create a medium(when possible). I hope this review can assist someone. GOD Bless!</li>
    <li> I will give it few months then get back to you on the results. it can be applied very easy.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to replace a similar product recalled by Perfect Image. It worked well, better than straight minoxidil 2% for women. However, right after I started to use this product I developed a severe case of eyelid dermatitis! I did some research and found that can often be caused by hair products, oddly enough. I discontinued using the Lipogaine and the dermatitis cleared right up. I just thought I would put this story here for anyone who might struggle with sensitivity issues. Otherwise, it works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using lipogaine for a month now and i must say the results are amazing! I gave up on using hair treatments for my hairline after the one i was using before was taken off shelves but then i watched a review on youtube and decided to give this a try. My fronthair used to be long and full but after so many weaves started to come off and i started to notice bald patches around my hairline. It was so bad i had to cover my hair up to avoid embarrassments. Since i started using lipogaine my hair is filling up gradually, its not quite how i want it but just a little more patience and more months of using lipogaine and i know i&#x27;ll acheive exactly what i want. For now, i&#x27;m a happy bunny! Will recommend to anyone. Pls give it a try, it works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 24 years old and I started loosing my hair due to an adverse reaction to birth control (Gildess, if you&#x27;re curious).  My hair went from normal to falling out by the handful literally overnight!  I bought Lipogaine because of the good reviews, and because propylene glycol was listed last on the ingredient list here on Amazon.  I was a little disappointed to see that it was the second ingredient, the first being ethanol, but decided to use it anyway because I was desperate.  While my hair loss stopped after 2 days of use, I also got a majorly itchy red rash everywhere it came in to contact.  This includes where it ran down my neck, back, and face while washing it out in the shower.  I decided to just go for Rogaine foam, because it doesn&#x27;t have PPG, and haven&#x27;t had any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LONG STORY SHORT: It&#x27;s really effective for OC induced hairloss (telogen efflevium), but avoid it if you have sensitive skin or are allergic to PPG.</li>
    <li> No real miracles but I have seen some regrowth.  Like all these products though once you stop using it all the new hair you got back falls out.  I would not recommend this unless you have the money to buy it all the time.</li>
    <li> After completing my first bottle of Lipogaine, I noticed new hairs in the bald area at the top center of my scalp. I continued using the product, applying it twice daily and massaging it in, and now I have to search for the area that was completely bald.  I haven&#x27;t kept track of exactly when I began using the product, but it&#x27;s been at least six months.  I am shocked that it actually works, because so many products make false claims.  I started out using the full dosage but have been using half of that for a month or so, because my hair has filled in nicely.  I plan to continue with my regimen for maintenance, because the bald area was so sickening to look at!</li>
    <li> After using Lipogaine as directed, it did not work for me.  There was no visable difference in my hair growth.</li>
    <li> This really works. I saw improvement right away. I used cayenne hair oil n use them every few days. It filled in the thinning spot within weeks.my hair looks thicker. Great product.</li>
    <li> At first I gave this a good review after using it 4 weeks or so. Now I regret buying this product! After using it for about 6 weeks I noticed that my hair was thinning in the areas where I was applying the product. I also noticed that I was getting grey hair in the area I continuously applied the lipogaine and only in that area. I&#x27;m 28 and had zero grey hair pior to using the product nor does my family have a history of hair loss or grey hair at a young age. I just wanted my hair to get a bit thicker and grow a little faster. I should have been content with my hair as it was instead of ever buying this product!!!</li>
    <li> OK, I&#x27;ve had fine, limp hair all my life and, now in my 70s it is finer and limper than ever. I used to color it just for the added body, but I don&#x27;t like hair dye, and gave that up years ago. My hair is still almost all brown, with gray at the temples and a few scattered throughout - I wear it very short - I hate to mess with it, so I just finger fluff after a shampoo and run with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every place I have ever lived, I put a mirror on the bathroom wall opposite the medicine cabinet - that way all I have to do is adjust the mirrored cabinet door slightly for a simultaneous front and rear view of my hair. So I am quite familiar with my cowlick and the scalp showing at the crown. Much of my finger fluffing has to do with spreading the existing hair around that area for camouflage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure really how I came across this product, but it looked interesting and I thought I&#x27;d try it. It arrived only a few days ago, and I do realize that it will be several weeks before I might notice any new hair - or that it might not happen at all. However, I wanted to give it a 4-star review right away, simply because I like the texture of my hair when I am using this. It may be my imagination, but the hair strands themselves actually feel and look fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not sure how to use it or how much - for some reason I had the idea that the recommendation was a couple of drops, but the Amazon description does say use &amp;#34;up to 1mL&amp;#34; twice a day - ah, so that&#x27;s why it comes with a calibrated dropper. So then I tried dropping it into the palm of my hands, rubbing them together and then distributing it all over my head - but I thought that can&#x27;t be right because a lot of that never made it to my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One problem area I have is right at my hairline, where a small skin cancer was cut out of my forehead, leaving a nickel-size depression in my scalp that has no hair. I don&#x27;t like it. My hair doesn&#x27;t know where to part any more. Anyway, I got the bright idea to use the dropper itself as the applicator, and I dot little droplets from it onto my scalp at appropriate areas, including the hairline and that darned hole. THEN I use my fingertips to vigorously massage my head to work all of the product into my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have hopes that my hair will actually thicken with new growth, and if it does, I will have to put this product on a subscription order, because I won&#x27;t ever want to be without it. Meanwhile, though, it is perfectly satisfactory as a hair dressing for styling my hair and camoflaging the thin spot on top.</li>
    <li> My mother started to loose much of her after back surgery last fall. I started doing research on various products on the markets and stumbled on this  product on Amazon. I have been ordering it and shipping it for her for the past 6 months and she has since regained 50% of her lost hair. She keeps asking me to send her more even before she finishes what she has.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my little sister. It does help, it brings out little baby hairs as I call them to the applied areas after so long of use. But we were looking for something that will thicken the length of her hair. She has very long hair almost to her butt and it has been thinning badly. Her scalp is fine though, we need something for her length to get fuller again. It&#x27;ll take years if we have to wait on those baby hairs to grow. But if you are looking for something to thicken the hair on your scalp then it will work best for you.</li>
    <li> After two pregnancies I&#x27;ve been having issues with my hair thinning it just seems to fall out afterwards! I had been hating my hair for a while now but it&#x27;s finally come back to life and I&#x27;m loving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product for exactly 30 days to the day today! What happened made me very very happy to say the least. My hair looks amazing if I do say so myself. My husband has on two occasions said &amp;#34;What did you do to your hair today it looks so nice?&amp;#34; Well, I&#x27;ll tell you what I did, I woke up rolled out of bed and did not put it up in a pony tail because I couldn&#x27;t find one and my 2 year old was running around like a crazy little person trying to find something to entertain himself with and I had no time to find a pony tail. So, that was nice to hear haha. He now will say I have amazing don&#x27;t need to do anything wake up out of bed looking awesome hair! It&#x27;s kind of great due to my recent not liking my hair anymore. I am starting to truly love my hair again like I used to and it&#x27;s not even dyed, or stylishly cut or full of products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free product for a review. My opinions are 100% honest and my own.**</li>
    <li> I could tell no difference in this product and the Rogaine I buy at the drug store. It is thicker so I like the Rogaine better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had thinning hair for several years.  It&#x27;s a family trait unfortunately.  I read the reviews and having been using it for about 4 weeks.  I think it&#x27;s working although I can&#x27;t say that I see a lot of new hair growth.  I think I see some but I have a way to go.  I&#x27;m going to try it for 6 months and make a final decision.  The product has NO odor.  The liquid  is very thin so I have to be careful to keep my head tilted back so it doesn&#x27;t run down my forehead.  I find it a little difficult to apply while looking in a mirror because I have to tilt my head forward to see the top of my head but that makes it run down my forehead.  It would be ideal if you had someone who could put it on for you.  I use it in the morning before I put any other products in my hair and style as usual.  Then again when I get home or before bed.&lt;br /&gt;March 24 2013 Update:  I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle of Lipogaine and I&#x27;m convinced it is filling in the thinning area.  My hair is definitely not \\&quot;see through\\&quot; in the trouble spots.  I think it&#x27;s made my hair fuller and I will continue to use this product.  I find it to be an exceptional value for what it does.  I had earlier said that it was very thin liquid and tends to run.  I&#x27;ve started catching the runs with a Q-Tip and redistribute it so I don&#x27;t waste any. I use it every night and everyday I look forward to styling hair because it looks better than it did three months ago.  I would recommend it to anyone who is concerned about thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I have used other brand (Nioxin) that it has 2% minoxidil, and I have seen results, however with this brand, my hair stayed “dirty”, head was itching and not notice any change. I think it is a bad product. I don´t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have faith in this product upon reading search results / comparisons to similar products, and the many reviews of those people who have positive results using it. I hoped this product would result with the desired effect of growing back thinning hair at my temples. However, I was unable to use it. Caused severe burning, itching, redness, welting and scabbing to my scalp. May be due to an allergic reaction; I have had radical chemotherapy (years ago), so that may also be a factor. Also note that where I placed drops of the product the hair became stiffened as if sugar water. Skepticism had me wondering how to be certain such products are made of viable ingredients, vs a &#x27;snake-oil&#x27; treatment of sugar-water and odorous chemical, and organic compounds such as hydrogen peroxide, ethyl alcohol. . . and do some people get real stuff while others receive some weird placebo. Doubtful. Just felt better entertaining myself while realizing I wasted the money on this product that evidently my body rejects. So, my review is not so much a negative of the product - just caring advice if you are hypersensitive to chemicals. It should come with a warning, if it did my mistake for not seeing it.</li>
    <li> Good product easy to use and has a nice smell. only down fall is ya cant stop using it. I got this for a trial rate thanks Lipogaine.</li>
    <li> I like it some what, but when I received the bottle of Lipogaine it only had a little bit in the bottle most of it leak out.</li>
    <li> Although I only tried this product once I dont think I will order it again I could&#x27;t see any results.Will not oder again.</li>
    <li> I will let you know later. It takes 3 months.i have used it twice a day so far, as instructed.</li>
    <li> i have been using the product for a few weeks,  my son is seeing a difference and my husband wants some to.</li>
    <li> My thinning hair has thickened significantly.  I love it! I was hesitant, I didn&#x27;t think it would work, but my hair looks very nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine for about 2 years now.  My hair has always been very thin and I&#x27;ve tried a number of different things to try and prevent the rapid hair loss that I began to experience about 15 years ago.  While I&#x27;ve not experienced any over-the-top regrowth, I can say that using topical minoxidil treatments has definitely helped.  My hair still falls out, but not nearly as much as it did prior to using minoxidil products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One very important thing that I&#x27;ve come to realize with this type of product is that it takes several MONTHS of regular use before there is a noticeable difference.  I did a fair amount of research on the different hair-loss products available and read tons of reviews.  Most of the negative reviews I read are posted by individuals with high expectations that their hair would miraculously grow back overnight, which is definitely not the case.  It took a good 2- to 3-months before I noticed any improvement.  Eventually the patches on my scalp became less noticeable and I was able to see new growth coming in under the existing hair.  On the downside, I&#x27;ve forgotten my Lipogaine at home on a vacation or two and did experience hair loss at a fairly rapid rate for a few weeks after.  Nothing too serious, but initally alarming nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair every other day and use Lipogaine every day.  I am happy with the results, especially when considering what that the alternative could be.  I&#x27;ve not had to resort to wigs, I&#x27;ve actually had a number of people comment that my hair looks fuller and healthier than it ever has.  I&#x27;ve recommended Lipogaine to several family members and friends as well.  It&#x27;s not a miracle product, but it does works if you are willing to accept that it takes time for results and commit to using it until someone is able to concoct that miracle product that we thin-haired people so desperately desire.</li>
    <li> leaves my hair sticky.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as they claim.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works and works really well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also started taking Biotin 5000 recommended by my dermatologist. I started seeing hair growth that was very healthy. I haven&#x27;t had any negative side effects at all, so i&#x27;m amazed at its effects and the quick speed as which i saw the difference! It has been a few months and I am so happy I have a thick full head of hair!</li>
    <li> I have tried quite a few products to try to make my hair fuller. This delivers the best result.  Thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m probably not the best person to gauge this product&#x27;s effectiveness because I only used one bottle.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a huge amount of hair growth but have noticed some fuzz in balding areas. Instructions say it may take up to six months so I will continue using it. I may have a better rating after the six months.</li>
    <li> I made the decision to stop coloring my hair and embrace my silver hair. Since I&#x27;m also very impatient so I cut it very short. As in shorter than Jamie Lee Curtis hair cut short. That was not quite enough so I added Lipogaine and Hair Covet also from Hair Skin Professional.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these two products together for a full month and I have to say I am AMAZED at how much growth I can see. I have so much silver showing now I&#x27;m amazed!!! My hair is fuller, thicker and growing so fast!!!! Even my hairdresser commented on how fast my hair is growing!!&lt;br /&gt;To use just move the dropper around on your scalp, then massage into the scalp. Do this twice a day; once when I wake up and once before bed. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent and by the time it dries it has no scent.&lt;br /&gt;This one bottle will last for a full month and two doses a day.&lt;br /&gt;This didn&#x27;t effect the color treated portion of my hair,but if I was still coloring my hair I&#x27;d would say I am WELL past the need a touch up phase!&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled with this product and so thankful I was given a bottle to try for the purpose of this review.</li>
    <li> Definitely see a difference after a few months and you do have to keep using it.  My hair is not as thi k as it used to be but it is much much better.  I have purchased 4 bottles.</li>
    <li> It adversely affects the condition of my hair.  can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> This product worked better for me than Rogaine for women. It takes 2 to 3 months to see any results.</li>
    <li> My hair is getting thicker after 1 months</li>
    <li> used it for four weeks... no results...don&#x27;t know how long it should be used for in order to get results... six months? a year?  would like the manufacturer to give some indication of averages... how long before results....what average of people get results, what average do not...</li>
    <li> Give it time--like being consistent with the application for at least 3 months.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months now, and there is a dramatic difference.  Use with Nioxin #4 shampoo.  It does work--and my girlfriends notice--even with color treated hair.</li>
    <li> Started using this product Nov. 2013.  At about the 4 month mark I noticed that there was much less hair on my bathroom floor and in the shower.  I never told my hairdresser that I was using anything to see if she would notice.  At about the 6 month mark she looked at me and said &amp;#34;It is like your hair is brand new again.  What have you been doing?&amp;#34; It is soft and all the natural curl was back.  I no longer feel like I am trying to cover bald spots.  I had gone to a dermatologist a couple of years back for hair loss.  He had me on a prescription that was alcohol based.  It smelled like alcohol and whenever I would get my hair colored, my scalp would burn.  I stopped using that product.  I still get my hair colored every 6 weeks and I have no burning sensation or adverse effects with the Lipogaine.  I usually do not use it the day I get my hair colored.  I am extremely satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> I am finishing up my third bottle.  As some have stated, it has stopped the hair from constantly shedding.  I am beginning to get regrowth in the front hairline (where it was thinning).  I followed someone on Amazon&#x27;s advise and as I applied, I would rub the product into my hair.  My son read that the Lipogaine can get into your blood stream (when rubbing into your scalp) and make hair grow in places that you do not want hair!!  So, I bought disposable gloves to continue the full rub in. I plan to use this for at least a year and see how things progress. I am not sure if this hair loss was stress related or aging.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used regular Rogaine for years but I saw this product on Amazon and decided to give it a try. It itches the scalp quite a bit, especially in the first week or two, and it&#x27;s thicker than regular Rogaine so your hair gets greasy and you need to wash it more often. But my hair looks fluffier, fuller  and healthier.</li>
    <li> I have been using Lipogaine since December 2013 on my thinning hair.  I use it as directed by applying it twice daily.  I love how it gives my hair that extra body and shine.  Over the years I have had very bad hair loss on the crown of my head and this has helped me tremendously.  I am unable to take many vitamins in pill form because of some allergies I have so this liquid form straight on my scalp has been excellent for me.  I really don&#x27;t know what I would be using by now, (probably a wig) if I didn&#x27;t have Lipogaine.  Thank you for creating such a nice product and gentle on my scalp.  I be continuing to use this as I am a very happy customer!</li>
    <li> I choose this rating because I did get to see results with my hair texture. You need to use this everyday.</li>
    <li> have been using for almost a month, so still too soon to say. Will update later.</li>
    <li> I have been using Lipogaine since September of 2013 and have re-ordered it a total of 13 times since then. The difference in my hair growth is nothing less than dramatic. In a little less than a year and a half I went from profuse thinning - from the point where I had to wear hats to both protect my scalp from the sun and to cover it up from embarrassment - to where I am now consistently complimented on my hair - no small feat for a 50+ year old woman. I feel the added DHT-blocker along with the biotin and vitamins B6 and B12 have really made a difference in the quality of my hair regrowth. I continue to use this product and have high hopes that Lipogaine will soon come out with a 5% minoxidil solution for women as that has now been approved. Definitely worked for me. Highly recommend you give it a dedicated 4-month try.</li>
    <li> Not bad but really drying to the scalp.</li>
    <li> Still in box, need to return because of warning on box.</li>
    <li> I have been using Lipogaine for Women for over two months and have seen numerous baby hair sprouting on my hairline. Have noticed less hair fallout on the floor as well.  Overall I&#x27;d say my hair feels thicker and has been growing faster than average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is that my hair tends to feel a bit stiffer and gummy at the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely continue using this product and would recommend it as well.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had it for to long don&#x27;t know if its working</li>
    <li> 30 days and my hair has gotten thinner and thinner.  I am going back to Folicure sold at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 7 weeks for thin hair acquired from a medication I took 7 years ago. I also am using a \\&quot;hair and nail\\&quot; vitamin (Nioxin brand) and a women&#x27;s multivitamin with iron every 3rd day as my iron runs low. I began to see a few hairs after 5-6 weeks but it was difficult as my white roots were showing and my scalp is very pale. After seeing my stylist for my usual color, he also saw them and was able to show them to me. After coloring I can&#x27;t say they are making a big difference yet, but hey, they are only 1/4 inch or so! I am so encourage though it is really working! I only gave it 4 stars for these CONS: 1) It takes committment to apply it twice a day, every day (I missed maybe 2-3 evening applications over 7 weeks) and 2) It makes my hair stiff and a little clumpy, especially my bangs, like when you use too much hair spray. So I wash my dry, fine hair more often, 2-3 times a week instead of once every 6-7 days. I am very allergic/rashy and very sensitive to smells, and this product has NO smell, even after heavy perspiration and except for a little tingling the 1st or 2nd applications I have had no adverse scalp reactions. I am also an MD, and if you are experiencing sudden hair loss for the first time, please see your doctor to rule out low thyroid function, vitamin deficiencies (B vitamins, Iron, and vitamin D can all affect hair and nails) and to rule out any other serious medical reason for hair loss.</li>
    <li> The dropper used to apply is glass and I didn&#x27;t notice until the first time I tried it that it was broken. I poked myself! I replaced it with one I had and will continue to use the product. Delivery was quick but I cannot comment on efficacy since it indicates it takes 12 weeks before you will see results.</li>
    <li> I have been SO pleased with the results from this product.  Its easy to apply and works like magic if you stick to the twice a day applications.  I noticed results in about 3 weeks - most noticeably in the amount of hair I was losing during washings.  Prior to using Lipogaine, I would get handfuls of hair coming out.  I will say, however, you can&#x27;t stop using it unless you want to go back to thinning hair.  My results were so great that I thought I could just apply once a day and that was not the case.  My hairdresser has been so blown away with my new head of hair!  I would recommend this product to anyone who has thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I tried this just to support growing my hair out, but found after just a few days of using as recommended that I was very short of breath. It felt as if my lungs could only fill halfway up. I am a healthy 24 year old (and opera singer), and all of a sudden, feel as if my childhood asthma is back in full force. I&#x27;m hoping this goes away soon. I guess this is the price for my vanity!</li>
    <li> Applied in my scalp for the first time last night. Two minutes later I start feeling a headache. I could actually feel the pain spreading through the sides of my head. Scary. I washed my head and realized how crazy is to buy medication online without knowing exactly how legit the product it or how safe the formula is. Especially for something so close to your brain, you don&#x27;t want anything messing up with your veins/circulation in that area. Perspective, people!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 50 year old woman, and my hair started falling out due to my thyroid slowing down.  Luckily I had thick hair, so I&#x27;m not totally bald yet, but I&#x27;m sure you ladies out there can understand why going bald for us is unacceptable - unless of course, we want to be bald!  Bald men are very attractive, but for me? Uh uh, no way.  So I figured I&#x27;ve give this a try... nothing to lose, right?  Years ago, I used a shampoo that regrew hair after I had brain surgery, and that worked beautifully, but that particular product changed it&#x27;s ingredients, and it doesn&#x27;t work anymore. Bummer!  But I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks, and my hair is no longer falling out!  I haven&#x27;t seen any regrowth yet, but I&#x27;m guessing that takes awhile... if that happens, I will change my review to 5 stars for sure.  The problem is that the bottle is small and a little expensive, so it&#x27;s almost empty already - BUT if my hair grows back, it will be worth it.</li>
    <li> This product along with the Nutri Ox shampoo works just fine...</li>
    <li> Because I&#x27;ve used rogain for so many years I thought I&#x27;d try this.  I&#x27;ve only used it for a month but I think my hair is thicker and growing more baby hairs.  I might take the advise of another reviewer and switch each month.  This is a little thicker than the watery Rogain, but I like it much better this way.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I developed a rash.  Minoxidil usually does make my scalp itch, but I still can  use it. This made more than my scalp itch.</li>
    <li> As a mid-aged woman, nothing is more aggravating than loosing hair. Ladies love our hair, and nothing feels better than cutting off some split ends. But how can you do that when your hair is falling out?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given this product a five star review, simply because it works with a charm. It didn&#x27;t take long for me to notice the effects, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier about it. I finally have my hair back! I would recommend this product to anyone with a doubtfulthought about their hair.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> It seemed to work a little but caused my scalp to itch a bit and left residue over a few uses.</li>
    <li> The product is thick enough to spread well, however, it&#x27;s yellow-ish color made my gray hair yellow.  Better for darker hair.</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to receiving this product especially after reading all the positive reviews. And since I really didn&#x27;t have a big problem with hair loss ( onlg a small section in my temple region) I thought it would fix the problem, or I would at least see SOME KIND of growth. However, to my disappoint this product did not provide me any. It actually caused mild irratation to my eye, which to me was really strange since I didn&#x27;t touch my eye with the product.My left eye bothered me right after i applied it, so shortly after I started to apply the product in a well ventilated area and I&#x27;ve had no problems since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I applied this product religiously for a little over a month, and I feel that if you have a guarantee for a month then I should so some results in a month! no matter how small. They also lied about the ingredient order, here is the REAL ingredient order: ETHANOL, propylene glycol, water, minoxidil (2%) , azelaic acid, retinol, apple polyphenol, niacin, biotin, adenosine, vitamin B6 and B12 phophotidycholine. And to make matters worse, when I tried to contact them about a refund I can&#x27;t get a response, so currently I&#x27;ve filed a claim with amazon to get my money back because i&#x27;m NOT satified. &gt;:/</li>
    <li> After 2 weeks of continual use I noticed that my hair started to fall more than ever although in the first few applications it seemed to be working, this product is not for me and also started to make my scalp feel itchy a few days ago. I will not use it again!</li>
    <li> Absolutely brilliant! I was very skeptical at first, considering the proliferation of hair-loss products across the market. Already with a thinning hairline at 31, I was anxious about buying something with the real possibility it would fail. IT DIDN&#x27;T! I started to see a marked improvement after roughly three months of dedicated use. I&#x27;ve tapered off since then, but am thoroughly sold! This will be a permanent part of my regimen. TWO THUMBS UP!</li>
    <li> When i purchased this product it did not say that you should not take it if you have High blood pressure.  Once i received it and read the directions i realized this was something that i could not use.. Too bad i had already placed the order because this was a waist of my $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product for hair loss problems. I have been dealing with hair loss issues and have noticed thinning areas of hair. This product is easy to use and has not caused me side effects. I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in hair loss since using the product, and it appears that new hair may be growing in already as well. Overall, I recommend this easy to use and convenient hair loss product. Hope it can work for others like it has worked for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks, I noticed nothing in terms of new hair but I guess it needs a time to see any result. however, after a week of using this on my scalp I noticed some dandruff which tells me that it will work because I have an oily scalp and this maybe drying it in order to grow new hair.</li>
    <li> I thought I was allergic to Minoxidil until I used this. This formula didn&#x27;t cause scalp irritation or itchiness. I would purchase this if you have sensitive skin, but would go with a generic brand if your scalp can stand it.</li>
    <li> I have tried this product for a while by now but it has a very strong smells and it really irritates my scalp and I tried to use it not as often as it directed on the bottle but it is rather greasy and makes my hair looked and smell funny :(</li>
    <li> Not effective for me.after the use of 2 bottles. First lots of shedding then less but no new hair growth.</li>
    <li> I used it for a month and made my hairline really really itchy!  I did not see a single strand of new hair at all.  This gave me breakouts in my forehead area.  I complied with the twice a day every 8 hours application but it just made my hairline super duper mega to the max itchy!  Will try the hypoallergenic one.  Hmmm.. maybe I should file for a refund.</li>
    <li> Lipogaine Works&lt;br /&gt;Good job!&lt;br /&gt;Increased fullness of hair. Easy applicator. Each bottle lasts about 1 month.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to others with hair loss.</li>
    <li> In my fifties, I&#x27;m losing my hair for few years and worried me to death.  My dermatologist told me to us 5% Regaine a year ago.  I used Costco brand of Minoxidil.  Finished 2 bottles, one day, I noticed that I may have a bit more facial hair.  I stopped the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair losing, sometime good and sometime bad while I was dealing with my anemia. After fix the anemic problem.  I was searching for a product for stopping the abnormal hair lose.  This product has so my good reviews, so I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When product arrived.  the label was a sticker not printed.(?)  the sticker had wrinkle.  This brought my suspicion of the quality control of this product. I did further research on this product and realized that it is not a FDA approved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hesitated a while but still applied it for 2 weeks.  my hair loss not less but increased.  I don&#x27;t care if someone may say it will start with increase then reduce eventfully.  I just don&#x27;t want to take any risk on my hair even it claimed of having DHT blocker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, I went to buy Regaine for woman (2%), it has been 3 weeks now.  Hair lose seems less.  I will continue to use Reaine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product.  If it is a such good product, the company should apply FDA approval and make sure the quality control on every detail including the content and the package.  For a consumer, we cannot tell what is inside the bottle but by judging what is visible.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!! It works!!!! I had lots of baby hairs grow back after applying it to the front part of my head. I had done some cornrows back to back and my front hairs by my hairline thinned out and fell out. My hair looks great now. I told my hairdresser about this &amp; she wants to check it out and possibly offer it for sale in her salon. Will definitely buy at least 1 more. I want my hair to return to its full state prior to all those cornrows.</li>
    <li> Used it for more than eight months. All I noticed was a yellow streak in my hair.</li>
    <li> I have extreme problem hair so not sure if it works or not!&lt;br /&gt;It does seem like a good product.&lt;br /&gt;Gail</li>
    <li> I have used for 2 months and I have not seen any results.  Others said that this had worked for them and to be patient, but I didn&#x27;t notice any change.  IDK if I didn&#x27;t use long enough to see results, but I didn&#x27;t see any.</li>
    <li> Thé product really really Work!!!!</li>
    <li> Lipogaine made my head itch unbearably; I was constantly scratching, rubbing, tapping my scalp.  I even created 2-3 WOUNDS in my scalp because of how bad my head itched, which is definitely not conducive to hair growth.  Even still, I wasn&#x27;t going to waste the 40 dollars I had spent and I used up the 2 bottles that I had purchased.  Needless to say, I have less hair now than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take this review with a grain of salt; I am fairly certain that after using minoxidil liquids for years that I likely developed an allergy to the vehicle (apparently it&#x27;s propylene glycol).  If you are currently using a minoxidil liquid and do not have any itch at all, then you should give this product a try based on the other positive reviews.  As for me, I have to use minoxidil foam.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t be harsh on the product despite the fact it didn&#x27;t work for me after two full bottles.  Usually, I buy a brand of minoxidil at one store, but they remodeled the store and did not have it for months, so I tried this because it sounded like the biotin and vitamins would be good along with the minoxidil.  My personal experience:  Most of us know it takes 30 days for minoxidil to work, so I gave it an extra 30 days, and it just didn&#x27;t stop my hair from coming out.  It also made my very fine hair stiff and sticky, which actually made things worse, so it seemed anyway.  The store started stocking the store brand of minoxidil again, and my hair stopped falling out finally.  I&#x27;m glad, as I was without it for six months and my hair is half as thick as it was before.  Now I am going to see if they will give a refund for the extra four bottles I bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair loss is such a tricky endeavor, and there are so many reasons for it, who&#x27;s to say this product won&#x27;t work for someone else....</li>
    <li> This product has helped me slow the thinning that I have had at my widening part. I wish that it came in a different form, however, because, on days that I don&#x27;t wash and style my hair, applying the product messes up my hair a bit and makes it a little stiff and tacky.  That said, the only other form I&#x27;ve ever seen is foam (for men&#x27;s Rogaine products, for example), which probably isn&#x27;t any better.</li>
    <li> I switched to this product after my favorite minoxidil product was discontinued. Unfortunately, while this contains all the same active ingredients I am used to, it also includes a whole bunch more which make this product stink. It smells like a weird chemical mix on your head which others around you can smell for 10-12 feet in every direction. I am very disappointed, especially as the product description claims this product has no smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used monoxidil on and off for many years.  Because monoxidil is almost always suspended in alcohol, it always dries out your scalp and hair.  This product intensifies that problem and caused me to lose more hair.  It may work better than regular monoxidil but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m willing to have more of my very thin hair crack off.</li>
    <li> Only used a week.  Too much trouble.</li>
    <li> helped hair would buy again from seller</li>
    <li> If you look at the list of items in this product in the ad, it does not mention ethanol; however, that is the very first item, which means it makes up the largest portion of the product.  Ethanol is bad for your hair, which I confirmed at other websites.  And yes, this product does smell bad.  Hate it.</li>
    <li> Ive been using the product for 2 months now.  I have noticed new growth in two areas.  I dont how it makes my hair feel. It can look greasy.</li>
    <li> I thought it was supposed to be foam and it is not</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t use this product.  Caused a bad break out on my scalp and every where it touched for even a moment.  Just want to advise people to use it only according to directions and watch out for reactions!</li>
    <li> I think there are new baby hairs growing where I put the lipogaine. So Im gonna order another bottle soon.</li>
    <li> I believe I have to use this for a longer period of time, as to this point I have not noticed any difference.  Need to buy another bottle, and maybe after a couple months I will notice some hair growth.  Will post again later.</li>
    <li> Seems to work but smells and the hair is heavy with product until washed.  Stopped using it.</li>
    <li> I use this product with Hair Covet vitamin. It works great for me. I lost a lot of hair after I had my baby. I took some biotin and One-A-Day multi-vitamin without much result. I saw significant improvement after I use lipogaine for women together with Hair Covet vitamin for three months. Now my hair looks almost the same as before my pregnancy.</li>
    <li> Product say&#x27;s you may see results in 3 months, What?????? I&#x27;ve seen results in 3 weeks.  I try to use as described&lt;br /&gt;but with my super busy schedual I miss here and there.  I can&#x27;t say I see new growth yet, but my existing hair around&lt;br /&gt;the application is growing like crazy, actually thicker.  I am super pleased with the results so far and Im a new user.&lt;br /&gt;Getting ready to order more on Friday.</li>
    <li> I am a 58 year old asian woman and I have long dark hair.  I&#x27;ve been having trouble with thinning hair and hair falling out.  I&#x27;ve used this product for almost two years and I can tell it works.  I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m getting more hair but my hair is thicker and there are now small hairs on my forehead hairline which makes it look like I have more hair.  I&#x27;ve also been putting it on my eyebrows and it&#x27;s definitely working on my eyebrows!  So I highly recommend this for women who are having menopause.  I&#x27;ve also been taking Viviscal along with it and the two work well together.</li>
    <li> Makes my scalp itch.  Cannot use it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving 5 stars in advance of seeing any results since I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks.  I really shouldn&#x27;t see any results for 4-6 months.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any side effects or burning like others say they&#x27;ve experienced.  I use a cotton ball to apply it because it dripped down my forehead with just the dropper...the cotton ball gets it just where I need it, then I massage it into my scalp.  I wash my hands immediately after using it.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy, so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with styling.  I like that the Lipogaine has the Biotin and other vitamins unlike other brands. Looking forward to my hair filling in!</li>
    <li> I have been experiencing hair loss for the last 15 years, and because I was blessed early on with a thick head of hair, my worries were minimal.  A good thing never lasts and in the last 5 years, my part became wider and more of my scalp was visible.  I did a lot of research and tried several different products.  I found one that was effective, but was soon discontinued.  I finally found Lipogaine for Women, and have been using this product for the past year.  I&#x27;m not sure if this product helps with my hair growth or slows down my hair loss.  Either way, I believe the biotin &amp; vitamins enhance the 2% minoxidil and Lipogaine has become an integral part of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered this product after using another minoxidil product for 6 months.  I can&#x27;t say anything negative about the other product, I did see some very positive results from it.  I&#x27;ve been using the Lipogaine for about a month now and I do believe that Lipogaine is superior to the other product.  At the same time that I started using Lipogaine, I also began taking a new multivitamin that promotes healthier nails and hair that I&#x27;ve been taking daily (the vitamins contain biotin too) and, though I was not taking these specific supplements with the other minoxidil product, I have been taking a supplement that contained biotin for just as long as I&#x27;d been using the other minoxidil product.  During the 6 months of using the other minoxidil product, I did see a significant difference on one side of my hairline than the other.  Now that I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine, I can see that the side with less progress is improving a lot.  I know that there are people who believe and say that you don&#x27;t see results in such a short period of time, but I have.  I&#x27;ve been taking pictures since the start of using minoxidil on my thin edges so I know my eyes are not deceiving me.  I have never had any shedding, burning, itching, or any other negative side effects.  Please remember that results vary in individuals but if you think other minoxidil products aren&#x27;t working as well, I would suggest that you try Lipogaine!  It could be the DHT blocker that makes it superior to other minoxidil products.  I know that Lipogaine is definitely what I plan to continue using.</li>
    <li> I started using this product because my hair was shedding more than usual. I already had fine, thinning hair, so any extra hair loss was freaking me out. I am 57 year old female and do not know exact reason my hair was falling out, I contributed it mostly to a recent weight loss and stress. I researched hair loss in women and this is how I found Lipogaine. Along with taking supplements that support hair growth (biotin, etc) I used the Lipogaine twice per day for about 9 months steady, I now use it once per day. Within the first month I could visually see new hair growing all over the top of my head. By 3 months the old hair on the top of my head had shed out, replaced by thicker new hair - it was even curly! My hair dresser was so impressed. I would recommend this product as it worked for me. I plan to continue using it on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> Tbh if anything I think I lost a spot I only used it once on a spot that has been a bit bald that I don&#x27;t remember before using the product but I don&#x27;t wanna blame the product but I wouldn&#x27;t waste the money. If you really care about hair growth soak your hair in oils and keep it in over night. (Canola, coconut, vegetable, olive oil etc) it makes your hair a million times healthier and shinier in just a few uses.  Look it up online.</li>
    <li> I have researched a lot of products concerning hair growth and every company said their work but this one is actually showing a difference. I wanted something I didn&#x27;t have to apply for the rest of my life and this one offers one that opportunity to quit whenever. Once in the morning before you start your day and then before you go to bed. It is not oily bit seems to absorb into the scalp quickly. I would recommended it to anyone that has thinning hair.</li>
    <li> My dad used Rogaine for over 5 months. We didn&#x27;t see any growth whatsoever. It might have a little bit less hair loss. This product smells and dries similarly as Rogaine, so he didn&#x27;t have much hope in the beginning. Fortunately, he did see amazing regrowth after he used this product for 4 months. It is like miracle. We still can&#x27;t believe it. He strongly recommend anyone give it a try for a few months. It should work at least the same if not better than Rogaine because of the additional ingredients in this product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Stopped losing hair to the brush and shower and am now growing new&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;sprouts&amp;#34; all over!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Rogaine for years and decided to try this product.  Lipogaine seems to be a little more effective than Rogaine.  It may be because of the extra ingredients in this product.  But I&#x27;ve noticed new hair growth in areas that I had been using Rogaine.  The growth appears to be new, so I can only assume Lipogaine is more effective.</li>
    <li> When Lipogaine send me a sample of their product for review it could not have come at a better time. I have been experiencing hair fall out and could not figure out why it was happening. After using Lipogaine and Hair Covet (a supplement)  for a month now, I have noticed less hair falling out. My hair overall looks much fuller, so much so that my husband even noticed and commented about it. I am planning to order more once the product is finished because in my case it has worked.</li>
    <li> I went to the dermatologist three years ago for thinning hair and found that I have a genetic condition.  He said the only way to keep longer fuller hair would be to use a minoxidil product going forward.  I started with the major brand but found Lipogaine two years ago and saw that it has additional vitamins and biotin.  The changes are always slow with hair, but my hairdresser has definitely noticed my hair being less thin and being able to grow longer than it has in a long time.  I plan to keep using Lipogaine!</li>
    <li> made my head itch and had gotten a thick crust on my head</li>
    <li> I have been using this faithfully, but nothing. I do not think it works. i will give it a little more time.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any changes in the few weeks that I used it</li>
    <li> I have been using Lipogaine for Women for seven months now. Female baldness runs in my family and I was desperate to find something that would at least slow down my hair loss. I have noticed that my hair is thicker and there is indeed some new growth. My hair loss seems to have stopped.  Have not had any of the listed side affects.  Was a little worried about a possible increase in blood pressure but have had no issues there.  Will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me at all</li>
    <li> Guess they might work for some, in growing new hair but not for me. While this doesn&#x27;t seem to grow new hair, it does seem to stop a lot of hair falling out, so it does have some good points. All in all, I&#x27;d say a good product because it works in some aspects for me.</li>
    <li> Great. I loved it. It was very effective for me and had made a drastic difference in my life hair growth.</li>
    <li> My hairline was almost non-existent for years.  I also read the reviews and watched a YouTube video and made the decision to purchase Lipogaine thereafter. I am so glad I did. Lipogaine, along with biotin supplements and a multivitamin, has brought back my hairline.  I am an African American woman and my hair loss is due to weaves and pulling hair back into ponytails constantly.  I can&#x27;t tell you how happy and relieved I am that I no longer have to figure out how to hide my hairline. I am also rotating every other month with Minoxidil due to another reviewer&#x27;s suggestion. Lipogaine is more expensive but it is worth it at least for me.  If you are desperate like I was, you may want to give it try.  I hope it works for you like it has for me :-).</li>
    <li> I noticed my hair was thinning when my natural part began to reveal more scalp than usual. I panicked and started searching for a remedy. I tried shampoos aimed at rectifying the issue but to no avail. Minoxidil works fabulously for me. Be sure you research the side effects for yourself before making the decision to use this product, as it IS a drug.</li>
    <li> No results as yet ...I have only been using it one week. Feel free to check back with me at another time.</li>
    <li> It has only been a month and a half.I am on my second bottle because I saw some results from the first bottle,so I&#x27;m hopeful I will continue to see more growth.</li>
    <li> maybe its just me or it is this product. ive used it for 1 week in conjunction with lipogaine 3 shampoo and garlic mask, i see lots of baby hair on top especially after ironing the hair straight. its not so thick still wispy looking but its good news for me. but my hair still falls out. it hasnt really stop it completely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these hair growth supplements for two months and so far my hair has became very thick and boost my hair growth. My has grew four inches so far. And I cannot wait to see next month growth.</li>
    <li> This has helped me regrow my hair in the thin spots that I have had for years.  I have used various minoxidil products that were more expensive with little results.  When I started using Lipogaine along with trichogen and purador shampoo, I immediately saw of results of thicker hair and regrowth that I haven&#x27;t had in over fifteen years. My hair has filled in along frontal hairline and the top of my head.  My hair was getting so thin that I could see my scalp, now I don&#x27;t see my scalp using Lipogaine.  This has definitely regrown my hair versus other minoxidil products that just sustained the hair I had.  This works better for me than plain minoxidil and remox.  I love it and am very thankful for the Lipogaine company for making such a wonderful product.  It has renewed my self- confidence and given me hope.  I sure wish I knew about it years ago.  I got an itchy scalp with other minoxidil products, but never with Lipogaine.  I will keep buying, so keep making it.  It is nice to be seeing my hair get thicker instead of thinner.  I love this product!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Alcohol(even on skin) gives me headaches.  So, after first use, got a headache.  Never was able to see if worked on hair growth.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife who has thinning hair  on the crown of her head... after  reading the  side effect, she  would not use  it&lt;br /&gt;perhaps these effect should have been on the website????</li>
    <li> I lost about 2/3 of my hair over the last few years due to menopause.  I started using this product and have been very impressed.  It took about 4 months to see results though so be prepared.  I got lazy and became sporadic about using it and my hair started thinning again so stay on the product to keep the results.</li>
    <li> My hair had been thinning gradually for some years to a point that I couldn&#x27;t ignore it anymore. I stumbled into this product and was skeptical after reading what other people&#x27;s raving reviews. I finally made my decision after extensive online research for each of the ingredients in this product. This seemed that only product that has both minoxidil and DHT blockers in one formula for female hair loss treatment.  I am very happy with my decision.  After continuous use of this product for 3 months, my hair is apparently much thicker than before. I will continue to use it and hope my hair will be as full and shine as 5 years ago. Hooray!</li>
    <li> made my hair fall out</li>
    <li> I did not really know what to expect when I got Lipogaine in the mail. All I know is that I wanted to get it so that my grandmother can try it out. She has used harsh chemicals to color and treat her hair in the past - and now she has significant hair loss and a bald patch on the top of her head that I know bothers her a lot. She tried this product and was pleasantly surprised with the results. She now has tiny baby hair growing on the areas that lost some hair in the past. I must say that we are both happy with the results and would recommend this product to others!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> FPB kinda runs on my moms side of the family. My moms sister has had to wear a wig since her late 20s, and my mom has thin fine hair and uses nioxin products with limited results. I am 23 and started noticing my hair thinning when i was 20. It really freaked me out because i really do have beautiful hair, natural waves and curls and ringlets that i would hate to lose. Just the anxiety caused by the thought of becoming bald gave me nightmares and a constant worry that the bald patch on the back of my head was showing itself off to the world. Ive been using lipogaine for just over 2 months now and i do notice a difference. It does NOT have a bad smell and it only changed the texture of the hair for the first week or so and then my scalp got used to the product and absorbs it well without residue. The bald and thinning patch on the back of my head is now just a line (or a part) with thin hair. I know that in time the hair will grow in thicker and soon there wont be any patch or line left to see. I have more confidence and a peace of mind knowing that my thinning hair issues are resolved. This product is definetily worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for three weeks now.  It is not the worst product I have ever brought but I have used this for sometime and I can say several things on it.  One:  the smell is great.&lt;br /&gt;  Two:  the liquid is oily and if you place it on your finger tips, you will&lt;br /&gt;  notice that it sticks to it...as it dries.&lt;br /&gt;  Third: After one day of use...the next day your scalp will become&lt;br /&gt;  unbearably itchy...to the point that you think you have another aliment.&lt;br /&gt;  The itch is unbearable.  I cant do this.  I am going to have to stick with&lt;br /&gt;  vitamins, and not worry about it.  The itch is to annoying.  I put it on&lt;br /&gt;  after I shampoo, and the next day it itches like crazy.  I will try to&lt;br /&gt;  keep using it because I dont want to waist it, and I do believe it is&lt;br /&gt;  working, but the ITCH...OMG.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t regrow the thinning hair</li>
    <li> I have bought this product for my girlfriend and I can say that I am impressed. She had dreads for 3 years for her hair loss problem. Her confidence was low. After 2 months of using the Lipogaine for women her hair was completely stopped after 4 month her lost hair is at least 70% regenerated. She is very thankful for this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works and works VERY well!! I had been struggling along for over 3 months using womens Rogaine twice per day. Then I ordered this Lipogaine and, within 1 month (the 1st bottle!!) I started to get hair growing again on top and sides. I HIGHLY recommend giving this a try.</li>
    <li> Thanks Amazon for carrying such good product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using the product for woman and my brother for men and we are both very happy with Lipogaine. I&#x27;m after 2 Pregnancies and I&#x27;ve noticed a lost of hair right after the first pregnant, lipogaine stopped the lost of hair after the second bottle.</li>
    <li> I use Lipogaine for women.  My hair had seriously thinned on top of my head.  I started using Lipogaine on an area about 2.5 inches by 2.5 inches on top of my head where the hair loss was most severe.  During the first month of usage I started to see new hair growth.  After several months of usage new hair is still covering that balding area and to my amazement the hair that grew back is black whereas my normal hair is white.  I dye my hair dark brown and the one complaint I have is that in the area that I treat with Lipogaine the hair dye does not penetrate the hair as well.  My hair stylist uses a special product that makes the white hair more absorbent of the dye.  So the problem is almost resolved.  I do have a streak of lighter dark brown hair where I use the Lipogaine but it looks O.K.

    <li> I would not be without this product. It took a few months but since using Lipogaine I have noticed a definite improvement in the thinning of my hair associated with age. I stopped using it at one point and after a couple of months noticed my hair looking thinner. My sister uses it also.</li>
    <li> This product caused blood in the urine and had to be discontinued.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine for years and, in combination with other vitamins and minerals, it seems to be keeping the thinning at bay.  I have androgenic alopecia, as did my mother, and she had only about ten hairs left by the time she was my age.  I can only assume that my regimen -- of which Lipogaine is the foundation -- is what&#x27;s kept my thinning to a minimum.  Just a note for other women suffering from androgenic alopecia -- the sooner you start using these products, the better.  I learned that the hard way --- I should have jumped on the bandwagon ten years earlier than I did.</li>
    <li> This product really works. My hair started thinning due to menopause. I have been using the product for 30 days and the results are amazing. I just received my second bottle, I am looking forward to even better results. I am also taking a daily Biotin supplement. I have been taking Viviscal supplements and using the hair lotion since Janaury which produced good results in terms of hair thickness and faster growing nails but did not fill in the bald spots. Lipogaine made me smile again!!! My edges are filling in and no more bald spots.</li>
    <li> I was looking to replace a minoxidial product that had been recalled by the FDA when I came across a consumer recommendation for Lipogaine. Desperate, I decided to order a bottle on Amazon. Now, I&#x27;m hooked!!! Not only did I see new growth after only one month but, Lipogaine leaves no sticky residue unlike most other minoxidil solutions. Please do not hesitate. Lipogaine works. You&#x27;ll be thrilled with the results, I know that I am.</li>
    <li> After going thru chemotherapy and radiation several times for cancer, I got tired of wearing scarves or hats, especially when it&#x27;s hot. After my first bottle of Lipogaine for Women, I noticed little bangs growing back and my receding hairline is filling in! I wasn&#x27;t sure how this would work but really had nothing to lose. After about 3 months, baby hair started coming in, so I continued to use it. These results include the fact that I would forget to use it some nights and usually didn&#x27;t use it in the daytime. Now that it is working so well, I will be more diligent about using it as directed.</li>
    <li> WHen I saw the product I was skeptical on trying it since I tried everything and did not have any success....Well let me just tell you after reading a few reviews I decided to give it a shot.....After three weeks of consistent use I actually starting seeing strands of hair growing back where I had lost it.....I am so grateful to have found this product on amazon that I shared it with my sister who is also experiencing hair loss and both of us are very happy campers lol....My hair grew in to the point where I am able to get it braided....Just to give you a little history on why I lost my hair  I have lupus in my scalp and it had started to take my hair out tremendously and I was very depressed because you know how us sisters are when it comes to our hair but thank GOD for lace wigs lol....Now that my hair has grown back in I can get some relief from these wigs I will tell anyone who is experiencing hair loss give this product a try you will not regret it....A very very satisfied customer</li>
    <li> After using this for only a week my hair being to fall out. Found a lot of hair in my wide tooth comb. very disappointed and a little scary. Product did not smell or itch. If it works for you wonderful, but not for me. Everyone&#x27;s chemistry is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess what?[[ASIN:B0037T0YES Lipogaine for Women: Minoxidil Enhanced with Biotin and Vitamin for Thinning Hair Loss / Hair Regrowth Treatment Professionally Formulated Extra Strength Version, 60 ml/2oz]] The company replied and informed me of minoxidil shredding. I looked it up and found it to be true and will be continuing and will get back to you soon. Look it up. If its true, its will be a wonderful thing!!!</li>
    <li> This product is dangerous, and I believe a doctor should only dispense it.&lt;br /&gt;LipoGaine should have warning in bright red, when the product is shown on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if minoxidil works, but I won&#x27;t find out from this product. When I apply it, it makes my roots greasy. That&#x27;s the last thing I need with fine thinning hair. In the trash it goes. Keranique&#x27;s product does not make the hair greasy.</li>
    <li> I personally used this product 7+ months and see good results.  You have to be consistent and use it twice per day.  It takes some time to see results, I saw results within 8 weeks but I will not give up before 3-4 months of consistent use. It has some smell but does not last after applying. I highly recommend it.  Also keep in mind the results will reverse if you stop using it.</li>
