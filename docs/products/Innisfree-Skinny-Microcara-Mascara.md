      <li>This is my favorite mascara because the wand doesn&#x27;t cause me to get mascara on my eyelids</li>
      <li>and omg I love it.</li>
      <li>I love the skinny brush.</li>
      <li>This product is awesome for getting every single lash on the top and bottom lids.</li>
      <li>It does a great job at separating lashes and giving a good &amp;#34;doe-eyed look.&amp;#34;  It clumps slightly after time (over a month), but it&#x27;s still usable, I just comb it a bit.  </li>

      <li>Clump free, smudge free &amp; stays all day.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also great at getting to the smaller lashes close to the inside corners of my eyes.  </li>
      <li>I never thought I would love a micro mascara wand so much!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ONLY good for undereye lashes.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s only good for undereye lashes or touch up.</li>
      <li>I tried a mascara that was kind of similar</li>
      <li>Fast delivery!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
      <li>Wow really love this product really lengthen my lashes and keeps them looking natural</li>
      <li>It gives you nice dark lashes that you can build up without making it spidery.</li>
      <li>How much money and time did I spend for the mascara like this...</li>
      <li>it lengthens your lashes very well.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe that this skinny brush really works..</li>
      <li>i would not recommend this to someone that wants a very volumizing mascara, because it&#x27;s deffinitly not that.</li>
      <li>this is the best for your under eyelash for sure!&lt;br /&gt;Because of a bit more expensive price than it should be in Korea (since it&#x27;s imported), I&#x27;d want to buy again but will try to look for other similar item in the states.</li>
      <li>It also is able to give your lashes a slight curl if you don&#x27;t feel like curling your lashes that day and</li>
      <li>Thought there few products out there for under eyelash in the U.S.,&lt;br /&gt;wanted to try this item since it&#x27;s chosen for one of the top mascara for under eyelash.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>very natural and doesn&#x27;t have clumps.</li>
      <li>it is very natural.</li>
      <li>the package also arrived a day early so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
      <li>This mascara is for those that want natural length that will hold without the thickness.</li>
      <li>Came a week early.</li>
      <li>I bought the black shade and it is definitely true to color.</li>
      <li>It really gives natural long eyelash possible.</li>
      <li>I have pretty thick lashes for an Asian, but my lashes are like very straight.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This mascara is amazing. I love the skinny brush. I tried a mascara that was kind of similar (bourjois no clumps something like that.....) but this one is better. There was no flaking or smudging and my lashes were lengthened. The formula easily washes off with water. I would definitely buy this mascara again.</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical. I  didn&#x27;t think the tiny  brush would work well but it is suprisingly good. Clump free, smudge free &amp; stays all day. It was  very quick and easy to apply and it doesn&#x27;t move it&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
    <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used... it lengthens your lashes very well. Unfortauntely, the expiration on my mascara passed... but it&#x27;s still great?? so I will continue to use it since it gives me great results.</li>
    <li> Wow really love this product really lengthen my lashes and keeps them looking natural the package also arrived a day early so that&#x27;s a plus. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a lengthening mascara, so if you&#x27;re looking for volume I suggest either using this alongside another product or to skip it altogether. I would definitely recommend this product if you want to achieve long, spidery lashes. Application is a bit difficult especially if you&#x27;ve only used big brushes to apply mascara.</li>
    <li> I bought it on a whim and omg I love it. I have semi-long lashes and this just make them even longer. I&#x27;ve been using it for months now and I haven&#x27;t used another mascara since.</li>
    <li> Makes my lash like fly leg.</li>
    <li> I was intrigued by the skinny brush.. I&#x27;ve tried them all.  I can&#x27;t believe that this skinny brush really works.. it pains me to think of all these wasted thick brushes..  this mascara coats great.  It also curls nicely.. I still curl my eyelashes usually before and after I put the mascara on.  It does a great job at separating lashes and giving a good &amp;#34;doe-eyed look.&amp;#34;  It clumps slightly after time (over a month), but it&#x27;s still usable, I just comb it a bit.  I got this instead of Blinc since Blinc only lasted a few weeks before it became unusable due to clumping.. I&#x27;m very happy with this alternative.  It&#x27;s also great at getting to the smaller lashes close to the inside corners of my eyes.  Not sure I&#x27;ll use it all the time due to the cost, but I love it.</li>
    <li> Holy crap this is amazing! My eyelashes lifted with out a curler! I have pretty thick lashes for an Asian, but my lashes are like very straight. This products it great for lengthening and natural-ish looking lashes. Not a lot of people like this look for some reason but I love it! I also got freaked out of the date on the item as I thought it was 3 months expired. DO NOT WORRY :) It is the manufacturer date. I looked it up since it had Korean symbols on it. It translates to it too. J-Beauty were very nice sellers too! Came a week early.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! But more than that! Bestever mascara I &#x27;ve experienced. No clumping, no smudging, easy to apply, easy to remove. It really gives natural long eyelash possible. Why I did not know it until now? How much money and time did I spend for the mascara like this... But I am really happy! Good job, Innisfree! :D</li>
    <li> I usually use It Cosmetic skinny mascara and thought to give this a try since it is less expansive. My asian lashes just doesn&#x27;t curl up very well if the formulation is too heavy and clumpy. This is mascara is awesome. It stays on my lashes and will not give me a panda look after 8hrs like most mascara. It&#x27;s light weight but allows lifting. Easy to wash off when I use the oil wash and doesn&#x27;t cause the lashes to fall off during wash. The price is a good. So I will purchase more. The seller is great also very fast shipping and included samples. Very happy and will order more. Just hope they don&#x27;t run out of this mascara from the seller!</li>
    <li> I never thought I would love a micro mascara wand so much! This product is awesome for getting every single lash on the top and bottom lids. It also has a great formula to really hold a curl and withstand sweat without smudging or flaking. It is budge proof, but somehow very easy to remove with makeup remover! It also is able to give your lashes a slight curl if you don&#x27;t feel like curling your lashes that day and the volume and length are buildable with multiple coats. Love love love this mascara!</li>
    <li> I like to apply this mascara on my lower lashes. This product doesn&#x27;t give you the volume affect.</li>
    <li> This is my secret weapon for no-makeup-makeup. The formula is buildable but I only wisp two strokes at the ends of my lashes after curling and that is enough to give me extensions. I personally hate that heavy mascara look. This mascara is for those that want natural length that will hold without the thickness. The opaque black is enough volume for my already black lashes. The skinny wand is the BEST!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star off because innisfree is not cruelty-free. But hey I&#x27;m using it and loving what this product does for my eyelashes and can&#x27;t find any cruelty-free mascaras that does what this product does for my lashes.</li>
    <li> very natural and doesn&#x27;t have clumps.</li>
    <li> The brush is too skinny to volumize the eyelashes.  It&#x27;s only good for undereye lashes or touch up.</li>
    <li> I wish I could find mascaras with this tiny of a wand here in the states but I can&#x27;t. This is my favorite mascara because the wand doesn&#x27;t cause me to get mascara on my eyelids and I can coat every lash perfectly. I don&#x27;t do my bottom lashes but if you do this would be a perfect brush for that as well. I bought the black shade and it is definitely true to color. My lashes look so long with this mascara and I not had the problem with it flaking. Definitely will repurchase.</li>
    <li> I accidentally bent this mascara, my fault.....but overall I like the amount of mascara was applied to my eyelashes, light and defined.</li>
    <li> Thought there few products out there for under eyelash in the U.S.,&lt;br /&gt;wanted to try this item since it&#x27;s chosen for one of the top mascara for under eyelash.&lt;br /&gt;And this is the best for your under eyelash for sure!&lt;br /&gt;Because of a bit more expensive price than it should be in Korea (since it&#x27;s imported), I&#x27;d want to buy again but will try to look for other similar item in the states. But would definitely buy it if I visit Korea or if there&#x27;s a way to get it cheaper.</li>
    <li> the brush/wand is extremely flimsy. It&#x27;s ONLY good for undereye lashes.  I thought this would be like Browlash EX lash sculpture but was nothing like it.  I will continue using for undereye lashes but will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mother since she has very small lashes. The brush is the perfect size and she gets great coverage, which complements her eyes. When she washes off her makeup, it isn&#x27;t difficult to remove. I would definitely purchase this again for her when she runs out.</li>
    <li> very good i love this!! it is very natural. i would not recommend this to someone that wants a very volumizing mascara, because it&#x27;s deffinitly not that.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing skinny mascara. The applicator only takes out enough product, so the brush is not saturated with product. It gives you nice dark lashes that you can build up without making it spidery.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my truly skinny eyelashes. I will definitely repurchase and recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> even the shipping took around one month, the product is perfect</li>
