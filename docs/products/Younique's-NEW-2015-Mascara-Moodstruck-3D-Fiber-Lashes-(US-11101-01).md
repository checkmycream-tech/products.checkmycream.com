      <li>This product is just awesome.</li>
      <li>Works great with Sephora&#x27;s &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; mascara.  </li>
      <li>The product works, but it&#x27;s not as good as it appears  in the photographs I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
      <li>Love this mascara at a great discount price.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I PURCHASED FROM AN AUTHORIZED YOUNIQUE REPRESENTATIVE, and I love the product!  </li>
      <li>Amazing buy.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery and amazing product!!</li>
      <li>I have to agree with many of the reviews on this item.</li>
      <li>and there&#x27;s pieces on my face, embarrassing My drug store brand works better, save your money and go to Walgreens ...</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Love</li>
      <li>had so many complements</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Love this 3 D mascara.</li>
      <li>so glad Ibought it anyways.  </li>
      <li>Love, love, love this product.  </li>
      <li>AMAZING &amp; super easy to use!</li>
      <li>This product says it is manufactured for Younique products Pleasant Grove, UT when the real stuff shows Lehi, UT.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also waterproof, but easy to remove.</li>
      <li>This is my first time applying it,so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get better over time.</li>
      <li>I have always dreamed of having beautiful long lashes.</li>
      <li>Thanks!!!</li>
      <li>You will definitely not be disappointed.  </li>
      <li>But it still is worth it at the end!  </li>
      <li>Just special days</li>
      <li>It extends my lashes without clumping, if you do it right!</li>
      <li>I got a full refund Thank God.</li>
      <li>it worked best, if I started high way down my lashes and stroked up...</li>
      <li>It actually makes me feel more confident.  </li>
      <li>Fast Delivery I recommend the seller!!</li>
      <li>Definitely worth it to have longer, fuller looking lashes.</li>
      <li>It takes practice and can get clumpy fast if you try multiple layers, but i am sure with some practice it will get better.</li>
      <li>Best bet is to buy false eyelashes.</li>
      <li>something wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
      <li>With that being said I do think it works pretty good, but I am going to get a new set from an actual younique rep and see if there is a difference.</li>
      <li>It comes with the transplanting gel which you apply first &amp; then apply the fibers &amp; then the gel once again.</li>
      <li>I have pretty wimpy eyelashes, andafter hearing about this product</li>
      <li>Maybe it needed better step by step instructions because the length of my lashes looked the same.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a knock off that delivers nowhere near the results of the genuine product.</li>
      <li>while it looks good when you first apply it after only a short time it starts flaking and really bothers my eyes</li>
      <li>I have long lashes, but I wanted even longer more defined ones.  </li>
      <li>But it does seem to work, just not sure if it is a good quality as the real stuff yet.</li>
      <li>although I do like how fast it arrived, doenst make much of a difference with my lashes because thicken them with clumps.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>this is not the real thing.</li>
      <li>Much easier to apply than I anticipated.</li>
      <li>and i haven&#x27;t had any real issues.</li>
      <li>The product shipped fast and arrived on time.</li>
      <li>I  love it ,,its better than trying to apply false lashes</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this brand.</li>
      <li>I have used this product about 5 times so far and will compare to the real thing eventually.</li>
      <li>It!!..Makes my lashes super long!!..</li>
      <li>I have bought this 3 times already but have only used the first one so far.  </li>
      <li>Only trouble I have is with my teenage girls trying to use it all up because they like it better than their mascaras!</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t see how Younique will stay in business for long.</li>
      <li>What I found to work for big bold long lashes was Urban Decay&#x27;s Perversion mascara combined with their Subversion Lash primer.</li>
      <li>Ive tried several times to make this work for me before giving up completely!</li>
      <li>My lashes have never looked longer or more voluminous…and they are short and thin.  </li>
      <li>The instruction sheet that is included also has a little typo that is what really shouted</li>
      <li>so I did a little research and found out that this is not the real thing.</li>

<li> I will never go back to plain mascara or even false eyelashes.  </li>

<li> This product is NOT AUTHENTIC Younique 3D Fiber</li>
<li> No more lash extensions.</li>
<li> the fibers can get in your eye and be a little annoying but that doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
<li> I always felt that when I wore false eyelashes people would notice and they always felt heavy.</li>
<li> Makes your eyes lashes look thick.</li>
<li> I was a little skeptical about the amount, but</li>
<li> The only bad thing I have to say about it</li>
<li> may just be me personally, but I had  horrible allergic reaction to it causing nearly my whole face to redden, swell, and burn terribly.</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t doubt they use fake eyelashes.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed to say the least.</li>
<li> do not do as the instructions say and start at the base of the lashes...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Ive tried several times to make this work for me before giving up completely! I was very disappointed to say the least. I even tried different YouTube tutorials to try to make it work to no avail. Always a clumpy mess.even with a eyelash brush. My eyelashes looked NOTHING like the pics they present. I wouldn&#x27;t doubt they use fake eyelashes. Best bet is to buy false eyelashes. the fibers fall all over your face as well. I got a full refund Thank God. What I found to work for big bold long lashes was Urban Decay&#x27;s Perversion mascara combined with their Subversion Lash primer. I really don&#x27;t see how Younique will stay in business for long. Save your money and buy something that works!!!</li>
    <li> This product is NOT AUTHENTIC Younique 3D Fiber Lash Mascara.&lt;br /&gt;It is a knock off that delivers nowhere near the results of the genuine product.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara at a great discount price. Shipping was prompt. I will order again.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it!  She said she will buy from again!  Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> AMAZING &amp; super easy to use!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this product before, but actually found it lesser expensive on here, than ordering it from the vendor or person that sales it. It extends my lashes without clumping, if you do it right! It comes with the transplanting gel which you apply first &amp; then apply the fibers &amp; then the gel once again. That locks the fibers in place. I love it! It didn&#x27;t take long to receive either. It&#x27;s also waterproof, but easy to remove.</li>
    <li> Love It!!..Makes my lashes super long!!..Only trouble I have is with my teenage girls trying to use it all up because they like it better than their mascaras!</li>
    <li> Love this 3 D mascara. Makes your eyes lashes look thick. Fast Delivery I recommend the seller!!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t make my lashes look longer or thicker, too much of a hassle to apply and half the fibers ended up in my eyes!</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!! My girlfriend loves it!!!</li>
    <li> I have bought this 3 times already but have only used the first one so far.  What I can tell you is that try using a coat or two of your regular mascara before doing the gel and then the fibers and gel again.</li>
    <li> although I do like how fast it arrived, doenst make much of a difference with my lashes because thicken them with clumps.&lt;br /&gt;This may just be me personally, but I had  horrible allergic reaction to it causing nearly my whole face to redden, swell, and burn terribly.</li>
    <li> I did notice a difference in the way my lashes looked after using the product but I didn&#x27;t like the outcome and quality of the product.  Maybe it needed better step by step instructions because the length of my lashes looked the same.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. This stuff works. I was a bit skeptical but thought what the hey and was shocked and glad that I took a leap of faith. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift from my husband, and I noticed that there was a typo in the instructions so I did a little research and found out that this is not the real thing. With that being said I do think it works pretty good, but I am going to get a new set from an actual younique rep and see if there is a difference. Do your research and ask questions before purchasing. This product says it is manufactured for Younique products Pleasant Grove, UT when the real stuff shows Lehi, UT. The instruction sheet that is included also has a little typo that is what really shouted something wasn&#x27;t right. But like i said it seems to work like it is supposed to and i haven&#x27;t had any real issues. It takes practice and can get clumpy fast if you try multiple layers, but i am sure with some practice it will get better. I have used this product about 5 times so far and will compare to the real thing eventually. The product shipped fast and arrived on time. Shipping and packaging were perfect. My only complaint is that by what i have been informed by info online and a younique rep this is not the real thing. But it does seem to work, just not sure if it is a good quality as the real stuff yet.</li>
    <li> Love it. Don&#x27;t have to use it all the time. Just special days</li>
    <li> Amazing buy. Works great with Sephora&#x27;s &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; mascara.  I get dozens of compliments and questions about my eyelashes.  People think I am wearing falsies.  You will definitely not be disappointed.  The only bad thing I have to say about it it&#x27;s the price could be a bit lower.  But it still is worth it at the end!  :)</li>
    <li> the fibers can get in your eye and be a little annoying but that doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> The fibers were messy &amp; got in my eyes</li>
    <li> I have pretty wimpy eyelashes, andafter hearing about this product, I decidedto give it a try.  I was a little skeptical about the amount, but so glad Ibought it anyways.  Definitely worth it to have longer, fuller looking lashes.</li>
    <li> Much easier to apply than I anticipated.</li>
    <li> while it looks good when you first apply it after only a short time it starts flaking and really bothers my eyes and there&#x27;s pieces on my face, embarrassing My drug store brand works better, save your money and go to Walgreens ...</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and amazing product!!</li>
    <li> I have to agree with many of the reviews on this item. I have tried this several times and it makes my eyelashes extremely clumpy and the fibers are constantly falling in your eyes and on your face.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product.  The only downfall is I wish it didn&#x27;t have to be replaced once a month.</li>
    <li> Best purchase Ive made this year!</li>
    <li> I have long lashes, but I wanted even longer more defined ones.  The product works, but it&#x27;s not as good as it appears  in the photographs I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED FROM AN AUTHORIZED YOUNIQUE REPRESENTATIVE, and I love the product!  I will never go back to plain mascara or even false eyelashes.  After watching a number of videos on HOW TO apply Younique 3D Moonstruck Fiber Lashes and some practice, I have it down now.  My lashes have never looked longer or more voluminous…and they are short and thin.  It actually makes me feel more confident.  I highly recommend this brand.</li>
    <li> This is awesome stuff, will be ordering more&lt;br /&gt;Have had so many complements</li>
    <li> This product is just awesome. No more lash extensions.</li>
    <li> I have always dreamed of having beautiful long lashes. I always felt that when I wore false eyelashes people would notice and they always felt heavy. I started using a prescription formula to help grow my lashes with no success. I just received this today and whipped it out and I can&#x27;t believe the results. This is my first time applying it,so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get better over time. My eyes do not feel heavy and they are not irritated. Thank God for whomever thought of this genius idea.</li>
    <li> The product can cause irritation if the fibers fall in your eyes... it worked best, if I started high way down my lashes and stroked up... do not do as the instructions say and start at the base of the lashes...</li>
    <li> I  love it ,,its better than trying to apply false lashes</li>
    <li> Great product! Don&#x27;t bother ordering the cheaper versions. I tried them and they don&#x27;t work.</li>
