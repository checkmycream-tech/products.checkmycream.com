<li> It&#x27;s a slow process</li>
<li> not knowing EXACTLY what is in these bottles is scary and dangerous!!</li>
<li> The worst part is that people rely on essential oils for their healing properties and some are used on children as well....</li>

    <li> I bought this oil when Young Living was out of Cedarwood.  I knew that I was risking getting an opened or inauthentic product, but I use Cedarwood daily for sleep and for thinning hair.  The Cedarwood came in a timely fashion and was just as described.  It smelled the same as the Cedarwood I bought from YL, and the seal was intact.  I am very happy with my purchase and would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I love the woodsy smell. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month for alopecia. It&#x27;s a slow process but I&#x27;m still hopeful. The product arrived on time without any issues and the price is affordable.</li>
    <li> Love this essential oil.  It can be used in so many applications.  I use it in my shampoo and conditioner and as a hair treatment at night.  The smell is amazing and is very calming to the body and mind.</li>
    <li> Over priced. Not right to sell here . Was as stated. Sealed.</li>
    <li> I really, really like the smell of this! I know other reviewers mentioned not liking the smell. To me, it reminds me of sitting in front of a bonfire on the beach. And maybe that is why I love it. If you have ever been in a hot sauna made of cedar this is the smell. Its relaxing and calming, Smells manly and woodsy.I definitely think it gives the effects of relaxation.</li>
    <li> It does help me sleep better</li>
    <li> I use YL oils cedarwood and vetiver at night before going to bed for my adult adhd.  I think it helps.</li>
    <li> This is NOT sealed with an OFFICIAL YOUNG LIVING cap/seal!!!! I just ordered Cedarwood through YL and I can assure you that this is NOT the seal used and patented by the company, which means that this bottle was opened and resealed.  Why? I think you can figure that out on your own.  Just like the common scam on the streets of nyc to sell diluted name-brand perfumes and market them as discounted designer perfumes that &amp;#34;fell off the back of a truck&amp;#34;, these oils are not what they appear to be.  The worst part is that people rely on essential oils for their healing properties and some are used on children as well....not knowing EXACTLY what is in these bottles is scary and dangerous!! Would you accept food or medication that had been opened and resealed?  Everyone is familiar with the Warning Label on products &amp;#34;Do Not use if seal has been tampered with&amp;#34;...Well, THIS SEAL HAS BEEN TAMPERED WITH PEOPLE and I have no doubt that these oils being resold here on Amazon are either diluted or adulterated with Who Knows What! Don&#x27;t waste your money and stop taking such a risk buying what could be an amazing product if you just knew for sure it was pure, which is exactly what Young Living Guarantees and 3rd party tests on each and every batch to prove.  Spend the few extra bucks and rest assured you are getting what you intended to purchase.  You get what you pay for and then some.</li>
    <li> Nothing better than YL Cedarwood for sleep</li>
    <li> beautiful aroma, we love the outdoors smell and this is not too strong of a scent. it&#x27;s perfect for aromatherapy.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t smell like any cedar I&#x27;ve ever smelled before</li>
    <li> Love being able to get essential oils from Amazon.  Nice price and love the free shipping.</li>
    <li> Cedarwood mixed with lavender helps to put my kids to sleep. It&#x27;s wonderful! I can not say enough good things about young living oils!</li>
    <li> Great it works great for what I need.</li>
    <li> This oil has a strange scent to me, but it helps me to sleep soundly once I put some on the soles of my feet I am off to La La land!</li>
    <li> Item exactly as promised and on time!</li>
    <li> Great product. I wear these frequently</li>
    <li> New to using the essential oils but have heard there are many uses for the Cedarwood! Can&#x27;t wait to use with other oils!</li>
    <li> Cedarwood is fantastic, my mom was having a hard time sleeping and she noticed a change immediately.</li>
