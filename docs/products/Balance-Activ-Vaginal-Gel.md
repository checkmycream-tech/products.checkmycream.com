      <li>I continued using out the box thinking it would it better..</li>
      <li>but I was better before I used it.  </li>
      <li>I understand this works for most woman</li>

      <li>I feel so Good about my self and feel Free of BV right now.</li>
      <li>So easy to use.</li>
      <li>company that has shipped each time (Direct Kart) is AMAZING!</li>
      <li>make sure to take the full week</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also been able to use this to prevent a full on BV case once I start to notice symptoms occurring.  </li>
      <li>shipping was quick too!</li>
      <li>If you have BV, order Balance Activ from Direct Kart and you will feel better in no time! :)</li>
      <li>You can feel a HUGE difference after just one dose.</li>
      <li>I wish that I had something detailed to say about this product, but the truth is that it did not work for me into doing what it was intended to do...</li>
      <li>Works great for any regular odor control, itch, sex discomfort, after period issues, discharges, etc.</li>
      <li>easy to use, very pleasant, causes a little tingling sensation but that passes.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend trying this!!!!</li>
      <li>worked along with lacto capsules (PurFem, Nature&#x27;s Way Primadophilus Original, Jarrow&#x27;s Femdophilus).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ordering it again 6 months after my original purchase.</li>
      <li>Also, the applicator is much more user friendly and you can utilize all of the product with a gentle squeeze.</li>
      <li>I took this treatment for the full 7 nights as directed.</li>
      <li>Buy cheap fresh garlic.</li>
      <li>and i feel a tremendous difference.</li>
      <li>This stuff knocks out BV Quick and thoroughly.</li>
      <li>and I am still feeling like my normal self wish more people knew about this product</li>
      <li>Balance Activ cleared my BV symptoms quickly and now I just use it for maintenance right before and after my menstrual cycle.</li>
      <li>It takes quite a while to get them, but it&#x27;s definitely worth the wait.</li>
      <li>..not worth it</li>
      <li>Honestly, I&#x27;ve been looking for a long time for something like this.</li>
      <li>I tried others and the only thing that ended up solving my problem was good old fashioned GARLIC.</li>
      <li>First time in my life.</li>
      <li>After that I had to resort to flagy, which I was avoiding in the first place.</li>
      <li>Worked the first day then after that didn&#x27;t work...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many similar products.  </li>
      <li>It really works!</li>
      <li>This is effective and does not cause other side effects.  </li>
      <li>i wish it were more of a long term &amp;#34;helper&amp;#34; but like i said, it works for a day and keeps it at bay, but nothing longterm.</li>
      <li>Things naturally calmed on its own, so I decided to try to give it another shot to see if it would help to clear up things completely.</li>
      <li>push it through a press, (about 3 cloves to half a pint of warm water), then insert with a large medicine dropper or douche 2 to 3 times a day until infection is gone.</li>
      <li>And after the first 2-3 days of using the first box, right after my period as recommended, I started to develop major irritation.</li>
      <li>This stuff really really works.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update: I used the whole package of 7 and its been 3 months</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m feeling very hopefuly at this point</li>
      <li>This product didn&#x27;t really work for me.  </li>
      <li>It has worked very well for me, and I plan to continue ordering it.  </li>
      <li>Every woman should have a stash at the ready to nip any pH issue in the bud.</li>
      <li>Works much better for me that any other product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this highly.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I experienced discharge with a faint smell.</li>
      <li>I was very excited to try this product after suffering with BV consistently over the last few months.</li>
      <li>Each tube can theoretically last several applications with no negative effects if you clean applicator with alcohol wipe and store in ziploc bag.</li>
      <li>All the others were very disappointing at best.  </li>
      <li>could not live without it right now.</li>
      <li>i have bought several boxes to keep on hand for after being intimate with my husband.  </li>
      <li>Ive used it now for 3 days after having yet another bout of BV, and the smell is completely gone.</li>
      <li>Luckily nothing was missing.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nothing major, though.</li>
      <li>It came highly recommended by a friend who suffered the same problem and says it is the only thing that works for her.</li>
      <li>Used to rebalance the natural flora in my body following antibiotics.  </li>
      <li>Instantly relieves discomfort, odor, itchiness and restores natural moisture.</li>
      <li>and I am back to normal although it does come back after my period.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I experienced the same horrible effects than the first time x 2.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product!  Wish they sold it in the U.S.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m totally sold on this product.  I&#x27;ve tried many similar products.  All the others were very disappointing at best.  I am particularly happy with the ingredients--lactic acid, for example--and with a pH of 3.8.  It has worked very well for me, and I plan to continue ordering it.  The only negative was the box had been crushed and torn open.  The Post Office had attempted to tape it together.  Luckily nothing was missing.  It takes quite a while to get them, but it&#x27;s definitely worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Great product on its own.&lt;br /&gt;Also worked along with lacto capsules (PurFem, Nature&#x27;s Way Primadophilus Original, Jarrow&#x27;s Femdophilus). Poured some Balance Activ in applicator (applicator from local compounding pharma or from OTC yeast medicine in the tube, not the suppository). Then opened the lacto capsules and poured the powder into the applicator, then topped off with remaining Balance Activ. 7 days at bedtime. Worked great!</li>
    <li> This is wonderful stuff, you will never have to take antibiotics for BV again, it works wonders!  Also good for use after intimacy</li>
    <li> 5 star product works better than the others use two days out of the month and I am back to normal although it does come back after my period.&lt;br /&gt;Update: I used the whole package of 7 and its been 3 months and I am still feeling like my normal self wish more people knew about this product, it really is a the best thing out there and has a fantastic price too! make sure to take the full week and you wont have any reoccurances</li>
    <li> cheaper than the american brands and works just as well as rephresh gel. shipping was quick too! I&#x27;ll buy this item again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had issues with cervical erosion since giving birth. my dr. recommended I use rephesh ph gel and womens probiotics. turns out its harder to find the rephresh gel in stores than I expected and it costs way too much. i opted to try this and it work and works well. The applicator is even easier and more efficient to use than rephresh. I used it every 3 days for about 2 weeks, now I just use it weekly or monthly to maintain my recovery. No longer having pain during sex and no funky smells. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Noticed symptoms would return by noon after using gel the night before, and after about 4 days gave up altogether because I couldn&#x27;t stand the symptoms.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t really work for me.  For years I&#x27;ve been trying to find something to get rid of my BV because the antibiotics don&#x27;t work.  This actually made it worse.  I&#x27;m not sure if it gave me a yeast infection or something but I was better before I used it.  I understand this works for most woman but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> i have been fighting for years against yeast infection and BV. I am using this product and it works!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I use 3 tubes per week.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!!  I have been suffering from chronic BV for almost a year and this is the best prevention I have found.  Best to use it at night because otherwise, it &#x27;leaks&#x27; and isn&#x27;t as effective.  I&#x27;ve also been able to use this to prevent a full on BV case once I start to notice symptoms occurring.  I&#x27;m buying more so that I have plenty of it on hand.  America, please sell this product in your drugstores!!!!</li>
    <li> Ive been using two tubes (one a day) after my period, and when i had to take antibiotics i used four in a row after (one a day) and i always take two rephresh pro-b a day, ive been able to keep a healthy ph this way, i love the ingredients on this product, no scents and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great product!! could not live without it right now. Many times BV is caused by an infection in the gut + leaky gut syndrome. It has been a symptom for me of biotoxin illness with a chronic immune inflammatory response. Until I can go through treatment this has been the best  (plus I do probiotic suppositories) over traditional and alternative treatments. Highly recommend. If this a constant issue for anyone check food allergies, mold exposure issues etc with a Naturopathic Doctor (no I am not one :P) also check out Dr. Ritchie Shoemaker for biotoxin illness genetic predisposition information.</li>
    <li> Its day 5 of the 7-day course and although the discharge is less, it still has not cleared up completed as promised.  My hopes are dwindling...again!</li>
    <li> they are a little hard to get out of the tube</li>
    <li> Balances vaginal pH and you get much more product at a lower price than the way overpriced comparable product from US stores repHresh. Also, the applicator is much more user friendly and you can utilize all of the product with a gentle squeeze. Each tube can theoretically last several applications with no negative effects if you clean applicator with alcohol wipe and store in ziploc bag. Works great for any regular odor control, itch, sex discomfort, after period issues, discharges, etc. not caused by disease, just regular feminine issues. Every woman should have a stash at the ready to nip any pH issue in the bud.</li>
    <li> I had a baby and after the bleeding stopped I had a terrible bacterial infection. First time in my life. this was rated highly so I was desperate to try anything. Did not work for me. Offered some relief but got worse immediately after I quite using it. I tried others and the only thing that ended up solving my problem was good old fashioned GARLIC. As well as adding raw probiotic supplements and B vitamins. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Buy cheap fresh garlic. push it through a press, (about 3 cloves to half a pint of warm water), then insert with a large medicine dropper or douche 2 to 3 times a day until infection is gone.</li>
    <li> Worked the first day then after that didn&#x27;t work... Very disappointing</li>
    <li> This product worked for me. I experienced discharge with a faint smell. Found this product and used it for 7 days. Symptoms gone. Using it every week or so will help keep ur ph balanced.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I&#x27;ve been looking for a long time for something like this. Figures it would be an English product not an American one. This stuff knocks out BV Quick and thoroughly.</li>
    <li> Restores pH as promised&lt;br /&gt;With only 3 applications&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again</li>
    <li> Works much better for me that any other product I&#x27;ve tried.  Similar products have added chemicals that cause problems for me.  This is effective and does not cause other side effects.  I&#x27;m ordering it again 6 months after my original purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST product for BV (Bacterial Vaginosis). You can feel a HUGE difference after just one dose. So easy to use. There are 7 pre-filled tubes. I wear a maxi pad when I use this as there is a little leakage. It&#x27;s nothing major, though. I first used this product while living in the UK and can not explain how wonderful it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company that has shipped each time (Direct Kart) is AMAZING! Each time I&#x27;ve ordered they ship the very next day. They are in Birmingham, England and I&#x27;m in the US. I receive my product only 7-8 days later! BV is an issue that needs to be addressed ASAP and they obviously understand. If you have BV, order Balance Activ from Direct Kart and you will feel better in no time! :)</li>
    <li> This works wonders. I had BV and after I did the 7-day treatment, it was all clear down below. I recommend this highly. This is the best product out!!</li>
    <li> This product is really helpful for women who suffers BV. Prescribed anti-biotics may kill the bacteria but this helps to maintain the PH that is caused under control that is caused by overgrowth of bad bacteria. I think with time if you keep continuing using this product it will help to prevent BV.</li>
    <li> IT SUCKED!! I&#x27;ve been battling BV since forever! This does NOT work all it does is create a big mess! You basically need to wear a pad just to use it! Please don&#x27;t even try it!</li>
    <li> easy to use, very pleasant, causes a little tingling sensation but that passes. helps keeping yeast infections and bv away. i would give it 5 stars if the delivery was any faster. it didn&#x27;t take longer than the estimate, but still it took over 5 weeks.</li>
    <li> Has a tendency to sting, which made steer away. Wasn&#x27;t practical because it is too liquidy which made it run all over the place, so I felt I wasn&#x27;t getting the application and dose to stay put for any length of time!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work! I wish that I had something detailed to say about this product, but the truth is that it did not work for me into doing what it was intended to do...Fail...plus it comes from overseas and takes a while to ship..not worth it</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good product. Didn&#x27;t cure me , but helped a lot. BV is hard a bacteria to get&lt;br /&gt;rid of I&#x27;m told and this was by far the best product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Instantly relieves discomfort, odor, itchiness and restores natural moisture. Started using it for a few days and i feel a tremendous difference. Love it!!</li>
    <li> This does work...but only for a day.  i have bought several boxes to keep on hand for after being intimate with my husband.  i wish it were more of a long term &amp;#34;helper&amp;#34; but like i said, it works for a day and keeps it at bay, but nothing longterm.</li>
    <li> This stuff really really works. I tried just about everything and nothing worked. Balance Activ cleared my BV symptoms quickly and now I just use it for maintenance right before and after my menstrual cycle.</li>
    <li> though i don&#x27;t need it anymore, still is a good product.</li>
    <li> After suffering from BV for years; I was desperate to find something that would help with my BV. Ive had 6 episodes of it this year. This problem has caused me to shy away from an active sex life with my husband. I happen to come across balance activ while doing research online on products that help to prevent or cure BV, and skeptically ordered it.. Ive used it now for 3 days after having yet another bout of BV, and the smell is completely gone. I feel so Good about my self and feel Free of BV right now. I&#x27;m feeling very hopefuly at this point and I&#x27;m PRAYING that this is the soloution to ending this terrible, smelly problem that I&#x27;ve had for years.</li>
    <li> After years of trying every Eastern and Western product to no avail, this actually worked for me. I highly recommend trying this!!!!</li>
    <li> be carefull whith this product I had bad feeling inside when I used burning sensation dosent work for me no...</li>
    <li> I took this treatment for the full 7 nights as directed. I still have discharge and I don&#x27;t think it helped my BV at all! The box was delivered to me extremely smashed up, but I was so desperate to get better that I used the treatments as soon as I could. I&#x27;m glad it worked for others, but it didn&#x27;t do a thing for me.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this product after suffering with BV consistently over the last few months. It came highly recommended by a friend who suffered the same problem and says it is the only thing that works for her. I bought two boxes since it ships all the way from the UK... And after the first 2-3 days of using the first box, right after my period as recommended, I started to develop major irritation. I continued using out the box thinking it would it better.. Only for thing to get worse. I was left which a much worse infection that before plus irritation, itching, swelling and redness. I think it my have made my BV worse and may have also promoted a slight yeast as well. Things naturally calmed on its own, so I decided to try to give it another shot to see if it would help to clear up things completely. Big mistake... I experienced the same horrible effects than the first time x 2. After that I had to resort to flagy, which I was avoiding in the first place. But thankfully that cleared things up for. This product may work for some... But for me, just made things worse. I would not be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> Used to rebalance the natural flora in my body following antibiotics.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from BV for years and this is the only product that works for me. It really works!</li>
