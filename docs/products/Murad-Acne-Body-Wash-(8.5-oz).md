      <li>I can tell its a good body wash but hasn&#x27;t don&#x27;t much for me.</li>
      <li>Nice scrubbing sensation and cooling fresh feel.  </li>
      <li>I really enjoy this cleanser.</li>
      <li>So far I haven&#x27;t seen good results.</li>
      <li>This is so worth the money!</li>
      <li>I hear some people have had good luck with this, but it certainly didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the most effective when it&#x27;s the last thing you use before getting out of the shower.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m using to much</li>
      <li>Love this product and so much cheaper on here than in the store.</li>
      <li>but it is going quick.</li>
      <li>This was an adequate product.  </li>
      <li>Now I am back to Sebamed, it si much more better that Murad, I think and cheaper.</li>
      <li>It smells great but not worth the cost.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price</li>
      <li>Just after one wash my face felt fresh, clean, and didn&#x27;t hurt as much as it did.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been completely clear with this product for almost 8 months now and would strongly recommend it to anyone with cystic acne.</li>
      <li>Personally I&#x27;ve had much more luck with the pHisoDerm products.</li>
      <li>This worked wonders on my back, follow with the Murad Clarifying Body Spray for even better results.</li>
      <li>My back is all cleared up and looks A LOT better since using this wash.</li>
      <li>THANKS MURAD!</li>
      <li>Absolutely!</li>
      <li>Simply did not work (and we&#x27;re talking mild acne)!</li>
      <li>I have struggled with back acne since high school, and this is the only product that has successfully given me clear skin.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see much of a difference though</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t do much for my skin.</li>
      <li>and now I am almost completely clear!!!</li>
      <li>Other products work MUCH better.</li>
      <li>I actually like the smell and the cool tingling feeling, which makes me think it&#x27;s working.</li>
      <li>Based on what was promised, my expectations were clearly set too high.</li>
      <li>I have recommended this product to my friends and they would say the exact same thing.</li>
      <li>I saw a noticeable decrease in breakouts on my back within the first week of using this body wash.</li>
      <li>The other ingredients in Murad Acne Body Wash allow me to use it daily without causing any damage to my skin that would spur more acne.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other salicylic acid based products in the past that have had at best only short term effects.</li>
      <li>a little strong for your face</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, lasts a long time and Amazon offers the most competitive price.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone wanting to clear up their body blemishes.</li>
      <li>This body wash makes you feel clean and has a slight cooling tingle to it.</li>
      <li>Worked very well for a couple days after that acne started coming back.</li>
      <li>Cleared back acne fast.</li>
      <li>but I did not see much change on the blemishes that were already present.</li>
      <li>Using both really cleared up my back.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is the shape of the bottle/ tube, it&#x27;s really easy to use too much.</li>
      <li>Only complaint is the smell - kind of chemically - but it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
      <li>My skin is tough and if anything this made me break out more.</li>
      <li>Definite think twice before buying if you have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>not worth the high price tag.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve been a long time sufferer of cystic acne on my back.</li>
<li> Has helped my red rough upper arms and forearms.  </li>
<li> Did not completely clear up my skin by any means.</li>
<li> It works just the same as other acne body washes.</li>
<li> and I needed to battle the potential for acne due to sweat and dirt from the gym.</li>
<li> Does not make your skin dry.  </li>
<li> It is not harsh on your skin like a lot of other cleansers, cleans well, and lasts at least for a couple of months if you use it daily.</li>
<li> After almost a year if no oil-free lotion was applied, my skin became a little dry after using the facial cleanser twice a day and the body cleanser once a day.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t dry it out super crazy as well.</li>
<li> I have horrible skin and have used many different products and murad finally helped.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have extreme acne</li>
<li> I have oily skin and am not sure how it will react to dry skin.</li>
<li> I just get the little bumps from sweat</li>
<li> Did a little bit in controlling it</li>
<li> Sounds like this works for most, but I have very sensitive skin and for me, this made my acne worse and has given me a terrible rash.</li>
<li> Literally the only thing that makes my body acne go away completely in a few days!!!</li>
<li> I use this everyday</li>
<li> Long term use of these products always seemed to make the problem worse.</li>
<li> Only slightest complaint is not even a real complaint.</li>
<li> After a couple of months, I had hardly any acne.</li>
<li> At least the redness is neutralized.  </li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time sufferer of cystic acne on my back. I&#x27;ve tried other salicylic acid based products in the past that have had at best only short term effects. Long term use of these products always seemed to make the problem worse. The other ingredients in Murad Acne Body Wash allow me to use it daily without causing any damage to my skin that would spur more acne. I&#x27;ve been completely clear with this product for almost 8 months now and would strongly recommend it to anyone with cystic acne.</li>
    <li> a little strong for your face but it works for back acne.  i would recommend it. ordering it online says you anywhere for 10 - 20 dollars.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with back acne since high school, and this is the only product that has successfully given me clear skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body wash for about a year now, with [[ASIN:B000GDDKJY Murad Acne Clarifying Body Spray, Step 2 Treat/Repair, 4.3 fl oz (125 ml)]]. Using both really cleared up my back. I&#x27;ve gone a couple days without using the spray, like when I&#x27;ve gone on vacation, and haven&#x27;t had any break outs, but I try to use the body wash daily. I would definitely recommend getting both and using them together! Definitely worth the price</li>
    <li> This product mademe super happy. My chest and back cleared up immediately after several uses. I have recommended this product to my friends and they would say the exact same thing. We have all been pleased with our results!  THANKS MURAD!</li>
    <li> Great for all over.  Does not make your skin dry.  Nice scrubbing sensation and cooling fresh feel.  I use this in the summer when I&#x27;m sweating more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always suffered from back and chest acne, and I once I started usuing this every morning in the shower (just on those spots) it cleared up and now I have very few breakouts!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t do much for my skin. I used it for 3 months and it&#x27;s only helped control the acne on my back. I don&#x27;t see much of a difference though so I&#x27;ll be using my neutrogena again since it&#x27;s cheaper &amp; worked the same.</li>
    <li> This was an adequate product.  I may purchase again however I got similar results from the Alba AcneDote bodywash and it is cheaper.  I also purchased the Murad anti wrinkle/anti acne starter kit (instore) and have been very pleased with that product.</li>
    <li> This is the only solution to the stubborn body acne I aquired later in life. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, lasts a long time and Amazon offers the most competitive price.</li>
    <li> A bit pricey but seems to work!</li>
    <li> BEST body wash I&#x27;ve EVER used, and it ACTUALLY WORKS. I&#x27;m in the gym all the time (6 days a week) so as you can imagine I sweat a lot and had acne/bumps on my back because of it. My back is all cleared up and looks A LOT better since using this wash.</li>
    <li> I saw a noticeable decrease in breakouts on my back within the first week of using this body wash. It&#x27;s the most effective when it&#x27;s the last thing you use before getting out of the shower. I actually like the smell and the cool tingling feeling, which makes me think it&#x27;s working. My only complaint is the shape of the bottle/ tube, it&#x27;s really easy to use too much.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have never seen better results from acne body wash. I ran out of the product and switched to another brand for just three days and my acne was horrible.  Until I no longer face acne I will never stop using Murad ever again.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT PRICE, GREAT SERVICE</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the reviews but didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I used it for about 1 month maybe more but I had acnes constantly.  Now I am back to Sebamed, it si much more better that Murad, I think and cheaper.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have been suffering from acne for YEARS! I used this for only about a week and now I am almost completely clear!!! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who suffers from body acne. I was skeptical to try it considering I have tried almost everything else. From holistic to diy everything and this by far is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used!!!</li>
    <li> If you have any sort of acne on your body this is the perfect product. I go to the gym a lot and I needed to battle the potential for acne due to sweat and dirt from the gym. I use this everyday and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;This product showed up on time, no issues. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love this product and so much cheaper on here than in the store.</li>
    <li> Product came to my house very fast, I was very pleased with that but the product itself did not work at all for my daughters&#x27; acne on her back and chest.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a month and I still haven&#x27;t seen an improvement.  It does feel like it&#x27;s working with a tingling tea tree oil sensation,  but it hasn&#x27;t produced any noticeable results.  I would save your money and try something else.</li>
    <li> Based on what was promised, my expectations were clearly set too high. Will not purchase again. Other products work MUCH better. Very, very disappointed in Murad. Simply did not work (and we&#x27;re talking mild acne)!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this works any better than the Neutrogena stuff you can buy at the drugstore. It smells great but not worth the cost.</li>
    <li> This stuff is incredible! Literally the only thing that makes my body acne go away completely in a few days!!!</li>
    <li> Bought it for body acne break-outs. Did a little bit in controlling it but I did not see much change on the blemishes that were already present. Probably works best as part of a regimen.</li>
    <li> Worked very well for a couple days after that acne started coming back.</li>
    <li> I bought this body wash for my back acne. So far I haven&#x27;t seen good results. It works just the same as other acne body washes. I don&#x27;t have extreme acne I just get the little bumps from sweat and it doesn&#x27;t even take those away. I can tell its a good body wash but hasn&#x27;t don&#x27;t much for me. May works wonders for others so this product is definitely a hit or miss.</li>
    <li> It definitely seems to be working. It is a perfect combination on abrasive and cleansing. And it smells nice. I will buy again. Only slightest complaint is not even a real complaint. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m using to much but it is going quick.</li>
    <li> Great item really works. Cleared back acne fast.</li>
    <li> Like the Amazon pricing and the product works great.  Keeps acne at bay on any part of your body.  Use with a loofah for best results.</li>
    <li> didnt help at all im afraid.. give me a rash and made the acne even worst after few days. i must be allergic to some of the ingredients</li>
    <li> Sounds like this works for most, but I have very sensitive skin and for me, this made my acne worse and has given me a terrible rash. I have stopped using it and I&#x27;m sending it back. Definite think twice before buying if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Did not completely clear up my skin by any means. not worth the high price tag. I hear some people have had good luck with this, but it certainly didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this cleanser. A couple years ago I was prone to acne all over body -- any area you can imagine! After using a multitude of products, my mom had found this cleanser along with Murad&#x27;s &amp;#34;Time Release Acne Cleanser&amp;#34; for my face. Just after one wash my face felt fresh, clean, and didn&#x27;t hurt as much as it did. Then after a couple of days you could tell a noticeable difference between my face and body than before. After a couple of months, I had hardly any acne. I love this and would recommend this to anyone with severe acne, has oily skin, or is prone to acne. I have oily skin and am not sure how it will react to dry skin. After almost a year if no oil-free lotion was applied, my skin became a little dry after using the facial cleanser twice a day and the body cleanser once a day. Now I only use both cleansers once a day because my acne is not severe anymore. This is so worth the money! It is not harsh on your skin like a lot of other cleansers, cleans well, and lasts at least for a couple of months if you use it daily.</li>
    <li> I havent been using it everday but i feel that since I started using it, it has made my back-acne worse &#x3D;( Will try to use daily to see if there are any improvements</li>
    <li> Good product but Neutragena is just as good and cheaper. Save your money!</li>
    <li> Did it work, yeah I guess. Could&#x27;ve worked better? Absolutely! Personally I&#x27;ve had much more luck with the pHisoDerm products. Friend of mine swore up-and-down how good the Murad products are, and that&#x27;s just it, they may work great for him but not for me</li>
    <li> Good Seller, the product os ok!</li>
    <li> I use Murad Skin Care for my face as well. I like this body wash because I can actually use it on my face in the shower instead of using my skin care wash. This body wash makes you feel clean and has a slight cooling tingle to it.</li>
    <li> I love all of murads products. I have horrible skin and have used many different products and murad finally helped. Didn&#x27;t dry it out super crazy as well. Love love love.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Works great and even smells good!</li>
    <li> This worked wonders on my back, follow with the Murad Clarifying Body Spray for even better results. My back cleared up in under two weeks. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to clear up their body blemishes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month now and have seen a change in my skin. I will definitely continue to use. Only complaint is the smell - kind of chemically - but it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> Did not work out for me. My skin is tough and if anything this made me break out more. On to the next item to see if I can find something that works.</li>
    <li> Use as the last thing before rinsing off.  Has helped my red rough upper arms and forearms.  At least the redness is neutralized.  Also gave to 2 of my daughters who have inherited this unsightly problem.</li>
