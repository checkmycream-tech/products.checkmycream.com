      <li>Love the roll-on feature.</li>
      <li>I found that the permanent solution would be to remove&lt;br /&gt;refined food and most of all sugar from my diet.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>, Aveeno soap and lotion, steroid creams, no scented products ever!, drink more water, etc.</li>
      <li>I could go on and on about how it has healed, sealed that part of my face, but more than that...</li>
      <li>All I know is I&#x27;m glad it now comes in \\&quot;purse\\&quot; size...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products (derm recommended creams, i.e. euceryin, aveeno,Mario badesco, etc.)</li>
      <li>MADE SKIN FLAKIER AND REDDER.&lt;br /&gt;ON TOP OF IT</li>
      <li>I will be buying more of this product.</li>

      <li>To tell you the truth, I just reached for it, because I had nothing else available.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many different products for my Eczema on my face and this by far has been the best product I have used.  </li>

      <li>Thanks Homestead :)</li>
      <li>Now that our daughter is 4.5 years old, she can apply the oil on her own with the easy-to-hold bottle.  </li>
      <li>usually never write reviews on here, but I felt I need to, because it&#x27;s such a pure and great product!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing, and I can wear short sleeves now!</li>
      <li>I recommend to put this on at night if you wear make-up to ensure it all gets absorbed into your skin.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s a natural product, not a medication.</li>
      <li>I love using the all natural product over prescription steroids.</li>
      <li>This product is 100% worth it.</li>
      <li>For the better part of 2.5 years, we&#x27;ve been using this natural product when the scaly and itchy skin pops up (often at night).  </li>
      <li>You see it heal the skin right in front of your eyes.</li>
      <li>I like the applicator on this a lot - very easy to simply roll on and I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting anything medicated on my hands.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also used this on my own eczema spots for 2 years now, and will happliy continue to use this product on my dry spots.</li>
      <li>We use it a few times a day right after a bath do a good rolling and then seal it with a good heavy cream.</li>
      <li>After about a week of constant use, the spots looked much better.</li>
      <li>Made baby&#x27;s skin even more red and inflamed.  </li>
      <li>For years, we tried many different products to help my son&#x27;s eczema, but nothing worked.  </li>
      <li>This is consistently effective while other just stop working.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>The roll on applicator makes it easy for them to use independently.  </li>
      <li>Very convenient.  </li>
      <li>I really like the fact that it comes in a roll on tube so that it is easier to apply.</li>
      <li>size is very convenient to store in my purse and for traveling.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always used steriodal creams without much relief and always worried about their side effects.  </li>
      <li>Very convenient.</li>
      <li>This product penetrates the layers of skin to bring real relief to my elbow area.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very grateful</li>
      <li>It hurt my fingers too much to roll it on my fingers</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve been a fan of it since she was 4 months old when her skin issues first surfaced.  </li>
      <li>both drugstores and department stores) moisturizers, to prescribed highly moisturized creams.</li>
      <li>I had a high expectation, but it did no work for me.</li>
      <li>But it didn&#x27;t really help my eczema as far as I could tell.</li>
      <li>This eczema oil really helps to keep my skin soft and minimizes the dryness/flaking.  </li>
      <li>I ordered a new bottle, but in the 3 days between him running out of oil and receiving the new bottle, his eczema broke out again with a vengeance.  </li>
      <li>After years of trying drug-store products and home remedies, this completely cleared up my son&#x27;s eczema!</li>
      <li>, I might as well try it.&amp;#34; I have been using this for five days and my fingers have almost completely healed!  </li>
      <li>Other ointments or moisturizers only made him itch more</li>
      <li>To be honest, I may not have been able to give it a truly fair shot because within a few weeks of receiving the bottle the oil had become rancid and the smell was too horrible to even consider applying it to myself.</li>
      <li>One day I walked into a natural health foods store and decided to give this a try.</li>
      <li>and he (not liking natural wonders)</li>
      <li>This product stand out from nearly all products on the market for eczema.</li>
      <li>He must be sensitive to one of the oils</li>
      <li>My eczema really flared up this winter, and even creams made for eczema were irritating my skin more.  </li>
      <li>One weekend of liberal application later, my arms look 100% normal!</li>
      <li>My son has continued to use it after every shower and every swim, and the eczema has never returned--until recently, when he ran out of the oil after getting to the bottom of the bottle before he told me he needed a new one!  </li>
      <li>I first discovered this miracle oil when I saw an advert in Military Spouse magazine and couldn&#x27;t wait to try the Eczema Oil.  </li>
      <li>Since this is an internal health issue, and since he is very stubborn about not going about a proper diet, I decided to purchase this to treat the symptom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Definitely a keeper in my arsenal of natural products in battling my eczema flare-ups!  </li>
      <li>And yet all I&#x27;ve ended up with is damaged patches of skin on my arms that the steroids have thinned out so much that they constantly get torn open and bleed, even now that the eczema is long gone from that spot (of course this is in addition to the normal unbeatable ezcema).</li>
      <li>My 6 year old has suffered from severe eczema for the last 4 years.  </li>
      <li>Finally I leaned about this all natural eczema oil, and it has been a lifesaver.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried multiple creams, ointments, natural &amp; prescribe.  </li>
      <li>My daughters get rough patches near their mouths in the winter, &amp; the eczema oil completely cures it.  </li>
      <li>After 3 days of using this natural oil, my itchy dry patches were gone!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product did not work on my eczema. Made my skin flakier and redder. I use betonite clay and my eczema cleared up.</li>
    <li> i have not seen any improvement on my sons eczema when i use this product on the affected areas. however, he came home one day from daycare with a nasty diaper rash, cried when sitting in tub, and i put this stuff on at bedtime and voila the diaper rash was gone by the next evening.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from eczema my entire life. Doctors have suggested so many things: Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser instead of soap, no loofa ever!, Aveeno soap and lotion, steroid creams, no scented products ever!, drink more water, etc. And yet all I&#x27;ve ended up with is damaged patches of skin on my arms that the steroids have thinned out so much that they constantly get torn open and bleed, even now that the eczema is long gone from that spot (of course this is in addition to the normal unbeatable ezcema). One day I walked into a natural health foods store and decided to give this a try. One weekend of liberal application later, my arms look 100% normal! No itching, no flaking, no redness, no bleeding. It&#x27;s amazing, and I can wear short sleeves now! The oil itself is sort of creamy - thicker than you&#x27;d expect an oil to be. It doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant odor, and it doesn&#x27;t stain. I just carried it around for a few days, and every few hours, I rubbed some oil into the area, and the itching never bothered me again. This product is 100% worth it.</li>
    <li> The eczema on my elbows itched so badly I nearly went insane.  Finally I leaned about this all natural eczema oil, and it has been a lifesaver.  No longer do I wake up scratching myself raw.  This product penetrates the layers of skin to bring real relief to my elbow area.  I&#x27;m very grateful I found it, and once you try it I&#x27;m sure you will be too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from \\&quot;cracked\\&quot; skin on the sides of my nose, where the end of your nose meets your cheek, for years.  The skin not only peels, it leaves a raw, red, sometimes bleedy area from how dry that part has been. I&#x27;ve tried the best, from over the counter (both drugstores and department stores) moisturizers, to prescribed highly moisturized creams. Of course, I would get temporarily relief.  Then, one day, I decided to try this product, which I already had, as I use it on my daughter&#x27;s eczema \\&quot;cheecks\\&quot;. To tell you the truth, I just reached for it, because I had nothing else available. I could go on and on about how it has healed, sealed that part of my face, but more than that... I wish I could attach before/after pictures!  All I know is I&#x27;m glad it now comes in \\&quot;purse\\&quot; size... I have it in my makeup bag.</li>
    <li> it made her her eczema worst the dark spots got even darker, she was using it twice a day, she was soooo disappointed. I read the reviews and thought I had found the answer but it was a major disappointment, so back to trying to find something that will work!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been battling facial eczema for the past 1 1/2 yrs.  I&#x27;ve tried multiple creams, ointments, natural &amp; prescribe.  This eczema oil really helps to keep my skin soft and minimizes the dryness/flaking.  Love the roll-on feature. (a little goes a long way!  Also the 1 oz. size is very convenient to store in my purse and for traveling.  Definitely a keeper in my arsenal of natural products in battling my eczema flare-ups!  😊</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff out there for eczema! The only thing that has cleared up my daughter&#x27;s eczema! I would not buy anything else. We all use it. It lasts a long time, since you roll it on. Very convenient. Awesome customer service!&lt;br /&gt;I usually never write reviews on here, but I felt I need to, because it&#x27;s such a pure and great product! Their Diaper Companion is awesome as well!</li>
    <li> Love love love the roll on applicator!  Very convenient.  The oil is great too.  My son suffers from eczema and this product has really helped his dry spots.  I love using the all natural product over prescription steroids. Great company from which to order too!</li>
    <li> This is literally the only thing that has helped our daughter&#x27;s eczema.  We&#x27;ve been a fan of it since she was 4 months old when her skin issues first surfaced.  Love this company and product!!</li>
    <li> My 6 year old has suffered from severe eczema for the last 4 years.  We have never used a steroid cream as I don&#x27;t think that is a solution.  While ultimately eczema is ALWAYS caused by diet or environmental factors, The Homestead Company&#x27;s eczema is the ONLY soothing rememdy I have found on the market, and I have tried a ridiculous amount.  IT is gentle, non irritating, and doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of garbage added.</li>
    <li> This Eczema Oil is amazing!  For years, we tried many different products to help my son&#x27;s eczema, but nothing worked.  Then, a couple of years ago, we found this company online and tried their Eczema Oil.  It was like a miracle!  It cleared up the eczema almost immediately!  My son has continued to use it after every shower and every swim, and the eczema has never returned--until recently, when he ran out of the oil after getting to the bottom of the bottle before he told me he needed a new one!  I ordered a new bottle, but in the 3 days between him running out of oil and receiving the new bottle, his eczema broke out again with a vengeance.  I am shocked at the effectiveness of this product, and I guarantee we will not be running out again!</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful!  My daughters get rough patches near their mouths in the winter, &amp; the eczema oil completely cures it.  The roll on applicator makes it easy for them to use independently.  It is a regular part of their bedtime routine now.  It lasts forever, too!</li>
    <li> I really like the fact that it comes in a roll on tube so that it is easier to apply. (I think that my son thinks it is a game, whenever I put it on, he cracks up laughing like it tickles!)&lt;br /&gt;The other thing is the fact that it is NATURAL, so I can take comfort when putting it on his face. (The medicine always worried me, so I was hesitant to use it on his face. )&lt;br /&gt;It has cleared up his outbreaks which makes him happy... and of course, when he is happy, I am happy too!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my father who has psoriasis. He was constantly (still is) scratching his legs. The sores he was creating were horrendous and the skin was flaking off like snow. Since this is an internal health issue, and since he is very stubborn about not going about a proper diet, I decided to purchase this to treat the symptom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s been using this now twice a day for a month and he (not liking natural wonders) actually comments on how he does like it! When I looked at the flare up on his leg before this item was applied, it was scabby and flaky and red. I looked at it again, a month later, the scabbiness is almost gone, the flakiness has stopped, but it is still red. He likes it because it&#x27;s like a light moisturizer for his skin. Other ointments or moisturizers only made him itch more (like that was possible). Another reason why he likes this is the roll-on application.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different products for my Eczema on my face and this by far has been the best product I have used.  I use to have to put cream on my very dry face several times a day and now after using this product I only put face cream a couple times a day.  It keeps my face hydrated, soothes my face, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and best of all its all natural ingredients.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I have never written a review before, but I have to now. I have suffered with eczema for years. My latest outbreak started in Sept. 2014 when I had a severe reaction to fresh ginger root. I am writing this review in May 2015. I tried everything from Crisco shortening to Epsom salts. I was in constant pain from the cracked and split skin on my fingers. I had to bandage my fingers and wear cotton gloves with vinyl gloves just to go about my daily living. I saw this eczema oil and I thought, &amp;#34;What the heck, I might as well try it.&amp;#34; I have been using this for five days and my fingers have almost completely healed!  I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle, but I sure got one! The one thing I would ask the company to change is the roll on bottle. It hurt my fingers too much to roll it on my fingers so I had to roll it on the palms of my hands and work it in that way. This stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> I first discovered this miracle oil when I saw an advert in Military Spouse magazine and couldn&#x27;t wait to try the Eczema Oil.  I&#x27;ve had eczema since I was a teen.  I&#x27;ve always used steriodal creams without much relief and always worried about their side effects.  After 3 days of using this natural oil, my itchy dry patches were gone!  Even my dermatologist was impressed!  Try it.  You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this Eczema Oil on my son&#x27;s eczema spots since he was an infant. I&#x27;ve also used this on my own eczema spots for 2 years now, and will happliy continue to use this product on my dry spots. I love that it&#x27;s a natural product, not a medication. Even eczema medication doesn&#x27;t cure eczema, it just treats the symptoms, and I think this product works just as well.</li>
    <li> Nice texture, quickly absorbs, but it didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my eczema. Still, it was a nice oil for my hands and elbows and cuticles.</li>
    <li> Not pleased.  All oil is the same to me.  They all claim to be &amp;#34;the best and amazing&amp;#34; when no one is better than the other.</li>
    <li> I like the applicator on this a lot - very easy to simply roll on and I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting anything medicated on my hands. But it didn&#x27;t really help my eczema as far as I could tell. To be honest, I may not have been able to give it a truly fair shot because within a few weeks of receiving the bottle the oil had become rancid and the smell was too horrible to even consider applying it to myself.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to make the oil come out on your skin and you have to work hard to get the roller to produce much oil, usually on my hand - not on the spot I was trying to treat. Seems like a great product otherwise.</li>
    <li> THE WORST PART WAS THE BALL THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO DELIVER THE LOTION.  I TOOK IT OFF SO I COULD FINALLY GET SOMETHING OUT OF THE BOTTLE</li>
    <li> TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK. MADE SKIN FLAKIER AND REDDER.&lt;br /&gt;ON TOP OF IT YOU WOULD HAVE A HARD TIME TO RETURN IT. DO NOT RECOMMEND IT.</li>
    <li> The best ingredients in a easy to carry bottle. It relieves dryness without being greasy. I have been using it for about a week. It&#x27;s very hard to find products without chemicals or other mystery ingredients (chemical names which tell me nothing without wikipedia look up). This product stand out from nearly all products on the market for eczema. I found this out after I spent an hour in a store recently reading labels on eczema products and found nothing I would use.</li>
    <li> My eczema really flared up this winter, and even creams made for eczema were irritating my skin more.  This comes in a roller ball so it is easy to apply.  I recommend to put this on at night if you wear make-up to ensure it all gets absorbed into your skin.</li>
    <li> This is consistently effective while other just stop working.&lt;br /&gt;My son has been fighing some of the worst eczema doctors have seen. You see it heal the skin right in front of your eyes. Its not greasy at all and absorbs like a lotion not an oil and the roll on is awesome. This is a must for any eczema sufferer. We use it a few times a day right after a bath do a good rolling and then seal it with a good heavy cream. Ofcourse this is not a eczema cure rather a help in the topical effects. After cortizone, skin gets very thin, sensitive and weak this will give it the elasticity it needs to renew and regrow.&lt;br /&gt;I swear by it.</li>
    <li> I read good review and gave it a shot for my hand eczema. I had a high expectation, but it did no work for me. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Another believer!!! If I could, I would rate this 10 stars. After years of trying drug-store products and home remedies, this completely cleared up my son&#x27;s eczema! He only had two little spots in the back of his knees, but they itched him. After about a week of constant use, the spots looked much better. After a month of use, they are totally gone! And we have used less than 25% of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products (derm recommended creams, i.e. euceryin, aveeno,Mario badesco, etc.) that further irritate my skin. Finally, this eczema oil has gotten rid of a rash under my eyes, that has been there for 5 months! If you have super-sensitive skin, this product is for you!</li>
    <li> The product worked well but I have eczema on my hands so it&#x27;s too greasy to use during the day.</li>
    <li> Made baby&#x27;s skin even more red and inflamed.  Stopped using after a couple of days.  On to the next... :(</li>
    <li> For about 12 months our two-year-old would get eczema-like symptoms under her knees and along her ankles due to a food allergy.  Three different meds from three different doctors did nothing.  Enter Homestead&#x27;s Eczema Oil!  For the better part of 2.5 years, we&#x27;ve been using this natural product when the scaly and itchy skin pops up (often at night).  Does the trick every time.  Now that our daughter is 4.5 years old, she can apply the oil on her own with the easy-to-hold bottle.  We keep it on her night stand!  Thanks Homestead :)</li>
    <li> No results at all,same effect from cheap olive oil. Use almost all of it  - no effect ! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I use it on my scaly eczema skin and it is helping somewhat. I will keep using it. Time will tell.</li>
    <li> This product works well on quieting the scream of eczema. I found that the permanent solution would be to remove&lt;br /&gt;refined food and most of all sugar from my diet.</li>
    <li> I have eczema so bad that my skin cracks opens and peels, I was desperate when I bought the eczema oil. After a couple of uses I was shocked that it worked so quickly. I know there is no cure for eczema but it helped a lot with the cracking and skin dislocation. I will be buying more of this product.</li>
    <li> Good product we just couldn&#x27;t use it on my sons eczema.  He must be sensitive to one of the oils</li>
