      <li>So glad to find this fragrance free conditioner!</li>
      <li>this conditioner (as well as the respective shampoo) is a great product!  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s soothing, creamy, and refreshing.  </li>
      <li>It is one of the better conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used with or without fragrance.</li>
      <li>I was satisfied by the price and the shipping.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a full gallon!</li>
      <li>There is an ingredient in most products  -  even fragrance and so called chemical free products - that cause me to get hives which is a huge pain.</li>
      <li>you need a fragrance free hair gel, try &amp;#34;Free &amp; Clear&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>/&gt;The one gallon container is very economical.</li>
      <li>I love having this in the large bottle with the squirt head.  </li>
      <li>I enjoy my conditioner even more than my DHS free &amp; clear shampoo!  </li>

      <li>styling gel for sensitive skin, no scent and works well! :)</li>
      <li>The 1 gallon size is very affordable and economical.</li>
      <li>It feels nice and thick when massaged into my hair, but rinses off easily.</li>
      <li>BUT BUT it did not do a good job on making her hair soft and did leave her scalp with dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair (dry ends, oily scalp and not too much body)</li>
      <li>It also does a good job of actually conditioning my long hair.</li>
      <li>I am finally happy to find the right conditioner that combats the dry, frizzy and tangled ends without compromising the body or having to feel that it is weighed down or oily.  </li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Makes my shower faster and so much easier.  </li>
      <li>The whole family uses this.</li>
      <li>To maximize conditioning(on an everyday basis), have yourself or your child apply this conditioner in a warm shower, then put on a shower cap for 5 minutes, then rinse.</li>
      <li>and I needed something, not only fragrance free due to allergies but also something to easily comb out after the shower.  </li>
      <li>Gives my thinning hair some much needed body; works better than other natural conditioners I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I was losing quite a bit of hair in a comb or brush after using a product but my hair loss is now at a normal minimum.</li>
      <li>It comes in a big gallon bottle so the price is very reasonable when compared to the others.  </li>
      <li>Truly fragrance free and does not weigh my hair down.</li>
      <li>so I am glad I got the gallon that I fill into the old E.S. small</li>
      <li>It does not affect my allergy at all, it uses natural ingredients.  </li>
      <li>This conditioner is thick and is difficult for me to get out of the regular bottle so the gallon jug with a squirt top works great.  </li>
      <li>I have MASSIVE fragrance allergies: perfume, scented additions to anything, chemical smells like in cleaners and soaps, and Glad Plug-ins to name a few.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m too sensitive to smells mixed with some skin allergies to use normal conditioners.  </li>
      <li>Will definitely buy again, and highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Unlike most Americans, I&#x27;m not about to subject my family (including the dog) to unnecessary poisonous chemicals just to get clean</li>
      <li>As a daily swimmer, they are also gentle enough to deal with that.</li>
      <li>I have tried a few other fragrence free products</li>

    <li> I have searched for the best &amp;#34;fragrance-free&amp;#34; conditioner for a while and have found that this one is the best so far.  Most have left my hair dry where it is still difficult to get our all the tangles.  I have very fine hair (dry ends, oily scalp and not too much body) but it tangles a lot and I needed something, not only fragrance free due to allergies but also something to easily comb out after the shower.  This left my hair feeling softer.  I am finally happy to find the right conditioner that combats the dry, frizzy and tangled ends without compromising the body or having to feel that it is weighed down or oily.  It comes in a big gallon bottle so the price is very reasonable when compared to the others.  And one other extra point -- there is less hair falling out.  I was losing quite a bit of hair in a comb or brush after using a product but my hair loss is now at a normal minimum.</li>
    <li> Love having a fragrance free conditioner that leaves my hair soft and manageable.  Using the gallon size also allows me to share with friends so that I can be around them also.</li>
    <li> Better than Infusiom!</li>
    <li> This is the best deal you could possibly receive! This is the only product on the market and it&#x27;s a full gallon! To maximize conditioning(on an everyday basis), have yourself or your child apply this conditioner in a warm shower, then put on a shower cap for 5 minutes, then rinse. For intense conditioning(once or twice a week), apply conditioner, blow-dry hair, wait 15 minutes, then rinse in cold water. Complaints that this conditioner leaves hair dry are by people who don&#x27;t know how to use this product to its maximum potential.</li>
    <li> So glad to find this fragrance free conditioner! I like the consistency of it -- kind of like pudding -- I dispense some into a little wide mouth plastic jar to keep in the shower. It feels nice and thick when massaged into my hair, but rinses off easily. Gives my thinning hair some much needed body; works better than other natural conditioners I&#x27;ve tried. Will definitely buy again, and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and found it cheaper to buy it by the gallon. I was satisfied by the price and the shipping.</li>
    <li> I love having this in the large bottle with the squirt head.  Makes my shower faster and so much easier.  This conditioner is thick and is difficult for me to get out of the regular bottle so the gallon jug with a squirt top works great.  I&#x27;ll never do it differently.</li>
    <li> I have MASSIVE fragrance allergies: perfume, scented additions to anything, chemical smells like in cleaners and soaps, and Glad Plug-ins to name a few.  It was a quest to find a suitable shampoo (I use DHS fragrance free) and this Earth Science conditioner!  I use this conditioner daily and it&#x27;s been over an entire YEAR and I am still not low on conditioner!  It does not affect my allergy at all, it uses natural ingredients.  It&#x27;s soothing, creamy, and refreshing.  I enjoy my conditioner even more than my DHS free &amp; clear shampoo!  I was going through too many of the conditioner mini bottles so I am glad I got the gallon that I fill into the old E.S. small bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a fragrance free hair gel, try &amp;#34;Free &amp; Clear&amp;#34; styling gel for sensitive skin, no scent and works well! :)</li>
    <li> Fragrance-free is key for us. Unlike most Americans, I&#x27;m not about to subject my family (including the dog) to unnecessary poisonous chemicals just to get clean hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many describe their &#x27;condition&#x27; as an &#x27;allergy&#x27; to chemicals and fragrances. Maybe, but I&#x27;d rather view it as avoiding cancer and chemicals that lower your IQ. I wish the US practiced the &#x27;precautionary principle,&#x27; with regard to chemicals. Instead, we have to wait until people die. Then we take if off the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, conditioner takes a long time to kill you. So do air fresheners. However, why take the risk? This Earth Science conditioner works as good or better as conditioner that stink. Your hair will thank you; so will your friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one gallon container is very economical. Don&#x27;t forget a Gallon Pump Top Earth Science 1 Piece.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used earth science shampoo &amp; conditioner for years due to fragrance allergies. These products work well. As a daily swimmer, they are also gentle enough to deal with that. I rinse my hair with \\&quot;fish tank chlorine neutralizer\\&quot; before shampooing on swim days, but it works just as well on the weekend days without the prerinse. The conditioner also makes a very good shave cream.</li>
    <li> Great getting this conditioner in the gal size. I am allergic to all perfumes/fragrances. Found this conditioner and it works for me. Also good for my hair.</li>
    <li> This product has made my hair feel like straw, I have curly hair and it is now very difficult to comb</li>
    <li> I use this conditioner as a cleansing shampoo (like Wen) and it leaves my hair full of body and bounce without drying or over conditioning it. Truly fragrance free and does not weigh my hair down.I checked it on a website that tests cosmetic product for their toxicity level (Skin Deep - check and compare to other products yourself) It scores the lowest on toxicity of all the other conditioners and shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used. The 1 gallon size is very affordable and economical. There&#x27;s no going back for me to any other product.</li>
    <li> Great product at a resonable price for people who have alergies to Fragrances.  I have tried a few other fragrence free products but this is the one that I have had NO reaction to.</li>
    <li> The whole family uses this. We fill a container for the shower and add a essential oil for a scent here or there!</li>
    <li> There is an ingredient in most products  -  even fragrance and so called chemical free products - that cause me to get hives which is a huge pain. This product does not have it and it&#x27;s thinly one I have found that I can use. I bought a half gallon....</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I would recommend it and at this price, it is a bargain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time as well</li>
    <li> I have been using this conditioner for a year now. I&#x27;m too sensitive to smells mixed with some skin allergies to use normal conditioners.  This product is nearly scent-free (it&#x27;s not scented, at least, and does not bother me.)  It also does a good job of actually conditioning my long hair. I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> this conditioner (as well as the respective shampoo) is a great product!  I started using this because one of my animals had severe allergies to fragrances and this helped her a lot.  Really like how light, clean and fresh my hair feels after using it.</li>
    <li> My wife has used this product (bought two years ago in a gallon size) and it did not cause her to have an allergic reaction, BUT BUT BUT it did not do a good job on making her hair soft and did leave her scalp with dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot but another round of this product even with its new formula.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitivity to fragrances then you will be very happy with Earth Science fragrance-free conditioner. It is an effective conditioner and won&#x27;t inflame your sinuses. It is one of the better conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used with or without fragrance.</li>
