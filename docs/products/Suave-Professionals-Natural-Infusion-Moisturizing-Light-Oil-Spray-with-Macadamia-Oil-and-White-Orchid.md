      <li>It smelled great, made my hair look shiny...</li>
      <li>The price is great too, and the scent of this is just lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Initially I loved this item.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price and the smell is very refreshing.</li>
      <li>has a light pleasant scent which smells really great and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>It will be interesting (to me anyway!)</li>
      <li>I love the scent!</li>
      <li>Her advice gave me the results I wanted and a nice shine.</li>

      <li>I get nice curls, if I don&#x27;t have time for that</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very effective without having to use that much!!!</li>
      <li>Yes, there is a learning-curve, but once you get it right, your hair will look gorgeous!</li>
      <li>I was surprisingly impressed since this is the only oil treatment to make my hair look good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does a good job of smoothing frizzy hair, and adds a nice, light shine.</li>
      <li>It adds a nice sheen and a softness that makes it move better when I swing it around.  </li>
      <li>It adds a bit of shine, not quite as glossy as a glossing spray but just a nice healthy looking shine.</li>
      <li>With all the heat products I use on my hair this is a nice refreshing oil.</li>
      <li>It might be more effective on thicker, coarser hair but</li>
      <li>I am cursed with having very fine hair.  </li>
      <li>The scent of the White Orchid is very nice and gives your hair a great scent as well as some shine and conditioning in between washings and damaged hair</li>
      <li>light oil adds just a touch (I spray lightly) of oil to help control my hair, and adds a very nice scent that accompanies me through out</li>
      <li>Even when I used a very, very light touch, it was still a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Softened my hair nicely and allowed me to run a brush through my hair easily</li>
      <li>/&gt;It reminds me of detangling sprays but in a grown up formulation with a nice light</li>
      <li>It reminds me more of sandalwood than macadamia nuts and orchids.</li>
      <li>I always love using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>notice how your hair stays in an up-do better the day AFTER you shampoo?&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I love this lite spray</li>
      <li>Our family gave this a try and love it.  </li>
      <li>the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure that I would like this - mostly because I thought it would make my hair oily.</li>
      <li>I have always been a fan of Suave and love majority of their hair care products and this oil was no exception.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So now I work with a better conditioner, comb it through in the shower before I rinse, and end up with no tangles.  </li>
      <li>I get much better results.</li>
      <li>Really takes care of my fly aways &amp; frizz, however the smell is too strong for me.</li>
      <li>I have purchased several Suave Professionals products and have really experienced great success with them.  </li>
      <li>I found Suave professionals natural infusion Macadamia Oil to be a great product.  </li>
      <li>light spray is much better and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.</li>
      <li>for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Suave Professionals Natural Infusion line of products are simply amazing and think they&#x27;re better than Pantene!</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a good price for this type of product and because not a lot is needed for a nice smooth look, this 3oz spray bottle will last for a while.</li>
      <li>also like how the mist is a fine spray.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>I had no difficulty using on my fine, wavy hair.</li>
      <li>Strongly recommended for people who are looking for a light hair treatment</li>
      <li>A quick spray gives her some additional shine and softness, and leaves her hair smoother and more managable.  </li>
      <li>This is a light spray that adds oil to your hair.</li>
      <li>fragrance, although quite light, lingered until I washed my hair.</li>
      <li>in between I use a curling iron on my ends to keep my hair smooth.</li>
      <li>If you follow the directions you will be lightly spraying sections of the hair and then comb the macadamia-infused oil through your hair.</li>
      <li>On top of that, it smells great, and doesn&#x27;t feel wet or greasy.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works great on my hair when flat ironed.</li>
      <li>While the spray did smooth, it did not add significant softness or shine.</li>
      <li>Still it worked ok to reduce and contain split ends, but nothing memorable and by the next day I had to use more.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is also great to use when you blow dry your hair or use any heat implements to style your hair.  </li>
      <li>goal for all these hair and skin oils is hair more manageable and softer, which the Argan certainly does.</li>
      <li>It is great for fine hair and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue or weight your hair down.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;For those with a stronger head of hair, with lots of volume and body, or those with heavy curling or frizzy hair, may find that this Moisturizing Oil Spray is ideal when used AS directed.</li>
      <li>Suave product is much, much lighter than most comparable products ...</li>
      <li>Again, go very lightly and you will find soft, smooth hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So if you are like me and you&#x27;ve got bleached hair and you&#x27;re looking for a nice light oil to help give our hair back</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll give this product more of a chance and come back to say more.</li>
      <li>When I first tried the Light Oil Spray, I followed the directions and ended up with oily looking hair.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t much care for the fragrance, a bit too strong and cloying for my taste.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a light oil spray, this one is certainly affordable.</li>
      <li>It smells great too and does make combing my hair a little easier.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really like the weightless and oil free performance of this oil.</li>
      <li>Totally worth it.</li>
      <li>B0045WDQFA Alterna Bamboo Smooth Kendi Oil Dry Oil Mist]] (which is also a natural product and totally amazing!)</li>
      <li>oil lets you style right</li>
      <li>Suave Professionals Natural Infusion Macadamia Oil and White Orchid Light Oil Spray is a product I just love!</li>
      <li>But, if I just put it on the strands and ends, my hair ends up looking very pretty and stays smooth and soft looking throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But this doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down while still providing good conditioning.</li>
      <li>My hair gets weighed down easily and this light oil is really light.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m always looking for a great product that I can use with my flat iron to give my hair back the shine that bleaching has taken away.</li>
      <li>But look elsewhere if you are sensitive to fragrance or have fine hair.</li>
      <li>I may try the Suave Macadamia moisturizing oil spray in this way, first onto the hands and then rubbed into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can lightly spray it on my hair and it will help keep it moisturized and soft.</li>
      <li>You can use this many different ways, as a pre-poo, sealant, serum, etc.....</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is also great for permed and color treated hair and the dry ends that get overworked with a flat iron.</li>
      <li>I really like the smell gorgeous and wet hair, only the price was higher!</li>
      <li>The macadamia oil and white orchid qualities sound very appealing but this product did little to help my hair.  </li>
      <li>but this is a fine, misty, light oil to use in between heavy conditioners and oil treatments.</li>
      <li>I have also tried the WHOLE line of the Suave Professionals Macadamia line.  </li>
      <li>Her hair is very frizzy, and this helps keep it under control.</li>
      <li>I have become a fan of the various \\&quot;leave-in\\&quot; hair products that have become available to improve hair quality and manageability.  </li>
      <li>My hair got oily so fast</li>
      <li>This Suave Infusion Oil gives my hair just a light touch of oil to give it back</li>
      <li>It  caused my hair to look very oily.</li>
      <li>hair feels and looks much smoother after using this.  </li>
      <li>I use heavier Argon oil when I really need some moisture</li>
      <li>I made the error of putting on too much on my scalp and my hair looked and felt like it needed to be washed.  </li>
      <li>Some hair oils are nice, but end up being too oily or make my hair completely limp.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this lite spray</li>
    <li> I really like the smell gorgeous and wet hair, only the price was higher!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair which gets dry and then turns into a hideous ball of frizz. If I want to put in the effort of styling goop and 15 minutes with the hair dryer I get nice curls, if I don&#x27;t have time for that I have to wear a ponytail and a hat to leave the house. This Suave Oil mist gives me a third option I&#x27;ve been wishing for, being able to lightly mist my wet or dry hair, then comb with my fingers, and end up with some decent looking hair. It&#x27;s really not greasy at all. It does smell pretty strongly for the first half hour but then the smell disappears almost completely. My five year old calls it her &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34;, I use it on her hair every single day. Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Really takes care of my fly aways &amp; frizz, however the smell is too strong for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying different serums and smoothers for my damaged hair, and usually they are applied to damp hair and leave my hair feeling greasy within hours.  Even when I use very little!  I tend to like a serum as it helps me untangle my long hair, but the trade off isn&#x27;t really worth it to have greasy hair.  So now I work with a better conditioner, comb it through in the shower before I rinse, and end up with no tangles.  THEN I style it to almost dry and do a light spray of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light spray is much better and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. It adds a nice sheen and a softness that makes it move better when I swing it around.  The price is great too, and the scent of this is just lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only suggestion is to experiment with hairsprays with this:  my regular Bumble and Bumble hairspray didn&#x27;t seem to work well when combined with this (on top)...it seemed to make these little pieces that felt like I was shedding a bit.  Not a huge issue, and it didn&#x27;t happen with a different hairspray, but is something to look out for.  Perhaps it was chemicals interacting somehow.  I so like this alot.</li>
    <li> Applied to damp hair, this product promises to impart moisture, smoothness and softness. I had no difficulty using on my fine, wavy hair. The spray dispensed without issue, no clogging or sticking. I didn&#x27;t much care for the fragrance, a bit too strong and cloying for my taste. While the spray did smooth, it did not add significant softness or shine. It might be more effective on thicker, coarser hair but the impact on mine was minimal. If you are looking for a light oil spray, this one is certainly affordable. But look elsewhere if you are sensitive to fragrance or have fine hair.</li>
    <li> I like this and it works well on my shoulder length hair.  I can be a little sensitive to strong scents but this one is light and smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels and looks much smoother after using this.  I made the error of putting on too much on my scalp and my hair looked and felt like it needed to be washed.  But, if I just put it on the strands and ends, my hair ends up looking very pretty and stays smooth and soft looking throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good price for this type of product and because not a lot is needed for a nice smooth look, this 3oz spray bottle will last for a while.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a product quite like this before. I can lightly spray it on my hair and it will help keep it moisturized and soft. I love the scent! It reminds me more of sandalwood than macadamia nuts and orchids. The scent seems to hold, so it might clash with perfume. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that I can&#x27;t style my hair with hairspray because it won&#x27;t stick. It&#x27;s fine for days when I&#x27;m casual and don&#x27;t have to use hairspray. A tiny bit goes a long way, so it&#x27;s important not to use too much or it will make my hair feel weird. It works well on my granddaughter&#x27;s hair, too. Her hair is very frizzy, and this helps keep it under control.</li>
    <li> My hair is prone to frizziness and breakage. I used this to help tame down some of the frizz and flyaways. I would recommend spraying it from a little bit of a distance and avoiding your roots so it doesn&#x27;t look too oily. I brushed it through with a natural boars hair brush. It has a nice fragrance and did boost the shine. Don&#x27;t overdo it or your hair will look oily, but when used as directed, it does help tame down frizz and increase shine.</li>
    <li> I am cursed with having very fine hair.  A few weeks ago, my hairdresser left my hair color on for a bit too long, and my hair has been extremely dry since then.  I was hoping this would help the day to day appearance of my hair.  Unfortunately, I think my hair is just too fine for this type of product.  No matter how little I applied, my hair still looked greasy.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the petite size of this product discourage you. This small bottle packs a punch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is much less expensive than [[ASIN:B001AO0WCG Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment]] and considerably lighter. In the past, I struggled to apply Moroccan Oil in a manner that didn&#x27;t make my hair look weighed-down or greasy. Even when I used a very, very light touch, it was still a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Suave product is much, much lighter than most comparable products ... it almost makes me think of [[ASIN:B0045WDQFA Alterna Bamboo Smooth Kendi Oil Dry Oil Mist]] (which is also a natural product and totally amazing!) Moreover, it smells awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice would be to begin by using less than you might be inclined to. Again, go very lightly and you will find soft, smooth hair. And, if you use a little too much, hang in there and try it again the next day (maybe try a little [[ASIN:B005UBN2AO Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Dry Shampoo]] to reduce the \\&quot;stringy\\&quot; appearance of using too much). Yes, there is a learning-curve, but once you get it right, your hair will look gorgeous!</li>
    <li> Still it worked ok to reduce and contain split ends, but nothing memorable and by the next day I had to use more. Softened my hair nicely and allowed me to run a brush through my hair easily (brown highlighted blonde with foils, 50 year old, curly, Irish, sometimes flat-ironed/sometimes not, trimmed every other month), which is really all I ask from a leave in oil. I divide my towel dry hair into sections. Spray each section from mid-length of hair to ends and softly comb through for even distribution. Style as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I want I can spray on my dry hair to look new, sleek and shiny. Works great on my hair when flat ironed.</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of Suave and love majority of their hair care products and this oil was no exception.&lt;br /&gt;It has a light pleasant scent which smells really great and not overpowering. Even though this oil is a mist I find it a bit thicker than other oils I usually use, so you might want to go easy on applying it. That&#x27;s just my opinion. You can use this many different ways, as a pre-poo, sealant, serum, etc..... either way it will leave you with great results. Another A+ from me.</li>
    <li> While I like this product and the smell isn&#x27;t too too much (though a bit stronger than I&#x27;d like), I&#x27;m unhappy with how the spray kind of poofs out in a big cloud. I feel like it&#x27;s getting everywhere--furniture, mirrors, my clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a good job of smoothing frizzy hair, and adds a nice, light shine.

    <li> I have been dealing with the winter weather, which has been harsh on my hair. Of course, living in Missouri, all seasons seem to be harsh on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This light oil adds just a touch (I spray lightly) of oil to help control my hair, and adds a very nice scent that accompanies me through out the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure that I would like this - mostly because I thought it would make my hair oily. But the spritzer lets me just spray a touch on and comb it in. I am impressed. Nice.</li>
    <li> Smells soooo good!!! I always love using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I also like how the mist is a fine spray.&lt;br /&gt;When my hair is frizzy, I use this to calm it down.  Works well, I just wish I had a bigger bottle.&lt;br /&gt;mostly 5 stars because of the scent.</li>
    <li> Suave Professionals Natural Infusion Macadamia Oil and White Orchid Light Oil Spray is a product I just love! I apply this on my hair while it&#x27;s still damp before I dry it and style it. When I&#x27;m finished styling my hair I rub a few pumps of this product in my hands, rub them together and apply a light layer over my hair for extra sheen and more control of my frizzies without looking greasy. And the fragrance is to die for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Suave Professionals Natural Infusion line of products are simply amazing and think they&#x27;re better than Pantene!</li>
    <li> This is a light spray that adds oil to your hair. I like that it is apparently non-toxic and does not smell like perfume. Unfortunately, it did not help my hair, which is quite fine. I was hoping it would help the dry fly-aways but instead it separated the strands, looking rather messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance, although quite light, lingered until I washed my hair. It reminds me of coconut, which gets tiresome after a while. I probably won&#x27;t continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing spray does have a strong fragrance and can be used on either damp or dry hair. If you follow the directions you will be lightly spraying sections of the hair and then comb the macadamia-infused oil through your hair. As I have very fine hair, the flyaway and easily snarled this is simply too much spray, almost to the point of making it stiff with the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following week I used it each time as just a light spritzing over the head, combed, and left it that way, without the amount suggested. That left just enough conditioning to make it easier to comb but in terms of overall effectiveness did not come close to what I use regularly, an Argan oil which is rubbed into the hands and then run through the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The goal for all these hair and skin oils is hair more manageable and softer, which the Argan certainly does. I may try the Suave Macadamia moisturizing oil spray in this way, first onto the hands and then rubbed into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those with a stronger head of hair, with lots of volume and body, or those with heavy curling or frizzy hair, may find that this Moisturizing Oil Spray is ideal when used AS directed. It will be interesting (to me anyway!) to read other reviews from those with something other than fine hair as to their results.</li>
    <li> With all the heat products I use on my hair this is a nice refreshing oil. I use heavier Argon oil when I really need some moisture but this is a fine, misty, light oil to use in between heavy conditioners and oil treatments. I like the way this infusion works when I just need a little moisture boost on dry or wet hair. The scent of the White Orchid is very nice and gives your hair a great scent as well as some shine and conditioning in between washings and damaged hair treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also great for permed and color treated hair and the dry ends that get overworked with a flat iron. This product fills a gap between heavier oils and conditioning and adds some shine and softness for in between treatments when hair just needs a little boost. You can&#x27;t beat the price and the smell is very refreshing. Great product!</li>
    <li> This delightfully scented oil gives parched hair a sheen, and doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.&lt;br /&gt;If your hair (like mine) is fragile and hard to work with when just shampooed, a tiny bit of this on the ends helps with styling.&lt;br /&gt;Ever notice how your hair stays in an up-do better the day AFTER you shampoo?&lt;br /&gt;This oil lets you style right away.&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution, a little goes a long way, otherwise you get that dreaded greasy look</li>
    <li> My hair gets weighed down easily and this light oil is really light. It adds a bit of shine, not quite as glossy as a glossing spray but just a nice healthy looking shine. It smells great too and does make combing my hair a little easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It reminds me of detangling sprays but in a grown up formulation with a nice light scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a product that I will buy in the future. Using it with a conditioner helps improve the look of my hair, and makes it easier to style and comb.</li>
    <li> When I first tried the Light Oil Spray, I followed the directions and ended up with oily looking hair. I told my hair dresser about it and she said not to follow the directions but to spray a tiny bit on the palms of my hands and then work it in. Her advice gave me the results I wanted and a nice shine. Sadly, but following the directions, I would have ended up never using this again. !</li>
    <li> Initially I loved this item. It smelled great, made my hair look shiny... Until noon. That&#x27;s when I noticed it was a little *too* shiny. My hair got oily so fast this was hardly worth it after four dry, winter days of using it. I had to put it in the trash. Sorry Suave. It smells awesome, though!</li>
    <li> I straighten my hair once a week and in between I use a curling iron on my ends to keep my hair smooth. This spray works well for the in between but be careful not to use too much. It  caused my hair to look very oily. I now spray it between my palms and rub on my hair. I get much better results.</li>
    <li> I have become a fan of the various \\&quot;leave-in\\&quot; hair products that have become available to improve hair quality and manageability.  I have to rate this one by Suave,though, in the just \\&quot;OK\\&quot; category.  The macadamia oil and white orchid qualities sound very appealing but this product did little to help my hair.  For a similar moderate to low priced product I prefer Pantene Pro-V Heat Shield HeatPotion Serum.  That product is currently just a bit more expensive on Amazon than this one by Suave.  The Pantene is priced as of the writing of this review  at $4.49 for 1.7 oz while the Suave is going for $6.99 for a 3 fluid ounce bottle.</li>
    <li> This is surprisingly light - I&#x27;ve tried the Tresemme and other oils and they tend to make my hair flat and greasy. But this doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down while still providing good conditioning. I was surprisingly impressed since this is the only oil treatment to make my hair look good.</li>
    <li> I use a variety of different products on my hair.  A lot promise big but do not deliver.  I found Suave professionals natural infusion Macadamia Oil to be a great product.  it goes on easily and weigh down your hair.  The fragrance is excellent!&lt;br /&gt;One suggestion - the instructions say 2-3 sprays on each section of hair.....  That is over spraying in my opinion after using it.  It&#x27;s very effective without having to use that much!!!</li>
    <li> I have purchased several Suave Professionals products and have really experienced great success with them.  I have also tried the WHOLE line of the Suave Professionals Macadamia line.  I really like the weightless and oil free performance of this oil. It is great for fine hair and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue or weight your hair down.  I like to spray the product DIRECTLY into my hands and then run my fingers through my hair.  I have short hair and use three pumps into my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also great to use when you blow dry your hair or use any heat implements to style your hair.  All in all, a GREAT product at a great price!</li>
    <li> The best conditioner is a wash and water.  Somehow this other stuff seems to make my hair feel not so clean and heavyish.  I&#x27;ll give this product more of a chance and come back to say more.</li>
    <li> My hair has been bleached blonde from it&#x27;s natural deep brown color. And my hair is very thick and long. So between my hair being bleached, it&#x27;s length and it&#x27;s the thickness, my hair ends up a huge poofy mess if I don&#x27;t tame it before and after blow drying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always looking for a great product that I can use with my flat iron to give my hair back the shine that bleaching has taken away. Some hair oils are nice, but end up being too oily or make my hair completely limp. This Suave Infusion Oil gives my hair just a light touch of oil to give it back it&#x27;s shine, but doesn&#x27;t over do it to make my hair limp or greasy. I especially like applying it to the ends of my hair where my hair is it&#x27;s driest. A few spritz of this and some passes of the flat iron over my hair and my dry poofy hair is tamed and shiny again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are like me and you&#x27;ve got bleached hair and you&#x27;re looking for a nice light oil to help give our hair back it&#x27;s shine, without making it look greasy, this Suave Infusion Oil is an awesome choice.</li>
    <li> Our family gave this a try and love it.  My daughter is the biggest fan.  A quick spray gives her some additional shine and softness, and leaves her hair smoother and more managable.  On top of that, it smells great, and doesn&#x27;t feel wet or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a heavy product, but I think that&#x27;s part of its strength.  Strongly recommended for people who are looking for a light hair treatment</li>
