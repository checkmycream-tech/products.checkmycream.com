      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about getting perfume that was new-in-box, but this smells like the genuine thing and didn&#x27;t appear to have any missing.</li>

      <li>My mother has been wearing this Estee Lauder fragrance since 1990, and it never gets old.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, flowery, and not strong for those of us who don&#x27;t want to smell like bug spray.</li>
      <li>bottle is huge and will last a long time and a lot cheaper than buying it in local stores.</li>

    <li> I ordered the Beautiful by Estee Lauder as a Christmas gift for a favorite aunt. I was a bit concerned by the (unboxed) notation in the description, as I feared it might be \\&quot;old\\&quot; (outdated).  My fears proved to be unfounded - there was no lack of quality, only the lack of the box.  Even better, not only did it arrive on time and in great condition, but I also saved $20 over the instore price.</li>
    <li> The purfume arrived faster than I expected.  Very pleased with the price of the item and was the same quality  as if I had paid full price.</li>
    <li> I have loved Beautiful by Estee Lauder for years but the price kept going up and up in the Department Stores now I love being able to purchase it in the big bottle with BIG savings without the outer box I don&#x27;t use the box so I am thrilled with this oppotunity. :)</li>
    <li> all was great, product worked as expected and required. Price was good, planning on refilling when run out of pro</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about getting perfume that was new-in-box, but this smells like the genuine thing and didn&#x27;t appear to have any missing. For the price break, I thought it was worth a try and I&#x27;m glad I did give it a go.</li>
    <li> Needed to purchase Beautiful Estee Lauder Perfume for my birthday. I was out and looked at other sites for the same deal. It was they had none or it was very expensive. So what- it had no box. I purchased just the perfume. Great deal and great products.</li>
    <li> I love Estee Lauders &amp;#34;Beautiful Eau de Parfum Spray&amp;#34;, however, the one sent to me does not hold the fragrance like all of the rest of the same Parfums I purchased in a store...this one came without the box but the bottle is the same as all of the rest of them...This was my mom&#x27;s favorite Parfum and that is how I got it in the first place...from now on I will purchase this item in a department store...price was same as regular store...I would always have friends say how good it smells and I could smell it all day on me...now, about an hour or so after spraying, I can&#x27;t smell it...</li>
    <li> GREAT AMAZON TRANSACTION &amp; EXCELLENT PRODUCT!  THANKS!</li>
    <li> Great price and fast shipment on my mother&#x27;s signature fragrance.  My mother has been wearing this Estee Lauder fragrance since 1990, and it never gets old.  This was a gift for her 90th birthday, and as always she is never disappointed.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite and ALWAYS receive nice compliments when wearing it. It&#x27;s light, flowery, and not strong for those of us who don&#x27;t want to smell like bug spray.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my girlfriend and she loves it.  It was the fragrance that her mother used.  I enjoy it on her.</li>
    <li> Have been using Beautiful for years...great experience with the order.  Wrong size sent at first, but was later made correct.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before. I knew that I would enjoy it and I certainly do. Also my husband really likes it too. It is his favorite of all the fragrances I have used over the years.</li>
    <li> My wife asked for this for Christmas.  Looked locally but it was cheaper to buy on Amazon.  It was unboxed so that probably accounts for the price difference.  It all smells the same so if this is a favorite of yours why not save some money?</li>
    <li> It did not matter to me that this product came without a box. I wasn&#x27;t going to keep the box anyway.  Nor was it going to be a gift, it was for me.  I absolutely adore the fragrance and couldn&#x27;t afford it if I had not seen it on Amazon. It was wrapped properly and was in excellent condition when I received it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter. She was buying some cheap generic scent at some discount store somewhere and I could not stand the smell so I offered to buy her some premium perfume and she chose this.  I wore it years ago and I loved it.  Now when she walks in the room and it trails after her, I give a big sigh of relief and get to smell how wonderful this is.  We love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is huge and will last a long time and a lot cheaper than buying it in local stores.</li>
    <li> i ordered this item for mw wife in our anniversary ,i liked ,i ordered a bottle with no box because it is a little bit cheaper than the boxed one but the nice surprise i recieved a very good boxed item ,i&#x27;ll recommend buying this item from this seller for all my friends</li>
    <li> I will be buying online more often. I hesitated on buying online but my product arrived within a few days and is everything I wanted</li>
    <li> WARNING....This perfume is a knock off. Do not purchase from this buyer...i compared it to the purfume i got from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I ordered this late for Mother&#x27;s Day for my wife and yet the item arrived in time, She loved the fragrance and uses it almost daily. Thanks for the quick delivery</li>
    <li> Instead of the 2.5 oz spray, it was a 1 oz spray with a 1.5 oz lotion. The lotion seemed old and had an odd odor.</li>
