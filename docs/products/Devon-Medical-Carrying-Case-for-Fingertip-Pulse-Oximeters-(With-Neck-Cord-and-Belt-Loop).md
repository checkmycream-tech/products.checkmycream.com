      <li>It&#x27;s the best little holder ever.</li>
      <li>It is accurate and convenient to carry.</li>
      <li>She tell me that it&#x27;s accurate and reliable.</li>
      <li>but i feel that it looks and feels cheap and tinny.  </li>

      <li>When  any  patient  displays  untoward  signs, I  have this instrument  instantly  available for a  reading.</li>
      <li>I had been happily using this on the strap of my bag that I carry for work, but today, the bag swung in such a way that the flap scraped by my leg, the velcro  ripped apart and</li>

      <li>you very much judy</li>

      <li>and it sure have been a help to me,as it shows your heart rate at the same</li>
      <li>This product is exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Protects the unit, comes with a lanyard, and is an interesting, sort of shimmery shade of blue.</li>
      <li>With an adult dissabled child with frequent health issues, it&#x27;s nice to be able to monitor all the little things when you are trying to determine whether or not his lastest issue is something you can deal with at home or if it&#x27;s time for the emergancy room.</li>
      <li>This little Devon medical pulse reader is great, can carry in your pocket</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The nurses monitor all the vitals except blood oxygen.  I can just sing it out without special attention. It works great!</li>
    <li> It is well built, it can be hung around the neck, and the  oximeter I got fits perfectly.</li>
    <li> I bought this item to protect my pulse oximeter.  It is far from a perfect fit.  It is larger and hence allows the expensive Nonin oximeter to move around in the case.</li>
    <li> Producto muy bueno, bonito case para proteger y guardar el Oximeters, color muy bonito, excelente producto, muy satisfecho con mi compra.</li>
    <li> i bought this case to protect my investment in a pulse/ox and can not beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> The oximeter fits in the case very well. Now I do not have to worry about the oximeter getting dusty and dirty.</li>
    <li> I received this item in excellent condition and I want to say that it does all that I want it to do.  Thank you.  I would order again from this company.</li>
    <li> I bought this to hold my [[ASIN:B002BUYSDC Fingertip Pulse Oximeter]] and it fits like a glove.  Very well made and comes with a neck strap too.  What more can I say? It&#x27;s more convenient than keeping my pulse oximeter in the box, and this helps keep the dust off it too.  Oh, and it&#x27;s inexpensive -- like I said... perfect!</li>
    <li> Great protection for my pulse ox. Light weight, long strap in case you care to use it. Mainly, it fits and does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> Product was as described and at a fair price.  Well pleased and would order from this company again</li>
    <li> We had an older style Pulse Ox machine that stoped working.  This one fills the bill although we have not calibrated it against a more expensive machine.  However for the $$ we are also thinking of getting one a a field back-up for our local rescue squad.  One thing, it comes with a case so there is no reason to spend 5 of 6 dallars extra for the case.  Nothing was mentioned about the unit coming with a case in the add.  Bob</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I wanted. I would recommend to everyone. The carrying case fit perfectly. I have used for the past few weeks and am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Has the look of something made by children. The hanging loop is in the middle of the back so it hangs in a prone position, very annoying. No padding, so not much help in a drop.</li>
    <li> I purchased the carrying case with the monitor. The case works fine and fits the product very good. The monitor works well when holding your hand up with your elbow bent. If you put your arm down and walk it tends to not read. You need to hold it on with one of your other fingers for it to work while walking.</li>
    <li> Having had lung problems and oxygen problems, this little tiny piece of equipment has finally put to rest insurance questions about payment for home oxygen. It has also put my mind to rest about just how severe my oxygen levels are at diverse times of day. Thank you for putting it out there!</li>
    <li> this item was a waste of my money,it was not needed because pulse oximeter that I ordered came with a carrying case,although that was not mentioned on your site when i ordered the pulse oximeter.</li>
    <li> The carrying case fits the pulse oximeter that I purchased perfectly. The construction is of good quality and looks exactly like the photo.</li>
    <li> The case works well when it is new. With frequent use the velcro wears out. Had to replace it after about 6 months..</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised,easy to set up with enclosed batteries, works well, O2 sat reading equal to that of same test in doctor&#x27;s office. Well pleased with ease to work with.</li>
    <li> I bought this last year and the case looks like I just bought it. Like the color blue. Yes I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Its a great case for holding a oximeter.</li>
    <li> I ordered this case with the pulse-oximeter order but when they were delivered I found a case included in the pulse-oximeter package!  I didn&#x27;t want to go to the trouble of returning it so this case is still sitting in the original wrapper, unopened and un-needed....</li>
    <li> my sister recently had to go on oxygen and the doctor suggested she get an oximeter because her oxygen levels were critical at times.i was amazed when i found these at amazon. com for the price.i took one to my doctors office and compared the readings with a very expensive one the professionals use.this one is just as good as the high priced ones are!!!!.and they are so convenient.i would reccomended these to anybody who has oxygen needs.it has helped my sister and my friend know when they need oxygen. i have heart disease and it sure have been a help to me,as it shows your heart rate at the same time.thank you very much judy</li>
    <li> the lanyard provided with the case needs to be longer and more importantly the plastic clip on the lanyard is such poor quality that the lanyard probably should not have been included in the box with the carrying case.</li>
    <li> there were all just great</li>
    <li> Needed this p. ox to check my patient&#x27;s p. ox but it checks heart rate and can tell if rate is reg or irreg.  Best investment I&#x27;ve ever made.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered the Fingertip pulse oximeter with the carrying case. It is the ideal size for my pocket and now is always available when needed. Another coworker has one and feels the same way. It is easy to operate, the batteries last long and it stores easily in the small carrying case.  Ideal for office work.  MJ</li>
    <li> The Devon Medical Carrying Case for Fingertip Pulse Oximeters is ideal for use anytime, especially when working in the yard, shopping or traveling. Excellent price, as well! The neck cord and belt loop give you options other than carrying in your purse or pocket. Convenient, easy to use, without excess bulk. If you buy the meter, be sure to get the case.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Perfect for home care givers and their loves ones who are home bound on oxygen.  Love it so.</li>
    <li> I have two of these, one with a Devon Oxymeter and one with a no name Oxymeter.  They work great for keeping it handy around your neck and protecting the unit from damage.</li>
    <li> It worked for only one day and didn&#x27;t work again ( even changed the batteries)</li>
    <li> Easy to load &amp; keep secure</li>
    <li> I use this all the time to keep track of my oxygen level.  It gives a quick and accurate reading everytime.</li>
    <li> Good cover, protecs oximeter well, good fit, nice color, neck cord is helpfull, light weigthed. Rating text with extremelly boring and demanding rules.</li>
    <li> Got this for my nurse wife and she uses it daily. She tell me that it&#x27;s accurate and reliable. She uses it on patients with her home health profession.</li>
    <li> I had been happily using this on the strap of my bag that I carry for work, but today, the bag swung in such a way that the flap scraped by my leg, the velcro  ripped apart and my pulse ox fell onto a tile floor. Fortunately I heard it land, but if it has fallen on grass or the environment had been noisy, I would have lost my pulse ox and had to explain it to my employer.  I think I&#x27;ll have to return the cover.</li>
    <li> The carrying case is well designed and will protect the Oximeter from damage, and accidental activation while in a dresser drawer.</li>
    <li> Is perfect for the pulse oximeter I bought. It fits perfect and I can keep it safe. Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> Pretty useless and bulky addition to a cheap oximeter.  Putting in your pocket makes more sense.</li>
    <li> A necessity in my home .</li>
    <li> This little guy is keeping me healthy and keeping me out of the hospital by keeping track of my numbers and if the readings are low I can do some deep breathes and get the numbers up where they need to be ....When your numbers are low and you dont reaize it until your in a deep sleep and your face is turning blue (POUT).all of a sudden you wake up in ICU wearing a O2 face mask and your fingers are wired to monitors ....it was not fun...this gadget has improved my life and is keeping me out of emergency !</li>
    <li> This item was shipped quickly.  Upon inspection when the carrying case arrived, right away you could see the great craftsmanship used to make it.  Strong materials, sown professionally and will last for years.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great for exercising and great if you need to keep an eye on your oxygen levels.  Small, compact, excellent price.  Bought two, one for myself and one for my husband.  Highly recommend and would give it 6 stars if possible.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this carrying case. It seems to be durable and I like that it came with a lanyard/neck cord.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to monitor my heart rate and oxygen.  It has been indispensible.  It is very accurate as well.  I tested mine while I was in the emergency room.  It was right on the mark!  The batteries lasted forever as well.  The only problem I encountered was when I went to change the batteries.  The batteries both go in the same direction as opposed to the standard of + - and - +.  Also, the side of the batterie which is commonly used as the positive (nipple end) had to be placed in the case where one usually places the flat side of the battery. I tried 6 or 8 batteries before I realized you had to place the batteries in backwards.  I don&#x27;t know if the problem occurs in all devices, but it was worth noting in case anyone else runs into the same problem.</li>
    <li> This fingerpulse oximeter is adequate in a pinch but i feel that it looks and feels cheap and tinny.  I would pay for a&lt;br /&gt;better quality next time around.</li>
    <li> This case is just the right size for the pulse oximeter that I purchased. The hook &amp; loop closure makes it easy to access. Love the neck cord, so you always have it available when needed.</li>
    <li> Great case for most oximeters.  Protects the unit, comes with a lanyard, and is an interesting, sort of shimmery shade of blue.</li>
    <li> Did not know the oximeter I ordered came with the carrying case (pouch) and etc.  But I may have over looked it. Seems to be a nice pouch.</li>
    <li> This item is a perfect fit for the finger tip pulse oximeter. It protects it and is easy to remove and put away. I am able to move from room to room or to and from the car with it on the neck cord. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Nice simple little pouch that fits the Nonin Go2 Achieve I purchased.  It says Devon on the front, but it protects the $100 pulse Ox quite well.</li>
    <li> This little case fits the oximeter perfectly and it makes it very handy to protect it.  The price was right too!</li>
    <li> GREAT, STILL WORKING ( 3 ) YEARS</li>
    <li> It did not fit well. It was too tight and unable to be used. I just ended up throwing the case away. It would have cost me more to return it than I paid for the case and it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> It is  so handy to have  this on my  person at  all times. When  any  patient  displays  untoward  signs, I  have this instrument  instantly  available for a  reading. My  nurse  friends are  always running to me  to  borrow it.</li>
    <li> sometimes it is difficult in registering right away. have to move from finger to finger, but it does the job</li>
    <li> Product shipped as described works well would recommend this product to anybody who uses a pulse oximeter. Product is sturdy and well constructed, price was great</li>
    <li> Love my carrying case I use it while I exercise to hold my pulse oximeter, now i am able to check my heart rate during exercise. It&#x27;s the best little holder ever.</li>
    <li> My son has had major lung/health issues since he was a newborn.  During the night we would not know when to take him to the hospital and when he was OK.  So we purchased this to help us know what his oxygen levels were.  It has saved us so many trips to the ER and also helped us know when to take him.  I highly recommend this if you need to know basic oxygen levels.  It is sensitive so if the child moves around a lot it won&#x27;t give an accurate reading but if they are still (i.e. asleep) it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I ordered this case to keep my son&#x27;s pulse oximeter in and it fits perfectly. It arrived quickly and is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> My wife had a lung disease (non smoker) and the meter helped to show her blood oxygen.  The case was handy when she went out to protect her meter.  It&#x27;s not necessary to have a case, but it&#x27;s your preference.</li>
    <li> This little Devon medical pulse reader is great, can carry in your pocket it&#x27;s great and works well and accurate, thank you</li>
    <li> Great product, great price</li>
    <li> Just perfect. I love it.</li>
    <li> Not much to say, it holds my Pulse Oximeter to my belt and makes it easy to get out when needed.</li>
    <li> This product is working great so far. With an adult dissabled child with frequent health issues, it&#x27;s nice to be able to monitor all the little things when you are trying to determine whether or not his lastest issue is something you can deal with at home or if it&#x27;s time for the emergancy room. Things like this make life so much easier and can save a bundle in hospital bills, if you know what you are doing.</li>
    <li> Great product for the money. It is accurate and convenient to carry. I have compared the accuracy to my doctors equipment and it was the same.</li>
    <li> It is the exact size for my new pulse oximeter.</li>
    <li> Was just what we expected. Made the Oximeter easy to use on walks in the mall,around the neighborhood and on the treadmill.</li>
    <li> This case is fine for most pulse oximeters, It has a cord which is very useful.  I am able to have it with me at all times. I feel it is very sturdy and the pulse oximeter is safe in it.</li>
    <li> As described, my finger pulse ox by Santa Medical is a perfect fit! great price, great protection ! ! !</li>
    <li> This really didn&#x27;t work for what I wanted it for so not sure how to rate it so I hate to rate it.</li>
