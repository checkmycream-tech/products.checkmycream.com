      <li>cause it&#x27;s so good!!</li>
      <li>Perfect make up to cover freckles!</li>
      <li>Wonderful product I&#x27;ve used for years but wish they would come out with lighter shades for fair complexions, etc. etc.</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>most of all, it&#x27;s so moist!!</li>
      <li>Product arrived in time and in good condition.</li>
      <li>It is a good peoduct</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s a really good product and has a powdery finish.</li>
      <li>Love this makeup have been wearing it for years and looks great on.  </li>
      <li>Love it, good coverage n get good price.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>A nice product to lighten up around the eyes and imperfections on your face.</li>
      <li>Please change the bottle to pumping kind of thing...</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, if you&#x27;re looking for a good foundation from drugstore, it&#x27;s really worth it!!</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and looks good all day.  </li>
      <li>You just roll it on:)</li>
      <li>/&gt;it works better with my fingers..</li>
      <li>It evens your skin tone, moisturizers, and leaves you with a lovely , dewy finish that lasts all day.</li>
      <li>I have so many foundations..</li>
      <li>I love, love LOVE this foundation.</li>
      <li>I love this makeup.</li>
      <li>I love it because you don&#x27;t need a brush to apply it...</li>
      <li>Light in color and in texture.</li>
      <li>except the color is too light for me.</li>
      <li>and light to medium</li>
      <li>I bought it a bit lighter than I used to buy foundation (on the advice of my very fashionable teen daughter) and it is perfect.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply; even full coverage.</li>
      <li>I just wanted to clean the sponge with the tissue and</li>
      <li>(I don&#x27;t know the exact name</li>
      <li>But not a problem, I use this to blend my denser foundations and together I get exactly the coverage and color</li>
      <li>I use more than one concealer, and this is my least favorite.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon for carrying this</li>
      <li>really...</li>
      <li>Its very reaonsonably priced too.</li>
      <li>but this is really comparable to many other high-end ones.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;it feels so smooth like silky texture? and spread evenly and lasts long, too!</li>
      <li>pretty much of the product was left on  this</li>
      <li>Unless you have severe skin imperfections that require a thick, heavy-duty liquid make-up, you will probably love this.</li>
      <li>Really enjoy the painted effect I get from the sponge applicator, it smooths on just enough make up to cover well but not be heavy.</li>
      <li>on another day after using this, I&#x27;d just squeezed the sponge with my fingers  just to see how much product would be left on the sponge, and there was quite a lot of them left in the sponge...</li>
      <li>It would cover so good without feeling heavy and thick.</li>

    <li> Perfect make up to cover freckles!</li>
    <li> Great product!!! I love it because you don&#x27;t need a brush to apply it... You just roll it on:)</li>
    <li> except the color is too light for me. Light in color and in texture. But not a problem, I use this to blend my denser foundations and together I get exactly the coverage and color I want.  I will order again in this color to continue my dual application.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product I&#x27;ve used for years but wish they would come out with lighter shades for fair complexions, etc. etc.</li>
    <li> Love it, good coverage n get good price. Thanks Amazon for carrying this</li>
    <li> This&#x27;s for daily make up</li>
    <li> A nice product to lighten up around the eyes and imperfections on your face.</li>
    <li> I have so many foundations..really... but this is really comparable to many other high-end ones.&lt;br /&gt;it feels so smooth like silky texture? and spread evenly and lasts long, too! most of all, it&#x27;s so moist!! and light to medium coverage.&lt;br /&gt;Only one thing I don&#x27;t like about it is this sponge thing like applicator, I hope they change this to pump thing..&lt;br /&gt;because one time after I used it I just wanted to clean the sponge with the tissue and pretty much of the product was left on  this sponge.&lt;br /&gt;and on another day after using this, I&#x27;d just squeezed the sponge with my fingers  just to see how much product would be left on the sponge, and there was quite a lot of them left in the sponge...&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to waste any of it cause it&#x27;s so good!! Please change the bottle to pumping kind of thing...(I don&#x27;t know the exact name..?)&lt;br /&gt;After I apply to my skin I use my fingers to spread all over my face, I don&#x27;t use this applicator use spread all over..&lt;br /&gt;it works better with my fingers..&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you&#x27;re looking for a good foundation from drugstore, it&#x27;s really worth it!!</li>
