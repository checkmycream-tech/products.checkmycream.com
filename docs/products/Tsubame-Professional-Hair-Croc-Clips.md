      <li>Love  , theyre awesome</li>
      <li>love them, they work great!</li>
      <li>These are very strong durable clips!</li>
      <li>As a professional, I am VERY happy with the quality of these for the price!!</li>
      <li>Strong hold!</li>
      <li>Very light weight, they don&#x27;t pull on the hair</li>
      <li>They grip better than claw clips and are easier to slide in, too, when I am trying to get through this mop in a hurry.  </li>
      <li>These don&#x27;t have the alligator teeth and don&#x27;t do a group job of gripping the hair.</li>
      <li>Seem to be a great value so far!</li>
      <li>I am amazed how something of this quality is available so cheap !</li>
      <li>These are great, especially for the price.  </li>
      <li>Great product, especially for the price.  </li>
      <li>Easy to clean and take care of.</li>
      <li>These are amazing, I&#x27;ll be able to do more with these clips than the other clips I have.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even need to use more than one clip to hold a large section of hair out of my way (shoulder length hair).</li>
      <li>but they don&#x27;t have that cool rubbery coating which is probably inconsequential anyway.</li>
      <li>The shipping was quick.</li>
      <li>I was at first unsure if these clips would be durable.</li>
      <li>Absolutely can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
      <li>First time I tried these type clips.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got a TON of hair and these make styling it so much easier!  </li>
      <li>I have super long and thick hair, and it holds it perfectly in place.</li>
      <li>These clips are big, sturdy and have fantastic grip on the hair.</li>
      <li>It worked very well.  </li>
      <li>These clips hold hair very well.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>These have as much tension as the color trak ones</li>
      <li>so they are very comftorable.</li>
      <li>I really like them.</li>
      <li>I do a lot of natural kinky/curly hair, these clips aren&#x27;t strong enough to hold the hair.</li>
      <li>Before buying these I had bought some cheap clips that increased by &#x27;blowdrying&#x27; time by constantly slipping in between sections.</li>
      <li>They may look flimsy compared to the expensive clips BUT they are sturdy and works great with section inch thick hair:)</li>
      <li>I highly recommend croc clips for sectioning large bundles of long hair.    </li>
      <li>These alligator clips work great for getting long, thick hair out of the way, while you blow dry and straighten your curly locks.</li>
      <li>These are the only clips that can hold my natural hair in place!</li>

<li> These are the only clips that can hold my natural hair in place!</li>
<li> A way better deal than the casual croc clip package you see at Walmart, which are 2 clips for 4 bucks.  </li>
<li> I like the black clips over my silver that I normally use</li>
<li> Use multiple if hair is super thick!</li>
<li> After extensive use of both brands in the aforementioned, I realize that the coating on the color traks help for grip when your hands are wet with product, which is a big deal for me.</li>
<li> However if there is any product on your hands the grooves on the handle portion are not adequate enough to stop your fingers from sliding .</li>
<li> I used these once a week for about a 8 months and all but 3 are broken but for the price who&#x27;s really complaining....</li>
<li> I have very thick 4b-4c natural hair</li>
<li> The design is similar to other Croc clips, but when I use them on thick hair, the grip is not as tight.</li>
<li> Other clicks pop or won&#x27;t close!</li>
<li> On several occasions, a few of them broke under the stress of thick hair.    </li>
<li> In the 6 months that I&#x27;ve had them, only one has broken.  </li>
<li> The end is weak.</li>

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold enough hair. The end is weak.</li>
    <li> I was at first unsure if these clips would be durable. For the price I paid, I&#x27;m not complaining! They may look flimsy compared to the expensive clips BUT they are sturdy and works great with section inch thick hair:)</li>
    <li> The design is similar to other Croc clips, but when I use them on thick hair, the grip is not as tight. So the hair is still sliding out of place.</li>
    <li> Love  , theyre awesome and they came in on time</li>
    <li> Loved it! Especially for the price</li>

    <li> Love!!! Students at my school keep asking me where I got them!!!</li>
    <li> These are the only clips that can hold my natural hair in place! Other clicks pop or won&#x27;t close! I probably will be ordering another pack just for when I do my friends&#x27; hair!</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve got a TON of hair and these make styling it so much easier!  They grip better than claw clips and are easier to slide in, too, when I am trying to get through this mop in a hurry.  I use them when I&#x27;m blow drying or curling my hair.</li>
    <li> Used this product while I was in Afghanistan to separate my hair on wash days.  It worked very well.  I have very thick 4b-4c natural hair and it can hold my hair in 4 sections with no problem.  In the 6 months that I&#x27;ve had them, only one has broken.  I would definitely recommend to a friend!!</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t have the alligator teeth and don&#x27;t do a group job of gripping the hair.</li>
    <li> These are very strong durable clips! Work wonderful! Keep hair clipped up! Use multiple if hair is super thick! Thanks</li>
    <li> Great product, especially for the price.  I have super long and thick hair, and it holds it perfectly in place.</li>
    <li> First time I tried these type clips. I really like them. Hold the hair well. I like the black clips over my silver that I normally use, I end up throwing my silver clips away with my foils. With these I don&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist and regular clips sometimes just doesn&#x27;t cut it. These are amazing, I&#x27;ll be able to do more with these clips than the other clips I have. I&#x27;d suggest these clips to my hairstylist friends.</li>
    <li> The shipping was quick. I do a lot of natural kinky/curly hair, these clips aren&#x27;t strong enough to hold the hair. They are flimsy.</li>
    <li> These alligator clips work great for getting long, thick hair out of the way, while you blow dry and straighten your curly locks.</li>
