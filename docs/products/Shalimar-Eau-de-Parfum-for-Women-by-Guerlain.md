      <li>I have loved Shalimar since my teens and I am delighted with my purchase.  </li>
      <li>and my wife loved it</li>
      <li>AAA Perfume Merchants filled my order perfectly and it was received almost immediately</li>
      <li>She loved it.</li>
      <li>EdT - a sweet vanillic, easy-to-wear wonder, but not long-lasting - best for those who like gourmands but something easier to wear than an EdP oriental.</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly and in perfect condition...</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with service.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
      <li>is that it blends with a woman&#x27;s own body chemistry to give the wearer the wonderful scent of Shalimar with one&#x27;s own unique essence.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more at Amazon!</li>
      <li>Shalimar is awesome and an must try for anyone interested in fragrances.</li>
      <li>The classics are always a good, safe bet when buying a fragrance for others.</li>
      <li>What we received came in came in a nice spray bottle just like what I ordered, Shailmar labels and all.  </li>
      <li>It is a superior product and one of the things I love about this essence</li>
      <li>We all have our own tastes in perfumes.</li>
      <li>Amazingly it was fresh and beautiful.</li>
      <li>I am allergic to many of today&#x27;s popular fragrances but have never had a problem with Shalimar.</li>
      <li>This, by far, was the BEST DEAL!!</li>
      <li>I used to buy Shalimar for my wife many years ago and thought it might be a nice idea to start the habit again.</li>
      <li>It was a gift for my wife&#x27;s birthday and  timely delivery was very important.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this beautiful scent to any woman who is looking for a perfume that is elegant, sensual and classic.  </li>
      <li>I am a bargin shopper and did a lot of research on where I could get the better bargin.  </li>
      <li>This bottle was $60 more at the department store.  </li>
      <li>I am safe for another year.  </li>
      <li>I love Shalimar.  </li>
      <li>It is my favorite</li>
      <li>This is of course, believable.</li>
      <li>Shalimar is my favorite fragrance</li>
      <li>for the woman you love, intoxicating</li>
      <li>Better in vintage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I made the purchase at the end of March to make sure I had it in time.</li>
      <li>Also cheaper and easier to find on Amazon than in most places.</li>
      <li>This is her favorite perfume</li>
      <li>I still love the fragrance, but this bottle didn&#x27;t  capture the essence of the fragrance at all.</li>
      <li>I have worn Shalimar perfume for more than 40 years.  </li>
      <li>and I was delighted to find it here at such a good price.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The EdP - an oriental vanilla with a classic progression from top to bottom, simply gorgeous, long-lasting all-day commitment.</li>
      <li>Was delighted to find it at Amazon at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>, seductive, rich, exquisite&lt;br /&gt;she&#x27;ll thank you for it in many ways&lt;</li>
      <li>I love the way this scent envelops me without being overpoweringly sweet or floral.</li>
      <li>and she has worn no other perfune since,  she says its simply the best she has even used!</li>
      <li>- I will definitely use this site again and tell everyone what a great experience I had with Amazon and AAA - Thanks again!</li>
      <li>Like some kind of old rotten wood/pines.</li>
      <li>received quickly</li>
      <li>I cannot say enough about how pleased I am with this shopping experience!  </li>
      <li>Amazing, the same product for about 1/2 the price!  </li>
      <li>I am thrilled with the savings and the quality, and can say the same about all my purchases from Amazon.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not just beautiful, but evocative of sentimental memories.</li>
      <li>This purchase was very positive.</li>
      <li>Love coming back home at the end of the   day after my place has been closed up and the fabulous scent greets me!!!</li>
      <li>It is just the right combination of both.  </li>
      <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
      <li>If there had been more than 5 stars, I would give this product (eau de parfum) the highest marks possible.  </li>
      <li>I love Shalimar, but this doesn&#x27;t smell the same as bottles I&#x27;ve purchased before.</li>
      <li>and it smells funny.  </li>
      <li>Smell is gone within the first 1/2 hour.</li>
      <li>Product exactly as described.</li>
      <li>The item arrived ahead of schedule, and was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>The produict was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Of course your own body chemistry has a lot to do with the end fragrance, but all the various notes in the parfum combine to create a very soft, alluring, and sensual aroma.  </li>
      <li>I ordered it going by the positive reviews, so maybe this was just a fluke.  </li>
      <li>However the scent certainly wasn&#x27;t that of the Shalimar that my wife and I remembered.  </li>
      <li>Very disappointing.[[ASIN:</li>
      <li>The packaging looks real, but the scent does not compare with that bought at ULTA where 1 ounce cost $72.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very disapointed.  </li>
      <li>I love the quality of the product and the fact that it has not been bought by other perfume companies nor has the formula been changed in over 50 years.</li>
      <li>Well, this is the case for me with this particular perfume.</li>
      <li>Shalimar is a classic.</li>
      <li>The scent has a classic frequency level resonating to the heavens ...  Class, elegance and mystery enveloped in vanilla.  </li>
      <li>I have worn Shalimar since I was in high school</li>
      <li>It has such an intriguing and feminine fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Not a good gift item due to the packaging, but for actual use this is one of the best values I have found.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t help but feel this product was either a knock-off, or very old.    </li>
      <li>To me, it smells so ancient that it reminds me of old rotten/moldy woods!</li>
      <li>EdC - a leathery, skin scent that&#x27;s wearable in summer, albeit a bit harsh - easily unisex&lt;br</li>
      <li>After working in the cosmetic industry for 30 years, I was a bit leary that the fragrance would be old or rancid.</li>
      <li>I think it was either old or had been stored improperly(hot/cold).  </li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s what I have been using ever since I was about 16 years old.</li>
      <li>Shalimar is the only perfume/cologne I wear, mainly because my husband loves it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Shalimar has stood the test of time, and is a proven winner.  It is a wonderful fragrance, and gets lots of compliments. It is neither too strong nor too subtle. A perfect scent for daytime or an evening out.</li>
    <li> Shalimar is awesome and an must try for anyone interested in fragrances. I have all three concentrations, which wear very differently on me and serve different purposes in my fragrance wardrobe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The EdC - a leathery, skin scent that&#x27;s wearable in summer, albeit a bit harsh - easily unisex&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The EdT - a sweet vanillic, easy-to-wear wonder, but not long-lasting - best for those who like gourmands but something easier to wear than an EdP oriental. 3-4 hours on me. Better in vintage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The EdP - an oriental vanilla with a classic progression from top to bottom, simply gorgeous, long-lasting all-day commitment.</li>
    <li> She started making hint in March with a birthday coming in April. This is her favorite perfume so I made the purchase at the end of March to make sure I had it in time. Today is April 17 with her birthday the 19th I am safe for another year.  http://www.amazon.com/Shalimar-Guerlain-Women-Parfum-Spray/dp/B000C1Z64W/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1303055040&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1</li>
    <li> A friend of mine recommended Shalimar perfume to me. She said it was so beautiful I had to try. So during my next trip to a perfume store, I asked for Shalimar. Sprayed it on paper, and then on my wrist. Both the paper and my wrist smelled so terrible to me, that I felt as if I was going to vomit. Couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and wash it off my wrist. Very old-smelling, nasty, and pungent perfume. Like some kind of old rotten wood/pines. This is not to offend anyone. I understand that every perfume smells different on different people. I also understand that what one person likes, another may not like at all. We all have our own tastes in perfumes. Well, this is the case for me with this particular perfume. To me, it smells so ancient that it reminds me of old rotten/moldy woods! Yuck!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing my Shalimar since the 60&#x27;s.  This did not disappoint.  Love coming back home at the end of the   day after my place has been closed up and the fabulous scent greets me!!!</li>
    <li> I have worn Shalimar since I was in high school and I am now retired.  It is the only perfume I have worn on which I have gotten constant compliments.  Of course your own body chemistry has a lot to do with the end fragrance, but all the various notes in the parfum combine to create a very soft, alluring, and sensual aroma.  If there had been more than 5 stars, I would give this product (eau de parfum) the highest marks possible.  It&#x27;s the perfect gift to give the woman you love, even if it&#x27;s for yourself.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only perfume I wear (for over 30 years now) and has become hard to find in stores.  Was delighted to find it at Amazon at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I have loved Shalimar since my teens and I am delighted with my purchase.  I am always finding the exact thing I want at Amazon, that I cannot seem to find reasonably at other sites.</li>
    <li> The product is what my wife wears.  The packaging looks real, but the scent does not compare with that bought at ULTA where 1 ounce cost $72.  Here was 2.5 ounces of the same prodcut for under $50.    Amazon was terrific in refunding my purchase price.  I can&#x27;t help but feel this product was either a knock-off, or very old.    In the end, you usually get what you pay for.    Kudos to Amazon for standing up for the customer.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfumefor my wife she wears one year for Christmas and she has worn no other perfune since,  she says its simply the best she has even used!</li>
    <li> It was a present for my mom that has used this product and no ther for years. So long I can&#x27;t remember her without smelling like that parfume. Great smell, I will remember it forever.</li>
    <li> Elegance in a bottle..  When this formula was first mixed almost a hundred years ago, a fragrance was created which is almost impossible to define.  The scent has a classic frequency level resonating to the heavens ...  Class, elegance and mystery enveloped in vanilla.  There is not a day that goes by when I am not asked what my wonderful fragrance is called.  Shalimar is my only perfume.  I do not feel dressed until I have sprayed on my beloved fragrance.  I prefer the EDP spray.</li>
    <li> This product can be so difficult to find.  It has such an intriguing and feminine fragrance.  It is my favorite and I was very happy to receive it promotly.</li>
    <li> I just received Shalimar I ordered.  It&#x27;s not the same perfume I used to wear in the 70&#x27;s, 80&#x27;s.  It does not smell good at all and is giving me a headache!  It smells like a mans cologn.  I&#x27;m very disapointed.  What a waist of money!!</li>
    <li> My husband got me this perfume for Mother&#x27;s Day.  I remembered that my Grandmother used this perfume when I was a child and wanted a trip back down memory lane.  I have received lots of compliments on the scent and everyone says I smell yummy!</li>
    <li> This product is not the same as I have ordered before.  The color was lighter and the smell was not the same.</li>
    <li> I am very happy. the product arrived on time and was as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this shipper to anyone.</li>
    <li> The item arrived ahead of schedule, and was exactly what I wanted.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about how pleased I am with this shopping experience!  AAA Perfume Merchants filled my order perfectly and it was received almost immediately - I will definitely use this site again and tell everyone what a great experience I had with Amazon and AAA - Thanks again!</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom for a gift. She loved it. The classics are always a good, safe bet when buying a fragrance for others.</li>
    <li> After working in the cosmetic industry for 30 years, I was a bit leary that the fragrance would be old or rancid. Amazingly it was fresh and beautiful. I am thrilled with the savings and the quality, and can say the same about all my purchases from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Not a good gift item due to the packaging, but for actual use this is one of the best values I have found.  1 spray is enough so it is lasting nearly forever!</li>
    <li> received quickly and my wife loved it</li>
    <li> I love the way this scent envelops me without being overpoweringly sweet or floral. It is just the right combination of both.  The eau de parfum is extremely hard to find in stores, at least in the part of the USA I live in. And this is a great price!!  Way to go Amazon!</li>
    <li> Shalimar is my favorite fragrance and I was delighted to find it here at such a good price.  It arrived quickly and in perfect condition...but, the fragrance was \\&quot;off\\&quot;.  I think it was either old or had been stored improperly(hot/cold).  Just not Shalimar and it smells funny.  Can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I used to buy Shalimar for my wife many years ago and thought it might be a nice idea to start the habit again. What we received came in came in a nice spray bottle just like what I ordered, Shailmar labels and all.  However the scent certainly wasn&#x27;t that of the Shalimar that my wife and I remembered.  I e-mailed Tuccini who provided it and their only reply was that they just shipped what had been provided by the manufacturer.  This is of course, believable. Still, It doesn&#x27;t have the scent that we were expecting.  I just don&#x27;t know what to do about it.  Could both our sense of smells have changed over the years?  We&#x27;re in our eighties now.  Can you help??</li>
    <li> This is a great buy.  This bottle was $60 more at the department store.  It&#x27;s the only scent I wear, so I&#x27;ll be buying more at Amazon! ljj</li>
    <li> Product exactly as described. Very fast delivery. It was a gift for my wife&#x27;s birthday and  timely delivery was very important. I am very pleased with service.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00152W1YU Shalimar By Guerlain For Women. Eau De Cologne Spray 2.5 Oz.]]  I am a lifetime user of Sharlimar Eau De Cologne Spray by Guerlain. It is a superior product and one of the things I love about this essence is that it blends with a woman&#x27;s own body chemistry to give the wearer the wonderful scent of Shalimar with one&#x27;s own unique essence. I love the quality of the product and the fact that it has not been bought by other perfume companies nor has the formula been changed in over 50 years. I am allergic to many of today&#x27;s popular fragrances but have never had a problem with Shalimar. I would recommend this beautiful scent to any woman who is looking for a perfume that is elegant, sensual and classic.  Thank you,  Marilyee Dowling</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift and it arrived in less than a week... with their standard shipping! The produict was exactly as described. Shalimar is a classic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved Shalimar since I was in college. It&#x27;s not just beautiful, but evocative of sentimental memories. If you&#x27;ve worn it yourself, ladies, you know what I&#x27;m talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are anxious to try it or use it again, get it from Amazon now. Check around at all the department stores in your area and you&#x27;ll see that this is a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free shipping makes it that much more delightful!</li>
    <li> Smells nothing like Shalimar. Smell is gone within the first 1/2 hour. I gave it away.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother. I am a bargin shopper and did a lot of research on where I could get the better bargin.  This, by far, was the BEST DEAL!!</li>
    <li> This fragrance does not smell like my Guerlain Shalimar that I have used for years. Very disappointing.[[ASIN:B000C1Z64W Shalimar By Guerlain For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 2.5 Oz.]]</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000C1Z64W Shalimar By Guerlain For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 2.5 Oz.]]   I have loved Shalimar Parfum for almost 40 years and use nothing else.  The price in the retail stores have gotten out of my range and I was toying with the idea of trying something else, but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to do it!  Then I was on Amazon.com and on a whim typed it in to search.  Amazing, the same product for about 1/2 the price!  Am so very pleased!</li>
    <li> I love Shalimar, but this doesn&#x27;t smell the same as bottles I&#x27;ve purchased before. The fragrance was very weak, to the point that I wondered if I had gotten a fake.  I will definitely go to a department store for my next purchase. I still love the fragrance, but this bottle didn&#x27;t  capture the essence of the fragrance at all.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this purchase. I have worn Shalimar perfume for more than 40 years.  The price on Amazon was the lowest I&#x27;ve paid.  Received in very good condition.  This purchase was very positive.</li>
    <li> Shalimar is the only perfume/cologne I wear, mainly because my husband loves it.  I ordered this because it was sold by Amazon and not an Amazon merchant, and it was a great price.  I opened it today and it is either fake, or a very old bottle.  It doesn&#x27;t smell at all like Shalimar. I am not worried that Amazon will refund my money, just disappointed that I have to hassle with getting a refund.  I ordered it going by the positive reviews, so maybe this was just a fluke.  Still, \\&quot;buyer beware!\\&quot;</li>

    <li> Ever since I can remember -- both my Aunts had used Shalimar.  I remember as a child that when one of them would use the perfume -- they would put a dab or two on me .... and that&#x27;s what I have been using ever since I was about 16 years old. There&#x27;s nothing like it.  LOVE IT!! P.S.  I started training my niece on Shalimar.</li>
    <li> I love Shalimar.  I always did, since I was a little girl and my mother used to put some on me before her and my father went out.  Good product.  Also cheaper and easier to find on Amazon than in most places.</li>
    <li> for the woman you love, intoxicating, seductive, rich, exquisite&lt;br /&gt;she&#x27;ll thank you for it in many ways&lt;br /&gt;i have no more to say</li>
