      <li>Satisfied customer</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I have been using for many, many years.  </li>
      <li>I am sure it has its purpose but not for my needs.</li>
      <li>I bought the stuff by the gallon, but when I finished the last bit of it, they no longer made it anymore, and this aerosol is the best I have found in today&#x27;s market.  </li>
      <li>Product came in leak proof packaging, great price, and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I love this hairspray.  </li>
      <li>Buying more than one made for free shipping.</li>
      <li>Can gets gummed up too easy.</li>
      <li>Went to the mirror turned on the lights and it looked like I had a fine mist of duct all over my hair.  </li>
      <li>I have fine wavy hair, and I wear it either spiked up, or in a pompadour-esque style.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and this does the trick.  </li>
      <li>The product is fabulous.  </li>
      <li>If anyone out there ever finds anything as good as ICE Mist of old, please let me know.</li>
      <li>I first found out about this product from my hairdresser and fell in love but did not want to pay the $18 to buy it.</li>
      <li>Ordered it and received it quickly.</li>
      <li>It also brushes out so that is super also.</li>
      <li>The ordering process was easy and the delivery was fast.</li>
      <li>Good hold hairspray, but it clogs after every single use.</li>
      <li>I love this spray holds my short fine hair</li>
      <li>It holds great without being stiff or sticky.  </li>
      <li>It is on the stiff side but looks great.</li>
      <li>Brushes right out.  </li>
      <li>It is as good as new then.&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing similar on the market that works so well.</li>
      <li>In the rare case that doesn&#x27;t work, I run hot water over it.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for a fast smooth transaction A++</li>
      <li>Love this product, used it for years, please continue to bring this to the public.</li>
      <li>Love it, the only thing that can keep my hair up!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it!!</li>
      <li>work in a meat processing facility, and your hair encounters hot humid conditions,cool moist conditions</li>
      <li>No matter what I do to it, the nozzle continues to clog, even after scraping the gunk off before spraying, you may get a straight stream right into the eyeball.  </li>
      <li>This works as well or better than any other product I&#x27;ve found available today, but still nowhere near as good as the old Joico I.C.E. Mist in a pump spray that I previously used for decades.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very sticky so if you are looking for something lighter this isn&#x27;t the hairspray for you.</li>
      <li>really holds your hair thru wind and 13 hr shifts</li>
      <li>My point is you do not need much and keep the can about 12 inches from your hair while spraying.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>Really works.</li>
      <li>I really like it because it holds better than any spray and it brushes out without leaving your hair stiff or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I normally just use the end of my comb to \\&quot;clean\\&quot; any excess spray off the nozzle before each use.  </li>
      <li>I have short, fine hair and this product holds my style all day long.  </li>
      <li>and I have to use a tweezer to get the sprayer clear.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely return to Amazon when I&#x27;m ready to purchase again.</li>
      <li>The nozzle can get clogged with spray but is easily fixed.  </li>
      <li>An additional benefit I found to using this over gel is that it dries much faster (2-5 minutes max for my short hair style).  </li>
      <li>only when I really need my hair to stay in place.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t worth taking a star away for because every similar product I&#x27;ve used did the same thing.</li>
      <li>would highly recomend it for thin or fine hair.</li>
      <li>This is the same way you clear the nozzle on a spray paint can to keep it from clogging.</li>
      <li>The product has always been consistent and works without the mess of gel.  </li>
      <li>use this product first to achieve the lift then use the Joifix Firm Finishing Spray.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years and not only has the cost steadily increased, it&#x27;s become harder to find in my local stores.</li>
      <li>awkward to use as the can is to big around, however the hold is amazing.</li>

<li> when you&#x27;re done using it, turn it completely upside down, and spray it until nothing but air comes out.</li>
<li> Only if you are on stage or need hair that must be concrete hard will this be for you.  </li>
<li> The hold lasts all day long!</li>
<li> Living in Florida where it is always humid, keeps my hair in place once I blow dry and style, never sticky.</li>
<li> One can normally lasts me a few months (a little goes a long way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It was always falling down in back.</li>
<li> I had a can almost empty that I took on a trip, in my checked bags.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t go a single day without using it!!  </li>
<li> I first got this from my hairdresser then was unable to find it any place until I checked Amazon.</li>
<li> But it holds like none other!</li>
<li> Costs less too.  </li>
<li> The last two have had serious clogging issues or seepage.</li>
<li> This will keep your hair in place where you spray it, downside is I find it to be a little crunchy.</li>
<li> My hair is very dark.  </li>
<li> The top from where the spray comes out was broken but i think it still works nothing really bad</li>
<li> Not an everyday product for me.</li>
<li> a few sprays and your hair is lifted and fluffy without any back-combing (depending on style).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <li> This works as well or better than any other product I&#x27;ve found available today, but still nowhere near as good as the old Joico I.C.E. Mist in a pump spray that I previously used for decades.  I bought the stuff by the gallon, but when I finished the last bit of it, they no longer made it anymore, and this aerosol is the best I have found in today&#x27;s market.  But still somewhat inadequate for baby-fine hair.  If anyone out there ever finds anything as good as ICE Mist of old, please let me know.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Been using it for years.</li>
    <li> This stuff will hold your hair in a tornado! The Wife says this is the best holding stuff on the market.</li>
    <li> THis is the best hairspry EVER if you wear your hair spikey,have a mototcycle or a convertible or both.It also brushes out so that is super also.I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Was so glad to find this product on Amazon at a great price. If you want your hairstyle to stay in place throughout the day, this product does the job. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and not only has the cost steadily increased, it&#x27;s become harder to find in my local stores. Buying more than one made for free shipping. Can&#x27;t beat that! I will definitely return to Amazon when I&#x27;m ready to purchase again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use it everyday....only when I really need my hair to stay in place.</li>
    <li> I have fine wavy hair, and I wear it either spiked up, or in a pompadour-esque style. I have tried literally dozens of hairsprays, and this is the ONLY one I&#x27;ve found that will keep my hair in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those complaining about the nozzle clogging: when you&#x27;re done using it, turn it completely upside down, and spray it until nothing but air comes out. This is the same way you clear the nozzle on a spray paint can to keep it from clogging.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product. The ordering process was easy and the delivery was fast. Satisfied customer</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t go a single day without using it!!  Perfect purchase and will be using them again.</li>
    <li> I first found out about this product from my hairdresser and fell in love but did not want to pay the $18 to buy it. Looked it up here and got it for half the price!!! All day hold even at work (and I work 12 hours a day) from morning to night!</li>
    <li> Liked the shine this product provided but didn&#x27;t feel it held up well in keeping the shape of my hair style...</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray.  With my style of hair, I need it, and the wind doesn&#x27;t bother it at all!</li>
    <li> I first got this from my hairdresser then was unable to find it any place until I checked Amazon. Costs less too.  It holds great without being stiff or sticky.  Brushes right out.  I have fine hair and this does the trick.  for me.  It clogs very easy so it is best to run the nozzle under warm water after use and you will have no problem.</li>
    <li> The top from where the spray comes out was broken but i think it still works nothing really bad yeah</li>
    <li> Great adhesive hairspray! I used it to tease my hair out for a Halloween costume and it worked perfectly. It&#x27;s very sticky so if you are looking for something lighter this isn&#x27;t the hairspray for you.</li>
    <li> Ordered it and received it quickly. No one in my area carries this product. So this is a great method of receiving my favorite hair spray.</li>
    <li> Mom gets her hair washed and set by her hairdresser once a week.  Blast keeps her hair in place almost the entire week.  Great stuff!  Good price, too!</li>
    <li> Blast is the best for volume and hold!!!  Last all day and doesn&#x27;t have a build up.  Highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Actually holds hair in place!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving it three stars because the nozzle clogs repeatedly. This is the 3rd can I&#x27;ve had. The last two have had serious clogging issues or seepage. No matter what I do to it, the nozzle continues to clog, even after scraping the gunk off before spraying, you may get a straight stream right into the eyeball.  This also causes the spray,  at times, to seep out of the can and onto the counter. I assume it&#x27;s a design flaw. The product itself, however, is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I really love this hairspray!  The only two things that could make me happier would be to find it in a travel size and to not use the word adhesive on the label.  I had a can almost empty that I took on a trip, in my checked bags.  It was removed.  A month later I received a letter from TSA that they had removed it...aerosolized adhesive spray is not allowed.</li>
    <li> Good price and i will order more.</li>
    <li> This will keep your hair in place where you spray it, downside is I find it to be a little crunchy. Not an everyday product for me.</li>
    <li> I have used &amp;#34;Blast&amp;#34; for years.  It definitely helps to hold the hair where I want it in this awful Texas humidity!  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Been using Joico Ice Blast Spray for a few years now.  Every time I&#x27;d try a different product, I found myself comparing it to this.  The product has always been consistent and works without the mess of gel.  An additional benefit I found to using this over gel is that it dries much faster (2-5 minutes max for my short hair style).  One can normally lasts me a few months (a little goes a long way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had one complaint about the product it would be this.  The nozzle can get clogged with spray but is easily fixed.  I normally just use the end of my comb to \\&quot;clean\\&quot; any excess spray off the nozzle before each use.  In the rare case that doesn&#x27;t work, I run hot water over it.  This isn&#x27;t worth taking a star away for because every similar product I&#x27;ve used did the same thing.</li>
    <li> The product is fabulous.  Getting it out of the container is lousy.  Gums up every time and I have to use a tweezer to get the sprayer clear.  But it holds like none other!</li>
    <li> I really like it because it holds better than any spray and it brushes out without leaving your hair stiff or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recomend it for thin or fine hair.</li>
    <li> This is a very good spray. It holds any style till you brush it out. It is on the stiff side but looks great.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST spray I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s worked well for my up do&#x27;s, and for my stacked bob when it was short. It holds your hair where you want it. You can be conservative or crazy funky, whatever you feel like that day. Product came in leak proof packaging, great price, and fast shipping. Pleased!</li>
    <li> Great product, as always.</li>
    <li> Only if you are on stage or need hair that must be concrete hard will this be for you.  My daughter is in stage performances and it is perfect.  It is difficult to wash out.  I am sure it has its purpose but not for my needs.</li>
    <li> I have short, fine hair and this product holds my style all day long.  Only product I use to finish my hair.</li>
    <li> The blast hair spray is a blast. Your hair stays in place,believe me a blast of wind will not ruffle your hair!</li>
    <li> really holds your hair thru wind and 13 hr shifts</li>
    <li> Love it........have used for 10 years</li>
    <li> Good hold hairspray, but it clogs after every single use. Also the can is very awkward to hold onto and spray.</li>
    <li> This hair spray is really awesome!! Need to be in every Beauty supply store...</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I have been using for many, many years.  After your hair is styled,&lt;br /&gt;just a few sprays and your hair is lifted and fluffy without any back-combing (depending on style).&lt;br /&gt;I use this product first to achieve the lift then use the Joifix Firm Finishing Spray.  Your style will hold for over&lt;br /&gt;14 hours !!!&lt;br /&gt;I work in a meat processing facility, and your hair encounters hot humid conditions,cool moist conditions&lt;br /&gt;and also in a freezer.  My hair holds up all day and I can go out after work without having to re-do my hair for&lt;br /&gt;the evening !</li>
    <li> I love ths spray. The hold lasts all day long!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for about 5 years. I wear my hair backcombed in the back and sides.  It was always falling down in back. After using this hair spray nothing moves my hair.  It is like liquid cement but after you spray it on you can still comb through it.  My hair is very dark.  Used it too heavily once.  Did not notice anything when I sprayed it on.  WHen I got home that day my roommate asked me what is that dust doing all over your hair?  Went to the mirror turned on the lights and it looked like I had a fine mist of duct all over my hair.  My point is you do not need much and keep the can about 12 inches from your hair while spraying.&lt;br /&gt;Also everytime I use it the nozzle gets clogged up so I just put it under the faucet and brush the nozzle.  It is as good as new then.&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing similar on the market that works so well.</li>
    <li> Love it, the only thing that can keep my hair up! Really works.</li>
    <li> awkward to use as the can is to big around, however the hold is amazing. It&#x27;s very hard to get the product out of hair in the shower.  I probalbly won&#x27;t buy it again unless the can is made smaller.</li>
    <li> Can gets gummed up too easy.</li>
    <li> Thanks for a fast smooth transaction A++</li>
    <li> Great  product by Joico, works great for all hairstyles and does not flake or make your hair all crunchy or siff</li>
    <li> I WAS INTRODUCED TO THIS PRODUCT SEVERAL YEARS AGO IN fLORIDA AND HAVE USED IT EVER SINCE. iT KEEPS MY HAIR IN PLACE FOR ALMOST A WEEK AFTER IT IS DONE AT THE BEAUTY PARLOR.  I  WOULD RECOMMEND IT.&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE YO PURCHASE IT MYSELF AS THE SALON DOES NOT CARRY IT. I COULD NOT FIND THIS PRODUCT LOCALLY AND HEARD AMAZON CARRIED IT.</li>
    <li> Best hairspray for dance competition hair dos.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Living in Florida where it is always humid, keeps my hair in place once I blow dry and style, never sticky.</li>
    <li> Love this product, used it for years, please continue to bring this to the public.</li>
    <li> I love this spray holds my short fine hair all day Would not use anything else on my hair. Works on humid days too!</li>
