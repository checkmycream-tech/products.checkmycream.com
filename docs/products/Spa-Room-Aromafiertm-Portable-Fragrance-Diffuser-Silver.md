      <li>Works perfect.</li>
      <li>I happen to have a USB port on a desk lamp that works great with this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for FL.</li>
      <li>wonderful portable for you favorite oils</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s seriously as bright as a flashlight and can&#x27;t be turned off.</li>
      <li>The button has a  too bright bulb which disturbs ability to fall asleep.</li>
      <li>This worked really good, I may buy another one.</li>
      <li>Cord is good sized too</li>
      <li>Works great and smells up more than just the bedroom I have it plugged in at.</li>
      <li>This product is the niftiest item to fill a room  with nice scents.</li>
      <li>Works well, but when turned on, the light is so bright it keeps me from sleeping.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s great that it doesn&#x27;t need batteries cuz cars heat up too hot.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind refreshing oil drops.</li>
      <li>The Spa Room Aromafier made our trip to Ireland even more enjoyable.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;So may have to purchase more</li>
      <li>This is perfect for my husband and I to use in the car on our long road trips, we love to diffuse stress relief oils for traffic and stay alert for those drowsy drives.</li>
      <li>Sweet!</li>
      <li>A great many are, especially at the lower price scale.</li>
      <li>if you want a fulsome benefit of oil properties (like the unique santalols from sandalwood or the healing benefits from choya loban), but pretty bang-on for giving wonderful, natural scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a USB to DC Pin Jack, or can run off batteries, but you will need to supply a USB AC Adaptor if you want to plug it in.</li>
      <li>[[VIDEOID:4b7945098ae4b0c47bdf95cd16a6916c]]Very simple concept, but very effective.</li>
      <li>Otherwise you will have to wash the original pad each time you change fragrances.</li>
      <li>Love it and very convenient.</li>
      <li>It plugs right into USB.</li>
      <li>A family member is planning a long trip in a new RV, and this thing will be awesome for that, which happens to be the reason why she bought two of them during a local sale...</li>
      <li>so you can set it in various places if u want. :-)</li>
      <li>I read through sop many discriptions that simply missed that/</li>
      <li>but I strongly advise purchasing extra pads so that you can change scents.</li>
      <li>Use it in the bathroom in a preschool  setting it very relaxing</li>
      <li>Combined with its stable profile, super quiet operation, sleek look, this thing really is a traveler&#x27;s choice.</li>
      <li>this is great for small spaces, but in an average sized living room it gets lost.</li>
      <li>I have mine in the bedroom and another near the front door.</li>
      <li>A lot cheaper than how fast air freshness dry out in FL.</li>
      <li>Still kept it, as it&#x27;s not bad, but I hopes to get a small two in one thingy not take  a lot of space on my office table.</li>
      <li>Its too small to be useful.</li>

<li> I stopped using it after a few days because I couldn&#x27;t even smell the lavender.  </li>
<li> small fan runs inside, drops of oil on a pad waft up, and the grill in front funnels it out.</li>
<li> Was skeptical b/c assumed it heated.</li>
<li> It goes through batteries like crazy.</li>
<li> my bad</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought 3 of these and bought the essential oils&lt;br /&gt;Gave 2 away&lt;br /&gt;So may have to purchase more</li>
    <li> Its too small to be useful. The button has a  too bright bulb which disturbs ability to fall asleep. I stopped using it after a few days because I couldn&#x27;t even smell the lavender.  Easier to put drops of oil on your pillow case.</li>
    <li> Use it in the bathroom in a preschool  setting it very relaxing feeling  all day for me</li>
    <li> The Spa Room Aromafier made our trip to Ireland even more enjoyable.  Sweet!</li>
    <li> Works well, but when turned on, the light is so bright it keeps me from sleeping. It&#x27;s seriously as bright as a flashlight and can&#x27;t be turned off.</li>
    <li> Luv this. Was skeptical b/c assumed it heated. It doesn&#x27;t. It has a fan in it. It&#x27;s great for FL. I don&#x27;t mind refreshing oil drops. A lot cheaper than how fast air freshness dry out in FL. And it&#x27;s great that it doesn&#x27;t need batteries cuz cars heat up too hot. It plugs right into USB. Cord is good sized too so you can set it in various places if u want. :-)</li>
    <li> wonderful portable for you favorite oils</li>
    <li> Wish it came with an electric cord.  It goes through batteries like crazy.</li>
    <li> I guess it&#x27;[s my bad that I didn&#x27;t realize this small thing is not a humidifier + diffuser but only infuser. I read through sop many discriptions that simply missed that/ Still kept it, as it&#x27;s not bad, but I hopes to get a small two in one thingy not take  a lot of space on my office table.</li>
    <li> This product is the niftiest item to fill a room  with nice scents. I have mine in the bedroom and another near the front door. The aromafier comes with one pad for essential oils but I strongly advise purchasing extra pads so that you can change scents. Otherwise you will have to wash the original pad each time you change fragrances. With one set of batteries, this product uses batteries, runs many hours and is small enough sit on a shelf or a small table.</li>
    <li> Could not get it to work.&lt;br /&gt;Charged it as instructed and it registered as fully charged but it never did anything.&lt;br /&gt;Piece of junk!!!&lt;br /&gt;Should not even get one star.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for my husband and I to use in the car on our long road trips, we love to diffuse stress relief oils for traffic and stay alert for those drowsy drives. Works perfect.</li>
    <li> Small, portable, convenient and quiet. Works great and smells up more than just the bedroom I have it plugged in at.</li>
    <li> This worked really good, I may buy another one.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:4b7945098ae4b0c47bdf95cd16a6916c]]Very simple concept, but very effective. The number one thing you probably need to consider is the question: Is your \\&quot;essential\\&quot; oil cut with a carrier oil like jojoba oil? A great many are, especially at the lower price scale. This will have a drastic impact in results with any aromatherapy device, especially one that uses a basic concept like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small fan runs inside, drops of oil on a pad waft up, and the grill in front funnels it out. That&#x27;s it. No agitation, no heat, just air current. Not really the method to use if you want a fulsome benefit of oil properties (like the unique santalols from sandalwood or the healing benefits from choya loban), but pretty bang-on for giving wonderful, natural scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a USB to DC Pin Jack, or can run off batteries, but you will need to supply a USB AC Adaptor if you want to plug it in. I happen to have a USB port on a desk lamp that works great with this. I ran a USB power meter through, and this draws a tiny, tiny, TINY 0.02 amps... so you can even power it via a portable pocket battery for ages. Combined with its stable profile, super quiet operation, sleek look, this thing really is a traveler&#x27;s choice. A family member is planning a long trip in a new RV, and this thing will be awesome for that, which happens to be the reason why she bought two of them during a local sale... and yes, I absconded with one after my initial testing- heh.</li>
    <li> this is great for small spaces, but in an average sized living room it gets lost. best for a bedroom or office.</li>
    <li> Love it and very convenient.</li>
    <li> Works great! Very quiet!</li>
    <li> Compact power buster. It is made for smaller room and individual use.</li>
