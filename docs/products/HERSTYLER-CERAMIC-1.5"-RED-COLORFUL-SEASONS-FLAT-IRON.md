    <li> This straightener is fabulous. I have purchased seven of these straighteners in the past two years - I refer it to EVERYONE or give it as gifts.    I am so thankful I can find it for a decent price. I feel terrible for those who have paid $200.00 at the mall...My hair feels wonderful and looks wonderful when I use it - I will NEVER use another straightener again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  DOES WHAT IT SAYS.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.  This is an awesome ceramic straightener that keeps hair healthy.  Has temperature control dial as well.</li>
    <li> Love it rather spend $30 than $200</li>
    <li> This is the #1 best straightener there is out there! I remember buying this like 5 years ago at a kiosk in the mall for $100! So I was pleasantly surprised when I found this for $20. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! This is my second straightener from this company and it is just the best purchase and investment you could make if you really love your hair. This is my 2 flat iron. My first one still works fantastic, and I keep still use that. I just keep that one at my boyfriends house. I I have this straightener at my house, and I just can&#x27;t get over how amazing it works. I take very good care of my flat irons, because hair products are very expensive, and I appreciate what I have. This product just works great. It heats up in 3 seconds (no joke). It gets so hot, I feel like I could bake cookies on it. The shipping took, I believe 3 days not long at all. The color is exactly what it is on the image. I just love it. If you love your hair, and you take good care of it, you will appreciate the works of a Herstyler Flat iron. It works every time. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Just like the $129 one that I bought from the mall several years ago.  LOVE my herstyler so much better than my chi leaves hair silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this Flat Iron.  I had purchase one over seven years ago and I back again.  Greatest for natural hair!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s  good i guess, but i knew it wasnt the original when i first touched it because it was light..and it didn&#x27;t come with the storage pouch...I bought one for 180 in the mall and is super heavy and worked great..the plates on this are thin. .but it heats up..</li>
    <li> My hair is extremely thick and this flat iron makes my hair silky soft when i&#x27;m done with it. I it gives me flawless curls.</li>
    <li> i love this flatiron. It does give me a lot of split ends if i use it a lot. I have really curly frizzy hair. Whenever i use this flatiron i have no frizz and my hair stays straight.</li>
    <li> Great price my wife love it works just fine</li>
    <li> I expected a much better product. I heard this straightener is really good, but honestly my Walmart hair straightener is way better. This straightener squeaks and pulls my hair. I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have had my fair share of flat irons and this one is by far my favorite! I hate how much a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; flat iron can cost you and half the time it breaks within the first year or it doesn&#x27;t do the job. This one does the job at half the cost! My sister has had hers for over 3 years and it still is going strong. It leaves my hair straight and it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair which is a plus! Everyone should own one of these!!</li>
    <li> Love it! Delivered before the delivery date. Very happy</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my best friend as a graduation gift she absolutely loved it.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I came across it God knows how many years ago. My mom got hers at the mall so long ago at least 6 years or so and it&#x27;s still hanging in there. She paid the full $150 or so it is there. I was not going to do that, I was ecstatic to see it was on here for $130 less then the mall and I had to get it. I have thick curly hair and it does wonders on my mane. It keeps my hair soft and shiny.</li>
