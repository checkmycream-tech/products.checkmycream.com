### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>sometimes it&#x27;s best to review all of the reviews of a product before making a somewhat informed decision to purchase it (of course results may vary).</li>
      <li>It works perfectly.</li>
      <li>EVERYTHING WENT PERFECT.</li>
      <li>It works great.</li>
      <li>They work wonderfully and were easy to install.  </li>
      <li>Perfect replacement and hastle free transaction.</li>
      <li>who said you can&#x27;t good things at a bargain price.</li>
      <li>These replacement blades were exactly as described and worked perfectly.</li>
      <li>I have found that the Flex360 gives me a close uniform shave which is the equal of the best that I have had.</li>
      <li>It feels great to shave with new cutters.</li>
      <li>I use to be able to order the Rotory cutters and place them in my R7132 Reminton&#x27;s original notched head.</li>
      <li>But, working fine after installation.</li>
      <li>There is also a charging stand available for $10.</li>
      <li>Does not match the original, dual-track quality of the original heads on my razor.  </li>
      <li>It doesn’t pop-open like the original head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Would have liked being able to buy just the cutters, rather than the entire head.</li>
      <li>Just clean the blades</li>
      <li>This is actually good enough to trim hair in lieu of haircut..</li>
      <li>However, the true test of a razor is how well</li>
      <li>Contacted the seller who quickly refunded my money including shipping --</li>
      <li>These replacement heads were an exact fit for my razor.  </li>
      <li>Replaced the entire head, very easy</li>
      <li>The blades fit in the old heads fine, but when I did a test run on my 2 day old weekend fuzz, I noticed that the hair was not being cut or removed.</li>
      <li>This is the razor that allows each individual shaver head to twist-open from the top, to remove the cutter blades for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks Markdown Mania, will be buying from you again!</li>
      <li>Remington&#x27;s replacement cutter head assembly will not accommodate the original clear plastic protective blade head assembly because they lack the notches.</li>
      <li>The head closes fine, but when you push the front release button, the head seems to be stuck and needs some force to open.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I took out the old blades and put the new one&#x27;s in to cut the right side and guess what, nothing happen.</li>
      <li>New heads make all the difference!</li>
      <li>I was happily surprised at the whole operation.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like my razor is new.</li>
      <li>My original head was all-black, but this new head is chrome (silver) on the top-half with black on the 3 rotary head retaining rings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>* Does not come with a clear plastic cover for the head and the R-4130 cover does not fit.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now I have to order the whole assembly that doesn&#x27;t have notches that allow you to attach the clear plastic protective blade cover, so I have a stockpile of empty head housing.</li>
      <li>So again I tinkered and put in the old blades and cut the left side of my face, voila</li>
      <li>So, I can get to work a few minutes earlier, or maybe better, sleep a few minutes</li>

<li> There is really not much more to say than I will buy again when needed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Perfect replacement and hastle free transaction.</li>
    <li> Dont buy from these people they will not send your productand they will not get back with you when u try to contact them but they will charge u for it now  i have to file a claim with amazon still waiting</li>
    <li> I ordered the Flex 360 replacement for a R3130 razor and the blades will not snap into place. When I ordered the replacement head it listed it as a replacement for the R3130 but the R3130 isn&#x27;t listed  on the package I received.</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery, and the mechanics to install the replacement heads took literally  seconds.  I was happily surprised at the whole operation.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> wrong item for my razor</li>
    <li> It works great. It is manages to tame the forest that is my facial hair. Just clean the blades and they will last you a long while.</li>
    <li> who said you can&#x27;t good things at a bargain price.This is actually good enough to trim hair in lieu of haircut..Price is a steal.</li>
    <li> The Remington Flex360 family of electric razors includes the R-4130, R-5130, and the R-7130. The high-end R-7130 sells for around $80 on Amazon, the R-5130 for $55, while the low-end model, R-4130, goes for $44 on Amazon. The difference among the models is the charging system. There is also a charging stand available for $10. These are all competitive prices. However, the true test of a razor is how well it shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, I have used electric razors manufactured by Remington, Braun, and Norelco. I have found that the Flex360 gives me a close uniform shave which is the equal of the best that I have had. It also does this in about three minutes, half the time of that of my previous razor, a rotary of Norelco of similar design. So, I can get to work a few minutes earlier, or maybe better, sleep a few minutes later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The total cost over the life of an electric razor must include that of replacement cutting heads. The SP-5161 head for the R-5130 and the R-7130 sells for $27 on Amazon, while the [[ASIN:B001EJMS9W SP-3141 head for the R-4130 is as little as $22]]. These are equal to or lower than the prices of replacement heads for other razors. The instruction booklet suggests replacing the heads every twelve months. That sounds optimistic since I have had to buy replacement heads for other razors after around six months. However, I have used the Remington shaver for over one year before having to replace the cutting heads.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s another example of sometimes it&#x27;s best to review all of the reviews of a product before making a somewhat informed decision to purchase it (of course results may vary). I also have a R3130 model and it was listed on the SP-3141 that this product was a replacement for the R3130 model. However upon installing the blades and heads, I noticed that the heads would not set into the notched grooved as my previous heads did. So being the tinker that I am, I decided to just replace the blades. The blades fit in the old heads fine, but when I did a test run on my 2 day old weekend fuzz, I noticed that the hair was not being cut or removed. So again I tinkered and put in the old blades and cut the left side of my face, voila, they still cut. I took out the old blades and put the new one&#x27;s in to cut the right side and guess what, nothing happen. So the moral of this story is this product does not work with the R3130 model as the other reviewers with the same model as mine have stated.</li>
    <li> Does not match the original, dual-track quality of the original heads on my razor.  Single-track heads at dual-track price - BEWARE.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads were an exact fit for my razor.  They work wonderfully and were easy to install.  It&#x27;s like my razor is new.</li>
    <li> It would not fit my R4150 Remington Razor. Offered my head so vender could install but he refused.</li>
    <li> The sealed package indicated it fits series 4100 and 5100 Remington razors. This is a mistake, the pieces will not fit at all. Spoke w/Remington, they said it was indeed a mistake in packaging. Contacted the seller who quickly refunded my money including shipping -- Thanks Markdown Mania, will be buying from you again!</li>
    <li> Sent it back did not work on my razor.  No problem getting credit for returned item.</li>
    <li> Replaced the entire head, very easy</li>
    <li> I use to be able to order the Rotory cutters and place them in my R7132 Reminton&#x27;s original notched head. Now I have to order the whole assembly that doesn&#x27;t have notches that allow you to attach the clear plastic protective blade cover, so I have a stockpile of empty head housing. Why can&#x27;t we the consumer order just the cutters alone ? Remington&#x27;s replacement cutter head assembly will not accommodate the original clear plastic protective blade head assembly because they lack the notches.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product, Remington SP-3141 Replacement Rotary Heads and Cutters (orange packaging), for my R-4130 razor.  This is the razor that allows each individual shaver head to twist-open from the top, to remove the cutter blades for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product I received was, Remington SPR Replacement Shaver Head (black packaging)…  [[ASIN:B003S6CVIC Remington SPRCDN Universal Rotary Replacement Shaver Head, Black]]  This is an entire head assembly and the 3 individual heads are not removable, but you can remove the cutter blades from the inside (with the head open).  My original head was all-black, but this new head is chrome (silver) on the top-half with black on the 3 rotary head retaining rings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller and they discovered that Remington has stopped making the SP-3141 and the SPR head is currently the only option they offer.  The SPR packaging says it works with the R3, R4, R5, R6, R7 and R8 series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO (SPR):&lt;br /&gt;* Each cutter has 2 rings of blades instead of one for a quicker shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON (SPR):&lt;br /&gt;* Does not come with a clear plastic cover for the head and the R-4130 cover does not fit.&lt;br /&gt;* The head closes fine, but when you push the front release button, the head seems to be stuck and needs some force to open.  It doesn’t pop-open like the original head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See attached 4 photos for details of the Remington SPR shaver head.</li>
    <li> These replacement blades were exactly as described and worked perfectly. There is really not much more to say than I will buy again when needed.</li>
    <li> EVERYTHING WENT PERFECT.</li>
    <li> Would have liked being able to buy just the cutters, rather than the entire head. But, working fine after installation.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly. It feels great to shave with new cutters. The only problem is the shaver opening mechanism. For some reason with this new head it would be more difficult to open it for cleaning, but is not that bad.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the other replacement titanium set with the groove on the heads.</li>
    <li> New heads make all the difference!</li>
