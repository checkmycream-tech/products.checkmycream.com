      <li>2 pumps seems to be perfect and mine has not run out yet, which I found a lot of people were writing in their reviews.</li>
      <li>This lotion is incredible!</li>

      <li>This product has greatly improved my skin&#x27;s texture.</li>
      <li>This moisturizer was great.</li>

      <li>and I had just been to see my dermatologist who approved it as a good one to use.</li>
      <li>Loved that it had SPF an retinol as well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good habit that I should have started 10 years ago.</li>
      <li>so you will need to interchange with a good moisturizer and use a scrub like St.</li>
      <li>As to the effectiveness: As a sun protection agent this product is good.  </li>
      <li>I have always had good results with this product until I ordered it from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I loved the sunscreen and it kept my oily skin from looking too shiny.    </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t do any harm, but didn&#x27;t do any good.  </li>
      <li>In this case, it&#x27;s a good thing   </li>
      <li>Good but smells like vitamins.</li>
      <li>I will continue using the Neutrogena Ageless Intensive Tone Correcting Moisture though because like I said, it&#x27;s a good moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I have fair skin and have never tried to be tan.</li>
      <li>Good product, easy to apply and very good sun protection.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a great, non-greasy moisturiser, and my skin has never felt better.  </li>
      <li>I rarely write reviews for products, but I am so impressed by this one&#x27;s effectiveness, I just had to chime in.</li>
      <li>Now I just need to find a product to make the huge pores on my nose look invisible!!  </li>
      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer!  </li>

      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>This product goes on nice and isn&#x27;t greasy or shiny.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice lotion for day wear</li>
      <li>First, any anti-aging product is as good as the amount of sunscreen or protection you add to it!</li>
      <li>Plus it gives a nice healthy glow without being too oily.</li>
      <li>This is by far one of the best!</li>
      <li>And this has it - not SPF 5 or 15 but a very adequate SPF 30!</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Makeup applies very nicely on top</li>
      <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
      <li>I react poorly to many facial products and this just feels wonderful.</li>
      <li>I have noticed it helps my complexion a bit, but I still do have many age spots (which I&#x27;m assuming a dermatologist would have to get me perscription stuff).    </li>
      <li>Anyways, I love how it&#x27;s got</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s also SPF 30.</li>
      <li>Clinique makes a better color correcting CC type cream.</li>
      <li>Now that I&#x27;m getting close to 50, I&#x27;ve noticed that I could take better care of my skin</li>
      <li>As a matter of fact, my skin is in better condition than before.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing but sorta melts into the skin nice and smoothly.  </li>
      <li>I stopped using it and cannot give any more details than that.</li>
      <li>I bought this two days ago and my skin looks better already.</li>
      <li>okay, I can&#x27;t stand it anymore.  </li>
      <li>I thought this would be okay</li>
      <li>everything&#x27;s better now.  </li>
      <li>actually product is not just &#x27;okay&#x27; - it&#x27;s the best!</li>
      <li>, I just add a matt finish (DHC velvet skin coat) on top of the tone correcting lotion.</li>
      <li>used it for several years and does an excellent job of sun protection and skin correction.  </li>
      <li>After almost 2 weeks, most of my acne scars have all but disappeared.</li>
      <li>Love the finish.</li>
      <li>Do I need to say more about the locking mechanism?</li>
      <li>My skin feel better, brighter</li>
      <li>but I bought for its safe ingredients and SPF.</li>
      <li>After a week or two of pumps, you can&#x27;t pump any more product out despite the fact that there&#x27;s still more in the bottle.</li>
      <li>, it looks healthy.</li>
      <li>I fell in love with this product because it makes my skin GLOW.</li>
      <li>I love it because it isn&#x27;t greasy, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, has an spf included, and I feel like it gives my skin a refreshed look after I apply it.  </li>
      <li>Brightens skin and makes your skin look more radiant.</li>
      <li>the packaging was great and fast also</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Thank you, I love this</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>It goes on very light, gives good coverage and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like many higher spf creams.</li>
      <li>This easy to use product seems to work about as well as a prescription product which is more drying to the skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> One of the best moisturizers I have ever used. Contains spf 30. Brightens skin and makes your skin look more radiant. Over time and after each use. Contains soy. Very beneficial to skin. Wish they sold a bigger size. Its 1oz for 18.99 usually.</li>
    <li> Used it all up and really didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in skin tone. Like spf 30 and pump. Decided to refill pump with other products and can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d recommend this product. Maybe if I used for longer, but it seemed I went through this bottle pretty fast.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. My skin is softer, smoother. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> Although this has sunscreen in it, I&#x27;ve been using it at night. I&#x27;ve been told you should use a good moisturizer with retinol at night when your body is actively repairing itself. I&#x27;ve been using this for only four days and the results are unbelievable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fair, sensitive skin with large pores and a lot of redness, especially on my nose. I also have a lot of sun spots, especially near the corners of my eyes and above my upper lip. I think those will be the toughest fix, and I&#x27;ve seen only a slight improvement in them (like I say, it&#x27;s only been 4 days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I was in such a rush to write this review is because the redness and large pores have been reduced SIGNIFICANTLY - something I never expected and had just learned to live with. My skin is also much smoother looking and feeling, with a noticeable improvement in fine lines already. My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years! Did I mention it&#x27;s been 4 days?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (11/5/11): When this bottle was gone, I tried RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream based on the glowing reviews. I was not impressed and have since gone back to this product.</li>
    <li> I did not purchase the product from Amazon and not one to usually take the time to write reviews but I made a decision to do that for this product. I&#x27;m 26 years old with medium skin.  First, any anti-aging product is as good as the amount of sunscreen or protection you add to it! And this has it - not SPF 5 or 15 but a very adequate SPF 30! That gives me peace of mind that my skin is being protected when I go out!  Second - it has retinol - a proven, potent, anti-aging ingredient! I was waiting for the redness and peeling and stinging sensation related to use of retinol from other reviews but 8 days in, and applying twice daily - there is no reaction whatsoever! No redness, peeling, stinging sensation. I&#x27;m pleased.  Third, it has VISIBLY reduced my sun spots and discoloration on my face. The only dark area are my eye circles - but this has brightened and continues to even out my skin tone. I did want to give my usually made-up and congested face a rest once in a while but since using this product - I have skipped my makeup regimen altogether unless I have a formal function to attend.  Fourth, it&#x27;s not oily and very moisturizing. When I do wear makeup, it glides on smoothly.  And, I would have to disagree with reviews that complain about the small size. Its travel size fits perfectly in my handbag which means I can take it everywhere and reapply as needed (which you need to do to make sure you are continuously protected!) Do I need to say more about the locking mechanism? I don&#x27;t need to worry about this spilling allover and creating a mess.  It&#x27;s a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Totally evens out my skin tone and nothing I have tried has EVER done that before. The tinted kind doesn&#x27;t work as well and is very orange. The nontinted is excellent. I noticed a weird spot on my cheek the other day and I was like \\&quot;what the heck is that?\\&quot; It was a lightened birthmark! I wasn&#x27;t trying to lighten it and was shocked to see that it was so faint (normally it is a very large dark brown spot). The spot that I am trying to lighten didn&#x27;t lighten as much, but that is ok because this product still made a huge change in my complexion in just a few days. I wish that it was easier to get the bottom scrids out when it is almost empty. Oh, and my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t like the scent but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> This product actually does even skin tone with an SPF 30 at a decent price. The only con is that it is a very small  container. I have used a lot of Neutrogena products and for the face this is probably the best.</li>
    <li> PROS: This moisturizer is light and really seemed to make my skin feel and look smoother. I loved the sunscreen and it kept my oily skin from looking too shiny.    CONS: The packaging is TERRIBLE. After a week or two of pumps, you can&#x27;t pump any more product out despite the fact that there&#x27;s still more in the bottle. Turning the bottle upside down doesn&#x27;t do any good as the opening is so narrow. I finally decided that this wasn&#x27;t a very cost-effective product for me and stopped using it.</li>
    <li> I just love it and the price was unbelievable.</li>
    <li> This is a nice moisturizer, but the package is terrible. After about one week of use you can&#x27;t get anything out.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I have been using it for 2 years and I recommend to everyone. The texture and spots improved within 2 months. The Retinol in it helps in achieving that. I use throughout the year, sometimes supplementing it with another Neutrogena Ageless Intensives products during winter.</li>
    <li> Once again tried another product after reading a personal review.  However, this product is great: not greasy, goes on easily, absored instantly.  I have oily skin and usually need to mix water with this type of product.  But not this one.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of Neutrogena products, but this is by far my FAVORITE! I have very sensitive, oily skin with large pores, and this does not irritate me. I noticed an improvement in my skin almost over night! My skin is also prone to pimples with produts that are too heavy, but NO problem with this one. I love to try different/new facial care produts, and I have not been able to bring myself to switch from this moisturizer. Have I mentioned that I get complemented on my skin FREQUENTLY?!?! This moisturizer is worth EVERY cent! The only change I would make to this product is for it to come in larger bottles!</li>
    <li> This product worked great on me. I had uneven skin tone due to Sun burns and this product showed good results in 1-2 months.</li>
    <li> I sometimes use this under the Neutrogena day time wrinkle moisturizer. Read my review for that item.&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena is compatible with my skin.</li>
    <li> Perhaps this product works for some, but it did nothing for me.  I&#x27;ve used it as directed for over one month.  It didn&#x27;t do any harm, but didn&#x27;t do any good.  And, it is not a great moisturizer for my skin.  So, I&#x27;d recommend using other products.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  It goes on pretty lightweight but I can tell it is moisturizing without it getting greasy. I have noticed it helps my complexion a bit, but I still do have many age spots (which I&#x27;m assuming a dermatologist would have to get me perscription stuff).    Anyways, I love how it&#x27;s got SPF 30 and that it&#x27;s not a problem with my oily face and dry cheeks.</li>
    <li> Good but smells like vitamins.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;ve used other Neutrogena face cleansers in the past, that&#x27;s about all I&#x27;ve ever really done is wash my face.  I never moisturized, used toner, exfoliated, etc.  Now that I&#x27;m getting close to 50, I&#x27;ve noticed that I could take better care of my skin so I&#x27;m trying out the Ageless Intensives Tone Correcting lotion.  In my opinion, the lotion goes on greasy feeling and continues to feel greasy during the day.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s been absorbed but sitting on the top of my face.  Is that what a moisturizer&#x27;s suppose to do?  While it hasn&#x27;t done anything awful to my skin, I&#x27;ll probably try something else after I use up this up.  In this case, it&#x27;s a good thing   it&#x27;s such a small bottle.  Update 10/29/2010 - okay, I can&#x27;t stand it anymore.  I used this for a couple of weeks and then my face started breaking out big time.  Huge acne issue.  I switched to the Neutrogena combination face lotion and everything&#x27;s better now.  The regular line of Neutrogena face lotion is much better.  Not oil/greasy and is absorbed to hydrate face.</li>
    <li> Love this product really clears my dark spots</li>
    <li> My favorite moisturizer hands down!</li>
    <li> I like that this product is not greasy and actually helps my face maintain a non oily appearance for several hours.  It works well with b/peroxide and can be used both morning and night (though I feel the SPF is wasted at night).</li>
    <li> Caused my face to breakout.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I went in search of a lotion that would even out my skin tone and not feel greasy or break me out - I have fair, sensitive skin.  It has only been 5 days and I see such an improvement in my skin.  Like another reviewer stated, my skin is glowing.  I wish the bottle was bigger, but that&#x27;s not a huge problem ... I will just buy 2 bottles at a time.  One for home and one for my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try this to even out your skin tone.  I saw results the very next day.  I use it in the morning under my make-up and at night after I remove my make-up.  Now I just need to find a product to make the huge pores on my nose look invisible!!  Any suggestions??</li>
    <li> I had to stop using this product because it stung my face so badly.  It had a very good scent but was far too strong for my not very delicate skin.</li>
    <li> Good product, easy to apply and very good sun protection.  YES !!!</li>
    <li> Love this product it works excellent also the packaging was great and fast also</li>
    <li> I would have loved this Neutrogena moisturizer when I was a decade or two younger, but alas, I am not.  In my 30&#x27;s, as my skin turned towards combination skin and I started to use mositurizers this would have been perfect!  I would have been quite happy with the results into my early forties, but now that the 50s are here, this doesn&#x27;t quite have enough moisturizer capabilities to work for me now.  But if you aren&#x27;t as old and decrepit as me, this will probably be a fabulous product for you!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It absorbs well and keeps me protected from the sun.  Powder and makeup also go well over it.  I use it on my face, neck, and chest.  I apply other stuff for my arms and hands because I need to reapply there more but this is great!  It seems pricey but as a white girl living in southern CA, I need to do whatever I can to stay unwrinkly.  This stuff helps me.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of facial products, some costing as much as $180. I fell in love with this product because it makes my skin GLOW. It is not heavy and I can wear it all year long. I don&#x27;t have problem skin. I have combination skin that consists of an oily T-zone and dry cheeks. This product has greatly improved my skin&#x27;s texture. The price is great as well.</li>
    <li> Drys out your skin! I have sensitive skin. I thought this would be okay but within a day of using it my skin was patchy and flaking off especially around the eye area. I stopped using it and cannot give any more details than that.</li>
    <li> It may work for some folks but it did nothing for me. Did nothing to correct my skin tone which is not that bad. Maybe if you are 20 it works</li>
    <li> This is affordable and needs to be available on the shelf at all times</li>
    <li> I like the consistency, but it smells really strange. Like burnt lotion or something.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!  I&#x27;m in my mid 20s, and the only moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried before are Cetaphil, which made my face look super oily and did nothing for my complexion, and Mary Kay Anti-aging (long story) Moisturizer, which wasn&#x27;t very moisturizing at all and again did nothing for the red patches.  This Neutrogena moisturizer is awesome! I got it about a week ago from Amazon and already it has toned-down the redness on my cheeks and chin.  I feel like I can get away without using foundation for like the first time ever.  I do have a couple acne scars, and I&#x27;m not sure it it&#x27;s done anything for those yet, but I&#x27;ve only used it for about a week.  It&#x27;s the perfect amount of moisture, it evens out my skin tone, and it has a nice smell.  I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone with an uneven skin tone because it does what it says it&#x27;ll do and it does it fast.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews for products, but I am so impressed by this one&#x27;s effectiveness, I just had to chime in. After just a few weeks, I have noticed a SIGNIFICANT lightening of my age/sun spots. I have several large ones that I have been watching closely and seeing great improvement. I have also noticed a difference in the redness my cheeks have had since childhood. I use this in conjunction with the night version. Makeup applies very nicely on top and I appreciate the SPF in the daytime version. High quality results for a very low price!</li>
    <li> I have always had good results with this product until I ordered it from Amazon.  When it came in the mail, there was a note that the original packaging was lost so they gave me two products to make up for it.  I was super excited!  However, I gave this 2 months and the 2nd free bottle 1 month before I just had to throw them away.  I think the seller put some other kind of lotion inside this bottle.  Honestly, it was crazy how I&#x27;ve never had any problems with this moisturizer and then after 2 days of using the one from Amazon, I got little tiny pimples, like baby 1x1mm whiteheads all over my forehead.  After the 3 months of dealing with the annoying little forehead pimples, I finally threw it away like I said and the pimples went away within a few days.  I should have thrown the bottles away in the first week, but I wanted to give it a chance and didn&#x27;t want to waste it after I had already paid for it.  I would not recommend getting this product on-line.</li>
    <li> Thank you great purchase!!</li>
    <li> Not as advertised.  This is supposed to be a color corrected product and instead it has no color in it.  Pleasant enough to use, I don&#x27;t find it is helpful to my skin; just not harmful.  Clinique makes a better color correcting CC type cream.</li>
    <li> Is this product supposed to lighten dark spots, or darken the rest of my face so the spots are less noticeable?  I like the consistency and the way my skin feels.  Sadly, I&#x27;m not a fan of whatever color it&#x27;s turning me. Probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been on a quest for a facial sunscreen with spf 30 or higher that doesn&#x27;t make me break out and feel like my skin can&#x27;t breathe. This is it. I wear this on my walks in the summer heat and I don&#x27;t feel gross, haven&#x27;t broken out. As a matter of fact, my skin is in better condition than before. Time will tell if it fades my one sun spot I have on my left cheek that has been making me crazy! At least I have not collected other spots! I&#x27;m fair and have been wearing sunscreen my whole life and have tried many, many facial sunscreens over the years. This is by far one of the best!</li>
    <li> It appears that it is discontinued. Is that true?</li>
    <li> This easy to use product seems to work about as well as a prescription product which is more drying to the skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for approx. 2 weeks,  have seen a slight difference&lt;br /&gt;in the color of the age spots.  They seem to be getting lighter.</li>
    <li> used it for several years and does an excellent job of sun protection and skin correction.  Be careful which Amazon merchant you purchase from; last one sent a bottle with 4 months of remaining shelf life before its expiration date!</li>
    <li> I just finished my first bottle and feel more comfortable without makeup and no longer need concealer. I have brown skin and had dark acne scars. I still use foundation to even my skin tone, but definitely notice a difference. However it will dry your skin out for the first few weeks so you will need to interchange with a good moisturizer and use a scrub like St. Ive&#x27;s for the dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For acne scars it works best if you also take other measures to help your skin, like washing makeup off completely, not messing with acne, changing your pillowcase and not touching your face. There&#x27;s no miracle cream but this is pretty close.</li>
    <li> Thank you, I love this and when I run out I will be buying again. Thank you very much A+.</li>
    <li> Broke my skin out.  What is it about Neutrogena \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; products?  Along with Clinique, they seem to be the absolute worst for my sensitive, acne-prone skin. Although I will use their soap until I die.  :)</li>
    <li> I use Beautypedia.com to search for products that will actually work. This moisturizer was great. Loved that it had SPF an retinol as well. Sat well under makeup, even with my oily skin. Shipment was quick!</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff! It seems to have lessened a few acne scars and it works great under makeup!&lt;br /&gt;I like that it contains Retinol and is still gentle on my skin. The price is PERFECT!&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful - it STINGS like a b_tch if you get it in your eye by accident while putting on eye makeup!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light weight and finishes matte. No residue nor break-out for my hyper sensitive skin. I&#x27;m not sure if it actually did anything to correct my skin tone but I bought for its safe ingredients and SPF. My only complaint is the container. I had to unscrew the cap to shake it out for about the last 1/4 of it which contradicts with the sanitary purpose of the pump. Wish it came in a tube.</li>
    <li> The serum applies smoothly, but is a bit irritating to the eyes even if I avoid that area. Also, don&#x27;t put it on before working out! The serum in the forehead will drip down into your eyes and burn.</li>
    <li> Love the finish. High quality cosmeceutical packaged so that anti-oxidants remain stable.</li>
    <li> I use this to reduce dark aging spots on my face.  The product works well but in general it is expensive for this brand.</li>
    <li> This lotion is incredible! After just a few days I noticed an improvement and now I barely have to put any concealer on. My acne was really bad while I was pregnant and even after a year you could still see the dark spots, not anymore! I LOVE this lotion and am so grateful to my friend who gave me the last bit in her bottle to try. Definitely worth every penny.</li>
    <li> actually product is not just &#x27;okay&#x27; - it&#x27;s the best! - i would order 10 of them if they were not so stupidly and unreasonably EXPENSIVE!  forget this!  now i just mix a fine facial lotion with a foundation in my palm and get the same results.  Neutro, you&#x27;re losing this customer.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  My skin looked beautiful in just a few days and has continued to improve.  It gave me that smoothness and pore size reduction that I have been looking for for a long time.  I hope this product is not canceled any time soon.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like.It is some sort of allergic staff, seems to me because a lots of components have citrus base. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to some  people who  have allergies from citruses...</li>
    <li> Helped my skin become smoother and softer in 2 weeks. I react poorly to many facial products and this just feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> This does a great job under makeup.  It doesn&#x27;t have a high SPF and doesn&#x27;t cause my makeup to look greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this at least once a day for over a month and I love it. I used to just wash my face and do nothing to moisturize my face after showering. I began to notice small red discolorations on my cheeks and I would get the occasional zit. Now my face has evened out significantly, is smooth, and I haven&#x27;t had a zit since using it. Great moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and this really helps it feel moisturized without a grease feel. I have only been using it for about 2 weeks so I have not yet noticed a big improvement in skin tone (hence why I only gave it 4 stars). But so far I&#x27;m loving it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> When my local store stopped handling this I was quite upset. I had been using it for several months and I had just been to see my dermatologist who approved it as a good one to use. When I checked on Amazon, I was thrilled to discover it for much less than I had been paying! I like it because it includes both Retinol and sunscreen.  I use it every morning and can tell that my skin has improved with use. I have no problem with dry spots or it being oily. I am in my 60&#x27;s and find it to be perfect for me. In the past, I have had problems with sunscreen products causing pimples but not this. If I am to be out in the sun, I wear a hat so I think this spf will be strong enough for me. I have fair skin and have never tried to be tan. Protecting my skin is important and it has paid off in helping me to look much younger.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of other products, this is the one! My skin looks and feels great. It also helps keep my acne at bay. It&#x27;s not labeled as an acne product, but I&#x27;ve tried everything else and this is the only thing that has helped. I love the fact that it&#x27;s also SPF 30.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help my dark spots.</li>
    <li> Overall good, but it burns my eyes...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week. I will keep using it until it&#x27;s gone because I hate to waste money. Here&#x27;s what I don&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The smell. Way too much fragrance, and it&#x27;s not nice.  It doesn&#x27;t diminish over time either. I can&#x27;t wait to wash it off each day.&lt;br /&gt;2.  It&#x27;s too shiny. The shine from this product makes my skin look oily.  I feel like I have to wear make up over it on workdays to present a professional appearance in the office.&lt;br /&gt;3.  It is advertised as &#x27;tone correcting&#x27;, but has no tone correcting effect. I have only mild age spots, but this does nothing to even out my complexion.</li>
    <li> I have used Neutrogena products for almost 15 years and this moisturizer for probably 4-5 years.  I love it because it isn&#x27;t greasy, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, has an spf included, and I feel like it gives my skin a refreshed look after I apply it.  I get compliments on my complexion all the time and I definitely owe some of that to this moisturizer!  I find it is a little bit more expensive than other products out there, but it is worth every penny to me.</li>
    <li> No difference after four months</li>
    <li> Purchased this product prior to  Amazon at retail store seems to be a lot thicker maybe old does not fade into skin as easily does not seem to be as effective either</li>
    <li> I am big on sunscreen and always use while going out, even if it is cloudy. Neutrogena Ageless Intensive Tone Correcting moisturizer with SPF 30 is the only sunscreen I will use, it not only keeps my skin protected but also contains retinol and definitely has helped in keeping my skin clear overall as well as diminishing scars and fine lines/wrinkles.  I have occasionally tried other sunscreens but I always end up going back to this one.  I also Iike that it does not make my skin excessively oily as other sunscreens usually do, nor leave a white residue.  This is definitely a product I will not leave my house without applying!</li>
    <li> I use this every day! It goes on very light, gives good coverage and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like many higher spf creams. I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and it can&#x27;t be beat.  My one complaint is that the dispenser stops working while there is still a lot of moisturizer left in the container. I usually end up storing it on it&#x27;s side, and unscrewing the cap to get more out. Given the price, it is worth the extra effort to stretch it out!</li>
    <li> My wife loves the stuff. It&#x27;s no longer available in NZ in the old recipe/formula (now contains less of the active ingredients and costs way more) so she was glad to be able to find it in the US, especially at a much cheaper price (about 1/2 price and that included shipping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each bottle lasts about a month. I don&#x27;t see the point of it but it makes her happy. sorry about the cliche but &amp;#34;happy wife.... happy life&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Great cream. not too heavy or light</li>
    <li> It really works! Very good at correcting tones. I have very white skin and any time I would have a breakout i would be left with reddish marks after. After a few days applying day and night the redness would be gone. I&#x27;ve seen such a difference in my skin! Plus it gives a nice healthy glow without being too oily. My skin is really sensitive to moisturizers of any kind. This is the only one I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t get a rash from and that doesn&#x27;t leave me oily. A pump and a half of this on my face is perfect!</li>
    <li> Really like it.  Hard to get the last out of the bottle though.</li>
    <li> I use this lotion twice daily and have been using it for about 2 weeks now. I use it under my makeup during the day and as a night lotion. 2 pumps seems to be perfect and mine has not run out yet, which I found a lot of people were writing in their reviews. Best thing about this lotion, I noticed a difference in my red spots (acne scars), literally the first morning after I slept with the lotion on. After almost 2 weeks, most of my acne scars have all but disappeared. And I&#x27;ll tell you, I&#x27;ve been fighting with these since junior high and I&#x27;m almost 30 now and nothing else has worked. I hope it continues to work this well, and my skin is going to be the best its ever been. Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used almost the entire bottle now.  I like it.  It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and I like the SPF protection.  I still have the same sun spot on my left cheek that I had when I began using it.  It is probably a shade lighter than it was when I started, but it is still there.  I will continue using the Neutrogena Ageless Intensive Tone Correcting Moisture though because like I said, it&#x27;s a good moisturizer.  Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and doesn&#x27;t make my makeup run plus it has the added benefit of 30 SFP.  And who knows?  Maybe after a second bottle the spot will be even less noticable.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice lotion for day wear and I do think that it actually reduces fine lines but the fact that it contains mica drives me crazy. Mica is that sheeny substance that is supposed to give you a glow. Well, I think that a little shiny extenuated the fine lines that I am trying to get rid of. Not a deal breaker though, I just add a matt finish (DHC velvet skin coat) on top of the tone correcting lotion. I think that it evening out my tone but it isn&#x27;t a great noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;I will stick with this affordable lotion for the retinol sunscreen combo that works well.</li>
    <li> made me break out, red bumps then second i put it on... the retinal suppost&lt;br /&gt;to even out and reduce dark spots along with the vitamin C... what i seen was&lt;br /&gt;the direct opposite.. it doesnt tone doesnt reduce againg,, it acutally increases againg..&lt;br /&gt;not for me but give it a try,,, everyone skin respons differently..</li>
    <li> This sinks immediately into the skin. It&#x27;s very light weight but provides enough moisture to keep my combination skin hydrated and not feeling tight. I have a warmer complexion and this does not leave a white sun screen cast either. About two pumps of this product covers my face and neck. Overall I really have no complaints. I&#x27;ve invested in products that were 5 times more expensive and higher end and this has outperformed them. What&#x27;s even better is that this has the packaging helps keep the retinol stable, there are traces of green tea in this and the formula contains amounts of two forms of Vitamin E. The only negative thing is that this seriously burns if you get it too close to your eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this steadily for over a year now.  I wish I had taken before and after pictures.  I use to rely on foundation, as my skin was very uneven, but I don&#x27;t even wear foundation anymore.  My skin discolorations have faded, and my skin looks brighter and has a glow.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> I swear I cannot live with out this product. I bought it on recommendation from someone else, read reviews and ordered it. When I got it, I tried it immediately and as soon as it was on my face I could feel it working. My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive but I am allergic to many things (even hypoallergenic face products) and I don&#x27;t have any allergic reaction to this, but it is a strong face lotion. I have fine lines on my forehead and as soon as I run out, there they are again. My skin feel better, brighter, it looks healthy. Don&#x27;t get it on your lips or too close to your eyes. This product is worth the 13-20 bucks and its worth a try. A definite con, the bottle is small.</li>
    <li> I bought this two days ago and my skin looks better already. I&#x27;ve had acne scars for years and they seem to be fading already and my skin looks brighter and less dull. I also use [[ASIN:B00157S30Q Avon Anew Clinical Advanced Retexturizing Peel (30 Pads)]] which also helps fade my acne scars and makes my skin look more even toned and healthier, but it dries out my skin so this tone correcting moisturizer really compliments it.</li>
    <li> Decided to start using a daily sunscreen, now that I&#x27;m 30. It&#x27;s a good habit that I should have started 10 years ago. This product goes on nice and isn&#x27;t greasy or shiny.</li>
    <li> I just keep on buying this product, because it WORKS!  It has faded out some of my darker patches, and evened out my skin tone.  It&#x27;s also a great, non-greasy moisturiser, and my skin has never felt better.  I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s and would highly recommend this cream to women of all ages.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 61 and have been using this product for nearly two years. The tone of my skin is consistent and I have no blemishes. It&#x27;s also an excellent sunscreen. I tend to have an oily T zone and this product is perfect during the sweaty hot summer days. Unfortunately it is not available through subscription any longer.</li>
    <li> The services of this provider were excellent. Delivery was quick and the product was appropriately packaged.  As to the effectiveness: As a sun protection agent this product is good.  As to whether it will fade  skin dark spots, on my second bottle of the product, it may be fading dark spots on my fair skin, but it is a very slow process.  It is acceptable to me, as I know such treatment takes time.</li>
    <li> This product did everything that I wanted it to do, however it seems that it is now no longer available.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing but sorta melts into the skin nice and smoothly.  I really like it for the summer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over two years.  It was recommended by my dermatologist for moisturizing and protection.&lt;br /&gt;It is a very nice cream, no scent, absorbs completely with no &amp;#34;after feel.&amp;#34;  My light, moisturizing liquid makeup goes on smoothly&lt;br /&gt;and is more evenly with this as a base.  I am in my 60s so moisturizing is important. I am so glad I found the  right moisturizer, one that works with the other products in my regimen.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else after using this product. It makes a perfect combination with Neutrogena night serum and moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past month and I have been really please with it. The price is affordable and I will never pay for those expensive products.</li>
</ol>
