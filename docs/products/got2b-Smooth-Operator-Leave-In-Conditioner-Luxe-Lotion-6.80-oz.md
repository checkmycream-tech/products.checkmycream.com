      <li>The lotion is a nice departure.</li>
      <li>I received a sample and coupons for this product from BzzAgent in exchange for trying this product and giving my honest thoughts.    </li>

      <li>When I used this product I thought the smell was nice</li>

      <li>I was thrilled to try this product out as a Bzz Agent.</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll try the hairspray instead, though I like the flexible kind for my curls...  </li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m docking a star because although I should be a perfect target for this product, it doesn&#x27;t really jive well with my wash routine.  </li>
      <li>5 loved it including me, 2 said the product they were using was better and 1 feels that it was just ok.   </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I never had a hair lotion that wasn&#x27;t greasy until I came across this. It makes my hair feel so soft and I am talking about coarse, thick, transitioning from relaxed to natural hair. The smell was also a pleasant surprise. I am sticking with this for as long as the company makes it. It&#x27;s the best hair lotion ever for my hair!</li>
    <li> First of all, the bottle is defective, the lotion oozes out when I am not even using it.  I applied it to towel dried hair and styled as per the instructions but my hair seems frizzy as a result.  I will continue to use, maybe this time was a fluke - I hope so.  My stylist uses Redken on my damp hair, maybe I need to go that route.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this from Bzzagent to try and review. I have really thick, wavy hair that I straighten with a blowdryer and flat iron every other day. I&#x27;m always looking for products to help my hair look smooth and shiny.    The first thing I noticed about this product is the smell. It smells kind of fruity-so yummy! I rubbed a dime sized amount between my hands and ran my hands through my dry, already straightened hair and it smoothed the flyaways and gave my hair a little more shine without feeling greasy or weighed down. It also made my hair smell great! I will continue to use this as a finishing touch for my hair after straightening.</li>
    <li> Not much works to keep my hair smooth in summer humidity. I have long, wavy, frizzy, super-duper thick hair and generally by the time I&#x27;m done straightening it the hair at the nape of my neck is already curling again. But with this product my hair stayed straight and smooth all day, and the best part was that my hair felt super soft. The product didn&#x27;t make my hair get stiff or crunchy at all, it left it feeling, looking, and smelling amazing!</li>
    <li> I received this product through BzzAgent. I have to say I wish they also made a hair freshening spray with the heavenly scent! LOVE it! To me, it smells like a lighter scented version of Strawberries and Champagne by Victoria&#x27;s SecretI don&#x27;t use heat on my hair but after getting out of the shower I run a little of it through my hair and my hair drys quite nicely with my shorter broken strands not making a halo around the top of my head. My hair isn&#x27;t weighed down at all by the product. I use a TINY amount. I like that it also has UV protection. I wish the scent lasted longer. I also use it to define my waves after I brush, it works nicely for me that way as well.</li>
    <li> I received this product through BzzAgent.  My hair is thick, curly and frizzy.  I was excited when I received the got2b Smooth Operator Lustre Lotion.  I like the fact that you can apply it while your hair is wet or dry.  I straighten my hair so I need something like this to protect it from the heat.  I made it feel soft and it also made my hair smell really nice.</li>
    <li> Review by Aaron&#x27;s wife!    I received some coupons from Bzz Agent to try out the new line from Got 2b, Smooth Operator. I&#x27;ve had some good experiences with Got 2b products, but haven&#x27;t ever found anything I&#x27;m in love with. This time I tried the new line, Smooth Operator, which has cashmere in it. I&#x27;m all for something that can smooth my oft-frizzed tresses and make them cashmere soft. I chose the Smoothing Luxury Mousse and the Smoothing Lustre Lotion. I used the mousse on towel-dried hair before styling, and the lotion after blow-drying and styling. I tried both of them alone and together.      The good:  The Smooth Operator line protects against heat damage from your blow dryer and flat iron, and contains a UV protectant, to fight off that nasty Arizona summer sun. I was impressed with how soft and silky my hair turned out. Which was especially nice in the summer, when the sun and chlorine can sometimes make it, um, not soft and silky. These products, especially the mouse, created major volume - a plus for many people. And I love that Got 2b comes close to salon-brands, but at a very affordable price point. You can get most of the products for under $5 at your grocery store or drug store.      The bad:  Lots of volume. This can be a plus for some, and usually I&#x27;m looking for products to boost volume, but with my current unfortunate hair cut (I&#x27;m growing out some funky layers &amp; wish it was all 4 inches longer), it created way too much volume for me. Especially when I used both products together. It was pretty wild.      I&#x27;m going to hold onto the other half of my bottles for when my hair grows out a little bit. I think it will be perfect then! In the meantime, a little Lustre Lotion goes a long way to smooth and soften my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought the Got2B Smooth Operator Smoothing Lustre Lotion from Walgreens today and am pleased with my purchase.  I have fine, course, dry, damaged hair, and this leave-in conditioner made my hair soft, smooth and moisturized.  The only problem is that after you flat-iron your hair, it dries it out a little bit, but at 410 degrees, some drying out is to be expected.  I previously used L&#x27;Oreal Leave-In Humidity Defying Creme, but Got2B is much better.  L&#x27;Oreal left my hair VERY dry after straightening, so bad that I might as well not have used the product at all.  My options on leave-in conditioners are limited because I&#x27;m very sensitive to strong smells (ex: aerosol hairspray smell), but Got2B has only a faint, pleasant odor.  Another plus: this product was less than $5, and I got $2 in extra rewards bucks when I bought it!</li>
    <li> I first got a sample from my bzzagent kit but couldn&#x27;t wait to go get a regular size bottle because 1. I LOVE the smell of this product.  2.  It is super lightweight! 3. It really does help control frizz!!  The bottle is so cute and girly too!  You&#x27;ve got2 love that!</li>
    <li> I was recently lucky enough to get a sample from being a Bzz Agent--and I have to say that this product is GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first put it on my hands I noticed how great the smell is. It&#x27;s a mixture of fruit and floral--and made my hair smell like I left the salon {which is my favorite smell ever}. After rubbing it onto my hands and into my hair I loved how my hair wasn&#x27;t greasy feeling or looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also didn&#x27;t weigh down my hair which is a huge plus. I have thick hair, medium length and so many products leave my hair hanging really heavy. Living on the Gulf Coast in Mississippi I would recommend it to anyone needing help to fight the frizzies and wanting a product that won&#x27;t break the bank. Is it as good as a high end salon product? Probably not. But if you are looking for something affordable to help you through the summer then this product is definitely for you.</li>
    <li> First off, this product has a fantastic scent! But even better, it really does make my hair soft, shiny and it doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down in the least. I have long hair and always blow dry -- the smoothing lustre lotion seems to keep my hair under control and, as I said, leaves it really soft. And smelling great, too!</li>
    <li> I am also a bzz agent - and queen of the flyaways.  I was anxious to see how this product would react with my hair.  Did I notice any difference in the luster?  No.  Did I notice any difference in flyways?  Absolutely.  The product provided far more control over my hair than anything else I had every tried.  I also liked the fact that my hair didn&#x27;t feel stiff and it smelled great.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product, and I used it for about a week. I would describe my hair has long, fine, and a lot of it. Certain products (like serums) weigh my hair down and/or make it look greasy. This product did not. It smelled great, and the bottle is cute enough where you would keep it out in your bathroom and not be embarrassed. But, I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in my hair. It smelled great, but didn&#x27;t look or feel much different than it normally does. I think I would try this brand again, but the hairspray instead.</li>
    <li> hey girls // like some members i&#x27;m a buzz agent too and received this product to try .. I have frizzy n curly hair .. n i do use a lot many products to keep them manageable .. the first time i used it i used it with my other hair products ...i used got2b smooth operator and anti frizz serum (some other brand ) at same time and it was  a disaster ..my hair weighed down i wanted to give it a second try and used it with directions and volla .. what a great product ..    it is very light non greasy    easily gets into hair     great smell    and really smoothens  hair gives hair soft texture ,, worked for me girls               i&#x27;m a busy mom dont have much time to spend on hair i simply used got2b smooth operator and used iron on low heat setting just getting it thru hair once and ended up with good hair day :))))</li>
    <li> I received this sample as a Bzz Agent to review. I used this product in my hair towel dried as it directed. I blew it out as I normally would. I noticed at the end, it seemed like it was lacking the body I normally get from a blow out. The lustre lotion appeared more to oil my hair and weigh it down. It did smell so great. I gave it a second try. I put it after blowing out my hair. I used barely a pea sized amount, and put it under my hair (near the back of the neck) and then smoothed it over the top. I have very fine, thin hair, so products as such I must apply in small quantities. It added shine, and did control the light frizz I had. Based on my experience with this I would use as a smoother in a small amount, so even the sample will last me a long time! I might give the product one more shot with towel dried hair. This product may more be for people with thicker hair to ease frizz and not the ladies with fine hair; because it will oil.</li>
    <li> Not only does this tame my thin frizzy hair, but it smells amazing. I normally have issues with putting lotion like products in my hair. I have thin hair and it gets weighed down so easily. With Smooth Operator, it doesn&#x27;t matter if I put it on wet or dry, it goes on easily and makes my hair feel so silky and soft and takes care of the little frizzies. I love it.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of the Got2Be Smooth Operator from Bzz Agent and was asked to give it a try.  I was hesitant at first because a lot of product tends to weigh down my hair.  I&#x27;m glad I did try it though.    It gave my naturally curly/wavy hair real curl definition and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all.  My hair stayed \\&quot;touchable\\&quot; as well and doesn&#x27;t feel stiff or sticky. Its a pretty great product.  Not much scent.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to try this product out as a Bzz Agent. I love trying out new beauty products!     Overall, I was really impressed with this product and it stood up well to more expensive salon smoothing lotions I&#x27;ve used in the past. One of my favorite things might be it&#x27;s great scent. Since the product was a lotion, it didn&#x27;t weigh down my hair like some of the silicon based smoothing serums I&#x27;ve used before.  My hair is already fairly healthy but it did help to soften the ends which can be a little rougher and split. I really love that it helps protect my hair from futher heat styling damage.     Despite the claims on the label, I didn&#x27;t have much luck with the product helping to shape my hair or providing a visible luster. Still, I will continue to purchase the product to protect my hair from styling and UV damage and to provide a lightweight softness with a great scent.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of Got2Be Smooth Operator Lustre Lotion from BzzAgent to try.  I think I&#x27;m a perfect target for this particular product because I have long, thick, wavy-curly hair that is prone to being frizzy and flyaway without any product applied.  My normal routine is to apply John Frieda Frizz-Ease Serum after a shower, so I was anxious to find out of the Lustre Lotion would provide a similar or superior finish.    The Pros:        * Excellent at smoothing down flyaways.  My hair was very sleek.      * Added some weight to my hair while keeping body at the scalp.  My hair is so thick that it is frequently a bit too unruly and lion-mane like, but the Lustre Lotion weighed it down just enough      * Nicely curl defining, despite that not being one of the main thrusts.  My hair really looked awesome with this product applied.    Overall my hair looked very nice when I used Lustre Lotion.  It had great body and better defined curls, and frizz/flyaways were nonexistent.    However it doesn&#x27;t get 4 stars because for me there were some definite cons...    I only wash my hair every third day, which is in line with recommendations for my hair type.  This means I have two days where my hair is not washed.  I found this product to be a bit heavy on these two days.  My hair looked oilier/more dirty near my scalp, particularly on the second day.  It also made my hair feel crunchy on the first day of application, which indicates a heavier product than I am used to.  By the time day 3 came around I was definitely ready to wash my hair, where generally it usually still looks great and I just wash it because going any longer seems gross.  So my cons...        * Heavy product that adds buildup      * Hair needs more frequent washing      * Can make hair oily near scalp    So I&#x27;m docking a star because although I should be a perfect target for this product, it doesn&#x27;t really jive well with my wash routine.  For those who wash more frequently it is probably perfect.    I do actually really like it.  It definitely controls frizz BETTER than my Frizz Ease serum.  I will use this product instead of frizz ease if I know I will be washing sooner.  I also believe that Got2Be makes a serum like frizz ease that I will probably try.  I did really like the scent of the product.  I think the charms on the bottle are frivolous and wasteful.    Overall:  Recommended, but better if you wash your hair a lot.</li>
    <li> I received a coupon for this product as a Bzz Agent. It actually worked well for my hair, even with bad weather conditions. It help reduce my frizzy, fly away hairs and made my hair feel really smooth. I&#x27;ve tried other similar products like frizz ease, chi, and bio silk. This product gave me better results than those and smells great! I used it on damp hair, as a heat protectant for styling, and to catch random fly-aways on dry hair. Overall, I had great results with the lustre lotion. However, like most other hair products, I still had to be careful not to use too much so it wouldn&#x27;t weigh down my hair, but I experience this problem less than the other ones.</li>
    <li> My friends and I are on our way to a bachelorette party, and we decided to get ready at my place. So this was a perfect timing to whip out Got2b Smooth Operator. Most of them are familiar with the brand and have used some of their products but not this one.   5 loved it including me, 2 said the product they were using was better and 1 feels that it was just ok.   Either way we concluded that this is a worthy product. Smeels awesome, and it does what it is supposed to, hair feels smooth, soft, shiny, and no greasy heavy feel.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the reviews that say this is for teens or someone under 30, sway you away. I&#x27;m older than that and after discovering this gem for my thick curly hair (after years of expensive name brand products that DONOTWORK)....I can&#x27;t recommend it enough. I&#x27;m sensitive to smells and I never notice any lingering stink or perfume from these hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many ways you can use this wonderful product, if you apply it to wet/damp curly hair and let it air dry, you get glossy defined curls with no frizz. If you are blowdrying your hair, it leaves you with manageable shiny hair. It also acts great as a setting lotion if you like curlers. It&#x27;s so versatile and if you have frizzy dry curly hair, you really MUST try it. And you might have to use a quarter-size dollop or so, but don&#x27;t be afraid of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually start with the Crazysleek protectant, rub in some Smooth Operator, lightly blow dry and then spritz my still-damp hair with Kinkier (all by Got2B). My hair looks fabulous all day!&lt;br /&gt;If straightening, I start with the Crazysleek and a little Smooth Operator, blow dry straight as possible, spray in the 425 protectant and then go to town with the flatiron.&lt;br /&gt;Always great!  And Walgreens has them B1G1 once or twice a year so they are a real bargain!</li>
    <li> I was excited to get the chance to receive a free sample due to being a buzz agent.  I tend to pull my hair back a lot due to working out and therefore I end up with a lot of fly aways/broken hair.  I&#x27;ve used several different products that help for a little bit, but that&#x27;s it.   I tried this product the day after I received it in the mail.  I tend to blow dry my hair and then straighten it in sections, so I put it on the top layer after I did this and at first I wasn&#x27;t sure about the product.  I thought I put too much on and it would be noticeable.  However I kept running my hands through my hair and my hair ended up incredibly soft and no noticeable buildup.  I also noticed that it did keep the fly aways down.  I checked my hair whenever I was in the bathroom that day and it did a really good with the fly aways.   I did this for several days, same result, and I was happy with the result.  Then I decided to try putting the product on after I used the blow drier but before I straightened my hair.  This made it work even better!   I love the results.   I&#x27;ve tried more expensive products that didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as this one.  I&#x27;m sold on the product and I know I&#x27;ll be buying it once I run out of the free sample.</li>
    <li> No comparison, whatsoever.  The göt2b® smooth operator smoothing lustre lotion can not even stand a chance against curly hair, with it&#x27;s thick and sticky texture and heavy weight.  Last week I received a sample from BzzAgent trying the reformulated hair product, the new-and-improved version having an indulgent cashmere infusion.  I made the mistake of putting the lotion on my hair post-styling, as to smooth over my hair, as I do usually with BioSilk Silk Therapy.  I have very large curls naturally; the Lustre Lotion stole all of my volume almost immediately!    This week I tried the lotion as I was straightening my hair.  I only occasionally straighten my hair, as it dries my locks out and does significant damage over time.  However, it was a special occasion and I wanted my hair to look ah-mazing!  I have the Göt2b® smooth operator smoothing lustre lotion from BzzAgent another try.  Alas, the goop did it again: completely disappointed me!  I even tried applying the lotion before I began styling, as well as afterward.  The only way I was able to save my locks and make them look decent again before my evening out was with BioSilk Silk Therapy.    The göt2b® smooth operator smoothing lustre lotion may be great for those with super straight hair, but my thick, curly, lustrous locks hated it.  Disappointing because it smells really great!  Maybe I&#x27;ll try the hairspray instead, though I like the flexible kind for my curls...  Oh, the endless search for a good hair products!</li>
    <li> I got free samples of this product for free from BzzzAgent.  It makes the hair really shiny (borderline oily if too much is used) and does a pretty good job of smoothing.  However, the smell is SOOOOOO DELICIOUS!!!  Everyone who smells this wants to use it, even if they don&#x27;t need it.  The smell is a 5+, but the overall is a 4...could be a little softer and more touchable and then it would be perfect!</li>
    <li> This lotion has a light floral scent to it and it feels so soft in your hands, you&#x27;ll be temped to use it as a hand lotion :)    I tend to put too much product in my hair and even with that fault of mine, it still did the trick! My hair was smooth and super shiny, no frizz at all! Worth it&#x27;s price and it is my new favorite product.</li>
    <li> I really like this product for my hair. I have very heavy, curly big hair! This product actually kept it tamed throughout most of the day. I have tried a lot of other products, but this one did not have to be reapplied throughout the day, which I really liked. Overall, great product. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it the full 5 stars is it&#x27;s a little pricey for me.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product. Not only does it smell good, but it works great at smoothing down frizz and flyaways without making your hair look greasy. Also, the amazon price is at least half off what I&#x27;ve seen in retail stores!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product recently through a coupon I received from being a BzzAgent.  My hair is straight and shoulder length.  I have a tendency to have a lot of fly away hair.  I noticed right away the pleasant fragrance of this product.  It was easy to apply, and didn&#x27;t feel greasy on my hair.  I did notice that my hair was a little shinier and less disheveled over the course of the day.  For me, that is an noticeable improvement from my current&#x27;s hair condiiton.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product through BzzAgent. Though I don&#x27;t have frizzy hair, I am prone to fly-aways. This lotion helps tame those and makes my hair silky and smooth looking without making it greasy looking.  The lotion smells great so when I get done styling my hair I feel like I just left the salon.</li>
    <li> It meets my expectation. The hair are soothed. The product is not oily at all but can be styled.  Just that it contains relativly strong peach odor. I am personally not bothered by this.</li>
    <li> I think this product is really nice.  I actually used it to make my hair more curly and it did great.  I used it on my bangs then used my straightener and it also did a good job.  I think this product is worth a try!</li>
    <li> I tried this product because I was given a coupon for a free trial bottle. It sounded like a great product, but I am always hesitant until I see the results. The lustre lotion truly made my hair soft. Really, really soft. It works as it says it does. However, I have curly hair and it made my curls go limp. If I bought this product again, I would probably get the mousse to see if it holds my curls better. I recommend this product (and the lustre lotion in particular) to girls with straight hair for it will make their hair really soft and they don&#x27;t have to worry about curls going limp.</li>
    <li> I used to have long hair, and tried this product on my long hair. It did not work at all. I recently cut my hair, and this product does wonders on my short hair. It smooths it beautifully. It smells great, and does not feel sticky or stiff. I wonder if I didn&#x27;t use enough product on my long hair, but I already felt like I was using a ton.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that smells incredible!  It really helped keep my naturally curly hair smooth and sleek without any flyaways.  I have used it for a few days and am feeling a little bit of build up but I think that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday.  This would work great if I were using a flat iron on my hair to straighten it!  Can&#x27;t wait to try that!  I&#x27;m a BzzAgent and I received a sample of this product along with coupons to try out and review.  I was also able to pass some along to my friends!</li>
    <li> Buzz Agent kindly sent me free samples of Got 2b Smooth Operator. If I could bottle the scent for actual body use, I think I would enjoy it a lot more as it smells delish! It does help with frizzy hair, but don&#x27;t use a whole lot or your hair will become somewhat oily. I didn&#x27;t have a big issue with this, but I could see it as a potential problem. I live in a moist climate, so my hair tends to frizz, I did notice this helping control it a little bit, but I still needed to straighten my hair in order to see the results I wanted.</li>
    <li> With my longish, super thick hair I&#x27;m always on the look out for good smoothing products, especially here in the heat of Florida. So I had high hopes when I got a sample of this in the mail featuring a woman on the packaging with the sort of long, glossy hair I&#x27;d hoped for. Oh well, at least I didn&#x27;t have to pay for it.    While the product does smell amazing, and it&#x27;s certainly cheap, I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference between my hair with the product in it (applied to towel dry hair and then blow dried) versus my hair without any product in it at all. My hair was dry and frizzy. I tried again using more of the product, but still didn&#x27;t get any results. At least you can say it leaves your hair smelling good and, surprisingly, doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling greasy.    The product may actually work better on finer hair, but if you&#x27;ve got a thick head of tresses like me, keep looking.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this as a BzzAgent. I have medium length fine hair that often has fly-aways, so I was very excited to try this product. The first thing I noticed was how great it smells--like tropical fruit. I applied about a nickel size dollop to towel-dried hair and then dried my hair while using a round brush to straighten it. My hair does feel very soft and smooth, but I wish it would impart more shine to my hair.</li>
    <li> I got this product to try as a Bzz Agent.  I think it works great.  Sometimes I feel that I put too much on, but after I blowdry my hair it always feels good.  It&#x27;s not sticky or crispy and it helps my hair with frizzies and flyaways.  I live in a place with lots of humidity and it does a pretty good job.  I&#x27;ll keep using the product even after this campaign is over.</li>
    <li> I was recently sent a sample of this product by Bzz Agent to try.     My hair is REALLY straight so I wasn&#x27;t too sure this product would really help my hair out. After all, I didn&#x27;t need anything to smooth it out, it&#x27;s already straight enough!    But I decided to apply some of the lotion after washing my hair to see what it would do. I rubbed some on and then blow-dried my hair. And I was pleasantly surprised! It didn&#x27;t make my hair more limp, as these type of products usually tend to do, but it did give a nice smooth softness! It was really nice! And I loved the way it smelled, too!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of got2be Smooth Operator Smoothing Lustre Lotion  from Bzz Agent. My hair is thick, wavy, and tends to frizz. At first I hated this product, but it turned out I was just using too much product. I&#x27;ve found a small dime-size amount it perfect for my medium length hair. It does make my hair smooth without looking oily or greasy. I apply this product after towel drying my hair and then let it air dry. It allows my hair to dry in waves but not a frizzy mess. I&#x27;ve had several co-workers compliant my hair since using this product. Highly recommend especially considering the budget friendly price tag.</li>
    <li> Fair disclosure: I received a sample and coupons for this product from BzzAgent in exchange for trying this product and giving my honest thoughts.    I have wavy to curly hair, medium texture, and often by the end of the day, my hair resembles a frizzy halo more than sleek tresses.  Once I started using this product, though, it really made a difference in the flyaway.  The smell is nice, as other posters mentioned, but not overwhelming, which was a plus to me, given allergies in the family.    I rated this 4 of 5 stars because on a particularly humid day, I still got more frizzy than I liked, but for everyday use, I don&#x27;t think you can beat the results of this product for the price.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff.  It tames my super thick and wild, frizzy hair amazingly well.  I have tried dozens of products and this is for sure my favorite.  I had the opportunity to try it through Bzz and it works, plain and simple.  I flat iron and wear my hair naturally wavy and it works well for both styles.  Smells amazing too.</li>
    <li> I received some samples and coupons from [...] a few weeks back. I have tried the lotion a few times and it&#x27;s okay. I have long, thick hair and it took quite a bit to see any results. Once I applied enough product my frizzyness was tamed and my hair smelled nice. My hair wasn&#x27;t quite as shiny as I was hoping it would be. My hair is pretty shiny to begin with and I felt like the product took some of that away.</li>
    <li> I liked the way the product worked and it smells so good. It was easy to use, but only use a little at a time. It&#x27;s easy to get carried away with it. I used it on wet and dry hair and it works for both.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin hair and after years of coloring it, it has gotten rough and dry. I never thought I would be able to have the look of young shiny hair again. I have tried ALL KINDS of products and this one really works great.  After one use. I didn&#x27;t use much just dime size. Blew dry, then flat ironed and I cannot believe the results. It&#x27;s like my hair went back about 30 years in time. Very smooth, soft, shiny and it smells terrific, not per-fumy. Does a great job on keeping fly aways and frizzies smoothed down. I would highly reccomend this product-at least for fine thin hair like mine.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!! The first time I used it, I was extremely dissapointed- I saw no difference in my hair. However, I discovered that I just didnt use enough (Im used to those creams/sprays that make your hair hard and gross when over-used) This lotion doesnt weigh down your hair, or have any negative side effects (some reviewers said that it made their hair flat- My hair has plenty of volume and didnt have that problem) It does a great job and i loooove it!</li>
    <li> I received this product as part of a BzzAgent campaign, and used it during a particularly rainy week in the Midwest. It is normally difficult to keep my hair smooth during humid weather, so this was a perfect test.   1) The first thing that you will notice is that this product smells delicious. It has a really light, fruity scent. Not overpowering - just enough.   2) I am used to seeing these types of products in \\&quot;serums\\&quot;. The lotion is a nice departure. It is more of a cream. Not sticky at all. Sometimes those serums can tend to make hair look even more frizzy or even a little oily. Not the case with this. It is marketed as being infused with cashmere (seems like tricky marketing to me, to be honest; I&#x27;m not sure how putting wool in your hair could be beneficial - it just sounds luxurious, so we fall for it).   3) The product worked well at taming frizzies on my long, curly hair, but I found that it wasn&#x27;t enough to just apply in the AM and forget about it. Frizzies and fly-aways popped up throughout the day, so I find myself using it a few times throughout the day to keep the frizz in check. If you have short or fine hair, you may get away with using it less.  4) The product does not have much hold (it isn&#x27;t marketed that way), but there are other products in the same line that may be more successful if that&#x27;s what you like. For example, they do carry a hairspray.  Overall, I really like the product, and they really do try to make it fun to use, from the packaging to the scent, to the name of the product.</li>
    <li> I received a sample from Buzz Agent and it only took a few trials to decide to go buy a big bottle of it.  Humidity (I&#x27;m talking 100% humidity in Louisiana), flat iron, blow dryer is NO MATCH.  It works and it works without weighing it down or becoming greasy.  This product has cut my styling time in half!  It is such a good value!</li>
    <li> I recieved a sample from bzzagent and valuable coupons.I have never ever tried this product but i now i feel so good about my hair .This product is great with the lustre cream from Got2b,When I used this product I thought the smell was nice and it made my hair soft ,It smoothed out my tresses and eliminated frizzy ends.I have very long hair so it works for me too,also i love the packaging of the bottle,pretty nice charm ....i guess i have to buy the bottle since i just recieved the sample in packets.so would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed by this product.  I agree with the others who say the scent was amazing... I continue to use tiny amounts just for that reason.  However, the product itself left lots to be desired.  I have long, curly hair that gets frizzy easily in humidity.. no matter how much crap I put in it.  The Smooth Operator seemed to solve that problem, in a way, but made my hair so heavy, dark and oily that I couldn&#x27;t do anything with it.  Also, when the product \\&quot;dried\\&quot; my hair felt extremely knotty and snarled.  I use quotes on \\&quot;dried\\&quot; because my hair never appeared to be dry.. it looked wet even hours after applying the stuff.  But a half wet, really oily, dirty kind of appearance.  Frizz-ease, though not so nice smelling, is by far a superior product.</li>
    <li> This product works well for my hair (thick &amp; wavy). It helps take the frizz out and helps smooth my hair. It also smells nice.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for awhile. It has been with me through my long to short hair styles. I love the way it smells and the design. I can tell when I don&#x27;t use it because my hair looks drier and it&#x27;s flying everywhere.I have fairly thick hair and I don&#x27;t use much but my hair only comes to my shoulders and is short in back. I use it just before I straight iron my hair and it makes it look shiny and healthy! I will never stop using this!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. This order was earlier than I expected.  Just a wonderful experience all together.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 4 star and the packaging i&#x27;m giving 2 stars because it was bit up,like it&#x27;s been miss treated Lol!&lt;br /&gt;aND WHEN i SAW THIS PRODUCT ON AMAZON I decided to purchase it because of the little charm that supposed to come hanging on it, The bottle says\\&quot; charm is not a toy\\&quot; however there is no charming onn this particular item.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I don&#x27;t do a lot of stuff for my self, but this was the perfect treat for my hair and self confidence. I was thinking it was going go be a small bottle for the price but I was wrong, its a large and tall bottle. The smell is amazing, it smells like a candy shop. My husband (when hugging me) commented on my hair smelling good, and just for that I will forever buy this stuff. Its a lot like palmaide, but better. It smoothes out my mommy fly-aways and regular fly-aways. It makes my hair shinny and shimmery. Its smooth and lightweight, best of all it doesn&#x27;t over do it in my hair like other products do. My hair never feels greasy, but does feel soft. It comes with cute charms attached to it, you can use them on a charm bracelet or necklace, or like me a keychain.</li>
    <li> I received some samples for free from buzz agent.. I kept a sample and handed the rest out to my friends..  The smell is so yummy!  I washed my hair, applied the cream then blow dried it.  While not ALL of my frizzies went away most did and my hair smelled yummy.  My GF applied it thinking it would help her hair stay down- she is trying to make her bangs stay to the side and it did not help.. another GF applied it on dry hair and said it made her hair feel weighted down and \\&quot;goopy\\&quot; and another GF said she washed her hair then applied it and it made her thin hair feel oily.</li>
    <li> I received this product as part of a Buzz Campaign. I have fine hair straight hair. I did like the smell of the product and that it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. The product is light and not greasy. I applied it when my hair was towel dried. I felt that it made my hair softer but I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in shine and I still had some flyaways. I felt the product was basically average for what it is but it is at a better price point than similar products so it is worth a try.</li>
    <li> I am a BzzAgent and received a free sample of this product to try and offer my opinion of. I tried the product twice and had good results both times. I used it right after washing my hair and the lotion detangled my hair right away and made it very easy to brush through. I have fine hair and this product added a little more volume to it. My hair was soft and looked polished, like it was just brushed with a bristle brush. It didn&#x27;t make my hair as shiny as I would have hoped, but to be fair, I didn&#x27;t use a lot because I didn&#x27;t want to weigh my hair down. I would recommend this product and will probably continue to use it on occasion, especially when I need a good detangler.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of got2be Smooth Operator Smoothing Lustre Lotion from Bzz Agent. My hair is chin length, thin and straight with little hairs that poke up.  I usually NEVER put hair product in my hair because I hate smelling my hair scent all day and I don&#x27;t like the feeling of stuff in my hair.  I use a nickel sized amount on wet towel dried hair in the morning.  I found my hair seems to blow dry faster with the smoothing lotion - nice bonus! I think the fragrance of the hair lotion is pleasant and not overwhelming, even first thing in the morning.  My hair is soft and smooth - reminds me of my daughter&#x27;s new baby hair!  I love how it feels with the lotion applied!  I also notice less little hairs poking up.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s winter time. It&#x27;s that time of year that my long, thick hair decides it doesn&#x27;t like me very much. It tries everything it can to make me miserable.  It flies as far away from me as possible. When I try to pull it back down I swear it sounds like there&#x27;s a faulty wire somewhere. Snap. Crackle. Pop. ZAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried EVERYTHING to tame my static charged hair. Dry oil? It just bands the static-charged hair together so I have clumps of hair sticking up. Leave-in conditioner? Oily/greasy looking, static-zapping hair. I&#x27;ve even carried around drier sheets, and it was all to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re sick of the Bride-of-Frankenstein look and afraid of your own hair shocking you in defiance every time you touch it -- this stuff works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-2 pumps rubbed in both hands and worked through the hair is all it takes. It even stands up to the blow-drier. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and firmly believe I&#x27;ve found my winter salvation for my battle with static.</li>
    <li> This product smells really nice and made my hair look gorgeous. It feels soft when applying it and does not make my hair sticky or greasy; my hair moved naturally.   I have long hair and used about a quarter-sized amount when I applied it to my hair. It worked really well for me and my hair felt smooth all day. No frizz or fly-away hair.  This product can be applied in towel-dry hair or dry hair. There are other products available for this line, such as mousse, hairspray and satin drops. I have, however, only tried the lotion so far.       I have received the sample of this product for being a member of BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this stuff. First is smells great, you will smell it through out the day. Secondly, it does tame your fly a ways and it leaves your hair soft not stiff and hard. It is not sticky or oily, and you can use it as a heat protectant, you can also use it as a moisturizer. When it dries it does not weigh your hair down which is fantastic. I swear this is a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; product if you suffer from frizz or fly a ways. Great stuff, I Love It. Thanks Buzz Agent :0)</li>
    <li> I recieved a sample of this from Bzzzzagent and i am so happy i did because ha di not i am not sure i would have ever tried this product.  I have been using Frizz Ease sinc ei was 13 and as i get older it seems to being heavy on my fine curly hair.  Smooth Operator is amazing not only did it tame my flyawys and smooth my hair it did not weigh tit down at all.  So for the first time in 15 years i have finally found the perfect product for my hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  It smells wonderful and makes my curly red hair silky and smooth!  I am so glad I was given a chance to try this stuff!</li>
    <li> I was very lucky and got to try Got2B Smooth Operator as part of being a Bzz Agent. The bottle is very cute with the charms and I was also excited that the lotion did not make my hands sticky and feel gross like other similar items I have tried. Since I have been using it I have gotten tons of compliments on my hair and even my hair dresser said that my hair looked so shiny! I have big problems with frizz and this has totally calmed it down. This is really important to me since I like to wash my hair every other day. I love that it still looks nice the second day! Thanks Bzz for letting me try this product.</li>
    <li> I got this product as part of a BzzCampaign.  I used it for several days, but found that even though it smelled great and I was looking for that smooth look for the flyaways in my hair, it really isn&#x27;t made for people with thin or fine hair.  It made my hair feel somewhat heavy and greasy rather than light and smooth.  My friend, who has thicker hair, tried the product and it worked great for her.  Use of this product really is trial and error based on hair texture and strength.</li>
    <li> i m a bzzagent and got this product as a part of a bzzcampaign. when i used it for the first time, i used a lot of the lotion on my hair and it made my hair greasy and wieghed down. but the next time i used it on my hair after shower but i dried them up completely to see if it works of my fly aways and frizzes and yes i used a very litlle quantity this time. t really made my hair manageable and soft. afterwards when i starighten my hair they looked so great. i got lotsaa appreciation and even my husband said theres something different in ur hair :) i was so happy and amazed.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim. My other \\&quot;smoothing cream\\&quot; ran out and I needed a quick fix. Well, this blew the other product right out of the water. Smells sweet, and makes my nappy/friizy hair very smooth. I can feel the smoothness when I touch it.     I love that when I apply it to my dry hair, that it doesn&#x27;t look gooped on. That has always been an issue for me. I have very fine, but very thick curly, but not pretty curly hair.     I am a fan and I will freak out if they stop making this! This is by far the best hair smoothing cream I&#x27;ve come across in my 30+ years. Worth every cent!</li>
    <li> My hair was smoother and less frizzy after using this lotion! I really like the Smooth Operator products from Got2B; they all work!  I also like that Amazon has the product since I can&#x27;t find it in stores.</li>
    <li> The bottle is in the shape of a long curvy woman. I like the little trinkets hanging from it though. The smell is nice and kind of smells like sweet candy. After straightening my hair it feels a bit soft. It&#x27;s not as soft as I&#x27;d like it to be but hey, it&#x27;s only heat protectant cream--not a deep conditioner or whatever.</li>
    <li> I use this with my Herstyler flat iron, and it makes my curly hair super straight. The bottle it cute and comes with a little plastic charm. The bottle doesn&#x27;t come EXACTLY like in the picture, it&#x27;s slightly different. The scent smells fruity and sweet, it&#x27;s not the best smell but after I&#x27;m done flat ironing, it goes away. My straight hair lasts all day with out poofing or going crazy. I really like that it gets rid of all my frizzyness. I also love to use this after I shower on 80% dry hair. It keeps my curly hair from frizzing and makes it kind of wavy.</li>
    <li> I have fine, curly hair. I love this product and it gives a beautiful and silky finish that lasts all day. Used it for years. Totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> And that&#x27;s all. It left my hair kind of clumpy and sticky. I was very disappointed in this product. Ended up giving it away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for many years now &amp; I love it.....couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore so I was super excited when I found it on Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> Backstory: I went to get my haircut. They said that I was damaging my hair because I put it up everyday when I run. After my haircut, they put this frizz serum on my hair which made it INCREDIBLY soft. I found out what it was. It was INCREDIBLY expensive. We&#x27;re talking $35 for a month&#x27;s supply. I scoffed at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I did some research on the best rated hair serums and anti-frizz products. This was rated pretty high, and I got a great price so I gave it a shot. I love it!!! It is a lotion, which caught me off guard. I know it says it is a lotion, but I failed to read that part. I assumed I was getting a serum. Even with that, I am still very impressed. I think the lotion makes this a better product. I use it everyday and can tell a HUGE difference from before I used it. I put it in wet hair after my shower in the evenings. My hair stays soft and less-frizzy all the next day. It did take a couple of days of testing to get the right amount. Having almost waist length thick hair, I use one and a half pumps. I will definitely buy this product again. For the price and the way it works, it is a FANTASTIC value.</li>
    <li> I love how this products lays my hair down and makes it smell nice. I usd this when i wear my hair in a ponytail becausd it makes my hair look smooth and friz free.</li>
    <li> Im 13 and i bought this at Rite Aid, yes my mom was with me, and i tried it soon after i bought it. the smell is awesome. although, 30 minutess after i used it, i got a headache. i hope it wasnt from that. but it smells like fruity, clean, fresh, but a little strong. at rite aid they didnt come with the charm :( it seriously did keep my hair super soft, and the smell faded after a while. that was good. buy it, its awesome. good luck! (buy it at someplace like walmart or target though, see if its cheaper, Rite Aid was 6.49 plus tax)</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I highly recommend it!  It makes my hair so silky soft.  It does not make it feel like I have any product on my hair.  It protects against the heat of a blow dryer and flat iron.  You cannot beat the price either.</li>
    <li> This is by dar my favorite hair product. It works great if you need something to make your hair less dry for flat ironing.</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful, and really does make my hair softer and less frizzy. I use it before and after I use heat on my hair. And the bottle is really cute as well!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair that&#x27;s very damaged from highlighting and coloring.  It&#x27;s almost to the point of being crunchy.  I&#x27;ve been conditioning like crazy in the shower, using leave-in sprays afterward, etc, and always the same lame results.  I wanted to try a lotion versus the conditioning sprays so I got this and I am so happy I did. I don&#x27;t know what the deal is with the cashmere, if it&#x27;s what makes the difference or what, but this stuff actually SOFTENED my hair and it feels normal.  I put it on towel dried hair and let it air dry.  It&#x27;s wonderful.  I can&#x27;t say it makes my hair shine, since my curly hair isn&#x27;t known for being shiny, more like unreflective curls :-(  Straight hair has better light reflection, but I can definitely vouch for it making dry hair feel soft again!</li>
    <li> i like it alot doesnt weight my hair down gives it alittle texture and it smells great i hate when my hair is overly grease and this doesnt do that so its a great product</li>
    <li> Smells so good and makes my hair so soft and manageable, and i have thick curly hair it helps eliminate frizz. I&#x27;m so happy with this product.</li>
