      <li>Love this soap.  </li>
      <li>The best facial soap I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
      <li>so was glad to find a bar that won&#x27;t aggravate his skin.</li>
      <li>and I felt like this was more drying that</li>
      <li>My baby&#x27;s skin had been messed up by a prescribed hydrocortisone cream &amp; this helped in making her skin smooth again &amp; helped to ease her eczema</li>
      <li>Same great product.</li>

      <li>I love the texture and it works very well.</li>
      <li>Super gentle and smells clean.</li>

      <li>In fact, I&#x27;ve started carrying it in my purse because I&#x27;ve found most hand soap irritates my eczema (which is on my hands and wrists) and if I use only Cetaphil, it helps keep my skin in check.</li>

      <li>Very efective, helped a lot to hidrate.</li>

      <li>I normally use dove sensitive bar soap</li>
      <li>but it works well for me and my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>He has sensitive skin and stuggles with psoriasis.</li>
      <li>This hasn&#x27;t cleared up my eczema completely, but it has helped reduce the intensity of the rash.</li>

    <li> A perfect solution to my eczema problem. This hasn&#x27;t cleared up my eczema completely, but it has helped reduce the intensity of the rash.

    <li> This has been a great product for me since I have psoriasis and rosacea and I like to wash my face am and pm.  It fits the bill.  No need to purchase a &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; cleanser, it&#x27;s basic (ingredient wise) and gentle on my skin.  These can seem expensive but on Amazon they cost less in a pack.  I would recommend these to anyone and if your not sure, just try it and see how it does with your skin.  Use this on my main body and also my face.</li>

    <li> I have been using Cetaphil for years.  This is the same quality product I originally bought from a retail store.</li>

    <li> So much better than the liquid soap! Great deal!</li>
    <li> Very efective, helped a lot to hidrate. I really recommend the use of this type of product as often as posible</li>
    <li> i got this because I love Cetaphil gentle cleanser and love bar soap so I was hoping this would be nirvana. I normally use dove sensitive bar soap and I felt like this was more drying that that. I&#x27;ll go back to using that. My bf likes to use this to wash his beard though so it&#x27;s not a total aaste</li>
    <li> I use the liquid to wash my face at night and use the bar in the shower in the morning.</li>
    <li> GREAT SOAP -- GOOD SUDS -- SKIN FEELS GREAT!!!</li>

    <li> This is a little $$$ but it works well for me and my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil is a very good product to use especailly if you have a skin problem. I have been using all of Cetaphil products for years that is why I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I order this for my husband. He has sensitive skin and stuggles with psoriasis. He doesn&#x27;t like body wash so was glad to find a bar that won&#x27;t aggravate his skin.</li>
    <li> I have a delicate skin and this is all I use.</li>
    <li> I have been using Cetaphil products for 8 years. I am 80 years old and using the soaps and creams have kept my skin smooth and unwrinkled.</li>
    <li> Love this soap.  I use it on my face and body and even on my cats and dog. Super gentle and smells clean.</li>
    <li> Works very well for my delicate skin</li>
