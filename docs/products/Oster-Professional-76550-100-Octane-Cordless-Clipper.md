      <li>They perform best if you clean them thoroughly with cool care, allow to dry completely and then oiled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Octane is lighter, more comfortable, more powerful, and lasts conservatively twice as long as the BGR+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>I accidentally ordered two, which actually seemed like a good thing when the first one did not work.</li>
      <li>just right for me,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>you turn it on and run it WITHOUT A BLADE ON THE CLIPPER until it dies and then Place it on the charger for your first charge...</li>
      <li>Just make sure the blades are brushed cleaned and oiled.</li>

      <li>but it charges back quick!</li>
      <li>It has a very high blade speed, which I really like.</li>
      <li>The clipper itself is sealed just brush excess hair at the end of each haircut and you&#x27;re ready cut.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not as much power</li>

      <li>am a professional barber and this clipper impress me very much.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It uses titan and classic 76 blades and Andis Ceramic and ultra edge blades...</li>
      <li>the battery is pretty much always at full charge, although have started to let it run down without charging.</li>
      <li>Does it have the brute force torque of the classic 76er, not really, at least to me it doesn&#x27;t seem to.</li>
      <li>$ per.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my new octane today and have been using it all day</li>
      <li>no need to purchase new blades or guides.  </li>
      <li>and they said send them back because the light should turn red when they are placed in the charger and they would not..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the exact same unit as the Heiniger Saphir made in Switzerland.</li>
      <li>I left it running intentionally to kill the battery the first time</li>
      <li>But wow holds the charge for awhile  </li>
      <li>cause my clients had to go thru the loud model 10</li>
      <li>recently bought a model 10 and now feel crappy for trying to use it for that whole day</li>
      <li>Tried charging them but the light stays green meaning they&#x27;re fully charged?</li>
      <li>Hoping to get it fixed and then maybe I can write an updated review.</li>
      <li>All the standard classic 76 accessories work with this unit, so</li>
      <li>I have been a loyal Andis BGR+ User for the past three of four years...</li>
      <li>blades are a bit slow but they&#x27;re strong and sharp.</li>

<li> few things that are noteworthy about the clipper that I feel customer service is lacking in knowledge on after talking with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> It&#x27;s like the battery is dead already!</li>
<li> /&gt;It comes with 1 ion battery, a 000 and 1 blade, blade oil, and the standard cheesy cleaning brush that no barber ever uses anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> /&gt;Conversely place a blade on the hinge and turn the clipper ON before snapping the blade into cutting</li>

    <li> Seemed pretty good, but they didn&#x27;t even turn on!! Refund!!!</li>
    <li> Stays charged for days!</li>
    <li> The Oster Octane is high quality..., verry nice clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are a bit slow but they&#x27;re strong and sharp. No hair pulling, it cuts everything in one motion. It&#x27;s made this way to reduce heat and prolong battery life. It&#x27;s the exact same unit as the Heiniger Saphir made in Switzerland. I don&#x27;t know the detail but they just call it an Oster Octane and the warranty by Oster is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find everything you need in one place.&lt;br /&gt;The Oster Octane Clipper itself, I got that at www.amazon.ca.&lt;br /&gt;The Andis Comb Attachment #66345 and #66320 with one Magnet they are the perfect fit for it, I got that at www.eBay.com.&lt;br /&gt;An extra Lithium ion Battery, I got that at www.Goodmans.net.</li>
    <li> The battery life is very impressive. It just seems to stay charged, I rotate it with an adjustable clipper so its used about 2-5 minutes a haircut, but do 20-25 cuts a day, With the amount I use it the battery is pretty much always at full charge, although have started to let it run down without charging. I think it could go all day without a charge but don&#x27;t want to risk a dead clipper. It has a very high blade speed, which I really like. It is expensive, and I felt like I was taking a chance buying it since most battery clippers I&#x27;ve used sucked and I don&#x27;t know anyone who owns the octane. I don&#x27;t regret buying it. Does it have the brute force torque of the classic 76er, not really, at least to me it doesn&#x27;t seem to. But it is powerful and the fast blade speed makes up for it.</li>
    <li> Really light compared to the 76 and model 10. But wow holds the charge for awhile  I work from 10 am to 9pm and I use it for every cut I start. If u don&#x27;t ever sit it back on the charger then things might get tuff for you once it dies instantly but it charges back quick! Best investment  I made I jus recently bought a model 10 and now feel crappy for trying to use it for that whole day cause my clients had to go thru the loud model 10 lol</li>
    <li> I just bought it and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Will see how it will work in a few month.&lt;br /&gt;I am a professional barber and this clipper impress me very much.</li>
    <li> I love this clipper!!! So far it&#x27;s the best cordless clipper I&#x27;ve ever used!  Update: 1/5/2016...idk what happened but it&#x27;s been 5 months and the clipper just stopped working. It&#x27;s like the battery is dead already! HELP!!!!</li>
    <li> Just received these today and they wont even turn on. Tried charging them but the light stays green meaning they&#x27;re fully charged? Going to call the company but I&#x27;m already disappointed. Hoping to get it fixed and then maybe I can write an updated review.</li>
    <li> I love this clipper very much the multi voltage (110 and 220)and tow plaids came with it (000 and 1) just right for me,&lt;br /&gt;I wish they add universal AC adapter</li>
    <li> Excellent machine .I&#x27;ve been a barber 14 years and this is  my new favorite</li>
    <li> Good quality, smooth and quit.&lt;br /&gt;Strong&lt;br /&gt;needs combs&lt;br /&gt;needs more blades&lt;br /&gt;needs extra battery&lt;br /&gt;overall I like it&lt;br /&gt;will recommend</li>
    <li> I accidentally ordered two, which actually seemed like a good thing when the first one did not work. Then to my chagrin the second one didn&#x27;t work either!! I called Oster thinking maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong and they said send them back because the light should turn red when they are placed in the charger and they would not.. hopefully I can get some that work. I have tested them at a trade show and was impressed with the overall performance, however, this experience has me wondering about the quality control and durability of this product.</li>
    <li> This clipper meets or exceeds all the benefits of the corded Oster clippers.  All the standard classic 76 accessories work with this unit, so no need to purchase new blades or guides.  The battery life is extremely long.  I left it running intentionally to kill the battery the first time and it was running strong after being on for over an hour.  Great technology.</li>
    <li> GOT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER WHO IS A BARBER...SHE WAS OVER THE MOON...SHE READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS AND THEN HAD TO TELL US ALL ABOUT IT.  YOU WOULD OF THOUGHT I GAVE HER A 65 MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a barber for over 15 years and this is one of the best investments I&#x27;ve made 5 stars once you get the extra battery you&#x27;re in the game all the rest of your clippers become backup clippers</li>
    <li> My husband loves this clipper.  Quite and holds a long charge!</li>
    <li> I have been a loyal Andis BGR+ User for the past three of four years...great clipper with one big problem the battery....I had to routinely buy a new one at least twice a year at 60$ per.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my new octane today and have been using it all day and it meets or exceeds my expectations in every area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power is great and steady there is no &amp;#34;winding down&amp;#34; of power as the clipper is used throughout the day. Once it is out of power it turns off although I&#x27;ve never come close to running it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging station has a slot for an optional extra battery but again I haven&#x27;t come close to needing an extra  and I cut all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The station charges one at a time...not a big deal once the clipper is fully charged your optional extra battery will be charged up and ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things that are noteworthy about the clipper that I feel customer service is lacking in knowledge on after talking with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It uses titan and classic 76 blades and Andis Ceramic and ultra edge blades...they are all interchangeable and work perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you receive the clipper you turn it on and run it WITHOUT A BLADE ON THE CLIPPER until it dies and then Place it on the charger for your first charge... doing so maximizes your batteries long term health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This only needs to be performed one time. And it will take at least 5 complete charges to get the maximum battery life out of the ion battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detachable basics: Turn the clipper OFF before depressing the blade release button and removing a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conversely place a blade on the hinge and turn the clipper ON before snapping the blade into cutting position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with 1 ion battery, a 000 and 1 blade, blade oil, and the standard cheesy cleaning brush that no barber ever uses anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing of note about any new blades they are usually coated with a residue to resist rust and moisture in warehouses until sold.
