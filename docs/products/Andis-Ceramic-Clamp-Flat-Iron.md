      <li>If your hair is very fine you might want to add another all-over misting (I liked the Garnier for this best because it&#x27;s a lighter mist/doesn&#x27;t overdo it)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very pleased with this item. Really a fantastic buy for the price. It heats quickly and makes my hair look shiny and healthy. It doesn&#x27;t tug on my hair and doesn&#x27;t get tangled in it. I have shoulder length hair that tends to be frizzy and I get a smooth look all day.</li>
    <li> Breaks my hair so bad...then it stopped working within a week.</li>
    <li> Really good flat iron! It actually exceeded my expectations!&lt;br /&gt;~One Happy Customer~</li>
    <li> Does not get hot enough</li>
    <li> It heats quickly, and maintains heat, but it does not hold my fine hair...it&#x27;s like the clamp isn&#x27;t tight enough, or it doesn&#x27;t close tightly on my hair.</li>
    <li> For the price you pay, it&#x27;s a decent hair straightener. I used it today and after biking, my hair was still fairly straight, but it lost some of the straightness from when I first straightened it. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker so I&#x27;d suggest some hairspray (I didn&#x27;t use any). My hair is medium thick, but I&#x27;m sure if I turned up the heat a bit more, it&#x27;d work better. For the price though, I&#x27;m happy with this. It works like it&#x27;s supposed to and for those with hair that&#x27;s a little harder to deal with, hairspray will make it all good.</li>
    <li> this ceramic flat iron works perfectly! I bought it as a gift for a friend and he loves it! The price is not to be beat &amp; it arrived in time for Christmas on short order time!</li>
    <li> i dont have alot of money to spend on just a flat iron alone so when i saw this i didint even check the reviews i just bought it lol i was desperate what can i say:P but um i have noticed after using it for 3 months it has broken alot of my hair off and it doesint work well at all on wet hair as u have to usually wait five ten mins for it to reheat up again and sumtimes even while im using it it quits reheating up even when my hair is not wet the upside about this iron is it eventually cools down if ur not using it instead of staying hott which is nice if u forget to unplug it or sumthing i wouldint recomment TESTING it as in that would be very stupid ha i just realized that when i was putting on my makeup and i had to set the iron down for about 10 mins i have tried the really expensive nice hott irons curly hair runs in my family and my cousens have the realllly expensive 100 200 dollar hair straigheners and if u have the money i would just go ahead and buy those its wayyyyyyyyy better in comparison to this it makes this iron seem like crap hah..anywyz i kinda wish i would have spent more money on a better hair straighener but oh well..than i would have been BROKE lol so yaa...ok well hope i helped later</li>
    <li> I love how I can use this flat iron when it&#x27;s only turned up to like 7. I have very thick hair and most flat irons require me to turn it all the way up. Plus I stopped getting perms, so now my hair is like a fro, until I lay this bad boy on it lol. I got the 1.5 inch, and I just ordered the 1 inch :P</li>
    <li> This was my first flat iron purchase and I wasn&#x27;t looking to invest a ton of money in it because I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would work with hair.   LOVE IT!  By far the fastest, easiest and most versatile styling tool I own.  I have fine hair currently cut as a bob and was worried that a flat iron would rob it of its volume, but I&#x27;ve discovered that using it, I can get the same look as I do with the blow dryer and round brush, but much faster and without the flyaways.  It&#x27;s great for styling after a blow dry as well as touch-ups for those couple of spots that always want to do their own thing. And since I picked it up at around $15, it was well worth every penny.  I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 months, so I can&#x27;t speak to long-term durability, but at the moment, I&#x27;m highly satisfied.</li>
    <li> IF U HAVE THICK LONG /SHORT HARD TO STRAIGHTEN HAIR BUY THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE THE HEAT WILL HAVE IT STRAIGHT AND VERY MANAGEABLE ,IM A QUALITY BARGAIN SHOPPER AND THIS WAS A GREAT FIND.BE SURE TO MOISTURIZE HAIR FIRST BECAUSE THESE GET HOTTT,FAST</li>
    <li> I found 15 dollars to be a steal of a deal. Works just as well as the higher priced competitors. I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I like this flat iron. The only thing I would say is that it takes a little longer than I&#x27;d like to straighten my bangs. I think that&#x27;s cuz of the bigger size of the 1.5 inch plates. Still like it though. It gets really hot.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron for THICK hair, does a great job! would buy another one!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the fast delivery and mint condition!</li>
    <li> I used it right away when i received my package, and it is really the flat iron of my dreams!!!! it makes my hair glossy and shiny and VERY soft!!!! I was going to buy a CHI but i bought this one instead, and its works FABULOUS!!!!! I love everything about it, it&#x27;s exactly what i wanted in a flat iron!!! Dont think twice about buying it just buy it trust me u wont regret it!! I&#x27;m a VERY picky person when it comes to my hair but i adore this!!</li>
    <li> I am VERY happy with this product! This is the first flat iron I have ever bought, and it worked FAR better than I had expected! It heats up VERY fast, has easy-to-use buttons and controls, and is VERY simple. It can make my hair pin straight in no time at all, it makes my hair feel soft, and it stays that way all day, and usually longer!    I love this, it is an AMAZING product. DEFINITELY worth the money!</li>
    <li> I should have been using a 1-1/2&amp;#34; flat iron a while ago. Just tried it - very pleased with the results - no snagging and no burning smell - just smooth and shiny hair! FYI, my hair is very thick, very coarse,shoulder-length (4c).</li>
    <li> I bought this item and was only able to use it once before it stop heating... worst purchase ever... Worth no stars</li>
    <li> i was a little scared to buy it because it was really cheap and i didnt think it wud be good quality, but i love it.</li>
    <li> I like this because it was pretty inexpensive and does a fairly good job.  I have pretty straight hair to begin with so I didn&#x27;t need a serious straightener; just something to calm my hair down when it was doing something I didn&#x27;t like.  One thing that bothers me is that every once in a while, my hair will get caught between the ceramic plate and the plastic and it pulls my hair out.  OUCH!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get as hot but I&#x27;ll keep it!</li>
    <li> I just love this product. For me, it has deleted my use for the traditional curling iron. It doesn&#x27;t take long to heat up or cool off!</li>
    <li> I open the box and i see how odly liitle it is then i was picturing. I undertand the hight is givin and that i didnt pay much attention. Yet it was verry dissapointing. ALso i do like how it has a grip spot on the iron part to place your fingers on, was verry convinant. I would have to say that its OK not the best but it will get you through.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is nothing to rave about.  Yes, it works fairly well and is worth the low price.  Just file it under.....\\&quot;You get what you pay for.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I bought this b/c I needed a 1.5 inch flat iron and I figured this would be a good one to try out. I was totally blown away by the results! I first used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair and it worked wonderful. I&#x27;m African American w/ type 4a/4b (very thick) hair. This even worked well on me. The only downside is that it does tend to snag the hair but I figure if I just watch how much hair I section off it will be fine later. This worked almost as well as my higher end flat iron and I can truly say that this is a great flat iron to own. So if you are looking for a good iron w/o having to spend the higher end money, GO FOR IT!</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightener. It has 20 heat settings, is the perfect width, and even has a locking mechanism which a lot of other ones don&#x27;t have. I love all Andis straighteners and this is my 2nd one in the past 5 years. They last a long time and are smooth. I love it!</li>
    <li> It Works Great, nice and small for on the go. Heats quickly. Easy to Use. Guaranteed to give Satisfying results.</li>
    <li> It works great on my hair and I would recommend it to anyone! Love how it straitens my hair. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I love these andis ceramic&#x27;s. They are the best ceramic I have ever owned and I have owned ceramic&#x27;s in almost all sizes. These andis heat up fast and create curls I couldn&#x27;t get right with other ceramic&#x27;s. I have told all my girlfriends to buy a pair especially the ones with curly hair. Your hair stays straight for days without losing a curl.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it at all-it makes my hair dull, dry and fuzzy. I am really disappointed. My mistake was that I assumed that a flat iron could not possibly do a bad job and the price and brand dont matter, but obviously I was wrong. It&#x27;s worth its price. I didnt return it, because shipping is almost half the price of the flat iron.</li>
    <li> THE PLATES DONT HEAT UP!  I dont live in US or Canada, how am i supposed to return this?!</li>
    <li> I bought this for less than $20 because I left my regular one at my in-laws&#x27; house over the holidays and needed something until I saw them again.  I figured I could just keep this one in my travel bag and have it handy, but after using it just one time, I may use this on a regular basis and put the other one in my travel bag.  Seriously, I paid under $20 for this straightener, yet it performs better than ones that cost hundreds of dollars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, coarse,frizzy hair, but this iron straightened it out in minutes.  Now my hair is shiny, straight, and silky.  Now I am thankful for my forgetfulness!!!!</li>
    <li> After years of perms on my hair I wanted it to be straight again. I have thin hair but to style my hair isn&#x27;t easy(especially if there&#x27;s humidity). Since I&#x27;m on a budget,I read some reviews and bought this one at a good price. I like the swivel cord, it&#x27;s long too, I like the lock it has to close it when not using it, and it heats up pretty fast. I am impatient when it comes to my hair but using this makes it easy for me. After blowdrying my hair I put a little bit of Redken outshine 01, spray a little TreSemme heat tamer, and start sectioning my hair to straighten it. I rated it four stars because my friend had a  1\\&quot; flat iron from HAI that I loved but couldn&#x27;t afford it so this one is close enough!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t complain how this flat iron performs when it comes to making my hair look shinier and somewhat straight (not pin straight). For the price it&#x27;s a great deal and I suppose that it works as good as $100+ flat irons if not better. I love how it has multiple heat settings but my favourite feature is the auto shut off. I freaked out when I left my other flat iron plugged in so I vowed to myself to never get one which does not come with auto shut off feature. It heats up rather quickly, love the swivel cord too. Here goes the part that I hate the most and the reason why I only give it 3 stars despite the Pros that I mentioned.... IT PULLS MY HAIR!!!! Arrrgggghhhh! It&#x27;s so frustrating especially if you are in a hurry. It snags some of my hair and boy I can see the snagged hair on the end plate. If I keep using this flat iron, I swear I&#x27;ll have split ends! I don&#x27;t know why the company decided to design this flat iron that way, like there&#x27;s a tiny space in between the plate and the body/black part (whatever you call it). I would not recommend this flat iron. Maybe if you have the time to straighten your hair carefully for one hour then that will do the trick. Don&#x27;t let your hair reach that thing at the end or you will see 2 or 3 pieces of snagged hair each time you will straighten a section!</li>
    <li> I had the 1inch one for over 5 years which was almost identical to this one but it fell and cracked so I bought this one to replace it. However it&#x27;s not nearly as good. It take really long to heat up at a high temp setting and I don&#x27;t even think it gets as hot as the one I had before, maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I doubt it. Disappointed...cause I loved my other one so much, was so sad when it broke. I will prob keep this as a back up, but will definitely be buying another flat iron soon.</li>
    <li> I had this flat iron already and I love it. It heats up quickly and did a great job straighten my hair. Someone actually asked it I&#x27;d gotten it done at a salon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a few flat irons in my past and this one I would rate higher on the scale compared to some I had. I used it not expecting fantastic results because it has mixed reviews. I guess it all depends on the hair type. I have very very thick wavy hair so I can&#x27;t really judge it on the time it took to straighten my hair because there&#x27;s no flat iron out there that would straight all my hair in 5 min! I will say most of my hair I only had to pass over with the iron once and it was straight. There was some pieces I had to go over a few times but I think that&#x27;s just because my hair is very stubborn! I&#x27;ve never paid over $50 or $60 for a flat iron so I can&#x27;t really compare this to like the CHI for example. I did have the GVP flat iron and like it a lot &amp; had it probably the longest out of all my irons but it got dropped one too many times. I had one after that which I got from Sally Beauty Supply called the \\&quot;Ion Color Brilliance\\&quot; and it was pretty good also but I had to go over the same spot several times to straighten my hair. So if you&#x27;re not wanting to spend a butt load I would definitely recommend this iron! I found it at Wal-Mart but if it wasn&#x27;t there I would have got it on Amazon because I freakin&#x27; love this website! I&#x27;ve bought so many things on here because they have such good prices!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001BODO5C Andis 67770 1-1/2\\&quot; High Heat Multi-Temp Ceramic Flat Iron]]  Love it.  It works great, has varied settings and I would recommend it.........</li>
    <li> Works extremely well for the price. It has caught my hair and broken it off a few times though</li>
    <li> Stopped working after two months</li>
    <li> I Like the operation buttons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It has a little wheel that goes from 1-20 to control the heat and an on an off switch (as well as a green on red light to let you know if its on or off). I always have to put my hair up for work, and needed something to straighten the kinks and curls I get from wearing it down. Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> It amazes me how much better this flat iron performs than those $100 salon irons.  No one should buy a flat iron that doesn&#x27;t have a temperature control.  People with thin hair don&#x27;t need the kind of heat that people with coarse or really curly hair need.  You use too high of a temp, and you&#x27;re costing yourself split ends, which is extra money on hair treatments and haircuts.  This iron has that temp adjustment.  Not only that, but it has a little clasp near the cord that will hold it closed during storage - something my Revlon iron never had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my experience so far, it heats up quickly and the temp remains consistent.  An added bonus is the little green light that lets you know when it&#x27;s reached proper temp.  Note, though, that it does not heat up in 30 seconds as claimed.  It may heat up to a heat setting of 2 or 3 in that time, but I use a heat setting of 10 for my hair, and it take about a minute and a half.  (Still lightening quick IMO.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $14 for this, and it would be a good deal at twice the price.</li>
    <li> This is the first flat iron I have ever used.  I liked the temperature setting and the fact that it has an automatic shut-off feature in case I forget to turn it off.  It works fine for my thick, wavy hair.  I am pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> i had bought this straigtner at a store before and loved it. so after like 2yrs i thought i needed a new one so i bought it here. But after like 3 months it died nd stopped working!!&lt;br /&gt;-___-</li>
    <li> Love it! It is exactly as described</li>
    <li> works very well, I have thick coarse kinky afro hair no perm I,m natural and my hair looked permed and shiny great flatiron and multiple temps works great</li>
    <li> Lo compre como regalo para mi esposa y le encanto. Es potente, rápido y no daña el cabello. Lo recomiendo.</li>
    <li> It works very well it heats up extremely fast and the only problem with it is it tugs on my hair a bit.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, but the outer surface is very hot and is not covered    Coating to protect the hands from the heat, but generally very good</li>
    <li> Surprisingly good value.  Easy to operate straight out of the box.  This is my first flat iron.  I just wanted to try it but now I really love it and am no longer afraid of flat irons.   Now know that Andis is a respected beauty salon brand, even though I use mine at home</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 16 year old daughter who is super picky and she loves it!!  That tells it all. It is a great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Love this hair iron. If your looking for one that&#x27;s cheap and guarantees good results pick this one!!!</li>
    <li> All the girls in my family use these. And we all live together so we all use the same one. After a couple of years, our first one broke and stopped getting as hot as it used to on the different settings we all used. So we decided to find out what one cost on Amazon and it was fairly cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works really well.</li>
    <li> PERFECTION at a great price. Performs as well, or better, than much higher-priced irons. Originally purchased as my &amp;#34;fill-in,&amp;#34; it now serves as my &amp;#34;primary&amp;#34; iron!</li>
    <li> After a month of using this product it no longer heats up and i&#x27;m very disappointed, because it was a great product when it was working. I don&#x27;t know who to speak to on getting it replaces, because I have only used it twice and would like to have continue using it!</li>
    <li> Hi guys! Well, my sister warned me but I was in need of a cheap flat iron and needed it quick. So, it straightens well of course your first time, but then the ceramic starts to peel as if it was just a \\&quot;coat\\&quot; of it instead of fully ceramic which if you have natural hair like me it wouldnt be a good thing because it damages your hair, but of course if you&#x27;re just looking for something quick then this is the way to go!</li>
    <li> I have had this straightener for almost 3 years, maybe 4, and it works great. It&#x27;s just now to the point I&#x27;m getting a replacement, but it works great. It leaves your hair straight, soft, and smooth. :)</li>
    <li> I like this. It&#x27;s easy to use and won&#x27;t make your hair go to flat, just enough to look good but still have a natural overall look.. it heats up pretty fast which has advantages cause you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to use it but also be careful kinda burnt my finger a week ago due to a little mishandle..  But i would definitely recommend it especially for it&#x27;s price!</li>
    <li> It is not so useful, I bought it on March, but I don&#x27;t use it frequently. Guess what, it is broken, I have no idea how it is broken because I remember I used it on Tuesday, but today, two days later, it doesn&#x27;t work. I wonder why or how can I fix it? Can I return it? haha</li>
    <li> This item is perfect!!! Heats up greatly and works like it&#x27;s worth a Million Bucks! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> i thought the product had a voltage range but its just for local use..when i used it in INDIA it burnt due to voltage of 240v.but otherwise a great product for the price.</li>
    <li> This heats up in 30 seconds, just like it claims. I have thin shoulder length hair and have the heat setting on 5 (out o 20) and it works well for me. I can curl the ends under easily. I even use it on my bangs. I wasn&#x27;t sure about this width at first, but now I&#x27;m glad I got it versus the 1&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Catches and pulls your hair. I only bought because i wanted a wider one but i wish it wouldnt pull my hair as i try ro use it</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron for women with natural hair. I&#x27;m trying to switch from relaxer to natural but I love my hair straight. This is a great product for a woman who wants that straight look but don&#x27;t have the budget for a high price salon flat iron.</li>
    <li> Hair goes from frizzy to straight, and does better the more strands are run through the iron. Works even better with a little straightening product.&lt;br /&gt;Does not have an auto-off, which is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Broke very quickly and doesnt straighten hair like it says it&#x27;s going to. It&#x27;s horrible and just threw it away. It&#x27;s a piece if garbage.</li>
    <li> My mom got one of of these from Dirt Cheap &amp; we thought it was going to be a horrible $4 investment. Actually it was the best $4 she has spent so I ordered me one &amp; I can&#x27;t wait to use it!</li>
    <li> this flat iron is really good but youe need to make sure that you clean it if you don&#x27;t then the flat iron is going to turn black and you do not want that you can clean it when it is hot on low like 1-5 degrees or when it is cool but over all htis is a great flat iron for real it is also a really good deal for this flat iron</li>
    <li> This was the first flat iron I tried (besides the ones in the salons), and I am very happy with it. Overall great purchase.</li>
    <li> I recieved my flat iron today and i opened to immediately used it. Its awesome  recently became a hair product freak. I originally brought another iron but the more I became i guru on hair and weave i had to upgrade. I love the multi heat setting its works well on my natural hair and also my extensions. Its a must have if you dont the money for a chi. I suggest buying it with the 1inch as well and also use chi products and you good to go</li>
    <li> This flat iron is the perfect size for at home and travel use.  I think it works as good as the pricey flat irons!</li>
    <li> OMG if I would have know a flat iron like this was out there I would have purchased it years ago.   The last flat iron I tired was back in 93 and it was horrible.  This heats up fast and works great!</li>
    <li> Where I get my hair cut they use Andis straighteners.  The girls there told me they prefer them over the Chi.  I have tried several different products, but this on is by far the best!  I love that it gets really hot, that it is lightweight, and that it never pulls my hair, which is what causes the split ends.</li>
    <li> Great for curls that last ALL DAY, no hairspray needed. So inexpensive, my price was $14.77 total, including s+h. Was thinking of getting high end CHI, GHD, KQC, ISO, Babyliss but read the rave reviews &amp; decided to try. I&#x27;m glad i did. U should try it,u&#x27;ll love it &amp; the low price makes u feel like a smart shopper. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this.  Works great, nice that the temp is adjustable.</li>
    <li> After my old Andis Ceramic Flat Iron quit heating up, I went ahead and ordered another one off of here, because I could not find one in Wal-mart (which is where I bought the last 2 Andis straighteners I had). Not only did it come in on the expected delivery date, but after using it, I&#x27;m glad I went ahead and ordered a new one. I love this straightener because it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair, and I don&#x27;t have to have the hear settings set very high for it to actually straighten my really thick hair. And, you can beat getting a great straightener for such a great price!</li>
    <li> good flat iron! Had it for a few months now it doesn&#x27;t feel very sturdy. But it is still holding on!</li>
    <li> This flat iron works great!!! I didn&#x27;t expect it to work so well considering how cheap it was but I was completely wrong! Heats up quick and does not pull my hair at all.</li>
    <li> I first bought this flat-iron about 5 years ago at WalMart - basically because I wanted a straightener (I had never owned one before this) and this one was $15.00, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I have used it almost every single day since I&#x27;ve had it, and only in the past 6 months or so has it started to wear out. The ceramic coating is starting to wear from the plates, and it does not heat as well as it used to. Since it started to wear, I have bought 3 other flat-irons to replace my Andis (for some reason, I just cannot find another Andis in any store anymore!) and all 3 of those irons has gone right into the drawer, never to be used after the first 1 or 2 uses. I just cannot find one that I like nearly as much as my Andis! I am ordering a replacement here today. Why didn&#x27;t I think of coming here sooner to get another one??</li>
    <li> I am sure the product is a good product, but it is to large and balky for me to use. I will probably use as a gift.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical in buying this flat iron as I have been trying for years to find one that worked for my hair. Well I am here to tell you that this Flat Iron is everything the product description says it is. It heats very quickly, does a wonderful job that lasts well through the day and beyond. I have very thick and randomly wavy hair, I can go from bedhead to ready to walk out the door in less the 10 minutes. It just depends on how much of my hair I want to do. I highly recommend this product especially for the price!</li>
    <li> I faced some problem with the one I&#x27;d ordered first, so I returned it and Amazon promptly sent me a replacement. It works really well and straightens your hair perfectly. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Think I&#x27;m going to love these</li>
    <li> I have very thick coarse wavy hair. It is really a challenge to get any shine into this hair. and frizzies are a constant problem. I normally allow to air dry with a product to keep the frizz under control. I have always been envious of people with smooth hair and this product got me there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up very quickly, I don&#x27;t even have to turn it on until I am done blow drying. In a few minutes it&#x27;s ready to go. I don&#x27;t have to go over and over each section to get it smooth, it&#x27;s one pass and I can move on. It takes about 10 minutes to do my whole head, and I have loads of shoulder length hair (think Gilda Radner)., I do find it helps to clip up the top section so I can easily get to the underside and sides, then finish the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really have no complaints, a great bargain and top performance!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and it sounded like a great product. It was great until a week ago when I noticed it was not getting very hot even on highest setting and now its luke warm at best so its worthless. I&#x27;ve had it since February so it lasted approx 5  months. I can&#x27;t return it as my return date has expired so I decided to review it and warn others that it works great but dies out early .. Unless mine is an exception but I won&#x27;t know since I can&#x27;t replace it and I&#x27;m not willing to buy another to find out.</li>
    <li> The ONLY straighterner that works on my curly, thick and frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s really good it&#x27;s fast and easy and safe it just works perfectly I can straighten my hair In 5-10 minuets</li>
    <li> I have purchased this iron before two other times and I just had to buy another after 8 years of owning it. When I received this one it worked once...then never heated up again.</li>
    <li> Works great. it is not too bulky. I like the varying temp settings and it opens wide enough to use easily.  Delivery was quick. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I actually use this hair straightener to quickly iron my shirt&#x27;s collars, cuffs, seams, etc.</li>
    <li> I love it. Ten times better than the flat iron I have which is sad since I paid so much more for that one. Would get another one when mine gives out. :)</li>
    <li> Good price, heats up fast, but it pulls my hair out every morning. I&#x27;d be bald if I kept using it. Maybe it&#x27;s because I have fine/thin hair and it fits in between the heating element and the unit, but I can&#x27;t use this anymore.</li>
    <li> I used this flat iron one time. And in that one time, it started off great, but the longer I used it, the cooler it became. I had to unplug it and plug it back in in order for it to get hot again. Great things Amazon has a fantastic return policy.</li>
    <li> leaves marks in your hair as it goes through, cheap, not worth it, spend more.</li>
    <li> I ordered this EXACT same flat iron size and brand 4 years ago from Walmart and it lasted over 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;Then I purchased this same one on Amazon and it lasts 4 months..then just died:(&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t heat up to the slightest. No light came on nothing..just died&lt;br /&gt;Been nice to get a refund. I DO NOT recommend this product bought off of here.&lt;br /&gt;But highly recommend purchasing it from Walmart.com</li>
    <li> Great been looking for this brand for awhile!</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife to replace a previous purchase of a 1\\&quot; Flat Iron, her hair has grown longer and this wider version makes it easier for her to flatten her hair. She has been using it nearly every day in the past 8 months, it has been reliable and is holding up well. We shopped around and found this had the best reputation and the price was fair and a value.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Lasts a long time.  Works well.</li>
    <li> It heats up quickly, it has high temperature and straightens hair quite well. Very convenient width too</li>
    <li> Love this! I have thick long hair and it was so quick and easy to straighten.  It is perfect width for thick hair. I used it when my hair was downy back and I recently cut it to just abovey shoulders. It is perfect</li>
    <li> I WAS LOOKING TO REPLACE MY OLD ONE BUT I REALIZED MINES MAY BE 2&#x27;&#x27; OR 3&#x27;&#x27;. BUT THIS ONE IS FINE EASY FOR ME TO CURL MY BANGS.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas to replace hers that broke. I was nervous about buying this because it was so cheap for a flat iron. She loves this thing and was shocked at how well it works for it being so cheap.</li>
    <li> PROS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this will straighten your hair&lt;br /&gt;heats to 450 degrees&lt;br /&gt;really grabs onto thick hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;heats to 450 degrees -- this will damage ANY hair&lt;br /&gt;temperature dial is tiny, hard to see &amp; easy to bump&lt;br /&gt;no floating plates, pulls on fine hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all -- this WILL straighten your hair.  So it does it&#x27;s job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it would be good for thick, curly hair but I have fine hair and should have read reviews more carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest problem with this iron is that it gets so HOT.  Sounds crazy, but my stylist said you should NEVER use an iron at 450 degrees unless you&#x27;re doing a keratin treatment.  If you&#x27;re doing that, you&#x27;re probably  going to have a professional iron, not one in this price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heat setting dial is very small and hard to read -- so it would be easy to bump it and singe your hair off by accident.  There are warnings all over the iron and directions.  If you buy this, check the heat setting every time before you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a bit \\&quot;grabby.\\&quot;  I have fine hair that comes out easily.  The plates on this aren&#x27;t floating or smooth like my last iron, so they pull.  While that&#x27;s good for thick hair, it pulls on my fine hair and I loose more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m keeping it since it does straighten and it&#x27;s a pain to return, but I probably should have purchased a different one for my needs.</li>
    <li> they caught fire so had Replacement and second pair did the same they gave me a refund same as the style and shape looked nice</li>
    <li> EASY TO USE,YOU DON&#x27;T HAVE TO WAIT LONG TIME TO STAR USING IT,TI GET HOT FAST!HAVE A GREAT PRICE,DON&#x27;T THINK IT TWICE!</li>
    <li> Pretty good flat iron. Gets pretty hot but needs to be replaced about ever 6-9 months for someone who uses it on a everyday basis. The plates wear down visually. Which makes you worry and wounder if your frying your hair.</li>
    <li> I love the Andis multi temp flat iron, I have fine hair and if you do a quick swipe through your hair it wont leave a crease mark and straightens it fast once heated.  Thanks for the great price as well as product</li>
    <li> These are better then any flat irons I have ever had in a long time....&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve burnt myself twice but that was my own fault tho. Lol</li>
    <li> The blades of the iron are nice and smooth. My hair looks shiny and I have very little fly away strands. My only issue is the heat level is not as high as I would like it to be.</li>
    <li> Worked like a charm- my only issue was that my hair would get stuck under the ceramic plates and struggles ensued</li>
    <li> Great seller and product!! Product is as described. love the wider size. I have  a smaller (\\&quot;1\\&quot;) Andis flat iron and I love it as well.</li>
    <li> works fantastic very happy with the product I use it daily Great item and I hope it will last thank you</li>
    <li> Pretty terrible. It got hot relatively quickly, but the temperature wouldn&#x27;t stay consistent. The cheap ceramic coating didn&#x27;t even last through the first straightening. It was kind of straight at the end, but that didn&#x27;t even last 24 hours. My hair is a ball of frizz which has never been the case after straightening beforehand. I&#x27;ll pay more next time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really nice little flatiron for the money, but after only one month, mine has died. It does have an auto shut off, so I didn&#x27;t worry too much about forgetting if I had left it on or plugged in, so maybe that burned it out. If you love the iron, don&#x27;t leave it on. I have a curling iron with an auto shutoff and I&#x27;ve had it over a year now, and it has had it&#x27;s fair share of being left on (I have a stand for it that I love http://www.amazon.com/Hair-Art-Spiral-Curling-Stand/dp/B002RU18WK/ref&#x3D;sr_1_27?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1296933223&amp;sr&#x3D;1-27, shop around for the best price and shipping, I got mine for less than $20 total) and it&#x27;s still working great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flatiron works great, doesn&#x27;t snag your hair, and the adjustable heat setting is a must. I have fine hair, and learned (my first flatiron) that the highest heat is not for me, and I gave myself some mean split ends. I started using it at about 10, and it was working fine, and left my hair shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend using a hair product designed to be used with flatirons to protect your hair, especially if it&#x27;s fine. You&#x27;ll find it softer, shinier, and the risk of damage will be much less. DO NOT USE ON WET HAIR no matter what it says!</li>
    <li> I had bought the 1\\&quot; Andis for my daughter a while back and she loved it - good product, but the ceramic wore off after the constant use and she needed a replacement.  This time I thought maybe she could spend less time in the bathroom if I gave her the 1-1/2\\&quot; - my thinking worked - she loves it, says it is faster to use, and her thick wavy hair is pin straight.  Don&#x27;t let the price fool you, this is a great buy and you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin to medium hair that is mostly gray but colored.  I use this on my hair dry at setting 5 and it smooths my hair and takes away the dry, wiry look.  I always thought my hair was just damaged from coloring etc. My hairdresser suggested a flat iron and I picked this one based on other reviews.  While i can not speak to longevity as of yet, I will say that it heats fast, and even at a low setting of 5 provides exactly what I was looking for, my hair has shine to it again! An additional feature I really like is the locking button at the bottom. With a 3 and 5 year old it is nice to know that even when i turn it off, I can use that button to hold it almost closed while it cools making it near impossible for them to get hurt if they were happen to pull it off the counter.</li>
    <li> AWFUL!! It could not straighten my thin, fine hair at all. pulled my hair out very badly.</li>
    <li> Wow. This is the best flat iron ive owned. I noticed an immediate difference the first time I used it. My hair was silkier, straighter and smoother than it has ever been, it gets how really fast and the temperature settng ar ok you cant select the exact temperature setting 1 is always more than enough and it goes up to 20 which is equal to 400 degrees</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift and my friend loves it! She said it works just fine as her Chi that went out on her.</li>
    <li> Best hot iron I have ever had!!!!!</li>
    <li> I actually bought this as an experiment. I have a long beard and I wanted to see what it would look like straightened. Overall it seems to be a solid device, and although I ended up deciding that beard straightening is not the way to go, this is a decent and inexpensive device.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed using this  flat iron. It does well with my hair (fine). I like the size of it. The cord is also easy to maneuver. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This iron is great! Gives me the salon straight I have been looking for. I use this with the CHI thermal protection and it does a GREAT Job. I had the Revlon 1\\&quot; ones before this one and it didn&#x27;t do a good job like this one. I cannot afford the CHI irons so I took a chance and bought these from Walmart and yes I am satisfied. I say buy it and try for this price you cant lose!</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd one I&#x27;ve owned and love these straighteners. They are very hot, cheap and easy to use. The only downfall is that I use it almost daily and I would say each has lasted about a 2 years, when the ceramic coating began wearing off and created a funny burning smell. Amazon has the best price I&#x27;ve seen by far, great buy!</li>
    <li> smaller than o expected but I received what I ordered in excellent time</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this model in the past 5 years or so. I only had to replace my last one because I used it so much the ceramic started to wear off after many years. You can&#x27;t beat the quality for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also makes great flat-iron curls.</li>
    <li> I have a smaller one of these and wanted another one that was larger. This product works very well. Nice.</li>
    <li> Great product! Have purchased two so far!</li>
    <li> the first time i tried this i was like wow. works so well on my african american hair. i like the different heat setting. i will recommend this to everyone. it is really good. the best thing is that it doesn&#x27;t produce smoke like other flat irons.</li>
    <li> Great product, smooth transaction.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a really good flat iron..ive purchased other brands... but I like this one the most! !! It heats up real fast.. &amp; the price wasn&#x27;t bad!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered 1/2\\&quot; too wide and have burned myself, so be careful what you need! Other than that I like the fact that it heats up and cools down quickly, is easy to turn on and off. I&#x27;d like it more if the temperature control could click in place or be placed elsewhere since I kept rolling it by mistake. BUT, for the price - it&#x27;s a steal and worked great on my hair!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected gets hot too quick burns fingers but if ur hair can take heat well this is ur flatiron right here</li>
    <li> It heats up quickly and gets very hot. It straightens my hair very well. This is actually the second one I bought of this exact same model because my first one finally broke after dropping it sooo many times in the 6 years I have used the first one.</li>
    <li> Not good. It pulls my hair out every time I use it. Horrible.</li>
    <li> My hair is really thick and it straightened my hair it&#x27;s still a bit puffy but I just gotta straighten it 2 or3 more times and I&#x27;ll have the straights hair I have ever had no other flat iron has done this for my hair I love it</li>
    <li> Pretty decent flat iron. Gets super hot pretty fast, but also can be adjusted to a lower heat if needed. Could be better (I like a flat iron that doesn&#x27;t get too hot on the outside so that I can grip it on both sides while doing my hair) but, for the price, not bad. Not bad at all...</li>
    <li> this is a gift for my grand daughter she loves it so much I ordered one more for my other grand darghter</li>
    <li> I love this thing! I&#x27;m so impressed with the quality of the product, especially for the price. I have fine hair, so a low heat setting is necessary. It has several settings and works in a snap. It glides so smoothly over my hair and does a beautiful job. :)</li>
    <li> This straightener gets very hot and will tame even my naturally curly hair. For me it did not matter which size I ordered. The only thing that the size effected for me was the time it took me to straighten my hair. When fully heated it did produce steam and I smelled burnt hair so I would use some kind of protector on your hair. I also have a Conair straightener and this works much better!</li>
    <li> Since I don&#x27;t use it, I can only go by what others tell, or don&#x27;t tell, me.  Since I&#x27;ve heard nearly nothing, and I would have heard complaints, I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s working as needed.  When it was first used, I heard giggles at how much faster it heated up than the old one.</li>
    <li> Arrived in time for Christmas. Great product. Works really well and has the appropriate heat settings for my daughters type of hair. Added bonus was that it was reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected. After six months, still works just fine.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair, so I need all the power from my flat iron. This one worked perfectly for a few months, but now it loses heat midway through. If you don&#x27;t need intensive heat for your hair, then get it. If you need heavy duty heat and longevity, find another iron.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because my old one is an Andis flat iron and I liked it. But when I got this one it didn&#x27;t get hot enough and my old one was hottter.</li>
    <li> I love my purchase and I like the way flatirons have taken the place of hard pressing hair.  Mine is very convenient and I use it occasionally.</li>
    <li> When I first got this product, I immediately tried it out. It heats up quickly and does the job right to the point. I don&#x27;t have any problems with the flat iron and I&#x27;d definitely buy from here again.</li>
    <li> great product, looks great, execlent price gets the job done. great packaging. If you&#x27;re looking for a straightning iron this is the one to buy.</li>
    <li> With natural hair, the straight look is easy with Andis....Don&#x27;t ever discontinue this!!! I don&#x27;t know what I will do if it goes away!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother in law because she was always using her daughters who had the same exact one  I  bought her. She loves it and I bought it a couple years ago and still working. Received this item in a timely manner as promised and price was reasonable.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, as her&#x27;s had quit working.  She doesn&#x27;t like it and went out and bought another brand. She said it doesn&#x27;t glide through her hair and takes much longer to work than her old one or the one she replaced this with.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel it does a great job as i expected. Looking for another one.........doesn&#x27;t seem hot enough and hard to handle</li>
    <li> Brought it for my wife, she loves it. Price is right and she loves the auto off feature since she does tend to forget to turn it off when she&#x27;s in a rush.</li>
    <li> I see the previous negative review that I left over the summer has been deleted. Well I guess the season makes a diffference because as fried as this left my hair in the hot humid summer thats how silky smooth it leaves it now in the cold winter. It also helps that I&#x27;ve found a product that works well with heat tools. Its so annoying because I&#x27;ve used way more expensive products that had a better feel and texture while I slathered them on, but failed once the flatiron hit it. I have long, thick poodle curls that are well hydrated by moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. One pass does the trick. Two if I want extra flattening, which I like.</li>
    <li> Why would you guys send me a product that does not work. I cant believe this action of you guys.</li>
    <li> CAME ON TIME AND EARLY IT WORKS GOOD I LOVE IT !</li>
    <li> I love these flat irons, they are exactly what I expected!  So far, so good!  Love the automatic shut off!</li>
    <li> My old flat iron finally kicked the bucket.  I typically do exacting research on a product, seeking good quality for a great price, prompt delivery, and this ceramic flat iron fits the bill.  Heats up quickly, distributes evenly across the tiles, not so big that it takes up half of the bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is I ordered this item with another product to be delivered via SuperSaver, which is free, but you have to wait up to 7 business days to get it.  Usually, it delivered within that 7 day window. This time, however, Amazon took more than 7 days to just ship it.  I love Amazon; they are the best in customer service, but because they took so long, it seemed like they were trying to get me to upgrade my shipping.  Still, they are the best retailer for good quality for a great price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a Chi girl, but my most recent flat iron wasn&#x27;t of as good quality as my previous purchases. When it died after only 18 months, I decided not to buy another Chi. Happily, that very same day Amazon happened to have this flat iron on a lightning deal. I figured it was only $12, so I&#x27;d give it a shot before ordering a more expensive iron. I am so happy I did! It is such a good buy. Granted, it&#x27;s definitely an economy model, but it doesn&#x27;t pull or burn my hair, has decent heat controls, and heats up very quickly. The cord is a bit stiff and can get in the way, but other than that this is a great iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tons of fine, curly hair that is prone to frizzing. This iron smooths the cuticle very well and keeps me looking neat and put-together all day.</li>
    <li> Works great, and does heat up very quickly within a minute.  Also like the temperature settings and the lights on it.</li>
    <li> not the most perfect of flat irons, but it has served it&#x27;s purpose until i was able to buy a hot tools flat iron. -a stylist</li>
    <li> I use this flat iron daily, I will recommend this to anyone, though the price is very low the quality is beyond high.  Whenever the flat iron gets old I will purchase another one.</li>
    <li> Got it for my wife, the 1&amp;#34; as well, they&#x27;re pretty inexpensive so why not. They work as described. She&#x27;s happy.</li>
    <li> Just wish it got hotter</li>
    <li> As expected! Heats quickly. Love it!</li>
    <li> This works better than any flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used before. Leaves my hair very smooth, does not snag at all. It also heats up super fast and has a wide range of temperature settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because the cord is WAY too long. Maybe that&#x27;s b/c it&#x27;s meant to be used in a salon? I&#x27;m not sure, but it&#x27;s a little too much cord for my little bathroom at home. But it&#x27;s not a deal breaker. I still love this product!</li>
    <li> its the best. i thought i couldnt find one better than the one my sister had but i did this one is awesome</li>
    <li> Heats up very quickly and does a great job, even on my thick stubborn hair. I bought it on sale for around 10 bucks and it was a steal. Has held up very well.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t care much for it. Seems to &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34; through my hair.  Not my favorite of all time.</li>
    <li> this is a great ironer and my wife is pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really worth the price and amazon has got the best deal.</li>
    <li> I was a little concerned because I had never heard of this brand, but my daughter said this is exactly what she wanted.</li>
    <li> This is a great size, I have one bigger 2&amp;#34; (too big) and one smaller, 1&amp;#34;, which took longer to straighten my hair. This heats up quickly and you can determine how hot you want it. I have shortish hair and this works great, it takes less time to do my hair in the morning. So far, no problems.</li>
    <li> Bought for my girlfriend and she loves it. Great quality, fast shipping, great price. She has nothing bad to say about it.</li>
    <li> This was not a good choice. It never got as hot as the reviews and I had to go out and replace it. Word of advice... Don&#x27;t buy cheap.</li>
    <li> This flat iron did not work well on my hair. I have to go over my hair at least 3 times before it is straight but then it is frizzy I was would not recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> Have been using it about a week. Wider than the one it was replacing, so getting use to that...but otherwise, it has been a great purchase at a fantastic price.</li>
    <li> Works well - heats up quickly and keeps the heat.  Best thing about it is it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair.  Glides nicely and makes my hair straight and shiny.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my grown daughter and she loves it.  She says it&#x27;s the best one she&#x27;s ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has temperature controls, an on and off switch and comes with a cover you can put it in while it&#x27;s still hot so you can put it away without worrying it will melt whatever it touches.  It heats up fast and has an auto shut-off feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a very good price as well.  You really don&#x27;t have to do further searching.  If you buy this, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Just as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Works wonderful.</li>
    <li> Hoping that I receive a replacement, because my flat irons gets hot on one side</li>
    <li> A piece of the plastic on the side broke off after having it for about a month and half. Hair gets caught in it.</li>
    <li> Works great!!!  Being a mom of 6 one being a newborn my time is limited and this flatiron takes no time to heat up and presses out my hair quickly and gives it a shine instead of a dry look like others I have tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the flat iron for a long time and yes it does snag the hair.  Straightens really well.  I have curly thick bushy dry/coarse hair.  If you have similar hair, try to purchase this iron but with 2&amp;#34; + width.</li>
    <li> Does not get hot at all!!! I purhcased an 1/2&amp;#34; and it works great, not sure what&#x27;s going on w/ this one but it does not work.</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair that&#x27;s wavy, and never wants to lay right so I use a straightener every day, but I hated the idea of spending a lot of money because I’m on a tight budget.  This straightener was the answer!  I used one that my friend had and I was hooked.  Because my hair is thick, it used to take a long time to straighten my hair and I would have to use the highest setting.  I only have to use this one on a mid-setting and it’s amazing!  Heats up fast, glides easily over hair, cuts back on frizz, the list of benefits goes on and on.  Not to mention the price, which is so much cheaper than some of the straighteners my friends have that don’t work any better!  I’ve only had mine for about a month, but my friend has had hers for a couple years now and is still going strong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small note:  When turned on there is a red light that comes on, and a green one beside it that blinks.  According to the directions, the green one is supposed to turn off when it reaches the temp you set it for.  I left mine plugged in for 20 minutes while getting ready the first time and the light never turns off.  Not an issue for me, because it clearly heats up in much less time (like 5 minutes!)</li>
    <li> I wear a heat-RESISTANT synthetic wig, and I&#x27;m able to straighten out the kinks in the broken fibers on the LOWEST setting. Makes my wig silky, straight, and literally good as new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: If you wig is NOT heat-resistant, DO NOT ATTEMPT HEATING. Melted, frizzy wig hair is.... ugly. :D</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift.  Imagine my surprise when he person I gave it to gave it back because it never worked!  And I read up on this product on the Amazon site before I bought it and everybody gave it rave reviews.  What a disappointment.</li>
    <li> product received in good time and we liked it because it was requested by me to give away and use</li>
    <li> Just got this in today! It gets hot pretty fast, and it seems to work pretty well. The ceramic plates are very smooth, and not to rough on the hair. I am an African American young woman, with thick relaxed hair. I do find that I have to use thin amounts of hair to get a much better look.</li>
    <li> I Love this flat iron! I had a smaller one that was on it&#x27;s last leg, but I could not find any Andis product in stores. I am very happy with this flat iron! It heats up fast and keeps an even temp. I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my andis hair Straightener. It has beenheaven to my hair, never have I had a Straightener that works so well especially with my hair type</li>
    <li> The flat iron plates have a little gap and my hair gets stuck underneath them.</li>
    <li> My hair gets hung in a gap in the plates. This is irritating, but I really hate the design. It won&#x27;t sit up, and it is constantly falling over. It heats up and has worked fine.</li>
    <li> Replacement for same brand &amp; model which finally died after several years of daily use.</li>
    <li> While using it, hair gets trapped between the ceramic and plastic and is pulled out by the roots. It is very difficult to untangle hair once it gets tangled up in there without breaking the hair or cutting it out.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money -</li>
    <li> My initial review of this item was \\&quot;undecided\\&quot; but, having worked with this a few times, I had to edit this to a 4.5 *s item and include some extra details, especially for anyone else who&#x27;s never tried a flat iron and considering an inexpensive one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one has minimal but important perks, the nicest being a safety closure and manual on/off switch. This unit will not accidentally heat up plugged in however, it also does not have an auto-shut off. For safety, you do have to be sure to use the manual switch or always unplug it (it gets very hot). It also has finger grips which I didn&#x27;t notice on other flat irons in this price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially rated it 3*&#x27;s not sure if I was undecided because of it or not being used to flat irons and it does take a few tries, good hair protectors and some flat pins. It&#x27;s not the item getting too hot or not being ok for fine, unmanageable curly hair: It takes adjusting to.&lt;br /&gt;(The instructions do NOT include specific information about styling)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You absolutely MUST protect your hair from the high temp plates with flat iron hair protectors. I used both one by Garnier here&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0058CJV50/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o00_s00_i01&lt;br /&gt;and Got2b here&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001S48HLG/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o00_s01_i00. You want to use enough but not drench your hair in these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wait for the mist protectors to dry first and pin up the shortest or top layer of your hair so you are straightening the hair closest to your scalp first. Straighten the top layers last from back to front and keep your hair pinned in sections if necessary, until you have all of the curl out. (if you need to comb your hair again do it here and you won&#x27;t lose the style) If your hair is very fine you might want to add another all-over misting (I liked the Garnier for this best because it&#x27;s a lighter mist/doesn&#x27;t overdo it) then, when your hair is both dry again and cool, lightly straighten both layers together. For this reason, the 1 &amp; 1/2 inch size will finish your style more easily than the thinner blades and the size of the blade was a big part of my initial indecision about this purchase. This works the opposite of trying to get a finished curl look with smaller for finer hair curling irons. I&#x27;m not sure I could have gotten as smooth of a finished look with a thinner iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item has finger grips at the tip to help you steady the unit that will help you get unused to the curling iron twirling at the ends of your hair. You DON&#x27;T want to hold a flat iron for the 3 second hold like with curling iron on any part of your hair, even with hair protectors or it will fry your hair!  The trick with these is to use very light pressure so if you&#x27;ve never used one of these or are sporting a new style you want all of your curl out of, this very simple feature, will help you better control how and where you want the heat to straighten your hair. It only took me three times to figure out how to lightly use the edges to add a slight tuck to shorter areas like layers or bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is normally beyond help-out-of-control/everywhere curls and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on a flat iron so I could start with a really good cut and have the extra protector products. This item will allow you to spend more on all the starting products and the good cut you need first and, of course, will have an advantage to these if you pay attention to how your stylist uses theirs on your new \\&quot;do\\&quot;. A good stylist will answer your questions about these too, even though they&#x27;ve been on the market for a while. Curls aren&#x27;t out of style and there are days you don&#x27;t want to or have time to go through all this. Your haircut should be friendly to your natural curls first so if you&#x27;re just thinking about it, that is another way to know you&#x27;re starting with what you need to like doing this for yourself to want to try it to have the best of both worlds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it takes less than half as long to straighten your hair as it would to curl it, you absolutely must keep everything away from this on your bathroom counter until it cools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/2 * less because of the scant instructions and because from what I&#x27;ve read, these all get really hot and do not cool close to as quickly as curling irons; all of these should have an auto shut off for safety but, the safety closure on this one is a really nice, semi-cooled feature when you&#x27;re more rushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, really helpful and quality product for the price. I would consider other Andis flat irons and haircare products, including for curly hair, based on this purchase.</li>
    <li> These flat irons are the best...I have 2 pair of them. I would recommend all women &amp; hair stylist to purchase this products.</li>
    <li> awesome love the product, would recommend it, and going through Amazon was great, no problems, service was great and delivered when they said to would come.</li>
    <li> Its a nice unit.  It does everything I want from it.  one, two three four five six seven&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Ok product, doesn&#x27;t heat up to what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time &amp; I absolutely love it.....Thank U!! Will buy again!!</li>
    <li> This  hot comb get very hot up to 400 degrees. In yes.it work  very  good  thank you!</li>
    <li> It works really well.</li>
    <li> When my last flat iron broke, I wanted a quick, cheap replacement. This one does the job. It is smaller than my previous flat iron, but still straightens my hair well. I have finer hair that is normally pretty straight, I just use the flat iron to smooth it out and get rid of the obnoxious waves near my ears and forehead. My hair does get caught in it, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt. It gets VERY hot, and I have to be careful with the edge of the flat iron hear my forehead, which was not the case with my last one- I recently got a pretty bad burn near my ear. Great for the price, especially for the light use that I have it for.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It heats up very fast and cools down with 5 to 10 mins depending on how long you were using it. It won&#x27;t burn your hair and leave it with a smooth touch.</li>
    <li> Love it gets really hot, so hot I had to place it on setting 10 which made my curly course hair extremely straight. It&#x27;s a must buy.</li>
    <li> An excellent beauty product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the money.  I had my previous flat iron for about 10 yrs, and it didn&#x27;t really heat up anymore.  This one heats up in just a couple of minutes, and has a dial to control the temp.  I am totally satisfied.</li>
