    <li> My mother loves all things Mary Kay.  I bought this for her and when she opened it she raved to me about how wonderful this stuff is and that I need to try it.  So apparently it is a very good set and I should try it some time!</li>
    <li> Satin Hands make my hands feel soft and just as it says, pampered.</li>
    <li> Excellent products as usual</li>
    <li> This actually was a gift for my niece who is a doctor. She constantly has to wash her hands. She really likes it.  It was her Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and excellent and quick delivery!</li>
    <li> Very compact for traveling</li>
    <li> Love the pretty gift bags this set comes in and all the products are delightful as have the peach odor.  You feel like you&#x27;ve had a professional manicure and pedicure!</li>
    <li> I ordered this fo rmy wife and she liked it so much she had me order another for her BFF. They love it.</li>
    <li> I love this little set.  It was given to me as a gift years ago and it is my go to gift when I don&#x27;t know what else to get.  The system feels great on my hands - makes them soft and refreshed.</li>
    <li> Unscented.  Not greasy.</li>
    <li> This is a nice kit. I use it once a week as a special treat for my hands. It doesn&#x27;t smell that great but it makes my hands soft so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> These sets only cost $4, are not intended for resale and are a gift with purchase through your Mary Kay consultant. Find a local consultant to purchase your Mary Kay!!</li>
    <li> This was the perfect &amp;#34;try me&amp;#34; size for a gift.  You can get 3 to 4 uses from this and then you know if you want to buy the full size. I think Satin Hands is a wonderful product, but it might not be for everyone.  This set works out beautiful to try, or would be great as the travel set it was intended for</li>
    <li> If I were going on an extended stay somewhere, let&#x27;s say two weeks, the entire kit would not be sufficient.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It works wonders on your hands and you feel a difference the entire day. Love the travel set size, was perfect for stocking stuffers!</li>
    <li> Product came promptly and was as described. This was a gift and my friend loved it!</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for traveling</li>
    <li> This is a great set to purchase for a bridal/baby shower prize, secret Santa, appreciation gift, you name it! It is unscented which is great if you are giving it as a gift (you never know who has an allergy to scents). I purchased this set for a baby shower game prize, but I purchased a peach scented set for myself. It works great! I do not think you would regret buying this!</li>
