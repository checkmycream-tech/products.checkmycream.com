      <li>Also, great smell.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>I rub a bit on the split ends on any stray hairs - a great grooming creme.  </li>
      <li>but this is great.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, I wish I had lotion with the scent of this product!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a good thing.  </li>

      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>nice feel scent as well.</li>
      <li>My husband and I loved the product, which made our hair smooth, manageable but not greasy-</li>
      <li>my hair looks noticeably soft and straightens beautifully!</li>
      <li>When I saw the price I thought it was too good to be true and for me it was.</li>
      <li>this stuff made my hair look greasy shiny but the ends of my hair looks lovely.</li>
      <li>It looks cute today, I have gotten complements.  </li>
      <li>ABSOLUTLEY LOVE</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite products ever.</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>love love love this produect...</li>
      <li>Such a great product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect consistency and doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling greasy or heavy.</li>
      <li>Worth a try!</li>
      <li>It is just creamy enough to manage hair with a nice fragrance!  </li>
      <li>but more of a cream and leaves my hands looking really greasy shiny looking.</li>
      <li>Bed Head After Party tames the frizz and makes nice soft curls........</li>
      <li>For more intense shine, I would recommend a shine product</li>
      <li>I love products that live up to their claims and</li>
      <li>This product makes my hair very shiny and smooth.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best hair product I have found for use on hair after you&#x27;ve dried it.</li>
      <li>I was surprised how great it smelled and decided to put back another product and buy this instead.  </li>
      <li>I also used it after straightening my hair as I have highlights right now and get little fly away hairs.  </li>
      <li>This is bigger than normal size,so it was a good deal.</li>
      <li>but this is good if you want a little with some control.  </li>
      <li>But I have been using this in combination with other hair products and I have been thoroughly enjoying the results!</li>
      <li>love this size, i have had smaller ones</li>
      <li>Just put a little bit into your hair and it will bounce back and look great.</li>
      <li>I will only use this particular bottle if I wear a ponytail and need to smooth fly aways or if my hair is down only use it at the ends.</li>
      <li>It smells good, is a nice texture (not too thick, not runny), and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my long, fine hair.  </li>
      <li>fast service also.</li>
      <li>It lasts awhile too because you don&#x27;t need to use that much.</li>
      <li>Most of the other products I&#x27;ve tried are either too greasy or too sticky.  </li>
      <li>It such a quick touch up if you&#x27;ve been running around all day.</li>
      <li>I ordered the 5.07 oz of this product, thinking bigger is better and last longer  </li>
      <li>I have very unruly and fuzzy, natural curly hair!  </li>
      <li>Won&#x27;t weigh your hair down and lasts a long time since you only need one or two pumps at most!!</li>
      <li>I use this when straight ironing (in addition a little hairspray for the flyaways)and it leaves my hair wonderfully smooth and silky.  </li>
      <li>The deal I found on Amazon was a steal compared to what I would be paying if I bought it where I live.  </li>
      <li>Cool pink pump container, too.</li>
      <li>it totally adds a very wind blown non fixed look.</li>
      <li>As for my hair I have naturally oily hair to begin with and up by the roots</li>
      <li>I once got ready for a date in a few minutes just putting this stuff in my hair and my hair was done and ready!</li>

<li> makes a calming settled look without leaving your hair flat or oily looking.</li>
<li> The downside of this product was that it was always so exspensive and hard to find where I live.</li>
<li> I will not be repurchasing, I guess I will just have to bite the bullet and pay the same price for less.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little thicker than I expected, but a tiny bit goes a long way, so</li>
<li> I thought I&#x27;d get it cheaper online, but this one comes out like cooking oil instead of fluffy white foam.</li>
<li> You only need a little!</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> I saw the other review and saw that it wasn&#x27;t the foam</li>
<li> I put a little on my finger tip and rubbed it on my hand and waited a bit.  </li>
<li> It puts a little shine on as well.  </li>
<li> But at least I know it will work.</li>
<li> as my hair is so thick.</li>
<li> My hair is thick and needs product to behave.  </li>
<li> and I mean it delivers!</li>
<li> Needless to say my hair can get out of control.  </li>
<li> but to my surprise they sent me the wrong, which is  3.4 fl oz.  </li>
<li> and I had hoped maybe they had got a bad bottle.</li>
<li> Still I was very disappointed by the seller because they did not give me the size that I wanted.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> love this size, i have had smaller ones but this is great.  fast service also. i will always buy this way.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recomended to use this product ages ago.  This is bigger than normal size,so it was a good deal.</li>
    <li> Used this for years.  It is just creamy enough to manage hair with a nice fragrance!  Won&#x27;t weigh your hair down and lasts a long time since you only need one or two pumps at most!! Worth a try!</li>
    <li> Let me just say that I only started using product in my hair about 4 weeks ago because I got a short cut and I have curly hair.  Needless to say my hair can get out of control.  But I have been using this in combination with other hair products and I have been thoroughly enjoying the results! You only need a little!</li>
    <li> I have very unruly and fuzzy, natural curly hair!  Bed Head After Party tames the frizz and makes nice soft curls........plus it smells wonderful!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I use it before and after I straighten my hair....my hair looks noticeably soft and straightens beautifully!</li>
    <li> My stylist suggested this to me and since then I have never been without it. It such a quick touch up if you&#x27;ve been running around all day. Just put a little bit into your hair and it will bounce back and look great. I once got ready for a date in a few minutes just putting this stuff in my hair and my hair was done and ready! This is one of my favorite products ever. It lasts awhile too because you don&#x27;t need to use that much. Also, great smell. I love products that live up to their claims and this is definitely one of them.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from my hair dresser and LOVED it! I thought I&#x27;d get it cheaper online, but this one comes out like cooking oil instead of fluffy white foam.</li>
    <li> love love love this produect... have been using it for years. makes your hair shiny and silk without leaving it greasy. love it.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair product I have found for use on hair after you&#x27;ve dried it. I have been using it for a couple years now.  The downside of this product was that it was always so exspensive and hard to find where I live. The deal I found on Amazon was a steal compared to what I would be paying if I bought it where I live.  It&#x27;s the perfect consistency and doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling greasy or heavy. I reccomend this product to all of my friends when they ask me how my hair is so shiny. ABSOLUTLEY LOVE THIS STUFF. &lt;3</li>
    <li> I saw the other review and saw that it wasn&#x27;t the foam and I had hoped maybe they had got a bad bottle. Nope. This stuff doesn&#x27;t come out as that awesome foam but more of a cream and leaves my hands looking really greasy shiny looking. As for my hair I have naturally oily hair to begin with and up by the roots this stuff made my hair look greasy shiny but the ends of my hair looks lovely. I will only use this particular bottle if I wear a ponytail and need to smooth fly aways or if my hair is down only use it at the ends. When I saw the price I thought it was too good to be true and for me it was. I will not be repurchasing, I guess I will just have to bite the bullet and pay the same price for less. But at least I know it will work.</li>
    <li> It is awesome........... nice feel scent as well. makes a calming settled look without leaving your hair flat or oily looking. Totally great for me. as my hair is so thick. it totally adds a very wind blown non fixed look. and I mean it delivers!</li>
    <li> It smells good, is a nice texture (not too thick, not runny), and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my long, fine hair.  I rub a bit on the split ends on any stray hairs - a great grooming creme.  A little goes a long way.  Cool pink pump container, too.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair very shiny and smooth.  And it doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Such a great product.  My hair is thick and needs product to behave.  Most of the other products I&#x27;ve tried are either too greasy or too sticky.  I use this when straight ironing (in addition a little hairspray for the flyaways)and it leaves my hair wonderfully smooth and silky.  I can&#x27;t stop running my fingers through it!.  I would buy this over and over again.</li>
    <li> Great product. Makes my hair so shiny</li>
    <li> I had to pick this up and smell it because the packaging definitely stands out!  I put a little on my finger tip and rubbed it on my hand and waited a bit.  I was surprised how great it smelled and decided to put back another product and buy this instead.  I recently bought Bead Head&#x27;s Deep Wave curler, so I straightened my hair, then put in some after party and curled my hair.  It looks cute today, I have gotten complements.  I also used it after straightening my hair as I have highlights right now and get little fly away hairs.  It puts a little shine on as well.  For more intense shine, I would recommend a shine product but this is good if you want a little with some control.  It&#x27;s a little thicker than I expected, but a tiny bit goes a long way, so it&#x27;s a good thing.  Honestly, I wish I had lotion with the scent of this product!</li>
    <li> My husband and I loved the product, which made our hair smooth, manageable but not greasy- so we decided to purchase it online. I ordered the 5.07 oz of this product, thinking bigger is better and last longer  but to my surprise they sent me the wrong, which is  3.4 fl oz.  I paid 18.50 for it and charged me 10.87 for shipping !  Amazon did give me an item refund of 7.50 and shipping refund of 3.50.  Still I was very disappointed by the seller because they did not give me the size that I wanted.  A bait and switch scam.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got curly and frizzy hair and this stuff is the best to create good styles.</li>
