<ol>
      <li>I think that this is the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>think part of the trick is diligence with a very good electric toothbrush</li>
      <li>It works great.</li>
      <li>Surface stains don&#x27;t hold up and this is great post-strip maintenance.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Experience more of the wonderful thank you</li>
      <li>If you follow the directions and keep up with good dental hygiene expect whiter brighter teeth in weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works good is pricey.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Excellent was beautiful and wonderful, but after experience pain in the teeth of cold water</li>
      <li>I love my teeth after using this and don&#x27;t mind the peroxide flavor.</li>
      <li>but I consider the benefit outweighs the cost for a better dental experience.  </li>
      <li>It was ok.</li>
      <li>It does make your teeth whiter, but it is mostly for maintenance after using a bleaching kit.</li>
      <li>More like brushing baking soda.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t even think I&#x27;ll be able to finish the tube.</li>
      <li>They felt so clean and polished it was amazing.</li>
      <li>It was full of air!</li>
      <li>None other do, this stuff works absolutely great!</li>
      <li>The toothpaste works fine</li>
      <li>It was fantastic and whitened without irritation.  </li>
      <li>for the actual product, it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>It was far superior to dentists&#x27; bleaching trays.  </li>
      <li>Years ago I used Oral-B Rembrandt Dazzling White Bleaching Toothpaste which came in (5) 1oz tubes.  </li>
      <li>Well they wouldn&#x27;t say that if they ever tried Oral-B Rembrandt Dazzling White Bleaching Toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
      <li>But if you like a big bold flavor and a tooth whitening maintainer, this is a good buy.</li>
      <li>Of all the \\&quot;Whitener\\&quot; toothpastes on the market, this one may be the best because it has such low abrasivity and will not harm your enamel or dental work; however, none of them really work as advertised, and I will tell you why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So, as a educated consumer I am expected to think that $7.00 dollars for a (2.6 ounce) tube of toothpaste is a good deal?</li>
      <li>It tastes good and so far has not made my teeth too sensitive.  </li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed was how plump and full the tube was...</li>
      <li>Crest White Strips or in-office dental bleaching is far superior to \\&quot;toothpaste\\&quot; bleaching.</li>
      <li>/&gt;In order to whiten your teeth internally, and this is where most of the objectionable stains are, you need to use a concentrated bleaching agent.</li>
      <li>It is just misleading - put more toothpaste in or get a smaller container.</li>
      <li>The tubes used to be smaller, more in line with it&#x27;s contents.  </li>
      <li>Guess they want you to think you&#x27;re getting more for your money than you actually are.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t really sold on the toothpaste part of it after using it the first time.</li>
      <li>i would prefer to have the toothpaste with dispenser as after several using the paste is not coming out of tube  easily.</li>
      <li>Really??</li>
      <li>I can really tell its working from the inside out.</li>
      <li>the wanna-be dentist can save his money buying cheap toothpaste and use the savings to take an english class).</li>
      <li>i really like the results.</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t cheating you and you get as much as they advertise.</li>
      <li>but this toothpaste is really doing what it claims.</li>
      <li>Great product, but it did sting a little bit as I had just stopped smoking a week before which apparently made my gums sensitive (who knew).</li>
      <li>I only got this toothpaste a couple days ago and the very first night I used it</li>
      <li>so well is because it has so much peroxide in it for being a daily toothpaste.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s working amazing so far but for a long term not sure yet.</li>
      <li>gave this toothpaste two stars because my teeth do feel very clean and actually already look a little whiter, but I would never buy this again.i</li>
      <li>So why pay close to 7 dollars a tube for a toothpaste that does pretty much what a Crest or Colgate product will do for half the price?  </li>
      <li>As soon as you try to squeeze out the product you realize that the damn thing is half full of air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>YES the tube is half full.</li>
      <li>The dentist told me I&#x27;d need at least 4 intentive cleanings over the course of a year plus bleaching to get my teeth nice and white again -- for a total cost of over a thousand dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Although I have recently changed to a new organic brand of toothpaste.</li>
      <li>You pay quite a reasonable amount of money for this and It will only last about a week.</li>
      <li>When you squeeze it, you find out a brand new tube is half empty right out of the sealed box.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the colgates, the crests, the aquafresh&#x27;s &amp; seriously this toothpaste is fabulous.</li>
      <li>There is no weird taste, no burn, no strong smell.</li>
      <li>The only con I have with the toothpaste is that Rembrandt gives you only 2.6 oz, which for me lasts barely a month.</li>

    <li> The toothpaste works fine but every time I open the tube I am annoyed to find it half full of air, not toothpaste.  It is just misleading - put more toothpaste in or get a smaller container.</li>
    <li> It was ok. More like brushing baking soda. Wasn&#x27;t really sold on the toothpaste part of it after using it the first time.</li>
    <li> this toothpaste has removed stains that strips and other toothpastes couldn&#x27;t touch. yay!  (maybe konedog the wanna-be dentist can save his money buying cheap toothpaste and use the savings to take an english class).</li>
    <li> I only got this toothpaste a couple days ago and the very first night I used it my teeth felt like porcelain! They felt so clean and polished it was amazing. My teeth had zero plaque on them after and my husband already commented on how white my teeth are! There is no weird taste, no burn, no strong smell. I can really tell its working from the inside out. Im not a coffee drinker but the toothpaste I was using just wasn&#x27;t \\&quot; whitening\\&quot; my teeth like it claim but this toothpaste is really doing what it claims. It&#x27;s working amazing so far but for a long term not sure yet.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Beaching\\&quot; Why the heck is a dentist spelling words like that? I think that this is the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ve used the colgates, the crests, the aquafresh&#x27;s &amp; seriously this toothpaste is fabulous. My teeth are the whitest they&#x27;ve ever been.  Yes it is a little pricey but I consider the benefit outweighs the cost for a better dental experience.  The only con I have with the toothpaste is that Rembrandt gives you only 2.6 oz, which for me lasts barely a month.</li>
    <li> I like the product, bur it&#x27;s  Very Expensive!  I don&#x27;t like how they  put a small amount in a large tube.  When you squeeze it, you find out a brand new tube is half empty right out of the sealed box.  The tubes used to be smaller, more in line with it&#x27;s contents.  Guess they want you to think you&#x27;re getting more for your money than you actually are.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste contains peroxide.  Therefore, if it is not \\&quot;bleaching\\&quot;, then what is it doing?</li>
    <li> Um confused here.... Did everyone get  the half empty tube? Im wondering if its suppose to be that way or did I get shanked... I hope not cause this is one expensive brand of toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Great product, but it did sting a little bit as I had just stopped smoking a week before which apparently made my gums sensitive (who knew). But with continued use my teeth were noticeably whiter within days! Will order again!</li>
    <li> Excellent was beautiful and wonderful, but after experience pain in the teeth of cold water&lt;br /&gt;Experience more of the wonderful thank you</li>
    <li> Do not buy this!!! It is freaking expensive and was less than a third full.  It was full of air!</li>
    <li> i am the user of Rembrandt products. i really like the results. i would prefer to have the toothpaste with dispenser as after several using the paste is not coming out of tube  easily.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference after 1 use!  It tastes good and so far has not made my teeth too sensitive.  Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> Works good is pricey.</li>
    <li> If you use the strips, mouth whitening was, and the toothpaste you will see results. It works great. My teeth are a few shades whiter. I was going to spend $300 to get my teeth whitened, but I stumbled across Rembrandt, thank goodness!</li>
    <li> I bought this toothpaste because my usual Sensodyne was not available at Rite Aid. The first thing I noticed was how plump and full the tube was... Wrong. As soon as you try to squeeze out the product you realize that the damn thing is half full of air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While brushing, the toothpaste created a disgusting cigarette smoke smell which I could only stand for a few minutes before having to prematurely quit brushing. It was the oddest thing, I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like that before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this toothpaste two stars because my teeth do feel very clean and actually already look a little whiter, but I would never buy this again.i don&#x27;t even think I&#x27;ll be able to finish the tube.</li>
    <li> Years ago I used Oral-B Rembrandt Dazzling White Bleaching Toothpaste which came in (5) 1oz tubes.  It was fantastic and whitened without irritation.  It was far superior to dentists&#x27; bleaching trays.  It disappeared from the stores and I have been wondering if Rembrandt had repackaged it as another product.  I&#x27;m hoping this one will be what I&#x27;m looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see some saying that whitening toothpastes don&#x27;t work.  Well they wouldn&#x27;t say that if they ever tried Oral-B Rembrandt Dazzling White Bleaching Toothpaste.</li>
    <li> It does make your teeth whiter, but it is mostly for maintenance after using a bleaching kit. You must use a bleaching kit, and then use this product on a daily basis to keep your teeth white. Although I have recently changed to a new organic brand of toothpaste. But if you like a big bold flavor and a tooth whitening maintainer, this is a good buy.</li>
    <li> this stuff gets rid of coffee and tea stains with just a single brushing, my teeth are whiter all the time.</li>
    <li> I am a dentist that has tried the various Rembrandt stain-removing \\&quot;Whitening\\&quot; Toothpastes.  Of all the \\&quot;Whitener\\&quot; toothpastes on the market, this one may be the best because it has such low abrasivity and will not harm your enamel or dental work; however, none of them really work as advertised, and I will tell you why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to whiten your teeth internally, and this is where most of the objectionable stains are, you need to use a concentrated bleaching agent. Crest White Strips or in-office dental bleaching is far superior to \\&quot;toothpaste\\&quot; bleaching. The toothpaste whitening agent(s) cannot possibly penetrate your teeth to get at the internal stains. This toothpaste will remove the EXTERIOR stains caused by plaque, but so will any toothpaste if used regularly. So why pay close to 7 dollars a tube for a toothpaste that does pretty much what a Crest or Colgate product will do for half the price?  It&#x27;s your money - spent it wisely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the \\&quot;Whitening\\&quot; claim because in the minds of consumers, it may imply \\&quot;beaching\\&quot; which this product does not do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim \\&quot;Konedog\\&quot; Koenig, DDS</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothpaste for a while and I&#x27;m a retuning customer- I love it! Surface stains don&#x27;t hold up and this is great post-strip maintenance. YES the tube is half full. They aren&#x27;t cheating you and you get as much as they advertise. The reason this works so well is because it has so much peroxide in it for being a daily toothpaste. That EXPANDS the tube, so unless you like opening up a smal tube with a lot of pressure and wasting your expensive toothpaste, note that the size versus amount is correct and helpful to utilize what you&#x27;re paying for. I love my teeth after using this and don&#x27;t mind the peroxide flavor. Eventually you adjust and taste the mint instead.</li>
    <li> This is the only whitening toothpaste that works for me. None other do, this stuff works absolutely great! Combine with the mouthwash and $$$</li>
    <li> I took a break from this \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; toothpaste during tough financial times (4 years). Boy did I regret it! The dentist told me I&#x27;d need at least 4 intentive cleanings over the course of a year plus bleaching to get my teeth nice and white again -- for a total cost of over a thousand dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still didn&#x27;t have $1k to spend on such cosmetic things, so back to Rembrant I went and added their mouthwash and 2-hr whitening kit as well. In a mere 6 months the dark heavy stains from tea drinking and smoking are gone. My teeth as as white as they were when I was in my 20&#x27;s -- very white indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think part of the trick is diligence with a very good electric toothbrush (I use mine in the shower for 5 minutes 2x/day, the mouthwash swished at least 2 minutes AND using the 2 hour whitening kit 3 times. No matter how one adds it up, I didn&#x27;t spend close to $200. and got the same result.</li>
    <li> So, as a educated consumer I am expected to think that $7.00 dollars for a (2.6 ounce) tube of toothpaste is a good deal? Really?? As the old saying goes \\&quot;there&#x27;s a sucker born every minute\\&quot;...</li>
    <li> The foil seal was removed from inside of the packaging, sketchy to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the actual product, it&#x27;s great. If you follow the directions and keep up with good dental hygiene expect whiter brighter teeth in weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You get what you pay for, yes the tube contents is a little deceiving but that is how Rembrandt was always packaged their products.</li>
    <li> The product was artificially pumped up with air. There is a very little amount of paste. You pay quite a reasonable amount of money for this and It will only last about a week. Really disappointed.</li>
