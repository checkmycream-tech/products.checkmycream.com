### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and by the way it was a GREAT value as well !!</li>
      <li>Best advice go see a cosmetic dermatologist instead of wasting money.</li>
      <li>and im very happy with what im seeing.</li>
      <li>Also while using this cream it is best to use sunblock after applying the cream.</li>
      <li>Over all, I&#x27;m very happy with the cream and can see results.</li>
      <li>I want to add no one paid me to say this lol, I have read reviews that state peopole are paid actors, but</li>
      <li>I thought this was great in case</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy with it.</li>
      <li>Great product... works great on my acne scars.</li>
      <li>I Love it !!</li>
      <li>Fragrance is just loaded with parabens and chemicals and does nothing for scars; I was also not buying this as a smell good lotion</li>
      <li>i know it has already been working good,</li>
      <li>To the seller, it would be wise to state</li>
      <li>I finished one but did not see any good result</li>
      <li>I feel fairly qualified to review this product as I have been using it for over a year.</li>
      <li>, so i am giving you guys an honest review on the product</li>
      <li>It is kind of greasy, so I can&#x27;t apply it if I plan to leave the house.</li>
      <li>OK here are the good things:  </li>
      <li>after months i was finally able to see some nice improvements.  </li>
      <li>ice then wash with cleanser then revitol  OK</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I surely reccommend it .</li>
      <li>Would like to see them fade a bit more.</li>
      <li>for me it took 2 weeks or more before i was able to tell any difference.  </li>
      <li>hopefully it can be helpful to many out there.  </li>
      <li>and i love it</li>
      <li>glad i chose this</li>
      <li>are most embarrassing, they  will eventually go away  </li>
      <li>If it worked on others, good for you, but evidently it didn&#x27;t work for me.    </li>
      <li>And the most important thing is that the smell horrible！</li>
      <li>My product was delivery fast and good quality</li>
      <li>mild smooth nice feel to face</li>
      <li>really good Product, I highly recommend</li>
      <li>I guess I am a lucky girl!</li>
      <li>However, I can say that this scar cream DOES make a huge difference in the appearance of scars.</li>
      <li>so far so good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very light cream and at first I thought it was too light to do anything but continued applying it anyways.</li>
      <li>It is good if you are at home, but not if your going out in public.</li>
      <li>I bought this cream and it when it arrived the jar was 1/4 full.  </li>
      <li>Your skin needs a lot of time to heal and correct scars but if you find a good product like this one, it is possible.</li>
      <li>Basically, if you want a full refund, you have up to 90 days to buy the product</li>
      <li>The cream was super oily</li>
      <li>BUT OVERALL REALLY GREAT PRODUCT  HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
      <li>I rarely get any pimples, but this summer I was overly stressed.  </li>
      <li>One thing to mention is I also used palmers skin therapy oil with rose hip seed oil periodically during the same time, so</li>
      <li>Better off trying natural remedies.</li>
      <li>In the first few months I saw a great improvement in pigmentation, and a reduction in my ice pick scars.</li>
      <li>and I did not see any change in old scars or fine lines, whatsoever, at the end of the three months.  </li>
      <li>This product did not diminish my facial acne scars (indention marks) at all after faithful, twice-daily use for more than 6 months.</li>
      <li>today is the first i using it</li>
      <li>and I noticed a difference after the first month.</li>
      <li>I first got Revitol</li>
      <li>I did not stay consistent with applying the cream.</li>
      <li>OR you may get exactly what you pay for</li>
      <li>First line, Revitol ensignia &amp; &#x27;REVITOL&#x27;.</li>
      <li>It really works , its helping a lot my acne scars !  </li>
      <li>First line, Revitol ensignia &amp; &#x27;REVITOL&#x27;.</li>
      <li>If it actually works I will give it more stars.</li>
      <li>If I had followed the directions and put this cream on two to three times daily every day for the duration of the cream, I probably would have seen better results faster.</li>
      <li>however cream had no allegies on my skin and overall it was ok.</li>
      <li>luckily i bought it on amazon for cheap instead of the actual website.good luck</li>
      <li>It has its own funk smell due to all the ingredients in it  </li>
      <li>But I can say from personal experience that over the course of about a year I have had significant success with this product</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rather have continued to use a product than have given up quickly and still have the same scarring while continuing to look for a quick fix.</li>
      <li>The main reason I tried this product was because they offer a 90 day money back guarantee if you weren&#x27;t satisfied with their product.  </li>
      <li>If so, will that make it LESS effective?</li>
      <li>Really didn&#x27;t see any results on my scars</li>
      <li>Also, it is not a product you can really wear during the day.  </li>
      <li>but it really does stink.  </li>
      <li>This scar cream really works    </li>
      <li>You just have to wonder if this is really a hox.  </li>
      <li>you have to really look for to see.</li>
      <li>After I called customer service and asked about why they would offer a guarantee on a product that you can&#x27;t try, she told me that it wasn&#x27;t a \\&quot;free trial product,\\&quot; and \\&quot;I was the only one to complain about their business policy.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>my skin is much lighter now, and feels smoother.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think a cream can really fully fix them</li>
      <li>But if you are expecting a miracle then you should just go straight to laser scar removal and save your money for this procedure.</li>
      <li>The only thing that will significantly improve those scars is a trip to the dermatologist or plastic surgeon for laser treatment, dermarolling or corrective surgery.</li>
      <li>This makes me wonder, is it real but an older product?</li>
      <li>this product is easy to use, i prefer to use it before i go to bed and after washing my face with acne products and letting my face dry.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin and it is easy to apply.</li>
      <li>My most recent purchase, it seems like they opened the jar and replace the actual cream with something else.</li>
      <li>I can still see all of my older deeper scars, but they are a lot fainter and not so indented.</li>
      <li>I would rate that just as highly as it probably helped things along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was my fault that I didn&#x27;t read the fine print before I purchased the product, but I was really upset that a company could put such a misleading statement of a \\&quot;money back</li>
      <li>When I was very self conscious about my scars</li>
      <li>Please read this if you are truly interested in what the product actually does.</li>
      <li>and I found out that if you open the product and break the original seal, or use the product on your face or body, you forfeit your refund entirely.  </li>
      <li>and I definitely recommend it, even without using it consistently.</li>
      <li>, stare at it, don&#x27;t break any seals or try the product, then return the product (minus the shipping costs) to get your full refund.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Revitol Scar Cream daily for nearly a month and my scars appear the exact way they were.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the same jar for about a month and in the future I&#x27;m willing to buy another!</li>
      <li>Huge waste of money.</li>
      <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable changes to my scars.</li>
      <li>I bought this product a few years ago off Revitol&#x27;s website as part of the buy 3 get 3 free package after researching scar creams on the Internet.</li>
      <li>So far no results</li>
      <li>Looking at some old pictures of me I can say there has been a drastic improvement after a year.</li>
      <li>have scars that are from when I was two years old.</li>
      <li>you have scars that make you self conscious please give this product time.</li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t even need that much to put on  Especially for acne scars</li>
      <li>the real cream supported to be white not butter color.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My daughter has some bad scars.. This had helped her calm her face to where she no longer has breakouts as bad as before. Id suggest this for anyone whos looking to help their scars and breakouts,</li>
    <li> I rarely get any pimples, but this summer I was overly stressed.  And, because of stress I accumulated pimples all over the side of my face.  To make it worst, I would pop and pick on them (bad mistake) causing the pimples to worsen. Finally, the pimples are gone and I am left with scars on the sides of my cheeks.  Because of my desperation to get rid of my scars I tried using products such as Neutrogena (containing salycic acid) to get rid of the scars, but these products did not seem to work.  Finally, I stumbled upon this product and here I am, disappointed once again.  Like these other reviewers, I too doubted the effects of this scar removal cream.  Well, I should have taken my doubt as a warning as this product did not do any scar removing as it mentioned.  I don&#x27;t want to turn these other reviews down by saying their \\&quot;fakes,\\&quot; that they work for the company.  If it worked on others, good for you, but evidently it didn&#x27;t work for me.    Besides the fact that this product was costly, and given that it didn&#x27;t give me any result,but a firmer face after application, I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This scar cream really works    OK here are the good things:  It works  It lasts a while if you use it sparingly and you don&#x27;t even need that much to put on  Especially for acne scars are most embarrassing, they  will eventually go away  Use this item 2-3 times a day..or breakfast and dinner times/and/or lunch time/mid day    the bad things:  It has its own funk smell due to all the ingredients in it  It looks like legit butter and feels like whipped butter if you kept it out instead of the fridge  When putting it on, if you put it on any open cuts on your face, arms, legs, etc. etc. it will burn only for a slight two seconds then its gone  The funk smell will only stay with you for about 2 minutes, after it sinks into your face/skin then the smell vanishes    BUT OVERALL REALLY GREAT PRODUCT  HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> Before buying the scar cream I read a lot of reviews and information concerning this product. (Which I recommend to everyone before using.) Over all, I&#x27;m very happy with the cream and can see results. (Though, if you use too little of the cream to rub into your skin, it starts to crumble if you rub too long.) I&#x27;ve been using the same jar for about a month and in the future I&#x27;m willing to buy another!</li>
    <li> Bye bye stretch marks !</li>
    <li> i just started using it i will rateit after 1 month using it? today is the first i using it i will let you know how is the result at the end of month</li>
    <li> Has not done what it claims it will do.  Still have my scars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne since I was 14 and built scars throughout the years. This cream has made my scars smaller and has evened out my skin tone. One jar lasted me almost 2 months and I noticed a difference after the first month. I just ordered another jar because it&#x27;s like the miracle cream.</li>
    <li> Great product... works great on my acne scars. does what its supposed to do. I&#x27;m so happy with it. I love it</li>
    <li> Really didn&#x27;t see any results on my scars but I guess you would have to continue to use it over and over again</li>
    <li> I think it works. I used it for about 1 month and a half now, 50% of my Acne Scar has gone... i know it has already been working good, even tho i wish it could speed up anyways...</li>
    <li> Over a 16 year time span I have gotten back acne and it has really scared my back very bad, I have lots of dark spots. I read the reviews on here and you tube and bought it to try something. I literally have used it 3 times and already am seeing the spots get ligher. Im not sure how this will work further down the line, but I would say this cream is showing pretty drastic results and im very happy with what im seeing. I want to add no one paid me to say this lol, I have read reviews that state peopole are paid actors, but nope I just needed some type of solution.</li>
    <li> mild smooth nice feel to face I have some scars I first use lemon juice in small bottle then ice then wash with cleanser then revitol  OK</li>
    <li> I have been using Revitol for one month. So far, I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable changes to my scars. It is kind of greasy, so I can&#x27;t apply it if I plan to leave the house. In addition, the website instructs that you should rub the cream in a circular motion for five minutes. The problem with that is that the cream becomes chunky and falls off in pieces.  I&#x27;ve begun to just rub in the cream for a minute or so to see how that works. I&#x27;m still hopeful and wouldn&#x27;t give this product a total bad review. It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin and it is easy to apply.</li>
    <li> My product was delivery fast and good quality</li>
    <li> I ordered the other day and i went online to see review about. i saw that the jar that they gave is not the same jar as on the official website. It look very fake, and it look like someone made the jar and put some cream in it. the real cream supported to be white not butter color. i did not try the product yet cause i was afraid of scam product and it&#x27;s going to ruin my skin.</li>
    <li> I Love it !! It&#x27;s a very light cream and at first I thought it was too light to do anything but continued applying it anyways. Then my scars started to fade within a few days..... really good Product, I highly recommend</li>
    <li> Beware. The Seller &amp;#34;Health Beauty Offers&amp;#34; who sells on amazon sells fake product. The one I purchased recent seems fake. I been purchased this product a couple times. My most recent purchase, it seems like they opened the jar and replace the actual cream with something else. You can tell by the texture and the feel, it&#x27;s completely different.</li>
    <li> Seeing a small difference but, not much. Just wondering how long it takes for it to really work.&lt;br /&gt;I have scars that are from when I was two years old. Would like to see them fade a bit more.</li>
    <li> Product didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my scar. Also the cream tends to crumble after applications as other people reported.</li>
    <li> I am not sure it works.  Scar still remains.  Looks like I spent money on something useless.  Product is not recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had severe acne scars for years now so I bought this product a couple months ago to test it out, because i figured i had nothing to lose.  I just finished the container i bought recently, so i am giving you guys an honest review on the product hopefully it can be helpful to many out there.  this product is easy to use, i prefer to use it before i go to bed and after washing my face with acne products and letting my face dry.  this product will not work overnight, it takes time.  for me it took 2 weeks or more before i was able to tell any difference.  just be patient.  i got lazy after a while and stopped using this, and went back to my regular acne face wash and products to fight breakouts.  after i got my breakouts to slow down again, i went back to this cream using it at night before i go to sleep. after months i was finally able to see some nice improvements.  my skin is much lighter now, and feels smoother.  i wouldn&#x27;t mind buying this product again but for now, im going to try other products.</li>
    <li> After months of using this, I have not noticed an improvement in my acne scars.  I am bummed.  It did however help with the redness a  little.  If I stop using it, the redness returns.  Also, it is not a product you can really wear during the day.  It leaves a yellow tone on your face and is very greasy feeling.  It is good if you are at home, but not if your going out in public.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks.  i have seen some improvement in my scars but the product says it can take a few months.  so far so good.</li>
    <li> Do not buy it. I did not get any benefit from this product. And the most important thing is that the smell horrible！</li>
    <li> This product was expensive ad I saw no changes in my scars as promised. i would not buy again. No good.</li>
    <li> It really works , its helping a lot my acne scars !  I surely reccommend it . I´ll be ordering another soon.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not work I expected.</li>
    <li> Well,I didnt wake up looking like a teen aged this morning.Cannot believe it...Revitol does not seem to be either worse nor better than any other darned thing that comes down the pike,hoping to sucker in people like me who are  {in vain}to at least slow down the aging process.Face it folks,nothing can change it.We are STUCK with it! Revitol didnt make me break out or get hives,or darkening of blood and urine,and didnt turn my tongue black, and I havent given birth to any &amp;#34;batboy&amp;#34;alien Elvis cross creature.so I guess I am a lucky girl!</li>
    <li> So far no results and I have been using it faithfully for 4 weeks.  You just have to wonder if this is really a hox.  Time will tell but as of know no results.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream for my daughter for X-mas. My daughter&lt;br /&gt;loves the product , she is noticing quite a big difference since she has begun using it. Thank you !! and by the way it was a GREAT value as well !!</li>
    <li> I bought this product three months ago, I used it as directed (two times a day) and I did not see any change in old scars or fine lines, whatsoever, at the end of the three months.  The main reason I tried this product was because they offer a 90 day money back guarantee if you weren&#x27;t satisfied with their product.  After I decided to return the product before the 90 days was up, I began the return process and I found out that if you open the product and break the original seal, or use the product on your face or body, you forfeit your refund entirely.  Basically, if you want a full refund, you have up to 90 days to buy the product, stare at it, don&#x27;t break any seals or try the product, then return the product (minus the shipping costs) to get your full refund.  It was my fault that I didn&#x27;t read the fine print before I purchased the product, but I was really upset that a company could put such a misleading statement of a \\&quot;money back guarantee\\&quot; on their website.  After I called customer service and asked about why they would offer a guarantee on a product that you can&#x27;t try, she told me that it wasn&#x27;t a \\&quot;free trial product,\\&quot; and \\&quot;I was the only one to complain about their business policy.\\&quot;  This company, product, and customer service is absolutely ridiculous, save yourself the time and money and don&#x27;t buy this product.  Revitol, you&#x27;ve been served.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few years ago off Revitol&#x27;s website as part of the buy 3 get 3 free package after researching scar creams on the Internet. I came here to Amazon to see if by any chance it would be cheaper here. It&#x27;s not. I was curious as to why there were so many low ratings and one star reviews, so I read quite a few and would like to share my experience with this scar cream to clear up what I think are misconceptions about the product. Please read this if you are truly interested in what the product actually does. When I was very self conscious about my scars I know I was desperate for a cream that worked and real, helpful and accurate reviews.&lt;br /&gt;For a short background.. I had multiple scars on my leg from an accident. I have a light but not extremely fair complexion and as the injury first started to heal, the multiple cuts took on a dark purple color. This lasted at least 6 months after which some of the scars turned a reddish pink color, others stayed a more purplish red. These scars were long and quite wide, with slight indentations and also raised areas depending on how deep the original cuts were. I tried cocoa butter, bio oil and mederma and did not see any improvement. This is when the scars were less than a year old. After a little less than 2 years I was sick of seeing the scars, as they were very noticeable to others with shorts and I knew of course they were there. This is when I ordered the 6 pack of Revitol for a little over $100. They do have a return policy like I have read on other reviews, however you need to actually read it thoroughly because it does state that any opened product cannot be returned and the return time is limited as well. I thought this was great in case I found it didn&#x27;t work after a couple jars or so considering the amount of money I spent on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the product:&lt;br /&gt;I remember my first time opening it there was an odd smell. It&#x27;s not exactly pleasant but it smells like something that does not have fragrance added to it which I did not mind. Fragrance is just loaded with parabens and chemicals and does nothing for scars; I was also not buying this as a smell good lotion so this was definitely not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;This cream can and does separate. This happens often with a lot of products and I don&#x27;t believe it is an inconvenience to swirl it with my finger before applying it. You don&#x27;t have to do this all the time either.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy when applied, although if you put too much on one spot it will take longer for your skin to absorb it like any other cream.&lt;br /&gt;When I first got Revitol I applied it and rubbed it into my scars for a couple minutes trying to remember to do it twice a day and especially after I showered. I did this consistently only for a few weeks to maybe a month or two. I didn&#x27;t see any obvious changes to my scars in that time, besides having my skin feel a lot softer and the texture slightly improve. I did not stay consistent with applying the cream. I would put it on when I felt like it, when I remembered and to different areas where I had small scarring...my face, hand, arm.&lt;br /&gt; I did this for over a year and my scars on my leg have diminished substantially. Those 6 jars lasted over a year with applying the cream every now and then. If I had followed the directions and put this cream on two to three times daily every day for the duration of the cream, I probably would have seen better results faster. However, I can say that this scar cream DOES make a huge difference in the appearance of scars. Mine used to be so obvious you could see them clearly in any pictures taken of me and even from across a large room or a hundred feet away outside. Other people would notice them and ask me about them and now no one notices them or can see them from a close proximity.&lt;br /&gt;My scars used to be a complete different color from my skin. Now, they are the same color as the rest of my skin and practically the same texture. There is still a difference of texture in the larger and deeper scars...the skin still is thinner and slightly wrinkled compared to my normal skin. I can still see the faint outlines of where the scars are but it is something only I notice and you have to really look for to see. I never thought after living with my scars for about 2 years that they would be this unnoticeable. One thing to mention is I also used palmers skin therapy oil with rose hip seed oil periodically during the same time, so I would rate that just as highly as it probably helped things along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have scars that make you self conscious please give this product time. There really is no such thing as a miracle scar remover or overnight fix. No matter what any product or even this product says on its labeling, it will not work in a couple days, weeks or even months. But I can say from personal experience that over the course of about a year I have had significant success with this product and I definitely recommend it, even without using it consistently. When I stopped obsessing and looking for differences in my scars every day and every month and let time go by and let my skin heal, I noticed what a big difference there was.&lt;br /&gt;One other thing is that anyone using or trying to use this product to fix deep indented or ice pick scars, or raised keloid scars--creams will not do much to improve them!! The only thing that will significantly improve those scars is a trip to the dermatologist or plastic surgeon for laser treatment, dermarolling or corrective surgery. A cream cannot resurface deep skin dents and raised scars! So I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s helpful to badly review this product when it cannot do what you expect it to or when you only use it for a monthly a few months. Your skin needs a lot of time to heal and correct scars but if you find a good product like this one, it is possible. Either way, you&#x27;re going to be waiting so in a few years I&#x27;d rather have continued to use a product than have given up quickly and still have the same scarring while continuing to look for a quick fix.</li>
    <li> I have bought 3 jars of the stuff and the product does not work. It has not removed my scars or reduced redness from hyper pigmentation. Best advice go see a cosmetic dermatologist instead of wasting money.</li>
    <li> This product did not diminish my facial acne scars (indention marks) at all after faithful, twice-daily use for more than 6 months.</li>
    <li> I feel fairly qualified to review this product as I have been using it for over a year. In the first few months I saw a great improvement in pigmentation, and a reduction in my ice pick scars. Then I felt like  the process went a bit stagnant. Well I kept using it anyway because I had bought a jar pack. Looking at some old pictures of me I can say there has been a drastic improvement after a year. I can still see all of my older deeper scars, but they are a lot fainter and not so indented. I don&#x27;t think a cream can really fully fix them and I am considering laser scar removal now.&lt;br /&gt;I can recommend it, especially if you are committed to using it long term. The consistency is disgusting though and it crumbles off your face if you use too much. But if you are expecting a miracle then you should just go straight to laser scar removal and save your money for this procedure.</li>
    <li> I have a freezer burn from a ice pack and it left discoloration on my skin so a darker mark,and i bought this product because it says it deals with discoloration this did not work i caught a rash,and it irritated my skin,this was a waste of money luckily i bought it on amazon for cheap instead of the actual website.good luck</li>
    <li> Quite simply...do not buy. Does nothing. I have extra jars sitting around that I will never use. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Not really works like it is said . I finished one but did not see any good result .scars look the same in my face so it is just the waste of money.</li>
    <li> I received this item one week after ordering it. I have only used this cream for almost a month and this cream actually works on me. It does not dry my skin. Also while using this cream it is best to use sunblock after applying the cream.</li>
    <li> I was debating wether to get this or mederma. I was DEFINANTLY glad i chose this i had gotten a dog bite in my upper lip and i was devasted that the scar was huge and dark. So i decided to give this a try and i love it my scar has faded not completely but drastically i really recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product. (And it did come in a timely manner). Upon receipt however, I became suspicious. The jar IS DIFFERENT from those on Revitol&#x27;s official website. Although it is approx. the same size and color. It has only 2 lines of text. First line, Revitol ensignia &amp; &#x27;REVITOL&#x27;. Second line &#x27;scar removal cream&#x27;. On the Revitol website the jars have 3 lines of text. First line, Revitol ensignia &amp; &#x27;REVITOL&#x27;. Second line &#x27;scar cream&#x27;. Third line &#x27;removes appearance of scars&#x27;. This makes me wonder, is it real but an older product? Does it have a shelf life? If so, will that make it LESS effective? There was no expiration date on the jar. Or is it FAKE? I decided NOT to take the chance and returned the product unopened. I have always made it a rule when purchasing from Amazon in the past to only purchase items fulfullied by Amazon. This was an exception. I will not do so again. To the seller, it would be wise to state this is a legit, if somewhat older product &amp;/or jar design to avoid confusion in the future. (The product was cheaper thru this vender than the scar cream on the official website, so I thought I would take a chance). To those considering purchase of this product, do your homework OR you may get exactly what you pay for</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife who got a scar from a medical condition and the scar is improving, well done.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream and it when it arrived the jar was 1/4 full.  The cream was super oily so if you are an oily skin &amp; acne sufferer avoid this product. This did not do one thing for my scars, if anything it worsened them.</li>
    <li> If I use this every day it makes me break out.</li>
    <li> Waist of money.&lt;br /&gt;i have been using this for months now 0 results. so sad.</li>
    <li> This product smelled horrible and It broke out my skin DO NOT BUY! waste of money I wish I would have read the reviews.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t know if this product actually works for months because it is really hard to use as directed (three times a day) because it smells so bad.  I read reviews before I ordered it and most that commented on the smell said that if goes away in a few min., once it sinks in but I can smell it for hours.  With that said, I can only stand to use it once a day.  That might have to do with the fact that I am using it on my arm and it&#x27;s close to my face but it really does stink.  If it actually works I will give it more stars.</li>
    <li> cream worked well. however u may need to continue using until scars fade so i had to use like 3 jars. one jar has a small amount and i think it was too costly. however cream had no allegies on my skin and overall it was ok.</li>
    <li> I used this product to reduce a burn scar. After using this product for about two months I have not seen any improvement. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this.</li>
    <li> I used this for about a month and saw zero results. Better off trying natural remedies. Huge waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Revitol Scar Cream daily for nearly a month and my scars appear the exact way they were.</li>
