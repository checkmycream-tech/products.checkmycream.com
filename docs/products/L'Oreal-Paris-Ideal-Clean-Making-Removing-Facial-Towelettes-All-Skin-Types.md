      <li>The positive thing I can say about it is it smells good.  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t use every night because I have really oily skin and need a stronger cleanser but a good product</li>
      <li>Strudy and makes the cleaning easy.</li>
      <li>As with the neck-firming cream, this product has a strong scent.</li>
      <li>These wipes are great to use on a daily basis.  </li>

      <li>I really like about these</li>
      <li>I really like the ease of use.</li>
      <li>lid of the package does not close very well after some time.</li>
      <li>So much with it being for all skin types.  </li>
      <li>The product does a time-effective job and is very convenient for travel.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>I use them to clean my face daily</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a strong enough cloth to rinse out and squeeze to use like a washrag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin feeling soft and not stripped, no matter when you use.</li>
      <li>I tend to have reactions to things other people find suitable for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Clean without leaving my skin greasy or dry.</li>
      <li>I normally use Clinique make up remover.</li>
      <li>You do have to keep the entire package in a large Ziploc, however, to keep the whole set moist: I wish it had a self closing zipper or something to keep the moisture in.</li>
      <li>Also the cloths are very soft so no irritation.</li>
      <li>It also leave your face feeling clean and your eyes don&#x27;t feel blurry like with other products.</li>
      <li>Soft Cleaning cloths.</li>
      <li>This is a good product - but for me a mere replacement for the skin-type specific towelettes which were my favorite (but are either not available or at triple or quadruple the price that it used to be).</li>
      <li>Removes make up easily without having to rub so hard.</li>
      <li>is the scent, reminiscent of a newly blossomed lilac.</li>
      <li>Soft, and take off everything, even several layers of fiber mascara.</li>

<li> Not worth the headache to return.</li>

<li> These were purchased as an &#x27;add on&#x27; item to an order.&lt;br /&gt;Cleansing wipes are always bedside, if I&#x27;m too tired to do a skincare regime,  at least there are towelettes.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
<li> Sorry :/</li>
<li> I work hr shifts, so when I am extremely tired, just pop one out and wipe off make up and jump in bed!</li>
<li> Not bothered to return it, but ill never buy it again!</li>

    <li> The positive thing I can say about it is it smells good.  The thing I disliked about this product is that it made my face break out with all these painful zits from just the first use.  So much with it being for all skin types.  I&#x27;ll give this product away to someone else to try.  Not worth the headache to return.</li>
    <li> Clean and gentle on the skin and removes make-up nicely.</li>
    <li> Love these towelettes for taking off makeup at the end of the day.  Strudy and makes the cleaning easy.</li>
    <li> Removes all my make up with ease and the best part was it only took one sheet!!! I don&#x27;t wear make up every day so these will last me a longtime.</li>

    <li> Not when I expected doesn&#x27;t clean your face very good.  Will not order again</li>

    <li> Love them, used them while traveling back and forth to Europe two weeks ago.  I bought them as a test product.</li>
    <li> They leave my face feeling so refreshed!  They are WONDERFUL!</li>
    <li> Awesome cleansing wipes!</li>
    <li> I like these: simple and easy. I don&#x27;t use them at home, as I have my own procedure for my face at night, but these are great in my pool bag. I use them  to take off my makeup before diving in, and usually I use the same one again to rinse the chlorine off my face when I get out and shower. It&#x27;s a strong enough cloth to rinse out and squeeze to use like a washrag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin feeling soft and not stripped, no matter when you use. And the chemicals that make it work aren&#x27;t the kind that disturb your eyes later (Sephora&#x27;s makeup remover leaves my eyes stinging immediately, and I&#x27;m not even washing my eyeballs!).  For home, if you used at bed, you&#x27;d be able to keep from ruining a washrag with mascara stains and save on laundry too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I travel, I will likely take these to save space.  You do have to keep the entire package in a large Ziploc, however, to keep the whole set moist: I wish it had a self closing zipper or something to keep the moisture in.</li>
    <li> Bought these for a first time just to try them out because of a good sale. I normally use Clinique make up remover. I use them to clean my face daily and I have noticed that after a while the wipes don&#x27;t work the same or as food. Although all I&#x27;m removing is mascara and eye liner it seems to take a lot for it to come off and the make up isn&#x27;t waterproof. It also leave your face feeling clean and your eyes don&#x27;t feel blurry like with other products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a repeat buyer of these and I love them. Removes make up easily without having to rub so hard. I&#x27;ll keep purchasing these in the future</li>
    <li> These remind me a lot of pampers baby wipes. They are kind of slimy like and leave my face feeling greasy. I do not recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> These towelettes are great for removing makeup.</li>
    <li> I really like the ease of use. I didn&#x27;t have any reactions and my skin is finicky. I tend to have reactions to things other people find suitable for sensitive skin. I work hr shifts, so when I am extremely tired, just pop one out and wipe off make up and jump in bed!</li>
    <li> These were purchased as an &#x27;add on&#x27; item to an order.&lt;br /&gt;Cleansing wipes are always bedside, if I&#x27;m too tired to do a skincare regime,  at least there are towelettes.&lt;br /&gt;What I really like about these is the scent, reminiscent of a newly blossomed lilac.

Not a lot of stickiness as with some other brands.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, great to slip into a beach bag or when you&#x27;ll be anywhere that doesn&#x27;t have a sink handy.</li>
    <li> Love these. Gets all my makeup off.</li>
    <li> These work great at taking off eye make up. I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> Soft Cleaning cloths. They leave my face clean and soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell. Sorry :/</li>
    <li> fresh smell, store it in the fridge</li>
    <li> These make my face feel so clean and soft.</li>
    <li> Works great! Also the cloths are very soft so no irritation. Works wonders too, all my make-up comes off fast without being harsh on my skin. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I use these everyday and love how they clean my skin! So easy to use!</li>
    <li> Great product, fresh feeling and great at getting the makeup off.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan of the smell, but the wipes work great removing the makeup! Might recommend this to others</li>
    <li> As with the neck-firming cream, this product has a strong scent. It is unnecessary, and in my opinion, detracts from the purpose of the product, which is cleansing and feeling fresh. I&#x27;ll stay away from L&#x27;Oreal products in the future.</li>
    <li> Great for make up removal, dry out quickly though.</li>
    <li> Gets rid of the makeup and dirt from my face, these are great for quick face washes.</li>
    <li> I have used many different brands of wipes trying to find one that I liked. Once I tried these, I knew I found a winner. They leave my face feeling clean and soft. They do an excellent job of removing all my makeup and dirt from the day without drying out my skin. They do have a strong scent to them, but nothing to overwhelming. I will definitely be buying these towelettes from now on!</li>
    <li> Too dry to get my makeup off, but they smell nice!</li>
    <li> good quick cleaner&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use every night because I have really oily skin and need a stronger cleanser but a good product</li>
    <li> I am allergic to almost every thing, but these wipes are amazing. Soft, and take off everything, even several layers of fiber mascara.</li>
    <li> Great for travel and works well on mascara.</li>
    <li> Best makeup removing wipes out there. Love them.</li>
    <li> Removes makeup without pulling your skin and causing irritation</li>
