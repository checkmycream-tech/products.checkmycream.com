    <li> smells great, hands feel clean, no residue</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> i work in a place crawling with germs.  this smells great and helps keep my mind at ease.</li>
    <li> As a hand sanitizer, it&#x27;s great.  However, the smell is way too strong for me.  I feel like I have to wash my hands after using it, which only serves to defeat the purpose.  When they say \\&quot;Lavender\\&quot;, they truly mean it!</li>
    <li> get this all the time</li>
    <li> Buy huge! Fill your little bottles for car, back pack, purse, great lavender smells better than a nose full of choking alcohol</li>
    <li> Pros:  large container / kills germs    Cons:  slimy feel to it / smells weird.      I think I&#x27;m gonna stick with safeway brand hand sanitizer</li>
    <li> Great scent, dries quickly, is actually organic, AND plant-based. Only thing EO could do to improve this product is to use post-consumer recycled plastic for the bottle.</li>
    <li> I wanted to have a natural hand sanitizer available for super quick handwashing at my baby&#x27;s diaper changing table. This sanitizer fits the bill! Dries very fast (not slimey like other organic hand san&#x27;s) and has a very refreshing, essential oil lavender scent. I would recommend!</li>
    <li> It feels good, smells great. It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my hand like other sanitizers. I have a lot of faith in this product.</li>
    <li> I got this for refilling my pocket hand sanitizer from EO.  I&#x27;ve had staff in restaurants \\&quot;follow their nose\\&quot; to my table to find out where that marvelous fragrance is coming from. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep it in my bag at all times.  LOVE this stuff for when I&#x27;m out and about and can&#x27;t be using my EO hand soap.</li>
    <li> Products received as scheduled &amp; as described. The practice members at my chiropractic office LOVE this stuff. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love this size an smells good. I bought the EO in small travel size AND this big bottle, I refill the travel size as needed.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use at work instead of the awful chemical hand sanitizers in the hospital. The smell is amazing all the other nurses always ask about it and now I just have a bottle out and we use it along with hand washing. Great product and safe. Definitely recommend and will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hand sanitizer ever. It&#x27;s all natural and the lavender smells extremely good. It also does not leave your hands feeling really dry.</li>
    <li> Makes hands soft, clean, smelling good.  In the future, though, I&#x27;m going to order this from my local health food shop to avoid shipping costs.</li>
    <li> Sought a hand sanitizer that had non-toxic ingredients.  Works well, smells great, however, don&#x27;t like the after feeling left on my hands.</li>
    <li> A few years ago, when shopping at Whole Foods, they offered customers samples at the check out line to clean their hands. It smelled wonderful and refreshing. I generally hate hand sanitizer and I thought this was the best that I&#x27;d ever experienced. When I moved back to the USA and saw that I could order this on Amazon, I was so thrilled. My memories didn&#x27;t disappoint me. It works well on sanitizing / killing germs, and it&#x27;s incredibly pleasant to smell without unduly drying out my hands. This may become the sanitizer for the rest of my life...</li>
    <li> This is the best hand sanitizer ever! I love the hint of lavender oil smell, and the gel is really moisturizing and not drying like other products. It is pricey compared to other similar products, but well worth the price. I really love it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and it&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon than it is at whole foods! Sanitizing and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Great non-drying hand sanitizer that smells so good.</li>
    <li> If you need hand sanitizer and don&#x27;t want all of the chemicals -- this is the one!  Love the Lavender scent!</li>
