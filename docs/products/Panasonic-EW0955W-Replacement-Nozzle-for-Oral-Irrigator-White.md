      <li>8 more words required, but</li>
      <li>For second person using the excellent Oral IrrigatorExcellent</li>

      <li>It fit, it works.</li>
      <li>cheap, good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had originally decided to give it 2 stars, but then I read that the &amp;#34;..nozzle should be replacement every 6 months&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>So I checked the reviews on Amazon and elsewhere and more people gave a positive rating to the Panasonic than the Waterpik.  </li>
      <li>It is not an exact fit but did fit after some sanding to reduce its diameter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Bought these for my husband and he loves being able to have replacements since he absolutely loves the water pic they attach to.</li>
      <li>a very, very smart purchase!</li>

      <li>Great little product.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to keep their mouth free of particles the tooth brush missed.</li>
      <li>Compact and efficient with enough power to keep my mouth clean and healthy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s decent for the price , however it does have to be filled twice to do 1 through cleaning of your mouth .</li>
      <li>I use it on the lower setting because my gums kept bleeding on the higher setting, and I add about a teaspoon&#x27;s worth of Listerine with the water to keep everything well sanitized.  </li>
      <li>that since buying it, I decided that we&#x27;d use separate irrigators instead of the same one, but should we take only one along when we travel, this nozzle is very worthwhile!</li>
      <li>is very very</li>
      <li>Nozzle broke of at first use.</li>
      <li>Perfect replacement part for the Panasonic oral irrigator, difficult to find elsewhere.</li>
      <li>And it does exactly what you think it will do.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t much to offer in the way of a product review, they are official Panasonic branded and they work</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very please with it.</li>
      <li>I really like the Panasonic Oral Irrigator for travelling, I decided to purchase the replacement nozzle for replacement as required.</li>
      <li>This oral irrigator works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fast delivery and reasonably priced...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very convenient to pack for travel.  </li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t move around too much.</li>
      <li>I ready to chuck this unit.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not much else to say.</li>
      <li>Quality superior to the other big name brand (initials WP).  </li>
      <li>I bought this to replace the plugged nozzle on my older Panasonic irrigator.  </li>
      <li>Right after I replaced the old nozzle with the new one, the unit works like new again.  </li>
      <li>But it does the job well, and is so much quieter than my old one!  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended product.</li>
      <li>The top attachment broke down in 2 weeks !</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is useful and convenient for my daily use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>OK, so this one works well, but I was surprised initially at how quickly the session is over because of its small water tank, compared to the WaterPik.</li>
      <li>I am looking around for another brand while i pamper this new version along.</li>
      <li>It is by no means a professional apparatus , but it is a decent device to augment oral hygiene</li>
      <li>Also the power is a little light.</li>
      <li>but i even took old one completely apart, fixed switch, and reassembled and it still works.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For second person using the excellent Oral IrrigatorExcellent</li>
    <li> Good accessory to expand the use of the irrigator for the whole family. I just wish the price wasnt so expensive though.</li>
    <li> My daughter is using the oral irrigator, and her dentist is VERY impressed with her improved oral hygiene.  It&#x27;s also very convenient to pack for travel.  So far, we haven&#x27;t needed to replace the nozzle, but I like to be prepared.</li>
    <li> This is the best appliance to keep your pearly whites and pinky gums in tip top shape.  Easy to use. I happen to use my own rechargeable AA batteries.  Divine to pack and travel with, although I use at the homefront also!</li>
    <li> The replacement nozzles work exactly as expected. But note, they are nozzles, not brushes as the photo might lead one to believe. Therefore I&#x27;ve uploaded a photo of the package, as received. I might also add that delivery came very quickly and that it was safely and well wrapped</li>
    <li> Bought these for my husband and he loves being able to have replacements since he absolutely loves the water pic they attach to.</li>
    <li> Fits and works as stated.</li>
    <li> My old WaterPik finally gave up the ghost after over 12 years of use and I needed to replace it.  By the way, using a water flosser has saved both my teeth and sanity!  OK, so this one works well, but I was surprised initially at how quickly the session is over because of its small water tank, compared to the WaterPik. But it does the job well, and is so much quieter than my old one!  I use it on the lower setting because my gums kept bleeding on the higher setting, and I add about a teaspoon&#x27;s worth of Listerine with the water to keep everything well sanitized.  I&#x27;ve had it for about a month and haven&#x27;t had to change the batteries yet, and because of its small size, I can now take it with me when I travel.</li>
    <li> I purchased this so both my husband and I could use the Oral Irrigator.....a very, very smart purchase! Really great products!</li>
    <li> my experience with this item is good. I like it and use every morning. But the same things was broken, now I have it.</li>
    <li> At the time of this writing, the product page does not specify that this is a two-pack. I haven&#x27;t much to offer in the way of a product review, they are official Panasonic branded and they work, I just wanted to let people know that they are getting two nozzles with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s goofy that Amazon doesn&#x27;t list this properly because the price looks sweeter when you know you are getting two instead of one.</li>
    <li> good product, cannot replace the teethbrushing</li>
    <li> My dentist told me to buy a waterpik -- had no idea how it worked.  So I checked the reviews on Amazon and elsewhere and more people gave a positive rating to the Panasonic than the Waterpik.  Thus, I bought the Panasonic.  I don&#x27;t know if it working the way it should, but you have to stay over the sink, so while it is going, you just spit the water out into the sink.  If you want to use it a long time, there isn&#x27;t enough water and you have to keep refilling it.  I guess it is OK, but I needed a waterpik so there it is.</li>
    <li> I like this product.&lt;br /&gt;It is useful and convenient for my daily use.&lt;br /&gt;YOu must have to try it. Cool!</li>
    <li> The Panasonic replacement Nozzle works well. Exactly like the nozzle which was included in the original purchase of the Panasonic Oral Irrigator.  The nozzle is durable. After one year of daily use, hard water deposits clogged up the nozzle and needed to be replaced.  I would recommend purchasing the replacement nozzles.</li>
    <li> Great water pick. Works like oem</li>
    <li> I cut off the tip to its base, wired it with elastic band and stuck it to my nose (!!!). And voilà ! now I have a oral and nasal irrigator. Works wonder for me in this time of allergy season. Saved bucks for a separate nasal irrigator.</li>
    <li> Family can share this great tool better than electric brushes. Takes the food residue &amp; its smell away from my mouth</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement part for the Panasonic oral irrigator, difficult to find elsewhere. Easy to order, and great to get 2.  Small enough to be taken on trips.</li>
    <li> I purchased the irrigator and knew I should buy replacement nozzles.  Very good decision as I love the irrigator.  So simle to use.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few times that I think a review is kind of redundant.  I mean, everyone who is thinking of purchasing this knows what this is, as they are familiar with the oral irrigator it&#x27;s made for.  And it does exactly what you think it will do.  If you need this, then buy it.</li>
    <li> Product was used on  trips so that my wife and I could use the Panasonic water irrigator.  It worked well.</li>
    <li> This product has fully met my needs. Compact and efficient with enough power to keep my mouth clean and healthy. My dentist recommended this product since I travel a lot for work and carrying my waterpick is cumbersome. I am grateful I found this little devise. Love it!</li>
    <li> Heard about this water pick from a former colleague.  Works great and holds enough water for a thorough cleansing.</li>
    <li> Thankfully, just what I expected.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an original equipment replacement - of course it works well! It is the same as what came with the appliance and meets all expectations</li>
    <li> The top attachment broke down in 2 weeks !&lt;br /&gt;Total useless  .</li>
    <li> This oral irrigator works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caution: For first-time users, please use the irrigator when you&#x27;re showering as it might leave a mess due to the blood and residue in your mouth.</li>
    <li> Great little product. I&#x27;ve been using it now for the better part of a year - no complaints...helps to keep my gums &amp; teeth healthy. I use it every day in the shower.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s decent for the price , however it does have to be filled twice to do 1 through cleaning of your mouth . Also the power is a little light. It is by no means a professional apparatus , but it is a decent device to augment oral hygiene</li>
    <li> Pros:  nice stream of water.  Nozzle is easy to put on and take off.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  poor design in terms of keeping it clean.  I&#x27;m often having to take the nozzle off and spend a good bit of time cleaning the mold off, which settles along the ridges along the bottom of the shaft.  I don&#x27;t see any practical reason for the ridges.</li>
    <li> We bought as an extra.&lt;br /&gt;Good to own a spare while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;Great service.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed at a good price. What can I say about it. It&#x27;s a replacement for one that came with my irrigator. It fit, it works.</li>
    <li> This irrigator is our favorite, as well as, replacement irrigators.</li>
    <li> love my water pic and love that I found  extra tips for this product  was wonderful that I could find it so easily on Amazon</li>
    <li> Works fine. Not terribly flexible and has to be controlled so it doesn&#x27;t move around too much. But, a perfect travel solution.</li>
    <li> this fits perfect , just what we ordered.</li>
    <li> I really love my Irrigator and highly advise people to get it if you have lots of expensive dental work....Nozzle hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to keep their mouth free of particles the tooth brush missed. Irrigating is, to me, a nice massage as well.</li>
    <li> I bought some extra bits to irrigators, so they can enjoy the other members of my family. Nozzles easy to use, I&#x27;m very pleased. I recommend to all buyers!</li>
    <li> Pros:  cheap, good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con:  would have liked a color option so wife &amp; I could distinguish each other&#x27;s.  Used nail polish to mark one, etc.</li>
    <li> Does its job as intended. I had originally decided to give it 2 stars, but then I read that the &amp;#34;..nozzle should be replacement every 6 months&amp;#34;. The previous nozzle was used for about 3 years before it finally gave up, maybe perhaps got some mucky-muck stuck in the neck (who knows). I bought another set with the intention of using them to death.</li>
    <li> I dropped my Panasonic electric toothbrush and broke the nozzle. I went to Panasonic&#x27;s website and discovered the price for a replacement nozzle was the same price as for the two that I got from this site. In addition I didn&#x27;t pay shipping on Amazon which I would have had to pay from Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I already bought two Panasonic irrigators and me and a friend are happy using them - I love portability. Those nozzles are extras for them.</li>
    <li> low cost. is very very good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 color ring good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;have a nice day!!! thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bye&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bye&lt;br /&gt;bye</li>
    <li> Nozzle broke of at first use. Finally found replacement units but now the nozzle pops out if I use new battery and hi pressure. I ready to chuck this unit. I had previous version for years. Never a issue like these. I dropped old one and no problems. Switch was a little temperamental but i even took old one completely apart, fixed switch, and reassembled and it still works. And I break everything doing that!! I am looking around for another brand while i pamper this new version along.</li>
    <li> This replacement nozzle was perfect. I was afraid it might not fit, it did and I&#x27;m very please with it. Will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Works well but the capacity is a bit to small.</li>
    <li> My Panasonic Portable Oral Irrigator unit started to work slowly - even after I cleaned the small filter and replaced the batteries.  I suspected that there was a mineral deposit clogging the nozzle.  I am glad that I purchased the replacement heads.  Right after I replaced the old nozzle with the new one, the unit works like new again.  Saved Money - Now My Irrigator Works Like New!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  after using for couple of months, my dental hygienist saw distinct improvement so very happy with results!</li>
    <li> This nozzle has a smaller circumference at the base than the EW0950 nozzles that came with the unit so they seem slightly less stable when attached to the Panasonic EW1211A Cordless Water Flosser. But, for all practical purposes, they work as well as the EW0950 nozzles.</li>
    <li> purchased as accessory for oral Irrigator which was purchased as a gift for my granddaughter. just less expensive to purchase with the unit</li>
    <li> I think I will introduce a friend to buy, share the good stuff，Very affordable price, my family and I are very happy</li>
    <li> Quality is good - I really like the Panasonic Oral Irrigator for travelling, I decided to purchase the replacement nozzle for replacement as required.</li>
    <li> What do you say about a replacement nozzle.  It is the replacement nozzle for the item I bought and my husband loves it.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used them yet.  Will get back to you when I do. 8 more words required, but I don&#x27;t have any more words.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly in the Irrigator</li>
    <li> I bought some extra replacement nozzles to have on hand.  Very easy to change.</li>
    <li> The replacement is just as good as the original nozzle</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace the plugged nozzle on my older Panasonic irrigator.  It is not an exact fit but did fit after some sanding to reduce its diameter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not much else to say.</li>
    <li> Good replacement, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> very cool and versatile, love this replacement, it´s an excellent complement e r q e s f g q e</li>
    <li> Great product, good price, works great in the shower (no mess around the sink) and perfect for travel! Highly recommended product.</li>
    <li> Quality superior to the other big name brand (initials WP).  Performance is just what I wanted and expected.  And no dribbling down the chin or spraying all over the sink.  Will be ordering a second one for travel.  Am very happy!</li>
    <li> My husband and I favor the Panasonic Oral Irrigator over all others. That device, however, only comes with one nozzle, so this nozzle solves the need for an extra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that since buying it, I decided that we&#x27;d use separate irrigators instead of the same one, but should we take only one along when we travel, this nozzle is very worthwhile!</li>
    <li> Good product both for my husband and me</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and reasonably priced...</li>
    <li> Fits machine like it should. Will buy these again!</li>
    <li> These nozzles work great, and I love the colored band that goes around it to differentiate whose nozzle it belongs to.</li>
