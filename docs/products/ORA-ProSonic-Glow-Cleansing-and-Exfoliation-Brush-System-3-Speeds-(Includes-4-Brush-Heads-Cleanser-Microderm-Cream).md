<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Prosonic deserves no stars,  I wish I read the reviews prior to purchasing such a product.  Initially, I thought the product managed to work properly, until it stopped working.  The ProSonic worked for less than a year until one day it failed to turn on at all.  The company refuses to stand by the product leading to a waste of money and extra supplies.  Lesson learned read reviews prior to purchasing a product.</li>
    <li> My Prosonic stopped working after 4 uses and the company first told me they were sending me a replacement, but no replacement has been sent. They has been giving me the run around for almost 6 months. I would definitely warn all potential consumers to STAY AWAY from this product, and ALL Make Me Heal products.</li>
    <li> I love this device.  It works well and my face feels squeaky clean when finished.</li>
    <li> This is a horrible product. Internal parts, all plastic (China) broke while using within two weeks, and it&#x27;s been a huge run around trying to get a replacement. It has a year warranty, but the marketing supplier, Make Me Heal (makemeheal.com)has been giving excuse after excuse with blast e-mails about why the replacement is not yet available. It&#x27;s been months now, and soon, the year warranty will no longer be valid. Stay away from the product, avoid Living Social deals, avoid anything by this distributor.</li>
    <li> I ordered this through Groupon because they had a good deal on it.  I wanted a Clarisonic but didn&#x27;t want to pay the price.  I have had this for almost a year, it still works great.  I&#x27;m trying to get replacement brush heads for it.  I use it about five times a week, it holds a charge very well, I only have to charge it once a month.  I have used it in the shower but I don&#x27;t store it in the shower.  It has really helped clear up my skin.  As a 40+ who is still getting cystic acne, the genetic gods have cursed me, it has almost eliminated my problem.  Very rarely do I have anymore breakouts.  I get compliments on how beautiful my skin is all the time.</li>
    <li> It was bought and given as a gift and used about 15-20 times before it just stopped working.  I contacted the company (Prosonic) and their only response was that it was shipped over a year ago and that is all that matters.  They offer no suggestions, no assistance, no options to repair or replace it.  Clarsonic should thank them for improving their customer base, my 3 year old Clarsonic is used daily and is amazing!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Prosonic 1 and within 2-3 months it stopped working. Contacted the company, was told they were aware of defects and that they were going to send me the new upgraded model Prosonic 2.  SIX MONTHS later, I received my replacement product and today it broke again. The entire structure holding the brushhead came off and a plastic screw holding it together had cracked and split in half.  Do not purchase this product.  For the first replacement, I emailed customer service with no response and they kept delaying the replacement and finally sent the product six months later.  The product was great when it was working but at $60 + it is NOT WORTH IT.</li>
    <li> the first one stopped working after a couple months, requested a replacement, finally got it after another 3-4 months.... was told that the old charger would work for the newer brush, but it didnt. requested a replacement for the charger, been another 3 months, still waiting.... wish i invested in clarisonic instead.</li>
    <li> Waste of my money! Just broke right now after having it for a year! Don&#x27;t buy it please! Save your money for something better!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for one that finally gave out 3 months ago.&lt;br /&gt;I had to wait until tax season was finished before I ordered and I am thrilled to again&lt;br /&gt;be cleansing my skin really deep.</li>
    <li> No stars!&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste any time or money purchasing a ProSonic Cleansing brush. I used it a total of ten times and it stopped working. ProSonic &amp;#34;Help&amp;#34; will not replace it. Ridiculous!</li>
    <li> This product deserve no stars. After receiving the product it broke three weeks later, got a replacement it took about a month to get it. The new product broke two weeks later it started to spark. I have been waiting five months for a new replacement and have been getting the Runaround and bogus e-mails from make me heal. This company is a fraud stay away from their product it is complete garbage.</li>
    <li> I purchased this unit from another location about 6 months ago.  This weekend (Aug. 1, 2015) when connected it continues to flash constantly, indicating something is wrong.  I can still turn it on, but I imagine as soon as the current charge wears out, it will quit.&lt;br /&gt;Although my face felt cleaner for using it, that was an expensive toy for as little as it lasted.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Received as a gift for Christmas. Used it for 5 days then it stopped rotating. After checking several sites that sell the product sounds like this happens ALOT. The company is refusing to replace or repair it because I don&#x27;t have a receipt, but it was a gift so I don&#x27;t have a receipt. Disappointed with the quality of the product and less than helpful customer service. Save your money and buy a Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> I purchased my ProSonic from another site in January and other than finding that it produced minimal results, it was working fine. This morning, while in use, the ProSonic began to spark and shocked me. After dropping the unit on the floor, it began to spin at the highest speed and would not turn off. I had to smash it just to turn it off. I will definitely be spending a little extra money to purchase the Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> ...THIS STAR RATING IS BOGUS .....I give this product NO STARS...AND MAKE ME HEAL NO STARS... I ordered mine thru GMA deals/steals....ordered in April didn&#x27;t receive.....kept getting the run around till ...well it was mailed out on Oct. 28....so, a few days AFTER...quit working before Nov. 6... I called and they said mail it back to COMPANY.... NOT MAKE ME HEAL.....and I did so on that day...so didn&#x27;t work a week.....they returned product  (guessing in about 2 wks) saying it is fixed and works PERFECTLY...NOT.... when you put on face the moter &amp;#34;dies out&amp;#34;...so spent LOTS of time on phone with MAKE ME HEAL....PLUS emails.....said oh well, COMPANY IS going to REPLACE.....mail back...GUESS WHAT THEY SENT ME THE SAME UNIT back saying there is nothing wrong with it OR THE CHARGER (WHICH THEY DID NOT HAVE, SINCE THEY SAID DON&#x27;T MAIL THAT PART).....I HAVE NEVER been this HARSH with any review I have EVER done...EVEN IF I WASNT THRILLED with product...THIS COMPANY IS A SCAM, THE PRODUCT SUCKS, DO NOT BUY !!!!!! THEY DO NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT....THIS THING DID NOT WORK EVEN A WEEK....................AM going to turn over to my ccc to worry with.......I CANNOT BELIEVE that anyone does business like this, I also plan to contact GMA about the shoddy product that they promoted and the HORRIBLE customer service....a week, really?????? And you had my money for how long...and I STILL HAVE NO PRODUCT OR MY MONEY BACK...............</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this!!! It stopped working after 3 months. I have a cheap battery operated one by Olay and it is over a year old and it STILL works.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money!! I bought my Prosonic on Groupon the product worked great for one year and one month then the battery stopped holding a charge, Prosonic offered me a new one at a reduced discount as it was 1 month out of warranty. I accepted the offer purchased the replacement and  again one year and 1 month later it no longer works. Do not waste your money!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why everyone has had so many issues with their ProSonic.  I&#x27;ve had mine since 2012 and it still works the same as the day I bought it.  Maybe mine still works because I don&#x27;t keep it in the shower.  I&#x27;ve learned over the years to not keep so called &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; electric devices in the shower because they end up not working in less than a year.  Only issue I have is trying to find replacement brush heads for the device.</li>
    <li> No stars.  While this product worked well during the first year, it has not done well the 2nd year.  I tried to recharge it for 2 weeks and the red light at the bottom just blinks when I try to turn it on.  Based on all of these review, i&#x27;ll trash it and buy something else.  While it worked, my skin did look better.  I guess I expectd a miracle from something on Groupon that was on a special sale.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with my Prosonic face brush. Just had it for over 6 month and stop working. I bought it from another website. I forgot to register when I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I would not recommend this product to any one.</li>
