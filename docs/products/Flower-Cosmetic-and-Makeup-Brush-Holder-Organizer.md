<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was smaller than I expected even after reading reviews that said it was small.  Gave it to daughter&#x27;s friend to put her new makeup brushes in.  Despite it&#x27;s small size it still seems to work.</li>
    <li> It looks nice and big in the picture and is very small! The plastic is kind of fogy not clear like in the picture. The price is very high for what you get.</li>
    <li> This makeup brush holder/organizer was A LOT SMALLER than I expected. It is the epitome of cute, but doesn&#x27;t hold nearly as many brushes as the picture indicates.</li>
    <li> I was able to use this for lip liners and very small items, and I though from the pictures that I would be able to use it for my brushes, but the holder is too small. I do like the new use for it, but it was not my purpose.</li>
    <li> Having read some reviews referencing the size and height, my initial reaction was similar when I saw the box:  This is small!  As it turns out, however, it&#x27;s also perfect.  It holds multiple brushes and the varying sized slots ensure great fit and versatility.  It&#x27;s well-made and looks much nicer than many other acrylic products I&#x27;ve seen.  A huge benefit of the size is that you&#x27;re not locked in with a large item that tries to do everything and can only fit in one place.  This can work with whatever other organizers you already have or buy in the future, and it could be used for non-makeup items as well.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and consider it a great buy for the money.</li>
    <li> Guys will appreciate that her clutter is organized, girls will lie the convenience! In the end, if she&#x27;s happy then you&#x27;re happy.</li>
    <li> This was a bit smaller than I expected.  I gave it to my niece for her small collection of cosmetic brushes.</li>
    <li> I love this make-up brush holder.  It holds quite a few brushes... esp. of the thinner variety.  I have about 15 brushes in mine and it separates them well.  It&#x27;s light weight, so it&#x27;s easy to transport to different locations.  I don&#x27;t like many things on my bathroom counter so this is important to me.  If you have a lot of larger brushes (tall and wide), you may need something else in addtion to this.  I bought a tall bathroom toothbrush holder for those.  I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Right when I opened my package, I though this was REALLY small. But when i started putting my makeup brushes in it, i realized that there was plenty of space. This product holds all of my brushes and looks so adorable on my bathroom counter! Recommend!</li>
    <li> Does not hold brushes securely.</li>
    <li> Item is much smaller than it looks. I&#x27;m able to keep eyeliners and mascaras in it. However, it really doesn&#x27;t work for makeup brushes. The sides are too low and small to hold them up.</li>
    <li> This organizer has a small footprint, but accommodates a lot of my medium and slim brushes. The clear material is a plus, as it kind of fades into background while holding my stuff.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this holder couple of weeks ago and I really like it so far! my brushes fit really well and are easy to access. The quality is really good also, looks like its going to last quite a while. I do think that the side slots could be a little deeper and wider, but it can be worked around. I was a little surprised by its actual size when I received the holder for some reason its looked larger on the picture. Overall its a great product to organize your vanity !</li>
    <li> I was able to fit in long and short sized makeup brushes and its now easier to grab one quickly. Now i get to leave my bathroom drawer neatly every after use. ilike it a lot!</li>
    <li> This has helped with my makeup organization so much. It holds quite a bit, lipsticks, eye liner, mascara, makeup brushes. It is really pretty and does not take up much space. Im thinking about ordering another one to hold nail supplies. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this makeup brush holder. It is very small but holds my everyday brushes a few eyeliners and lip liners. This is a perfect addition to any woman who appreciates the easy of organizing/accessing their faves with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit contains small circular slits for the lip liners or eyeliners with room to put a mascara and the everyday essentials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make NOTE, this unit is for standard or small sizes only. Long handled brushes or short fat kabuki brush will not fit.</li>
    <li> the product is ALOT smaller than i thought it was. in the picture..which is very decieving.. it kinda shows the holder sorta angled like almost steps it looks like there is deeper holes in the back, and looks much larger, i got it and was really disapointed i jus paid 12.99 plus 6.28 shipping n handling FOR THIS??? waist of money. if it was bigger i would say awesome purchase. but im really disapointed.</li>
    <li> I used to just throw all my brushes in a plastic cup, this thing separates my brushes so I can easily find the one I need!! Great product!</li>
    <li> This is great for lip brushes, liners and lipstick. Makes it easier to find my favorite ones.You won&#x27;t go wrong with this little organizer.</li>
    <li> It was smaller than what I expected, holder are not real deep, and my larger brushes do not stand up straight.  Other than that I like it okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was delivered quickly and came packed very well.</li>
    <li> When I first got this I was sooooo disappointed, it was in the tiniest little box ever but as i started putting my full size makeup brushes in there i actually really started to like the size as it saves spzce on my vanity and the holder walls are short so that the brushes lay out in different directions and dont touch each other. it&#x27;s also really nice to have all your brushes right infront of your face so your not digging for the perfect one. there is currently over 30 brushes in there with room for more, im even thinking about throwing some of my worn ones away and putting my favorite everyday cosmetics in there. veryyyy functional. yay so happy!</li>
    <li> I apparently didn&#x27;t read the description well. I really thought I was getting something that would hold my makeup not just brushes. I think the confusion came with the phrase \\&quot;cosmetic and makeup brushes\\&quot; I was thinking cosmetics AND brushes. So I still don&#x27;t have anything for the cosmetics. The picture makes it look like the compartments in front would hold brands like ID Mineral powder. They do not. More like a lipstick or your mascara.</li>
    <li> This brush holder is a bit smaller than expected but is still very functional. My tall brushes lean a bit in it and its great for all those go to brushes. I&#x27;ve got a few of my most used products in it already.</li>
    <li> This is a small, nice organizer for cosmetics in tubes and brushes.  I have been very please with it and recommend it.</li>
    <li> This thing is TINY!  Picture makes it look deeper and more angled.  It&#x27;s a very small shallow holder which seems too flimsey to hold my brushes.  Not worth more than 5 dollars.</li>
    <li> The reviews said this Organizer is small, but I didn&#x27;t think it was Tiny! It does fit several brushes, but not my tall professional style brushes. It didn&#x27;t cost much, so I&#x27;ll keep it, b/c it&#x27;s not worth it to send it back</li>
    <li> This makeup organizer is quite small. I was shocked when I recieved it. It does do a good job holding makeup brushes upright and separated. if they are not too long. Can even put several eye brushes in one holder. Would have given it 5 stars if it were just a bit bigger.</li>
    <li> This does hold all of my brushes (sigma collection) but because of the design it kinda makes it difficult to see all of them clearly and it&#x27;s just really awkward. I do like that I get a place to put all my brushes and that they are all in one place, but I don&#x27;t think I would recommend this to anyone. I&#x27;ll be looking for a new home for my brushes.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t give it to many stars only because it runs a lil small. I don&#x27;t use it for my brushed but its great if you have tons of eyeliners or lip pencils.</li>
    <li> Very small! Definetly cant hold alot of brushes (3 max) without tiping over. I dont know what I will use it for but it definitly doesnt serve the original purpose I purchased it for.</li>
    <li> I work very hard at looking \\&quot;natural\\&quot;.  So I have to have several make up brushes in all sizes and configurations.  These brush holders are great.  They have openings of many sizes that accommodate all of my shaders, blenders, etc.  Great price and very quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Small, petal-shaped acrylic holder for makeup brushes, eyeliner and eyebrow pencils.  The holder takes up minimal space.  It cleans readily by washing with warm soapy water and drying thoroughly.  Not large enough to hold lipstick tubes, but it&#x27;s small footprint is a plus.</li>
    <li> I have been on an organizing kick and have found this very handy!  It is heavy so holds all my things with out tipping as I use them.</li>
    <li> If you have several makeup brushes, storing them can be tricky.  This brush holder arrived yesterday, and I have arranged all my brushes and eyeliners in it.  They stand up straight, and I can easily see where each brush is; this was an issue before.  It also doubles as a very cute and attractive brush display.  Before purchasing this holder, I was keeping my brushes in a small cup that wasn&#x27;t helpful for finding a brush quickly; I usually had to take them all out and go through the entire bunch to find the one I was looking for.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the product, and would recommend.</li>
    <li> I moved into a new apartment with a small bathroom that did not have a lot of counter space for my brushes. This little flower is a great space saver. It holds all of my brushes and leaves enough room for my makeup on the shelf. I would be nice if the flower was a little deeper but for the price and time being it is a nice space saver solution.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how tiny this cosmetic holder was.  it is very cute and sturdy, but not that convenient.  it is small and shallow.  I use it to hold my eye liners, mascara, primers, etc....but other than that...NOT good for holding make up brushes.</li>
    <li> My daughter love it! it is very practical and all her make up brushes fit very well. The shape design is cool too!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a compact makeup brush holder and was debating on going to Office Max or Staples to buy a pencil case holder for super cheap.  However, the benefits of this one is that it spreads out my brushes so that the bristles aren&#x27;t touching each other.  Every brush is nicely spaced out.  It roomily holds my 11 brushes and there&#x27;s still a couple more slots open.  I thought it might be too small for my Sigma brushes, but I was wrong!</li>
    <li> The idea is nice, but I wish the compartments were taller. I have normal sized brushes (I think) from various brands like Sigma, Too Faced, Bare Minerals, Target brand, etc, and they sag annoyingly in this holder. The search continues.</li>
    <li> Its hard enough getting dressed in the morning and trying to make it out the door on time.  I appreciate this organizer for my pencils, brushes and mascara.</li>
    <li> This thing looks a lot longer than it actually is (particularly in the front). If you are buying it solely to hold brushes, you might be disappointed since the brushes it&#x27;s supposed to hold are going to be falling out in the front(the picture is very deceptive).  I don&#x27;t want the hassle of shipping it back for the little money I paid for it, but I will have to use it to hold only a few of the brushes, and leave the three front spaces for lipsticks/lip gloss. So it&#x27;s a disappointment. On the other hand, the material is not flimsy and the organizer itself looks pretty upon arrival, so I gave it two stars.</li>
    <li> I thought this would solve my cluster brush problem, but the openings are so close together that the big brushes on the outside hide the smaller brushes on the inside.</li>
    <li> Although very pretty, its alittle too shallow as the brushes are unstable and fall out.  I would buy the next size up if I were to purchase again.</li>
    <li> Like most other buyers, this turned out to be much smaller than I anticipated.  Please see the product dimensions in the description.  They are true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In spite of the small size, these organizers hold a variety of things without being conspicuous looking.  I accidentally ordered 2 and am glad I did.  All the little things you can never find when hidden away in a drawer are easily visible in this holder - lipstick/eye liners, eyebrow pencils, mascara, lipstick - you name it.</li>
    <li> This is smaller than what I thought it was, but it works fine.  It is a nice makeup brush holder and organizer.</li>
    <li> This works perfect for my makeup brushes and organizing some of the clutter on my dresser, I love it!  I am going to order several more for my makeup pencils and such. Very well made, priced very resonable. I do recommend.</li>
    <li> Hold all of my eye brushes in place.  very cute I have had mine for over 3 months and it does not take to much space on my counter. It hold about 25 of my eye brushes.</li>
    <li> It holds all of my makeup brushes and makeup effectively. I like it because it is small and a space saver.</li>
    <li> The size of the flower cosmetic and makeup brush holder was much smaller than i expected.  The product met my needs.</li>
    <li> Very nice makeup brush/pencil holder, would buy again</li>
    <li> I have very l little counter space so this little brush holder is perfect.  It has 6 larger holes on the outer ring and 6 small holes on the inner ring.</li>
    <li> So handy for all my brushes. Keeps them clean and on a nice display. Only thing I would say I would change is having the smaller compartments in the center. You have to go through your brushes to get to those. Otherwise, great!</li>
    <li> to small. holes not deep enough for brushes...I should return it smh</li>
    <li> A lot smaller than I expected.  It didn&#x27;t work well for makeup brushes.  I&#x27;m currently using it for lip pencils, lipsticks and mascara.  It works pretty good in that capacity.</li>
    <li> I use this in my craft room as for it&#x27;s intended purpose for make-up and brush holder, it falls short, literally.  Pay attention to the size, as I was asuming that the measurements were off based off of the images posted at the time I bought and the description of the product.  If you are using doll size brushes and make-up, perhaps this would work for you.</li>
    <li> I bought this to store paint brushes and it&#x27;s perfect! It makes the brushes fan out, making them easy to find. It looks small at first, but the design makes everything less cluttered!</li>
    <li> This little container holds my tweezers, mascaras, brushes, and liners as well as several lip glosses and pencils.  It takes up a very small space on the counter too.  Very happy with this item!</li>
    <li> I thought that this was going to be bigger than what it was. Although there are pictures of someone holding it to give an idea of the size, it is still a lot smaller than what I wanted. The pictures were a little deceiving.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my make up brushes; and it is extremely small!!!!! It fit on the palm of my hand and I have small hands ! The brushes looks extremely weird on a small thing. A quarter fits in one of the holes &amp; I paid about 16$ for this. And I couldn&#x27;t get a refund not one response.</li>
    <li> Too short, half of my lipsticks did not fit.  And I could not use it for brushes as it is too short.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter for her vanity. She loved the design of it, but it was too small, so she gave to my other daughter for a second organizer. Looks very nice.</li>
    <li> This is small and holds all my daily brushes.  The middle holes are good for brow pencils, etc.  The size is good and it is worth the price.</li>
    <li> Love these brush holders.  I just need one more. ( Have 2)</li>
    <li> The picture makes it look huge.. when I got it I was disappointed by how small it is. It only fits one thing in each hole.. booo</li>
    <li> I was very disapointed with this item, it was way smaller than I thought for the price and the height of each tube is so short that things keep falling off it (I put my cosmetic brushes in it) it does not hold a lot of them so I needed to get an extra cup for the rest of my makeup brushes.  Overall I think this item is not worth the price and is not very useful!</li>
    <li> Do not order this is very very small. It is a joke going to send back I ordered 2 today.</li>
    <li> The holes where the brushes go in are not deep enough and the bushes tend to fall out a lot.</li>
    <li> This is fairly small in diameter but has a lot of little spaces for brushes&amp; just fits my shelf space I&#x27;ve allotted. If needed it could also be re-purposed for pencils or paint brushes, marking pens in a craft room. I have a favorite lipstick in one of the front slots and lipstick brushes, lip liners. Great product.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for my makeup brushes! I have drawers for my big stuff but this is just what I need for all of my eyeliners, makeup brushes and other slim makeup products. Very pretty on my vanity too!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s adorable and just what I needed! Don&#x27;t have 2 much makeup so it&#x27;s perfect for me. Make sure before you get to check the measurements I thought its a little bigger..</li>
    <li> These makeup brush holders are very well made they keep my makeup supplies clean and lint free</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas present for my mother-in-law. She has about 10 different lipsticks. She thinks it&#x27;s the perfect gift.</li>
    <li> I was surprised and disappointed with product.  Although the quality seems good the height of the holder makes it impossible to hold my tall brushes, or many brushes at all the item is so small.  The circular cylinders are approx. 21/2&amp;#34; and smaller and the circumference is maybe 4&amp;#34;.  Not worth the money they are asking.</li>
    <li> This organizer is actually quite small--only 3.25 inches in diameter.  I took it out of the box and was somewhat disappointed with how tiny it was.  But I was able to get all my brushes in it!  So the smallness wasn&#x27;t a problem at all, and it ends up being quite an advantage by using very little vanity real estate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to get 4 thick handled brushes in it plus 8 medium-handled, 19 small-handled, and 5 of those short, small-handled sponge applicators.  The petal wells are only about 2\\&quot; deep, the perfect size.  It&#x27;s deep enough to keep tall-handled things upright (I hate deep organizers because they&#x27;re so tall you&#x27;re forced to grab a brush by the bristles), but perfect for even my shortest brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish there were a larger one with another ring of petals to add all my pencils.</li>
    <li> I purchased this along with my makeup organizer 5 drawer with flip top. Love both products... Only gave 4 stars because of the size, its a bit small, but it fits all of my essential brushes and provides easy access to them and storage. Those it does not fit, I just put in my organizer. Enjoying my purchase</li>
    <li> I love this for my eyeliners and small brushes! But if you live near a Ross, check there first. At my local Ross I found this EXACT idem for under $5! Can&#x27;t remember the exact price. But the one I got came in a set of three, this holder, a box with lid, and another kind of awesome make-up holder! All for $9.99! If you don&#x27;t have a Ross this is still worth it in my opinion. My vanity isn&#x27;t a mess anymore all thanks to this holder and the 2 others I got.</li>
    <li> Smaller than appeared had to return it.</li>
    <li> Cute but it was smaller than I expected.  Wouldn&#x27;t mind another one wider but the same height to hold moisture or  foundation bottles or tubes.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  It&#x27;s a bit shorter than I thought it would be.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was big enough when I first received it.  It turns out that it&#x27;s the perfect size.  It holds all of my primary make-up brushes, eyeliner and mascara.  Basically, all my daily use items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I changed my review from a 4 to a 5.  I still have it 2 years later and i purchased a second one.  It&#x27;s easy to clean, organizes my brushes and doesn&#x27;t break when you drop it.</li>
    <li> Its so small! I don&#x27;t have a lot of brushes, and they usually never end up in this device for long anyway. The sections are so small they don&#x27;t fit that many brushes. It&#x27;s plastic and cheap looking, and real holds no purpose if you&#x27;re an advent makeup user.</li>
    <li> This brush holder is indeed small, but it holds a lot. I have been able to get every one of my makeup brushes to fit with room to spare. It doesn&#x27;t fit the larger brushes (ones with a handle of 1 inch or more), but I knew that before ordering. It&#x27;s nice having the brushes so well organized on my vanity.</li>
    <li> very much different than appearance in photos. did not have the \\&quot;flower\\&quot; organizer appearance.  no different sized holes for different brushes.  Will return product.</li>
    <li> Works perfect for what I need!  And looks nice on top of my makeup table.  I keep my brushes on it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t hold my brushes at all...disappointment. The holes were too short.  Just ended up using a cup instead of it</li>
    <li> Love it.  Will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> smaller that what I was expecting but is an awesome brush holder and takes up very little space</li>
    <li> This device is very small but it is very functional for storing make up brushes. I added my foundation and blush brushes in the outside wells and use the inside wells for my eye shadow brushes.</li>
    <li> Its horrible. Extremely small. There are no spaces for larger width brushes. The slots are too small for the average brush.</li>
    <li> I have had this for years now and its still in good condition. Keeps my brushes organized. I have to buy a bigger one because lately I&#x27;ve buying more brushes.</li>
    <li> delivered on time, product as described, I love that design, ease to fit in to my cabinet and organaze your things,  still using , thanks</li>
    <li> This holder is really small. It is very useful but I&#x27;m going to order another because all my brushes dont fit in just one.</li>
    <li> I bought these to hold eyeliner pencils, of which I have a big collection.  I can now sort them by color and put each color in one or two of the little holes.  I think it might have been designed for lipstick and liner pencils and I used one of them for that as well as holding my makeup brushes.  I wish they were a bit bigger, but overall I am quite happy with my purchase.  They replace a two-part container designed to hold Q-tips in the center and cotton balls on the outside that I used to hold all the pencils and eye-tees.  It is now much easier to find pencils, but I now have to look for another container for the eye-tees (for those who aren&#x27;t familiar with eye-tees, they are specially-designed Q-tip-style cotton buds with one end pointed and the other flat, great for fixing or even applying eye makeup).</li>
    <li> The Makeup Brush Holder is much smaller in reality than it appeared online, but it does hold alot of brushes.</li>
    <li> although smaller than I expected it to be, it does the job and matches the other organizers for daughter, who is very meticulous about things in their place.</li>
    <li> I had a great many small items on a table by my favorite chair and this holder has enabled me to organize pens, pencils, tweezers, clippers, little scissors into one small space. I have another one on my desk and enjoy using both.</li>
    <li> I have to admit the picture makes it look bigger.  but i love it! It fit all the brushes I had plus I have more space! I do own a lot of travel sizes brushes so I could fit a whole kit in one holder.</li>
    <li> Love this makeup holder!  I use it for various cosmetics including lipsticks and mascara.  It&#x27;s not too big and it looks stylish.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m big on maximizing my space.  I have lots of makeup brushes that usually end up all over the place.  This product gives me a way to keep them all organized and together in one place.  It&#x27;s very classy looking as well and adds a nice touch to my bathroom. My brushes are now clutter free.  Great product that I&#x27;m sure any lady could use!</li>
    <li> This one is made very well.I feel it will last a long time. I do recomend any one to buy it.</li>
    <li> Holds a lot of makeup brushes, but will not hold my broader-based k brush.  Great looking, practical, and really handy.</li>
    <li> Was pretty disappointed in this little product. The description led me to belive this &amp;#34;FLOWER&amp;#34; of a beauty would would be AMAZONIAN in stature, but my mistake for not reading the measurements in the finer print. It is very shallow when it comes to how deep the hole wells are so if you have long, tall brushes, they are&#x27;t going to stand up well in the short holes, also it won&#x27;t hold fatter handled brushes as the holes aren&#x27;t so big around. The smaller holes will hold possibly 2 small eye shadow brushes if they are short &amp; thin stemmed. My product wasn&#x27;t all nice clear acrylic. It had some &amp;#34;haze&amp;#34; to it , parts of discoloration that when I mentioned it in feedback was not accepted as &amp;#34;proper&amp;#34;, I have no idea why, I wasn&#x27;t given an explanation as I always thought that was what feedback was for, maybe that was considered to be in the category of product review rather than seller so we will see if it gets published here, if not I will know there is a reason Amazon doesn&#x27;t want this product truthfully reviewed, maybe because it is an Amazon fulfilled product. Who knows, this is for truth telling about a product, I may have gotten 1 that was just a bit defective in color, I wasn&#x27;t given the opportunity to return it if I needed a better one. Point is, my brushes are all too big for this little bud to handle anyway. I don&#x27;t recommend if you use the larger brushes like I do. I recommend you submit the truth, take your chances the buying public sees it rather than hold back for the sake of having a someione get a product not worth the money. I&#x27;m stuck with an item I can&#x27;t use or return &amp;  Amazon can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t explain why. Sad to see them coming to this for their consumer&#x27;s sake, I don&#x27;t see this passing their muster to help others tho. Maybe they will surprise me &amp; care more about the customer getting a good product. &amp; put thru a truthful review, my friend has the same product, same problems.</li>
    <li> i bough this and it was wayyy too small to put anything in it.</li>
    <li> Much smaller that I thought it would be, I should have looked at the specs more carefully. Oh well, It&#x27;s pretty though</li>
    <li> This little piece of plastic is absolutely perfect for holding and organizing my makeup.  The variety of compartment sizes are exceptional and will accommodate almost anything you use in the make-up line.  I like it so much, I actually have 2 and thinking about another one to leave in my suitcase for organization when travelling-I think it would be so much better than a cosmetic bag while staying in a hotel.</li>
    <li> Though it had the dimensions I didn&#x27;t really take into account how small it is. But it is cute &amp; in turn doesn&#x27;t take up much space. Thick acrylic.</li>
    <li> One of my cutre acrylic pieces! This was exactly what I expected in both size and look! I use it to store my mascars and my smaller pencils in teh middle!</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews on this product before purchasing and I am impressed with my purchased and very satisfied as many have said before me.  Although compact and short, this make-up brush holder holds a lot of brushes (and I have many as a make-up artist).  I think I&#x27;m going to order another one for all of my eyeliner pencils to further keep me organized in my bathroom and while on jobs.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I must have ordered too much at one time, as I only see the Lipstick Holder and not the flower cosmetic holder. . It must have got lost in the shuffle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renee Evers</li>
    <li> This is a tiny miny short brush holder. Issues, full size brushes barely fit and fall often due to the shortness of the &amp;#34;petals.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Even though it isn&#x27;t that tall, it still works perfectly for all my brushes of varying sizes.  I was using a toothbrush holder prior to purchasing this but it didn&#x27;t have enough slots.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for my bathroom closet for all my older/smaller brushes that I still use but have replaced in my bigger collection! Def. useful &amp; recommended.</li>
    <li> i have this EXACT one the only differenece is that i got MY&#x27;N at a dollar store for a dollar and i would say that its a good product</li>
    <li> Looks look the brushes might fallout. Far from the truth. Great product would recommend. Very clean look. Looks great on my vanity</li>
    <li> So tiny nothing fits in it.  The image looks larger.  Don&#x27;t let it fool you it is basically useless.  Cute though for added clutter.</li>
    <li> Great organizer. Have my most used makeup items right&lt;br /&gt;to hand!&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this for anyone who needs to have their makeup&lt;br /&gt;at their fingertips!</li>
    <li> My brushes fit perfectly in this and I love it. Good Quality. Perfect! It looks a little small in person but I can put all of my skinny brushes and also regular brushes in there. I can fit about 3 brushes per circle without it looking un-comfortable or un-manageable.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush holder thinking all my brushes would fit and was sadly dissapointed. This brush holder will hold many brushes only if your brush holders are thin. For those ladies out there that have a combo of both thick and thin this will probably not hold much.</li>
    <li> Was a nice gift for my sister who is a makeup artist. Organized her brushes for quick grabbing</li>
    <li> This was a waste to buy...very tiny and shallow. Photo is deceiving</li>
    <li> YOU CAN NOT TELL IN THE PIC HOW SMALL IT IS. IF YOU HAVE LARGE BRUSHES THIS IS NOT FOR YOU.  IT IS GREAT FOR LITTLE THINGS.  I WILL USE IT BIT WAS SHOCKED BY THE SIZE.</li>
    <li> This was smaller than I expected but is a great product to keep your makeup and beauty tools organized. Very durable.</li>
    <li> Holds all of my brushes easily.  Heigth of the 6 cylinderical plastic tubes is graduated from 1 1/2 inches to approximately 1 3/4 inches. Width of each 6 outer tubes is approximately 1 inch.  Inner tubes width is less than a 1/2 inch each. Total length and width  of makeup brush holder is a little over 3 inches. My longest brush is not quite 6 inches.  Any brush of longer length might pose a problem with the stability of the plastic makeup brush holder.</li>
    <li> This organizer is small but very helpful. My brushes and things are neat and clean. I recommend this product to my girlfriends.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of brushes, but it doesn&#x27;t fit my larger face brushes adequately. I&#x27;d buy two or just consider a different brush holder altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sturdy and easy to clean, however. It does the job. If you have a small brush collection, this should be sufficient.</li>
    <li> Probably my fault didn&#x27;t read the size measurements but looking at the picture you would think it would be a bit bigger. think round paperweight size.</li>
    <li> This product is almost perfect. It is very sturdy and holds lots of brushes but I have 2 powder brushes that it doesn&#x27;t hold because the diameter of the holes are too small</li>
    <li> great stuff it was what i was expecting really satisfied with the product. 5 stars all day everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;enjoy everyone.</li>
    <li> it is not the size i was expecting, i was hoping it was gonna be large but it holds at least like 8 of my 215 brushes</li>
    <li> This thing is really small...I guess I didn&#x27;t really pay attention to the dimensions when I purchased it.  But, I decided to give it a try anyway and to my surprise, it holds my new \\&quot;super-sized\\&quot; Sephora make-up brushes (didn&#x27;t pay attention to the dimensions of those either, lol)!  It actually holds ALL my brushes, which includes two full sets of 8 brushes, plus a full set of 6 shadow brushes.  The little holes in the middle are perfect for skinny brushes, or even those little perfume samples you get sometimes.  The only thing that didn&#x27;t fit is my kabuki brush because the handle is wider than the holes.  The plastic is strong, and the brushes look great all fanned out on display in it.  I&#x27;m definetly going to keep this!</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this item, but when I received it I found that it is too small.  If you&#x27;re a person that seldom wears makeup and so only have a couple of brushes, than this is good for you.  If you like costmetics-- forget it.  There&#x27;s not enough room for your brushes and the item is too shallow so it looks messy.  I&#x27;m returning the item.</li>
    <li> I use this for my cosmetic brushes.  It has many spots for all the brushes.  I wish they were slanted, however, so the brushes in back were easier to get to.  It works great, however.</li>
    <li> Perfect for organizing a  vanity.  I got it for my best friend for Christmas and she loves it! I need one myself.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good product for the money! I needed something to keep my brushes more organized (I&#x27;m a makeup junkie and I don&#x27;t like throwing my brushes into my case) as well as keep my space clean. This functions well for both tasks! It is a bit shorter than I thought it would be, but it fit all 24 of my brushes of varying sizes and so far, it hasn&#x27;t fallen over even though it feels a bit unwieldy. We will see what happens. :p Overall, satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have several makeup brushes, but this little holder keeps them all.  It actually makes them look pretty as they fan out slightly! Making for easy access. The various sized holes mean you can have more than one in each, which is handy.  Love the height and size, as it minimizes the impact on my bathroom counter, and is low key, being clear acrylic.</li>
    <li> No mess again! Good help for girls. I will definitely buy again! Love to organize everything well. Good product with good quality.</li>
    <li> I was surprisd at how small this item was for the price. It seems more like a Dollar Store buy....</li>
    <li> i really like this for all of my makeup brushes. it&#x27;s a bit small, and doesn&#x27;t hold all of my brushes. if you are a big makeup user and have more than 6-8 brushes, this might be too small for you. i just put my most used brushes in it on my counter top next to all of my makeup and it looks great. overall, its great for the price. i would recommend this for sure!</li>
    <li> Very tiny, but does the job. Not exactly what I wanted, but will do until I find something similar that will hold more.</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking it would hold my makeup brushes...Nope, not even close. I think it would work if your brushes have very skinny handles &amp; are very, very short, but my makeup brushes have longer, much larger handles, &amp; some of them don&#x27;t even fit. (BTW, my makeup brushes are made by Real Techniques, EcoTools, &amp; Sigma...for reference). I am now using it to hold six lipsticks, since that&#x27;s all it holds, &amp; a few very skinny eyeliners on the middle. For makeup brushes, I would highly recommend the Wavy Acrylic Makeup Brush Holder that is sold here on Amazon for about $17. It holds tons of brushes...All sizes!</li>
    <li> Just what i need it! Smaller than what i tought but still looks great on my make up table and holds many brushes and lipsticks!</li>
    <li> The picture gives you the impression that is will hold all of your regular make up brushes.  It will NOT.  The holder is so short that my brushes all just fell out.  If you have smaller brushes that you get with make up samples, is will do.</li>
    <li> was smaller than expected but holds quite a few brushes.I was satisfied with it.would have liked it a little taller</li>
    <li> This well designed makeup brush holder is, just as others have mentioned, perfect but very small. The good news is that it&#x27;s compact size takes up little space, and it is quite sufficient as a brush holder. I like it.</li>
    <li> A little too small for some of the brushes I own, but will get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;A b c</li>
    <li> This product is tough. It&#x27;s to big for most make-up brushes and too small for others. I could have done without this purchase.</li>
    <li> This picture is a bit deceiving....it looks a lot bigger than it is.....my husband order this for me as a gift and thought he was sent the wrong item because it is much smaller than it appears in the picture. I will probably not use it for makeup brushes but may work for my lipstick.....i might even return this item.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3/2013.....I did end up using this for my make-up brushes and I really like it...I didnot think it would hold the brushes in place...but it works perfect.</li>
    <li> My makeup brush holder was extremely SMALL. The picture is very deceiving.  It does not hold all my brushes. It only holds medium to small brushes. Overall the shape is cute but I am disappointed in the size.</li>
    <li> Its very nice. However I bought it for makeup brushes and its was to small. Its no where near the size it looks in the picture.</li>
    <li> I wish this makeup brush holder had higher \\&quot;walls\\&quot; because they are just too low.  It does not provide the makeup brushes any stability and the fall over to the side, which is completely defeating the purpose of having this organizer.  Great concept, just needs tweaking.  I have to return it because I&#x27;ll certainly never use it the way it is right now.</li>
    <li> This works really well for most of my beauty supplies, but it&#x27;s be nice if it was a bit taller.  I got something else to hold eye pencils, but it works nicely for makeup brushes, lip products, or mascara!</li>
    <li> It does what it is suppose to do....i just didn&#x27;t think it was as small as it was. I brought this for my daughter to put on her new vanity</li>
    <li> I thought it would be larger; however it can be used for other things. I will work for someone that needs something smaller.</li>
    <li> This works well it organizes my make-up brushes so well. It is small and does not take up a lot of space.</li>
    <li> I thought that the cup holder would be larger, but it&#x27;s actually really small and when I put my brushes in it it looked unorganized and messy. I was very disappointed but now I put my favorite lip products in it so it wasn&#x27;t a total waste.</li>
    <li> This brush holder does the job, but I did think that it would be a somewhat bigger than what I received.</li>
    <li> This is very small but I guess it is suppose to be.  It also doesn&#x27;t look like it would hold a lot due to small size.  Good purchase if you only use small amount of make up brushes.</li>
    <li> This is very small but great use for makeup brushes and eyeliner! Looks cute on counter top! Would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I expected. But its durable and holds a few brushes. What else is there to say would I buy it again, probably not. Better off going to the drug store and making a purchase of like kind.</li>
    <li> This was such a WASTE of my money.  This picture is mid-leading to say the least.  See that small black pencil sitting upright in the outer opening?  Well I can guarantee you that your pencil will not stay there.  Its too shallow!  It is a joke to return because after shipping fees you end up with less than half your money back.  DON&#x27;T BUY THIS!!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent holder for makeup brushes!!  It has different sized slots for your brushes, and it defintiely helps to keep them organized.</li>
    <li> I like having these for eye and lip pencils, but they are getting pricey.  I wanted to buy for some friends, but the price has just gotten to high.  I like to keep things organized and find that I mix up colors (instead of wearing the same makeup colors all the time) when they are organized.  I just grab a flower cube of a color and mix the shades for a new look that day.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with the size. Smaller than a shot glass. Doesn&#x27;t hold up any of my brushes!</li>
    <li> A lot smaller than i anticipated.  It does the job but I was picturing something a little more high quality.</li>
    <li> Its okay but even after reading other reviews i still bought it. Its really too small for what i expected. Fast service though.</li>
    <li> Great for brushes, pencils, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s MUCH smaller than I thought and was about to send it back.  Then I read the other reviews and realized I hadn&#x27;t looked at the size.  I thought I would give it a try first - and viola!  Everything fits perfectly, even my long handled brushes.  I have about 12 brushes and 8 eye pencils in it.  The brushes fan out because it&#x27;s short, but that works for me.  Previously, I had them all in a very pretty glass cyclinder and it was hard to find things.  Not so here.  The short design just works.</li>
    <li> According to the picture on Amazon I was getting a more deep brush holder. When it arrived it was shallow and the tiny holes for brushes barely fit my eye shadow brushes. The brushes are standing correctly, but I was expecting more.</li>
