<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Simple to replace! Love the product used nightly.</li>
    <li> It works perfect with my Waterpik.  The hose wears out every so often, so it is great I don&#x27;t have to buy the whole new set.</li>
    <li> Easy to install, perfect replacement. My Waterpik works like new again.</li>
    <li> My Waterpik handle was leaking. The kit was reasonably priced.The kit had clear instructions, and it was easy to replace!</li>
    <li> The replacement part was a perfect fit and was able to repair my Waterpik for $15 for replacing the whole thing for $69.</li>
    <li> perfect, it is the right replacement part, easy to assemble and replace.  why buy anything else, its the right part for this product</li>
    <li> It was the right fit and the shipping time was excellent.  I looked in alot of stores to buy this part and nobody carries this item.  So thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Rather than buy a new Waterpik, we purchased the part we needed.  The merchant shipped reasonably quickly.  The part was a snap to replace and fit perfectly.  Waterpik good as new for $8 instead of buying a new one. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> The replacement unit is a bit expensive,  but it is easy to replace and the waterpik is like new again.  The hose will eventually break after prolonged use so it has to be replaced. It&#x27;s good that they sell just this piece.</li>
    <li> When the old tubing on my WaterPik cracked from old age I priced new WaterPiks around $50 and didn&#x27;t want to spend that much. While searching on line I saw the repair kit and thought it was worth a shot. I swapped out the old handle and tubing in seconds with a screwdriver. Now it works great, and I&#x27;m not adding something that still works fine to a landfill.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be lazy and buy a whole new Water Pic, this is easy to install.</li>
    <li> easy install. works fine</li>
    <li> I bought this kit based on a review I read on Amazon. I ordered the product, figuring I could return it if need be. I installed the handle assembly immediately upon receipt. I was impressed to find that had four of the screws used to attach the handle. I was able to use the ones already on my waterpik. The package also contained s spare flutter valve if my present one was broken, but that was ok on my unit. The directions were clear and thorough, and as the prior reviewer had said, it was a piece of cake to install. Works great and my teeth are much happier now that I&#x27;ve got the unit fixed.</li>
    <li> AWSOME! I NEVER KNEW,THIS WAS EVERYTHING I NEEDED</li>
    <li> My Waterpik replacement hose and handle arrived ahead of schedule.  It was very easy to install and functions perfectly. The best part was the cost.</li>
    <li> All arrived as I expected. I will be back to order 4 more in two years.</li>
    <li> is exactly right but how it does not have the same length of the original,, (it&#x27;s a little shorter)</li>
    <li> The hose near the handle cracked twice causing it to leak and became inoperative since  I purchased it. I had to replace it twice.It should be reinforced.  also , I had to replace the neoprene valve at the bottom of the water container several times due to water leaking during the re-filling process.  The last replacement valve only holds water when I re-fill if I first press down on the valve before filling with water.Aside from the above, it does its job well and I don&#x27;t want to be without it.&lt;br /&gt;  Doris and Al Silverman  (aldorjg@comcast.net)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I hope you can improve the design to eliminate these problems.</li>
    <li> That darn Waterpik hose is always the first to go. Until now, our only option was to throw away a perfectly good machine for want of a 2-bit piece of plastic piping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has changed all that! It takes seconds to take out the old assembly and instal this replacement. It works perfectly - and I truly cannot understand those who claim to have difficulty fitting it.</li>
    <li> My review is strictly meant to help others who are having difficulty attempting to replace the handle assembly including the hose. I purchased the identical kit directly from the Waterpik-Store for $8.99 plus P&amp;H total $12.94. However, the item shown is the same thing. Very easy installation/replacement. This chore was completed in approximately 10 minutes. My unit is WP-100&lt;br /&gt;When reading other reviews I noted another member who suggested using the Waterpik Store as well. Good Luck</li>
    <li> This kit comes with the handle, a reed valve and two screws.  The reed valve is straight on one side and that matches up with a straight section in the base.  Plumber&#x27;s silicone on the o-ring makes it go into the base a little easier.  The leak is fixed.</li>
    <li> My water pic works like new now</li>
    <li> This is my second replacement for my Waterpik. They last for about a year and significantly extends the life of the whole device, no need to buy another unit.</li>
    <li> The plastic hose at the base of the handle broke off - not good - water everywhere!!!  Bought this to replace, works great; it&#x27;s a plug and play replacement for the original. Took 2 minutes to install, and we&#x27;re back to good dental hygiene.</li>
    <li> Good solution for a problem with my Waterpik.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm for replacement.  Brought my water pic back to new.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement handle assembly for an older Waterpik unit. Our old unit&#x27;s plastic hose finally broke. This replacement hose fit perfectly, installed easily, and works like a champ. Saved a lot of $$money$$ over buying a new unit by replacing the hose only.  The hose has a rubber seal already installed and mounts easily with two screws on the bottom of the unit. The hardest part was digging through the drawer to find the screwdriver. There is a fundamental design flaw with these, however, as Waterpik uses fairly rigid plastic to make these coiled hoses. Constantly stretching the hose back and forth between using it and storing it in the holder on the unit puts stress on the plastic hose. It finally became brittle and broke. Perhaps using a more flexible plastic would fix this, as in the past we used the old Waterpik units and I never remember a hose leaking or breaking. The pump usually went out after twenty years of use. This hose broke in about six years of daily use. On the upside ? Less expensive to replace than buying a new Waterpik and installed easily. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This assembly is easy to install. My old one had sprung a leak. It just took minutes to switch them out.</li>
    <li> it fitted perfectly on my flosser&lt;br /&gt;good price&lt;br /&gt;fast delivery</li>
    <li> just what the doctor ordered</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and product works as a champ.</li>
    <li> Original tools always work well.</li>
    <li> Fixed my Waterpik! Saved me from having to buy a whole new Waterpik.</li>
    <li> Replaced the handle assembly and now works as new</li>
    <li> replace previous head that I have used for five years.&lt;br /&gt;WORKS WELL&lt;br /&gt;Good alternative to floss. either pick or tape.</li>
    <li> The original handle assembly failed because the hose separated.  The replacement hose was received promptly and was well packaged. It was easy to install and works as well as the original did before the hose failure.</li>
    <li> It was perfect. Easy to replace.</li>
    <li> A snap to fix. Works well. Hope it will last at least the three years that the original model did :)</li>
    <li> One modified jet to allow full flow to clean my sinuses works perfectly. Any other jet is pushed forward by the water pressure and leaks profusely. My advise: Don&#x27;t waste your money. Instead use it to help you buy a new waterpik.</li>
    <li> The item solved my poorly performing water-pik,  I saved money, not having to purchase an entirely new product,  I was able to purchase the correct repair item, not the whole system</li>
    <li> Designed poorly by Waterpik as failures are imminent.</li>
    <li> This fixed it.  My previous cord broke and this was the perfect replacement.</li>
    <li> I bought the Waterpik WP-100 a little over 2 years ago and use it regularly except when I&#x27;m travelling. Within a few months the pause button started sticking and later it leaked. I should have taken it back to where I bought it immediately and exchanged it. Instead I contacted Waterpik and they sent me a new handle. But that took a long time and the whole unit went out of warranty. Since then I have bought 2 handles. After about 6 months the pause button sticks again and will not release until the unit is turned off and sits for awhile. It is a bad design. Why Waterpik does not fix the problem is beyond me. They must do a return-on-investment calculation and determine that they can make more profit by not fixing it. If enough people read these reviews and stop buying Waterpiks maybe they will get the point and improve the design.</li>
    <li> It worked great was very easy to install, and my water pik is as good as new, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Easy to install - READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!! There&#x27;s a little valve you should replace that comes with it, that is easy to miss. The handle is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble and works great. Haven&#x27;t had a cavity in 30 years using my water pic. Before that I had gingivitis and since then no gingivitis.</li>
    <li> Installed fine. Works good.</li>
    <li> This replacement handle is perfect for the extension of life for the waterpick unit. Easy to install; could not tell that a replacement handle was installed. Installation was less than 2 minutes. After installing their was no leaks; my water pick now performs as it did when first purchased.</li>
    <li> Very easy and quick to connect. Works perfectly. As expected for an assembly kit, in addition it cames with all the spare parts for a total replacement.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, perfect replacement OE handle for WP-100 WaterPik. Easy to replace a broken handle - remove the 2 screws holding the water line to the base of the WaterPik, pull out tthe plug and remove the handle and line. Remove reed valve from inside the socket in the base of the housing. Install included new reed valve, plug in new handle and install the new included screws. A 5 minute job.</li>
    <li> The hose on my waterpic split, so I needed a replacement.  All it took was loosening two screws and inserting the new unit.  Well worth the price</li>
    <li> As advertised, this replacement part was easy to install. Saved having to throw out the whole unit. But easy availability of replaceable part and the clarity of the accompanying directions  suggest that this is a frequent problem and therefore that  the unit design is flawed. Makes me think the replacement part should be heavily discounted, if not free. Oh well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad that I bought the replacement part.  I had my waterpick for many years when the plastic hose broke.  The handle Assembly kit works just fine.  I&#x27;m happy that I didn&#x27;t have to buy a brand new water pick. It&#x27;s hard to write a great review  over a handle assembly kit.  I&#x27;m tired, it&#x27;s hot  in Florida.</li>
    <li> The replacement part was perfect. Easy to connect and works great.</li>
    <li> Love my Waterpik. Can&#x27;t live without it. When the hose split, I was going to buy the new model, but after reading all the reviews, decided to replace the nozzle on my old one because it is the one everyone commented was the better one. At the price I paid, it works like new and am very happy. Got it quickly, too.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply. Works fine.</li>
    <li> I ordered but found that was not the problem.  So I&#x27;ll save for whenever it breaks as it has before</li>
    <li> Our water pik brushes would not stay on, and my daughter just got her braces. THis was extremely easy to replace. Now the waterpik is like new.</li>
    <li> Good replacement. Came with all the necessary parts. A little pricey considering it&#x27;s almost half the price of a new waterpik. Four stars instead of five because of the price. Some people might be tempted to buy a new waterpik (as I was) which is really a waste.</li>
    <li> shpping is fast. it&#x27;s good</li>
    <li> I needed this product soon, and contacted the seller via email on a sunday. i indicated i needed this item to be shipped on Monday.  they replied early that monday indicating that the item had been shipped  This is great service, a 5 star for them.  the product was easy to install and a lot cheaper than buying a new waterpic</li>
    <li> Original coiled hose from the unit to the handle cracked. This is a perfect replacement. The only thing is seating the new gasket O ring in the base unit, not hard but it&#x27;s tiny and could be crushed if not done right the first time.</li>
    <li> All right, I recommend.</li>
    <li> now I can use my pick for another 10 yeears</li>
    <li> Very easy to install and works perfectly</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> So happy to have found a repair kit. Now the old Waterpik (at least 15 years old) works again.</li>
    <li> It fit perfectly and was very  easy to install. I hope it will be available if I need another replacement</li>
    <li> I love the new handle,it was very easy to install,saves you from replacing the entire waterpik!!!! I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Simple replacement for the original handle on which the feed tube had gotten brittle and broken. Always question why repair parts invariably require a whole assembly when you only need a gasket or a tube, and consequently, why you have to pay too much, but the part does what it was designed to do. Installation was straight forward; not complicated. Saved having to replace the entire unit which would have cost even more.</li>
    <li> A perfect replacement for mine that broke. I always check amazon s prices ad compare to others online for prices</li>
    <li> My wife and I have been using our waterpik regularly for about a year now, but unfortunately our original handle went bad.   The button that holds the water would get stuck.      Rather than buying a new waterpik for $50, I found these on amazon and ended up picking up 3, in the event that they typically only have life of one year.  The handles arrived as expected and with no problems. It is very simple to install. It is unfortunate that they start to go bad after a year though.</li>
    <li> The button on my year-old handle was stuck.  This was easy to install and my unit is good as new.  Just unscrew two screws and plug it and secure it.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Easy to install on my water pick and very reasonable.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Replacement kit easy to replace the existing unit; . and saves having to buy a complete unit,  and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> The original waterpik tubing is a bit brittle and eventually broke. The replacement works but don&#x27;t try to push the hose portion on to the old nozzle at the pump as it will be almost impossible. Simply cut the tube from near the pump,allowing enough hose, and slide the new hose with fitting on that part of the remaining hose. Disassembling and reassembling of the unit is not easy and alining the outer shell to the main body is not easy so if you don&#x27;t feel competent or are not good with tools, do not try this repair. Otherwise it&#x27;s a good repair if you do not want to spend the money on a new unit. We like to repair things around here rather than throw them out and buy a new one which may or may not hold up.</li>
    <li> I broke the hose on my machine and wasn&#x27;t real thrilled with the prospect of spending the money on a whole new unit, so I tried to snip and splice my split hose. Don&#x27;t waist your time! My repair still leaked (though it worked) and any water left in the tank after I was finished bled over the counter over a short time. This new replacement handle was a breeze to install and works like the original (no runs, no drips, no errs).</li>
    <li> mine lasted 2 years.then i got a  bit slack and discovered black mold.i soaked it in hydrogen peroxide and it was dead next time i tried to use it. tip would not lock in.i pulled the cap and spring found more mold.now its been like 5 days and broke down for xpress UPS ended up paying 26.95. still cheaper than a new one.now my resevior is weird from putting mouthwash and peroxide mix in ut/i opened the assembly up and it look pretty clean inside except for some mineral scale on the tube connection point.</li>
    <li> bought repair kit before and like to have extra&#x27;s when needed</li>
    <li> The installation was straightforward. But after just a few month of installing it, the hose is showing signs of failure.</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.  Price was low and installation easy.  I wish Waterpik made a hose without having to replace the entire handle as mine was working fine but overall this did the job.</li>
    <li> This is an exact replacement for the original handle. The installation is very easy, requiring removing two screws to pull the old handle out, then popping the new unit in and replacing the screws. This was a good opportunity to give the area a good cleaning too. We are set for the next couple of years.</li>
    <li> easy to install.  it saved me from buying a new system just for one broken cord.  did I say it&#x27;s easy to install?</li>
    <li> I through two waterpik&#x27;s away because the 1/8&amp;#34; water line broke. My last one the handle broke and then I found these replacement handles.&lt;br /&gt;It took two minutes to install and it works great. A lot cheaper than buying a $60.00 new one</li>
    <li> I was so glad to get this, rather than replacing the whole Waterpik. It was easy to install. It is much more environmentally friendly and economical to replace this part, rather than the whole unit which is still perfectly good.</li>
    <li> So happy to replace a small piece of a working waterpik instead of buying a new one. The handle assembly is the weakest part of the whole. Had another one spring a leak and we bought a whole new machine.</li>
    <li> worked great - easy install - thought I would have to buy a whole new unit</li>
    <li> The replacement part was defective and did not work.  We returned it, and our refund was prompt, with all out-of-pocket costs covered.  We subsequently purchased a new unit.  Our other experiences with Amazon purchases have been excellent, and we continue to value their excellent business practices.  It is important to realize Amazon does not manufacture the products they distribute, and they make sure their customers are not harmed in any way when a product is purchased that is less than perfect.</li>
    <li> My Waterpik works better than NEW!!!!!! Thank You!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works as expected.  Easy to install.  Comes with replacement valve</li>
    <li> A simple and relatively cheap replacement part that restores my Waterpik .  Replacement involves just two screws, pulling out the old assembly, and pushing the new one in.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Works great and was easy to install. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Yes, it fit my waterpik as promised and installation was simple.</li>
    <li> I appreciate my water pic very much.  I use the pic at least twice daily AND ANY TIME I HAVE DEBRIS CAUGHT IN MY TEETH.</li>
    <li> Exactly as I expected.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement part for my waterpik.  Fit well and fixed it! Yay.</li>
    <li> This piece works less than a year when used once daily. The button starts malfunctioning: after pressing it down, it gets stuck and no water goes through. It takes lots of fiddling with the button and on/off switch on the machine itself to get it going again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the quality of the product is not very good. I have ordered two replacements already. It takes time to order and receive these guys. Besides, they are costly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am looking for another brand. This one is pretty annoying.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, for Amazon.com; I was abel to aquire this same product from the Waterpik web site for $8.99+3.00 shipping. It does work and perform like the orginal. It is great to be able to get competive priced items. With that said, Amazon, still prove at a great price many items and products I like. I give it only 4 stars due to the price.</li>
    <li> As the water pik is not a cheat product, I love it and has worked for years.  This was my second unit, even bought a kids one for grand daughter.  When wand tubing leaked and broke I was most disappointed, then over  joyed to find replacement tubing.  Was very easy to install new one.</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than buying new Waterpik! It&#x27;s my second replacement handle and I don&#x27;t mind spending another $16 since I use it quite a lot. Previous handle lasted for two years and I consider it a good run given such extensive use.&lt;br /&gt;Replacing is easy, anybody with a screwdriver can do it.&lt;br /&gt;Word of advice - don&#x27;t throw out your older handle, you might be able to fix it later using the parts from another one. Even though it;s glued and you will have to crack it along the body, you can easily put it back together with a superglue</li>
    <li> We like the WP-100, but this part is the weakest link of the product. Actually, you could order the replacement part from Waterpik&#x27;s website at a lower cost than Amazon.</li>
    <li> I am so happy you had this ,I would have had to by a new one. This was a great service.</li>
    <li> Got it in 3 - 4 days.  Works fine.</li>
    <li> This is perfect, i am glad we can get spare parts like this and not go replace the whole unit.</li>
    <li> It was easy to install the replacement handle but once I tried to use it I realized that it did not emit a stream that was as strong as the original.  The handle is very leaky and so the pressure coming out of it is low.  I purchased two of these handles thinking that the first one might be defective so I installed the second handle but got the same results.  The price of these two terrible handles plus the shipping brought me half way to the price of purchasing a whole new unit which I had orginally intended to do.  Oh well live and learn.</li>
    <li> After researching the cost of replacing my six-year-old WaterPik Flosser/Irrigator, I was able to replace the leaking hose for just one-fourth the cost - an easy repair, and the unit is good as new!</li>
    <li> Arived on time.  As advertised.</li>
    <li> Great. Save a lot of money. And save more environmental waste by keeping a machine going for more years.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Not much more to say.</li>
    <li> Love the waterpik. People should use this product really.</li>
    <li> This works great. It was very easy to install. Better to replace the part than throw the whole thing away.</li>
    <li> It saved me from having to buy another Waterpik, which is expensive.  It&#x27;s easy too install and the delivery is expedient.</li>
    <li> The Waterpik WP-100 Handle Assembly Kit  came assembled and was very easy to install.  I removed two screws which allowed me to remove the old hose assembly.  I put the new hose assembly in place and put the two screw back in place. Presto, it was ready to go.  It does not get any easier than this.</li>
    <li> This waterpik handle was easy to install.  Shipping was fast and the  directions were clearly written. This is a well made product.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of these because none of my waterpik attachments were clicking in place, making the device useless. Installed purchase, and   (1) while several attachments now  can be installed securely, the one attachmen I use still cannot click in place.   (2) Product was also supposed to fix water jet problem whereby some water exits around rather than through attachments. Product has done nothing to correct this either.   (3) Very dissapointed as product does not do what it claims.   (4) Also shipment was delayed for no apparent reason for 2 weeks and when I emailed seller, I got no response. So non-existent customer service problem from seller itself.</li>
    <li> For some reason it doesn&#x27;t have the pressure of the other handle, but it was easy to install and works fine.  I am glad I bought from a small company on Amazon.  Fast delivery was great.</li>
    <li> Quick shipment, fine quality.  Only I hope the tube could be longer!  I want to order more accessories or different model</li>
    <li> The handle and tube was easy to install and works perfect . It kept me from having to buy a complete new Waterpik .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red</li>
    <li> This was an exact replacment for the waterpik I have. Smiple installation and worked like it is suppose to work.</li>
    <li> Very easy to install.  Plastic products will age and fail, mostly when you lift and move the tube, so it is better to change all the handle instead of try to repair the old tube when it breaks.  Buying two kits is not a good idea because the plastic of the second kit will age, without use. This kit will make more years of use to my Waterpik.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than buying a new one.  Easy to install.</li>
    <li> The seller got the product to me very quickly. The merchandize was exactly what I needed. Replacing the handle kit was easy and simple and best of all it worked like the original part. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This item plugged right into my Waterpik unit and works like new.</li>
    <li> I was able to replace my old cord, that had a leak, in no time at all. It saved me from having to purchase a new flosser.</li>
    <li> Love it, but the original hose should not have broken so quickly. This replacement has already lasted longer than the original. Best not to stretch these hoses any more than necessary when using them, as the combination of vibration &amp; the hose&#x27;s brittleness (especially with age) will break them.</li>
    <li> This item saved me the cost of buying a new water pic.  It is easy to install and economically priced.</li>
    <li> Worked great. Simple to install. Good as new!</li>
    <li> This product satisfied all my expectations: very functional and good quality. It is also very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Really useful item in good condition.</li>
    <li> fast delivery and works perfect, glad they have spare parts for this waterpik</li>
    <li> Easy to install, never would know it wasn&#x27;t the original handle.</li>
    <li> Easy to change it out and saved me from having to purchase a whole new unit.  The tube broke on my existing waterpik.  I tried opening the handle and cutting down the cord based on a Youtube video I saw.  The handle is glued together so you need to do a controlled break.  Regardless, the tube broke again quickly so I was about to give up and purchase a new waterpik when I came across this part.  I have been using for a month or two with no issues.</li>
    <li> When the handle for my Waterpik snapped off the tube, I was prepared to throw out the entire machine and purchase a new one.  I was surprised to find that the replacement part was readily available on Amazon.  \&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two phillips head screws hold the tube in place.  Removing them, pulling out the old busted part, inserting the new one and tightening the screw back down took about a minute.  It doesn&#x27;t leak and works as good as new....anyone with a screwdriver can do this repair.</li>
    <li> I Loved it, quick shipping, product as described, works perfectly. Recommend it to any other buyer, looking for this kind of quality product</li>
    <li> It is easy to install and quite cost effective! It is much better than having to replace the entire unit.</li>
    <li> This kit was easy to install and it works just like the original.  I&#x27;ll order it again if I need a new one</li>
    <li> Perfect as it looks like I got the original product made by Waterpik and not a replacement.. Hope it last as long as the original product which lasted for 5 years.</li>
    <li> This is a part that needs to be replaced from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this replacement part and installed it on the Water Pik&lt;br /&gt;and it works exactly as it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> The handle is just like the original and it went together very easy. I only took 5 minutes to have back in perfect order with a philips head screw driver. Its like the break never happened.</li>
    <li> This handle is working fine now that it&#x27;s replaced.  The fact that you even have to replace it is absurd.  So,we&#x27;ll see how long this one lasts.  I don&#x27;t think I would buy this waterpik again....the whole package.  Made in China.....lasts like it&#x27;s made in China.</li>
    <li> Product was as expected and worked well</li>
    <li> Smooth Transaction  Rate AAA+++</li>
    <li> Made my waterpik work like new again - the button on the handle had stuck &amp;#34;in&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This new handle was very easy to install.  The handle assembly is identical to the original product so it is just like new again. I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I was glad I could find a replacement for my Water Pic, the pump worked good, the hose cracked from ware</li>
    <li> Hose broke and I would have to buy a new water pick if I could not get this kit.  Easy to install and makes water pick work as good as new.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for factory original. Looks identical and took about 3 minutes to change out.</li>
    <li> saved me from buying a new waterpik</li>
    <li> WaterPik makes a very helpful dental device. Just don&#x27;t push on the rotating part of the handle too hard as this will probably break over time. There is just  a very thin plastic washer holding the whole thing together as I found out when the first one fell apart.</li>
    <li> OMG, this is perfect. I think its better than when I first got the waterpik.  My handle was leaking badly and the momentary pause button would stick and would not release.  It took less than 5 minutes and a small screwdriver to install. It is now easy to put the tips in and out, too.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this part rather than replacing the entire unit.</li>
    <li> Very Happy that this part was available. Ive had my original for about 4 years befor the hose cracked.  Did not want to buy a whole new Water-Pik</li>
    <li> Do not over tighten screws or you will have to replace the new handle assembly, snug them only, It has a o-ring that keeps it from leaking, again do not over tighten they are plastic threads.</li>
    <li> So easy to replace the old leaky handle. Just breezed right through it, and saved a lot of money as well, versus buying a whole new unit.</li>
    <li> Buying parts is better than replacing the whole unit.  Came with screws and instructions. Works like new and looks good too.</li>
    <li> It can&#x27;t be more simple.  It fit and it was easy to install and it worked.  Yea Waterpik!</li>
    <li> After years of use, the hose on my Waterpik broke. I thought I&#x27;d have to buy a whole new unit, but instead I just replaced the handle and I&#x27;m happy again.</li>
    <li> was a perfect replacement for my waterpik wp -100,at a great price and was delivered on time .would do it again when needed.</li>
    <li> For the longest time, I had a problem with my waterpik.  When I pressed the pause button, it would stick until I turned the unit off and back on again.  It made the unit VERY difficult to use with any efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even wrote to WaterPik several months ago, asking them what the problem was and they told me to replace the wand. Dummy me, I didn&#x27;t think they were right because if the pressure setting was high enough, I could actually hear the pump inside the unit stop turning.  So I didn&#x27;t want to waste a few bucks on a new wand only to have to replace the whole unit anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, what do you know, they were right, and now i can have it all the way up on 10, hold the pause button, let it go, and it sprays again.  I wish I would have listened to WaterPik months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to anyone out there having the same problem I described above, don&#x27;t think about it any longer, just buy it and replace it.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It is easily installed and works well. Who needs a toothbrush, anyway? That&#x27;s just water under the bridge which I don&#x27;t have!</li>
    <li> installed it in minutes....great replacement....works great..saved me fromhaving to buy new WP.  will buy another if necessary..now WP is as good as new</li>
    <li> This was a great and inexpensive replacement part for my waterpik flosser - I have been very satisfied so far</li>
    <li> I dreaded getting something that would be a pain to install, but I did not want to buy a new water pick.  As it turned out, it was extremely easy to install and worked perfectly.  Like having a brand new Waterpik.  Yeah!</li>
    <li> Good replacement.  A lot cheaper than buying a whole new Waterpik.  And they are a perfect fit and really easy to install.</li>
    <li> My old cord was cracked and leaking so I found and bought this replacement - it worked perfectly and was less than $10.</li>
    <li> product exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Changed out my stuck handle with one from this kit. Took me all of 5 minutes. Good as new now.</li>
    <li> Had to replace the hand assembly because of a hole in the tubing.  It was easy to replace and my unit is now working great.</li>
    <li> Easy to install, just like new now.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and works as advertized</li>
    <li> We used the WP-100 for 4 years and one day it broke. We found it was the problem of the hose material, the manufacturer should use better material so it could last longer than 5 years.</li>
    <li> It was easy to replace.  I even did it myself.  Works perfectly.  I would highly recommend it before buying a brand new unit.  (My cat made a whole in the original one.)</li>
    <li> All models of the Water Pik  that I have owned eventually are trashed because the hose develops a leak. But unlike previous models of the Water Pik. the new ones have been built to allow for replacement of the hose. It is replaced with this &amp;#34;Handle Assembly Kit&amp;#34; in less than five minutes. Two screws on the bottom are loosened and this new hose replaces it. The hardest part might be finding a tiny screw driver for the job.</li>
    <li> It was a pleasant surprise to find out that the Waterpik&#x27;s hose and handle are replaceable.  The WP-100 handle assembly kit arrived quickly and was very simple to install.  It saved the Waterpik.  I&#x27;d go with five stars if a new nozzle was included with the handle.  I&#x27;d pay an extra buck or two for a new nozzle to be included.  The WP-100 kit is a good part for a great product.</li>
    <li> Had my WP-100 for about a year and the water flow control button on the handle was sticking. I have noticed many of the negative reviews listed this as the problem. I found a quick fix: Spray WD-40 into the groove around the flow control button. Then, with the water power switch off, press the button a number of times and listen for a light click in the handle following each time the button is pressed. If there is no click the valve is still stuck. Keep clicking until you hear the clicks. Then fill the water tank and turn on the power. Then click the handle button until the flow comes on with each click. There was only a very slight taste of WD-40 in the water for a short time after I did this. Don&#x27;t worry about the WD-40 in the water; it is not toxic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the problem is hard water that deposits grit on the valve and the WD-40 removes it. Give it a try before yo buy a new one.</li>
    <li> It arrived as stated and the installation was fast and easy.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Packaged well. Shipped fast. Very good value.</li>
    <li> SIMPLE TO INSTALL, EVEN I COULD DO IT.</li>
    <li> It was easy to repair my Waterpik and saved myself from buying a new one.  So happy I found these replacement parts for this product!</li>
    <li> just got it ..fast service..great product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the water pik and was annoyed when my unit seemed to give up the ghost after only one year of operation (I will admit to using it twice or 3 times a day) but it should have lasted longer.  I could  not figure it out-I could hear the pump was working but no water pressure at the business end.  I took it all apart- big mistake- there are some rubber bumpers, probably used to minimize the vibration of the unit on the counter that I could not reinstall to factory specs but I did manage to force it back together.  I decided to take a chance and ordered this modestly priced hose repair unit.  It installed easily- 2 screws to remove to pull the old one off and then two screws to reinstall.  It works great!! Five stars +.  A close inspection of the faulty unit showed the jet tip had broken off at the base (inside the wand) making it impossible to get a good seal, hence no water pressure.</li>
    <li> This device was broken on my Water Pik unit. It worked so well. It was easy to change and repair.</li>
    <li> For my wife.  Old one just wore out.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to buy the whole machine!  Easy to replace.</li>
    <li> Very easy to change, took about 1 minute.  Fixed the problem with the hold button on my old handle.</li>
    <li> The shipping was so fast and nice price.&lt;br /&gt;I really need the Waterpik every day, that&#x27;s why I was so glad to get only the parts of them.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly and works as expected.  Saves buying a complete new unit.  I love the water pik as it is better than flossing for getting food particles out.</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectations!!!!  It actually made my teeth turn  into diamonds!  Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> My other one dropped in the sink and the tips no longer stayed in so I was glad to find this and it is very easy to replace and saved ALOT of money.</li>
    <li> Before you purchase this, double check that you really need it.  My Waterpik handle was leaking badly, probably more water leaking out the bottom than was going through the nozzle, so I bought a new handle. To my dismay, the new handle leaked exactly as much as the old one.  That&#x27;s when I discovered that the click-in nozzle was cracked at the base. I put in another nozzle, and presto -- no more leak.  Oops!  It would cost me more to return the handle than I paid for it (I&#x27;m in Mexico), so I&#x27;ll keep it as a spare.  Who knows, maybe I&#x27;ll need it some day.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised,&lt;br /&gt;like having a new Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;Yes I would recommend it to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was very easy to put together.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> Does the job and beats buying a whole other machine. However, I do suggest doing online research as to the best price, because the amazon one can be a bit high.</li>
    <li> VERY EASY TO INSTALL/ATTACH AND A PERFECT FIT!  MUCH BETTER THAN HAVING TO PURCHASE A NEW WATERPIK.  THANK YOU FOR MAKING AVAILABLE!!</li>
    <li> Very happy that the hose and handle replacement was available so that I didn&#x27;t have to purchase the entire unit.  The replacement was very easy to install and is working fine.</li>
    <li> Received this in record time, easily unscrewed broken hose and attached the new one.  The unit works perfectly.  I was mostly impressed by how quickly I received the order. BTW Waterpik is a great product for good dental health.</li>
    <li> I have used my original Waterpik forever and finally wore out the hose. A bubble developed in the hose and it finally sprung a massive leak. As I was about to throw the whole assembly away  I decided to check on Amazon for a replacement part. Found the Handle Assembly Kit, installed it less than a minute and now have a perfect Waterpik. Love it, better than the original! Highly recommend this replacement part.</li>
    <li> It was easy to install and convenience is greater than the original.  They have improved the button, release etc it prevented us from having to purchase a new unit.</li>
    <li> The handle was easy to install and the unit is just like new again. I was going to just order a new unit but the handle saved the day!</li>
    <li> Replacement handle was very easy to install, much cheaper than buying a new Waterpik when the hose fails.  Howerer, this is the Second time I had to replace the handle assembly due to the hose cracking near the base of the handle.  Expected lifetime seems to be about 2 years.</li>
    <li> It takes precisely 2 minutes to install this (undo 2 screws, remove, insert, tighten 2 screws).  The new handle looks identical to the old one, which is both good and bad.  Good because it fits into the holder on the WaterPic perfectly.  Bad because the hose will probably break again a year down the road :-(</li>
    <li> Replaced worn leaky hose. Looks and works as well as original.  No more leaks, easily attached, comes with replacement screws and good instructions.</li>
    <li> Arrived in perfect condition. Instructions were brief and to the point.  Good pictures to confirm removal method for old handle and installation method for the new handle.  Everything worked as advertised, and I saved about $80  over buying a new Waterpik!</li>
    <li> The Handle Assembly Kit went back together in the waterpick without a problem.  It was super easy and it works like a charm.  Also the plastic water hose has a smaller coil diameter then the original so it returns to Waterpick Housing without me having to push it in everything like before.  Oh yes and it saved be from having to buy a whole new replacement waterpick.</li>
    <li> I almost bought a entire new Waterpik until I thought about looking for a replacement handle assembly. This one was very easy to install and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> When the hose from my Waterpik Ultra WP-100 unit, to the handle tore and began leaking, I was dismayed at the thought that I would have to buy a whole new device. But I was able to find this original part and when I attached it to the unit, the handle assembly fit perfectly! I was a little worried because my device was listed as &amp;#34;Ultra WP-100&amp;#34; but it was the right handle. The company even included information about a replacement valve kit. The new part arrived in less than a week. I highly recommend you look into this if your handle assembly breaks.</li>
    <li> When the handle of my Waterpik stopped working, I thought I had to buy another Waterpik.  I was really glad to see this handle for sale for such a low price. I was actually kind of skeptical that it would work.  However, it works just as good as the old one and was really easy to put in.  It does come with the hose attached, which is good since it was the hose that broke on my old one.  I&#x27;m really glad to have this.  Even if I have to replace it every few years or more, it&#x27;s still a good deal and a lot cheaper than buying new Waterpiks.</li>
    <li> It is the same as the original and works just like it.  Easy to install.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all I can say.</li>
    <li> excellent just what I needed. came very fast, 3 days.</li>
    <li> I have this Waterpik WP-100 machine for quite a while.  The handle is connected to the machine via a plastic hose and that is usually the one that is worn-out pretty quick.  My hose was slit/crack at the end of the handle and I thought I will never use the machine again until I searched Amazon then found this product.  I ordered it and it was almost lost @ my office because the package was so small (I ordered 2pcs.).  After retrieving it I immediately installed it (installation was very easy-too easy) and now am a HAPPY user!</li>
    <li> We have used the Waterpik for only 3 months and already need to replace the handle. We foolishly did not save the purchase receipt otherwise it would be a warranty claim. Evenso, we are very disappointed with the lack of quality in the handle assembly. It is cheap plastic, the on/off button sticks and the tip locking mechanism broke making it impossible to lock the tip in. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> When I melted the tube for my water pic I thought I would have to purchase a new device. Problem solved the replacement part Is great!</li>
    <li> It replace my other one that wore out I love it it works great</li>
    <li> Easy to install and keeps the old Waterpik going.</li>
    <li> Good deal fast shipping - Save me money.</li>
    <li> I thought I would have to replace my entire Waterpik when the water tube failed.&lt;br /&gt;Came across this kit and saved a bundle.  It arrived in quick order and was a snap to install.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Actually threw away a SECOND water pik after the hose busted and thought let&#x27;s checking it out on Amazon, and sure enough to find this item. Easy to replace and save big bucks vs buying a new one. Thanks!</li>
    <li> A very good quality product, which was easy to use, at a great price.  Recommend it to anyone looking to purchase a water pick.</li>
    <li> This is a repair part.  It works perfectly and was very easy to install.  Nothing more to say but there is a minimum number of words requirement for reviews.</li>
    <li> Easy to change works like new</li>
    <li> Even a monkey makes this easy to install. A screwdriver and average intelligence and a fix can be done in minutes.</li>
    <li> I thought I might have to buy a new Waterpik when the hose broke.  I was very happy to find that I could replace the handle/hose parts.</li>
    <li> We have had our waterpik for a few years and the original tube got a split in it. We tried taping it and gluing it but these tubes eventually just give up the ghost. This replacement took 2 seconds to put in and it works like new again. Don&#x27;t bother with the do-it-yourself fixes, just get this.</li>
    <li> It worked great. Fit perfectly.  I would certainly recommend the WP-100 Handle Assembly Kit to anyone who needs to replace their handle .</li>
    <li> I was about to buy a new water pic.  Now, it works as good as new and I saved a pile of money</li>
    <li> I was surprised when the hose broke inside the handle and couldn&#x27;t be fixed without replacing the whole handle. Granted this was more money than Waterpik wanted but it came so fast and fit perfectly that I would do it again without question.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product and excellent seller! THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> Needed a replacement and this was awesome.</li>
    <li> It is perfect part easy replacement, just 2 scress but careful with the little valve included it with the kit.</li>
    <li> If you have ever had the cord of the handle crack then you understand my rating.  The replacement is great and easy to assemble.</li>
    <li> Perfect, my husband put this on in no time and my waterpik is working fine  Great purchase.  Nice that waterpik made this available.</li>
    <li> The handle assembly kit arrived quickly and was easy to swap out with the old broken piece.  Happy kids &#x3D; happy dad!</li>
    <li> Works great!Very easy to change out. Saves you lots of money on not having to replace the whole machine. Happy</li>
    <li> i almost tossed my Waterpik until i found this replacement handle&lt;br /&gt;Could not believe how easy it was to install</li>
    <li> WORKED LIKE A DREAM ...</li>
    <li> This is the second Waterpik handle assembly that I have installed.  You only need to remove two screws, stick the new hose in place, and reinsert the screws.  It&#x27;s very easy to do and it cleared up the problems I was having with the on/off button.</li>
    <li> Works great compared to the later models that will self destruct if there is any disinfectant in the solution.  Very easy to install.</li>
    <li> With a little bit of research, I learned how easy it was to put my Waterpik back to usable condition by simply purchasing this handle kit.  Amazon had the best price; shipping was timely and it took no time at all to unscrew the old handle assembly with the split hose, and replace it with the new assembly.  Now, my Waterpik is like new!</li>
    <li> This replacement handle assembly worked perfectly.  It was very easy to install and I would definetly recommend this product to anyone needing to replace the handle/hose assembly.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace this item on my water pick.  My son ordered it for me and it worked very well.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t used or purchased this simple but excellent way to floss daily you are certainly missing out. Only one way to describe... EXCELLENT with amazing results!!</li>
    <li> thank you for having this piece available its the only weak ness the water pic has keep having this available</li>
    <li> The Waterpik was easy to install and works great.  Once again, The handle is easy to install and works great!</li>
    <li> saves on dentist visits my wife and I love it</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed and nothing more. Love that. Thought I would need a whole new waterpik, but no, they sell replacement parts. Very cool.</li>
    <li> Had to replace the wand and cord on our Waterpik WP-100. Product was delivered within a couple of days, easy to install and works perfectly. Would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I was prepared to toss my waterpik because the hose broke off at the handle base and could not be fixed. The repair item saved the unit and was not too costly.</li>
    <li> Waterpik WP-100 Handle Assembly Kit came on time and all in weel conditions. I procedd to change the kit and fix in seconds.</li>
    <li> This was the perfect item to fix our Waterpik, It was easy to install and lot better than  buying a whole new Waterpik.</li>
    <li> Really easy to assemble.  Works as good, if not better, than the original.  Much cheaper than a new unit.  Glad I discovered this.  I had been using the on/off switch to kill the water flow for about a year!</li>
    <li> was an exact replacement , the instructions are precise and all needed parts are included. would purchase this gain if needed.</li>
    <li> Simple to install. Instructions provided were reasonably good. This allowed me to continue to use my Waterpik instead of having to throw it out and buy a new device. One has to question the original design with a relatively thin tube which breaks at the point of connection. While this does not fix the design issue it does fix the device until the tube breaks again.</li>
    <li> So happy to have found this kit rather than having to replace my Waterpik.  It assembled quickly and easily and I have had no problems whatsoever with it.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it, the old Waterpik tubing get brittle over time. It cracks and leaks making a mess when you aren&#x27;t watching. There is no way to splice it, the whole handle has to be replaced.  Get this kit and you&#x27;ll keep your Waterpik working well and your bath counter dry.  easy peezy</li>
    <li> If water pick had a quality control in place, customer would not have this problem.The replacement works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best regards.</li>
    <li> My old one wore out, good price for a replacement.</li>
    <li> My wife and I use our Waterpik every night, and when the original handle started to malfunction, we were almost ready to buy a new Waterpik unit until a search of the internet turned up this WP-100 handle Assembly.  It is form-fit-function identical to the original and has restored the waterpik&#x27;s functionality.</li>
    <li> This replacement handle was easy to attach and it saved us from having to purchase a whole new Waterpik unit.</li>
    <li> Quick fix to extend life of water pic.  They should make the design so you can just change the hose without replacing the handle, which is glued together.</li>
    <li> Blue on and off button kept getting stuck after two years of use and this solved the problem. Comes with everything you need. Make sure it fits your model number.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered. Great to be able to replace a part at a savings.</li>
    <li> Excellent tool...Absolutely will save your teeth!</li>
    <li> My Waterpik hose had broken at the base and was not reparable.  I found the replacement assembly on Amazon at 1/3 the price of buying a new Waterpik.  The installation was simple and only took about 10 minutes.  It has worked flawlessly since.</li>
    <li> The button is staring to stick like the original unit did.  Overall rather disappointing.  Unfortunately, without the handle the whole unit is useless.</li>
    <li> This item solved our problem of excessive leakage around the handle of our Water Pik. Delivery was swift and exceeded our expectations.</li>
    <li> works fine, it is a good fit</li>
    <li> I received this item in 2 days. Original part much needed for my broken waterpik!  Thanks a lot!</li>
    <li> Fixed my broken waterjet cleaner.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect replacement part, well priced, a little less sturdy than the original piece but good. Certainly better than buying a new water pic.</li>
    <li> It took more time to find the correct screw driver than it did to install the Waterpik. It works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Great replacement parts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product was a perfect fit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivered timely, intact with everything needed to install and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No issues, just a happy customer:)</li>
    <li> beats buying a new one!</li>
    <li> This replacement handle installed in about one minute.  They even included the reed valve in case it is needed.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> I accidentally burned a hole in the tubing of my Waterpik so was happy to find this replacement. Very easy to install. Good instructions.I do wish there had been a less expensive replacement for just the tubing.</li>
    <li> good product, delivery on time</li>
    <li> Changed the old one out within 5 minutes. I&#x27;m mad that the original handle broke, since i had used the water pick only 20-30 times. I hope this one lasts longer.</li>
    <li> The best part about buying this replacement handle assembly was there were no surprises.  Within minutes of its arrival, the handle was installed and the Waterpik was being used.  The quality of the replacement handle appears to be equal to the one being replaced.</li>
    <li> Very inexpensive and it does it&#x27;s purpose. Easy to replace. I was back to working operations in less than 10 minutes. I&#x27;m glad I purchased this. It really saved me a lot of money getting a whole new unit.</li>

    <li> Great product.  It saved me from having to buy a new water pick. The instructions were easy to read and to put together</li>

    <li> The Waterpik handle assembly kit was just what I needed.  It arrived quickly and was easy to install, fit perfectly and was just like the original.  I would definitely buy this product again.</li>

    <li> Who would have thought that you could buy this replacement part.  I was just going to buy a whole new waterpik.  Glad I was able to save some money.  Easy to install!</li>
    <li> Saved a bunch by just replacing the handle assembly. Works fine and added another couple of years to the Waterpik purchased many years ago.</li>
    <li> Thank you! All is ok!</li>
    <li> waterpik working very well</li>
    <li> I will definitely buy from this company again.  Their service was great.  I received the replacement assembly 3 days ahead of the scheduled delivery date.  The Waterpik WP-handle assembly was exactly what I needed and it saved me a lot of money - I didn&#x27;t have to buy a new Waterpik.</li>
    <li> Worked perfect.  Easily replaced old handle. No leaks. Unscrewed the bottom. Pop into place and screwed back in. Worked perfect.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a replacement; it worked. the requirement for a lengthy review is a bit much! I may not bother next time.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than a new WaterPik, this replacement lasts for about a year.  It is easy to remove the old piece with the broken hose and replace the assembly with only a small screw driver.</li>
    <li> We have an old Waterpic and the handle broke.  We ordered this part and it&#x27;s as good as new!!  The service was very good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve using this brand for a long time, it truly work well and throughly in cleaning the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;this vender is also very conscientious and make delivery very quickly.</li>
    <li> Product allowed me to quickly repair what I thought was a lost waterpik.  Works as good as new and easy to install.  Arrived in 2 days-thank you!</li>
    <li> I love my water pic, use it religiously. Was not happy when the tubing broke as pics are a little pricy. Didn&#x27;t know I could replace the handle and was very happy to find it. Easy to replace and my pic is good as new!</li>
    <li> it fits but expensive</li>
    <li> its exactly what i needed for my waterpik without paying for a brand new machine it fits perfectly would buy again</li>
    <li> To reconnect was the easiest thing . You unscrew the piece and replace with new piece It comes with the screws and the attachment piece takes about 3 minutes</li>
    <li> was a replacement for a broken one, works fine. love it!&lt;br /&gt;I need nine more words to finish this review</li>
    <li> the handle leaked worse than the one i was attempting to replace on my original unit.</li>
    <li> After 4 years, the hose became brittle and cracked. Rather than buy a new water flosser, I checked Amazon for the replacement kit and placed my order. I received the package and repaired my Waterpik.  Simple installation. Comes as shown with instructions, a new reed-valve, and replacement screws.</li>
    <li> I received the handle assembly and it was a simple removal of 2 screws to remove the old handle assembly then fit the new one and reinstall the two new screws that came with the handle assembly. Took about 5 minutes tops!!</li>
    <li> Armed with a Phillips screwdriver, I installed this in just a few minutes.  Now we have the original functionality restored.</li>
    <li> After years of continuous use, my waterpik hose sprang a leak. Rather than buy a new unit, I just replaced the hose. Replacement was as easy as removing 2 screws. Works just like new, and all for just $10.</li>
    <li> It works well and is simple to install.</li>
    <li> I love this piece! I was going to purchase a complete Waterpik at first, then I found that amazon do sell this part. It&#x27;s easy to install and save some money instead of  replacing the whole unit.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement.  Easy to install.</li>
    <li> The weak point is the hose right near where it attaches to the handle. This is the 2nd handle we purchased for the same Waterpik. It fits well but will probably fail as well within a year.</li>
    <li> Better than the original!</li>
    <li> works well as a replacement to my waterpic that had developed a leak.</li>
    <li> Made my Waterpik good as new!  East install! Update after 2 years of going strong this puppy gave out.  Started leaking around the button causing it to be messy and lose pressure.  Debating on ordering another or a new waterpik at this point.</li>
    <li> Just right. Easy to change broken one.</li>
    <li> I received the kit very promptly and replacing the old one took only a few minutes.  I am very pleased with service and, thank you.</li>
    <li> No issues with install. About 60% strength of original handle. Used to be slightly before mid-point of dial now almost have to max it out to obtain equal strenght. Luckily it is still just barely strong enough for me.     If you are already over the half way point you may be unhappy with power of new handle.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected, saved spending $50+ on a whole new unit.</li>
    <li> Easy install and, worked as OEM!</li>
    <li> Very simple to install and works and looks just like the original. Just hoping it lasts longer without the control button sticking .</li>
    <li> A perfect-fitting replacement for my leaky Water-Pik handle.  If you can loosen a phillips head screw, and follow simple instructions, you can replace it yourself.  Very easy to do, only took 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> The WaterPik WP-100 began dribbling water around the base.  Loved the product, but hated the mess after using.  Discovered this \\&quot;replacement\\&quot; kit.  Arrived quickly and contained all the parts needed for a quick fix.  NO LEAKS and only 10% of the cost of buying a new WQaterPik.</li>
    <li> EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED AND WORKED WITHOUT A PROBLEM AND NOT RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;waffle to make up extra words blah blah</li>
    <li> I almost bought a new waterpik, but luckly I found this one while shoping amazon. Handle was easy to assemple.</li>
    <li> It was right for the job I needed to for and the price was very competitive.  Would recommend the seller for this and other produces.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  Product was EXACTLY as advertised and pictured.  Could not be more pleased!</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble. Exact replacement hose part of my original waterpik. I have used it for over a month without any issues..</li>
    <li> Got my 5 year old waterpik working like new! Easy to install too.</li>
    <li> exact replacement for an older unit that avoids buying a more costly entire waterpik. The hose that attaches will leak in time.</li>
    <li> Glad to see that they make this replacement for the Waterpik,Instead of having to buy a new waterpik everytime</li>
    <li> perfect, easy to install</li>
    <li> This part just save me from having to buy the entire unit all over again. I burned my tubing with my curling iron a few ago and could not fic the hole. Now this $16.99 purchase has given me my Water Pic back. It works great and I replaced the damaged part myself in seconds. Buy it.Got here really fast too. My teeth feel extra clean again tonight !</li>
    <li> The newer model is lacking many of the features of the older model that I had. The biggest difference is that there is no variable speed for pump. It also came without a cover in an obvious attempt to save money on mfg costs. Maybe I am spoiled by the older model, but aren&#x27;t new products supposed to be better, not worse</li>
    <li> My waterpik has been restored to perfect working condition. So glad i could buy the hose with attachment separately. The tiny washer&lt;br /&gt;needs replacing, so don&#x27;t forget or your unit will leak.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the replacement handle assembly, my Waterpik is back as it should be, working perfectly. Very easy to attach.</li>
    <li> good equipment, promptly shipped, thanks!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.  Just a little Philips screwdriver to put it in.  Original unit had plastic pipe broken at the base of the handle.  I was going to throw the unit out.  This saved it and I use it every day!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Waterpick and their service is outstanding!  I have been using a Waterpick since they first came  on the market and have only needed to purchase two in all of that time.  My second water pick was several years old when the handle suddenly broke.  I thought I would have to throw the unit away.  When I went on line looking for a replacement, I found that I could actually buy a replacement handle assembly kit.  It was reasonably priced and very easy to install.  It was shipped promptly and I even got a follow-up from customer service as to my satisfaction.  My unit is as good as new!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the part I needed to repair my water pik. It arrived quickly and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I had dropped my waterpik and had put a hole in the hose. I felt great in finding this available from Amazon recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> This item was very simple to install. The replacement part was needed for the Waterpik to work great again. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> fits  right on - two small screws.  no leaks.</li>
    <li> It was easy to unscrew the old assembly and install this. It works as advertised and even has an extra tiny gasket if needed.</li>
    <li> It fit perfectly. Was easy to replace!  Best of all, I Didn&#x27;t need to buy a new water pick. Happy that I found the spare part.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very simple to remove the old one (the tubing broke) and replace with the new part.  Sort of fool proof; removed 2 screws, take off the old handle, replace new handle and replace 2 screws.  No leaks which I feared.  I don&#x27;t have to replace my expensive water pick now, it&#x27;s been saved by this replacement part.</li>
    <li> Original equipment fit perfectly, not much else to say!</li>
    <li> Fixed the problem and we didn&#x27;t have to buy a whole new Waterpik!</li>
    <li> SAVED US FROM BUYING ANOTHER UNIT, SO MUCH CHEAPER AND VERY EASY TO INSTALL.</li>
    <li> Deliverd as stated and the product worked great.  My wife is very happy that her water pik doesn&#x27;t leak any longer.</li>
    <li> Exact fit replacement for the unit.  It also came with new screws and the small fabric valve.  This is the second time we replace this part over the last couple years.  It&#x27;s better than replacing the whole unit that still works fine.</li>
    <li> Good quality. performs as it should. Perfect fit. If you need a replacement this is the one to buy. I do recommend buying.</li>
    <li> A great way to repair a Waterpik at reasonable cost.</li>
    <li> Works just like it should. Clear instructions, well packed, fairly priced.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement item that I bought and it works well. I have no problems with it so far.</li>
    <li> I fixed the Waterflosser!! It would have cost 3 times as much to replace the Waterflosser unit.&lt;br /&gt;The hose had broken off unit. It was easy to replace!</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement part</li>
    <li> The purchase of the Waterpik Handle Assemble Kit save me the price of a totally new Waterpik.  I only hope this one lasts longer than my other one.</li>
    <li> I love it. The product was good and delivery is fast.&lt;br /&gt;My need was met with this order. I am happy.</li>
    <li> Got it fast and it was just what I needed.</li>
    <li> The vendor fulfilling and shiping this order deserves 5 stars, but I am giving only 4 stars here only because Waterpik should have done a much better job in manufacturing the original assembly so that it wouldn&#x27;t have broken in the first place.  In my opinion, the assembly hose is made by Waterpik in a way such that it inevitably breaks, thereby requiring the user to buy a new one.</li>
    <li> Super easy to attach.  Works like original did.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad someone has consideration enough to provide a part like this for a product such as a Waterpik. Due to a continuous flexing of the tubing, my original developed a week spot and began to leak to the point of being useless. Was glad to find a provider who could offer the handle assembly at a very fair price. Prevented me from having to buy another $60 unit. Product was shipped in a very timely matter, shipped correctly. No negative issues. Happy customer.</li>
    <li> Just like new again!!!  My original hose broke and I was desperately needing this hose replacement assembly kit.&lt;br /&gt;I was really missing my waterpik too.</li>
    <li> This was easy to install and saved me from replacing the whole unit just because the handle was leaking.  I was looking for a new waterpik when I found this.</li>
    <li> as described....received rapidly</li>
    <li> It was so easy to replace and works fine.  I am glad that I was able to keep my machine longer with this new parts.</li>
    <li> This saved my broken $64 Waterpik. Anybody who has one has to know about these. Repair is simple and just requires unscrewing the old and screwing in the new.</li>
    <li> Shipping was way to high...</li>
    <li> Tried many fixes before breaking down and buying this.  The pressure is too high to just &amp;#34;rig it&amp;#34; for awhile.  Very simple to remove the old one and replace with this one.  I can not remember when I purchased this, but it is at least more than a year now, and no problems.</li>
    <li> Part arrived quickly and installation a snap!</li>
    <li> installed easily and worked fine.</li>
    <li> This is the second handle assembled I have had to buy.  The first one&#x27;s handle just fell into two pieces, the second one&#x27;s hose sprung a leak!</li>
    <li> Works great,good replacement part.</li>
    <li> Perfect good, and quality.</li>
    <li> very easy to install ! much cheaper than replacing the entire assembly ! this is the only way to go !</li>
    <li> This product leaked the first time I used it, so I gave it only one star.  I am hoping the seller will replace it.  Otherwise I will have to get a whole new water pic.</li>
    <li> Easy to install.  Works great and a lot cheaper that buying a whole new unit.</li>
    <li> The Handle assembly arrived as scheduled.  It was exactly as ordered.  Since it was a replacement part, it was very easy to install into the Waterpik device.  The new handle works quite well.</li>
    <li> Fixed my Waterpik in 5 minutes!</li>
    <li> correct item quick deliery</li>
    <li> Better than the original part that was in the product. The button to hold the water stream functions much better. Installation is very easy; I bought another as a spare from the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time with instructions and was very easy to install. Would recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> Just like the original, quick easy transaction!</li>
    <li> Easy to install.  Works fine.</li>
    <li> Quality replacement. 2 screw installation. Simple as it gets</li>
    <li> Quick and easy to assemble</li>
    <li> It works like the original did.  I hope it lasts more than 8 months</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT and extremely easy to replace!</li>
    <li> Replacement part that replaced the one we had that developed a split hose.  Works like new niow.</li>
    <li> My Waterpick hose broke and this replacement was easy to install and works well.</li>
    <li> We love our waterpik products, teeth and gums are so much easier to care for.  This was a replacement item for us.  I highly recommend the waterpik flosser!  Well worth the money to keep your teeth healthy!</li>
    <li> I liked the merchandise and the quality.</li>
    <li> thought about replacing hose in older one, but couldn&#x27;t pull it apart.  Only option left was buying a new waterpick until I saw this handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fits perfectly in the WP-100 waterpick.  Just remove the two small philips screws on bottom of unit then pull off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part was delivered 4 days after purchasing.  Buy this one, you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
    <li> Easy to install and does the job!  No need to buy a whole new unit!  Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> great to be able to purchase it without going around to look for it.it is working great.thank you.</li>
    <li> Performed as required.</li>
    <li> Excellent purchase!  Better than butting a new waterpic!</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the transaction.... but do wish waterpik  offered a tubing that was more flexable where it connects to the pic part of the unit... it gets a lot of turning to successfully use the unit.</li>
    <li> made my Waterpik new again</li>
    <li> I ordered this handle to replace one I had broken. When I received the handle it was exactly like the original equipment. I couln&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> Contrary to past reviews, the removal and replacement process was extremely easy.  Admittedly I hesitated to make the purchase earlier because of the negative reviews BUT am glad that I finally made the purchase and now have my Waterpik working again.</li>
    <li> Too bad the waterpik handle breaks so easily but I am thankful that they have these replacement parts. Arrived on time. Should have bought two.</li>
    <li> It was a snap to install and it works perfectly.  Of course, it is a waterpik and I would expect nothing less.</li>
    <li> fixed the problem at a fraction of the price of a new unit, easy to install.</li>
    <li> Good replacement part and easy to install. Saves having to buy a new water pick</li>
    <li> EXACT FACTORY FIT; QUICK INSTALL</li>
    <li> This replacement part is a major improvement over the original handle supplied with my about 3-year-old earlier version of the WaterPik Ultra WP-100. Pushbutton operation is smoother &amp; twist head is also better &amp; easier to use. (Apparently the newer versions of the WaterPik Ultra WP-100 product have this improved handle, so it may not have to be replaced on newer purchases of the WP-100.)</li>
    <li> The original handle fails sooner than later- so it to this on hand, would if I thought it, sooner, though.</li>
    <li> Great price for a fix for my waterpik!</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I needed. Let me repeat myself. It was exactly what I needed.  Let me repeat myself again. It was exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> Previous piping connected to handle cracked.  Easier to purchase new one than to re-splice.  Feeder tube seems to be weak link of this design.  It lasted ~3 years of occasional use.  Hoping new one lasts longer.</li>
    <li> I was amazed that Waterpik would make a replacement part. Easy to replace. Saved me about $40.00 over the cost of a new unit.</li>
    <li> Thank you Universe for Waterpiks. The handles are different for different model numbers, on the bottom of your waterpik you&#x27;ll find the right one AND, this model is much, much easier to fix the handle and hose on than the cheaper model :)</li>
    <li> So happy they have this part!! My hose had cracked and broken at the top. The instructions that came with it for instillation was perfectly easy.</li>
    <li> So far it has been great. It was easy installation and working great so far. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> This kit was very easy to replace on my Waterpik - it only took about 5 minutes, and it works great.  The kit contained a reed valve which had not been installed in my unit when it had been originally assembled.  With this valve now installed the water pressure seems better.  I would recommend this replacement kit to others.</li>
    <li> Took 5 minutes to swap out the broken handle.  So glad to find this.  The last time a hose broke I didn&#x27;t know where to find replacement parts and bought a whole new unit.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for the factory hose that finally broke off. It comes with simple instructions to follow for replacement.</li>
    <li> I could not find a better price in France</li>
    <li> Took less than a minute to install, and works better than my old one. Saved me $45 rather than buying a whole New Waterpik, when the tube on my old one sprung a leak.</li>
    <li> The hose became brittle and broke after 5 years of daily use. The replacement arrived in 2 days and featured clear assembly instructions with pictures. The whole assembly took less than 5 minutes to replace. They also include extra screws and a replacement reed valve. I recommend replacing the reed valve even if yours does not appear damaged. My Waterpik is operating as good as new.</li>
    <li> The water pik handle appears to be the thing that breaks most often.  This replacement is reasonably priced and easy to install.  Be careful opening the package.  There are two small plastic packages enclosed that could easily be lost.  One contains replacement screws while the other contains a small reed valve.  You may not need either, but it is still best to have them.</li>
    <li> Luckily I was able to find this replacement handle at a good price here on Amazon. It arrived quickly, and installs easily. Now my Waterpik, which I use every day, is like new again.</li>
    <li> Replaced original part, which had burst the hose, rendering the unit useless.  Fit perfectly, clear instructions.  I was able to install it in less than five minutes with no trouble.</li>
    <li> Just the one I needed and it even came with new screws and check valve. My old handle the button would stick closed making the waterpick useless until I saw I can replace the part. Highly recommend this to anyone who can use a screw driver.</li>
    <li> Not to much to say but it was a few minutes to unscrew the old broken one and put in this new one. quick and easy to replace. a no brainer!</li>
    <li> Saved the expense of buying a whole new Waterpik.  Easy to install and shipment was quick.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for broken hose.</li>
    <li> This is a great replacement part. Very easy to take out the old, and put in the new. Thank you</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> exactly right for replacement</li>
    <li> My issue with the water piks have always been the wand. I&#x27;ve had 2 where the lock assembly just plain failed.  Replaced the whole unit the first time, this is much more economical.</li>
    <li> When you need it, you need it. This part does need replacement occasionally on the waterpik. But, the waterpik is such a great product, that I can&#x27;t live without it....just wish it was a little better constructed so as to last longer.</li>
    <li> i bought this item&lt;br /&gt;I like this. This is Very good price &amp; Very Good Quality&lt;br /&gt;My wife also like this.</li>
    <li> Easy to install and made the unit as good as new.</li>
    <li> Very easy to install.  It works excellently.</li>
    <li> As advertised. Works great. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Easy replacement.  No problem.</li>
    <li> Extremely easy to replace the old leaking one. Fair price, better than buying a whole new Warerpik. Plan on buying again to keep my old Waterpik operational.</li>
    <li> Easily installed with necessary parts. I can envision this type of hose lasting only so long, still cheaper than an entire new unit.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Easy and quick to replace. Prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> Fit perfect! The thumb switch works much better than the original. Good value for the money. No more words .</li>
    <li> worked great. Saved our very old Waterpik from going to Goodwill. Now it is new again!</li>
    <li> Works great, and very fast delivery</li>
    <li> I recommend this product because its very easy to assemble and a lot cheaper than buying a new Waterpik flosser. I had brought this a couple months ago and I use it everyday, yet there is no problem or breakage. So its pretty durable.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace the handle of my old Hydrofloss.  The price for a replacement handle for it was as much as a new Waterpik, so I decided to try this Waterpik handle instead.  The price was right, and installation was easy.  The best part is that now I can use the Waterpik attachments.</li>
    <li> Recently, the hose of my Waterpik&#x27;s handle developed a crack, and then separated completely from the handle. I was afraid I&#x27;d have to buy a whole new Waterpik, but this replacement assembly kit fixed the problem perfectly. It&#x27;s inexpensive, and I don&#x27;t mind if it has to be replaced every year or so: the clean tubing/internals of the handle are peace-of-mind compared to spending about $10 per year or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the description above (as of 2013-Apr-24) indicates \\&quot;It comes with six tips\\&quot;. Mine did not. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s an issue with the merchant from which I purchased the kit, or if it&#x27;s true for all merchants. It might just be an incorrect description. Offhand, I&#x27;d say... don&#x27;t expect to receive the extra tips. I was hoping to receive them (hence the four stars rather than five).  Even without the advertised extra tips, I&#x27;d still purchase this as needed.</li>
    <li> Easy to install and worked just like new, saved from buying a new waterpic. Very happy with it and would say it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> The old handle was easy to remove, and the new one easy to install.  Just check for water under the base after first use of the new handle - a small puddle means you didn&#x27;t get the new screws tight enough to seal the base-to-handle connection.  New handle works great!.  Old handle was replaced due to crack in hose after several years of use.</li>
    <li> Anyone that owns a waterpik would love this product.  It came complete with the 2 new screws and valve for water pressure.  I advice reading the instructions so you don&#x27;t have to take it apart because you didn&#x27;t replace the valve.  It took me under 5 minutes to put together until I had to redo because I did not read the instructions.  No more wet cloths in the morning or evening from the pin hole in the hose.  Saved me about $50.  Great deal.</li>
    <li> I was able to continue using my Waterpik which had been leaking at the junction of tip and handle. Installation was very easy.</li>
    <li> My husband had tried shortening the tube past the leak but new holes kept appearing.  This saved us from purchasing a new Waterpik.</li>
    <li> This was easy to install and works great.  I&#x27;m glad I purchased this instead of buying a whole new waterpic.</li>
    <li> After 4 or 5 years the tubing became brittle and broke---This apparently is a design flaw and so the manufacture has made the replacement Tube/Handle readily available.  So, for a few bucks I can continue using a machine that should work well for years to come.  I am sooo glad that I did not have to replace the whole machine.</li>
    <li> Easily installed replacement part.  Been using it now for about a year, no problems.</li>
    <li> Dentist tells us to use it every day. I&#x27;ve used one for about 15 or more years.</li>
    <li> It is easy to replace by reading the instruction and it works well. A little pricey for the replacement compared with buying the brand new unit.</li>
    <li> Product seems like an exact replacement for OEM handle. Installs easily with a screwdriver in just a few minutes and performs like a new unit. Hopefully, this replacement will hold up better than the original, but at least the cost and ease of replacement are fair.</li>
    <li> Love my Waterpik and thought it was trash because the handle/spout failed.  Was pleased to find this easily installed replacement.  Now my Waterpik is back in operation :)</li>
    <li> Came timely under the right specs. great !</li>
    <li> This thing worked great and was very simple to put together.  I would sure recommend this to all you good people everywhere.</li>
    <li> We love our Waterpik and have had it for several years. The handle started to leak and we were happy to see it was possible to purchase a replacement part on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The tube to the handle broke and you must order the tube with the handle as one unit.  Easy to replace and much cheaper than ordering a new waterpik.</li>
    <li> fast shipment, good product, clear instruction, and very easy to install, happy with it so far, highly recommeded to anyone.</li>
    <li> good as new, no problems with replacement, all attachments work as they should ,a quality waterpik product as expected !</li>
    <li> I was about to discard my waterpik because the hose had cracked, then I came upon this replacement part. It was very easy to install and the vendor was thoughtful enough to also include a replacement flapper valve, pleasant surprise. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is the replacement handle and hose. It does not come with anything else as incorrectly described in the Amazon description as of today.</li>
    <li> The hose on my old Waterpik developed a leak and I was shopping for a new one when I saw this replacement. It was so easy to replace the old one. It requires a small phillips head screw driver to remove 2 screws, take the old head off and put the new one on. The replacement even included 2 new screws. Easy peasy. I read somewhere that Waterpik heads can get mold on the inside so I cracked open my old one with a hammer and there was no mold at all. Gave me a little peace of mind.</li>
    <li> works just like new again</li>
    <li> This handle assembly kit was easy to install and worked just like the original. The price was reasonable too and I am so glad my Waterpik is working again!</li>
    <li> Thought I&#x27;d have to replace the whole waterpik but this saved me lots of money!! It is very great great</li>
    <li> I had bought one a few month&#x27;s ago from another seller here and needed another for my wife&#x27;s WP-100.&lt;br /&gt;The kit works perfectly but the prior seller got greedy and brought the price up.&lt;br /&gt;This seller had the same ukit at a lower cost. delivered on time as well. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> wonderful that you can get replacement parts with no problem</li>
    <li> Better than my original broken one.&lt;br /&gt;It is easier to lock and unlock the tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they use more durable material in the future model.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;m not pleased with the short life span of the handle, the product has helped with my gums so I&#x27;m willing to replace the handle on occasion. I thought Amazon would have these at a lower cost then the waterpik site but it was not even close. Waterpik sells them for $8.99. I purchased three and paid $5.95 for shipping plus California sales tax. Total was $26.97.</li>
    <li> It came with a new valve I recommend installing it. I have not yet and it seems to take longer for the water to start coming out</li>
    <li> My old assembly cracked and was very brittle.&lt;br /&gt;The replacement was easy to install and quickly solved the problem at reasonable cost.</li>
    <li> Great price. Works Fine. No issues. It fits right away. Easy to install. I will buy it again and again.</li>
    <li> Saved me having to buy a new machine and very easy to change out the part. I would buy it again</li>
    <li> I thought I was going to have to get rid of my water pick when the handle broke off the hose. This was inexpensive, fast and easy.</li>
    <li> it replaced the part good. one of the waterpik attachments didnt connect but the others do. it works good though</li>
    <li> Easy to install, works great.  Looks just like the one (the original) that broke.  I&#x27;m so glad that I didn&#x27;t have to buy a whole new machine!!</li>
    <li> Assembled it in less than 5 minutes and works  perfect. Why buy a new Waterpik when this takes care of the usual broken hoses. I broke open the old handle and found NO mold like some said they did on theirs. Yuk !, did they keep their unit clean ?. Shouldn&#x27;t be a problem just adding the Handle Assembly Kit, my grandmother could do it !!</li>
    <li> Instead of purchasing a new Waterpik, I was able to order this product and save significant money.  It only took a few minutes to replace the worn part.</li>
    <li> Happy with the product and the service!</li>
    <li> My handle assembly broke and I ordered one from you.  It came quickly and was easy to replace and I&#x27;ve been using it without any proble,.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement.  So nice to have the water pic back to new!  Instructions were easy to follow and it was easy to do.</li>
    <li> It took just a few minutes to replace the original and works perfectly  What a savings over buying a completely new Waterpik..&lt;br /&gt;Marv</li>
    <li> Was happy to find this as it was a cheaper alternative to buying new waterpik. Super easy to replace. Water stream is ust as strong as the one I replaced. Good buy!</li>
    <li> Easy to fix, works great!</li>
    <li> Easily replaced old broken handle</li>
    <li> The water line sprung a leak and I was about to throw the whole expensive unit out.  I was on Amazon searching for a replacement waterpick when I saw that this repair kit fit the numbers on my unit.  WP-100.  Yep, looked at the set up into the machine and it was the same as pictured.  For $12  I was able to replace the line and the wand and save myself a bundle on a new unit!  I&#x27;m happy!  It worked perfect!</li>
    <li> The original tubing developed a leak, and I thought I would have to replace the whole appliance,but this inexpensive part was easy to replace. It works works better than the original because the water control button would get stuck and not allow water to flow through.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.  The pricing was excellent, shipping was fast.  I was able to continue to use very expensive waterpik by installing this product rather than buying a new unit.</li>
    <li> I thought I was going to have to get a new waterpik unit until I found the replacement handle - fast shipment, easy to install, fair price</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement when the small hose on our Waterpik severed at the base of the wand. This part arrived in just a few days and fit right in.</li>
    <li> Easy to instal. Product is just like in description.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered in time.</li>
    <li> I am using it now. PERFECT!</li>
    <li> rejuvinated my waterpik.  Easy to replace.</li>
    <li> Easy to install and worked just fine.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses a WaterPik for her braces, and it&#x27;s been great.  The handle unit developed a crack in the hose after about a year and a half of daily use.  I thought I was going to have to buy a new WaterPik but was pleased to find I could just get the handle.  It went in easily and it&#x27;s working great.  Very good way to extend the life of the unit.  The WaterPik has been a fantastic way to clean all the debris out of the braces - I wish we had known about it for our older daughter, but as our younger daughter will be in braces for a very long time, I&#x27;m sure glad we have it for her!</li>
    <li> Probably the easiest repair that I&#x27;ve ever done: All of two screws and less than 5 minutes. This sure beat the price of a new waterpik!</li>
    <li> Thank you for your great service, in spite of the fact that I had forgotten to change my account to our new address. The package came very quickly, after you received the change of address. Everything was in great shape. Thank you, also for the extra mounting screws and butterfly valve. We needed them both.</li>
    <li> Was just what I wanted. Cheap easy works well simple change over .Nice to find parts to replace broken one</li>
    <li> This handle is my first replacement. It is a bit lighter than the original and feels less sturdy by comparison. In addition, it is leaking a bit from the bottom of the handle. It is doing the job however and I&#x27;ll continue to use it until it deteriorates. In any case, returning it would be too costly and too much of a hassle.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s lasted longer than my expectation.  I know that mixing water with mouthwash can corrode this product so I only mix water with about 5% hydrogen peroxide and find it&#x27;s working beyond my expectation and will last a long time without defecting.</li>
    <li> Thank heaven for reasonable replacement parts.</li>
    <li> Great, thought I had to buy a new water pick..fit perfectly</li>
    <li> I was glad to be able to return my water pik to service without it slowly leaking a puddle on the counter.</li>
    <li> My original cord cracked so I bought this replacement and it works perfectly.  It was very simple to install.  I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> I really thought it would be difficult to replace the old one.  It was pretty easy.  It is cheaper than buying a whole new Waterpik.  It works great.</li>
    <li> This replacement handle is east to install and saved me the expense of replacing my waterpik. Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
    <li> The handle was easy to put on, but it drips and the water does not come out with the same power as the original handle. It has prolonged the amount of time for me to use the Waterpik before buying another one.</li>
    <li> Yea, my Waterpik is usable again.&lt;br /&gt;I developed a leak in the hose and this assembly took care of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;It was inexpensive and easy to change.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery of a perfect replacement assembly made it unnecessary to spend $60 for a new WaterPik. How much can I say about an OEM replacement part???</li>
    <li> Easy to install.  Saved me the price of buying a new Waterpik.</li>
    <li> Easy to install.  Works nicely.</li>
    <li> Love my waterpik - since I started to use it, I have not had a single cavity.  This is a great product.  Hoses should be better designed since they break a bit too much - but easy to replace.  Again, love the product.</li>
    <li> I give it this rating because it works just as designed. I ordered it at a good price and it was shipped quickly. It was easy to replace the broken part of this new part.</li>
    <li> This is great to be able to find parts for this product. Its as good as new. Thanks for being there</li>
    <li> The item fit perfectly with my water pik. No troubles and now my water pik work like new . Mike</li>
    <li> I was soaked one night when I turned on my WaterPic. The handle hose had broken. As I was taking it out to the recycle bin I turned it over and noticed that 2 screws hels the handle assemblyto the base.  Ah Ha! Maybe I can get a repleacement. Anazon did the rest. Three days later my &#x27;Pic was back in action.</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement unit for waterpik</li>
    <li> The product is not working for me.  Each time I use it, water leaks around the base of the handle and runs down my face and chin.  This never occurred with the handle assembly kit that originally came with my Waterpik.  Update: I ended up returning the product to the seller.</li>
    <li> A lot cheaper than buying a new one. Arrived just fine and would purchase again if I needed to. Excellent</li>
    <li> saved me lots. Didn&#x27;t have to replace the whole unit! I would recommend any of their products.</li>
    <li> Works fine.  Easy to install.</li>
    <li> Fixed my old Waterpik one, two, three. Cheaper than new machine.</li>
    <li> Exact replacement part. Waterpik is working again with no leaks.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed when mine broke.  They were quick on shipping it so I didn&#x27;t have to be without my Waterpik for very long.</li>
    <li> It is so nice to be able to replace the hose and handle as opposed to replacing the whole unit. I had gone through 3 Water Pik machines over the years with no way to replace a cracked hose. My latest unit had just cracked it&#x27;s hose and what a relief to find this kit on Amazon. My unit has two exposed screws holding the hose onto the bottom. Took the two Phillips screws out, put the new one in. Done in 5 seconds. Anyone can do this with ease.</li>
    <li> Good product!!!! I bought 2 of them.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace the original one that came with the Waterpik.  The original one developed a leak in the hose.  Installation was easy.  Only took about 10 minutes.  Works just like the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with a tiny wafer-thin valve that had to be replaced.  Just make sure that it&#x27;s aligned properly -- one of the sides is flat and must be aligned with the flat side of the hole that it&#x27;s inserted into. Hard to describe in a review, but I&#x27;m sure that you&#x27;ll get the idea as soon as you see it -- and where it has to go.</li>
    <li> It was the exact duplicate of the original one that came with my Waterpik WP - 100. It was easy to replace.</li>
    <li> It accomplished what I needed ....old one was leaking water.  Was easy to do and am very satisfied with the outcome.</li>
    <li> Everything worked out just fine</li>
    <li> Nice to be able to fix my $65 Waterpick for just $17.50 BUT it would be even NICER if Waterpick used a better material for the tube so it would not break after just 18 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to follow instructions. Especially the part about the little thin gasket/valve that looks like a tiny piece of fabric.</li>
    <li> My second one, wish they made them better</li>
    <li> I have had my waterpik flossing unit for over 5 years.  It works great and makes flossing very quick and easy. After so much use, the hose started to leak, so I found this kit.  With just a screwdriver, I was able to replace the old handle assembly in just a few minutes.</li>
    <li> I had gone through a number of water piks over the last twenty years.  The only reason I had to change is because the hose started leaking.  I understand that it is difficult to develop a hose that won&#x27;t leak under high pressure so having the ability to change the hose when it begins to leak at a much lesser cost makes me cheer the Waterpik folks. On top of that, it was so easy to replace.</li>
    <li> Genuine replacement part. No issues at all replacing the old one with this. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll need to do this again so I probably should have just ordered two.</li>
    <li> Excellent product to fix Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;It worked perfect and the part was easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy one more for the future.</li>
    <li> Quick repair of leaking waterpik handle. Saved me from replacing entire waterpik. Waterpik is essential part of oral hygiene and very convinient</li>
    <li> Happy  that I didn&#x27;t have to replace entire unit.  This is a great option and works like a charm!  My Waterpik is like new once again!</li>
    <li> installed quickly and easily. will see how long it lasts before it needs to be replaced again. Must be a design flaw.</li>
    <li> The instruction sheet included with the waterpik made reference to the &amp;#34;reed valve&amp;#34;(replace it with the valve in the kit).  No reed valve was in the kit&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the vendor and was told that no reed valve was included with the kit and it could be purchased separately.  I think&lt;br /&gt;the instruction sheet should be changed to reflect this.</li>
    <li> New handle assemble works fine and was easy to install. I would recommend this replacement hose if yours&lt;br /&gt;leaks like mine.</li>
    <li> Waterpik WP-11 Assenbly Kit was for my husband and, apparently, he found it to be a good product.  I do not know.</li>
    <li> My Waterpik hose broke and I really did not want to trash the unit and buy a new one as it would have been such a waste and expense.  This replacement handle/hose fits and works perfectly and is so easy to install (just two screws under the base).  The price is reasonable, too.</li>
    <li> waterpik has always made excellent products,this replaced old assembly,exactly like old part,works just as well as orignal part,would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> Easy to install, works great and it&#x27;s cheaper than a new unit! It took me about 5 minutes to switch out the handle.</li>
    <li> I bought it just in case, but the original assembly is very, very strong even for daily use. I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I really needed this as the tube on my old handle got cut in half so thank you :) :)</li>
    <li> I almost threw my waterpik away but instead repaired it with this new sprayer.  Now it&#x27;s like new.  GREAT!  Thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband since his water pik died several years ago and he hasn&#x27;t really been able to reliably use it.  This brought new life to his water pik and its so much cheaper than buying a whole new one! It fits tight with no leaks and it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all (it feels the same as the original).  I would highly recommend this if your water pik is in good working order but the hose/pause button are broken.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to see this replacement handle kit.  My cat took a bite out of my handle tubing and it sprayed all over, no way to fix it.  This kit  worked great.  Do, however, read the directions.  I slapped it together quickly and it initally leaked.  If it is aligned properly it will not leak.</li>
    <li> All is well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got what I paid for&lt;br /&gt;Good simple handle repair.&lt;br /&gt;Works like a champ now.... teeth and gums are happy.</li>
    <li> Finding the right part at such a reasonable price (replacing a cracked hose) has returned the appliance to perfect working order for another 5 years!</li>
    <li> The old one cracked and leaked. This solved the problem. Simple to install. (I had to add more words before they would publish this, so here they are.)</li>
    <li> My waterpik handle assembly started leaking and spuing water all over.  I thought I would have to buy another Oral-B unit.  I dreaded the thought of having to spend another $80.00 for a new unit.  A friend told me to Google \\&quot;waterpik WP-100.  I did and up popped all the info I needed.&lt;br /&gt;The assembly works great and one can&#x27;t tell it not the original part of the base unit.  I ordered it through Amazon and the charges didn&#x27;t appear on my bank statement until a day AFTER I received my purchase.  Very impressed with the fast action.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for years now and I never really gave it much though, but the water that goes inside of the button to stop the water as well as the nozzle lets water sit inside of the handle and after time black-mold starts to grow!  Just look at this picture: http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/moX7OCGZOOKXFZ/B000GLRREU/  They do sell a replacement nozzle which I would recommend every 6 months, but also another way to keep the inside of the handle clean is to soak it in a diluted bleach solution or even peroxide.  A good method to do this is in a champagne glass.</li>
    <li> Needed this after the cord on my original started to crack. Works just the same.</li>
    <li> You should always have a spare!  Dang floss could NEVER get that real good Texas Bar-B-Q ribe meat out.  Don&#x27;t be ;left without your water pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, you&#x27;ll need a set of jewelers screwdrivers to complete this job well, or a really small phillips head.</li>
    <li> My husband installed the new Waterpik Handle and it now works as good as new, as well as being more eco-friendly!</li>
    <li> worked good but did not last long.  Have to buy another kit</li>
    <li> The handle of my Waterpik WP-100 broke after 3 years of use. The hose connected to the lower part of the handle started to have a small hole, and water was leaking out at high pressure. Got the replacement handle. Installation is easy.&lt;br /&gt;The handle was like glued on type and so not that easy just to replace the leaking hose (you may break the plastic cover if not careful in prying off the two halves). Besides, Waterpik does not sell the hose only.</li>
    <li> Hose split on the original in a way that could not be repaired. This item was identical to the original and easy to replace. Saved having to buy a complete new Water Pic.</li>
    <li> Replaced my broken pik.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Replacing the handle is easy with the assembly provided.  This lets you repair the Water Pik rather than replace it.</li>
    <li> easy replacement worked like a charm great price</li>
    <li> Saved us approx $50 by installing the handle rather than buying a whole new unit.</li>
    <li> we use the water pik a lot, once the handle valve started clogging up, we replaceed it with this, works like new again.....cheaper than buying a whole new machine.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do. It is unfortunate that Waterpik produces a product that requires you to replace the whole handle when the hose breaks. Also too bad it costs so much for this piece of plastic but certainly cheaper than buying a new Waterpik.</li>
    <li> Installed without any problem at all and works just like new. :o)</li>
    <li> It does not seem to be of the same quality as the original handle. Water leaks on the side of the handle. In the past the hose has been broken after a couple of years use, but this one seems to be of a poorer quality.</li>
    <li> If stars are not enough; please stop asking for my review. I could just as easily not do any of it and just delete your emails.</li>
    <li> It was as advertised and was easy to install.  I am very happy with it and didn&#x27;t need to throw away my water pic</li>
    <li> The Waterpik WP-100 Handle Assembly Kit was just what I needed to make my Waterpik work again. So easy to install. Thank you Amazon again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just happy that the part is available and I don&#x27;t have to by a whole new one.</li>
    <li> easy to replace - saved a bunch of $$$ vs. purchasing a new unit. Works like a charm - recommend</li>
    <li> Very easy to install and my Waterpik is now like new.  Save money by not buying a brand new unit.</li>
    <li> Easy to replace. Works like brand new</li>
    <li> I was satisfied with a previous purchase of this same item.  This purchase was again a satisfactory deal.  The item works well.  I have recommended this item to someone.  I would recommend it to anyone needing these parts.</li>
    <li> Waterpik&#x27;s are plastic, and bound to eventually fall apart.  I was pretty upset when when the hose from the pump/well to the handle cracked.  Fortunately, I didn&#x27;t have to buy a whole new Waterpik (not a cheap proposition,) and I could spend twenty bucks for any easily installed handle.  I thank you, my dentist does not.</li>
    <li> Received merchandise quickly.  Very easy change over.  Would highly recommend to my friends &amp; associates.</li>
    <li> A REPLACEMENT FOR THE ORIGANAL THAT DEVELPOED A SPLIT IN THE LINE!!!!  CAUSING A WATER LEACKAGE AT THE SPLIT!!! THANKS FOR ASKING</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement.  Wish it was a little chraper.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and clear instructions to install the parts. In a minute, the working unit starts running again.&lt;br /&gt;I felt good that I was not making another working tool into the trash can.</li>
    <li> What a great way to extend the life of a good product.  I just happened to find the replacement part when I was researching Water Piks.</li>
    <li> perfect part for repair.  Took about two minutes.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> i thought i would have to buy a new water pic, and found this so i could repair mine a lot cheaper</li>
    <li> This hand assembly kit was very easy to install. (even right down to the reed or bamboo washer....whatever they called it...) in the opening.  I now have a back up Waterpik.  I would definitely purchase this again for another Waterpik.</li>
    <li> Saved me from having to buy a new waterpik love the product-what a find. It&#x27;s nice to know you don&#x27;t have to throw an item away just because one part breaks!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and restored the WaterPik I have used for years.  I recommend getting some silicone grease to lubricate the rubber seals (particularly the one between the body and the tank) so they fit smoothly and don&#x27;t leak.</li>
    <li> I just hope it lasts longer than the original one!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.  Works better than any others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Works great, fast shipping, thanks</li>
    <li> This product is easily installed (screw driver) and a perfect fit. Delivery was prompt and&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m completely satisfied with the Handle assembly.</li>
    <li> The installation went without a hitch, but, the first time I used the handle, it leaked from the ejection button and at the base where the hose enters the handle.  If Waterpik really manufactured this item, their quality control methods have deteriorated.</li>
    <li> I have had my Waterpik for about five years. The only part that went bad was the hose. Being able to replace it is great.</li>
    <li> This can be bought directly from Waterpik for $8.99.  Nothing wrong with the item itself.  Just don&#x27;t need to pay this much for it.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Easy to install and much cheaper than buying a new complete waterpik. Works exactly like the part it replaced.</li>
    <li> We actually have liked this product and used it for more than two years.  However, recently when changing the tip I noticed black particles coming out of the hand-held wand bulb.  I then hit this plastic section against the sink and dislodged a considerable amount of additional black material.  I felt it was then important to break open this plastic bulb section - the part you hold in your hand - and found it full of black colored mold!  In my opinion this is a serious design flaw.  Since this section is not sealed, it should be possible to clean it.  Yet, in the Waterpik manual, you will find no instructions on how to do this, or that it is even necessary. I have read one third-party article that recommends periodic soaking of this plastic bulb in vinegar.  However, there is no a way to assure that it is clean, without breaking it.  It does appear that any mold in the plastic case of the hand unit may not contaminate the water spray into the mouth, however, the proximity of mold growth so close to mouth is, in my opinion, unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Waterpik to advise them of my concern, noting that, while we don&#x27;t seem to be allergic to mold, many people are and this section of their device should 1) be re-manufactured to allow opening and cleaning and 2) cleaning procedures should be published in their manual. Obviously, we have discontinued using the Water Pik. To their credit, the company has responded by email and is, apparently, now looking into this matter.  They have offered a replacement unit and we have declined.</li>
    <li> Love this!  It saved me from buying my granddaughter a new Waterpik when she accidentally laid her curling iron near the old one.  Ooops!</li>
    <li> My Wp-100 started leaking from a split in the tubing right at the handle.  I had almost decided to purchase a new one (only about 18 months to 24 months old) when I happened across this handle kit.  It is very easy to install (about 5 minutes max) and restored operation of the unit.  I am very satisfied!</li>
    <li> So happy I could buy this here, and quickly fix my waterpik water flosser. Very easy to replace.</li>
    <li> Easy to replace. I think it took me about 5 minutes. Most of it deciding if there was a  right and wrong way to replace to diaphragm. I finally couldn&#x27;t decide and just picked one,  Works like new again.</li>
    <li> easy to install and works great.</li>
    <li> The hose on my Waterpik broke apart at the bottom of the unit. The handle assembly kit was easy to replace and is much cheaper than buying a new machine. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Easy to install and saved us the cost of a new machine - yeah for Amazon!</li>
    <li> Our original hose got too close to the curling iron and melted so we ordered a replacement kit.  Unfortunately the \\&quot;new\\&quot; and \\&quot;improved\\&quot; wand has a push button to turn the spray \\&quot;off\\&quot; whereas the original one had a sliding switch.  Let me warn you, if your thumb slips off the button for just a second, it will make a mess of your bathroom and hurts like Hell when it hits your eye.  The new wand should be recalled and replaced with the old tried and proved model.</li>
    <li> This is a great product/part.  It saved my waterpick from the trash.  Much more economical than buying an entire new waterpick.  Installation was easy and all you need is a philips screwdriver.  It even arrived via first class mail.</li>
    <li> saved us from buying a whole new instrument!</li>
    <li> came in good condition, along with instructions which I didn&#x27;t need.</li>
    <li> Everything worked out great!!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks</li>
    <li> So much better than having to purchase a whole new unit.</li>
    <li> the original handle that came with the unit started to leak,  bought this new handle, which seems to be revised, problem fixed and good as new.</li>
    <li> When your waterpik handle falls apart, this is the part to get.  Of course, a handle less prone to falling apart would be nice.</li>
    <li> saved  $80 by just replacing  the part that was brken</li>
    <li> A very nice and simple replacement kit for the Waterpik. The pause button on this kit works better than the original!</li>
    <li> Had to replace an old unit that would get stuck. This was an identical part and worked flawlessly - save me the cost of buying a new reservoir/system!</li>
    <li> Worked as advertised and was an easy fix to avoid the expense of buying a brand new Waterpik unit.</li>
    <li> Be sure to check your water pik model number before ordering. I did not and cannot use the handle assembly.</li>
    <li> noce to be able to buy a replacement part instead of having to buy a new unit.  shipped quickly and was easy to install.  cost was bettter than e-bay and Amazpn is so good with customer relations I knoedw that if I had a problem they would fix it.</li>
    <li> This item restored my broken, useless Waterpik to original condition.  The replacement was fairly easy and quick to perform, taking only 5 minutes.  And, the price was very reasonable, considering the cost of a brand new Waterpik machine.</li>
    <li> Cavities have not occurred and gums have improved. Bad breath have is rare. I use the Waterpik every night before goinf to bed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little mad that I had to replace this so soon on my Waterpik model. The part itself seems fine so far, but I wish the price were a bit better.</li>
    <li> I thought I was going to have to buy a new unit after the hose cracked at the handle but what the heck, check amazon and see.  This is a perfect fit and took less than 5 minutes to replace.</li>
    <li> Great Experience.Prompt and correct delivery.</li>
    <li> It worked perfect.  I was unaware that one could buy parts like that.  Saved me a few dollars..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C. M. Saunders</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. This is a replacement part and just as described. Fit our electric tooth brush motor.</li>
    <li> Well made went on as advertised.</li>
    <li> The handle assembly works great.  A simple replacement job that only takes a few minutes.  I hope this one lasts longer than the one that came with the original unit.</li>
    <li> The piece saved me money in that I could still use the base and not purchase the entire unit. Thanks</li>
    <li> Works perfect, easy to put on.</li>
    <li> It was really easy to break the old unit down and to reattach the replacement handle to the unit. Would recommend for sure.</li>
    <li> I guess it was okay, I don&#x27;t remember the order.</li>
    <li> My original handle valve started sticking closed after about 3 months of normal use. This could have been avoided if the handle/valve came with serviceable parts. I broke apart my original, pulled the valve apart, greased with silicone grease and wrapped it back up with a hose clamp. The repaired one will be my backup when this new one fails in a few months. Ghetto? Yea I know but I think it&#x27;s ridiculous to have to replace the whole handle every few months because the valve sticks.</li>
    <li> For my husband.  He loves it as his old one died after he used it for 10 years.</li>
    <li> Arrived well withing promised time. A very easy fix, and my Waterpik is back in action again.</li>
    <li> Product okay, but was able to be used. Could not adapt to existing unit.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find this because I thought I might have to replace my WaterPik. I found this which is exactly what I needed and put it on and it works great enabling me to get more years out of my WaterPik.</li>
    <li> Really quick delivery.  Installed in less than a minute.  Thankful for the inclusion of a flapper valve!</li>
    <li> The hose in my handle split, so I ordered this to replace it. It was easy to install, and works very well.</li>
    <li> Perfect!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using It!!!</li>
    <li> The hose connection broke apart so I ordered this repair part. Assembly was very easy and now the product now works fine.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  My Waterpik is like new with this new handle.  Have had mine for many years and used it several times a day.  It comes with a replacement reed, and that is what has really made the difference.  The original reed was pretty soggy, so the it seems the Pik had lost power as a result.  Working great now!</li>
    <li> The Waterpic Handle Assembly comes with instructions and is very simple to replace. No complaints about the Handle Assembly Kit.  ...But this is the third time I have had to replace it.  The hose is brittle and in a year or so snaps off where it enters the handle.  The handle does not disassemble for repairs, you have to buy this assembly kit and replace it. After the last replacement, I wrapped some white duct tape as extra support to prevent any flexing of the hose where it enters the handle.  You might save some $$$ by ordering two when you make the first replacement, so you will already have a spare on hand.</li>
    <li> this saved me the price of a new water pick,it works like a new one now,glad i ordered a extra one for the next time ,this was easy to put on ,vary happy with it</li>
    <li> Perfict fit, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Works just fine, wish I had bought it sooner.</li>
    <li> works well and easy to put on.  so thankful for this vs having to buy a whole new unit</li>
    <li> great - just fixed the old machine!</li>
    <li> Water pik was leaking so I bought this and swapped it out with the one that was on the machine and it wasn&#x27;t hard to do at all.  My water Pik is working fine and not leaking.</li>
    <li> everything it said &amp; on time</li>
    <li> cheap replacement rather than buying a new unit.</li>
    <li> There is not more about this other than it is a original replacement so you kind of expect it to be the same as the original.</li>
    <li> The fit and finish worked fine I liked it</li>
    <li> My original plastic water tube broke rendering the waterpik useless.  Bought this and the plastic hard tube broke at the base.  But, luckily had a spare.  Plugged it into the soft pipe and has been working for months without a leak.  I use it every day.  I&#x27;ll be back to buy another--sometime when the flexible plastic tube breaks.</li>
    <li> Love this so much!!! When my newest on breaks ill ve buying this again.  Your teeth come clean and gums feel amazing aftet just one use.  It also was a very easy task to replace the part.</li>
    <li> So happy your received this so quickly. old handle/wand had the &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; button jammed. actual website for waterpik had long back order on product. worth the bit extra $</li>
    <li> It works. That&#x27;s what I expected! Thank you.</li>
    <li> I wish the original equipment hose material and this replacement hose material was more flexible, sturdy, and likely to give long service.</li>
    <li> This was the exact replacement for my Waterpik.  It saved me from buying a whole new unit.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement part.</li>
    <li> I clean my teeth with Waterpik WP-100 every night before bed.  My dentist tells me that my teeth are in excellent shape each time I have my teeth cleaned.  I have a small one for my trips too.  I thought I had to buy a new Waterpik when the handle broke.  I&#x27;m glad I could replace it so fast, easy, and for much less money!!</li>
    <li> This handle is the exact replacement for the one that I had. The button that stops the water flow was starting to stick in and not allow the resumption of the water so I purchased three replacement heads so I could change it out every year. The product is very good but the seller does not provide any sort of information for tracking or the status of the shipment. It just arrived in the mail about a week after ordering them. Some sort of tracking mechanism would be desirable so customers would know the status of the order.</li>
    <li> Beats buying a new Waterpik but if handle was made to take apart you could replace O-rings cheaply. Simple to install.</li>
    <li> Fit good and works as advertised.  Saved me from buying a new waterpik.  Would buy again if the need arises.</li>
