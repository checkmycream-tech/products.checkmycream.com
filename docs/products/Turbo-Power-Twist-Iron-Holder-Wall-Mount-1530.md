    <li> Great product. Love that my curling iron is not jammed in a drawer.</li>
    <li> Perfect in my bathroom!</li>
    <li> Hated burning myself on the stupid curling iron always left out.  This was sturdy, as everyone else mentioned, but also looked really good.  We had brushed nickel, but this didn&#x27;t seem too terribly out of place.  If you have chrome fixtures it would be a slam dunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holds the hot curling iron with no problems.  It stays secure, and doesn&#x27;t have the slightest inclination of falling out, which was my concern.  The back doesn&#x27;t get too hot either.  I was worried it would scorch the drywall or something; which has definitely not happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got one screw into the stud, the other is just kinda holding it in place.  Would be nice to have a third screw hole towards the top for stability, to get two screws into a stud.  It&#x27;s not holding a ton of weight though, so this works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you enjoy having little hooks and places for everything, or just want the wife&#x27;s curling iron off the sink, this is the only decent solution I&#x27;ve seen anywhere (home stores, hardware stores, big box stores...) and well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This product is VERY high quality.  That said, I wish that the listing had included the dimensions. My Hot Tools curling iron is quite long and way too much of it would have stuck out the top since this Holder has a solid bottom---too precarious. I had to send it back. I must say that the product arrived very quickly and I received my refund quickly as well.</li>
    <li> just what i wanted to keep the clutter of the sink but would have liked it to be a bit smaller</li>
    <li> I like this chrome spring unit because it is Quality made. Heavy chrome to last. Heavy steel twisty spring look that is Tough as nails. For my use I ground off the bottom plate of the spring.&lt;br /&gt;Unit mounts nicely with provided screws and drywall plugs. I liked it so much I ordered the twisty spring wall mount for the curling iron. They match and look great on the side of the bathroom sink.</li>
    <li> I mounted this on the wall- it was easy. It holds my curling iron perfectly because of the bottom plate. It also would hold my blow dryer if I wanted to switch. I have another bottomless one for my dryer, but this is better because it&#x27;s interchangeable.</li>
    <li> Looks like a nice chrome finish as advertised but what I received is more like a smokey yellow tarnished chrome.  When compared to their other $20+ dryer holder, it&#x27;s a different color.  I give it two stars for its sturdiness.  Photo is side by side with other product with true chrome color.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron holder to get cords off my vanity.  It&#x27;s sturdy, easy to install and very handy.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to get my wife&#x27;s hair curler OFF THE SINK. Ahhhhhhh....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s a reclaimed motorcycle spring, but I don&#x27;t care. Could have a nicer weld.</li>
    <li> works great for curling iron.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how I lived without it before.  Very convenient strong, sturdy, does its job while being stylish at the same time</li>
    <li> Great holder for my flat iron. It is metal so won&#x27;t melt. It is pretty heavy so I put one screw into a stud for stability. Looks nice and works great. Just what I needed.</li>
    <li> I kept this in the box for a while before my bathroom was ready for it to be installed. Within two months the bottom plate is rusting a lot and rust is starting on the curly part. Disappointed. Other than that, it seems very sturdy and heavy.</li>
    <li> Too shallow for angled mounting. You would need to mount it upright to keep regular sized curling iron in place.  Heavy, too.</li>
    <li> I chose this for my hair curter, but using it for my hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Would need a deeper and narrow unit for the curler.</li>
    <li> Perfect for letting my flat iron cool and keeping it hid out of sight beside medicine cabinet.  Much nicer looking than some of the other solid black caddies I was looking at before finding this one.  I did have a problem screwing it into the wall - the screw/molly didn&#x27;t agree with my drywall and it almost seemed like it wanted to strip going in - easy enough to fix though.</li>
    <li> My 1 1/2 inch flat iron fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> Perfect for flat irons and curling irons! Use it all the time.</li>
    <li> I wanted something nice, pretty, and well made to hold my chi iron. This holder works great. It is a nice size to hold to iron. The item itself is a little larger than I thought it would be. However, it is very well made and nice &amp;#34;twist&amp;#34; to a boring holder. I&#x27;ll plan to get another one for my sister.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what the manufacturers were thinking, but this thing is way too heavy duty. This thing could support 15+ pounds!  They could have made it much more aesthetically pleasing, if they weren&#x27;t trying to make it so industrial and heavy duty. That being said, it is very handy for holding my curling iron out of the way. Try to screw into a stud - it&#x27;s ridiculous heavy for this type of product.</li>
