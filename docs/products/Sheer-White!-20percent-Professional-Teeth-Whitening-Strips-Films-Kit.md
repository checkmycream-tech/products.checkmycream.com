      <li>After I use the whitening strips, I&#x27;ll write my own review.  </li>
      <li>I liked the product.</li>
      <li>Bought these through my dentist and really liked how they worked.</li>
      <li>I wear them overnight for 5 nights; the strips stay in place and effectively whiten my teeth after just 5 applications.</li>
      <li>The product is good, however, the box had been tampered with and came incomplete with 4 sets of strips rather than the original 5 that should be in the package.</li>
      <li>Works great, noticeable difference after the first use.</li>
      <li>Also, the Crest strips don&#x27;t taste good (though they&#x27;re tolerable) whereas these have an added sweet minty flavor.</li>
      <li>(it is very important to floss</li>
      <li>The strips are huge!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought these.</li>
      <li>So much better than the store bought version.</li>
      <li>I love these, but not to thrill about the sensitivity.</li>
      <li>In my opinion, it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
      <li>Love the strips...</li>
      <li>I will purchase more.  </li>
      <li>Thank you all again.&lt;br /&gt;Dottie from Pennsylvania :)</li>
      <li>and I have tried many, even a $250.00 kit from my dentist.</li>
      <li>However, is truly  so much better than Crest Diamond Whitening Strips.</li>
      <li>I am satisfied with the quality of this product.  </li>
      <li>The taste was OK to me</li>
      <li>My boys use these before going out and love them.  </li>
      <li>To be able to keep the whitened teeth I have now, it is recommended to use one strip every 3-4 months.  </li>
      <li>My suggestion for those reviewers that did not have good results--make sure you get your teeth cleaned by your dentist first, then try these strips.  </li>
      <li>It is well worth the money!!  </li>
      <li>they are also very easy to use and you dont need to use them for the full 8 hrs.</li>
      <li>Easy to use</li>
      <li>It is easy for me to use, and does whiten my teeth noticeably in a couple of days.</li>
      <li>Kit must be refrigerated and is fairly easy to apply (I needed to watch a you tube video before).  </li>
      <li>Really easy to use.</li>
      <li>Easy to remove.</li>
      <li>Absolute best that I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Super easy to use.</li>
      <li>They stay in place and have a very mild minty taste.</li>
      <li>these things work great do make your teeth a litte sensitive but worth it!</li>
      <li>I purchased from him (at a much higher price) and was happy to find this product at a much lower price on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>I really have enjoyed the quality of this product!  </li>
      <li>The taste was not the most pleasant, and the drool factor was pretty high.</li>
      <li>Crest white strips works great for retainers.</li>
      <li>It took a few minutes to get each strip on, but once I molded them perfectly to my teeth, it looked as if I had nothing on my teeth at all.  </li>
      <li>So, it works great, but the results do not last.  </li>
      <li>is you do have to leave these in for a couple of hours, but they fit</li>
      <li>I am still pretty happy with the whitening results and I use only once a week, more on a maintenance schedule.</li>
      <li>pretty good and fast results.</li>
      <li>I have used Crest Whitestips in past and they are excellent.  </li>
      <li>They do work well - I saw results after the first time and I have 4 more to go.</li>
      <li>There are a lot of whitening strips out there and most of them get your teeth nice and white.</li>
      <li>But at the end we many times make a conscious decision to suffer for the look :-)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure with the full box, I will be thrilled with the final results.</li>
      <li>Overall, good product.</li>
      <li>(good if you have big teeth</li>
      <li>The taste is not bad kinda like toothpaste.</li>
      <li>The strips do not appear to have as much product as they used to stay put and adhere to the teeth with a strong grip, this set was not as strong of a hold and came away much too easily.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Used once then in the trash.</li>
    <li> Purchased from dentist and loved the product and was excited to find it on amazon for half the price.  It was delivered quickly, the only problem was the product was all dried out and a total waste of money.  The expiration date on the package said it didn&#x27;t expire until November.  I would not order from this company again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this until my niece who is a regular Amazon buyer showed me her package. Although the strips were easier for me to apply and didn&#x27;t slide the whitening  effect was mediocre. My niece also showed me one of the packets from her box and it had a very bubbly surface all over one strip besides the ribbon of peroxide. The other strip was growing some very lumpy white material on the inside and the outside of the strip. I wish the country of origin was a mandatory  part of of the advertisement.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I purchased this same kit from my dentist at TWICE the price.  Kit must be refrigerated and is fairly easy to apply (I needed to watch a you tube video before).  This is actually the third kit purchased for my family.  And yes, my teeth were noticably whiter.</li>
    <li> Takes a while for these strips to give the results desired. However, is truly  so much better than Crest Diamond Whitening Strips.</li>
    <li> It actually works! This was recommended by my dental hygenist and it gets all the coffee-induced yellowing off my teeth. I buy it again and again.</li>
    <li> I love these, but not to thrill about the sensitivity. I recommend not to leave on pass the requirements. Other than that, they work. A little slow results but they do work....</li>
    <li> I tried the sheer White Strips and found them to be dried out thus not effective. I was unable to apply any of them as they crumbled before applying them. I do no feel they are the same quality I received my dentist. Upon calling the company I was told that the only true Sheer Strips have to come from the dentist not any where else. Subsequently, I feel this product I received from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;com was not the same as I had received from my dentist..</li>
    <li> The Sheer White whitening strips are excellent. Once you place the strips on your teeth you don&#x27;t even notice them. They stay in place and have a very mild minty taste. I wore them to sleep at night and had no problems whatsoever.  Really good product with a good value for the results.</li>
    <li> They use to work very well, not sure if they are using something different. not as happy with the results</li>
    <li> I wish I could rate them at 0 stars! I bought these from my dentist.  I had 5 sets, however, I only used them for my top teeth, which meant I ended up with 10 strips.  I did 10 overnight treatments on my top teeth only, and my teeth did NOT lighten AT ALL.  My top and bottom teeth are the EXACT same color, despite having done 10 overnight treatments on my top teeth (yeah, about 80 hours worth of whitening).  The strips are all the same size, and are rectangular shaped, which is a pain.  Crest strips have smaller strips for the bottom, and they have grooves to avoid over-folding when you apply them.  The Sheer Whites did not have that.  And the taste of the Sheer White is disgusting. It completely leaks out of the strips, it is NOT  slight taste, it&#x27;s an overpowering taste, and it continues the entire time you have the strips on.  Anyway, they don&#x27;t work AT ALL.  Crest 2 Hour work pretty decent, I&#x27;d recommend those.</li>
    <li> these things work great do make your teeth a litte sensitive but worth it! I would deff use these again. they are also very easy to use and you dont need to use them for the full 8 hrs.</li>
    <li> I like the results, but because the strips are not scalloped or in gel form, my gingival tissue get sore/tender and sensitive teeth for several days after.  I avoid cold drinks and foods; don&#x27;t drink coffee or tea,  Using Sensodyne toothpaste between applications is very helpful.  Have received numerous compliments  from close friends and relatives.</li>
    <li> This product did work well. However, to get the best results I found that leaving the product on over night as some customers have suggested, does a better job at whitening teeth. This product isn&#x27;t as strong as other products I&#x27;ve previously used but it is less expensive. The only cons that I have with the product, is that it takes some working with to apply film and remove it from your teeth. Otherwise, I would repurchase this product.</li>
    <li> Good product. I started using them in my dentist office. They don&#x27;t do miracles, but provide good results.</li>
    <li> These have to been the best whitening strips I have ever used. The taste is not bad kinda like toothpaste. I can&#x27;t sleep with them in because of how much they cause me to salivate. They stick well to your teeth if yours are straight like mine. Any bad reviews are probably because they had a outdated box of strips. Or did not store them in the fridge</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 2 nights and I must say that each morning I&#x27;ve woken up, my teeth feel extremely sensitive.  I gave Sheer White 3 stars because it actually does noticeably whiten your teeth but the the pain is unbearable at this point.  I will not be keeping these in overnight but rather 2 hours during the day time.</li>
    <li> great product with great results in just 5 days</li>
    <li> The strips are too thick and uncomfortable.  Did not notice change in brightness of teeth.  I have used Crest Whitestips in past and they are excellent.  Thinner strips and great results.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and it works. Great price too. As I am a dental hygienist -I will tell all my patients to buy them</li>
    <li> In my opinion, it&#x27;s just okay. It DOES NOT work under clear retainers (top&amp;bottom) after having braces. Crest white strips works great for retainers. These strips are way thicker and very sticky. The DO NOT remove tough a stains after years of wearing braces and they have a strange minty taste, not really great for hours of wear.... it needs to taste better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF you were a braces wearer like I was and now on those clear retainers, get a professional clearing (NOT whitening) to remove those though stains AND then wear something like Crest strips AND then wear the retainers over them.</li>
    <li> Saw a noticeable difference after using one strip overnight. Works better than the other strips I have used in the past. It does cause teeth sensitivity for a few hours if you sleep with them on overnight, but what whitening strips don&#x27;t cause teeth sensitivity.</li>
    <li> The strips seem to work fairly well.  I have one comment.  There are five sealed packets in the box.  The first two I opened contained the desired strips.  The third one contained no strips.  Even though it was just as carefully sealed as the first two.  Ripoff?</li>
    <li> Just got my Sheer whitening strips. I&#x27;ve bought them before so I know they really work. The only complaint is that I wish they would not be as costly as they are. Also they&#x27;re only 5 strips on the box for 5 days. If you feel like your gums hurt after a day, take a day off and continue with the treatment.</li>
    <li> I liked the product. Strips stick to teeth well and you can really see the difference in the whitening. Only drawback was that some of the strips were stickier than others in the pack and I&#x27;m not sure if some were not kept in the refrigerator</li>
    <li> So, it works great, but the results do not last.  I used it and my teeth were very white, but the results only lasted for 7 days.  I would hope that they make a product that actually lasts and isn&#x27;t so temporary.</li>
    <li> These strips are easy to use and whiten teeth faster than the best Crest brand strips.  I wear them overnight for 5 nights; the strips stay in place and effectively whiten my teeth after just 5 applications.</li>
    <li> always receive compliments on how white my teeth are...this is what I use a couple of times a year.  My dentist sells the same product at over twice the price!</li>
    <li> Bought these through my dentist and really liked how they worked. Thought I&#x27;d save a few dollars and buy them on Amazon but they came in dried and the whitener was actually put on the wrong side of some of the strips. I noticed on this pkg that they were made in China. Maybe they weren&#x27;t kept at the proper temperature in storage. The date on them is for Nov.2017, so they weren&#x27;t out of date. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying these online.</li>
    <li> Love the results - buying it 2nd time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what happened. I have bought these before and loved them. They really whitened quickly almost as well as professional whitening. This time they were splotchy when I opened them. LIke they were old or melted or something so they don&#x27;t coat as evenly as they should. I do like the brand of strips so it could be who I ordered these from, not sure.</li>
    <li> I have used Crest white strips in past with some definite whitening.  These strips are very big, so hard to handle and wrap  (good if you have big teeth I guess) and also don&#x27;t have much oomph in the way of whitening. They did not fizz or seem like they were doing much of anything. I would recommend paying the extra and springing for the brand name Crest whitestrips- and even with those it takes about 2 boxes to make a noticible difference.</li>
    <li> I have been using for almost 3 days now and so far so good, my teeth is really sensitive lately but i can see the difference already.</li>
    <li> This product works pretty good, but it takes a few days for the effects to completely show. The taste isn&#x27;t too bad either. Just make sure and apply this product a few days before your big event (if you have one). It does work, but it takes some time.</li>
    <li> Great deal! It whitens, it brightens, and it costs less than what they charge at the dentist office.</li>
    <li> It tastes good - not that you want to ingest any of these products...&lt;br /&gt;The strips really adhere/mould well to one&#x27;s teeth. Whitening strength is just as good as any other product I have tried.</li>
    <li> Works well. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> These really work! My husband had some very expensive whitening done in the dentist&#x27;s office years ago. His teeth whitened a bit but they were still somewhat stained and yellow. My daughter became a hygienist and got these for him. All I can say is WOW! His teeth are white... years of stain came off... and he looks so much younger. You don&#x27;t necessarily realize that white teeth are associated with youth and health; stained teeth make you look old. He can wear these for hours and has no sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping but not up to code! These strips are supposed to be kept refrigerated! They were not, so I wasted my money on 2 that I could not even use</li>
    <li> I had purchased these from one seller on here before and loved the product but when purchased again from a different seller it was an awful experience. The taste as best as I could describe it was one of cat urine and I will not be purchasing again and threw out the remaining strips that where left. I would recommend buying whitening strips from a store to avoid in circumstances that I had to endure.</li>
    <li> I saw no difference while using this product from the time I began until I finished the pack. The one slightly visible difference was white spots on my teeth.</li>
    <li> I wore mine all night long. The taste was not the most pleasant, and the drool factor was pretty high. It did lighten a bit. About as good as Crest&#x27;s Two Hour Strips.   Make sure that you floss and brush before you put these strips on, and that you use the little tool to push the strips down between your teeth. If you don&#x27;t you will look like you have a darker line around your gum line.</li>
    <li> Love the strips... I wear them while I sleep and wake up with amazing results!  This is the 2nd time I have purchased them and will do so again.</li>
    <li> These do work and do seem to affect my tooth sensitivity a little bit less than Crest White Strips. I got them from my dentist - beware I paid about $200 for two boxes of these! - and was advised not to wear them overnight, which I would not do with any whitening strip anyway, but to wear only for an hour up to a few hours. I will let them know that they are grossly overcharging. (Could they be paying exorbitantly due to buying from a medical supplier??) I give these four stars because I just now am seeing that they are made in China. I haven&#x27;t yet researched Henry Schein, and I haven&#x27;t yet looked at the MSD sheet. Maybe I&#x27;ll change my rating later. They work about the same as the Crest strips but if tooth sensitivity is an issue for you, you might want to try these. Also, the Crest strips don&#x27;t taste good (though they&#x27;re tolerable) whereas these have an added sweet minty flavor.</li>
    <li> I have tried several teeth whitening kits, including ones that can only be dispensed to dentists due to the high percentage of peroxide.  Sheer White is the best, and I like the fact that you can wear them at night.  My suggestion for those reviewers that did not have good results--make sure you get your teeth cleaned by your dentist first, then try these strips.  I also want to tell you that my teeth are not naturally yellow but whitish anyway-however, I love wine and coffee, and these 2 beverages do tend to stain your teeth between regular cleanings from the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to purchase..love this product!!</li>
    <li> Got these from my dentist for $40. At first they really seemed to work well, a few shades lighter, then the rest of the strips I never saw a change. They irritate my gums and make my teeth really sensitive. The strips are pretty big, I cut them nearly in half so they don&#x27;t touch my gums (which is kind of a good thing if you think about it, I get two strips out of one lol.) Now mind you I have a sensitive mouth, so it probably won&#x27;t be so bad for everyone. These are the first whitening strips I&#x27;ve ever used. For the price, I would say give it a shot.</li>
    <li> I really have enjoyed the quality of this product!  The results were very noticeable once i completed the kit.  This is the same Sheer Whitening system used by my dentist office at a significantly higher price.  You wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Sheer White worked very well, but I only purchased a 1 week supply. I think if I would have continued for the second week I really would have got to the desired whiteness I was looking for. But even just using it for 5 days my teeth were so much whiter and have a glossiness to them. Easy to use, a little gum sensitivity but not bad .&lt;br /&gt;Buy at least 2 sets of 5 for next time!</li>
    <li> It does take 4 or 5 times to get good results</li>
    <li> These teeth whitening strips really work and have not irritated my gums.  They&#x27;re really easy to use and stronger than the usual whitening strips you buy over the counter.  And a lot cheaper than buying them at the dentist.</li>
    <li> If you want white teeth and don&#x27;t wish to pay what the dentist will charge for the same product buy now!</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended these, rather than paying $300 to have them professionally whitened by him.  To avoid sensitivity, he suggested using Sensodyne toothpaste for two  weeks before I whitened.  I had no problems AT ALL with my teeth being sensitive to the bleach.  The strips were sticky enough that they did not come off.  The tool they used worked perfectly for pushing the strips in-between  my teeth.  It took a few minutes to get each strip on, but once I molded them perfectly to my teeth, it looked as if I had nothing on my teeth at all.  You need to wear the strips all night  and use up the entire box (5 nights worth) to really get the full effect.  I do go to get my teeth cleaned from the dentist twice a year, so if you have very stained teeth from not having them cleaned in years, I don&#x27;t know how white they will be.  To be able to keep the whitened teeth I have now, it is recommended to use one strip every 3-4 months.  It is well worth the money!!  I tried the Crest strips before and it hardly gave me the same results as these.</li>
    <li> Did not irritate my teeth or gums and i have super sensitive teeth. Noticeable difference after two nights.  Will purchase again</li>
    <li> Whitening process is effective for us.  They aren&#x27;t as thin as other brands I&#x27;ve used.  Some we have used break apart when I try to remove them and these stay fairly well intact so I don&#x27;t have pieces on my teeth that I need to pick off.  The hydrogen peroxide is stronger than any others I have seen and used.  Our family has order 4 of these.  We&#x27;ll use these again.  Best price we have found.</li>
    <li> I bought a box of these same strips from my dentist and paid $75! I wore them while I slept and after a couple of strips, I couldn&#x27;t believe the improvement of the whiteness of my teeth. I am a heavy coffee drinker and never thought my teeth could get white again, especially after 5 days. The dental hygienist said that they could possibly whiten a little more with another box of strips. They were out of the strips, so I checked Amazon and couldn&#x27;t believe they were only $25, so I ordered a box. The hygienist, also said that if I treat my teeth one night a month, it should keep my teeth white. She told me that is what she does.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful!!!!  The longer you wear them, the easier they come off.  I would buy again. Very nice results.  My dentist caries them.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I purchased my Sheer White kit at the dentist office, and I came to Amazon to read some reviews and check out the price.  Amazon does have a great price on these...I paid $20 at the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While these strips are amazing at staying put on your teeth, they do have a few problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The strips are huge! My teeth are on the slightly smaller side, so the first time I used a strip I could barely talk due to the excessive amount of material in my mouth. I&#x27;ve since started cutting each strip in half length-wise and it&#x27;s plenty to cover all of my teeth and wrap around slightly to the back. In a way, this is actually a good thing because I get double the use from a single strip, but it can be a process to cut them, as the gel sticks to the scissors a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I used these for 6 days straight on only my top teeth so I could monitor the whitening progress, and sadly, there was hardly any difference at all. I wore mine during the day for 2-3 hours each time. They feel like they&#x27;re working, but the end result was dismal. I am not a smoker, I don&#x27;t drink red wine, I&#x27;m not really a cola drinker, but I do enjoy a cup of coffee each morning, and my goal was simply to brighten my fairly white teeth. I feel the Sheer Whites did not achieve this for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) I feel consumers should also know these are made in China which did make me a bit hesitant. The Crest strips are made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my Sheer White results were not so great, I&#x27;ve since started a Crest Whitestrips routine. In the past, I&#x27;ve always been happy with the results from Crest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still plan to use all of my remaining Sheer White strips for a once-a-week touch-up. I just don&#x27;t think these have enough KICK to them to really WHITEN the teeth like the Crest Strips do, but I think the Sheer White strips will be excellent for weekly whitening maintenance after I finish my whitening routine.</li>
    <li> These are not for humans...I think they are for horses! They are insanely huge and take up over half of the roof of my mouth...I can&#x27;t imagine it&#x27;s healthy for that!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this teeth whitener product.  Absolute best that I&#x27;ve tried so far. You can see a difference in your teeth after one application.  Works best when you apply before bed and leave on overnight.  Product doesn&#x27;t bother my gums like other products tend to do.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Um, let&#x27;s see - my Dentist sold me these for $50. They do work well - I saw results after the first time and I have 4 more to go. They adhere well and don&#x27;t slip around. My teeth are too sensitive to keep them on all night, so I just wear them for 3 hours. I noticed a little sensitivity afterwards, but nothing crazy or alarming. They work better than Crest Whitestrips for me - and are actually cheaper if you buy them here on Amazon and don&#x27;t get ripped off by a Dentist.</li>
    <li> I used the 5 day kit as directed. It was easy and non messy. I bought it for much less then my dentist is selling it for, My teeth are totally white. Buy this I say and I have tried many, even a $250.00 kit from my dentist.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my dentist. I purchased from him (at a much higher price) and was happy to find this product at a much lower price on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For an at home whiting product the results are excellent. Of course, it&#x27;s not like a professional whitening you would receive at the the dentist, but there is a noticible difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super easy to use. I use them at night while I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is there is some what of a sensitivity to cold after using but it goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, well worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought these at the dentist for the first time and they really work. I have been using them for a few years now and noticed with the last box that the strips get more gummy and stick together easier. I&#x27;m hoping this was a rare occurrence and they aren&#x27;t this way with the next box.</li>
    <li> Use these every night after you get your teeth cleaned at the dentist. Amazing results.</li>
    <li> My teeth were stained from years of drinking coffee and they were visibly yellow. I decided to order these because these are the white strips that my dentist office sells as a whitener so I decided to give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and put the strips on at night after brushing and flossing my teeth (it is very important to floss so you don&#x27;t have uneven results).  The taste was OK to me and I didn&#x27;t find it to be unpleasant at all. It is kind of hard to talk if these are in, so I do it right before bed.  They strips stayed in place all night and I didn&#x27;t drool much at all!  I was VERY VERY impressed with the results! I could see a difference after just the first night!  After using the entire box - my teeth look amazing!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to do a box every 6 months or so for maintenance - I am just so happy with these strips!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say that I would buy this item again.  After using it my teeth became very sensitive to cold drinks and would still occasionally feel that sensitivity.  Also, there wasn&#x27;t a noticeable difference in my teeth, they seem to be the same color as they were before I used this product.</li>
    <li> Works Perfect!!! Really easy to use.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a few years. It is easy for me to use, and does whiten my teeth noticeably in a couple of days. Really good product.</li>
    <li> The expiration date is Nov. 2015 but when I tried to use Sheer White strips May 2014 they were all dried up. I would never have waited so long except for the long expiration date. In the past I have been very satisfied with the results but not this time. Never purchase ahead.</li>
    <li> pretty good and fast results. strips can be hard to get off if you don&#x27;t leave them on long enough.</li>
    <li> Think I see results .&lt;br /&gt;Whitening not obvious .&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use .&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t fall off before I take it off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A negative review I submitted on a phone case I purchased (Armor Kickstand Hybrid Case) was not accepted for posting and I do not understand why.  I&#x27;m still waiting for the product, it&#x27;s late.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product as it is comfortable to wear, has a great taste, and stays put. I wear it for about 2 hours during the day and have seen some change already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are not that clear, so I went online and found better ones. So that is something the company can improve on. Also, sometimes the strips do not come off easily and you have to really pry them off. And you have to brush your teeth after removing to get the rest of the film off.</li>
    <li> Shipping was quick. Product not so good for me. Strips are bulky and caused some discoloration, which should be the opposite affect! I thew it out after 3 uses. Sticking with Crest whitestrips!</li>
    <li> Same product I got at dentist office, half the price!  Works great.</li>
    <li> These really work.  Teeth are noticeably whiter.  Had some sensitivity when used days in a row.  But was definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> They worked OK not great</li>
    <li> I was robbed.  3 dry strips, 4 missing strips, 3 useable strips.  The usable strips stayed in place and did a fair whitening but a real disappointment to be cheated out of a complete set of strips.  The expiration date was Jan 2017.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this left my teeth extremely sensitive after the first use; however I could see that it works. I have used a couple other products that have worked better for me bothin whitening and pain free. I will not purchase this product again but only due to the sensitivity issue.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of whitening strips out there and most of them get your teeth nice and white. What made this one different for me is the strip itself.  Most strips are thin, flimsy, and they go all slimy in your mouth, not this one.  The strip is substantial and almost wax like, it form fits to your teeth forming a nice seal.  And since it&#x27;s not flimsy and seals so well, there&#x27;s very little leakage that you have to taste while you wait.  If there was anything negative at all is you do have to leave these in for a couple of hours, but they fit so well I don&#x27;t mind. And the price was good as well.</li>
    <li> The product is good, however, the box had been tampered with and came incomplete with 4 sets of strips rather than the original 5 that should be in the package.</li>
    <li> I truly believe that these strips DO WORK! They made my smile so much whiter and brighter! Not to mention the fact that they are minty tasting unlike most whitening strips that taste nasty!!! AND they work in five days which is so fast! However, I did not think I have sensitive teeth but the first night I used them they caused me pain and sensitivity in one of my teeth. Might just be me, but if you have sensitive teeth I would recommend keeping the strips on for the two hour period instead of overnight! The only reason I gave them four stars is because a couple of strips (on the same side) had hardened. One completely ripped and rendered itself unusable while two others I was able to still get use out of. This was mildly frustrating. The only thing I can think of that might have caused this is maybe the temperature change while being shipped. It is recommended that you refrigerate this product and maybe the heat during transport caused some issues, I am not sure. I was also weary when buying them for such a GREAT price because I expected them to be expired... the three I received had an expiration date of November 2015! I would still absolutely recommend these--best white strips I have come by!</li>
    <li> This whitening system worked better than any I have tried! I could see a difference after the first use. I will purchase more.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Bought at my dentist for $40. Used for the 1st time last night (overnight).&lt;br /&gt;Each strip was easy to apply....wasn&#x27;t messy ..didn&#x27;t have a bad taste. I left the strips on for 6 hours. Easy to remove. After this one use, I noticed quite a difference. I&#x27;m glad I bought these. I&#x27;m sure with the full box, I will be thrilled with the final results. My gums are a bit sensitive this morning but no pain. I&#x27;m impressed...happy with results.</li>
    <li> It made my teeth sensitive after the first 2 days. But the sensitivity went away after about one week. It did give a noticably whiter smile.</li>
    <li> Quick and prompt delivery of my order. I am satisfied with the quality of this product.  The only thing for people with sensitive teeth to know is that the next day you might be miserable.  But at the end we many times make a conscious decision to suffer for the look :-)</li>
    <li> The strips really whitening your teeth. After the first use the change it&#x27;s quite visibly. The only downside it&#x27;s that if you sleep with them, the next day you my have a sensitivity in your teeth. Overall, good product.</li>
    <li> Just bought Sheer White Whitening  Strips from my dentist. I plan to start using them tonight at bedtime. After reading a majority of the reviews, I&#x27;m anxious to get started. Thank you all for taking time from your busy life to write a review. Your feedback on the White Strips gives consumers the heads up on this product as well as other products before buying them and running the risk of throwing money away on something that just doesn&#x27;t work. After I use the whitening strips, I&#x27;ll write my own review.  Thank you all again.&lt;br /&gt;Dottie from Pennsylvania :)</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 2 years and this last shipment has not met with prior standards. The little tool is missing that helped push the strips between teeth and helped to remove the strips. The strips do not appear to have as much product as they used to stay put and adhere to the teeth with a strong grip, this set was not as strong of a hold and came away much too easily. I am still pretty happy with the whitening results and I use only once a week, more on a maintenance schedule.</li>
    <li> I have ordered before through Groupon.  These seemed to be poorer quality - doesn&#x27;t stick as well, doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> Does a great job of whitening!</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist gave me samples of this product. I fell in love with it! So much better than the store bought version. The strips are thick and easy to apply. I sleep in them, but you can wear them for a couple hours during the day if you want. You can&#x27;t eat with them on, but you can drink clear liquids. Works great, noticeable difference after the first use. The cost of the product on Amazon is half what I would have had to pay at the dentist. Planning to reorder.</li>
    <li> These whiteners are easy to use and they really do work.  You have to brush first and really push the strip against your teeth.</li>
    <li> I could see no difference in the whiteness of my teeth after using the product. I would not recommend the product.</li>
    <li> My boys use these before going out and love them.  Causes a little numbness but they work so, it is worth using for the overall satisfaction and whiteness of their teeth.  I would definitely recommend these white strips.</li>
    <li> Took pictures, they&#x27;re whiter. Going to give it a short break and order another set.</li>
    <li> I have ordered several boxes of Sheer White Strips and WOW!! This product is AWESOME! I previously used Crest Strips, but these surpassed my expectations.  I do not have any pain or gum irritation when using them.  They adhere to my teeth like no other and I can wear them for hours. This is definitely the band I will stick with. I am a heavy coffee drinker and these strips keep my teeth white. Can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
</ol>
