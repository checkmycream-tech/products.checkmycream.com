<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> ...it really puts out some pretty HOT steam. You honestly have to be pretty careful, so not to get burned by the steam. But...I would rather have a facial steamer that puts out lots of warm steam (which it definitely does) than one that does not. I personally take a towel and drape it over my head and the face of the steamer to sort of trap the steam..but still keeping about a foot of distance between my face and the steamer. I&#x27;m still giving this facial steamer 5 stars because it&#x27;s very well made and powerful for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> I really like this facial steamer.  It heats quickly and really puts out a good flow of steam.</li>
    <li> Great steamer -- you kind of have to hover above the unit because the steam coming out is so hot you&#x27;ll burn your nose-hairs if you get too close! The power cord could be a little longer and the unit is fairly large, but we love it!</li>
    <li> The steamer broke immediately. CacheBeauty told me to call Kaz directly (Since I had bought it more than 30 days before they were not responsible anymore). Unfortunately Kaz does not produce this product anymore so they couldn&#x27;t do anything either.  If I were you I would rather buy the Conair Facial Sauna, Conair is still producing it.</li>
    <li> There was a mixture of positives and negatives on this so I took a gamble and got it.  It was shipped decently fast.  The structure is shoddy, the entire contraption&#x27;s made from plastic.  The hood that directs the steam is also very thin plastic.  The tank that holds the water is heavier plastic, it looks like metal in the picture. But it works nicely.  I live in New Jersey so I thought I would have pretty hard water and didn&#x27;t add any salt to the water.  I got a very small steam trickle.  Then I added 4 teaspoons of salt, mixed well, and got a powerful steam that can steam my entire face at once, which saves a lot of time having to move my head side to side.  I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;ll last given the cheap material.  Also, it comes with a pamphlet that lets you buy replacement parts.  The steamer is $6, the tank and hood is $4 each, so the total is only $14 which is a lot cheaper than what Amazon charges.  I waver between a 3 to 4 given the cheap material and expensive product, but good steaming.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading reviews of some of the cheaper units in stores and not being impressed with how often they would break or the little amount of steam they give off.    This product works amazingly well. I needed to add a significant number of pinches of salt but then after stirring (I lift the whole unit and shake it around to stir) it creates a great amount of steam. The unit is very simply made but is extremely well made. Nothing fancy to break, not dangerous, and does the job well. I&#x27;m very very pleased.    I have found I need to use moisturizer significantly less as the steam facial hydrates my skin (I try and use it every night but usually don&#x27;t bother a night or two of the week). It&#x27;s incredibly useful for cleaning out pores. I&#x27;ve been using an oil-cleansing routine instead of commercial cleansers for awhile now but you need to use a washcloth at the end to steam your face and get the oils to release from your skin. The hot washcloth works but this works sooo much better. I use 25% jojoba oil and 75% castor oil and massage it into my face, steam for 5-15 minutes with the Steam Facial by Kaz and then use a hot washcloth (rung out) to wash away the makeup and dirt that&#x27;s been released out of my pores onto my skin and my skin has never been better in my life! This isn&#x27;t day two either, I&#x27;ve been using this steam facial for about a month or two and the oil for about a year.     It works great, feels like a massage on my face, is a great stress reliever, and I find doing it before bed (I usually do it while my husband and I watch a show before bed) calms me down and I fall asleep MUCH faster, which isn&#x27;t something I expected but a great bonus! The only issue is finding a spot for it (since I use it everyday I don&#x27;t clean it out everyday like it suggests, I just store it on a shelf with the water in it, top it off and add some more salt, shake the unit a bit and start again).     All in all, I would highly recommend. It was extremely expensive forme to ship it to Canada (about $90 CDN in total) but I&#x27;ve never regretted it.</li>
    <li> Good facial steamer for the price. The amount of steam is good. works better and faster effect with a covered blanket. Wish they could create a higher delivery system that you do not need to bend over the unit so much. Still am very happy for what it does in short period of time for the price.</li>
    <li> The steamer has been working fine since I bought it. It is simple and it does its function well.</li>
    <li> This is a good facial steamer but it does have some limitations.  I personally think that it gets too hot so I have to keep moving the steamer farther away or closer to my face while I&#x27;m holding it.  I have to either stand up or hold the unit in my hands while using it so the steam doesn&#x27;t burn my skin.  I really wish that had a temperature setting.  I guess that it could be controlled by the level of salt that is added but that is just a hassle.  It does produce alot of steam and it does heat up rather quickly.   It also has a large opening but it gets to hot to hold your face really close to take advantage of it.  I&#x27;m not sure if I would repurchase this machine again if mine broke.  I would like to be able to get a good steam while keeping my face in the steamer without my face being burned.</li>
    <li> This item arrived and is a piece of cheap china junk,...it was not the same product ordered... and when we plugged it in it did not even heat enough to create steam... amazon is making it right but this is truly a piece</li>
    <li> Gives lots of steam, but I really didn&#x27;t notice any change in my skin. The container is unnecessarily big for a regular facial and occupies a lot of space. I wish I had ordered a more managable-sized steamer.</li>
    <li> Please be aware that Cache Beauty is NOT a company that you want to order ANYTHING from!!!!!  My husband ordered this product as a gift for me.  When I opened it up, the steam facial product was defective and leaked.  I called the company and asked for an exchange and I was told it was over 30 days since it had been ordered and they REFUSED to exchange it.  All I wanted was a product that worked and because it wasn&#x27;t opened and I didn&#x27;t realize it was defective until 40 days after my husband ordered it, they wouldn&#x27;t correct the defective product.</li>
    <li> I use the other reviews to make purchasing decisions.  The review that I read for this product influenced my decision to purchase this and I am very pleased with this.</li>
    <li> First, thanks to all customers that take the time to write reviews. I reviewed all the steamer products on Amazon and this product had the best reviews, so I order this steamer!    It was delivered in three business days! Fantastic!    I tried it tonight for the first time and it worked perfectly. I live in an area with soft water, so a few dashes of salt were needed in the water for the steam to really get going -- and that&#x27;s okay!    I hope it continues to go this well! Thanks Amazon and Kaz!</li>
    <li> Bought this one and it is great! Lots of steam - a little bulky and difficult to store, but so worth it.Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product a couple of times, so I don&#x27;t know how well it will endure over time. However, it is a REALLY good steamer so far. The steam comes out very hot and even, and it opens up pores well. Used in combination with a good skincare routine, this product will make your skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> It is awesome.  My face was clearer even after the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> I bought this about two months ago and I can really see the difference when it&#x27;s used consistently</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on the reviews I read and found it to be just as others had experienced. It steams up quickly and has a great flow of steam. With the aging process I have found my facial pores to be more enlarged and I hoped this product might help. After just 2 weeks of daily use my skin does indeed have a much more youthful tone. And . . .without the cost of expensive cream and surgery. I love this product!</li>
    <li> Purchased this steam facial for my teenage son who was having a problem with acne.  Not only did it work great for him the whole family has used this for a recent sinus cold.  Easy to use even for a 11 and 7 year old.  Heats up quickly and creates tons of steam with just a pinch of salt in the water.  Much better than the Conair product sold at Target.  As for the teenage acne.  Within just a few days of daily use, I could see the acne disappear without any medication or over the counter products.  Now he just uses it when he has a break out.  Great product!!!</li>
    <li> This Kaz steamer is Fantastic! It&#x27;s very basic--no timer or fancy dermabrasion tools. You just fill it to the waterline, add a pinch of salt (more if you use kosher salt), put in the heating element, the plastic facial thingy and plug it in. It starts to steam almost immediately. Lots and lots of steam. The opening is wide enough to steam your whole face. But the steam is VERY HOT, so don&#x27;t get too close. And the plug gets hot so use it w/a surge suppressor. After awhile, the plug will get too hot and you will have to buy another one. Every 3-5 years depending on usage. (and you WILL get another one).  I&#x27;m ordering my third one now. And best of all, the price of $27.99 (USD) hasn&#x27;t changed in 9 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Looking for the next one, after 7 years usage. I can&#x27;t find it anywhere and its \\&quot;currently unavailable\\&quot; on Amazon. :,( boohoo.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these after using my mothers for 10 years. That fact alone attests to the longevity of this product. It&#x27;s affordable, simple, easy to use, and is the only product I know of it&#x27;s kind of out there. Not to mention the timeless 70&#x27;s packaging! This product gets the job done - whether you are looking to cleanse your skin or clear your lungs you can always count on the Kaz for a fabulous steam treatment!</li>
    <li> Thisis a great product and you get a poerful steam, almost like you&#x27;re in a spa. I love it, And the price is good too. Also, if you want more stam just add maybe half a teaspoon of salt and it will give you more steam.  I use this while cleansing and exfoliating.</li>
    <li> I ordered a different brand of facial steamer a few weeks ago. When it arrived, it didn&#x27;t even put out steam. Needless to say, I was quite hesitant to purchase the next steamer I found. After extensive research, the Kaz steamer had the best reviews and I decided to give it a try. It has been one of the best investments! Results were immediate. The steam output on this unit is fabulous! My face looked 100% better, after just the first use. I highly recommed this steamer for anyone that wants to treat themselves to a spa-like experience at a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> the facial steamer does put out alot of steam,but it pull to much electricity,where everything shut off in my apartment,beside that great facial steamer.yes i would recommend it if your house manage.</li>
    <li> I looked on amazon for a facial steamer and purchased this one based on customer reviews. When I used it for the first time I instantly knew I would also have to write a review. This steamer is AMAZING! It heats up as soon as you plug it in! Steam begins after only 20 seconds! I wanted a powerful steamer and almost opted for the more expensive brands--DONT DO IT! This steamer is effective and more than affordable! Paired with a good exfoliator, and my pore cleansing tools, it&#x27;s like getting my profesional facials done at home!! LOVE IT:-)</li>
    <li> The Customer Service was pleasant with the Toll-Free Number. I have been using the steamer for about 3 weeks, for 3 days a week - and my complexion has already started improving - I have had a moderately serious acne problem for about 14 years - and am starting to actually heal - I have made adjustments for a better sleeping habit, lower stress levels, and have been using Proactiv - incidentally, noticeable improvements started appearing after using the Facial Steamer.    On a side note, I would like to let you know to becareful when using this product as the steam and the steamer does get really hot - and to keep ur eyes closed during the steaming process - sometimes the machine will cause hot water bubbles to \\&quot;pop\\&quot; inside the water container - although the pops of water won&#x27;t actually hit your face, it could surprise you.</li>
    <li> Sorry to hear about some of the bad reviews this was nothing but good for me. If it doesn&#x27;t start steaming put some salt in the water. Mine works just fine and is perfect for what I needed. Put water and salt in plug in, and wait maybe 3 minutes. Steam! Clean up is easy enough, rinse everything out. Nothings hot so easy to handle. Very good price also!</li>
    <li> I actually bought this steamer a year ago from a drugstore and have been using it since. my skin loves it, my sinuses loves it, and I love it! I&#x27;m sorry to hear that some people are not happy with it, but it has worked for me, my sister and my brother.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Really opens up my pores and feel like my skin looks more fresh and smooth. But you have to really make sure you clean the steamer. It&#x27;ll have those water residues. It tells you how to clean it in the instructions.</li>
    <li> I am still a little shocked (in a good way :-). I used the facial steamer for the first time last night for about 15 minutes. I didn&#x27;t need to use any salt as I treat all the water in the house due to hard water and it generated a lot of steam immediately. I looked in the mirror this morning and I cannot get over how my skin looks and feels better already. My skin looked better even without makeup than it did the morning before My pores are cleaner and smaller. My skins feels smoother to the touch. I only regret that I waited so long to try this. I am also getting over a cold so the steam felt great and I felt as though it opened my nasal passages up. Run don&#x27;t walk to buy yourself this fine product. BTW, I didn&#x27;t smell any plastic smell (possibly the cold).</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in my complexion after the first day, and a significant difference after the second day. I also noticed my acne fading before my eyes after using this thing. Highly recommend.Besides having the proper eating habits, this facial steamer seems to be one of the keys to a flawless complexion.     If you suffer from acne stop buying medicine and get this facial steamer!      UPDATE (4/30/10): This steamer works great but it keeps causing a power outage on the second floor of my house when I use it. I add a little sea salt to the water to make more steam.....</li>
    <li> Great for skin, this steamer is easy and pleasant to use. One reviewer suggested to spend $180 on a \\&quot;better\\&quot; model! Why waste your money??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has improved the texture and appearance of my skin in a matter of a couple of weeks. Break-outs are way down. Deep pores are smaller and blackheads are disappearing. The deep water tank makes it easy to use without refilling every few minutes as with smaller tank models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I use this for about 20 minutes at a time. It can be set up so that it can be used as one watches tv, so the treatment goes by as one is entertained. There is no need to bend the face downward, one can look straight ahead and it does a super job cleaning the entire face. The face is to be held about 3 to 7 inches above and over the cone, not stuck down into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foe even better results I highly recommend buying the Panasonic EH2511A Pore Cleanser with Micro-fine Mist for $37. Using the pore cleaner after 20 minutes of steaming cleans out the pores with a tiny vacuum. Using the 2 devices together has been a breakthrough for my skin. It is very satisfying to see all of the waxy junk pulled out of the pores when cleaning the Pore Cleanser after use. It&#x27;s wonderful to know that stuff is no longer clogging my pores!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, if you have allergies or suffer from congestion, this is a great steamer to use to open your breathing passages. When I feel the squeezing pain/congestion of an allergic reaction coming on, now I turn on the steamer and breathe the soothing, hot steam for a while. It clears things up and often avoids the headache I could feel beginning. This is no cure for allergies, but it has made it possible for me to use fewer doses of decongestants and allergy medicines. About half of the time, if I use the steamer when I first feel symptoms, I can skip the pills. I cannot understate the good this does me to use less medication and have relief from sinus pains.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had some other facial steamers.  Works great.  A lot of steam is produced.  I&#x27;ve only had it two weeks.  I use it for acne, my pores get clogged easily.  It decongest my poors and helps face makes work to their full potential.</li>
    <li> I purchased the steam facial device about a month and a half ago and have been using it daily since then. It works great. It has inproved my complexion tremendously. It starts  to generate steam almost instantly. It is very sturdly and does everything that it promises.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I have acne and see a dermatologist to help me with my skin.  I use the steamer once a week as well as my prescribed acne medication.  Your skin will feel so smooth, it is great!  I use it for 12-15minutes.  I only need a few pinches of salt, once you get it going, it works perfectly.  If you want to help clear your skin or just maintain a healthy glow this is a definite, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  The price is the best, for what you are getting you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> I got this Kaz facial spa just because of the good reviews. Indeed it can generate great amount steam comparing to other brand names. You don&#x27;t need to put towel around your head to get more steam. The only drawback is that it uses cheap low quality plastic. Once you open the package, you can tell by seeing it and by breathing in the strong bad plastic smell, and this bad smell can last pretty long. Other than that, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It lets off a lot of steam. The smell of the new plastic can be a bit overwhelming. I just washed it out with a mild soap and dried it off really good. Plastic smell gone. On the manual it says to put a few pinches of salt in if you live in a soft water area. Umm i guess i live in a hard water area because the salt made it really really steamy. So remember to check online if you live in a soft or hard water area because you dont want to get burned by the steam if you add too much salt. Those of you who are not getting enough steam. Put a few pinches of salt in the water. I stress the word *PINCHES*! Very little goes a ling way.</li>
    <li> This is a great buy.  Easy to set up and use.  Works great!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I love the amount of steam it produces and the fact that it can reach a large portion of your face at once. It is also very relaxing and soothing. You must add salt each time to get a good steam if you live somewhere that has soft water, but this is not too much of a hassle. Also, unfortunately the first few times you use this product, it has a horriblly strong plastic smell, but you should be able to avoid smelling this if you follow the weekly cleaning instructions for the main tubular part of the device before using it the first time, and then letting it run for about an hour or so before putting your face over it so that the steam can carry away the rest of the strong plastic smell. These are just small hassles that have to be endured for an otherwise amazing and well priced device.</li>
    <li> I have used this facial steam couple of times since I got it a few weeks ago. It creates a lot of steams after you plug in few mins later. I love to use it. Every time after using it, my skin feels so soft (my skin always so dry). I told my husband that I would never go to the spa for the professional facial treatment anymore.   The only downside is the plastic looks cheap, but for the price you paid is ok.</li>
    <li> Steamer works exactly as advertised!!! Produces large amounts of steam quickly and consistently. 1-gallon water container allows users to have extended steamer sessions without the hassle of refilling. Don&#x27;t Forget the salt!!! The secret of the steam is the amount of salt....Too much salt will make the steam too hot and vice-versa. I wish the steamer had a temperature control, but experimenting with the amount of water and salt allows some degree of steam and temperature control. The quickest way to produce steam is to start with hot water from the tap...this reduces heating time and creates steam rapidly. Enjoy :)[[ASIN:B0001XLSQ6 Steam Facial By Kaz]]</li>
    <li> I have owned this steamer for over 20 years.  Works like the day I bought it.  I have been looking for another one for years for my daughter who used it until she grew up &amp; left home.  I didn&#x27;t think they still made it! I have tried others and there is NOTHING out there like it.  I will be purchasing one today for my daughter for Christmas.  I not only use it for facials, but it is fantastic when I get those pesky winter colds.  5 minutes with this steamer and the coughing stops &amp; I can breathe again. Very easy to use.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a person who wears make up to just inhance a beautiful skin. Than this is what you are looking for. The steamer treats/repairs the skin by making the skin look young again. (Even if you don&#x27;t eat right.) I have been using this exact steamer by kaz ever since I was 16 years old and now I am 58 years old. I am always getting compliments on my make up when I ware very little face make up. A beautiful skin and just a tiny bit of make up and a little powder makes you look like you have baby&#x27;s skin again when you use this particular steamer.    I have not found no other steamer like this one by Kaz and I refuse to use any other. When I wore this steamer out, I tried others only because I could not readily fine this one. But, they didn&#x27;t measure up. And, even steaming your face over a pot of calamine tea doesn&#x27;t do what this steamer does.  Since Amazon seem to be a one stop shopping place,  I decided to see if they had this steamer and they did. My four year drought had ended.    Now, when I go out, people are always complimenting me on my skin or my age with amazement. I am just happy I found this steamer again.    One thing I can guarantee is that you will look a lot better than you would have had you not use this product.</li>
    <li> I have been into skincare for quite some time and consider myself fairly knowledgeable on how to take care of my skin. I used to steam my face the old fashioned way by boiling a large pot of water, and placing my face over the steaming hot water with a towel covering my head in order to entrap the heat. This worked well but was rather uncomfortable. I was online in consumer mode ready to spend some cash, when I decided to check out facial steamers. This steamer immediately got my attention. I loved the photo of the woman in a euphoric state steaming her face. I had to get it. The other steamers just don&#x27;t seem to compare. I am in love. This is indeed th best skincare product I own. A must have for everyone young or old, man or woman. I live by this lovely steamer.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Easy to use and the effects are immediate. I had troubles with bad complexion my whole life. After just a few applications of the Kaz, my face started to look fresher and more youthful</li>
    <li> The facial is very basic in operation.  The tank is a bit awkward and bulky. In my area it takes several dashes of salt to get it steaming well. But it works well, does what it is supposed to, and overall I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Only gave one star since giving it none was not an option.This product was a huge disappointment, which is really saying something given the fact that what it is supposed to do is pretty simple. Had I seen it in a store, I would never have purchased it even for $5 let alone $30. Cheap construction and no steam output even after 30 minutes of fiddling with it to get the proper \\&quot;salt content\\&quot; for the unit to operate. The box it came in promoted it as a room vaporizer. The Conair steamer I had years ago did not have the huge tank to double as a room vaporizer- just a little concentrated area for water and a huge, concentrated steam output. Cache Beauty flatly (and rudely)refused to refund the shipping cost for a defective item and I am now out the  $8.80 they charged for shipping PLUS the cost to send the piece of trash back to them. Terrible customer service and a terrible product. Shop elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I purchased Steam Facial By Kaz recently and use it every week.  I like it!</li>
    <li> I actually bought this for my wife. I read the other reviews on this product and liked what I read, but I was kind of worry about the complaints about the horrible rubber smell.  My wife is very sensitive to strong odor/smell, it gives her horrible migraines, but I gave it a try anyways.  I warned her about the smell before she tried it, she said that it wasn&#x27;t bad and loves it.</li>
    <li> I used to get facials at this spa, but it got too expensive and also time consuming. I don&#x27;t always have 3 hrs a week to get a facial.    After reading all the good reviews, I bought this steamer last year. I thought this was so cheap, I had nothing to lose. What a pleasant surprise! This is so easy to use, just add salt, pour in water and plug it in! Lots and steam. If you don&#x27;t get enough steam, just add more salt, it&#x27;s that easy! You start getting steam less than 5 min after you plug it in, so there&#x27;s no wait either.    I love it and it&#x27;s such a great price. I can just steam my face for 15min a day, twice a week while I&#x27;m watching shows on my laptop.</li>
    <li> A wonderful product. It is made well and does what it&#x27;s suppose to do well. It&#x27;s really relaxing to use and makes my skin look and feel great!</li>
    <li> This is the exact same steamer my mother bought for me back when I was a teenager and began having skin problems. I was so happy to find the same item again on Amazon. You get A LOT of steam coming out of this thing and it does a nice job of opening up your pores and letting them sweat out all those impurities naturally and gently. I have been doing weekly treatments and my skin has stayed clearer, because my pores have really been getting a deep cleaning. I consider my weekly steamings a treat, as the experience is very relaxing and soothing. My skin glows afterwards.   To those worried about the plastic smell mentioned in other reviews, all I did was wash it out really well with plenty of soap and water, then let it air dry and the smell was gone. It&#x27;s just a new plastic smell that you get with any product made of plastic. No biggie.  Shipping was fast, too. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> This steamer does its job properly. But its material of construction is cheap. Still I am satisfied with this steamer.</li>
    <li> I have used this facial steamer about 5x now and I have to say it works well at opening your pores but the negative about it is that it gets very hot and you have to stay so far away from it or it will burn. Otherwise it works like it says it will and I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this item! I can only use if for a few minutes, it has more steam coming our that you can handle. An absolute great purchase!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month now, several times each week, and I love it. It only took a few tries to get the set amount of salt to use (four pinches, as simple as could be) to produce a generous, hot stream of steam every time since. It feels heavenly on your skin, opens the pores, and makes toning and applying moisturizer afterward much more effective. You can feel the dirt and junk melting off your face, and afterward your skin is much more clarified and less prone to breakouts (and I have extremely difficult skin). I stopped using the product for about a week to see if it was coincidence or a fluke, and my acne worsened and my skin was dull until I resumed my weekly treatments, so I feel certain that the progress of my skin is due to the steam facial. I did not find the unit poorly made, perhaps the plastic container is a bit crude, but no part of the machine has thus far broken or given me trouble in the slightest. The steam outpouring does get very hot, but so long as you keep your face at least some inches above the unit, you&#x27;re fine; I personally prefer not to have my face directly inside the cup, as it leaves me free to watch TV, set music on, even read, while I have the facial. Of all the expensive things I have bought and tried for my problem skin, this is hands down my favorite purchase ever. Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants a pleasant experience, and above all, help with their skin! As an added bonus, it does help clear my easily-congested lungs and eases sinus problems; I have a feeling it&#x27;ll become indispensable this winter :)</li>
    <li> I use this both as a steam facial and a humidifier. Whenever I have a sinus headache I fill this up and turn it on and in minutes the room is full of warm steam and my headache is gone. Just remember not to be stingy with the salt! More salt&#x3D;more steam!</li>
    <li> This machine will produce copious amounts of steam instantly (more steam than you can get from a pot of tap water at a rolling boil!). The key to it is adding salt. If you don&#x27;t add salt, you will have to wait a while 5-10 minutes for a small amount of steam. I think most of the negative reviews here are from people that did not read the directions and did not add salt. If you follow the directions and add the salt, you can have more steam than you can handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I love about this steamer is the little compartment for adding steaming herbs. As the steam exits the machine, it blows right over the herbs and you get a complete aroma therapy / herbal steam experience. Some herbs really help open up the pores and encourage the cells to purge impurities. I have been using herbs for the last 4-5 steam sessions and it makes noticeable difference over just steaming with water (and salt) alone. Most facial steam herbs can be found in your own kitchen cabinet. Mint, Chamomile &amp; Rosemary are herbs I commonly use, but a Google search for \\&quot;facial stem herbs\\&quot; will bring up a bevy of recipes tailored for different skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I love this steamer so much more than the fancy steamers they use for facials at spas. Unless they get several of them blowing on your face at one, you only get small areas of your face getting steamed at any one time. I have yet to experience a spa steamer that covers my entire face at once. The unsteamed (but wet) parts of your face get cold while the area getting steamed gets warm and they keep moving it around so no one area ever gets steamed for more than a few minutes, etc. This Kaz steamer has a nice wide \\&quot;bowl\\&quot; and produces enough steam to generously cover you entire face! You won&#x27;t need to keep rotating your face to get the different parts steamed like you do with those fancy \\&quot;steam blowers\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t have time for long steam sessions so I really appreciate this aspect of the Kaz steamer. I steam 2-3 time per month and have noticed a significant overall improvement in the texture and pore size of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-hair in pony tail&lt;br /&gt;-wash skin&lt;br /&gt;-add about 2 tablespoons of salt to water tank&lt;br /&gt;-fill with water to about 1/2 full&lt;br /&gt;-add steaming facial herbs after placing heating unit in water tank&lt;br /&gt;-grab a towel&lt;br /&gt;-intense steam for 10 minutes (under towel, this may be too intense for some)&lt;br /&gt;-gently exfoliate with soft towel&lt;br /&gt;-follow with normal moisturizer (or occasional facial mask or acid peel)&lt;br /&gt;-unplug and rinse all parts of unit&lt;br /&gt;-I kept the box that the Steamer came in (fold in the top box flaps) and just loosely place all (wet) parts back in the box and store under the sink.

Here is my routine:    -hair in pony tail  -wash skin  -add about 2 tablespoons of salt to water tank  -fill with water to about 1/2 full  -add steaming facial herbs after placing heating unit in water tank  -grab a towel  -intense steam for 10 minutes (under towel, this may be too intense for some)  -gently exfoliate with soft towel  -follow with normal moisturizer (or occasional facial mask or acid peel)  -unplug and rinse all parts of unit  -I kept the box that the Steamer came in (fold in the top box flaps) and just loosely place all (wet) parts back in the box and store under the sink.

    <li> I think it works very well for what it says it&#x27;s for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a smell at the beginning, but it does go away after a while. The smell is like any new plastic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I steamed myself with it while watching a 40-minute show on TV, and I could feel my sweat from the steam coming down my jaw and neck. I don&#x27;t really need to stay in a certain position to get the steam all over my face. And after I was done with it, my skin did feel very very soft and bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does its job well and right. Maybe I would like the cord to be a bit longer than it is?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I do have one other thing like some other people do:&lt;br /&gt;In the instruction regarding how many pinches of salt, why don&#x27;t they just use a standard measurement like 1/3 or 1/2 of teaspoon of salt, instead of how many pinches of salt and stresses again it&#x27;s \\&quot;pinches\\&quot; not \\&quot;a lot.\\&quot;  That cracked me up a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, yes, salt did help generate steam. (I have city water.)</li>
    <li> Works a lot better than a pot of boiling water and a towel.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my GF, tried it myself.  Steams up fast.  Amount of steam is good.  I think my skin likes it.  So do my sinuses.  Item is a bit bulky with a large footprint, esp if you have limited counter space in your bathroom.  My GF used hers in the kitchen.  If you want steam, this unit will not disappoint.</li>
    <li> This was my first steam facial and I have been very happy with it so far (a month of usage 3 times a week).  After two-three times I used it, my friends noticed my facial skin looking better (I did not tell them of my purchase of Steam Facial).  My skin got much softer, feeling similar to baby skin, the steam was strong enough (more solt more steam), but don&#x27;t need more than directed (1/8 table spoon of salt).  I also used the unit in the room during day/night which brought more humidity, created sort of spa atmosphere.  Turns off itself when runs out of water, no danger during usage.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews here and was expecting a really good facial steamer but apparently most of the reviewers here were just amazed that this product existed at all.  Its like someone who has never seen a car before thinking that a Kia is the most amazing thing in the world.  Let me tell you, there are many better products out there but they come at a price ($180+).  If you&#x27;re going to buy something for your face that you will be using for many years to come, you might as well get something worth buying.  This one by Kaz is bulky, cheap, slow, and ineffective.    National Panasonic makes great facial steamers, but most of them are from Japan and not sold in the U.S.   You can buy them on E-bay though, do a search for Nano Facial Ion Steamer and you&#x27;ll see what I&#x27;m talking about.  These things begin to steam within a minute of turning it on (Kaz takes about 5 minutes) and the steam gets blown into your face.  You can sit further away and still get the steam making it very easy to use while watching TV or surfing the web.  The Kaz steamer only has a weak amount of steam rise upward so you have to hover your head over the machine and you can&#x27;t target specific areas of your face.     Why there aren&#x27;t more companies making decent facial steamers for U.S. customers is a mystery to me.</li>
    <li> This product is ok; it&#x27;s more convenient than using a bowl of boiled water to steam, but not much more so.  Cheap construction and materials; not sure how long this unit will last.  As another reviewer pointed out, the steam is not projected and you must position your face above the product -- again, not much of an improvement from a bowl of boiled water.  Also, while the photos show you do not need to place a towel around your head/face to capture the steam, I found the quantity of steam insufficient without a towel. The steam generation is not consistent or continuous; you can feel it somewhat pulsing or fluctuating.      Yes, there are better facial steamers available, as one reviewer pointed out.  But note that those will cost $250+, as well as about $65 in shipping from Japan.</li>
    <li> Ok, this is my first steamer and being the little impulse buyer that I am---I now have no idea why I bought it. If the goal is open pores then a 10-minute shower would accomplish that.    But, no matter...(lol).  I still like it. I put a couple drops of peppermint oil in it, throw a towel over my head and I&#x27;m completely steamed out.    Heats fast. Very easy to put together. Directions simple to comprehend.  I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> My mom had one of these when I was in high school. I used it all the time. It&#x27;s no wonder I had amazing skin back then. As I&#x27;ve gotten older, time, smoking, not eating well, and not sleeping enough is taking it&#x27;s toll on my skin. I started to wonder if I&#x27;d ever have great skin again. I&#x27;ve also been breaking out due to stress and various natural detoxing.     Recently, mom was cleaning out her garage and found her old steamer. I decided to buy one of my own. Look, this just plain works. After only two days, my skin is visibly clearer, brighter, and softer. Not only is it relaxing and great for your sinuses, it seemingly erases bad habits from your face. Even difficult pimples are going away. I&#x27;ve also been using it to calm eczema break outs on my hands and despite what the net says about it, it&#x27;s working and my rashes are going down. You can also use it for other parts of your body that need some clearing up.     I love this thing. I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve lived so long without it. I don&#x27;t, however, like that the cord is placed in the front, but I&#x27;ll get over it. Do yourself and your skin a favor and buy one. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Nice for sinuses and your skin! My family uses this for both! Nice for sinuses and your skin! My family uses this for both!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge improvement in my skin yet but it&#x27;s easy to use and I like how the steam feels on my face.</li>
    <li> I received the items today, it was too soon than I expected,When my husband found out that i order the items , he wasnt happy he says its a waste of time and money, \\&quot;MEN ARE SAYING LIKE THAT ALL THE TIME\\&quot;then i used the Steam Facial By Kaz after shower, and my husband keep calling me , finally he was looking for me and found me in the bathroom, and he was smilling staring at me, and i told him i like this,,, Steam Facial, and he laughs saying \\&quot; I MIGHT USE THAT TOO\\&quot;and i said oh no this is only for me he just laugh ,,,after i used the Steam Facila my face looks very clean i cant believed it,, well thank you  kaz,,</li>
    <li> The steamer produces lots of steam with some salt. The hard water in my house is treated, so only a pinch of salt is needed. It heats up fast too. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the plastic smell, as described by other reviewers. Overall, it is a good product for the price.</li>
    <li> the steamer is great, it works in seconds. In only 3  minutes my faced felt very sooth.  My pores opened and it was very fast to clean out the blackheads. I use the steamer 3 times a week and it works wonders. After I steam my face and take out all the blemish, I use a toner and then a daily cream.      I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this facial steamer because I was suddenly and unexplainably faced with skin ISSUES. It has helped immensely. I normally use it 2 to 3 times a week for about 20 minutes. It not only gives me the benefits of healthier skin, but I also like the idea of ... \\&quot; 20 minutes of ME time. \\&quot;</li>
    <li> It works great.....just need to have a on/off switch.  It becomes a hassle to plug and unplug if you have to step away for a minute or two which sometimes can turn into 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> not very good for my daughter</li>
    <li> Great product...it&#x27;s a great way to help care for your skin &amp; but also to help you relax! A great escape...</li>
    <li> If you are like me that look for easy-use, low-maintenance product, think twice.      According to the instructions, I need to add exactly right amount of salt to make it work every time.  I also need to soak the steam unit in the vinegar once a week as the maintenance.  I&#x27;ve contacted the vendor by email and 2 phone calls and the customer service experiences were not pleasant.  And they seem to have no confidence in their production either that they do not offer satisfaction guarantee.    I really wish that someone had listed the above facts earlier so I would not have paid for something that I tossed away and, in turn, needed to make purchase from other vendor!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this steamer after reading multiple reviews on other products. The steamer does an exceptional job. I had this for over a month. The steam force is excellent. It has a slot for putting vapor rub etc. Our whole family uses the product. It steams up real fast. Cleaning is easy. The picture on the box is realistic.  I was surprised as to the amount of steam that the unit put out as LONG AS SALT is added as per the instruction. Good product. Well made . Will buy again..Avoid conair and other cheap products.</li>
    <li> after reading the reviews for this product, i bought it and i just tried it out... and whoever it was that said that the results were \\&quot;baby-like skin\\&quot; was right.  my skin was SOOO soft after one use.  the steam generated is great and powerful, and i used it for 15 minutes and it felt so good to sweat any and all toxins out (which felt like a LOT).  i highly recommend this product.  3 hours later, my skin still looks and feels awesome :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this steam facial machine for my wife. Although I use it too. It does produce a lot of steam in a short period of time. I have to add a pinch of salt to the water, since our tap water in Georgia is very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does double duty as a room humidifier.  By removing the face cone it will produce steam into the room.  A nice addition for wintertime.  It&#x27;s not going to replace a stand alone humidifier but works in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good value for the $$.</li>
    <li> I have suffered with blackheads and pimples for years with wearing makeup and having a T-zone face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This past year my acne has seemed worse than usual with a lot of blackheads, pimples and \\&quot;bumps\\&quot; that are soon-to-be pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to finally try a facial steamer to clean up my complexion and open up my pores.  I had tried a full body sauna at a spa in the past and it worked somewhat but it was expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this steamer based on the reviews and the price and I am very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the condition of my skin was poor starting out, the first few days of steaming, it pulled all of the \\&quot;junk\\&quot; in my pores to the surface on the first try and my acne seemed worse than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few days it healed nicely and my skin is so much smoother and cleaner looking and everyone I know has commented on my improved complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The steamer works fast and it is intense as long as you add salt to the water before using.  The plastic the base that holds the water in is not of the highest quality but it does the job and is well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend or buy another one of these in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> I was in the search for a facial steamer and had to buy this after all the great reviews.  I am so glad I did b/c it rocks!  It only takes a few minutes to start steaming and the amount of steam was more than I expected. (A good thing :)  This is a must if you love doing your own facials.</li>
    <li> It definitely works very well creating steam and as a humidifier, but I didn&#x27;t really see any results as far as clearing up my skin. I don&#x27;t have a lot of acne, just occasional breakouts. It might work if you used it very consistently, but that&#x27;s kind of a lot of work... I probably should have gone with the Zeno I was looking at... but I am an impulse online shopper and liked the idea of this!!    Overall: great humidifier and steam facial, but don&#x27;t expect spa-like results for clearing up skin.</li>
    <li> Great facial Steamer.  Have had it for years and I LOVE it!! Helps reduce pores AND tightens the skin!&lt;br /&gt;Tried many others with aluminum steam base.  They all conked out or the aluminum looked sketchy so I threw them out.&lt;br /&gt;This one also has a larger water reservoir than any of the others and no aluminum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If something were to go wrong with this one, I&#x27;d definitely get another by KAZ!</li>
