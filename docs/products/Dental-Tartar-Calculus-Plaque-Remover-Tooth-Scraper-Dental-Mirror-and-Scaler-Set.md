<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> nice ss instruments. quick delivery</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Same instruments used by dentist and hygienists.</li>
    <li> Scaled the dogs teeth.  They didn&#x27;t really like it but it was so easy for me.</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Good product and GREAT supplier.  We had a minor issue on delivery and so we emailed them.  They fixed the issue immediately.  Tools work well and we are happy.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Used this set for fine point smd soldering. really sharp tools, and cheap</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Great value.</li>
    <li> This is a great set.  Needed the tartar scraper for an older dog. This tool is perfect... great edge.  Pops the tartar right off the canines.  Thanks.. Well made... all the tools have other uses... Very professional set.  I was worried and ordered a single scraper.  Didn&#x27;t need to... This set was more than enough... Great price and super fast service.</li>
    <li> Good enough quality but didn&#x27;t receive the mirror with the set.</li>
    <li> As another review mentioned, these are very good quality tools but one of the tartar scrapers I found is very sharp so I have set that one aside so as not to use it -it&#x27;s lethal. Other than that they are great investment especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Received these dental tools, very quickly, in a nice plastic pouch.&lt;br /&gt;Very reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;Even though I go to the dentist twice a year, I bought these for my own use since I have crowded teeth.&lt;br /&gt;After brushing and flossing, your mouth feels clean after using especially since you can get in between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful since they are very sharp instruments.</li>
    <li> Good tools for the price.  I have used several times to clean out my permanent retainer on my lower front teeth and works well.</li>
    <li> Instruments are not sharp at all.</li>
    <li> These work as expected.  Was able to get rid of some of the tarter on my dogs teeth</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and sturdy tools.</li>
    <li> Bought it to do dogs teeth; Pomeranians notorious for bad tartar. Good quality &amp; price. Love the scraper; use both sides on different sides off the mouth since edge angled opposite ways. Got off thick tartar that stuck like glue once I figured out to scrape off the top layers first. Need to protect the rest of the mouth from the sharp instruments when using force. The pointed ones good for checking under gums. Haven&#x27;t used the mirror yet.&lt;br /&gt;2/20/15 Update:  Just scaled friend&#x27;s 1 y.o pom who had BAD breath-they love her sweet smelling breath now and my 6 year old&#x27;s teeth though she had anesthesia-free cleaning 7 months ago (that didn&#x27;t last long!).  Her gums quite red &amp; puffy, breath stinky so decided to scale it myself as she was due for vet exam.  Wanted to know what vet would say. He happily proclaimed her teeth \\&quot;good, clean\\&quot;. Yay! Just saved myself $500! Have now used the big curved instrument which is good for sides of teeth, between teeth.</li>
    <li> just what the vet ordered</li>
    <li> Really good quality tools.</li>
    <li> I got this to clean my dog&#x27;s teeth.  I had been brushing her teeth almost daily when I have her, but my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t do any dental maintenance when he has her so our dog had a lot of buildup on her molars that I just could not get rid of.  I tried sprays, dental chews, and something you add to the water in addition to the brushing.  The buildup continued despite all of that.  I hear teeth cleaning at the vet can be very pricey and I wasn&#x27;t looking forward to having to do that eventually and I got really tired of looking at her brown molars, so I decided to try using these tools.  They worked great!  My dog&#x27;s molars are white after 1 use!  These tools are a lot cheaper than buying all those sprays and water additives.  I was looking at this miracle plaque remover that was $20.  I&#x27;m going to continue with the brushing and the chews to help maintain clean teeth and healthy gums.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I really just wanted the mirror in this set for my personal use. However, the more I look at them, the more I want to ask my vet how to use them. But, then I&#x27;d have to get a new mirror :]</li>
    <li> Happy with this product.  I use for personal use.</li>
    <li> Nice set.  Covers all the basics.  Durable.</li>
    <li> these will make great tools for your macgyver bag, too.</li>
    <li> Seem strong but handles too long for me.</li>
    <li> The tools are sharp and my initial feel is that they are good quality. The mirror isn&#x27;t a high quality one, but it&#x27;s ok with me since I&#x27;m using this set as dirt-scraper, not for medical applications.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re good strong material.  I&#x27;m sure they will last a very long time.  One thing for sure, they&#x27;re very sharp.  You need to be very careful with them.</li>
    <li> Replacement;  hope it&#x27;s as good as the original....</li>
    <li> Sharp edges and good points for cleaning and scraping.</li>
    <li> nit the quality  i expected.</li>
    <li> Great price for the products.  The far tool on the left seems slightly flimsy while using, and didn&#x27;t have much of an edge for extra scraping, but the tartar scraper came in handy.  We use them for our pets, and it has helped us immensely with oral health.</li>
    <li> Feels heavy and well made, real good for the $$</li>
    <li> Received mine today. I will preface my review by saying that all four instruments had fallen out of the case because they were just placed loosely in the sleeves with no protection on the end in which to keep them secure. One of them had poked a small hole in the packaging and most likely would have been &#x27;lost in space&#x27; (post office space) had they not been delivered to my box today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too early to evaluate their performance since it&#x27;s early; however, just like another reviewer mentioned, they are RAZOR SHARP and could easily cut/puncture the gums of the patient. I plan to figure out a way in which to dull them a bit before I use them. I hope they work out - only time will tell.</li>
    <li> The tools seem fairly good quality, but I have only used for about two months now.  The ends are sharp and hold well in your hand.  Not sure what to do with all of them since I am not a professional.  The price is very comparable to the cheap-o dental pick/tools you may find at any store, so why not get something better?</li>
    <li> Great quality. I use those on a regular basis. I tend to be a little obsessed with dental hygiene. I still get my cleaning done every six month but having this kit really help. It certainly beats regular flossing. Those are very well made.</li>
    <li> Tools work great and are durable. I like to clean my own teeth between my dental appointments and these tools help a lot!</li>
    <li> Price was great.  Arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> Well made and easy to use.  Great pack of dental tools.</li>
    <li> the product is great but the plastic package which you are supposed to keep the tools in is flimsy and rips easily. would help if it was thicker plastic.</li>
    <li> These are pretty much as advertised.  I&#x27;d read a complaint that the mirror fogs up as soon as it&#x27;s in one&#x27;s mouth, but I found an easy solution to that. Run the mirror under hot water for 20-30 seconds, then stick it your mouth &#x3D;  no fogging!</li>
    <li> I am glad to finally get a good set that I can work on my teeth with.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the dental instruments. I have learned that going to a dentist once or twice a year is just barely clean. You really can do the work of a hygienist on your own. I read a lot and learn a lot on the internet. I am not young and receding gums are serious business and I  can see the difference in a few weeks. You can change for the better. The part under the gum line is the most important part for not losing your teeth. Everyone should get these tools. I don&#x27;t have insurance and now feel that I can do maintenance to keep my teeth and gums in great condition.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come with the scaler and that is why I ordered it.</li>
    <li> great price, fast shipping. as advertised.</li>
    <li> What can I say, they work perfect, just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I ordered this set to remove a bit of tartar on my Doberman&#x27;s back tooth. It works well. It&#x27;s sharp and sturdy for the price. I kept the curved tool for myself and it removed quite a bit of plaque.</li>
    <li> Great set. With use, improves on dental check-ups</li>
    <li> After I read about the aloe and peroxide mix on internet I ordered this to scale my 14 year old dogs teeth. They look great now. Still a bit to go but I can&#x27;t have his teeth cleaned by the vet because of his age this has helped a lot. The scaler was easy to use and works just fine. I just did one tooth every day or so. I stopped when he got antsy. I&#x27;m really glad I ordered this.</li>
    <li> Good tools. Bag could be better-kind of a throw away item.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. I hate when I go to the dentist and they spend hours [how it feels] scraping and cutting up my gums. It&#x27;s a terrible experience, so I bought these to pre-clean my more crowded teeth and search out and remove tarter buildup before my appointments. The tools are sharp and professional looking. They work well and are not flimsy in any way.</li>
    <li> a little flimsy, but they work well</li>
    <li> Just got this kit today and I love it!  I&#x27;ve had separate tools before, and lost them, so really needed a new set.  The scraper closest to the mirror wasn&#x27;t useful as I don&#x27;t have anything to scrape...but it would be good for people/pets who have a build-up across the teeth.  The tool to the left of the scraper...I LOVE it!  It&#x27;s a bit coarse, on the sides of the tip, and it helps to scrape fine gunk from under the gum-line.  I did it all by feel and after a few hours, while on the computer, it feels like I&#x27;ve just left the dentist. The far-left tool is thin and sharp tipped, good for getting in-between crowded teeth and picking off what is hidden in nooks and crannies.  I have braces and hate to floss so this is a life-saver.  I also have a water-pick but these tools do a much better job at deep cleaning.  Glad I bought these.</li>
    <li> Not using this in conventional way. With some modification I am using as very fine detailed work in wood carving.</li>
    <li> Received this item quickly, but they were not sealed and the mirror tool was missing.</li>
    <li> High quality, sharp enough to be very effective. Excellent price. I highly recommend and would buy again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to help clean behind a permanent retainer I have on the inside of my lower teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is not anti-fog, so you will need to hold your breath while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes with four physical pieces, which includes three tools + one mirror. One might expect that each of the three tools would have separate tips on either side, but it turns out that two of the tools have identical tips on both sides. The effect is you really end up with fewer unique tips: a longish pick (about 1/2inch), a short pick (1/4 inch), 2x wide scrapers, and 2x side scrapers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in general, I have found the tools suitable for my purpose, and definitely worth the &amp;#60;$10 cost.</li>
    <li> I was glad to find these products in a substantial material.</li>
    <li> The tools are comfortable to hold so everything is good!</li>
    <li> Sharp (be careful!)and look durable, although as another review point out the mirror is low quality. And they could use better package.</li>
    <li> Quality product....good communications with customer service. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Perfect and easy to use.  Started brushing and scraping dogs teeth right when we got him as I do not want to put him under general anesthesia for a teeth cleaning.</li>
    <li> Nice set of instruments for the money!</li>
    <li> great so you can sterilize before use!</li>
    <li> My teeth get stained from drinking coffee.  These tools help me carefully clean my own teeth in between dental cleanings.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality for the price. All metal and sturdy. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I am on a dentist or hygienist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I am is a very busy woman who hates dirty teeth! In between my 6 month teeth cleanings I sometimes feel the tartar and plague buildup. I hate that... these are perfect for people who aren&#x27;t professionals! The handy little mirror helps TONS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I am NOT a professional, but I am very careful about how hard I scrape, my dentist told me if I did any damage that it would be a forever thing, so I am a little scared, but hate feeling dirty even more.</li>
    <li> Quality product. Works well for cleaning teeth. I use them to clean my dogs teeth.</li>
    <li> This came in a group package and apparently Amazon doesnt care bout packing things real well and my tanning solution went everywhere  but thats neither here nor there.the dental tools worked great just wish one of them im not sure name was lil sharper. But great buy for price</li>
    <li> the product was great</li>
    <li> Nice quality at a reasonable price.  Double packaged with a storage sleeve for the instruments.  Happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> These are good quality dental tools. I noticed a little bit of hardened plaque on one of my teeth that I couldn&#x27;t remove with just a toothbrush. This worked!</li>
    <li> Lovet really good quality, perfect for home use</li>
    <li> Nice said just like my dad used to use as he was a dentist</li>
    <li> Solid tools. Double ended tartar scraper was perfect for pushing and pulling outward the spring on the magazine release for a Glock so it could be replaced with an after market version.</li>
    <li> I did not buy these for my teeth.  I bought them to weed vinyl as its a lot cheaper to buy these and use them then to pay for any type of weeding picks.  I&#x27;m sure they work great on teeth too but the price was great for my use.</li>
    <li> Thanks,  great, fast delivery</li>
    <li> For the price is awesome. I love this item.....I able to clean my teeth at least one&#x27;s every two weeks....love them.</li>
    <li> I use these for cleaning my dogs teeth. They are perfect. Great service, too.</li>
    <li> The kit works well for periodic cleaning in between dental visits.</li>
    <li> got a double of one of these... waiting or replacement</li>
    <li> Arrived fast. Dental kit does the job I wanted it to. The scraper works for my dog and the picks work for me!</li>
    <li> As expected. Good quality and fast shipping! Perfect! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I got this very fast..I have only used it once..but it seems to be just fine...my teeth are really close together..so one point could be a little thinner..however..it seemed sharp..to the point that I am afraid I may jab my gum to hard..I am not a dentist..</li>
    <li> The little scraper worked wonders on my older dogs teeth. But if your dog is wiggly and doesnt like her nails done chances are she wont like this either, and it is sharp. Not professional sharp but sharp enough to cut gums. be careful. over all its super useful for the pups that will allow you to scale. I also plan on getting another set for crafting!</li>
