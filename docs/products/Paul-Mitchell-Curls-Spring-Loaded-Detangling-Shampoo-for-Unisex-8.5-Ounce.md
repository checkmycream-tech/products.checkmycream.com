    <li> I wasn&#x27;t very pleased with this shampoo. It didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling more manageable.</li>
    <li> Great product for my curly hair!! My hairdresser used this after cutting my hair along with the frizz fighting conditioner and it was fantastic!! Two thumbs up! Smells good too!</li>
    <li> This stuff works on kids curls helps with tanglesiI wish it had a spray you could use any time.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair pretty dry. I want to buy it cause I thought it is a professional brand for salon but the effect was so awful and it doesn&#x27;t work on me.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner for frizzy, curly hair!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo - it&#x27;s gentle but cleans very well.  It leaves my hair super curly and full of body.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Very good with detangling long natural and color treated hair. I recommend this product to others to try.</li>
    <li> Loved the way it made my hair feel while I was washing. Made it very easy to style the was I wanted</li>
    <li> I was recommended this product to keep color in my hair. I waited the amount of time and then washed my hair with this and the conditioner and the leave in as well. Once my hair was dry I thought that it was just me but my hair was extremely greasy. I thoug ht that I hadn&#x27;t rinsed all the conditioner out so that night I washed my hair again and AGAIN it was greasy. I couldn&#x27;t even stand to touch my hair it felt so nasty. My stylist did not ask if I had greasy/oily hair..... soooooo this added to my already existing problem. So if you have oily hair this product is not for you. I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> The fact that this shampoo is sulfate-free is the key. For people who have fine, curly hair (like me), even a little bit of dryness will encourage a lot of frizz. I live in southern Louisiana, so the humid, subtropical environment exacerbates my natural frizz problem. I use this shampoo every 2-3 days in conjunction with the matching conditioner, and my hair feels and looks great. I simply let my hair air-dry, and some days, I&#x27;ll use a gel or leave-in conditioner. Many days, though, the shampoo and conditioner together take care of what I need. I&#x27;m usually a no fuss, generic does it, kind of girl, but the Paul Mitchell name is worth it with this product. Also, bonus: the smell is lovely.</li>
    <li> Hard time getting a lather and rinsing out</li>
    <li> Great shampoo!  I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday and with this shampoo I can go further in between washes.  I read a blog with this shampoo in it and that&#x27;s why I gave it a try.  I&#x27;m very glad I did.</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  I use the shampoo, leave in conditioner and the twirl around curl definer.  All products work together to make my hair look awesome.  I have tight wave/ loose curls in my hair naturally.  This product helps make the curls more defined.  I can finger twirl the curls and let my hair air dry and it looks great!</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves my curly hair full of body and curls!  I only use it twice a week so it is also lasting a long time.</li>
    <li> A very inferior product -- after using 2X (for benefit of the doubt) -- I threw it out -- a waste</li>
    <li> yes, it doesnt very good at detangling and shampooing, but you still will want a leave in conditioner or a wash out conditioner after.&lt;br /&gt;if you put a leave in conditioner after the shampoo, and then the curl shapeing creame/gel stuff by paul mitchell, your hair feels weighted down with product.&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend if you bought this product, to have conditioner to use during the shower if your wanting to put any after shower product in your hair. Or use it and put the leave in conditioner after the shower, but no other product in your hair after the leave in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;i hope this helps and its understandable!</li>
    <li> This stuff actually tangled my hair more after using it.  I could feel it happening as soon as I applied it.  Won&#x27;t be buying again.  Switched over to Biolage.  Much better.</li>
    <li> NIt has a nice aroma and my hair feels clean and smooth when I am done. Even washing 2x a day did not dry out my hair.</li>
    <li> I have used Paul Mitchell The Conditioner for years.  Enough said.  I was looking for a good sulphate free shampoo and tried this.  Sooo good.  My hair was tangle free and moisturized after I shampooed and that is a feat in itself. Smells great and well worth the money.</li>
