      <li>My husband can not find this Old Spice in the Pure Sport fragrance anywhere, I looked on amazon and found a great deal for a package of three!</li>

      <li>many thanks....</li>
      <li>Women love the clean fresh scent of Pure Sport.  </li>
      <li>I cannot find this lotion in the super market stores....</li>
      <li>Crisp, clean smell.  </li>
      <li>It is a bit lighter and not as powerful a fragrance.</li>
      <li>Old spice has been around a long time, and this scent is not the kind your grandfather wore!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>This should last me for many years.</li>
      <li>Not too &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; for hot weather.</li>
      <li>It seemed to me that this product&#x27;s fragrance was not as strong as the same product that I have purchased before,OTC.</li>
      <li>After Shave Lotion Slash, Pure Sport(Pack of 3) from Amazon.</li>
      <li>I really like the Pure Sport scent.</li>
      <li>when really it&#x27;s a watery liquid that resembles the cheap sprays you can get at any local retailer.</li>
      <li>Thanks amazon&#x27;</li>
      <li>Much more desirable in my opinion than a traditional \\&quot;Spicy\\&quot; Old Spice Scent.</li>
      <li>Smells fine, but absolutely is NOT what I paid for.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Old Spice Pure Sport</li>
      <li>Hard to find in stores these days, but I have always liked this scent.</li>
      <li>However it is not available in many stores nationwide.  </li>

      <li>Family member is Old Spice long-time user.  </li>
      <li>This is old spice with a twist.</li>
      <li>If you are married, I recommend you not get this because all the single women will swarm over you when your wife is not looking!</li>
      <li>new bottle, procured at a local supermarket, identical in all respects except for the lot number (3017905323) was found to contain my old fovourite.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I trade the one I bought in fow new from a different lot?</li>
      <li>/&gt;Amazon won&#x27;t take it back, so I&#x27;m hoping Old Spice will accept a return.</li>
      <li>Strangely, Wal-Mart (and, on occasion, Sam&#x27;s Club) carry Old Spice stick deodorant in the &amp;#34;Pure Sport&amp;#34; scent, but no longer carry the after-shave lotion in this scent.  </li>

    <li> I really like the Pure Sport scent. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not available in the major retail outlets, like Target and Walmart (at least here in Iowa). Getting the 3-pack ensures I can still use it for months to come. I hope Old Spice changes its mind and offers Pure Sport after shave again.</li>
    <li> Great smell.  I have used this for over 50 years and my wife still loves the smell.  Refreshing and pleasant</li>
    <li> My husband can not find this Old Spice in the Pure Sport fragrance anywhere, I looked on amazon and found a great deal for a package of three! He was so excited. Came package perfectly!</li>

    <li> Hard to find in stores these days, but I have always liked this scent.</li>
    <li> Simply superb..got right in time (infact before)</li>
    <li> Pat recommmends Old Spice After Shave Lotion Slash, Pure Sport(Pack of 3) from Amazon. I use it on the weekends and Holidays. Its a great deal and saves money when you buy 3 at once.</li>
    <li> I received this product in a timely manner and the scent that it gives is a wonderful fragrance.</li>
    <li> Good packing and good smell and very useful for gift package and present to friends and family and friends family</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get this aftershave in any local stores so decided to start buying it online.  Great smell and feels great after shaving.</li>
    <li> Please be careful when worn in public!  Women love the clean fresh scent of Pure Sport.  If you are married, I recommend you not get this because all the single women will swarm over you when your wife is not looking!</li>
    <li> The product was exactly as advertised and is excellent value for money. I bought this for my brother and I&#x27;m pleased that i did, he loves it as well.</li>
    <li> It seemed to me that this product&#x27;s fragrance was not as strong as the same product that I have purchased before,OTC. Maybe age could be a factor since I cannot find it over OTC anywhere.</li>
    <li> I am happy with the quality and the time in which it was shipped to me.  I would always be happy again and again to do business with this supplier. Hemant Patel  I am a very happy satisfied customer for this business!</li>
    <li> All three bottles are identical to others i have purchased.&lt;br /&gt;These three are labled on the bottom 2325905323, which I assume is the lot number.&lt;br /&gt;All three have blue rahter than collourless fluid with a steong and unpleasant fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;A new bottle, procured at a local supermarket, identical in all respects except for the lot number (3017905323) was found to contain my old fovourite.&lt;br /&gt;Can I trade the one I bought in fow new from a different lot?</li>
    <li> Hi....I cannot find this lotion in the super market stores....I&#x27;ve used it ever since I began shaving....don&#x27;t know why they discontinued it....It is readily available on line....many thanks....Jim</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why this Old Spice brand (now sold by Procter &amp; Gamble) is called &amp;#34;Classic&amp;#34; since the &amp;#34;Pure Sport&amp;#34; scent is not the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; (original) Old Spice fragrance, but for some reason it has been increasingly difficult to find the Old Spice &amp;#34;Pure Sport&amp;#34; scent in retail outlets in southern Ohio for about the past two years.

Fortunately, Amazon provides an alternative source at a pretty good price.</li>
    <li> The title says it&#x27;s an \\&quot;After Shave Lotion,\\&quot; when really it&#x27;s a watery liquid that resembles the cheap sprays you can get at any local retailer. Smells fine, but absolutely is NOT what I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon won&#x27;t take it back, so I&#x27;m hoping Old Spice will accept a return.</li>
    <li> This is old spice with a twist. It is a bit lighter and not as powerful a fragrance. I like it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an after shave lotion that wasnt an actual lotion becasue it breaks me out. this is a much better option it has the sting when you put it on after a shave but it relaxes it away and smells great. would purchase again when i run out</li>
    <li> GREAT BARGAIN...NOT FOR ME, BOUGHT FOR MY HUSBAND WHO USES IT AFTER SHAVING..HE HAS USED THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY MANY YEARS.</li>
