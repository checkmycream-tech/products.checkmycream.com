      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>About 3 days ago, I was about to give up and try something else, I decided to give this conditioner one more chance.</li>
      <li>After rinsing, my hair is soft and beautifully conditioned.  </li>
      <li>The conditioner rises clean after applying, and my hair is very easy to comb after use..  </li>
      <li>excellent for very dry hair.</li>
      <li>It rinses easily.  </li>
      <li>My salon purchase of the pricey MoroccanOil hydrating conditioner was not working on my post-menopausal, fine, color-treated and highlighted, shoulder length hair.  </li>
      <li>this makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>This stuff is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to rinse out and rinses clean.</li>
      <li>and it makes his hair lay smooth.</li>
      <li>my hair was smooth, frizz free when I woke this morning.</li>
      <li>I noticed more shedding with this conditioner compared to those products but still good overall.</li>
      <li>But nothing special.</li>
      <li>This conditioner has worked well for me - I have fewer split ends, fewer snarls and the overall feel is quite good.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  </li>
      <li>super soft and amazingly silky.</li>
      <li>This is better than most staying in my hair for the day but not that much better than other mid-class products.</li>
      <li>As far as it&#x27;s conditioning ability, it was ok.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and it helps make the curls soft.</li>
      <li>the results were amazing when i flat ironed.</li>
      <li>I have long, dyed, medium brown straight hair that appears healthy and shiny (when I&#x27;m taking care of it and making sure</li>
      <li>I moisture condition it, eat right, and wear a hat in the sun).</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair soft and easy to comb out after shampooing.</li>
      <li>My hair, although I do realize that everyone&#x27;s hair is completely different and what may work for one may not work for others) is very, very soft after each use and I love it!</li>
      <li>When I run out and have to go back to using cheaper drug store brand conditioners, I appreciate this conditioner much more.  </li>
      <li>In between donations (about every 2 years), I want to try and keep it as healthy as possible.  </li>
      <li>I am always on the hunt for healthy hair products without all those drying ingredients that&#x27;s typically included in many main stream products.</li>
      <li>I have to say that I finally washed and conditioned my hair as recommended on many blogs</li>
      <li>This morning was the first time in months, that I haven&#x27;t had to remove any hair from the drain catch in the shower.</li>
      <li>I also tried Infusium 23, which pretty much did nothing.</li>
      <li>I honestly believe that this is comparable to the performance of Aveda&#x27;s damage repair conditioner (for MUCH LESS money).</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t falling out enough to really freak me out, but definitely more than normal.</li>
      <li>i am african american and this product was amazing on my hair.</li>
      <li>It helps so much.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on shampoos and conditioners over the years, trying to maintain a healthy, shiny mane.</li>
      <li>The tube allows me to squeeze out just as much as I need.</li>
      <li>and I like to swim a lot-- two things that really put any moisturizing conditioner to the test.</li>
      <li>My hair is soft and healthy, even with all the color treating and daily blowdrying.</li>
      <li>The first time you use it it sort of works and then subsequently it is fabulous- probably because my hair was so tangled and dry</li>
      <li>I like to use this for most days other than shampoo.</li>
      <li>I have color treated hair and the Triple Moisture Daily Conditioner has not harmed the color at all, Having bought all those salon shampooos and conditioners for the past 25 years, I am happy to have found this product.</li>
      <li>For someone without severely dry hair it might work fine</li>
      <li>I have natural, very curly hair which can easily become dry and unmanageable.</li>
      <li>I have purchased this several times, as it doesn&#x27;t give me a rash as most conditioners do, but it is just not moisturizing enough for me.  </li>
      <li>This is a very rich and cream conditioner, but it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair at all.</li>
      <li>Then I tried Garnier Hydro Recharge, which made my hair very soft, but didn&#x27;t do much in terms of repairing the damage.</li>
      <li>This was recommended quite highly and it&#x27;s alright.</li>
      <li>It felt very soft and became less dry, brittle and more healthy in general.</li>
      <li>: Even though this has made my hair soft and silky, it hasn&#x27;t done much of anything in terms of repairing the damage.</li>
      <li>Personally I think it works just as good if not better than alot of those salon products.</li>
      <li>This conditioner may seem costly, but I definitely feel the difference in the texture and feel of my hair when I use it and know that it&#x27;s worth the price.  </li>
      <li>After Chemo I have this super twisty curly hair that is dry and gets frizzy.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>First, I started using about double the amount of product (about a palmful.)</li>
      <li>and wow my hair stayed detangled and soft!.  </li>
      <li>It left my hair very soft,  but it didn&#x27;t really do much in terms of fixing the damage.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>Mine hair is heat and chemically damages, but this product really made a difference after using it only twice.</li>
      <li>My textured hair requires intense moisturizing following a shampoo.  </li>
      <li>it literally changes your hair in just one use to soft silky shiny hair</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>It really does seem to add moisture back to my hair.</li>
      <li>It is so moisturizing and leaves my hair really soft.</li>
      <li>It is not a heavy product like most deep conditioners, nor is it heavily perfumed.</li>
      <li>Back in March, my hair got majorly fried after using Not Your Mother&#x27;s Clean Freak Dry Shampoo for about 5 days in a row.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to try the neutrogena leave-in conditioner next, it was highly recommended by a friend.</li>
      <li>My hair is dry as straw and I have never found anything that really conditions it well.  </li>
      <li>Once I made these two changes, I noticed a major difference in the condition of my hair.</li>
      <li>I generally like Neutrogena products</li>
      <li>I thought it was suppose to condition it, not dry it out!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried countless conditioners trying to get the same effect that that old Clairol conditioner gave me.  </li>
      <li>My hair is normally very oily, but after using the dry shampoo, it became like straw, very dry, brittle, and was falling out.</li>

    <li> This is a great conditioner.  I grow my hair out to donate, so it gets really long.  In between donations (about every 2 years), I want to try and keep it as healthy as possible.  I usually use Aveda products, but that was getting to be too expensive.  I generally like Neutrogena products so I gave this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great!  It is so moisturizing and leaves my hair really soft. I honestly believe that this is comparable to the performance of Aveda&#x27;s damage repair conditioner (for MUCH LESS money).</li>
    <li> My hair is dry as straw and I have never found anything that really conditions it well.  This is better than most staying in my hair for the day but not that much better than other mid-class products.</li>
    <li> i am african american and this product was amazing on my hair. i left the conditioner in for a long time, like 3 hours without any heat. the results were amazing when i flat ironed. super soft and amazingly silky. this is a well priced conditioner with great results and definitely worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> Terrific! My husband loves to mingle his sinews thru it...</li>
    <li> This conditioner reminds me of a conditioner that Clairol used to make years ago, but which has been discontinued. I&#x27;ve tried countless conditioners trying to get the same effect that that old Clairol conditioner gave me.  I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on shampoos and conditioners over the years, trying to maintain a healthy, shiny mane. That&#x27;s hard to do when you get older and dye your already dry hair. This helps restore a healthier look to my hair and a sleekness, if that makes sense, after drying my wet hair. It really does seem to add moisture back to my hair. Sometimes, after my hair is dry, and in between shampoos, I put a dollup on my hands and rub them together and add to the ends of my dry hair, for added moisture. The cost is reasonable, compared to other products (but they&#x27;re all too expensive!). I would recommend to someone with processed, dry hair to give this a try and see if it helps restore moisture and life to your hair. What works for who seems to be a very individual thing. But this is one conditioner that really is above the rest and does work for me. I have long, dyed, medium brown straight hair that appears healthy and shiny (when I&#x27;m taking care of it and making sure I moisture condition it, eat right, and wear a hat in the sun).</li>
    <li> Sometimes, I need to give my hair a break from the same-all same-all conditioner so it can replenish and this is the product I use.  It is a little pricey for the size and quality, but it serves its purpose well.&lt;br /&gt;I recommended for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Back in March, my hair got majorly fried after using Not Your Mother&#x27;s Clean Freak Dry Shampoo for about 5 days in a row. Ever since then, I&#x27;ve been trying to find a deep condtioner to repair and restore my hair. My hair is normally very oily, but after using the dry shampoo, it became like straw, very dry, brittle, and was falling out. It wasn&#x27;t falling out enough to really freak me out, but definitely more than normal. I tried Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Deeep Conditioner, which work great for about two weeks, then quit working. I also tried Infusium 23, which pretty much did nothing. Then I tried Garnier Hydro Recharge, which made my hair very soft, but didn&#x27;t do much in terms of repairing the damage. I then tried a sample of Matrix Exquisite Oil, which made my scalp burn. Next, I tried Nioxin Scalp Therapy, which burned even worse than the Matrix. In fact, my scalp hurt for the rest of the day after using the Nioxin Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was starting to get really discouraged and frustrated. I picked up this product on a whim. I don&#x27;t remember what I paid, but I think it was around $6.99 for an 8.5 oz tube.  This is a very rich and cream conditioner, but it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair at all. It&#x27;s very light. I used this daily for about two weeks. Even though it says on the tube you only needed it leave it in for 1 minute, I left it on my hair for 2-3 minutes and then washed it out. It&#x27;s easy to rinse out and rinses clean. There is no build-up left on your hair. It left my hair very soft,  but it didn&#x27;t really do much in terms of fixing the damage. Even after using this daily for over 2 weeks, my hair was still damaged, brittle, dry, and falling out. About 3 days ago, I was about to give up and try something else, I decided to give this conditioner one more chance. I did a couple of things different. First, I started using about double the amount of product (about a palmful.) I also decided to try leaving it on my hair just a few minutes longer. I left it on about 5 minutes total. I was afraid that doubling the amount of product might cause my hair to feel weighed down and look greasy. But it didn&#x27;t. Once I made these two changes, I noticed a major difference in the condition of my hair. It felt very soft and became less dry, brittle and more healthy in general. You could see and feel the difference. This morning was the first time in months, that I haven&#x27;t had to remove any hair from the drain catch in the shower. My hair is still a tiny bit dry, but no where near what it was. I think within a few days,  my hair will be completely restored and back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Even though this has made my hair soft and silky, it hasn&#x27;t done much of anything in terms of repairing the damage. If I stop using it for even one day, my hair gets dry, brittle, and starts falling out again. I would definitely recommend this as a regular conditioner, but definitely not as a deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years... this makes my hair smooth and shiny. The price here on Amazon is super expensive. Walmart sells for half this price!</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic.  The first time you use it it sort of works and then subsequently it is fabulous- probably because my hair was so tangled and dry it took more than one use.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  It softens, thickens and helps with tangles...I just ordered more. Of all the products in this line, this one is the best.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money with this product is doesn&#x27;t work... It leaves your hair a little dry and doesn&#x27;t do what they advertised it does.</li>
    <li> Washed my relaxed hair with the Triple Moisture shampoo (not super impressed with shampoo) and then followed up with this conditioner and the results were the best I&#x27;ve had yet.  I have to say that I finally washed and conditioned my hair as recommended on many blogs so my results may be a combination of several factors.  In the past, I would wash, condition and rinse with warm water and then blast my hair with cold water before exiting the shower to close the cuticles--well when I did this with this shampoo my hair was hard, so I reapplied conditioner and detangled it again and then rinsed the conditioner off with cold water and wow my hair stayed detangled and soft!.  I also dried my hair by blotting it with an old cotton/rayon blend tshirt as I had just read about not using a towel to dry your hair. Well my results were the best ever-- my hair was smooth, frizz free when I woke this morning. Can&#x27;t wait to try these techniques with some other shampoo and conditioner to see if it&#x27;s the process or the product or both!</li>
    <li> I will not be a &amp;#34;verified purchase&amp;#34; since I bought this at my local drugstore, however, I would still like to make a review. This has to be one of the worst conditioners I have ever used. This stuff makes my hair so dry I can barely brush it. I thought it was suppose to condition it, not dry it out! Awful....don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
    <li> Great conditioner especially if your hair is in some need of tlc. Mine was dry and this did the trick!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, it is a great moisturize, I use while trying to get rid of protein overload. did help</li>
    <li> Love this. My sister introduced this to me. I use it on both mine and my daughters hair. It helps so much.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this product and likes the thickness of it and it makes his hair lay smooth.</li>
    <li> this is completely outstanding ... BUT it&#x27;s wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy CHEAPER at Walmart and Target . 4$ and some change ... no lie .</li>
    <li> I purchase this after used up a tube a friend of my given me.  I like this conditioner, it takes the tangles out of my hair and give a shine.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this several times, as it doesn&#x27;t give me a rash as most conditioners do, but it is just not moisturizing enough for me.  For someone without severely dry hair it might work fine</li>
    <li> My textured hair requires intense moisturizing following a shampoo.  This product does the job.  I apply this conditioner starting at the ends and work my way up.  The directions do not indicate how long to leave in, but I usually leave in for 15 minutes.  It rinses easily.  After rinsing, my hair is soft and beautifully conditioned.  This product has worked wonders for me.  I recommend it, especially if you have curls and/or waves.</li>
    <li> smells great, leaves hair shiny and smooth</li>
    <li> After Chemo I have this super twisty curly hair that is dry and gets frizzy. I love the smell and it helps make the curls soft.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I buy both the shampoo and the conditioner. I have color treated hair and the Triple Moisture Daily Conditioner has not harmed the color at all, Having bought all those salon shampooos and conditioners for the past 25 years, I am happy to have found this product. Personally I think it works just as good if not better than alot of those salon products. My hair is soft and healthy, even with all the color treating and daily blowdrying. Will keep buying for sure.</li>
    <li> Wow! This is a great product.  My hair is moisturized and detangled with just a small amount of this product.  It leaves my hair soft and moisturized.  It is not a heavy product like most deep conditioners, nor is it heavily perfumed.</li>
    <li> A perfect conditioner to use with the Neutrogena Triple Boosting shampoo.  The conditioner rises clean after applying, and my hair is very easy to comb after use..  This conditioner leaves no residue.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This conditioner may seem costly, but I definitely feel the difference in the texture and feel of my hair when I use it and know that it&#x27;s worth the price.  When I run out and have to go back to using cheaper drug store brand conditioners, I appreciate this conditioner much more.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This is the best deep conditioner that I&#x27;ve found. I have very dry hair and I like to swim a lot-- two things that really put any moisturizing conditioner to the test. This conditioner has worked well for me - I have fewer split ends, fewer snarls and the overall feel is quite good. I like that the product comes in an upside-down tube. The tube allows me to squeeze out just as much as I need.</li>
    <li> Luxurious thick cream that works</li>
    <li> My scalp felt good after using it. Didn&#x27;t irritate me. As far as it&#x27;s conditioning ability, it was ok. I like the Shea butter hibiscus  line of products better I think though. I noticed more shedding with this conditioner compared to those products but still good overall. I&#x27;m going to try the neutrogena leave-in conditioner next, it was highly recommended by a friend.</li>
    <li> this product was recommended to me from a friend hair stylist. it literally changes your hair in just one use to soft silky shiny hair</li>
    <li> I am always on the hunt for healthy hair products without all those drying ingredients that&#x27;s typically included in many main stream products. I have natural, very curly hair which can easily become dry and unmanageable. After lots of research I finally happened a upon a review of Neutrogena&#x27;s Triple Moisture Daily Deep Conditioner. I purchased it along with their Triple Moisture Creme Lather Shampoo and their Deep Recovery Hair Mask.  I am very happy with the results of this combo! My hair, although I do realize that everyone&#x27;s hair is completely different and what may work for one may not work for others) is very, very soft after each use and I love it!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!! This product works as well as people say it does. excellent for very dry hair. Restores the moisture and life in your hair. Mine hair is heat and chemically damages, but this product really made a difference after using it only twice. It&#x27;s now part of my routine DAILY. Not much product is needed either.</li>
    <li> My salon purchase of the pricey MoroccanOil hydrating conditioner was not working on my post-menopausal, fine, color-treated and highlighted, shoulder length hair.  After shampooing and conditioning, it was a hassle trying to comb out my hair - snarls all over the place, snapping and breaking.  So, I purchased the Neutrogena Moisture Daily Deep Conditioner and it works wonders!  Leaves my hair soft and easy to comb out after shampooing.</li>
    <li> Works great. I like to use this for most days other than shampoo. Leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Came within a week, was scared that this would be another scam and just wouldn&#x27;t work or make a difference at all in my hair, definitely has just within a week of using it. It&#x27;s great and I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> This was recommended quite highly and it&#x27;s alright. But nothing special. Sadly, it also smells kind of awful. I compared it to elephant dung, but I think I was being overly dramatic. It&#x27;s bearable. Just not pleasant. I won&#x27;t buy it again, but I&#x27;ll finish off the bottle.</li>
