    <li> I really like this comb and I do recommend it. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I wish the handle was a bit longer and I know that many people on here have said they love the smell of the comb but I personally do not like it.  It is  worth the money though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and solidly made. I did experience some slight static during use, but that was only one time. It has been static-free for the most part.</li>

    <li> Very good sandalwood wide tooth comb. It really helps to brush your hear without any static. Great for long hair. Made of very good quality wood. Comes in a nice small box.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is beautiful and a great comb to detangle my freshly washed long hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like using plastic...well much of anything.  So I decided to trade in my plastic comb to invest in a wooden one.  This one is a very nice wide-toothed comb.  Sturdy.  Easy to comb through my thick and long hair.  Smells good too.  Very happy with this purchase. I can envision leaving it to my daughter one day even.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing and does wonders for your hair , the first time u used it j was impressed it had an amazing smell and no wood chipping like others brush and doesn&#x27;t create static like plastic brushes you need to get this !</li>
    <li> Much safer than plastic combs. My wife loves it!</li>
    <li> Worked just like advertised but took a week or so to get it that way.  I have long hennaed hair.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at the size when I received it but this is a prime example of &amp;#34;don&#x27;t judge s book by its cover. This is by far the BEST detangling come ever.</li>
    <li> This comb is amazing.  The wide tines of the comb are very comfortable on the scalp and of course the wide spacing of the teeth doesn&#x27;t pull hair.  I love the engraving.  The comb itself it&#x27;s too heavy but fits comfortably in your hand.</li>
    <li> This comb is perfect for my very fine, straight/wavy, easily knotted, hip-length hair! I always hated combs until I found this one- the teeth are wide enough to actually get through my hair without creating fifty new knots. Love this comb- and the price. I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times and it hasn&#x27;t broken yet (I&#x27;m notoriously hard on my hair tools).</li>
    <li> Glides through my hair so smoothly. No static or pulls, and easily gets out tangles. I have less fly away&#x27;s and almost no hair is in the comb after using it. Comes in a cute little box.A little color difference from in the picture but I don&#x27;t mind too much. Very happy, fantastic quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Great comb glides through my hair when I use it I recommend this comb to anyone who wants to buy this.</li>
    <li> I feel much better using this comb than my other plastic comb. I love wood, and this comb is beautiful! It&#x27;s just the right size and weight. It fits well in my hand and is great for detangling. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> This arrived packaged very beautifully and securely. It was like getting fine jewelry. I used this on dry and wet hair and it works great on both. My daughters and I all have long, thick hair and this glided through. Even on huge tangles it doesn&#x27;t hurt by pulling hair out. There is less hair on the comb than any other brush or comb I&#x27;ve ever used. And it takes about a minute to get all tangles out with no detangler sprays or creams, versus several minutes of brushing with using hair detangler with other combs. I can&#x27;t think of a single bad thing to say about this comb. Some others were disappointed theirs looked different than the picture, but you have to expect being a natural wood product no two will ever be identical. Yours will be uniquely yours! But it looks close enough to know it is the same product pictured. See mine, gorgeous to look at and so wonderful to use!</li>
    <li> Very nice, very sturdy. Could have had a bigger handle. I like it a lot!</li>
    <li> This is a strong and Sturdy Comb with a Splendid Finish, but smaller than I imagined. It has a smooth finish so no snags from the wood.</li>
    <li> Will never go back to plastic. No hair breakage what so ever. Smells great too.</li>
    <li> Great comb, indeed.  Very sturdy. Easy to comb through my long thick hair. The scent the comb has is nice. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. I will definitely be a returned customer. :-)</li>
    <li> AMAZING. Best brush that I have ever used. I have curly hair and need a big, thick brush in the shower that will detangle, but keep my curls in tact. Doesnt hurt at all and the wood is so smooth and amazing, I am a fan forever. Best!</li>
    <li> Not enough teeth… I bought it for my long beard but it&#x27;s not going to work for me...</li>
    <li> Huge chunk of wood, pulls out hair, hurts head unless you have horsehair on your head. Very thick large comb, hard wood.</li>
    <li> Great brush, just know that the color of the wood may vary from what is pictured.</li>
    <li> Sturdy design and no sharp edges.  Very comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> Very well made comb! Glad I bought it!!</li>
    <li> Sturdy and well made, this is a great, long lasting comb.</li>
    <li> This comb is really good and gentle on hair, especially if your hair is thick.</li>
    <li> This was for my 11 year old granddaughter. She has very thick long wavy hair. She absolutely loves this comb. I was very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Looks and feels nice.  Very smooth.  Easy to use.  If you have large hands, this will probably feel small.</li>
    <li> Incredible! I will be ordering an extra one.</li>
    <li> I do not like this comb but am still giving it four stars, because it seems to be strong and made of good quality materials, and it is as described. My problem with it is simply its poor design, but as it is shaped as shown in the photos, I feel that this shouldn&#x27;t detract too much from the review. I just don&#x27;t think this works well for most purposes, as it can&#x27;t really &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; to the scalp. I bought it because the tines are smooth, wide, and rounded; I wanted these qualities to help minimize hair damage. But the problem (which perhaps I should have foreseen, hence the four stars) is that the tines are wide and rounded all the way to the tips, and the tips are so wide and rounded that they can&#x27;t really dig down deeply enough to get between your roots. This is a great comb for detangling ends, but I prefer to only keep one comb, so I need that comb to work on all of my hair.</li>
    <li> Nice wood comb. You can smell the sandlewood on it. I bought it cause I wanted a good wood comb. Not a plastic painted one that the paint eventually chips off and into your hair and scalp which my old plastic comb did. It&#x27;s smaller than I thought, but I still like it. It measures 7 1/4&amp;#34;. I have thick longer hair so it is a it small, but I can just comb it in small strokes. Heavier than plastic of course, but it&#x27;s nice knowing you have a natural wood comb. Will probably eventually get a bigger size in this. But it&#x27;s worth getting for the nice smell and wood.</li>
    <li> Great comb. Feels very well made, smooth, and has an earthy, subtle, almost sweet smelling fragrance due to the natural material.&lt;br /&gt;As far being a comb, I love that it does not cause static when I run it through my hair. If I use a plastic comb or brush only makes it worse,&lt;br /&gt;this comb however, being wood, I can use on my hair when it&#x27;s dry and it does not cause almost any frizz! Thank god for this product. Makes me happy that I found it.</li>
    <li> I went out of my way to select the one with the two-tone wood because I liked the contrast and it would go with a brush I have, but what was sent was an ugly dull wood comb. It is functional (and I would return it if it didn&#x27;t cost as much as the comb), but that is all I can say good about it. BEWARE, you won&#x27;t necessarily get what you think you are ordering, what comes is whatever they grab off the shelf!</li>
    <li> Nice, solid construction!</li>
    <li> I love this very sturdy wide tooth comb at 1st when i used it i was thinking this is so not a no static comb but after 2 weeks or so my hairs oils had to do something to the comb because no i can say it is a no static comb i so happy i kept using it</li>
