    <li> I am so glad I don&#x27;t have to go to the mall just to go to the gap cause all I ever get there is Dream body mist  :)</li>

    <li> Item as described....no doubt it&#x27;s the real deal!  Fast shipping!  Packaged professionally!  Thank you.  I will buy from you again!</li>
    <li> loved this sent will buy again.</li>
    <li> So happy to find it after all these years, my fiance loves when I wear this scent and so I needed more! It&#x27;s a larger bottle than the one I got in the store way back when... Thank you!</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to find the Gap Scents Dream Body Mist as GAP has discontinued it.  My daughter-in-law loves it and I&#x27;m glad I was able to get it for her for Christmas this year.</li>
    <li> and for something lighter than the perfume i luv this one....i will keep on buying these as long as amazon sells it....gap store discontinued this item ....</li>
    <li> Love dream!  Great price but this isn&#x27;t as potent as the perfume but the price is appropriate for what I got.  Happy to have found it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s called Mist but it&#x27;s scent stays for long. Bottle is big for the price and the scent itself is very good. Plastic bottle allows to put in the bag without worrying.</li>
    <li> My sister bought me a small bottle of this perfume yeeeeeaaaaarrrsss ago, I&#x27;m talking 2001 or earlier, along with Heaven (another Gap body mist). I used to wear it during the day but the smell was so light and relaxing/soothing I started only using it as a bed time perfume. Yeah yeah, you may think it&#x27;s weird but I enjoy taking a shower before bed and spritzing on a bit of this perfume. Your significant other will most likely enjoy and comment once they get a wiff of this light scent. I love that after all these years I was able to find it on Amazon. This big bottle should last me a while!</li>
    <li> The gap dream body spray is no longer available in gap stores, it&#x27;s my favorite scent and I get compliments everytims I wear it.  I was so happy to find a vendor selling this product, so I stocked up!</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite!!! I wish they would bring it back and it wasn&#x27;t so hard to find!!! I thought 22.00 was expensive because of shipping but I guess if you want it now you have to pay high dollar!</li>
    <li> My daughter was so happy to get this as a gift because the Gap has discontinued this product.</li>

    <li> i bought this item a while ago. shipper sent me the wrong item at first but responded very quickly and resolved the problem in a very timely matter. recomend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so sad to see this is retired. Great scent ~ very floral, light, and fresh. Hopefully they bring it back at some point.</li>
    <li> Double the regular price. A case of supply and demand.</li>
    <li> After 15 years, still my favorite scent!</li>
    <li> Smell is unappealing and it arrived like it was a used product or refilled..letters missing for the label as well.</li>
