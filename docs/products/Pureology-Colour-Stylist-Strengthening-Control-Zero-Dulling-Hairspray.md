    <li> Hairspray was really really old and my Grandaughter was by me when I sprayed the first spray on my hair and she said&amp;#34;What is that bad smell Oma? I said bad old hair spray.

What a shame it was a lot when you add the two together 40 some dollars I could not afford they are in the garbadge.</li>
    <li> This product holds well and does not seem sticky. Great stuff. This product is not like all the hair sprays on the shelves of the stores. I believe all pureology products are wonderful.</li>
    <li> Another effective Pureology product that delivers with one, \\&quot;SPSHHHHHHHHHH\\&quot;/spray.

    <li> Shame on you Pureology!  This is the worst hairspray I have ever used.  The smell is horrible... not a perfume... just something gone bad.  Not only did this spray not hold my hairstyle, within an hour, the curl was flat!  Later, I could not comb it through without breakage.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. ( I use other Pureology products with good results.  This one is a miss.)</li>
    <li> Hair still looks clean and fresh after using.  Doesn&#x27;t yellow my white hair.</li>

    <li> Love this hairspray.  Keeps my hair soft yet in place.  And it doesn&#x27;t fade my hair color!  Lasts forever as well!  Will keep buying this product.</li>
    <li> Great spray---holds well and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; your hair all up with residue.  It may be a little more pricy than other brands but it is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I love Pureology products.  This hairspray gives great control without being sticky.  It has a very nice scent.  Best hairspray ever!</li>
    <li> Has great light hold and a great smell.  My hair actually moves with this spray.  I also get many compliments on the smell.</li>

    <li> I was looking for a replacement to my normal hair spray, but wasn&#x27;t thrilled with this one. I have fine hair that needs some extra assistance for volume. This didn&#x27;t have enough hold for me.</li>
    <li> Never stiff or sticky it is a great product  I have been using for nine months and I love it</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the produce I ordered. What I got was a knock off, and the top was broken. Life and learn.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s no different than any other hairspray product....although it doesn&#x27;t have a very pleasant smell. Someone told me this spray was good for your hair, but I don&#x27;t know about that.</li>
    <li> I know it is just a strengthening control spray, but I was hoping it would hold my hair style in the humidity and also a little in the wind.  After all I live in Kansas..  It is a very easy to use hair spray and I don&#x27;t know about the strengthening yet, but hope it helps with split ends from the wind.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and its not to sticky you can put your fingers through your hair yet it holds your hair</li>
