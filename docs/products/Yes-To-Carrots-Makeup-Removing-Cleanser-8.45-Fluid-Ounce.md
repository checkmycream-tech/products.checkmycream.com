      <li>it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
      <li>Very effective in removing makeup- even waterproof mascara.</li>
      <li>Nice texture and scent</li>
      <li>I liked it.</li>
      <li>This make-up remover is quite effective at removing my eye make-up.</li>
      <li>Oh my, do I ever love this cleanser.</li>
      <li>I love the &amp;#34;Yes To&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I love the fact that it is 99% natural.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>and my skin looked better.</li>
      <li>Will buy again if I do not find a better cleanser</li>
      <li>It gets most of my makeup off</li>
      <li>Glad this is working for someone</li>
      <li>Its very milky and foams into a nice lather!  </li>
      <li>Smells great, I was looking for a new makeup removing cleanser and read reviews.  </li>
      <li>it did get the blush and concealer off (to be fair, so does water), but it didn&#x27;t really put a dent in my mascara, which is what i purchased it for.</li>
      <li>Easily washed off.</li>
      <li>Also a great price compared to some cleansers such as YonKa which is also a great cleansing product for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>This is great if you want a basically organic mild cleanser that leaves your skin nice and soft and is very reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many different products through the years, and this particular line seems to suit my skin best.</li>
      <li>What can I say -- This product removes everything quickly, comfortably, and leaves skin unbelievably comfortable.</li>
      <li>SO I ALWAYS CHOOSE FRAGRANCE FREE PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>It doubles as a makeup remover and leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized.</li>
      <li>(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:  Do not recommend, it just wasn&#x27;t special.</li>
      <li>I do not break out with it, my skin stays super soft, and I absolutely love the scent!  </li>
      <li>This is also great if you&#x27;d like to quickly transfer all of your dark eye makeup to your undereye area rather than remove it.</li>
      <li>It is very gentle on skin and leaves my face feeling fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>this was a great lightweight cleanser that left my skin feeling soft and refreshed after using it...</li>
      <li>So very reasonable.</li>
      <li>Okay, so first let me say Kuddos to this company and any other that are trying make chemical free products.  </li>
      <li>I first remove the majority of make-up, and then I follow with my face wash.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this facial cleaner.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t given 5 stars because I still feel I need to use quite a bit of this to remove foundation powder, but really this works very, very well.</li>
      <li>I am usually not that loyal to a product.</li>
      <li>I would use it for bare face or light makeup.</li>
      <li>and it removes all of my makeup and leaves my skin super soft and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>It stains everything orange, and doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
      <li>i generally only wear under eye concealer, light blush, and one coat of waterproof mascara.</li>
      <li>I originally brought this makeup remover because its low chemical toxicity.  </li>
      <li>Everything from your drug store standard, to \\&quot;can only be found in SELECT day spas\\&quot;, ultra exclusive, better be prepared to shell out 10 bucks an ounce, 100% organic, etc. etc.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>This product does a decent job of removing makeup and leaving skin reasonably soft and not parched.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The best part for me is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to clog pores or leave behind a grease slick.</li>
      <li>and I like that it has natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>BUT I do give this 3 stars because of the natural ingredients.  </li>
      <li>MY SKINS ARE SENSITIVE</li>
      <li>Tried to use a natural product but this stuff doesn&#x27;t have the oomph I need to get waterproof mascara off.</li>
      <li>natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
      <li>Def worth a try to any curious customers.</li>
      <li>This creamy formula removes heavy eye make-up, foundation, and even lipstick, while making the skin feel super soft.</li>
      <li>I WOULD NOT SAY THAT THIS MAKEUP REMOVING CLEANSER CAN HELP YOU TO GET RIDE OF THE MAKEUPS COMPLETELY, BUT IT IS GENTLE ENOUGH TO USE DAILY.</li>
      <li>And I mean among the top three out of say a couple hundred products.&lt;br /&gt;Gentle enough for morning and evening use.</li>
      <li>Did not really remove my makeup very well</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t had any problems with it after using for several months.</li>
      <li>1.)Mostly natural product, 2.)doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells great, I was looking for a new makeup removing cleanser and read reviews.  Glad this is working for someone but it doesn&#x27;t work for me.  Every time I use a toner after cleansing, my cottonball is loaded with makeup that this cleanser doesn&#x27;t remove.  I find myself washing my face twice with this, and makeup still remains.  Nice texture and scent if you don&#x27;t wear makeup at all, so I gave it two stars.  I&#x27;ll never buy again, though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many different products through the years, and this particular line seems to suit my skin best. I do not break out with it, my skin stays super soft, and I absolutely love the scent!  Def worth a try to any curious customers.</li>
    <li> Received one of these as a gift, and it worked so wonderfully I just had to get another when it ran out.</li>
    <li> This is soooo great!  I use it before my acne cleanser and it removes all of my makeup and leaves my skin super soft and moisturized.  Its very milky and foams into a nice lather!  Once again, thank you, YES TO!</li>
    <li> Oh my, do I ever love this cleanser. I&#x27;ve held an aesthetician&#x27;s license for 10 years. I&#x27;ve tried countless products. Everything from your drug store standard, to \\&quot;can only be found in SELECT day spas\\&quot;, ultra exclusive, better be prepared to shell out 10 bucks an ounce, 100% organic, etc. etc. facial cleansers. That said, Yes To Carrots Makeup Removing Cleanser, is unquestionably among the BEST! And I mean among the top three out of say a couple hundred products.&lt;br /&gt;Gentle enough for morning and evening use. Very effective in removing makeup- even waterproof mascara. Leaves skin perfectly cleansed and refreshed, never stripped. I love the fact that it is 99% natural.&lt;br /&gt;And the price, for gosh sakes. So very reasonable. Especially when you take into account how LONG it will last you. I got almost 6 months out of the 8.45 ounce bottle, and I use twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;Love it, Recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Recently, I&#x27;ve begun to notice that the wet washcloth I&#x27;ve been using for the past 10 years to wash my make-up off is having a harder and harder time doing its thing. I&#x27;m assuming it has something to do with the aging process, but whatever the reason, my washcloth&#x27;s been needing a bit of a boost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter: YTC Makeup Removing Cleanser... This creamy formula removes heavy eye make-up, foundation, and even lipstick, while making the skin feel super soft. Plus it smells really nice (think carrots meet pumpkin) and doesn&#x27;t have any harsh artificial fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part for me is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to clog pores or leave behind a grease slick.</li>
    <li> Did not really remove my makeup very well BUT I do give this 3 stars because of the natural ingredients.  Will buy again if I do not find a better cleanser</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little sad that a product that claims to remove makeup doesn&#x27;t actually remove makeup.  I love the &amp;#34;Yes To&amp;#34; line of products but this one is a complete fail.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t given 5 stars because I still feel I need to use quite a bit of this to remove foundation powder, but really this works very, very well. No need to rinse afterwards. Have already purchased twice from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This has become my daily face soap.  It is very gentle on skin and leaves my face feeling fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> I quite like this cleanser and have repurchased multiple times. It gets most of my makeup off and I like that it has natural ingredients. It also lasts for a few months, so for the price it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
    <li> this was a great lightweight cleanser that left my skin feeling soft and refreshed after using it...but it didn&#x27;t remove my make up. i generally only wear under eye concealer, light blush, and one coat of waterproof mascara. it did get the blush and concealer off (to be fair, so does water), but it didn&#x27;t really put a dent in my mascara, which is what i purchased it for. i think i&#x27;ll just stick to coconut oil from now on.</li>
    <li> MY SKINS ARE SENSITIVE SO I ALWAYS CHOOSE FRAGRANCE FREE PRODUCT. I WOULD NOT SAY THAT THIS MAKEUP REMOVING CLEANSER CAN HELP YOU TO GET RIDE OF THE MAKEUPS COMPLETELY, BUT IT IS GENTLE ENOUGH TO USE DAILY.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this facial cleaner. It doubles as a makeup remover and leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I originally brought this makeup remover because its low chemical toxicity.  Its very good to use as a face wash, however its not for you if you have foundation makeup on - it won&#x27;t remove all of the makeup.  I would use it for bare face or light makeup.</li>
    <li> This cleaned well and my skin looked better. I had fewer break outs. I will buy it again and again. I am usually not that loyal to a product. I used it 2X a day for two months, so lasted a while.</li>
    <li> This is great if you want a basically organic mild cleanser that leaves your skin nice and soft and is very reasonably priced. This is also great if you&#x27;d like to quickly transfer all of your dark eye makeup to your undereye area rather than remove it.</li>
    <li> This make-up remover is quite effective at removing my eye make-up. I first remove the majority of make-up, and then I follow with my face wash. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> What can I say -- This product removes everything quickly, comfortably, and leaves skin unbelievably comfortable. Very happy I tried it. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Not thrilled with this stuff. It leaves a residue &amp; I feel I have to scrub harder than I would with my go to make up remover. Tried to use a natural product but this stuff doesn&#x27;t have the oomph I need to get waterproof mascara off. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I liked it. He is well removes makeup, cleanses the face and leaves no gravity on the face. Easily washed off.</li>
    <li> Okay, so first let me say Kuddos to this company and any other that are trying make chemical free products.  I won&#x27;t buy this product again, but I am still happy to give 3 stars, just because it&#x27;s a natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  1.)Mostly natural product, 2.)doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  1.)It has alcohol in it, and 2.)it burned my eyes like the fire of Gehenna. 3.)I know from experience with juicing carrots that carrots are serious business.  One drop of carrot juice will make a 8oz glass of water tinted orange.  It stains everything orange, and doesn&#x27;t take much.  This cleanser is creamy off- white in color, yet the ingredients boasts carrot juice.  This perplexes me.  If it&#x27;s so little in amount, that it doesn&#x27;t change the color of the cleanser, the company should be ashamed for advertising it so.  If they bleach the ingredient to get rid of the orange tint, the company should be ashamed.... either way you look at it, I&#x27;m not purchasing again.  4.)It just doesn&#x27;t work that great.  It takes me a while to get my Mac mascara off.  I tried it with tissue, and with water... it just takes some scrubbin&#x27;.  I feel like I&#x27;m gonna lose all of my eye lashes if I keep at it.  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:  Do not recommend, it just wasn&#x27;t special.</li>
    <li> This product does a decent job of removing makeup and leaving skin reasonably soft and not parched. I have sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t had any problems with it after using for several months. Also a great price compared to some cleansers such as YonKa which is also a great cleansing product for sensitive skin.</li>
