      <li>but you always want to know if there&#x27;s something that&#x27;s better than what you have.  </li>
      <li>Good buy, worth it.</li>
      <li>It really neutralizes the redness and creates a good and even tone before applying the foundation.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s full coverage and it lasts!</li>

      <li>I have used this product before in the past and had forgotten how great it really works.</li>
      <li>included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad others had such a positive result with this product.  </li>
      <li>Is a light powder that may be good for a 20 year old after a late night, but it accentuates my 40 something wrinkles and highlights the bags.</li>

      <li>I am always trying to find it everywhere at a reasonable price.</li>

      <li>It isn&#x27;t cheap but it will last long!</li>
      <li>If I only use concealer and not this, it tends to have a more dewy feel and shows less wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>I still trying to ajust de amount that I have to use, but I´m liking the results so far.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s natural and not too cake-y.</li>
      <li>Sure, I am not well rested hardly ever, but this makes the world think I am!</li>
      <li>I also use it to conceal dark spots or acne during the occasional breakout and it doesn&#x27;t make the breakout worse and has great coverage.</li>
      <li>, I use the concealer brush from Bare Escentuals.</li>
      <li>I use this after applying moisturizer and then the primer, before applying the Bare Minerals foundation.</li>
      <li>I use Bare Minerals</li>
      <li>The eye brightener really helps with my dark circles.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of the only things I still order from Bare Minerals.</li>
      <li>By far, the BEST product I&#x27;ve found for tired (exhausted!!)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great stuff.  Any time I look and feel tired tired, this stuff covers up those dark circles and no one knows how tired I really am.</li>
    <li> Not a concealer.  Is a light powder that may be good for a 20 year old after a late night, but it accentuates my 40 something wrinkles and highlights the bags.</li>
    <li> I always have dark circles under my eyes and have used just about every day cream, night cream, concealer there is. I use Bare Minerals so I decided to try Well Rested due to the rave reviews. Well, the very first time I used it my boyfriend told me how great I looked that day! I wasn&#x27;t dressed up and I hadn&#x27;t even done my hair! I think this product is wonderful! You just have to apply a little at a time or it looks too white. I apply a white eyeliner on the inside lower lid, I apply my foundation then the Well Rested. If it looks to white I apply a sweep of foundation over it and it looks fine. I also find that it helps conceal some areas where I have melasma. It&#x27;s a great product and it does what it promises.</li>
    <li> Sure, I am not well rested hardly ever, but this makes the world think I am! Being a busy mom of 3 little boys, I need a great concealer that needs to hide my wonderfully genetically given circles under my eyes. This works grand, I use the concealer brush from Bare Escentuals. I apply foundation over this also.</li>
    <li> My favorite eye shadow base.</li>
    <li> I love this product which BM no longer sells in stores or online. Amazon to the rescue, as always!! The bags/dark circles under my eyes are hereditary and, frankly, disturbing. This product keeps me from scaring small children &amp; my mother, shaving years off my age so I look like I&#x27;m actually rested &amp; alert instead of a prizefight victim.</li>
    <li> The reviews for this product were so impressive that I decided to give it a try.  I have my tried and true eye concealer but you always want to know if there&#x27;s something that&#x27;s better than what you have.  In this instance, this product was not it.  I use Touche Eclat (Luminous Sand) and for years, I have been trying to see if there&#x27;s a product that can upstage it.  Try as I may, I can&#x27;t find a product -- this one included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad others had such a positive result with this product.  However, for me, it just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I have only used the product one time, but couldn&#x27;t tell much about it!  If I never used it again, I wouldn&#x27;t notice the difference!  Nothing wrong with the product, I just don&#x27;t think I would spend money on it again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before in the past and had forgotten how great it really works.</li>
    <li> I use this every day under my eyes and it works great--it&#x27;s natural and not too cake-y. My only problem is that now, when I forget to wear it, people ask me if I&#x27;m sick. C&#x27;est la vie.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted and what I didn&#x27;t have time to actually go to the store and buy.</li>
    <li> Just Great!!! I have really bad dark undereye circles and this product gives brightness to your eyes in a great way. A little bit of the product goes a long way, no need to use much. Good buy, worth it. Try it.</li>
    <li> It does just what it says it does. It brightens the eye area and allows the individual to look &amp;#34;well rested&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> X mas present for wife and she looks great with it on.</li>
    <li> Well rested helps my under-eye luggage disappear.  I would definitely recommend it if you want to make yourself feel a little younger.</li>
    <li> I love bareminerals and will wear this makeup for the rest of my life. The eye brightener really helps with my dark circles.</li>
    <li> I´m enjoying it a lot. I still trying to ajust de amount that I have to use, but I´m liking the results so far.</li>
    <li> Have tried many concealer products over the years, and, Ladies, this is by far the best there is. I also use a mineral finishing powder (there are many on the market)as opposed to liquid and both products cover more naturally and last longer than any other makeup.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t fine powdered Well Rested anywhere!  So glad you had it! Good price, too. You saved the day for me!!</li>
    <li> I am not completely in love with this product.  I love the idea of it, but maybe better for younger women.  I am 37 and have a few wrinkles around my eyes, this product sometimes makes the wrinkles more noticable.  I think because of the matte finish and dryness of it.  If I only use concealer and not this, it tends to have a more dewy feel and shows less wrinkles.  I use it off and on, but I am not 100% sold on it yet.</li>
    <li> I use this after applying moisturizer and then the primer, before applying the Bare Minerals foundation. I apply it with the concealer brush, a bit under the eyes, and a bit on red spots (around the nose) and mostly to cover up impurities. It really neutralizes the redness and creates a good and even tone before applying the foundation. It isn&#x27;t cheap but it will last long! Will buy again, definitely.</li>
    <li> I am a long time user of BareMinerals and I just love the way my skin looks with this product.  I am always trying to find it everywhere at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> GREAT for undereye circles, used sparingly.  Also perfect as a concealer on any spots or imperfections...can&#x27;t do without this!  It&#x27;s one of the only things I still order from Bare Minerals.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product before and liked it and was running out of it and needed to purchase more.  Would recommend to my girlfriends.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shortly after my daughter was born. With all the late night feedings, I had some serious luggage under my eyes. This stuff made a HUGE difference!! One swipe and it looked like I&#x27;d slept an extra 4 hours. I can not recommend this enough! By far, the BEST product I&#x27;ve found for tired (exhausted!!) eyes. It&#x27;s full coverage and it lasts! I still have some left almost a year later (I don&#x27;t wear makeup every day).</li>
    <li> This is the best eye concealer/brightener I&#x27;ve ever used. I also use it to conceal dark spots or acne during the occasional breakout and it doesn&#x27;t make the breakout worse and has great coverage. Love it.</li>
