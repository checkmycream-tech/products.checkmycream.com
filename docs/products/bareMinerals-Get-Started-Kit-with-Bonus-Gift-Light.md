<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is truly amazing! I bought this almost a month ago and LOVE it. I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since and the make-up isn&#x27;t cakey at all. It brightens up your face, too! They include 2 different shades which was great because I happened to be the golden color and not the light. I also liked the DVD it came with about how to correctly apply BareMinerals and also about their other products! I would definately recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product. Fast delivery, what I ordered was what I got. I would recommend other people this product.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that I don&#x27;t feel as if my face is heavy with make-up, but I have not experienced any of the advertised effects of this product. My blemishes are still visible, yes have applied exactly as directed, still visible. The brush supplied loses bristles,5 to 8 a day. Over all its a nice product but actually don&#x27;t know if will spend this kind of money for it again! To exspensive for not to receive all the advertised hype.[[ASIN:B001VA8PWI bareMinerals Get Started Kit with Bonus Gift - Medium]]</li>
    <li> Great service , I received my purchase within a few days. I love products. They are ten dollars cheaper than the website.</li>
    <li> I love the I.D bare minerals! i got so much in this start kit really cheap!</li>
    <li> I was always highly skeptical of this product. I thought that it would (a) not work as well as liquid foundation, and (b) would make my face look powdery. But the Get Started Kit was on sale, and all my friends were telling me how much they loved it, so I decided to take a chance. I was so glad I did! I LOVE this makeup. It is SO much better than my liquid foundation. It&#x27;s not powdery at all, it&#x27;s very creamy, and doesn&#x27;t settle in any lines or wrinkles and does a really good job at covering my dark undereye circles. It also lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t fade or feel heavy or create that weird foundation line on your jaw so your neck looks a different color. I am so glad I bought Bare Minerals!</li>
    <li> Ladies this make up works great, I been using this make up for the past three years and no bad reaction. The make up is worth every single penny I spend and will continue buying more.</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;d like to say that I saved at least $11 by buying the kit from this amazon vendor.  Usually these kits retail for $60 plus tax, and there wasn&#x27;t any tax since I bought it from here.  I got the kit in light.  I have oily skin with acne blemishes, occasional acne, slight redness, olive complexion, and large pores.  I&#x27;ve got problem skin.  I had to use more of the foundation than I thought I&#x27;d have to use, but that&#x27;s alright because the coverage is buildable.  Using this foundation with the concealer brush as a concealer doesn&#x27;t do much, I&#x27;d recommend using your normal concealer.  What&#x27;s great is that the brushes, even though they&#x27;re not the best quality brushes (mine starting losing a few bristles after the first use), is that you can add them to the rest of your make-up collection.  Warmth for me is more like a blush.  Mineral veil is okay, it sets the make up and I can use it on top of my tinted moisturizer when I feel like using that.      I really like Bare Minerals, it cuts down on your shine but my skin&#x27;s not matte--some shine still goes through but it ends up looking dewy.  Another bonus of buying the kit here, at least for me:  you get the brush shampoo instead of the primer that you&#x27;d get with the kit if you had gotten it at sephora.</li>
    <li> A couple of people my mom and I knew tried bare minerals and they looked great. It gives a soft focus to your face and it honestly feels lightweight enough that I am not rushing home to wash it off. I&#x27;ve never said that about any other make up. Definitely buy the kit with the extra brushes because you need a minimum of 3 for the foundation, warmth, and mineral veil. The foundation matte did keep my face from being oily without having the caked on look of most foundations. The warmth is a type of blush which in the medium skin tone kit turned out to be a dark rose color - good for winter but not exactly a summery color. The mineral veil does give you that glowing look and if I only could buy one product again it would be this. I am not sure if Bare Minerals has a concealer in their line but if you have any blemishes, zits, or age spots then it still shows through the makeup.</li>
    <li> Yes, this is expensive make-up.  I do wish the price was lower.  However, I have not found anything else that is so good to my skin and gives a natural, even effect.  My face doesn&#x27;t look over-done, but looks smooth and flawless.  I&#x27;ve tried to find replacements that cost less, but I keep coming back to Bare Minerals.  Buying through Amazon saves about $5.  Excellent product that is priced a little higher than I&#x27;d like, but I&#x27;m still going to buy it!</li>
    <li> I just bought Sheer Cover to try and have been using Bare Minerals for about a month now. I am highly dissatisfied with Sheer Cover and the overall look and with Bare Minerals am very pleasantly surprised with how nice the overall look is.  I bought my Bare Minerals at my local Ultra store and bought 3 pieces of it for about 60$ I bought a concealer, bronzer and foundation.   I have been using Bare Minerals for about a month and really like the overall look. The concealer; takes most of the redness on my face and dark circles. The foundation; gives me a great overall look. It covers most of my skins imperfections and gives a nice look (almost a not wearing makeup kind of look) The bronzer: is a little dark but, gives you a really healthy glow. Bare Minerals is completely worth the money spent on it. It give you a much better overall look than drugstore makeup (not that there is anything wrong with drugstore makeup) If you want to try a good mineral makeup, try Bare Minerals, you won&#x27;t be disappointed, like you would be if you tried Sheer Cover.</li>
    <li> Get started kit--- This was actually my Christmas present  to my dear friend . I explored a lot about this product and read all the reviews given and went ahead and ordered it . It was worth the price. The moment my friend saw this, she was very happy and I was hoping the product works fine with her skin tone and indeed it was really awesome . She has a very light, sensitive skin but the product was gentle on her skin. She has no problems using it so far. She started using it and she said that it was amazing... and also  that this was the best among her beauty product collection. I feel very happy to have bought this product. Now just a little detail about the product..... it has a variety of  color choices. The brushes are very nice. It blends very well with the skin tone and gives  the appearance of a very natural and bright skin. Just the thing that you need a little experience applying the product and when you master the skills it works amazing.</li>
    <li> This stuff has really changed my whole view of makeup!  Before Bare Minerals, makeup was such a high maintenance effort.  Additionally, other makeup tends to gather and get stuck in creases in the skin, etc.  I would always find myself having to reapply my press powder and wipe lines of powder off of my eyelid creases.  I never have this problem with this makeup.  It always looks natural and is always so comfortable to wear.  My makeup looks just as fresh at the end of the night as it does when I first apply it and I rarely need any touch-ups.      Also, I have very sensitive, combination skin.  This makeup is very gentle and feels much healthier on my face than conventional makeup.    This starter kit was bought for me by my mother-in-law last Christmas.  This year, I am buying it for my Aunt for Christmas.  Spread the love!      I hope you find this product as liberating as I do!</li>
    <li> The product is awesome and it was delivered on time. I am a happy customer.</li>
    <li> I got this kit at my local Sephora store about a month ago, and I LOVE it!  It is so easy to use (and I used to almost never use foundations or anything unless I was going out to a party or something and even then I was more of a eye liner and lip gloss only kinda girl...) and goes on so smoothly.  I am 8 months pregnant now and have been having some problems with the \\&quot;pregnancy mask\\&quot; splotches on my face around my mouth and nose, and this covers them up and makes my skin look amazing.    I would defiantly watch the DVD it comes with (even though it is kinda like an infomercial..lol) because it does give some useful tips and hints on how to use the kit to its full potential &#x3D;D.   Also I wanted to add that while at first I was carrying the kit in my gym bag, I found out that even after a 40+ minute swim with goggles it stays on wonderfully which is awesome so I dont have to worry about taking it off and re-applying it while at the gym and taking up mirror space.  I&#x27;m thinking about getting the Mineral veil mini brush, but I don&#x27;t even think I will really need that unless I feel like traveling without the kit and only using that to smooth things out on the go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked bare minerals...their product is fast and easy to apply and leaves you with great results. After a few hours my skin gets really oily though, I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s due to the poweder and I&#x27;ve since then switched to liquid foundation. I still use the warmth to contour my face and the foundation powder to pat on my tzone to minimize oil with my liquid foundation...I still love the product and use it...it actually lasts longer this way as opposed to being my primary foundation.</li>
    <li> OMG this stuff is amazing!!! I waited over five years to finally order this stuff.. I watched the late night infomercials with great interest but always being the skeptic and a cheap-a** I never ordered it lol! Well this stuff rocks and the seller had the item shipped to my door im a timely manner</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd get started kit I have ordered and as usual I am very satisfied with the delivery time and the product.</li>
    <li> About five years ago I tried Bare Minerals at my salon and have been using it ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to using bare minerals I had some discoloration on my face. Underneath my lip I had yellowish skin; however, once I started continuously using bare minerals it went away. In addition, I no longer have break outs like I used too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that bare minerals doesn&#x27;t feel like I have anything on my face. I also like how a little bit is all you need and goes a long way. I wouldn&#x27;t sign up for the monthly membership directly through the Bare Minerals website b/c one kit lasts longer than a month considering you only need a little bit. The DVDs will give you application tips. The application brushes are so soft even after numerous washes with the brush cleaner.</li>
    <li> product was exactly as advertised and shipped rather quickly. I love my new bare minerals! great price too!!!!!</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and was just as described.  Even included a small gift card and a couple of samples.  Will definitely order from seller again!!</li>
    <li> I am a makeup novice, but I sure didn&#x27;t look like one when I was done trying out my starter kit for the first time. Mineral makeup always intimidated me and I have always resorted to creamy, cakey, time-consuming products that were not the best quality. I finally decided to buy a BareMinerals starter kit and was pleasantly surprised with the results. I watched the DVD to see the brush technique and what the order was for all the products. The first time was a little slow as I was making sure I was opening the right jars and using the right brushes, but by the second time I felt like a pro and I was able to complete my new look in just a few minutes! I rarely wore makeup before, but now I don&#x27;t know if I can ever leave the house without this makeup on me. It looks natural and feels like I&#x27;m not even wearing any makeup at all. \\&quot;Warmth\\&quot; is my favorite product in this kit - it&#x27;s like the icing on the cake. (Although if that&#x27;s the icing on the cake, I&#x27;m not sure what the mineral veil is!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the dvd was so convincing that the foundation would help under eye circles with the concealer brush, but I didn&#x27;t see a difference at all . I guess I will have to try \\&quot;Well Rested\\&quot; which is sold separately.</li>
    <li> Great product at much lower rate than I had previously purchased straight from the company website.</li>
    <li> Bought as a Christmas gift for my daughter.  She loves the makeup.  Best price I found anywhere.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this kit, but promptly returned it. I can count on 1 hand the number of times I&#x27;ve broken out in my life, and with this \\&quot;mineral\\&quot; make-up, I was breaking out from day 1. Here&#x27;s why...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bareMinerals uses bismuth oxychloride as a filler, making it look like you&#x27;re getting more product and it&#x27;s also the ingredient that some say creates a \\&quot;glow\\&quot;. However, it&#x27;s also a chemical and can cause break-outs and itching, which I also experienced. When they tell you to buff, that&#x27;s because otherwise this make-up would slide off and you&#x27;re basically forcing the chemicals right into your pores!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it might be a nice alternative if you already wear foundation and can tolerate bismuth. I only really need concealer and rarely wear foundation, and could not get a natural enough look with bareMinerals - it still looked a bit cakey no matter how little product I used. There is also plenty of mineral makeup companies out there that don&#x27;t use bismuth.</li>
    <li> This arrived earlier than expected.  I had been debating about switching to BareMinerals for quite sometime and I&#x27;m glad I finally did.  It covers great and feels like I don&#x27;t have anything on, Plus it only takes a few minutes to apply- which is great for me since I don&#x27;t really like putting on makeup.  I can&#x27;t wait to try some of BareMinerals other products.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and it ended up being the wrong color.  It was too dark.  When I emailed them to try to exchange it, they said that they couldn&#x27;t do that. So now I have some makeup that is too dark that I can&#x27;t even exchange!  Last time I buy something from them online.  When you are selling something online, you need to be a little more flexible on returns/exchanges.  How are people supposed to know what color to buy without the product right in front of them?</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and never could wear makeup. That is until about 8 years ago when I discovered Bare Minerals. It goes on smooth and makes your skin look radiant. It is so good for your skin you can even go to bed without taking it off. I love using the pink/red shadows on the lips then going over it with their clear gloss, makes a very pulled together look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So glad I found this. If you are sensitive give it a try.</li>
    <li> My wife just loves her Bare Minerals Get Started Kit. She has used their products for many years and it was much cheaper to buy her the starter set again rather than to buy the separate items that she needed to replace.</li>
    <li> I have been using bare minerals for about a year and its great.  I have no problems with my skin breaking out or drying up.  The starter sizes are great and the brushes are soft and durable.  When it comes to using the bronzer and mineral veil more is less!!</li>
    <li> this has got to be the miracle acne treatment! My face is getting so clear which makes it easier on my cleansers to get the rest of the stuff gone! I love bareminerals starter kit its cheaper on amazon and you need the brushes so get the starter kit!!</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t wear make up, or I didn&#x27;t until I purchased Bare Escentuals.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> The coverage is great for discolorations and blemishes. If my face is the least bit dry my wrinkles look worse. I do not recommend this product for older skin unless it is without wrinkles or very well moisturized. A very light coat works better for me, but by the end of the day my wrinkles are exaggerated. I do not like Mineral Veil. I feel as if I were dusted by a powder puff and it causes me to choke. It also makes my wrinkles look worse. It probably works beautifully for younger skin.    I do like the coverage for blemishes, however. My skin imperfections are magically transformed. For older skin, I recommend a good moisturizer first, followed by Bare Vitamens, then a lighter application of the foundation, and NO Mineral Veil. The brushes are great. The blush is a little brassy and dark for my light complexion, but it looks like I&#x27;ve been in the sun.</li>
    <li> The bra was not at all what I expected ... it didn&#x27;t fit right and I didn&#x27;t care for the style.  I am going to return the two bras that I ordered.</li>
    <li> This makeup is exactly as described in commercials.  It is very easy to apply, covers beautifully and looks so natural, what&#x27;s not to love?  The minerals are light and soft on your skin; it feels as good as it looks.</li>
    <li> I will be honest, so I can give you the best review that I can.  I&#x27;ve been a make-up snob since I was old enough to start wearing make-up.  I&#x27;ve only worn brands like Chanel, Shiseido, MAC, Estee Lauder, etc.  I shudder at the thought of CoverGirl.  Bare Minerals has been around for a long time but I have basically always ignored it because I had the impression that it was just one of those \\&quot;as seen on TV\\&quot; types of make-up (well, it sort of it is sometimes) and would never compare to high-end department store cosmetics.  I also often thought it was too cheap to be good.  I typically don&#x27;t trust cheap cosmetics, with some excepts.  E.L.F. is dirt cheap and pretty awesome.  However, I just didn&#x27;t have good vibes about Bare Minerals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago, a couple friends mentioned how awesome Bare Minerals is.  One of them actually IS a make-up snob, so I decided when my foundation ran out that I would give this a try.  The price was unbelievably good for this Get Started Kit, sounded too good to be true, actually, but the reviews are so good and due to friend recommendations I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am SO glad that I did.  This is not some dinky little starter kit that will last you for a week.  This will last you for a long time and it includes two foundations, warmth (which is like a blush, basically), and the mineral veil, which is supposed to be primarily used on your t-zone and kind of seals it all together.  It also comes with three brushes (one big, one smaller one for heavier coverage, and a concealer brush), and a brush conditioner (the bonus product).  It comes in a really elegant and cute box, which I LOVE.  It holds everything perfectly.  Oh, and it comes with a how-to DVD.  I highly recommend watching that, because it&#x27;s really helpful for learning how to put it on (even though the narrator is sort of annoying).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the results?  I AM IN LOVE.  Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It&#x27;s quick and almost impossible to screw up.  Bare Minerals is really blendable and fluid so you can&#x27;t even mess up the blush.  It&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*You look like a million bucks.  I have primarily been wearing Chanel foundation for over 10 years and since wearing this I have gotten so many compliments, like \\&quot;Wow, you look so radiant.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The price.  You get two foundations, three brushes, a blush, a brush conditioner, and mineral veil for around $50.  How much will all that cost you at Chanel, or even MAC?  We are talking maybe $300 or even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The concealer is awesome.  The foundation actually works as a very effective concealer with the concealer brush and it really is effective in covering up blemishes, scars, etc.  It gets rid of dark shadows under your eyes VERY effectively.  I think that&#x27;s where the radiance comments came from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It feels like nothing you&#x27;ve ever felt before.  It&#x27;s not heavy or cakey...it almost feels like you&#x27;re putting on nothing.  If anything, it&#x27;s creamy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It doesn&#x27;t rub off as much.  It rubs off a LOT less on my cell phone than any other foundation I&#x27;ve worn.  Like, a fraction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It lasts.  It will last you throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*You look like an airbrushed goddess.  And you can totally customize the coverage.  Not heavy enough?  Just add a little bit more until you get the look you want.  You can get the I AM WEARING HEAVY MAKE-UP look or the very natural look.  It&#x27;s up to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I LOVE Bare Minerals and would give this more than five stars if possible.  I am so glad that I switched and highly recommend this to anyone looking for foundation.  And this comes from a make-up snob.  About colors:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very fair, but ordered the next one up (light) so I wouldn&#x27;t look too pale.  Plus, sometimes I tan.  It comes with two shades of foundations, Light (W15) and Golden (W20).  I personally like the W15 for when I am completely untanned.  It is THE perfect shade.  The Golden is a little too dark, but it&#x27;s good for when I&#x27;m tanner.  I&#x27;m loving Bare Minerals!</li>
    <li> Excellent price. Excellent delivery.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using Bare Minerals and I absolutely love it. A little goes a long way for great coverage. My problem is uneven skin tone on the sides of my face. The foundation helps balance it out. The free gift I received was mascara and lipstick. I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like the lipstick, but it looks great! I will continue to use Bare Minerals as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
    <li> I applied the makeup and with in a hour the makeup was gone.  This is an over priced fad makeup.</li>
    <li> Great product, watching the instructional dvd is a must for complete satisfaction and understanding how the product works. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent starter kit and price.  Includes everything needed to try Bare Minerals including brushes and instructions. I have extremely sensitive skin and found no skin reaction whatsoever and my skin texture and condition have actually improved.  Feels like wearing no makeup at all and very fast to apply and go. It creates a &#x27;finished&#x27; look without looking made up. Great for casual lifestyle.</li>
    <li> I love this product and found it the cheapest on Amazon through this seller. Glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 5 years since I bought my first Bare Minerals kit, and I haven&#x27;t stopped since. It is great for my skin type, which is very oily. And it really looks and feels that I&#x27;m not wearing makeup at all. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I had to find a non-moisturing make-up for a diet I am on that requires no oils be put on the skin.  I had seen the bare minerals advertised and decided to try it.  I am finding it very easy to apply, like the look and feel of it very much.  I have to check the mirror periodically to see if it&#x27;s really there, and that I like most of all!</li>
    <li> While this product didn&#x27;t cause me an allergic reaction like so many others, it also did not cover up very well. If I did not have acne once in a while I wouldn&#x27;t use make up at all. For me a make-up defeats its purpose if it doesn&#x27;t hide blemishes!</li>
    <li> Okay, got to say that I&#x27;ve been curious for years, but skeptical!  Now I was shopping for something new, and I&#x27;ve used drug-store brand mineral foundations and liked them, so was even more curious to try the real (orginal) thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I read some reviews here and was worried.  Some complained about \\&quot;not enough coverage\\&quot; or that they were disappointed.  I was also worried about picking the right shade.  So I went to the BareEscentuals website and used their thingie to find the right shade, but still hesitated at ordering.  Finally I came back and ordered here (it was cheaper)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love in one try.  Now I tend to be a know-it-all and tend to shrug off instructions, but I wanted this product to work so bad that I did take a minute or so to watch the video.  I&#x27;d watch one step, pause it and do it on myself, then the next step.  I have to say ladies, DO WATCH it, and it&#x27;s a new thing, so start with less and build up, but the coverage was flawless, the shade perfect, the texture fantastic.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS.. AND WHEN IT IS GONE... WILL ORDER MORE.. ESPECIALLY THE EYE LINER!! SUPER GOOD STUFF</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with my kit.  Although the container sizes were not full size, the brushes were full size and buying them alone would have been more expensive.  This is a great deal to get you started.  It comes with 2 colors (Light W3 &amp; Golden Medium).  For my skin tone, I use the Light.  It blends well and covers blemishes.  I have used Bare Minerals for about 8 years now and I prefer the original Mineral Veil vs the colored Mineral Veil.  I have also used Sheer Cover and honestly when you compare price and product, I prefer Bare Minerals to Sheer Cover.  Another reason for choosing Bare Minerals over Sheer Cover, is you don&#x27;t have to join a club and have automatic shipments coming all the time. I prefer buying when I need it, not on a time schedule.  One last thing to add is that I ran out of Bare Minerals and bought some liquid foundation at the drug store.  Within a week, my face began to break out with blemishes.  I threw out my liquid foundation and started back on Bare Minerals and my face has now cleared back up.</li>
    <li> I received my order just fine, opened the amazon box and the separate items I had shipped together were fine. I opened the BareMinerals box and the \\&quot;bonus gift\\&quot; brush cleaner had exploded all over the inside of the box. Nothing was ruined, except the cool black box the stuff came in, and the booklet. The brushes were okay because they are wrapped in plastic, and the makeup was okay because it is sealed. I had to wipe everything off though, and throw out the box that I wanted to keep. Kind of disappointing for something I spent $50 on though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this kit for about a week and a half. I was amazed at how beautiful my skin looked when I first started using it. The other day, I was exfoliating and noticed my face felt bumpier than usual. I went a few more days using it, and now my face is covered with tiny, rough bumps. Even the soft, always clear skin above my lips is covered with tiny bumps. I am super bummed because I paid a ton of money for all this stuff (over $100.) I guess I will have to go back to my usual makeup (Almay.) I&#x27;ll only use this stuff on the weekends or special occasions. It makes you look flawless (before the little bumps start popping up) however it&#x27;s not worth sacrificing my usually clear complexion by using this regularly. I suffered with acne for years, and I don&#x27;t want to go back to that. I hope that I will at least be able to use this sporadically without breaking out because it was so pricey. Super bummer.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It had what I needed and was at a very affordable price, better than what I was paying.</li>
    <li> looks beautiful once you&#x27;re wearing it. You can see a difference. However, i noticed that it makes me break out. Its very disappointing because i loved the product. I gave it away to my sister in law, but i warned her about the break outs, (hopefully it has a better turnout on her). Would not recommend to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> So far I like the feel of the product. However in the light pack I got a light that wasn&#x27;t really light enough, and a more medium color that I&#x27;ll never use... Disappointed to have spent so much. I still need to contact the company to see if I can do something about the medium shade. I&#x27;ve used another mineral product that made my face breakout and this product is definitely improving the quality of my skin.</li>
    <li> I ordered light kit, little bit too dark, but during summer and with little tan works good. Easy to put on, stays on nice, gives my face really nice look.</li>
    <li> bought this for my daughter for christmas and she was very happy that i listened to what she wanted. she was very happy and with it without it she is beautiful</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product and will definetly buy more when I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;Finished with this set. Bare escentuals is a Great make up line.</li>
