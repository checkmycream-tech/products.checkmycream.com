    <li> Love it. I bought it expecting the clips to be worthless, but I wanted the rest of the kit, but I found the clips to just work fine. Not sure if different people got different clips or it&#x27;s a matter of how they are using them, but I was extremely pleased with them. My hair is very thick and very fine and I still had no trouble. I&#x27;ve attached some pics with my hair in the clips. Definitely happy with this purchase, you get a lot of stuff for a good price and having the little bag to keep it all in is definitely nice too!</li>
    <li> This is a great little coloring kit much better than the random items I use and make messes with when coloring my hair.&lt;br /&gt;If it had 2 more clips it would be perfect...&lt;br /&gt;Includes tint bowl, 3 tint brushes, 2 clips&lt;br /&gt;and a reusable clear zip pouch.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice very good price!&lt;br /&gt;...don&#x27;t forget gloves!!</li>
    <li> I like all the pieces for the price, even a bag, which is very useful. The things are on the flimsy side but a relatively minor issue for me.</li>

    <li> Wow - makes coloring my hair so much easier.  I love the selection of brushes.</li>
    <li> Very nice kit for those who want the salon look at home!</li>
    <li> Love it! So profesional!</li>
    <li> Very Nice with Good price</li>
    <li> Loved it! Great size, dye doesn&#x27;t stick, washes easily.</li>
    <li> First time buying brushes and bowls.. Only uses them once so far. But so far so good!</li>
    <li> I use this every time I dye my hair which is like, once a month. Love everything especially the marked ounces on the bowl.</li>
    <li> good products for the price, does the job</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured and described!</li>
    <li> Good price for its quality</li>
    <li> I did a Do It Yourself Ombre using this and it came out amazing!</li>
    <li> Sturdy and complete kit.  I was very pleased with the brushes, my hair is heavy and curly and they stood up to the pressure.</li>
    <li> Lol, um yah the clips are useless. Everything else is good.</li>
    <li> Very useful and a great price!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and a great price.  I have used this kit over and over.</li>
    <li> Used this to mix and apply my hair dye.  The clips hold my hair securely and the brused applied my dye perfectly.</li>
    <li> I love everything I got for the price very nice thank you. I got it very fast also</li>
    <li> Used it as soon as it got here. Has everything shown.</li>
    <li> perfect home dying kit</li>
    <li> Excellent product! It is of very high quality (for the price) and the dye does not stick to its surface and you can use even the last drop of the dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this</li>
    <li> The hair clips are too loose and whimpy to hold any amount of hair in place but the rest was fine. The bowl and brushes are your standard products found in beauty supply stores and the bag is nice to keep everything organized.</li>
    <li> as described. great value for money and nice quality</li>
    <li> Very helpful, my wife love it and good price</li>
    <li> Great pieces, sturdy, easy to rinse. I&#x27;ve used them to mix/apply bleach and dye [Manic Panic colors] and this set is exactly what I was needing and for a great price.</li>
    <li> The bag arrived with some ripped linings. The brushes were smaller than expected.</li>
    <li> Great product and helped me to color my hair easily without making a mess</li>
    <li> Very nice and good price for the assortment of items you get. I especially like the highlighting brush with the little comb on it.</li>
    <li> This is a great little kit for home hair coloring. I didn&#x27;t end up using the whole kit like I thought I would (first time coloring), but the brushes seemed to be effective enough. The clips are very big and were completely useless for short hair - perhaps they would work better with those with longer hair - although there isn&#x27;t any grip on them so I am not sure. I ordered some Crocodile Clips instead. There maybe other kits out there, but this would be even better with a decent cape and a wider comb.</li>
    <li> This product has almost everything you would need to dye your hair at home. I wished it would provide gloves and the measurements on the container are a little different but overall great product.</li>
    <li> Pros: This is a nice kit to use any kind of product on your hair, and it&#x27;s very nice that it has a bag to store everything.&lt;br /&gt;COns: The clips are useless.</li>
