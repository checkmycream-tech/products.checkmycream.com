      <li>As someone who has struggled with acne and sun spots my whole life, ive pretty much tried everything.  </li>
      <li>The solution is not like a traditional cleanser because it almost feels like a cleansing oil, but it washes away easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
      <li>bottle is very elegant, but I have a hard time pouring the right amount of wash on my face.</li>

      <li>As a 30 year old with sensitive skin prone to minor breakouts, it&#x27;s nice to find a gentle product with anti-aging &amp; acne-fighting benefits in one.</li>
      <li>but it does remove makeup, even waterproof mascara, and clean deep into pores.</li>
      <li>The most funny part of this product is in the warnings section it is written that skin may look whiter and blemished may disappear after few days of use.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this product .</li>
      <li>Within the first 4 days my face had pretty much cleared up completely, now i haven&#x27;t had any issues since i use it regularly.  </li>
      <li>This is my first time using this product and let me say it does work when using this product your skin might look a little whitish as it says on the box so just apply so face moisturizer and this should help take the whitish look away but my face look brighter and feels smooth also helping with my acne</li>
      <li>Breakthrough acne facial cleansing wash that helps firm the skin, smooth fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>It is a highly concentrated product so if you have a sensitive skin please do a sample test before using it on your whole face.</li>
      <li>This is the only reason I have not given this facial wash a 5 star review, other than that the product works great and my skin has only had positive experiences.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This face wash is absolutely awesome. When I received it I was instantly impressed with how big the bottle was. It&#x27;s 7 ounces and will definitely last a long time. I have been using it for about a week now and already am happy with it. It removes all my makeup easily and leaves my skin feeling very clean. My skin feels soft and looks hydrated. It&#x27;s so awesome how many things this face wash does. It&#x27;s a fast acting anti aging, anti wrinkle acne face wash cleanser treatment that helps with wrinkles, age spots, and dark spots as well. It also clears the pores of acne prone bacteria, makeup, dirt, and oils. It gently exfoliates to remove dead skin. It&#x27;s even great for sensitive skin. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my face at all. So face I&#x27;ve noticed my face is clearing up. My little bumps that never turned into a white head are minimizing. Definitely recommend this face wash. *promotional pricing received for testing and review*</li>
    <li> i feel so even toned since i started using this face wash... it seems like my skin is somehow absorbing any and all discoloration, or spot i ever had..</li>
    <li> This is a great fit for my oily, acne prone skin. It washes away the oil without over drying. Paired with a post-cleansing moisturizer, I have seen excellent results. Smoother skin and less breakouts. I feel like I can go out without make up on now, which I haven&#x27;t done in years. That&#x27;s how well this works!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my cousin because she has a lot of problems with acne. She says she has started to see some clearing in her skin.</li>
    <li> I received this for a  discounted rate for an honest trial and review. So far I am really liking it and will continue to use it. It seems to really clean and tighten up your face and hopefully will make a dramatic improvement of the fine lines and wrinkles I currently have. Contains B3, and several different extracts that should help improve skin &amp;smells good and is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t feel gooey or sticky when done.</li>
    <li> This really made a difference on my skin - and I have sensitive skin that is middle aged breakout prone. I had discoloration and this really just made my face better overall - it really does surpass expectation.</li>
    <li> I love this product, It makes your skin feel very clear, improves your complexion and reduce blemishes.As any beauty product you have to use for few days before you start noticing any visible effect.It is a highly concentrated product so if you have a sensitive skin please do a sample test before using it on your whole face.It&#x27;s been several days but I am still forming my opinion about this product if something goes wrong I will update it in few days.The most funny part of this product is in the warnings section it is written that skin may look whiter and blemished may disappear after few days of use.I literally find it funny as they sounded like benefits to me rather then warning :)&lt;br /&gt;I got this product at promotional rate in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Smells good feels good and most importantly leaves your skin feeling good. I was given a discounted price to review this product. But would pay full price for it.</li>
    <li> This is a great face wash for my oily skin.  I use it to remove make-up and as part of my regimine to help my skin look younger.  It cleans great and unclogs my pores.  It removes all traces of oil and make-up, leaving my face smooth and soft. My skin feels like it does after a facial or a mask.  It is rare to find an anti-aging, anti-acne face wash. This is the best face wash I have found to prep my face for my anti-aging serums and moisturizer.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad or have any side effects on my sensitive skin.  I recommend this for all ages and genders to have clean, youthful skin.  *Disclaimer:  I received this product at a promotional DISCOUNT for testing and reviewing purposes.  My opinions expressed here are my own honest, unbiased viewpoints.</li>
    <li> Great texture on this face wash</li>
    <li> My son uses this for an Acne face wash and it works great.  It helps diminishes acne helps firm the skin. He also uses it as a shaving serum.  It isn&#x27;t too strong for his sensitive skin.  Works as good as expensive acne washes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of products online and over counter. Nothing, absolutely nothing comes close to this cleanser, it&#x27;s amazing for me. The only down side is it&#x27;s expensive but it&#x27;s so good I&#x27;d still give it a 5 star!</li>

    <li> Thanks soo much for allowing me to review this product. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this product and let me say it does work when using this product your skin might look a little whitish as it says on the box so just apply so face moisturizer and this should help take the whitish look away but my face look brighter and feels smooth also helping with my acne</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been 3 days and I already see my dark spots clear ...</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and I use Dermalogica face wash to help keep my acne controlled. I normally do not purchase anything other than Dermalogica because I have had horrible experiences and my face is very sensitive to most face wash products. I purchased Omiera Labs face wash product because of their 30 day warranty guarantee. I figured if I don&#x27;t not like it, I could return it. This item was purchased during a one time promotional code period and this review is written in my own words and experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wash smells very fresh and is a clear liquid texture. The wash has Vitamin B3 which helps skin look younger and more elastic. I have been using this face wash for about a week and my skin looks younger and has helped reduce blackheads and pores. The wash foams with water and I use the face wash everyday while I shower. My face is softer and I am very happy with this wash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is very elegant, but I have a hard time pouring the right amount of wash on my face. The wash does not come with a dispenser, a pump or a dropper. There is a small whole at the top which can make it hard to dispense the product. This is the only reason I have not given this facial wash a 5 star review, other than that the product works great and my skin has only had positive experiences. I look forward to seeing more results and purchasing more Omiera products in the future!</li>
    <li> I really have noticed that my skin is looking so much better after using this. I have VERY dry skin and this helps make my skin soft and smooth compared to any other facial wash I&#x27;ve ever tried. anything that helps my skin look better will always get 5 stars and make me a repeat customer!</li>
    <li> The packaging Omiera lab uses is very luxe and spa-like which would make this a nice gift. The solution is not like a traditional cleanser because it almost feels like a cleansing oil, but it washes away easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. The cleanser doesn&#x27;t create suds but it does remove makeup, even waterproof mascara, and clean deep into pores. My skin felt deep-down clean but not try at all! It was a truly hydrating wash as it says. I only needed to use a little bit to get s great clean and glowing skin. It&#x27;s a different cleanser experience and that&#x27;s a good thing! *discount given for unbiased opinion. I would recommend the product and order from the seller again.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice skin product that makes your skin feel really clean without feeling like it is drying out your skin. I do feel it has a tightening affect too.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny.  As someone who has struggled with acne and sun spots my whole life, ive pretty much tried everything.  Nothing worked for me until i tried this.  The Omiera Labs wash is amazing!  Within the first 4 days my face had pretty much cleared up completely, now i haven&#x27;t had any issues since i use it regularly.  Wish i knew about this back in high school when i was really struggling bad.  I do want to warn that if you have super sensitive skin not to use hot water with it, for some reason it made my feel like it was on fire, ever since used warm water and haven&#x27;t had any issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a reduced cost in exchange for my personal and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cleanser for about a week, and I actually saw positive results after only two uses. I was given a sample of this at a recent trade show and am happy I gave it a try. My skin has completely cleared up and is not irritated at all. As a 30 year old with sensitive skin prone to minor breakouts, it&#x27;s nice to find a gentle product with anti-aging &amp; acne-fighting benefits in one. Wonderful product that does what it says, quickly. I will definitely be repurchasing this.</li>
    <li> Guys how can I get this product at a cheaper price? In would like to give it a try but it&#x27;s too expensive.</li>
    <li> My skin has always given me problems when it comes to acne products, which are often way too harsh for those of us with sensitive skin. Not with this! My skin has been reacting positively to this face wash and I am seeing really promising results. The blackheads that I usually have on my nose are almost all gone and I hardly ever have breakouts on the rest of my face now. As an added bonus, this is great at removing make up, too.</li>
    <li> I received this Facial Cleaner for testing and reviewing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVE this facial cleanser! My face has felt so much cleaner since I started using this facial cleanser. I have hidradenitis(clogged sweat glands) and my skin can have major issues and the facial cleanser hasn&#x27;t had any side effects to my skin but has seemed to help my problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face feels super smooth after using this facial cleanser it actually feels like healthy skin. Not oily or dry but just how your skin is suppose to feel!&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of this facial cleanser as well. It&#x27;s not too strong for me. I also love that it&#x27;s organic! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a great new facial cleanser!</li>

    <li> This is an amazing face wash. Highly recommended. Leaves my skin feeling extremely soft and youthful. This bottle lasts me a month on average, washing day and night - only a little bit goes a long way. Wonderful and I have felt the difference in my skin within just days.

    <li> Didn’t do anything to me , my skin got even worse !</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a great face wash instead of a facial scrub like I&#x27;ve used for years. Well I was offered this Acdue Hydrating Wash for Acne and breakouts from Omiera Labs for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a bottle. It arrived and I was able to use it that evening when I showered. I put just a little on my konjac sponge and started rubbing it on my face using a circular motion. I rinsed it off and dried with my towel. My face feels and looks fantastic. I don&#x27;t even need to use a moisturizer my skin is so  soft. I definitely recommend this Acdue Hydrating Wash for Acne from Omiera Labs.</li>
    <li> If acne and wrinkles are your problem, then look no further. I love that this product fights acne and aging at the same time. I suffer from occasional adult acne and am at the age that I&#x27;m getting anxious about facial wrinkles. My face always feels really soft, clean, and hydrated after using this wash. I&#x27;m also noticing that I have had less frequent break outs since I&#x27;ve started using this. A really good product all around.</li>
