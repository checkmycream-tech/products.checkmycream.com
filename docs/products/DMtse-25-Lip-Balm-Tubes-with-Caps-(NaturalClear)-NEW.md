<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just what I needed for my homemade lip balm! Didn&#x27;t take as long for shipping as they said either.</li>
    <li> Poor quality ... The cheaper price should have been a give away - but u have it a shot anyway. I made lip balm and lets just say it leaked a bit when the stuff was liquid and hot. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> great deal and quick ship!!!</li>
    <li> Not only did these come a month after ordering, but all of them are dirty. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> These tubes operate exactly like the ones you purchase from big name companies that sell lip balm. I&#x27;m exploring creating my own products because it&#x27;s inexpensive, better for your body and fun to experiment with different ingredients to find what works well for you. These tubes were everything I hoped them to be. Definitely money spent well.</li>
    <li> Great buy for my first try at lip balm making. They worked out great! I would definitely buy them again.</li>
    <li> I bought these to fill up with homemade lip balm. They are sturdy and fill their purpose admirably. I used a medicine syringe to fill them, which works really well for small quantities as long as you keep your product hot.</li>
    <li> Great quality!  I like that the tubes are clear so I can see how much lip balm I have left.  I shopped around a lot, looking at many different websites that sell lip balm tubes and this was the best price I could find for clear tubes.</li>
    <li> These are such a good price and they were shipped much faster than expected. The tubes and lids are exactly as described.</li>
    <li> The caps were too big. I spent all day making lip balm and went to put caps on once they were cool &amp; none of them fit. A complete waste of my time, money &amp; ingredients!</li>
    <li> I needed these for my chap sticks I am making for gifts. I am sure they will work well.</li>
    <li> Great for DIY lip balm!!!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price! Shipping does however take a little longer than I had hoped, but definitely worth the wait.</li>
    <li> The tubes look fine although I haven&#x27;t put product into them as yet.</li>
    <li> This tube is functional, I didn&#x27;t have a problem with leaking at all (but I do use a good amount of bee&#x27;s wax), however the caps are so loose you can shake them off, or bump it and it&#x27;ll come off.  I wonder if they changed manufactures or something because the other reviewers said the lids are tight.  I like the clear tube, I just wished the lids would stay on.</li>
    <li> These chapstick tubes are def. cheaper than others I have bought but they are made from a lighter plastic and when I rolled them up and down a few times before I actually filled them, they stuck and had to be given a push to return to the down position.  Also, the little pad in the bottom fell out when rolled up, i was redoing and redoing trying to get my chapstick recipe the right consistency.</li>
    <li> Works very well for my chapstick, but some of the lids don&#x27;t seem to fit very well. Most are great though!</li>
    <li> They leak!!  I have purchased lip balm tubes before, but these are not the same. I have tried using these several times and my lip balm oozes out the bottom.</li>
    <li> Ordered two packages and need to order more already.  That&#x27;s what happens when you let your 9 yr old make chapstick for her entire class!</li>
    <li> Ordered these for homemade lip balm for Christmas presents. I will be ordering more in the future! No complaints about this product.</li>
    <li> I had to throw some away because they were leaking on the bottom when I put the wax in them</li>
    <li> The only thing about the tubes is that it takes a long time to come and the lid are a little loose not much  you should try it forget the bad reviews I&#x27;m a kid who just got up and started making chaptick</li>
    <li> I like the clear tube, it filled well, no leaks, caps fit snuggly. But the shipping is atrocious. I understand these are coming from China and will take a while to deliver. But these arrived a full TWO weeks after a similar order that I placed the same day (also for chap-stick tubes) from a different company in China.</li>
    <li> The caps are too loose after filling with lip balm ingredients.  This makes them unusable because the caps will easily come off if carried in pocket or purse.</li>
    <li> Product was as promised. Just what I was looking for and at a decent price. Needed them to make home made gifts for Christmas.. Shipping was real fast. I would definitely buy from you again and would recommend this seller to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I ordered 25 tubes but I only received 15 caps. I&#x27;m a little disappointed. I didn&#x27;t count everything out before I made my batch of lip balm and now I have a bunch of finished tubes that I can&#x27;t put a cap on.</li>
    <li> Came exactly as pictured. Nothing special, but great for homemade chapstick. Review requires I add more words, so I hope your recipe turns out well.</li>
    <li> I love these lip balm tubes. I make lip balm and it&#x27;s just perfect!</li>
    <li> I would give these five stars if they didn&#x27;t leak when they&#x27;re first filled. But they work for what I need to do….which is keep my lips moist in the winter. It seems they leak only a tiny bit and then stop, but it&#x27;s annoying to clean up. Great for homemade lip balm or perfume.</li>
    <li> As described. My only negative was that it appears I didn&#x27;t receive 25 caps for the 25 tubes. it might be that one got lost when I opened the package, as the caps were not attached to the tubes, but I looked everywhere and can&#x27;t find that 25th cap, so I have a lip balm that has no top. But quick ship &amp; items as described.</li>
    <li> took awhile since i didnt know where it was coming from. alot better then the other ones i bought thank you!</li>
    <li> So happy to find these at such an affordable price.  I&#x27;ve been making my own lipbalm since being diagnosed with various allergies.  I can make it for pennies and enjoy soft lips with no breakouts!</li>
    <li> After seeing mostly positive reviews, I thought it should be good.  I had purchased some before from another source on amazon and was very happy with them.  The caps on these tubes are so loose, I&#x27;m embarrassed to give them as gifts.  I&#x27;ve waited too close to Christmas to try and replace now.  Very frustrated and disappointed</li>
    <li> I read other reviews on this product so decided to give it a try.  These are the worst lipbalm tubes I have ever used.  I made my lip balm and poured in the tubes and set them on my counter.  I came back in to check on them about 15 minutes later and all of the lip balm had drained out onto my counter.  I lost a lot of supplies by trying to use the tubes.</li>
    <li> These tubes are perfect!  Best price I&#x27;ve found anywhere!  I can&#x27;t think of anything I don&#x27;t like about them. They did come from China, so shipping was a little slow.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the product. It works and I think it&#x27;s inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve made Chapstick and bug bite sticks with these and haven&#x27;t had any issues with leaking and the caps fit snug. Very happy with them so far. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> I made several lip balms this weekend and these worked perfectly!</li>
    <li> Good quality lip balm tubes for making home made lip balms. You can look other places and you will not find as good a value.</li>
    <li> Due to people complaining hat the lids didn&#x27;t stay on I tried them before I used them. Mine are okay and the price was great. They shipped pretty fast. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> tubes work great for making my own chapsticks.</li>
    <li> Great for my home-made chapstick! Love it I had no problems at all!</li>
    <li> Came as described and fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually not using these for lip balm. Let me explain a little. I cloth diaper my little one, and a lot of diaper rash ointments aren&#x27;t cloth diaper safe. A good alternative is coconut oil, plus it has so many other uses. Because I live in a cold area, my coconut oil doesn&#x27;t melt to an oil in the jar but remains solid. It&#x27;s harder to scoop out a fingerful of solid coconut oil instead of creamy or oily during every diaper change. Recently another cloth diapering mom told me she buys these tubes to fill with the melted coconut oil, and once they&#x27;re solid to use them on the little bums. GENIUS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the product. I bought these before reading the reviews. Even though there are many more positive reviews, the negatives had me a tad scared. I&#x27;ve gotten them, checked them all, and used 4. It was a fulfillment by amazon purchase, so I had them 10 days after ordering, and a week of that time it was with UPS. I wouldn&#x27;t doubt that they&#x27;re manufactured in China. I got the right amount of caps and tubes. All of them work. None mismatch. All of the caps fit snug. Of the 4 I filled, none leaked, although I accidentally overflowed the first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not know if they have BPA, which would be nice to know since I plan on using it for my baby. I do not know if they&#x27;re good quality for selling, but they seem just fine for personal use.</li>
    <li> I make many things and lip balm is one of them. these are easy to fill, clean and it shows my customers that not everything  i make is perfect. they are good with holding labels to.</li>
    <li> I used these to make my own lip balms.  They were perfect!  There were only 24 in a pack, but that is okay.</li>
    <li> These are pretty good lip balm tubes. I did not have any issues with leaking, and they are exactly as pictured. My only complaint is that the lids do not fit tightly. They are quite loose and many of them slip off. I probably won&#x27;t order them again because of this.</li>
    <li> used them to make lip balm. i was afraid there would be leakage but there hasnt been any. even when the lip balm melted in my car it didnt spill out of the package. the tops are a little loose but i havent had a problem with them yet.</li>
    <li> The girls made homemade lipstick with crayons and loved it!</li>
    <li> Not very high quality as the lids will not stay on with over half of them.</li>
    <li> Product did not meet my expectations !</li>
    <li> Love these tubes!  They are super cheap but are made of a strong, thick plastic, very durable for tossing them into a purse or backpack.  They feel and work just like store-bought chapstick tubes.  I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I got tired of spending $2-$3 per tube for Burt&#x27;s Bees and started making my own lip balm. These tubes work well and are a great value.</li>
    <li> 4 of the tubes initially didn&#x27;t work because the screw mechanisms were jammed.  It took quite a bit of force to break them free.  After that, all the tubes worked ok.  Other than that the manufacturing quality is acceptable, especially at this price.</li>
    <li> they are not the cheapes but they worked great</li>
    <li> Great shipping great products!!</li>
    <li> I like to make my own lip balm and these tubes work great! They operate fine and I would order them again.</li>
    <li> As soon as the tubes arrived, I put the caps on all of them because other people had mentioned that sometimes the caps were loose and fell off. They all fit and were nice and tight. I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but no one has complained that they leaked or didn&#x27;t function properly, so I am not concerned about that.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> They are very well sealed.  I poured the very hot melted lip balm in them, and it stayed in there nicely.</li>
    <li> I think these tubes Work great! I noticed no leaking. Missing one lid though. Otherwise it was a good value.Thank you!</li>
    <li> I decided to try to make my own lip balm.  I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;first timer&amp;#34; for that and so expected to mess it up some the first round or two.  Turned out to be easier than I expected.  These tubes worked out so well, I will be ordering more.  No leakage issues, no issues at all with them.</li>
    <li> I ordered my set from larkin supply: all the caps fit and snapped shut, they were a little hard to take the caps off. They arrived a few days earlier than estimated. I like them and definitely would recommend them.</li>
    <li> I got a couple of tubes that didn&#x27;t twist, so they&#x27;re useless. The rest worked fine and I was able to make lots of lip balm for gifts! Overall a good purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased these tubes and they work wonderfully. From my two orders I never experienced any missing tops. I make my own lip balm and these tubes will continue to be my tubes of choice.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait to fill these with homemade all natural chemical free lip balm! When filled these will make great gifts for family.</li>
    <li> After reading all the great reviews I ordered this product but unfortunately, I found  my shipment was the exact opposite. The caps to do not fit. Do not be fooled by the other reviews. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Not only does it not ship fast, but when if finally arrives you can&#x27;t even use the product.  I am left with useless tubes and have wasted my time, don&#x27;t be the next to do the same. Long wait, bad product, bad customer service &#x3D; NO, thank you!</li>
    <li> They work great but ebay is cheaper for this product.  just got it here because i had gift card but it is a great product and shipped fast!!!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews about leaking, so in an effort to prevent that from happening, I poured just a little into the bottom of each tube and let it harden up. Then I filled all the way up. Everyone loves the balm. I&#x27;ll be getting more tubes . . . and maybe a label maker too.</li>
    <li> Used these to put homemade lip balm in. They were perfect. The caps stayed on tight,&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again.</li>
    <li> When filled and in pocket the crank gets turned really easy. Some caps have crooked cuts. But other than that works great!</li>
    <li> These worked great for my homemade lip balm, and they worked just as well when I reused them the next time.</li>
    <li> Bought these to make lip balm, and half of the tubes had balm leak through the platform inside, making them unusable because you can&#x27;t twist the stick up. Mediocre.</li>
    <li> Great Item will buy again if need to!</li>
    <li> Purchased these from another vendor earlier this year, but bought these on my latest go-round. All the tops and bottoms were loose in the two bags that I received. When all were filled, I was two tops short. Frustrating and wasteful.</li>
    <li> These tubes worked out great.  My family loved the home made lip balms they got for Christmas.  wish they had them in bulk.</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t super sturdy or durable chapstick tubes.  They seem to mess up after being in my pocket for a while.  I recently got into making my own chapstick so I bought these.  They fulfill their purpose, but I want to find some that are good for reusing.</li>
    <li> This product is as advertised. I am unhappy with the company though. I ordered the first few days of May and it took until mid June to get it. Its my fault actually, as I did not see any notice that the product was being shipped from China. Had I known I would have chose another provider. I have no desire to deal with China ever again and have a personal policy to avoid all China made products. I will keep the tubes as it took FOREVER to get them and getting my money back would no doubt be a waste of time.</li>
    <li> This is not about the Seller. The seller is merely a broker. The manufacturer is at fault for the quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the cup in the bottom is very tall compared to the overall length of the tube. You will lose a lot of product there, so place something in the bottom. Maybe some melted bees wax. That way your actual lip balm or perfume balm will be fully utilized and not wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, out of the 25 I purchased, I had to throw away at least 5 because I couldn&#x27;t get them to twist. Even my husband couldn&#x27;t get them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy them again? I don&#x27;t know. The price is good. The seller was very fast in shipping -- WELL within the extremely long shipping time. It&#x27;s quite a toss up. I don&#x27;t like buying something when I know I likely won&#x27;t be able to use 20% of it.</li>
    <li> I was worried that these tubes would leak when I poured the warm chapstick mixture into them, but they sealed great at the bottom and the lids fit on securely too... so no wound up chapstick in your pocket. have already more a few more bags of these!</li>
    <li> Work well for what I needed them for. They are slightly larger in diameter than my other lip balm tubes and my shrink wrap bands did not fit them.</li>
    <li> This product is very cool.  It isn&#x27;t cheap looking and they are priced better than most of its kind online.  It was delivered on time and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I just started making my own lip gloss, and was frustrated with using little jars and using my finger.  I bought these to try making something more portable. They seem to be sturdy, and didn&#x27;t leak when I filled them.  However, now that the lip gloss has set, I am unable to roll it up.  So the lip gloss is just stuck in there.  I will try another one, but so far they don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> These tubes are easy to fill and are professional looking for my home made lip balm.  I need to order more of them!</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t say they are BPA free so I have to assume they are not. They&#x27;re great though, I made lipbalm with melted coconut oil, beeswax, honey and spearmint oil. Looks very professional and the caps stay on.</li>
    <li> These worked great for a lip gloss making day with my granddaughters.  They were easy to use and the girls loved that they made their own lip gloss.</li>
    <li> Perfect for homemade chapstick! The cap snaps on tightly and the roller worked great, no problems at all!</li>
    <li> Good quality for a great price. I will be able to reuse them as they empty. I make my own lip gloss, chapstick and lip balms. These are even leak proof. I made a batch of lip gloss and filled 3 of these with a warm liquid mixture and not a drop leaked out. The mix hardens as it cools. The tubes operate great. I am really glad I ordered a bag. They were on my wish list for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> First of all … AMAZON NEEDS to start requiring sellers to list the country where the item is shipping from. It should be very clear, very easy to access. I am going to take responsibility for my own part in this and start reviewing each company info, but I think that is something that should be clearly marked. I have knowingly purchased from other countries, but as far as this, well … I would have rather purchased these from the US as I will be using them for lip balm.Also, I have all the ingredients and now I have to wait on these, and they take FOREVER! It has been weeks now and the estimate is still looking at mid Feb-early March. Really? PLus, now I will have to sterilize them, and I hope they can take that. Ugh! I think it&#x27;s awful that it is not clearly marked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUYER BEWARE!</li>
    <li> Will definitely buy more of these tubes.  Great little containers.  The twist at the bottom works perfectly and I really liked the pureness of the clear tube.</li>
    <li> Worked perfect perfectly for my homemade chapstick. My family was excited to use this product. It came from Japan, so it took awhile, but still came ahead of schedule.</li>
    <li> Item was priced right and was exactly as described.  This was a great buy and I look forward to making lip balm!</li>
    <li> Got these way faster than I thought. All the tops fit!! They don&#x27;t leak and is a great product. Will definitely be ordering from them again.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the lids don&#x27;t really stay on.  They just slip on and off without that little &amp;#34;snap&amp;#34; that makes them stay on.  They&#x27;re fine for leaving all over the house but don&#x27;t put them in your purse and think it wont get all over.</li>
    <li> This was on a gift registry. Said it was in stock and would ship immediately.  Took 4 weeks to get. It came directly from China. Opened the dirty plastic shipping bag and they all fell on the floor. Now I have to find something to put them in for the gift. There was no paperwork.  I&#x27;m wondering how safe the plastic is.</li>
    <li> As this was my first attempt I wasn&#x27;t sure what was best.  The others I looked at were going to come from overseas &amp; take 2 weeks to get to me.  i got these in time to make chapstick for Christmas.  They were perfect.  I look forward to purchasing again!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> These are great little lip balm tubes.  They are high quality and clear.  They came quickly in a nice size package that I am using to store them in.  I make my own lip balm, so these are great. They are a great value, as well.</li>
    <li> Great for gift giving of homemade lip balm for those of us that are sensitive to certain ingredients (mine is fragrance!) I love knowing exactly what I put into my lip balm, and I also cut one down at the bottom and filled up my existing Sugar Advanced Therapy lip balm tubes so I can have something very sturdy when traveling.</li>
    <li> my teenager is the ultimate D-I-Y-er!!  loves to make balms, lotions, glosses... all that stuff!  i bought her these for a surprise gift, and she was overjoyed - made 3 different lip balms that night and she loves them!  great quality; they don&#x27;t leak, nice &amp; solid, and it&#x27;s awesome that you can see exactly what color the balm is b/c the tubes are clear! *genius*</li>
    <li> caps don&#x27;t stay on well</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, and these work very well for my home made lip balm products. They are easy to fill and look like they may be able to be reused at least one time (for my personal use of course). They look to be similar quality to commercial products. I like that they are semi clear so that you can see how much product is left. I just wish that there was a package deal with tubes and shrink wraps together at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product. It&#x27;s working well for me.</li>
    <li> These worked well for my homemade lip balm. My only issue was price. For some reason you can find white tubes much cheaper.</li>
    <li> I bought these to make my own lip balm and they work great.  They are just as they appear and I had no trouble with them.  I will order more of these when I run out.</li>
    <li> I use these for homemade lip chap and they work perfectly. I fill them using a glass dropper. They hold up well being stored in the fridge then carried around in a purse in Florida while being used.</li>
    <li> Product was ok for the price. Several of the tubes were missing caps, so they were useless. The little pieces on the inside of the tube that slides up and down to extend and retract the lip balm, only go about 3/4ths of the way down, so when filling, you have a bit of wasted empty space. Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Product does the job. I made homemade chap stick and they worked perfectly up to this time. No defects from the ones I made. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Worked great for my homemade Chapstick. I was a little worried the plastic would be too flimsy for the heat, but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Used these to make my own lip balm.</li>
    <li> So so.  Some leaked, and others were warped.</li>
    <li> I received the product a couple of months ago and I really like it. It&#x27;s 25 plastic lip balm tubes and work well with homemade lip balm.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  There is a natural lip balm I really like but it comes in those annoying little jars, so I used these tubes to transfer that balm into.  So far they are working great.  Caps are staying on, been using them for about 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> arrived on time, and they are what they say.  perfect for making home made lipbalm.  a quick rinse with alcohol, and they were ready to fill.</li>
    <li> Some lids loose and don&#x27;t stay on.</li>
    <li> I reordered these because the first ones were perfect. Disappointed in the second order...totally different size than the first. Now I have a lip balm filler tray that I can&#x27;t even use!</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my homemade lip balms and they were exactly as I expected them to be.  They are your typical lip balm containers with the little spin at the bottom.  They&#x27;ve held up well.</li>
    <li> The only reason I give 3 stars is because of the caps. They don&#x27;t give much confidence that it will stay on while bouncing around in your purse/pocket. Otherwise they are true to description and work wonderfully.</li>
    <li> The caps I received do not match the tubes that came with them...they fall right off. No way I can give lip balm as gifts when they will rub all over my friend&#x27;s pockets and purses! Submitted a claim for a refund, wish me luck! Edited 12/20: The seller sent me new caps, which fit just fine. Rating changed from 1 to 4 stars. Someone in the warehouse is mismatching their products? Sad, because apparently it&#x27;s causing a bunch of negative reviews.</li>
    <li> Price is very good, and they hold the lip balm I make for gifts. I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> These guys work well and have a nice capacity.  Just like a chapstick tube you&#x27;d find in the store.  The only downside is unavoidable - the long shipping time from the manufacturer...  otherwise, fully satisfied.  I&#x27;ve ordered them 3 times now.</li>
    <li> Received the clear lip balm tubes, have used for 6 so far. Have no problems, don&#x27;t leak, all have worked well so far. Very nice appearance, would buy again, no complaints!</li>
    <li> great quality. super fast delivery.</li>
    <li> This product has a tightly fitting cap, didn&#x27;t leak when I poured hot melted lip balm into it, and dispenses easily. It was just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I read other reviews that said the caps were loose, I don&#x27;t have that problem. Glad I took a chance on them.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I ordered and with the Prime account, I got it in just a couple of days.  Plenty of time to fill with home made lip balm and send out for the holidays.</li>
    <li> I received my order and I&#x27;m glad to have it before Xmas, now I can make the lip balm to my family and myself thanks</li>
    <li> these are perfect for making my own lipgloss and a  good deal too. i would purchase again and probably will.</li>
    <li> I made my own lip balm and bought these containers because the price was right. They work perfect. There are no leaks when putting the melted balm into the tube (using an eye dropper), and the lids fit well. When I need tubes I would purchase these again.</li>
    <li> The chap stick I added leaked into the bottom of the tube - this left gaps when the chap stick cooled.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected them to be!</li>
    <li> Nice used them already!!</li>
    <li> Great product, great price! Came sooner than expected and work well. Will be buying more, love that they are BPA free.</li>
    <li> I make my own lip balm with these and they work well for that purpose.  I would buy again when I need more</li>
    <li> The label doesn&#x27;t state that it is therapeutic grade, which I much prefer.  The extraction process can modify the molecular structure and therapeutic benefit, so I was sorry to see the product was not certified or even labeled as therapeutic.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the lip balm tubes. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> They are perfect for the homemade Chapstick I make and look better than the pictures!</li>
    <li> very cheap for 25tubes. Work well</li>
    <li> Was so excited to get these and use them,but sadly, the product leaked right out of the bottom. :/  Hopefully others have better results!</li>
    <li> More than half of these leaked.</li>
    <li> Product met my expectations. Have had zero issues. They even came sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> I specifically looked for an item that wasn&#x27;t too expensive but also one that WASNT coming from China. Being that I bought balm tubes for organic homemade lip balm, I am really upset to be using these potentially BPA-tainted plastic from a sweatshop in China on my lips. Lame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only realized this AFTER I placed my order and came on here to check the status of shipping… noticed it was going to take the max amount of time (ordered on Jan 3rd, received on February 7th)…and then and ONLY THEN did I see the note about it being shipped from China. So pissed. I want a refund.</li>
    <li> So disappointed.  I ordered Lip Balm tubes from 2 different sellers here on Amazon and they were both the exact same thing. Barely any of the caps fit any of the tubes.  If they &amp;#34;fit&amp;#34; on without immediately sliding off, they wobbled on the top and would most definitely come off in a bag or purse.  Out of the total of 75 that I ordered (this listing and the other), 11 of them had snug fitting caps that snapped on nicely.  I will be ordering elsewhere next time.</li>
    <li> These look like they will work, the bottom turns easly - my grand-daugter and I are making lip balm, I think these&lt;br /&gt;will work perfect. Thank you</li>
    <li> So my lip balm tubes arrived and I was super happy until I opened up the package and found clear tubes with white caps, I&#x27;m sure I will find a use for them at some point, but they are not what I ordered, and that was CLEAR tubes with CLEAR caps.</li>
    <li> The caps don&#x27;t fit and it would cost as much to return them as to buy something else. Don&#x27;t waste your time. The seller is not inspecting his product.</li>
    <li> These work very well for my homemade lip balm.  They are easy to use, and I really like that I can see through the clear container so I can see how much is left.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t keep track ofhow long it took to be deliverd.  4 tubes on 25 were not working properly. I will never order them again. That&#x27;s it!</li>
    <li> I made lipstick for my female family members this Christmas.  It was a little embarrassing passing out the tubes as the lids didn&#x27;t stay on well.  I would have bought new tubes if I had not made it the day before the party and had no time to order new ones.&lt;br /&gt;The lids stayed on well enough (generally) that you could hold it upside down without it falling off, but if you apply the slightest pressure they pop off.&lt;br /&gt;On the up side, these tubes did not leak out the bottom.  For home use only they might be fine but definitely not for the bottom of a purse!</li>
    <li> Perfect and practical for home made lipbalm from beeswax.  Wish I had ordered more right away.  They worked out great!  And they came quickly in the mail.</li>
    <li> The caps snap on tight. I didn&#x27;t really want clear tubes, but they actually made my homemade lip balm look great. Best value after all my research.</li>
    <li> I use this lip balm tube for the fun activity of K9 Fun Nose Work.  It&#x27;s a great tool to hide the q-tip with odor.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Elegant?&amp;#34; you say, &amp;#34;Really?&amp;#34; Yes. I bought these tubes and some other tubes with white lids. I realized that these tubes look better because the lid is also clear. A small detail, but makes all the difference. Also, they&#x27;re good quality and the mechanism works. I&#x27;ve already made lip balm and used it myself. They work great. No issues. :)</li>
    <li> Great construction, durable, I have even refilled my personal lip balm tube after I boil it in water to get any residue off and it still works great. Will purchase again</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for. Good quality. The caps snap on and STAY on. The stopper at the bottom is sealed so no product leaked out under it.&lt;br /&gt;And the price was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I make and sell my own lip balm and I really like these tubes a lot because I like to color my lip balm different colors and they look so nice in these natural tubes. I plan on purchasing these in the future.</li>
    <li> I needed this and now i can produce my own creations because of Amazon anything container or natural ingredient i can find right here....No problem.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price.  The plastic is a little thin but it works great.</li>
    <li> Not impressed.  Liked the price, and when I received the product it looked great.  Used the product and the caps DID NOT fit. My lip balms were useless..</li>
    <li> This product is satisfactory. Clear plastic lip-balm tubes for home-made lip balms. They all worked as expected and looked great. Some of the caps had small cracks in the top, but it didn&#x27;t affect the way they fit and so wasn&#x27;t a problem for my project.</li>
    <li> Worked very well with my products it put in it. will purchase again. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I tried these out to make my homemade chapstick.  Worked great and caps were snug.  I would buy these again.</li>
    <li> I love being able the purchase these empty tubes.  I prefer making my lip balm and these tubes has made that possible, because I do not have to worry about what I am going to put the lip balm in.</li>
    <li> So, it turns out I should have ordered twice as many.  I LOVE these and will definitely be ordering more.  They were quite easy to fill and were delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> these work great! no leaks and the bottom turns well moving the balm easily higher. I would buy again</li>
    <li> These are great. I was a little worries about getting them because of so many bad reviews but I had to try BC the price was unbelievably affordable. They are wonderful and work well for me. The caps snap on and off with no problems. When filling the tubes, none of them leaked. Prefect for my homemade lip balm &amp; make great gifts too!</li>
    <li> I ordered these as I found an extremely easy recipe for making your own lip balm and was eager to try it out. The tubes I&#x27;ve used so far have held up beautifully. I carry a tube around in my purse all the time and haven&#x27;t had an issue at all. Neither have the few people I&#x27;ve given the lip balm to complained about any defects in the containers. Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for, and I&#x27;m ready to order more! I would recommend these for anyone that makes homemade lip balms.</li>
    <li> Worked out really well for my lip balm.</li>
    <li> Perfect for homemade lip balm (olive oil, coconut oil, beeswax).  Fasten several together with rubber bands so they stand upright, and make a tiny funnel out of foil to fill from a small, old-fashioned tin coffee pot. Toss the foil funnel; keep the coffee pot for next time.</li>
    <li> We ordered them to make homemade lip balm!!!  They worked perfectly for that!!  It wasn&#x27;t an easy project but worthwhile.  Do it with a smaller number of kids would probably be better.</li>
    <li> I just got my lip balm tubes.  Great price AND no shipping??!! I know, amazing.  The only reason I gave it four stars was because it did take a little bit of time for them to get from me.  However, they shipped from China, so that is to be expected.</li>
    <li> They work great.  No leaks, the product turns up well when dialed, lids all fit.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Shipped within expected time! Great!</li>
    <li> Bought for simple Christmas presents. Exactly what i wanted and it arrived on time. Will definitely buy again for future projects</li>
    <li> Have used 10 for my home made lip balm.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This product is just as pictured and described. My order was delivered weeks before expected delivery date, which is a plus.  The tubes are just a tiny bit less rigid than would be ideal. But they certainly hold up and perform as needed.</li>
    <li> Caps come off way to easy.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re basically exactly what you&#x27;d expect! These are excellent for making your own all-natural lip balm. I poured a hot beeswax and coconut oil concoction into them and they held up fine.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted as making your own lip balm is so much better for you and works better too.</li>
