<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does a great job! Easy application.  Long lasting🌟</li>
    <li> Loved the product and got the effect promised but I think it seemed expensive for what you got.  Replaced with a different brand recently but have not trie dit yet.</li>
    <li> This works well, colors brows- not sure it lasts for endless weeks, I&#x27;d say 3-4 weeks maybe but it does a lovely job of tinting your brows and fills them in nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW- listen up- do not be fooled into thinking two minutes isn&#x27;t long enough unless you aspire to resemble an angry Sesame Street character. Also, go THIN when putting it on because if you go wide, your brows will dye wider. I recommend a think eyeliner brush instead of the wood tool they give you unless you&#x27;ve got great control over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great overall though, works better than regular hair dye AND has lots of product, I imagine this kit will last a year.</li>
    <li> The eyebrow dye is easy to use and 3 weeks later is still covering gray. I was worried when my eyebrows turned really dark brown for the first few days and I looked like a cross between Joan Crawford and Groucho Marx!  Then the color evened out. I will use the product again.</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this product after noticing gray hairs in my eyebrows a few months after having them done professionally. I wanted to give it a try so I wouldn&#x27;t have to go to the salon all the time, and after reading other positive reviews. My hair is gray-platinum blonde, skin is fair, and eyes are blue. I was very careful on the first try, just leaving the product on for 15 seconds and then wiping/rinsing it off. I then did another application, leaving it on for an additional 15 seconds. Before it was over with, I went a full 2 minutes. As others mentioned, I did this on a Friday so everything would look okay on Monday. My results were brows with a sexy, darker look, and it covered all the gray. Also, I didn&#x27;t have the Graucho Marx look, and the color was \\&quot;just right.\\&quot; Within two days, the brows were perfect. It&#x27;s been a month now, and they still look just great! One of the best things about this product is you get to control how long you leave it on, more or less to suit your desired look. It&#x27;s long-lasting, and you&#x27;ll have plenty of product left for later applications. I will definitely purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> This IS NOT light brown at all. The result was super dark and the way to mix the ingredients is retarded. I had to use BLONDE dye after it just so get a brown color. Useless.</li>
    <li> This stuff really is incredible! Based on other reviews I ordered the light brown even though I have medium/ dark mahogany hair, SO glad I did. With two mins processing time my eyebrows are darker than my hair!!! If your hair is light, I would strongly recommend either using a diff product, or doing one eye at a time so that the solution is only on for a minute or less. Otherwise, this product is awesome - darkened all the little blonde hairs instantly!</li>
    <li> This item is extremely hard to use..........and it doesn&#x27;t stay on but a few days.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Left my eyebrows looking jet blacK!!!! Even though I had it on for 30 seconds! Not light brown at all! Waste of money!</li>
    <li> I got the light brown and it was definitely light black the first day, but faded to a nice brown shortly. It might be a good idea to start timing when you start applying rather than when you finish.  It&#x27;s been a week and seems to be holding up. I used a Qtip with most of the cotton removed, just enough left to hold the dye and disperse it onto the brows.  I would have used a masara wand but they all have metal and Godefroy states no metal to be used.  I only got a little on my skin and it came off with windex on a paper towel.  Might try the 28 day mascara</li>
    <li> this product worked really well, but if i were to leave it on for the recommended amount of time, i&#x27;d probably look like Mr. Ed. I have fairly blonde hair, and leaving it on my brows for about 30 seconds was just about perfect (if not a little too much) unlike the minute to two minutes the directions say.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  I did not find this too dark as some other reviewers did.  Covered my gray eyebrows well!</li>
    <li> This product worked great BUT my eyebrow did NOT turn out light brown, but more like light black.  I&#x27;m a natural redhead and my eyebrows are light brown/reddish with some gray.  I left the product on for less than a minute and it definitely darkened up my brows but to a black hue, not even close to brown.  I will now have to work on bleaching them!</li>
    <li> I found this product to be somewhat messy to start with. When the developer is combined with the color it turns out very thick when applied. It also makes much more than needed. I would prefer tubes like you get with men&#x27;s mustache &amp; beard tint.  Make only what you need; as much as you want or as little as you want and it has many more applications.  I&#x27;ve been using men&#x27;s mustache &amp; beard tint for my eyebrows for several years now.  I will stick with that as it is easier to use and more cost effective.</li>
    <li> i have been dying my hair blond for years and have almost non existent eyebrows, so when i discovered this product, i was very excited.  it does a great job dying my eyebrows, however even the \\&quot;light brown\\&quot; color is pretty dark no matter how short of time i dye them.  i usually look a bit silly for a day or two until the product settles in so i plan my dye jobs accordingly (over the weekend and not right before i leave the house).</li>
    <li> ...she ain&#x27;t what she used to be...but close...not the right color for me but easy enough to do myself to look the way I used to...many long years ago.</li>
    <li> I love the convenience and ease of this product, but I must warn any of you out there with fair hair...  My eyebrows are naturally VERY blonde (I like to refer to the color as clear!), and even though I used the lightest shade possible and left it on for only 30 seconds I still ended up with near black eyebrows!  Fortunately my husband thinks they&#x27;re sexy, so it&#x27;s all good in the end.  I like the ease of mixing and the quick application, wait and wash time.  I just wish there were a way to really stop the color process and leave my brows only slightly darker than their natural shade.  Good luck all!</li>
    <li> The reviews on this product are very helpful.  I used a old narrow mascara wand which I had cleaned, 2 Q-tips and a little olive oil in a small, small dish.  I used half of a capsule of dye and mixed up the dye. Then I applied the oil around my brow with a Q-Tip.  I applied the dye to the mascara wand very thinly and then brushed the dye on my brows. I took the clean end of the Q-Tip I had used to apply the oil and wiped off any dye that had gotten on my skin (very gently).  I had a wet towel handy and after 30 seconds I wiped off the dye.  My brows needed more color so I dyed them a second time.  The color was just right and I had no color on my skin.  The color is a darker brown, so I highly suggest that you wipe the dye off after 20 or 30 seconds the first time to make sure it is not too dark for you.  I had plenty of dye left over so I don&#x27;t think you need to use a whole capsule of dye unless you have a lot of brow to dye (my brows are thin).  Anyway, be patient, don&#x27;t skip any steps and you will be pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I had used this product several years ago and loved it then was unable to find it again.  Now it&#x27;s back and I am very happy.  I have very light, sparse eyebrows with some gray hair as well.  I use this product and it darkens them to my very light brown hair color and does cover the gray.  I would say that it doesn&#x27;t last for 6 weeks but it doesn&#x27;t take long to dye them, so it&#x27;s no big deal.  If you are looking for a lighter shade, I would suggest only leaving it on for about 30-45 seconds.  The first time I looked like Groucho Marx. And I hadn&#x27;t protected my surrounding skin so it was everywhere. It will dye your skin and it does last for a day or two.  So make sure that you use something on the surrounding skin to protect it.  I apply a thin layer of mineral oil with a Q-tip (baby oil is exactly the same, it just has fragrance added) and I use a small, stiff angled makeup brush to apply it.  I don&#x27;t care for the wooden applicators they give you.  If it is too light, you can always do it again.  And the amount of dye in the capsules can be divided up and you don&#x27;t have to use a whole capsule at a time.  I get at least twice as many applications this way.  But like I said, my eyebrows are thin and sparse so you will have to evaluate it for yourself.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  I have sensitive skin and I have no reaction to the dye.  Just be very careful that you do not mix it too thin and it drips. The last thing you want is dye dripping in your eye.  That&#x27;s why I prefer the brush over the stick.  You can control it much easier.</li>
    <li> I have tried a couple of other brands but they were messy and did not cover the grey.  I used an old mascara wand to apply the color. This was suggested by a previous poster and it worked great. Also using 1/2 the capsule is perfect. The light brown is plenty dark enough.</li>
    <li> For all the same reasons I liked the Eyelash tint, I like this product. Nice to have eyebrows that can be seen, and it&#x27;s very natural and not too dark. Easily applied...looks great!</li>
    <li> I have lighter eyebrows and this darkens them more realistic i think than any color eye brow pencil i&#x27;ve used.  Be careful when applying not to go outside the eyebrow lines too much because it is hard to get off your skin.  It normally lasts at least 2 months, it just fades gradually and when it gets really light i just reapply again.  The capsules it comes in can be cut in half, i found using the entire one was too much waste so i actually get 2x the amount of applications from one box.</li>
    <li> I use this to do my eyebrows every three weeks. It says it lasts a lot longer, but it doesn&#x27;t on me. It can be tricky to use and I recommend putting a thin layer of Vaseline on surrounding skin to keep from getting stained. Just use a steady hand and lots of patience. I leave mine on a few minutes longer than it says to get the color I want. Compared to $30 a time at the spa, this is a HUGE bargain!</li>
    <li> Just finished using this product about an hour ago. I think I kept it on 1 minute or two longer then directions, so it is a little darker then I wanted but I LOVE IT,I am amazed how great it worked. I have been using hair color but it stopped working on the gray  and washed out within days so I starting using a pencil and it takes an extra 5 to 10 minutes every morning to make them look somewhat natural.I hope this lasts as long as the box says &amp; even if it only lasts half as long I&#x27;ll be happy. I also saved 1/2 the cost of buying this product at the discount beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> Although the color advertised was Light Brown, the actual tint turned eyebrows dark brown.  It was easy to use and I will cut processing by 50% next time.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews. I was desperate to find an affordable way to dye my white/blonde eyebrows, for which I had been paying $40 at the salon, not to mention the time I spent in the chair. This product is amazing! It&#x27;s super easy and quick and worked as promised. This is saving me a ton of money and time, and I get to control exactly how dark my brows get. Love it!</li>
    <li> Because I have no thyroid, I have sparse thin eyebrows that have a ton of grey in them.  I have used powder and pencil but never looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit worried because my brows are so thin, but now that I have dyed them, I see I have more eyebrow than I thought.  They look great!&lt;br /&gt;I used the light brown and left it in for 1 1/2 mins, next time I think I will only leave for 1 min.  They are not really dark, just a bit darker than I am used to because of all the grey hairs.  Over all I am THRILLED!&lt;br /&gt;I also only used 1/2 capsule instead of a full one and had more than enough to finish both brows.&lt;br /&gt;As for how long it will last, that remembers to be seen as I only did it a day ago.&lt;br /&gt;I had no trouble with staining on the skin, used the Vaseline under the brow as recommended but not even sure I would have needed it.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the brow brush for application and it went on so easily.</li>
    <li> well lets start with the fact that if you have really light eye brows like myself dont follow the directions and keep this product in for one to two minutes. try it for 30seconds to 45 seconds. this \\&quot;light brown\\&quot; product turned my eye brows BLACK. yes after 2 weeks it lightened up a little and they are finally like 4 weeks in they were basically color they should be. the color on the box is no wheres near the color your eye brows will be. i will try my second capsule soon and see if this one will look better if i leave it in for only 30 seconds if im not satisfied im throwing it away i never want my eye brows to be black ever again</li>
    <li> The tint doesn&#x27;t really last 6 weeks, but that&#x27;s OK -- it still lasts longer than the salon tints.  The price is also very reasonable -- I only need 1/2 capsule per application.  I definitely would recommend this product.  One caveat -- the light brown color actually comes out pretty dark on my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I like this product, it&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t stain the skin to bad. Last a good amount of time, and it&#x27;s convenient if i decide i need a tint I just do it, no waiting for an apt.</li>
    <li> This is really easy to use, very fast- I only left on for 30 seconds, as my hair is light brown, and it was perfect.  It does not take much- I think I could make one package last for a year!</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t bad, but it&#x27;s NOT for dyed blondes. I tried to using it and it turned my eyebrows almost black! It looked like I took a black crayola marker and tried to use it as a makeup. It faded a little, but I still needed bleach cream to repair it. I have to wax my eyebrows regularly since they tend to be bushy otherwise, I like how it helps fill the eyebrow shape more. To help improve my eyebrows look I usually have to use eyeliner pencil. My eyebrows looked MUCH better when I left my eyebrow color as it was before using this. Thankfully Amazon was kind enough to refund me after having the horrid mess of nearly black eyebrows. If you REALLY want to lighten your eyebrows to match your hair, go for some bleach cream.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews here I decided to give this a try. I&#x27;ve got medium brown hair with blondish highlights and read here that although the box says \\&quot;light brown\\&quot;, if you leave it on longer it will make your brows darker than light brown. I&#x27;ve been trying to grow my eyebrows back in for the past 6 weeks using \\&quot;LiBrow\\&quot; (which IS working BTW) after having been almost browless for many years. (Overplucking in the early 80&#x27;s....NEVER AGAIN!!) I didn&#x27;t think that I&#x27;d EVER have natural eyebrows again, but thanks to the \\&quot;LiBrow\\&quot; and this product, I DO!! As my brows are growing out, I&#x27;m using this to darken up the brand new sort of baby fine hairs that are growing where I&#x27;ve had none for almost 30 years. It makes them way more visible and thicker and they look more natural and almost match the rest of my brows that have grown back thicker. I&#x27;m hoping that they&#x27;ll all look the same some day soon. It&#x27;s very easy to apply (I also use a fine blending eye makeup brush that was very cheaply bought at CVS), and keep a couple of q-tips handy to wipe away any excess that may get on the skin above or below the eyebrow hairs. I leave it on for 1-1 1/2 minutes and that does the trick. Each capsule has MANY applications to it. The box comes with 4 capsules, but trust me, you only need a little bit of the powder from the capsule and a few drops of the activator to \\&quot;do\\&quot; your eyebrows. So this box will last a long time in my opinion. I&#x27;ve already applied it twice a week for 3 weeks now and still have some left in the 1st capsule. I&#x27;ve also used it twice on my husband&#x27;s greying eyebrows (at HIS request) and although I had to leave it on longer, it worked for his too. He was satisfied with it and will probably want me to \\&quot;do his eyebrows\\&quot; weekly now....lol. I&#x27;ll buy it again here when I start getting low. The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I&#x27;m having to apply it twice a week. I really think that it&#x27;s because I thoroughly wash my eyebrows twice a day with a cleanser though before applying the \\&quot;LiBrow\\&quot;. I&#x27;ll know when I am able to quit using it. Otherwise, a GREAT product!!fore applying the \\&quot;LiBrow\\&quot;. I&#x27;ll know when I am able to quit using it. Otherwise, a GREAT product!!</li>
    <li> It works, and if you scrub the area afterwards you can get most of the stain out. highly recomended. I have blonde eye brows and this product is just what I was looking for. I think its good that it washes out in about 45 days because you can&#x27;t make a huge mistake. If you are fair skinned, do not use the medium brown of you will be graucho marx for a few days!</li>
    <li> This product is great!  It is simple to use and my eyebrows look very professional.  I have been using Rapid Lash and it grew my eyebrows back and now with this dye they look wonderful!</li>
    <li> easy to apply, great results, natural look!! i love this product!!! definitely worth the price as compared to going to a salon where you get charged 50 bucks.</li>
    <li> I WISH THERE IS 0 STARS FOR THIS PRODUCT, 1 STAR IS WAY TOO MUCH!!! Product is described as LIGHT BROWN, well all you get is DARK - BLACK color!!! I wanted to lighten up my brows because my hair color is lighter now - well this made my brows even DARKER!!! So upset with this product and even worse...so upset with the way my brows look now! Godefroy I will NEVER buy your product ever again, not this one, not any other product you make!!! Shame on you and try to be at least responsible with the way you describe and sell your product! And YES, FEEL FREE TO GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK!!! THANKS!!!!</li>
    <li> I had to leave this on longer than the directions said to get the desired light brown color. But it does work. I don&#x27;t know how long it will last but the color is realistic, an ashy brown. I used an angled eyeshadow brush to apply rather than the wood stick and only used 1/2 a capsule, which was plenty.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product many times and am very happy with it. I generally will ptu it on my brows a couple of minutes before I go into the shower. It is quick and relatively easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbara Kent [[ASIN:0982347103 Success in the Words of the Masters]]</li>
    <li> I love this brow tint! But beware... light brown is NOT light brown.  I have dark brows and this shade works perfectly for me. It covers those pesky white brow hairs that drive me crazy. You can leave this on dark brows for a minute or two without getting &amp;#34;Groucho&amp;#34; brows. I would suggest this shard for everyone. If you truly have light brows, I don&#x27;t think I would use this.</li>
    <li> I love this product. works very well with light eyebrows. the color is very dark for maybe a day or two then fades into the perfect light brown color. I&#x27;ve bought 2 of these already! I will def buy more also</li>
    <li> I found this product to be easy to use and very quick. It lasted for a little over a month, so I&#x27;m happy with the product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I think this product is great doesn&#x27;t stain the skin to much ,it is fast and results are awesome . I bought a dark brown color i am a blonde so this suits my needs .</li>
    <li> So I ordered the light brown and then read some of the reviews and was worried it was going to turn out too dark... I&#x27;m very fair and eyebrows platinum blonde. It turned out great!!! They did not get too dark at all... I&#x27;m so pleased . And it was extremely easy to do. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s very easy to use and apply. It also costs much less then going to a professional salon. Great product and great value</li>
    <li> Very easy to use.  I used the tint for 30 sec. at first, then  increased 30 sec. the 2nd time.  Didn&#x27;t want too dark as I had no real color in my brows.  It seemed a little dark, even though I used the light brown, but that was only because I wasn&#x27;t used to seeing any color at all.  Will likely need to redo after 1 month.  Very good product overall.</li>
    <li> I have invisible blonde eyebrows so am always looking for ways to make them dark enough to see and define my face without being too dark and making me look weird. I&#x27;ve done the salon thing at $30 a pop many times but now that I have this product, never again! It was super easy to apply and just took me about 15 min for the whole process, beginning to end. Beats the heck out of driving to the salon, waiting for the appt., getting tinted, and paying $30 + tip!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in light brown. I have medium red hair, (darker than strawberry blonde, and not quite auburn), but I have very blonde eyebrows/eyelashes. I have been using a wax and powder color combo to darken up my eyebrows for the past  several years, which I loved. I hated however that I would wake up, \\&quot;without my eyebrows on!\\&quot; and I hated having to apply it everyday! When I got this product I instantly tried it out! I gotta say, I loved it! It took me about 3 applications (using only half of a capsule of product total!) to get the shade I was looking for. VERY EASY TO APPLY! foolproof! I used vaseline around my brows to prevent staining. The dye didnt stain my skin at all! The results are very natural, however, redheads, I recommend Light Brown. There is no red pigments mixed into the brown color (more of a black based brown as opposed to a red based brown) so, apply lightly the first few times until you get the hang of it so your brows dont scream BROWN and clash against your red hair!   I love that I dont have to use my wax and powder anymore! LOVEEEE this! I recommend this product to anyone self conscious or annoyed by their blonde eyebrows!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Light Brown on my naturally dark brown eyebrows. It turned their color to dark black!!!????, I don&#x27;t know what should I do now? This color looks really terrible on me. I had seen the same results for this brand and exactly on this color before in the reviews, but I didn&#x27;t believe that. I wish I have never bought this product :(</li>
    <li> So un-impressed!! This stuff gave me black-charcoal colored eyebrows within 20 seconds! The package says \\&quot;light brown\\&quot; with a picture of the color brows I wanted.  I am so angry and the stupid phone number on the box goes to a voicemail.  NEVER will i buy this crap again.  I am disgusted with the way I look now. &gt;:/</li>
    <li> like i said, this product really sucks.&lt;br /&gt;i have black eyebrow so i ordered light brown to match my light colored hair.&lt;br /&gt;i followed the instruction well.&lt;br /&gt;But after i tried this product on my eyebrows, it darkened them, turned to more more black and even dyed on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want my money back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have never had my eyebrows dyed at a salon, so I can&#x27;t comment on the comparison between this product and salon results.  All in all, it words pretty well.  The application process is awkward using the stick provided.  A small brush would probably work better.  I didn&#x27;t have one handy after mixing the product, but will try a brush next time.</li>
    <li> Great product, do it on a weekend though bc it comes out very dark initially!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and quick. I was liking it until I saw the results ... I bought the lightest colors. I&#x27;m blonde and my brows came out black!!!!!!! I looked like an idiot! I had to go get some JOLEN cream bleach to lighten them. I don&#x27;t know if I had faulty product or what but I would be careful using it ... get the lightest color!</li>
    <li> I have very fine, blond brows and most products just don&#x27;t adhere to each downy fine strand. Until now, I was using Just for Men&#x27;s Beard and Mustache color. Yep! I was desperate. But, this is a great product and very long lasting. I left off the 5th star because the applicator sent with the product is just a little stick. Fine for mixing but not for applying. For best results I use an old, clean mascara wand.</li>
    <li> I was a little bit skeptical after reading through several reviews, but I was sick of having to use makeup every day especially in settings where makeup wasn&#x27;t necessary (i.e. camping, swimming, hiking) so I decided to try this out. I have blonde hair but naturally lighter eyebrows but I prefer them a light brown. I used only a little bit of the capsule on the first day for fear of having super dark eyebrows, but it turned out being barely visible so I used a whole capsule the second time. I left it on for 45 second intervals and it turned out being perfect! Definitely use this product if you struggle with having to use makeup all the time.</li>
    <li> I had heard of dying eyebrows but only in salons, so I was surprised when I came across this. I read the reviews and decided to try it. It works very well and you get quite a few applications when you mix small amounts at a time. I will definitely buy this product again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I got the light brown color.  It produced very realistic looking brows.  After I died my brows, I realized I had more of them than I thought.</li>
    <li> I liked this product.It was easy to use.I bought the light brown because I&#x27;m faired skinned and my eyebrows are white.I left it on a little too long though.I only recommend 30 -45 seconds for light brown.It faded a bit after a few days, so I was happy.Definitally cheaper than going to the salon once a month</li>
    <li> it lasts for about a week,i love it.  my eye brows have been tattoed but it needs this little extra. I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I love this product, but you gotta be really carefull applying it. Because if you leave it on for just a bit too long, your eyebrows might be too dark. So make sure to wash it off after about 20 seconds.  And it&#x27;s really long-lasting color, which is great. So i only have to use it once every 3 weeks average.Recommend it, definately.</li>
    <li> I used to apply color daily to my very light eyebrows.  This product has freed me from that chore.  Love, love, love it.  One caveat:  it does work quickly, so to minimize the potential for going too dark, apply it for just a minute, wipe it off, assess the color intensity, then repeat if needed. Each capsule easily makes enough product to do two or three passes per brow.</li>
    <li> I use this product all the time.  I have very light eyebrows and this product works great and it&#x27;s easy to use, not messy at all.  It is a great price and lasts up to a few weeks each treatment and comes with enough to do several times.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I was prepared to give a bad review because separating the capsule was not easy and the contents spilled all over - recommend doing this on a piece of waxed paper so you can get the powder into the mixing &amp;#34;cup.&amp;#34; However, the stuff worked. When I had my eyebrows died at the beauty shop I couldn&#x27;t see a difference, but it looked different with this product and I am happy with the results. I will say that light brown is really kind of a lighter version of dark brown rather than a color with some red or blond in it as light brown usually is. If I had more hair I might find it too dark, but I don&#x27;t so it was okay. I can see where some might find this dark and why it is best to buy on the light side. But, I would rather have it a little dark than blonde as they are naturally as it looked like I had no eyebrows. Now it looks like eyebrows so I am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> i washed my face with The body shop foaming facial wash very nicely and applied this.  followed the direction....waited for 1.5mins....and wiped it off.......NO COLOR!  put the mixture again, waited for 3 mins........WEAK COLOR SHOWED UP!  blah blah agian, waited for another 10 mins....then i got the color on the box.  is there any wrong with my face? how come it takes so much longer time? well, that&#x27;s not a big deal.  the worse thing was, it lasted only for a few days. and it had gone.  did i use this in wrong way? how could i do a better job besides following the direction?  i don&#x27;t want to give any star if i could. waste of money.</li>
    <li> Great product and easy to use. It comes out nicely every time. Good price since there are 4 applications in the box and each application lasts about 4 weeks. Good value.</li>
    <li> first of all: the color is not light brown, is dark brown.&lt;br /&gt;Second of all: the color (&amp;#34;pills&amp;#34;) are very hard to open. One never needs the entire &amp;#34;pill&amp;#34; at once, so it is veeery hard to open and close back the colorant.&lt;br /&gt;third of all: it washes away very easy with water or cream, even when I waited the 24h after coloring.</li>
    <li> I didnt like it all left my eyebrows black.  using a bit of hair dye gives you the color you want. .It may work for those who have very light hair to color but this wasnt for me.</li>
    <li> I have used the Light Brown color and followed the directions on the package including the use of their sticks.&lt;br /&gt;The stick worked just fine for me, but initially I was shocked by a very dark color of the Light Brown tint. I left it on for just 1 minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, after only a few hours I either got used to the outcome or it became a little softer looking upon drying. At any rate, I was overall very pleased with the result. I applied this tint a week ago and so far it&#x27;s still there. I am not sure if it will last 4 weeks as advertised but even a week or two without having have to apply a pencil color on my brows is a relief. And I was surprised to discover that I actually have pretty full brows that got well-defined by the tint. As the color covered my stray grays completely, I feel I look younger as I look in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would improve upon is for the manufacturer to include a dropper for the developer. It&#x27;s very clumsy to be dispensing a thick liquid from a tiny bottle without a dispenser. I am afraid I might have used too much of it (it poured out in a clump) and it will not last me for all the rest of the capsules. By the way, one capsule is enough for at least two applications, so if the developer doesn&#x27;t get used up too quickly, one can stretch the use of the four capsules into eight.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a very good product and a good price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed!  I have dark brown hair and the medium brown was perfect.  I didn&#x27;t have to hurry.  I put it on two times for a minute each time.  I skipped the vasiline.  And I was quickly doing both eyebrows at the same time.  I went back about an hour later, not knowing if it would still work, but I&#x27;d lost my fear of it and it did nicely darken them up.  There were no smells or stinging or skin redness.  And no real staining.  It makes alot of product, so you may be able to use half a capsule.</li>
    <li> I love it, this is the only thing that actually stays on my eyebrow. I always do the extra 30 seconds so it can stay on longer. For me it only stays on for 2 weeks though.</li>
    <li> If i had darker hair the color would be a bit better. This product is not for blonde fair skin people as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have blonde hair and very blonde/light eyebrows, i was hoping after reading others reviews that this would be &amp;#34;the tint&amp;#34; for me if i only left it on for 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, after i wiped it off (after 30 seconds) my eyebrow were dark brown, almost a brown black tint instead a natural brown. I have been trying for two days to lighten them up and they are still grouch O&#x27;Marks dark! I have tried all of the suggested tricks to lighten (shampoo, eye makeup remover for water proof mascara, bleaching them (stupid idea don&#x27;t try), hydrogen peroxide and face wash. Nothing is working. I&#x27;m embarrassed to go to work with the coloring being so off. At least my skin is no longer stained.</li>
    <li> Its not that good. The stain goes away very quickly.  I stopped trying. I even forgot I had it. Lol  It got here ontime though!</li>
    <li> use this often and will continue to do so. its easy and works perfectly to cover most of the grey in my eyebrows!!!</li>
    <li> This dye isn&#x27;t even remotely brown. It turned my blonde brows a horrible greenish gray color. :( Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> The kit you get is not light brown. It is black and the longer you leave it on is how dark it is. They call less time light brown and more jet black. Less time is really just a lighter black. If your hair is truly brown or has any red this doesn&#x27;t match at all.</li>
    <li> not a light brown it is dark. and doesnt do anything or goes way to dark dependinG on the time frame.</li>
    <li> I use a half capsule every four weeks or so.  it is super easy for anyone to do at home.</li>
    <li> I bought this to give some color to my blond eyebrows since I went copper in my hair.  I was really happy with how easy it was to use, but I&#x27;ll probably look for something else next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1.  This product was easy to mix and worked *very* quickly.  I recommend wiping it off after 20-30 seconds (like the instructions say) even if you think you need more color.  Check back in an hour and then re-color if you think you need to.  I didn&#x27;t do this, and re-applied immediately - and ended up with eyebrows much darker than I intended.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The color seems to last at least twice as long as salon tinting does for me.  This would be great if you get the color right on the first try, so be sure not to over-color like I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1.  I do wish the vials of color weren&#x27;t single-use, since I actually ended up wasting most of one capsule.  Much better if you could measure out just as much as you need.  This pretty much forces you to re-purchase after four uses, when you could easily get eight or more from the amount of color provided.&lt;br /&gt;2.  It&#x27;s a fairly &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; brown, so be warned if you&#x27;re looking for something warmer-toned (for, say, copper hair...).  There aren&#x27;t many other choices, though, so this brand just may not be a good one for warm-toned shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with those caveats, I&#x27;ll probably use up this package.  But I&#x27;ll keep trying to find something that seems better for copper hair, or that at least isn&#x27;t pre-measured and wasteful.</li>
    <li> I am strawberry blonde so I am cursed with the dreaded invisible brows and eyelashes. I tried this in the hopes of not having to pencil them in everyday. I was sorely disappointed. The lightest shade they carried was light brown and after keeping the color on for 30 seconds, half the time in the instructions, it turned an intense brown. If you have white blonde eyebrows like me do not buy this product. Consult you hairdresser and ask for advice. I frantically asked my friend who is a hairdresser to help me and she got some color from a professional store.</li>
    <li> My first comment would be that the shade of brown is not warm and it has almost grey undertones more than brown undertones which leads to a somewhat unnatural tinge on the eyebrows. I would also caution anyone using the product to remove it after a maximum of 2 minutes. I have used eyebrow tint on many occasions previously but this is MUCH stronger than other brands and you will end up with very dark eyebrows if you are not careful. I would not buy this product again...it doesn&#x27;t look natural enough and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on my nearly black eyebrows. Better off using facial bleach to lighten the eyebrows as opposed to tinting with this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have blonde hair.  I left the tint on for only a minute (I timed it) thinking that if the tint was too light, I&#x27;d just repeat the process.  I&#x27;m sitting here with dark brown eyebrows.  I made up my eyes and face in an attempt to detract from my Groucho eyebrows.  Didn&#x27;t make a bit of difference.  Guess I&#x27;m just going to look at bit goofy for a few weeks.  Ah well.....no biggie in the big scheme of things.</li>
    <li> This does the job but doesn&#x27;t last as long as it claims. Also, be aware that if you follow the directions exactly, your brows may end up darker than you expect. I re-dye my eyebrows about every week (the little disposable mascara wants from sephora are great for application) using about a third of a capsule and a third of the color developing cream. Easy, affordable, and definitely worth a try for the fair-browed among us.</li>
    <li> Great. Product and easy follow directions! I&#x27;m man on TV and don&#x27;t like the artificial look of mascara! Why go to a salon and pay $25 per treatment?? My only complaint is I ordered 5 items on the same day and this one took the longest to receive. Maybe just a silly mistake.</li>
    <li> I just want to start off by saying that I am a natural redhead- blessed with nearly invisible blonde lashes and eyebrows :-) ..all that to say, I have getting my eyelashes/ brows tinted by a professional for the past couple of years because IT MAKES BEING A GIRL EASIER. I get my lashes tinted black and my eyebrows tinted light brown. In the summer it&#x27;s perfect- no mascara is necessary and filling in eyebrows is now only optional:) I was getting frustrated with spending nearly $50 on the tint session, which like the professional said, would last only about four weeks. I decided to purchase this eyebrow tint in Light Brown and Godefroy Eyelash Tint-black (which I also recommend), because first of all, it&#x27;s cheaper! And second of all, I can choose how light/dark I want my eyebrows to look. I tried the product yesterday, and due to MANY negative reviews, saying the light brown is &amp;#34;way too dark&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;a gross charcoal color,&amp;#34; I decided to be very cautious about timing, etc.&lt;br /&gt;The first tip I want to give you if you have very light brows is to use more white cream (sorry I forgot what it&#x27;s called and am too lazy to check??) than the actual colored powder even though it says 8-10 drops. I probably used..more like 13-15 drops. Basically if the cream looks really dark, IT PROBABLY WILL LOOK THAT WAY on your brows. So lighten it up a bit. Once it is mixed it actually looks more brown/grey than brown/blonde.. so I can see how leaving it on too long or something could cause it too look charcoal-colored. Moving on, I applied the cream on my brows for literally, yes, only 10 seconds because I was scared. [The first time I got my brows tinted I asked for dark brown (unknowingly) and consequently wanted to avoid going in public for four weeks.] The results after 10 seconds: no change. So, I moved to about 30 seconds.. and still didn&#x27;t notice a difference. I tried it for about a minute next, and that&#x27;s when I saw a slight change.. but hardly anything. It was very strange considering so many reviews told me to leave it on for a very short time. Could be that I added more cream initially. I ended up doing countless applications of about 30-60 seconds until it got to a shade that I liked. It was tedious, but nice visible eyebrows would be worth it. I was happy! I was probably in the bathroom for 20-30 minutes perfecting my brows because strangely enough, my light eyebrows did not take in the color very easily. I made sure to have no makeup or oil on my brows beforehand too, so it could just be my hair type too..who knows. But I am content with the product, because though the process took longer, my brows look just a good as they did when I went to a professional. And they look natural, but dark enough to frame my face and bring out my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MOST IMPORTANTLY:&lt;br /&gt;1) this is a GOOD product. Definitely recommend for redheads.&lt;br /&gt;2) don&#x27;t pay attention to the rules: initially leave on the tint for a very short time and slowly add on seconds/minutes until you get the results you like :) also- maybe add more of the cream to the powder so it&#x27;s not so dark to begin with!&lt;br /&gt;3) if you are unsure about adding more color, walk away for a few minutes, look in different lighting, then come back and decide. I think it&#x27;s better for your brows to be too light and able to fix than embarrassingly dark.&lt;br /&gt;4) don&#x27;t use vaseline.. the dye easily comes off the skin. don&#x27;t worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issues I have with this product:&lt;br /&gt;1) The applicator sticks?? Didn&#x27;t like, but I guess they did the job.&lt;br /&gt;2) Occasionally made my skin sting a bit. I do have sensitive skin, and I left it on much longer than recommended, so that could be why.&lt;br /&gt;3) The capsules are annoying to open--&lt;br /&gt;4) The color is nice, but it is NOT what&#x27;s on the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, sorry for the long review, but I hope it helps at least a few people:) Bye.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, I&#x27;m very blonde and this color is great for those who are very fair.  Shows people you actually DO have eyebrows, without being so dark that it looks unnatural.  This is my third time ordering this product and I absolutely love it.  Mind you, eyebrows grow very quickly as well as fall out at a pretty good rate, so you will probably want to re-dye after about 4 weeks, not 6 as noted on the box.</li>
    <li> Despite color saying it is light brown.. unless you are blonde or light colored and want jet black eye brows, you may want to choose a different brand. I tried even diluting these with water to no avail.. it found the garbage very quickly! (Yep should have asked for a refund)  Consider a different brand, I found another one that dilutes well and stays well for several days that is easy and works well.</li>
    <li> This eyebrow tint was super easy and fast to use. I thought it would be be more work than it was. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with it dyeing my skin or anything like that. My only hesitation in giving it 5 stars is that it seems a little ashy to me. I&#x27;d like it have a warmer tone to it. I have naturally blond eyebrows and they picked up the dye in the first 2 minutes like the recommendation. I just dyed them last night for the first time so it&#x27;ll be interesting to see how long it lasts but I can&#x27;t tell you how extatic I am to find an alternative to going to the salon. I typically get this service done at Benefit and with this i&#x27;m spending less than even the tips I&#x27;d typically add! I&#x27;ll definitely continue using the fool proof product.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed to use this and find that it didn&#x27;t really work on me. I followed all of the directions, and my almost invisible blonde brows were slightly darker for about 1 day, and then they went back to normal. I even left the product on for extra time to ensure a nice color, but it didn&#x27;t work :-(</li>
    <li> I am a natural blonde and my eyebrows are quite light. I don&#x27;t know how I went so long using a pencil or powder to darken my eyebrows, but never again! I have used this for almost a year and I love it! It&#x27;s easy to use and I have found that I can mix smaller &#x27;batches&#x27; by only using 1/2 the capsule with 1/2 the required amount of activator. I get the same results, and this box lasts me twice as long!</li>
    <li> I purchased this at a local beauty supply store and got the medium brown color, as my hair is a dark to medium brass brown. I only left the product on for 2 minutes and my eye brows are black! I package is misleading as its states the medium brown is for tan complex people and people with brown hair. I tried scrubbing the dye off, but it was to late, the damage is done.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because of all the good reviews here and it was worth it. The color doesn&#x27;t last 6 weeks but it&#x27;s easy to apply so it doesn&#x27;t matter to me if I have to apply it every other week. It&#x27;s very easy, every capsule lasts for 2-3 pairs of eyebrows and the price is great!</li>
    <li> Godefroy, I&#x27;m so glad we have found each other! My brows, always just fine, have gotten wild, pale, and distracted over the past decade. I can take care of the wild and distracted, but the pale — is just a pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Light Brown is just right for my light blonde coloring, now turning ashy, and about 40% pure white. Initially I tried the medium brown and graphite brow coloring, but the light brown is really the perfect shade. It is cool, subtle, not warm or reddish, which can be a real problem with many brow pencils and powders. If you&#x27;re a blonde, you probably need a cool or ashy brow, and this is just right. Depth of color can be controlled by timing — if you are super pale, try a very short coloring. This will never be darker than a light brown, though, even if you use the maximum time.</li>
    <li> I have quite a few gray hair in my eyebrows and this stain did the trick.  I usually have medium brown eyebrows but I bought the light brown because my hair is now blonde.  This was easy to use once it is mixed together and the color is so lifelike.  It covers the gray with no problem and doesn&#x27;t come off when washing my face.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to darken some of the blonde hairs around my eyebrows to make them look fuller and this did the trick, but since I use a clarisonic every night, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last for very long. Also, one capsule can be used for 2-3 times, not just once. Don&#x27;t waste your money on using the whole thing. I&#x27;ll use the box up, but I&#x27;m not sure I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I am fair and even with a little bit of sun my eyebrows start to turn white. This give just the right amount of natural color and is easy to apply and takes just under 5 minutes for both brows!</li>
    <li> the dye was gone in 2 days from my eyebrows. didn&#x27;t apply well at all. actually it&#x27;s a toothpick they have you apply it with which goes over and through the hairs not onto them. HORRIBLE PRODUCT!@</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time, and went strictly by the timing directions for the first eyebrow, it came out great looking, color was perfect.  Then when I was doing the second eyebrow, I for some unknown reason, decided to reapply the first eyebrow with more color and left it on, only about 30 more seconds, but what a mistake, now both are too dark.  I now know that the timing is everything, and even 20 seconds makes a big difference.  I know my brows will fade, they are already tolerable, so I love the product.  Works much better than the hair dye I was using to color the gray in them.  I suggest to anyone doing this for the first time to take the color off after the recommended time and only reapplying if they are way too light, and then only leave it on for seconds more.</li>
    <li> I used Roux Eyebrow and Eyelash Dye for years and aside from the fact that it was very toxic and chemically it didn&#x27;t really work. Godefroy Instant Eyebrow Tint is super easy to use, NO TOXIC fumes either, and dyes much much better than Roux dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have is trying to figure out how long to keep it on to get every hair dyed but without getting too dark. I&#x27;ve been having to bleach my eyebrows after I&#x27;m done. I have very light blond hair so light brown isn&#x27;t quite light enough for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased the \\&quot;light brown\\&quot; because the \\&quot;medium brown\\&quot; that I&#x27;d used previously was a little too dark.  The \\&quot;light brown\\&quot; is even darker than the \\&quot;medium brown\\&quot; was, per my experience.  I am very disappointed. I looked like some sort of monster after using this product, as apparently I left it on too long. I will have to watch the second hand on the clock very closely to make sure to NOT leave it on more than 20 seconds, and then immediately wash off the dye, next time I use it.</li>
    <li> An excellent option if you don&#x27;t like drawing on or filling in your eyebrows with makeup every days. A number of people recommend not leaving this on more than 30 seconds to a minute. I seem to have stubborn hair so I leave it on for about 2-3 minutes, but that&#x27;s it! I recommend doing this when you don&#x27;t have public plans the next day the first few times you do this because it will be overly dark the first few days and you are likely to get outside your natural/intended brow area.&lt;br /&gt;I work outside in the Texas heat and in the water, so makeup would be a horrible choice for me. This makes a major difference in how much I worry about my appearance.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It is easy to use and lasts at least 3 weeks.  The light brown is a perfect color for me.  My eyebrows are very light, but this product makes them the appropriate color to match my hair.  I love products that reduce the need to apply makeup every day and save time.  This is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I always use this product, Fast shipment, Thanks</li>
    <li> Looks good, but doesn&#x27;t last very long, maybe a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Worthless save your money!</li>
    <li> Color too dark, my brows look jet black, even only after 2 minutes I will not buy this item again.</li>
    <li> i have pale blonde eyebrows and used eyebrow pencil to give my face some features.  Was looking at the product with a beach vacation in mind.  Read all the reviews with helpful application tips. I put vaseline around the brow area.  The product come in powder form in capsules (  i think 4), that you can pull apart.  you mix the powder with the liquid and apply to brows.  you can use maybe 1/4 of the capsule, it goes a long way.  I then used a eyelash/brow brush to brush and spread the dye evenly.  i waited 30 secs and wiped off.  if it&#x27;s not dark enough you can easily do it again.  it lasts a week or 2 and then i redo. it takes a couple of minutes, no bother, and i am so impressed than it doesn&#x27;t dye my skin, only my brows.  it looks so natural, much better than pencil.   You must try this!</li>
    <li> Perfect for darkening blonde/light brows.  I use 1/2 capsule by gently tapping out a bit at a time into the mixing bowl, then put the capsule back together.  Also, rather than using vaseline or other products around the brow which might cause areas where the dye doesn&#x27;t take, I only use an inexpensive slender hobby brush called a liner brush made of synthetic fiber (I use Taklon because natural-hair brushes will shed badly) for application - makes it easier and no smudges if you have a fairly steady hand (just clean the liner brush with soap and water afterward to re-use).  You can find these brushes in any hobby shop or the hobby section of Walmart.  In case of smudges, a Q-tip with baby oil removes all smudges easily and thoroughly - but do this after you begin timing.    Timing is the key.  Try 30 seconds initially.  You can always apply more and leave on another 15-20 seconds.  Have damp cotton balls or paper towels ready for quick removal - this product dyes quickly and the longer you leave it on, the darker it becomes!     I am pretty fast with the brush, so I try to *quickly* do both brows at once so the color is uniform on both and begin timing immediately. If you haven&#x27;t done this before, just do one brow at a time - again, quickly as possible and begin your timing.  You can remove smudges during the timing.    Typically, 45 seconds is perfect for me as I have light/medium hair and blonde brows, but since the amount of powder and developer is never exact each time, perhaps it&#x27;s best to time a little less.    Pros:  Fast, doesn&#x27;t take much time  Easy to apply with the right tool  Gentle on the brows, even for those with sensitive skin  Priced reasonably per application    Cons:  Timing is key - work quickly and time immediately  Lasts about 3 weeks and begins to fade after the first week    I used to purchase hair dye kits and use those for brows only - expensive and time consuming.  This product works much better for me.</li>
    <li> I am naturally blonde and so are my eyebrows which makes me look like I don&#x27;t have any unless I use eyebrow pencil. I tried this product thinking I wouldn&#x27;t have to mess with a pencil every day, but even though I got the lightest shade available, it&#x27;s much too dark. I tried leaving it on shorter and shorter times (30 sec) and still it looks almost black. I guess more like a really dark grey. But it does color and lasts a long time just wish it came in a dark blonde.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest; my problem with this product could be my fault. But I doubt it. I have fair skin and, generally, nearly invisible ash medium blonde/gray brows. I usually color them with light warm brown or dark warm blonde hair color. Or I ask my hairstylist to do it. So I thought it would be fun to try this product and it gets good reviews, for the most part. I followed instructions for using the light brown. My brows are now a Groucho-black-dark, dark, dark (did I mention &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34;?) chocolate-tar-brown. So I&#x27;m sitting here, on my bathroom floor, writing this review on my ipad--my little take on this hair dye. This dye could darken tree bark, people. For some of you lovely ones who can use that kind of concentration to color your brows, I am happy for you. You&#x27;ll be fine, just use caution also. For those who meet my description, do not buy this product in Light Brown, or, better yet, at all.&lt;br /&gt;Also,  I know this is wasteful, but buy a well-reviewed hair dye kit like L&#x27;Oreal or Clairol, use what you need, and dispose of the rest. In my experience, those are a lot more dependable. And go light. You can always go darker or even carefully apply more once you&#x27;ve removed your first application. And, depending on your face cleanser&#x27;s ingredients, it will last just about as long as this product.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Nothing is better than having them professionally done, but this is a great replacement!  Give yourself some expression and try this product!</li>
    <li> If I could give it zero stars or negative stars, I would. It was supposed to be LIGHT BROWN. I followed the directions to the letter, used all the \\&quot;tips\\&quot;, too. I applied it and almost immediately wiped it off because I was afraid of getting my brows too dark. Directions stated it could be reapplied to desired darkness. OMG! This gunk turned my eyebrows BLACK in less than 10 seconds! I&#x27;m a natural blonde with even lighter blonde highlights, blue eyes, and fair skin. I was tired of brow powder, pencil, wax, and gel because it always wares off. Well, I certainly was punished for my laziness! THEY WERE BLACK!!! I can&#x27;t have black eyebrows! I looked ridiculous! I had to send my husband to the drug store to buy some light blonde hair dye, so I could lighten them up. Of course, they turned red. So, off he goes again, back to the drug store to get some medium blonde hair dye. I finally got them fixed to an acceptable color, but my skin was raw, red, and stung for several days. I threw it in the garbage where it belongs. Forget this stuff. From now on, I&#x27;ll just use regular hair dye (very carefully, of course). HORRIBLE!</li>
    <li> I gave the product 2 stars on ease of use and how well it dyed my eyebrows. After reading reviews and comments, I decided to give it a shot even though I have very sensitive skin and the product did not appear to contain chemicals I know I am allergic to.   After the allergy test of 48 hours lapsed and no reaction, I went for it.  I only left the product on my brows for a total of 45 seconds and wooooow did they come out dark, 5 days later and they haven&#x27;t faded much.  The third day, over 72 hours later HOLY ALLERGIC REACTION BATMAN!I even had to go to the allergist to get steroid cream to calm down the giant red throbbing welts under my eyebrows.  My dr advised me reactions can take up to 96 hours some times. So, this product is effective and easy to use, however, if you have sensitive skin or chemical allergies - run away.</li>
    <li> This product does not lightening your eye brows. It makes them black!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, color is good, lasts like it should.  I only use half a capsule at a time, though.</li>
    <li> I like this product--I have blonde eyebrows and spending 15 minutes once every couple weeks is far preferable than penciling in color every day. It&#x27;s easy to use and not too messy. However, it doesn&#x27;t last long at all, far less than the box indicates. I get two weeks out of it at best. Not a huge deal, as it&#x27;s not too expensive. I do recommend getting the inexpensive mascara wands to apply it, rather than using the little sticks in the package. It goes on a lot more easily and evenly.</li>
    <li> Not bad.not super easy, but decent results if you take your time. I just wish the results lasted a little longer. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the fault of the product, more so the nature of the hair on your eyebrows. But it&#x27;s quite a bit of work for results that only seem noticeable for maybe 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I have gold/blonde hair and bought the light brown.  Use the product as directed - I did it once, and wanted darker brows and the second time was perfect. I left the product on about 3 minutes the second time.</li>
    <li> Works great! awesome price!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find this online, unable to find anything else with reviews as good as here.  How I was deceived!!!  I have naturally blond hair and wanted to tint my eyebrows LIGHT BROWN.  I followed the instructions and even had it on for LESS TIME then suggested and now my eyebrows are charcoal (light black color). It&#x27;s not even close to a brown tint!  I&#x27;m SO DISAPPOINTED! The package says light brown, but don&#x27;t be deceived! I will not buy this again.  I would rather get my original tint shipped from overseas!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I continue to order it over and over again because it works!  I have blonde eye brows so need just that extra little bit of color in my brows in order to see them.  You do have to be carful about getting the dye on the skin around your browns, but I just frame the hair of my brows with Vaseline before I start and then it comes off where it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> Worked well.  Bought more today.</li>
    <li> Well just like many others my eyebrows are now black, not a nice warm &amp;#34;light brown&amp;#34; as I had imagined from the description and picture on the box. I left it on exactly 1 minute and yeah, not good. I&#x27;m naturally blonde and now look like a clown with ashy black eyebrows. I&#x27;ll be leaving my benzoyl peroxide cleanser on longer than normal in hopes of fading this nasty color.  How embarrassing!!</li>
    <li> Best eyebrow tint on the market.  Great price.  Very easy to use once you figure out how to balance the powder dye and the activator (not hard at all...I&#x27;ve never messed it up).  I would advise to use a magnifying mirror and spread it just over your visible brow.  The tint can temporarily stain your skin, but don&#x27;t freak out, it comes off in the shower with a washcloth  I felt like my eyebrows were disappearing over the years, but after my sister introduced me to this product, I felt like it was 20 years ago.  Big beautiful eyebrows once again.  They are there, you just need to bring them out.  The directions say it lasts 6 weeks, but I apply every 4 and it maintains my brows perfectly.  A must have.</li>
    <li> I usually get my eyebrows tinted professionally, as I am blonde. Now that I have this great product I am able to quickly and so easily do it at home.  This product is so easy to use.  I highly recommend it.  Color lasts a few weeks.  Such a convenience!</li>
    <li> I bought this to try and darken some of my blonder hairs in my eyebrows to create a better brow shape.  This product is very easy to use and works quickly, and wipes off with only a wet paper towel.  So as far as dying goes it&#x27;s about the easiest product I&#x27;ve used.  The problem is the light brown isn&#x27;t suited for light brown eyebrows.  After following the directions to leave on for 1-2 min, my brows are more of a faded dark brown/black, which is not what I would have expected.  Even if I had left it on for less time, it&#x27;s clear from the color capsule that the dye is a dark brown shade, so you won&#x27;t be able to get a warm medium shade from it.  So yes the product tints but my brows definitely don&#x27;t match my hair color the way I&#x27;d hoped.  If you have blonde or light brown hair, you will not get a natural looking tint from this product.  If you have dark brown hair then I think you would be very happy.  I think I will try a different product next time.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this eyebrow dye! I have VERY light  eyebrows and used to have to fill them in with makeup every morning. I was embarassed to be caught without makeup and thought that I had hardly any eyebrows. This dye darkens the eyebrow hairs so it looks completely natural. It revealed so many eyebrow hairs that I couldn&#x27;t even see before. The color lasts about a month on my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> This dye lasts for about 4 weeks.  It is NOT light brown.  It is a very dark brown that will fade.  If you want to dye your eyebrows for an occasion, do it TWO days before your event.  I like dying my eyebrows because it gets all the little hairs so my eyebrows look fuller.  The day I dye them, I look like Groucho Marx...so be forewarned.</li>
    <li> I have been using this in medium brown for over a year, and it is great! so much product for the price, and my eyebrows look great! totally recommend...I mean why not give it a try for the great price</li>
    <li> Made my eyebrows jet black! I do not recommend this at all unless you want to darken your brows! The light brown only has black in it!</li>
    <li> It works very well when you follow the other users instructions (don&#x27;t leave it on more than 30 seconds, etc.) but the color turned a light black,  not brown, on my eyebrows. I loved the convenience, but the color is black not brown, so it didn&#x27;t quite work with my skin color; it was a little harsh.</li>
    <li> Just take note that if your hair is ashy blonde/medium brown, this won&#x27;t lighten them. I have a mix of ash and transparent baby blonde hairs. The blonde ones darkened nicely, so this worked for me.</li>
    <li> This dye works REALLY quickly, and it&#x27;s true that you need less than one of the powder packets to do both of your eyebrows. I cracked open the powder capsule, used maybe 1/4 of it, and dumped the rest in a little storage baggie. My brows are naturally almost see-through they&#x27;re so light, and the light brown turned out a tad too dark after I left the dye on for 1 minute. Next time I&#x27;d leave it on for maybe 30 seconds, just quickly apply it, take a breath, and wipe it off.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I don&#x27;t like how light my eyelashes are. This darkens with a natural look. I don&#x27;t like wearing make up so this is perfect.</li>
    <li> I have blonde eyebrows and get tired of  having to use brow color, which wears off by end of day. As others stated, this tint  does get very dark if you leave on too long.  I have been using with a #30 developer , my brows don&#x27;t turn really dark brown. They  are  lighter than if I use the developer that came with the kit.  Color lasts for weeks, you can dye your brows at least two times with one capsule.  I will definitely order again from Amazon, I cannot find it  in stores. My sister likes it too.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS HARD TO GET AN EVEN COLOR ON BOTH BROWS.  ALSO, IF YOU HAVE ANY THIN OR SPARSE BROWS YOU WILL GET BARE SPOTS.  COLOR IS UNNATURAL AND BEST APPLIED WITH A QTIP, RATHER THAN ENCLOSED APPLICATOR THAT DOESN&#x27;T WORK AT ALL.</li>
    <li> My sisters and I have struggled for years with light, thinning eyebrows.  We gave up the pencils, brushes and waxes after getting this product.  It is so very easy to use.  Two minutes!  That&#x27;s all!  It would take that long to do the pencil, fill-in with color, and set with the gel or wax.  As with any eyebrow tint, the color does not last too long.  I re-apply about every two weeks, and will do so without complaint. Just put on, leave two minutes, and wipe off.  After using this product for nearly 6 months now, I have become more proficient in the application.  I would not go back to using my old products to do my eyebrows.  Have shared with my sisters and now all of us use this.</li>
    <li> I was paying twenty bucks to get my eyebrows tinted, not realizing how easy it is to do yourself. I make this kit last even longer by only using half a capsule at a time. Even that makes more color than I need to do my brows.  I tried the medium brown first but it was too dark even though I am a brunette. The light brown gives me a more natural color. Love it!</li>
    <li> The colour tint comes in capsules and there are only 4 capsules in this kit.  Therefore, I was disappointed to discover that you can only do 4 applications with this kit.  If I had known this before I bought it, I would have chosen something else.</li>
    <li> My eyebrows were turning grey and I was tired of using a eye brow pencil everyday. This product was easy to use and is very long lasting.  Has been weeks and my eye brows still look great. I highly recommend. :)</li>
    <li> I have strawberry blond hair and similar color brows that aren&#x27;t very visible.  This product is amazing. I got the light brown and only leave it on 1 1/2 - 2 minutes.  You must be careful when applying it to stay only on the brow line hairs you want to color. Also, it seems a little too dark for a day or two and then is perfect. During that day or two you can dust some light makeup over to tone them down.  It is much, much cheaper than having them tinted for $20-25 at a salon, and only takes 5 minutes total.</li>
    <li> It was relatively easy to use but came out darker than I expected!</li>
    <li> I was looking for an eyebrow tint that I could use at home as an alternative to my recent salon tints.  I found the product easy to mix and apply.  I followed the advise of another reviewer that used the wooden tips with a thin wisp of cotton wrapped tightly around the tip.  After using this application successfully a couple of times, I would think a Q-Tip would prevent as much control as what is needed when putting the dye on your brows and you would end up with more on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up applying from the outside of the brow inward and in the opposite direction of the hair growth.  This successfully got the majority of the dye on the actual hairs than the surrounding skin.  I left the dye on for 30 seconds and wiped it off with a wet cotton ball, followed by a dry one.  I have blonde eyebrows so the first 30 second application left me with a very light dye, not much darker than my natural color.  I applied one more 30 second round and was left with a light to medium brown tint, which is what I was shooting for.  I ended up not using Vaseline on my skin because if you&#x27;re using multiple applications in one sitting to build up to your ideal color, you&#x27;ll end up swiping the Vaseline into the eyebrow hair so I would think the second app won&#x27;t take as well.  I went slowly and used the other end of the wooden stick to quickly &#x27;scrape&#x27; off any product that got on my skin.  No skin staining if you catch it fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may have to re-tint more often if you go for a lighter brown,or you may be able to go a little bit darker than what you intend and get a little more &#x27;wear&#x27; out of it.  My eyebrow tints done at the salon were always a little different each time - darker/lighter.  Once you get the timing down, I would imagine it will be more consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package includes 5 ampules that will provide about three applications.  They&#x27;re hard to get open but I was able to work one apart and then put it back together with the remaining product inside for the next use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After tip I was paying about $20 a pop at the salon so if you figure $15 for the package and 15 uses, I&#x27;m saving quite a bit of moolah.</li>
    <li> No matter what color you purchase, your brows stay dark brown for several days, eventually lightening up.  Do not extend the time it stays on your brows, or your skin will discolor and take several days before you stop looking like Groucho Marx.</li>
    <li> I could hardly wait to receive this and give it a try.  One of the most disappointing products I have ever used.  Worthless.</li>
    <li> This was easy to use and the color turned out good.  I think the first time is always a little scary, but everything turned out fine.</li>
    <li> Does not lighten your eyebrows. Turned mine black :(</li>
    <li> Just received this product today and already in love with it! I would definitelly recommend it to all the women out there.it was easy to use and I&#x27;m very happy with the results. I have very light eyebrows and hate the way I look without any brow makeup. this brow tint did exactly what I wanted it to do! Love the way look now! Not sure how long it will last, but I think it&#x27;s still worth a try!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last more than two weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m blonde, and have been using bleaching products to tone down my natural light brown eyebrows a little bit in order to soften my look.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always wanted a more specific look, kind of a dark blonde, light brown color to my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;Something like the color that appears on the box right next to the words &amp;#34;light brown&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pretty much made my not-so-dark eyebrows.. almost black.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, I did buy another box of the eyebrow bleach, so I was able to fix it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s looking to darken their eyebrows, not give them a different color necessarily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been tinting my naturally bleach blonde brows (I&#x27;m strawberry blonde) for almost 5 years now and originally used Roux lash and brow tint, which is so messy. It immediately stains your skin even with the help of vaseline and the stain removal liquid. With Godefry, the consistancy is thicker and easier to maneuver. One capsule has lasted me 2 months (I only use enough powder to get one session done) and the color has a pretty good staying power. A few things:&lt;br /&gt;1) With the light brown I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s better to keep it on for 12-14 minutes otherwise the color barely develops. This color is very light and perfect for blondes or redheads, but if you don&#x27;t put it on long enough the color is barely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;2) The color barely has any red tint to it, which is a good thing. I hate trying to dye my brows with a brown tint and have them come out orange.&lt;br /&gt;3) I found youtube videos incredibly helpful to understand how to put it on correctly (although it is fairly self-explanatory)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase again. If you have darker hair than blonde or strawberry blonde though, I would recommend going a shade darker. I still apply light brown eyebrow powder to my brows to define the shape everyday, which overall darkens them more but I could probably get by with one shade darker of this product too.</li>
    <li> I ordered the light brown and I think the color is fantastic.  So much better than the color they used on me at a salon!</li>
    <li> light brown was too light, it just looks blonde to me when I used it.  No I would not buy it again</li>
    <li> wife speaking again. I was nervous about using this at first, but once I did, I love it. It looks so natural and it was so easy!!!</li>
    <li> I have blonde eyebrows and I wanted to color them to be a brown color.  This kit was pretty simple to use and worked pretty fast (1-2minutes per eyebrow).  I did have to use a few applications becuase I was worried that I would get too dark, but it worked pretty well.  The only issue I had with this product was the color.  I bought the light brown color and I hoped my eyebrows would look like the color of the white lady on the box.  It didn&#x27;t turn out like that, the color seems to be black, though not dark black, if that makes any sense.  I still colored them in with my pencil and they look pretty good.  I used baby oil to surround my eyebrows and what coloring that was on my skin came off in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, pretty good product.  I think I will try something else next time to try to find a color that I like.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a few years and am happy with it.  I&#x27;ve tried the dark, medium and light brown and I think they&#x27;re probably all the same thing.  I have dark brown eyebrows and am dying the white ones.  To fully cover the white, I have to leave it on over 2 minutes, resulting in almost black brows.  They fade a bit after a few days.</li>
    <li> Be careful and do not go too dark.  Love the product.</li>
    <li> First off do not use the whole capsule, it would make too much tint.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased an angled brow brush to apply, I did not have enough control&lt;br /&gt;with the sticks. Finally, apply and leave on for a couple of minutes,&lt;br /&gt;if you want it darker reapply. The color was good but lasts only a&lt;br /&gt;couple of weeks not the 6 as the box says.</li>
    <li> This product is definitely worth the risk! I was terrified to try at home brow dying and read about it alot. Godefroy was highly recommended and I did take other reviewers experiences into account when I tried it on myself at home - better safe than sorry! So I only used a portion of the capsule mixed in the bowl of a spoon and applied in a :30 second interval, reapplying as necessary depending on the depth of color I wanted. The color was a touch dark at first but not at all off-putting and mellowed beautifully. I will definitely use this project again!</li>
    <li> I have medium brown hair and shock-blonde eyebrows, and use the light brown brow dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just in case anyone is interested in the procedure, you apply vaseline around your brows with a q-tip, then apply the dye for some appropriate time. I only use about a quarter of a cap, and I mix it with minimal gloop (technical word). I make sure to cake the dye on once I&#x27;m putt it on my face. It takes a try or two to figure out how long works for you. Personally, I&#x27;m generally a minute and a half, though I wipe off the outer edges earlier (I notice that they tend to stain faster than the inner edges). I often still wind up with a harsh dye line on my skin, so I use a little astringent and soap and scrub to get a more natural look. I still apply a filler during the day, but it&#x27;s not necessary at this point, it&#x27;s just a vanity. Overall the whole process takes me about 5 minutes, once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, the color requires personal tuning. You have to experiment, so don&#x27;t use this the first time you&#x27;re going out on a date or something. But once you&#x27;ve figured it out it&#x27;s quite nice. So I give 4 stars for not being the easiest to use, but still providing beautiful results once you&#x27;ve figure it out.</li>
    <li> I always use regular permanent hair color on my eyebrows, its lasts longer and is easier to use.  easier to use.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for well over a year.  The only complaint I have is that it is difficult to apply using their tools.  I use a tiny brush that came with my powder eyebrow makeup from years past.</li>
    <li> I got light brown. (I&#x27;m a natural blonde with blonde brows) I followed instructions to the t.  The result was black eyebrows.  Blacker than my eyelashes.  ugh.</li>
    <li> This product is ok, but its too dark for me, it looks like a deep dark brown almost black. Not what I expected.</li>
    <li> My natural hair color base is a dark ash blonde but I have dyed blonde highlights on top of that, and my eyebrows are pretty much nonexistent and very sparse at each end.  I usually use ash blonde liner to fill them in, which makes them look kind of fake and too perfect.  I was going for dark blonde/light brown eyebrows, so I bought the light brown dye and read many reviews before starting anything.  I initially followed the tips about the vaseline around the eyebrow, applying with the eyebrow brush instead of the enclosed sticks, and using less than 1/4 of the capsule.  The dyeing process just took way too long, maybe because the hair is so sparse anyway.  It was also difficult to gauge how much developer to use, and it ended up stinging a little.  I panicked when I saw these white spots develop under the hair, and immediately thought I was allergic. I think I used too much developer, so I  waited a few minutes and the spots disappeared, thank God.  After all that, I tossed the mix and started all over with a new capsule and new mix.  This time around, I followed the enclosed instructions by starting out with a whole capsule and 9 drops of developer.  I didn&#x27;t bother with the vaseline because it goes on so thick; it&#x27;s easy to just follow your natural eyebrow line and it really doesn&#x27;t stain the skin around if you wipe well.  I applied a thick coat from end to end and kept it on for about 30 seconds.  Then I wiped hard with a wet paper towel.  The dye came out much darker and more evenly.  It only took two tries to get the color I wanted and to match both brows.  I don&#x27;t think anyone needs to panic with this stuff like I did and be so careful.  You can mess around later with the percentages of developer vs capsule when you become more confident with mixing/applying. Just follow the instructions and you will be fine.  If you want to ensure they don&#x27;t get too dark right off the bat, just wipe after 10 seconds and try again, one eyebrow at a time.</li>
    <li> This product works well but in my opinion the colors run dark if you leave it on even just a few seconds longer than the instructions state.  I got light brown and my eyebrows were BLACK. Luckily I was able to scrub some of the color out until they looked normal.  Bottom line,  the product works and the color lasts as advertised well but the colors run dark. Follow the instructions down to the second.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well, color&#x27;s not bad (I used light brown, and I&#x27;m fair skinned with red hair). I had to stop using this after a few times, though, because it made my eyes and skin red and itchy. I dye my brows with Suriya Henna Cream now (also available on Amazon.)</li>
    <li> Okay to be honest this product will tint your eyebrows and it stays for about 3-4 weeks and it&#x27;s very easy to use. If your are looking for something to &amp;#34;fill in&amp;#34; bare spots in your brows this won&#x27;t do it. The product will not tint your skin it will come off your skin in about 2-3 hours and totally once you wash your face. So all in all the product does tint your eyebrows but if you have thinning brows and bare spots like mine it will not tint your skin, for that fuller brow look. Hope this helps if anyone else was considering this for bare spots or fill ins.</li>
    <li> Really great product. Easy to use and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great for scattered gray in eyebrows.  Problem is that it has to be treated often to get a lasting result.  Would like a more permanent product next time.</li>
    <li> Top five beauty necessity for those over 50 losing the ends of their eyebrows.  Easy + very fast to apply + long lasting.  If it&#x27;s your first use and you&#x27;re guessing, recommend you opt for a lighter choice than your instinct suggests you need, unless your hair is very dark.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and I appreciate all of the tips. This was so quick and easy! I, too, only mixed half the capsule with an equivalent amount of developer. Then I used a Q-tip to apply Vaseline around my brows to protect skin. I used a disposable sponge tipped make-up applicator to apply the tint because it was what I had on hand. It worked fine though I will probably use a brush or a disposable mascara wand next time. I left the color on about 30 seconds and wiped off with a damp paper towel. I also ended up washing my brows with Cetaphil afterward.&lt;br /&gt;For me, the color is great. I have light brown hair and my eyebrows are a light to medium brown. I may leave on longer next time but, thanks to all the reviews, I knew it may develop quickly so I decided to be extra cautious. This is a great cost and time saver. No more brow pencil, no more driving to, and paying, a salon. I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I purchased the \\&quot;light brown\\&quot; eyebrow tint because I am a blonde with very light eyebrows. The ad said that \\&quot;light brown\\&quot; was for \\&quot;blondes and redheads\\&quot;. The recommended time for allowing the goop to stay on your brows was 1-2 minutes. I did as instructed and the results were HORRIBLE. My brows were a nasty shade of charcoal black. It was so unappealing and so unnatural looking that I had to go that very day to purchase a \\&quot;hair color removal\\&quot; kit and apply it to my brows tone to down the black. Now my brows are a weird grey color and I have to apply light brown eyebrow pencil over them. It was a very disappointing experience and there is nothing \\&quot;light brown\\&quot; about it, even the capsules were a dark brown. I do not recommend this product to anyone with blonde or red hair unless you want ugly black brows. I cannot wait until it fades. YUCK.</li>
    <li> I am a natural redhead with light blonde eyebrows, and I was looking for a way to make my eyebrows visible without having to draw them in every day. I turned to this product because it was cheap and looked promising. For the price this is a great product... for someone who DOESN&#x27;T have copper undertones in their hair. Right after you dye your eyebrows, they turn out to be a dark greyish brown color. The color does fade and looks a bit better after a few days, but the grey undertones don&#x27;t look natural with my red hair. Overall, good product for people who don&#x27;t have copper undertones in their hair...</li>
    <li> light brown is way too dark! I only left it on for 1 minute this time and it was still too dark</li>
    <li> I have been using this dye for a year now and it is very easy to use and quick too. The color lasts a long time and is nice and dark. It washes off of skin easily too so its very convenient.</li>
    <li> Okay, I was scared to death to try this product due to the mixed reviews. I&#x27;m so glad I did!! I read every review before I applied it and the key is in the timing. I have very thin blonde eyebrows. After reading other reviews I decided to apply the color for 20 seconds. This worked well, but I wanted the shade a little darker, so I re-applied it for about 10 more seconds. This gave me the perfect shade! I only used half of the capsule; it was plenty. I&#x27;m so excited that I won&#x27;t have to apply pencil everyday.  Great product!</li>
    <li> this does darken your brows, but the color is determined by the length of time you leave it on.  The minimum time to acquire light brown resulted in a brownish, but not the beautiful light brown shown on the package.  If you leave it on longer, it will be black, so you only need the one package for any color.</li>
    <li> I ordered both eyelash tint and eyebrow tint as I have very little color in either my lashes or brows.  The brow tint took about 3 times to get my brows dark enough - used light brown.  I did not want to look like I had caterpillar brows so was glad I went with the lighter color.  Several weeks later I still can see my brows and would order this product again.  Was very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have virtually see-through eyebrows... I tried getting them done at the salon, and they looked great, but it was pricey. This takes about 5 minutes at home and works well. I left mine on for 60 seconds to be safe, then put more on for another 30. I still use a bit of eyebrow gel over the top but its better than never seeing my eyebrows!</li>
    <li> Afforable, good quality product and also worth it compare to others I have been using his same brand for a long time.</li>
    <li> This gets 2 stars because its easy to use, works fast, and is a reasonable price. But the color on the box, \\&quot;light brown\\&quot;, ended up being a very dark grayish black! Now I look like I put sharpie marker on my face, making it a waste of money. So unless you have really dark hair, and like getting \\&quot;mystery\\&quot; color brows, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> At first most people said to keep it on for 30 seconds but I ended up needing to put it on for 20 minutes just to get it to a light brown. It hasn&#x27;t faded away/ completely yet and it&#x27;s been about a month. But I noticed I lost a little eyebrow hair. Not a lot just maybe 5-7 but they grew back soon and it&#x27;s all good. The reviews are really helpful.</li>
    <li> So I have become an expert on dying your eyebrows yourself. I&#x27;m a natural redhead with blond eyebrows and lashes so tinting my brows is a regular routine.  For years I used the Roux Eyebrow Tint and was continually frustrated when large bottles of fluid went bad after only 3-4 uses. I thought the Roux would be the best buy for the money because of the amount of product but every time I bought it, I was able to use less than 25% of the bottles before the clear fluid turned brown and while it would still color my brows, it would wear off in only a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I discovered the Godefroy. First, let me say the process is easy, the color is good, and it lasts longer than the Roux ever did! However, the box says 6 weeks - don&#x27;t count on it. You&#x27;ll need to redo it about every 3(but the Roux never lasted more than 2 so I&#x27;m still happy). The powder capsules are a little awkward to work with but as other reviewers have noted, there is easily enough powder in each capsule for two full applications. So if you&#x27;re careful when you open the capsules, you can use only half of the powder and double the life of the box to 8 applications. If you&#x27;re brows are thin, you might even get 3!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When choosing the color, choose the shade lighter than you think you need. It&#x27;s DARK!! And the first time, doing 30 seconds at a time is a great idea until you see how your brows react. And use some kind of oil or vaseline on the surrounding skin and you won&#x27;t get the Groucho effect.  Great product!!!</li>
    <li> excellent, lasts for at least four weeks, great price, easy to use, much more economical than the day spas.  Arrived on time, as described.</li>
    <li> The tint only lasts about a day, but it&#x27;s a good thing if you add too much of the dye as I have done a few times.</li>
    <li> Just followed the instructions for light brown to a \\&quot;T\\&quot; and got perfectly desireable results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had first read through the feedback in reviews listed here.  Made certain to apply petroleum jelly around my brows liberally.  Used only 1/2 a capsule.  Did one brow at a time to be better able to monitor coverage.  Reapplied to grey areas for an extra minute.  Perfect.  I will be using this product frequently.</li>
    <li> I have a lack of eyebrows from over-plucking and from being Irish lol. So i depend on this stuff, and I count on it to stain my actual skin rather than the hairs because there are few hairs. but this will stain the skin; put vaseline around the brow to control the stain or use a stencil.</li>
    <li> When I first started using this it worked great. East to do and lasted almost 2.5 weeks. They changed something and it lasts for about 5 days now. Extremely displeased. Im guessing they changed their formula or something.</li>
    <li> This is so easy to use and works great! I actually like to leave it on for 3 minutes and really darken my brows. I apply it with a q-tip as I think it&#x27;s easier. You can even just use about half the powder at once and save the other half in some kind of container to get more applications out of it. I always want to touch up after two weeks; if it lasted 4 weeks for me, I&#x27;d give it five stars.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and I love the product.  I had not used the Light Brown before and I think I need to use a Medium Brown.</li>
    <li> If you leave this product on your brows longer than 5 mins they turn black. For me 3 mins after applying the tint worked well. Perfect for filling gaps in eyebrows and achieving the high arch look.</li>
    <li> They try marketing this product as different shades of brown, but really it&#x27;s all one color.  You are not going to get a rich color when you get a light brown or medium brown box.  It is all the same!  The color is black- faded to jet.  And jet black is what you&#x27;ll likely get if you leave on longer than a minute.  Redheads beware!  This will not look good on you.  There are better products than this with more color and more applications per box.  Don&#x27;t do it!</li>
    <li> So if i dont darken my brows i look albino, figured i would try this i have red hair and white brows and lashes. package said to leave on for 1 min i think should have done 10 seconds my brows were black. had to cream bleach them to look semi normal 1 month in and they are good but really be careful how long you leave it on. do it 2x if needed. 10 seconds at a time if you are VERY light as I am</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t do what I had hoped for (Color individual white brows).  It seemed to darken the naturally light brown hairs and almost be repelled by the white hairs which made them even more obvious.  Oh well, age happens.</li>
    <li> It is very easy to apply, economic (I use 1/3 of the capsule), safe because it is gentle product, and you can reapply in case you want more intense color. I am so happy that I used this product for my brows. I think that this tint respects your own color, it doesn&#x27;t change it just intensifies it.</li>
    <li> The light brown comes out as dark brown, but it works. I have very resistant brows.  The hair isn&#x27;t gray, its snow white (from vitiligo). To get the color to take I do have to leave it on a bit longer or reapply, so that does make it darker, but I&#x27;m delighted that the color holds. I&#x27;ve used traditional dye both at home and the salon and it never lasts more than a few days and the color is muted from the start, not a true brown. This color actually takes and holds. It does fade slightly, but that&#x27;s good in my case are my brows are a light to medium brown. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great eyebrow color.  It lasts for about 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> results not long lasting, but perhaps i&#x27;ll leave it on longer next time. not the same as a professional dye.</li>
    <li> This left my eyebrows looking black not light brown. I left the product on for 1 minute. This is not even in the right tones. All these products appear to be the same and that is just variations of black. It looks hideous with my very blonde hair. There is nothing blond or light brown about this product. I am so angry that so I just had to right a review.</li>
    <li> great product and easy to apply.  worked well and covered grey hairs.</li>
    <li> I like this, and its simple to use. But you can&#x27;t leave it on too long (no more than a minute or two), otherwise it gets the eyebrows way, way too dark, and not at all &amp;#34;light brown&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> blonde eyebrows,  my wife would pencil in her eyebrow stuff on my eyebrows  but that would only last until my next shower . she saw this and now I HAVE EYEBROWS for 4 to 6 weeks .THANK YOU</li>
    <li> I think I remember the box was damaged and the product was not the greatest.&lt;br /&gt;I would not order this product again. There are better ones out there.</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy this product because of the reviews I had read. My hair is naturally brown and my eyebrows look black. The hair of my eyebrows is thick. I did as the instructions said based on my hair color, 4 minutes. As I let the color sit I felt a little tingling feeling, which I assumed meant it was processing as it should. I saw absolutely no change in the color of my eyebrows. This was a complete waste of my money. I can&#x27;t just say it will not work on anyone because it might work on people who have thinner hair. In a couple of weeks I will try to use regular hair dye. I think this will work better but the dye is stronger so you cannot leave it on for as long as you would if you were dying the hair on your head. There are videos on Youtube that show &amp;#34;how to . . .&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to expensive eyebrow treatments.  Easy to use and you can take your time to get the right shade.  I have white hair and don&#x27;t want my brows too dark.  I watched a video online to see how to do it.</li>
    <li> The results are exactly what i wanted. However only last 3 weeks not 4.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to apply and very quick results ( 1 minute!).</li>
    <li> I have red hair and bought the light brown brow tint. wish I had gotten a darker color. Last time I mixed alittle left over black lash dye with it and got a better result. I also left it on five or six min. instead of the 1-2 min. recommended in the instructions. As others have pointed out, I have been able to get 2-3 uses out of one capsule, and I use a makeup brush to apply not the sticks they provide. I will probably purchase this again but in a darker shade.</li>
    <li> As a brunette, I have some gray hairs in my eyebrows that bother me so I tint my already dark eyebrows.  Keeping this light brown on for 3 minutes even makes it too dark for me, as I believe eyebrows should not be as dark as the hair on your head (at least for me).  Otherwise, this works pretty well to cover and lasts until they grow out.  I also bought their lightening formula when I feel I&#x27;ve taken the color too dark - works well to use that one for just about a minute to tone it all down and looks so much better and more natural.</li>
    <li> The product promises the dye will remain for several weeks, yet within three days half of one of my eyebrows returned to the grey I was trying to cover.  The color was darker initially than it appeared it should have been and even though I placed petroleum jelly around the eybrow before applying it, as was recommended in the instructions, the dye still &amp;#34;ran&amp;#34; and I had to sit with a q-tip and constantly wipe it off as it ran so as not to stain my skin around the eyebrows.  Despite this, I still had &amp;#34;stain&amp;#34; on areas of skin around the eyebrows which would not come off,I had to wait several days for it to fade. Also, the product burned the skin under my eyebrow hairs.  I would NOT recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> This order was my second one. I started using this a year ago because it&#x27;s very hard to find a makeup that covers the gray hairs in my eyebrows. This works perfectly and no I don&#x27;t need any kind of makeup! I don&#x27;t have thick eyebrows and use half a capsule per use (about every 6 weeks depending on how much sun I&#x27;ve been in) that way I get 12 uses instead of 6.</li>
    <li> Well, I used this last night for the 1st time.  I have blonde hair and blonde, almost invisible eyebrows.  Now I look like I have a catepillar above each eye.  I will probably try again after this fades away, and leave it on for only 1 minute.  I left it on for almost 2 minutes last night.  At least it is not a tattoo-not permanent, and will start to fade soon.</li>
    <li> Love the results but it fades faster than expected. I have to use it every couple of weeks but it is worth it to cover the grey.</li>
    <li> My purpose for buying the product was to cover the gray in my eyebrows.  Gray accounts for about 30% of my eyebrows now. My hairdresser does this for me usually, but I go every 6 weeks and would like it done more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all I think it&#x27;s difficult for anyone who is farsighted to apply this product.  I really struggled to get it on the hairs but not the skin.  Second - the timing is just wrong.  I left it on 5 min, removed, the gray was not covered.  I re-applied, left it on for 10 min, still didn&#x27;t work.  So I next left it on for 25 min, it worked but was darker than I would like.  Also, about 10 days later I could see the gray again.  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may try a light brown, and leave it on longer and see if it stays longer, but overall, not worth the money if it lasts 10 days.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product for about 2 years now.  At first I loved it.  But the last two or three times I have bought it was not up to the par performance I am used to.  It seems that the color doesn&#x27;t last as long as it did when I first purchased it.  Before I could go 3-4 weeks before dying my eyebrows again and now it&#x27;s like every week and a half.</li>
    <li> Ordered because I routinely get my eyebrows dyed at the salon.  This works as described and is easy to do as part of morning routine - meaning it only takes a few minutes and is hard to get wrong.  I did not use the entire capsule - I followed the suggestion to cut it in half and I had more than enough.  I ordered the light brown as I have dark blonde hair and I wish I had ordered the medium brown.  The light worked fine and I left it on long but, it is slightly lighter than I am used to.  The reviews stating it was very dark - not my experience.  I will purchase again and have recommended to others.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff because it has a very smooth and spreadable consistency which makes it very easy to shape and work with. I have white (blonde) eyebrows and have to be very careful because this stuff sets very quickly compared to my old brand. 2 mins is long enough! It does stain your skin for a day so don&#x27;t do it before you have to go out!</li>
    <li> This product works as described however, I remain disappointed in their color availability. I would assume that in their line this &amp;#34;light brown&amp;#34; would be fit for blondes yet it is way too dark. If you are in need of a lighter color, you will have to use this very, very sparingly and leave it on briefly or you will end up with a Groucho Marx brow- it is that dark though it is called &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; brown. That said it is a good product and a blonde can work with it if you want a tinted brow when you&#x27;re not wearing makeup. I put this on so lightly that when I go out I will still use a pencil to get more definition- I just use a more suitable color and blend. Hope that helps. And if you&#x27;ve never tried this type of brow dye before I STRONGLY recommend you do not dye your brows within 3 days of a special event. The first time I (and others) tried this it took 3 days to be presentable!</li>
    <li> I shouldn&#x27;t get so excited when a product does exactly what it says it will... but it did and I am.  I followed the instructions exactly, and my blonde eyebrows are now light brown.  I&#x27;m having to re-apply every 10 days to 2 weeks.  The color capsule is a bit awkward to take apart, but it&#x27;s possible even on the first try.  I&#x27;m going to re-order so that I&#x27;ll have more on hand.  It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> I have yet to find an eyebrow color that calls itself light brown and actually winds up light brown. As I have grey eyebrows, in order for the dye to work, I have to keep the color on longer and always wind up with dark brown to black eyebrows. That includes this brand.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 2 years to dye stray gray hairs in my brows.  It works great!  I did find the dark brown to be too dark.  Light brown works well but I did learn something the hard way.  I use just a fraction of the dye from the capsule for each tinting session as many have suggested (and the box lasts about a year!).  YOU MUST USE EQUAL PARTS DEVELOPER AND DYE OR IT WILL BE DARKER.  I try to err on the side of caution and use a tad more developer than dye.  I have also found that to dye thick, stubborn gray hairs it takes a bit more time than it says.  I just take it off after about 3 minutes and re-apply if needed.  Sometimes I will do a \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; and just go after the few grays and it takes no time at all.  I like the idea of applying with an old mascara wand and plan on giving that a try.</li>
    <li> Not a girly girl but after first time was really easy. Also don&#x27;t have to use full capsule so last longer than expected. But only down side is it goes on darker than expected.</li>
    <li> I found this product easy to use.  I left the product on for thirty seconds, wiped it off, and re applied it so it was not too dark. It has been the best way not to end up with way too dark eyebrows for a blondie.</li>
    <li> I bought this product along with the Godefroy eyebrow tattoos. Although the product is easy to apply, I found the product too light for my dark brunette brows so I still need to use an eye pencil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Godefroy instant eyebrow tint for over a year, and I love it. That said, DON&#x27;T FOLLOW THE ENCLOSED INSTRUCTIONS. Here are best practices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have blonde hair and very blonde, but thick, eyebrows. I use the light brown tint and have discovered that leaving it on too long makes me look like a jerk (i.e., Groucho Marx, as some other pople have noted). Instead of trusting to 20 seconds or 30 seconds, though, it works best to apply and remove the tint several times over the course of the dying session, letting it set for only 5-10 seconds at a time. Considering that it takes time to apply it -- sometimes more, sometimes less -- means that a 30 second tint time might mean disaster. Also, this approach lets you identify areas you&#x27;ve missed (like the corners) and catch them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother with covering your skin with vaseline. You can remove any dye on your skin in enough time to keep it from staining. Seriously, don&#x27;t panic -- you&#x27;ve got time to finish the application, pick up a swab, and wipe off excess splatter without leaving any discoloration. This also ensures that vaseline won&#x27;t accidentally get into your brows and keep the dye from fixing in those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do start with a quick cleaning of the area with soap and water. Towel dry, then get everything ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use an entire capsule of dye. In fact, do what I&#x27;ve done and find yourself a small, cylindrical container with a screw cap (like they sell at co-op markets for DIY lip balm). Carefully open all the capsules by tapping the dye to the bottom and cutting off the top of the capsule with sharp scissors. Then empty all of the capsules into your container. It&#x27;s important to use one with a screw cap because if there&#x27;s any friction in the cap &amp; container, pulling it off will spill the powdered dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can take a tiny amount of the dye -- I have a 1/8 tsp metal spoon and get less than half that amount -- and put it in the plastic cup. Then addan approximately equal amount of developer, and mix it with the enclosed stick. (Honestly, even with this amount I end up discarding about half.) DON&#x27;T use the sticks to apply the dye. Pick up a pack of disposable Dentex brushes -- they work great, and a pack will last forever. Roll the brush in the dye, making sure it&#x27;s saturated and that there are no clumps. Then apply that to your brows, starting by working in the direction of hair growth. Keep a damp swab handy to wipe off any overspray on your skin. Leave the color on for just a few seconds, then wipe off with damp tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working this way, you can then do another pass opposite the direction of hair growth, pulling the brows down from the top. Then another aimed at just the edges. Go from one brow to the other. You won&#x27;t end up with frighteningly different eyebrows, since you&#x27;re leaving it on for such a short time. Work in good light. Don&#x27;t forget the innermost parts where the hair basically grows straight up, or your eyebrows will look too far apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the reviews I read before trying this frightened me, because they stressed exact waiting times and ensuring exactly the same treatment of both brows, which is impossible. Be light-handed, clean up after yourself, and scrutinize between applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the dye job doesn&#x27;t last for six weeks -- that&#x27;s nuts, especially if your hair grows fast and/or you wash your face or shower, like, ever. (maybe they mean the package will last for six weeks? Again, nuts, because if you use only the amount of dye you need for two reasonable eyebrows, it&#x27;ll last for months.) The good news is that it takes less than 10 minutes to re-dye, so you can touch up as often as needed.</li>
