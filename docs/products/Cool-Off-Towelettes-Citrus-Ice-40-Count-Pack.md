<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These really work, I wish however I could still get the ones that were actually washcloths.&lt;br /&gt;I have been very ill and get severe sweats when the pain is bad. These work for that, hot flashed, living in a hot climate like FL&lt;br /&gt;Any menopausal women will LOVE these.</li>
    <li> I get instant relief with these little packets that unfold into frosty, hanky-size towelettes. I use them on my forehead and neck to bring down my temp while wiping away sweat. I carry a half dozed or so in my purse at all times so I can respond quickly when the furnace in my body clicks on and the heat starts to radiate.</li>
    <li> All the ladies in the family tried this out as we sat in a restaurant waiting.  We had come from the outside which was fairly hot and just couldn&#x27;t cool down.  I passed these around, even to Grandpa.... and they worked really well.  No telling what&#x27;s in them.  Could be something so simple as alcohol... but these are great for throwing in your purse and the vehicle glove box for emergencies.  I wouldn&#x27;t say they lasted for ever... but they did cool us all down.  I&#x27;m never going to be w/o them again.</li>
    <li> Very helpful when you have a hot flash.  Really does make you feel cooler.</li>
    <li> My granddaughters tennis matches and field hockey games were in brutal heat this summer. These towelettes kept them a lot more comfortable.  I also sent them to my  friends who love to go to &amp;#34;u-pick&amp;#34; vegetable farms.</li>
    <li> BEST COOLING PRODUCT EVER MADE!!</li>
    <li> I won a box of these from Sue&#x27;s Review blog at the perfect time; I was on medication that had the side effect of atrocious hot flashes, plus I had to get on a plane and the enclosed space always gets me overheated even without medication.&lt;br /&gt;These were a God-send; the cooling sensation lasts and helped me through some really rough patches (along with a dollar store mini fan).  I don&#x27;t love the smell, not bad, but not great, so my true rating would be 4.5 Stars.&lt;br /&gt;They are also great for freshening up after physical therapy (no showers, but I managed a wash up at the sink).&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend them and will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Just wish the coolness lasted longer, only briefly cools. Feels great but I am back to being hot/sweaty within 10 minutes</li>
    <li> These are the best ! ! It&#x27;s hard to be conversant when you&#x27;re steaming like a baked potato, and these take that edge off.</li>
    <li> Wish I had these a long time ago! Sure does wonders especially with hyperhydrosis! I sweat so much all the time! These are a life saver!</li>
    <li> When I began experiencing hot flashes (i.e., bursting into flame every 45 minutes, I tried all the cooling lotions and rollers and every other product that offered any kind of help, and NONE of them worked, not even a little. These little towelettes actually helped a great deal, and the cooling sensation lasted a half an hour or so, which was AWESOME. I eventually gave up after a year and went on hormone replacement therapy, which I have never regretted, but I still use these, particularly for travel, and on hot weather hikes for a quick refreshing cooldown. They are excellent, and I recommend them to everyone I know who is not a fan of hot weather. LOVE THEM!!!</li>
    <li> Portable, convenient and the best product I&#x27;ve found to immediately help you cool down. Most &#x27;cooling&#x27; products can&#x27;t be used when you are dressed for business or aren&#x27;t wearing shorts/work-out clothes.  This was simply the best as we traveled throughout southern Europe.</li>
    <li> Great! Hope the maker continues to produce this.</li>
    <li> These are great for my MS caused heat intolerance. They aren&#x27;t a miracle, but do make summer much more bearable.</li>
    <li> Hmmm...with all the positive reviews I thought this would be spot on.  I does cool when you use it, but fades quickly. That wouldn&#x27;t be so bad, but the scent is just so strong and an almost bug repellent scent that at work this wouldn&#x27;t be acceptable. The scent listed is Citrus Ice...I can detect slight citrus in there among other herb scents making it more repellent than citrus. I will use them for weekends I guess. If they had a more acceptable scent would be wonderful, just too strange of a scent to pass for anything &#x27;normal&#x27; that you would use during the day in public.  I&#x27;m not one bothered by scents, I make homemade soaps and work with scents almost daily, but this is just strong.</li>
    <li> Excellent little wipes. Bring on the chill! These combined with a cool towel keeps the chill going!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 3 char</li>
    <li> Why didn&#x27;t someone say it&#x27;s just Ben Gay in a towelette! My neck is on fire, no cooling! I stink, I&#x27;m burning EVERYWHERE I used this stupid product, should&#x27;ve known too good to be true or WORK!</li>
    <li> Cool Off towelettes are my new best friend!  Definitely works to take the edge off of a hot flash and I&#x27;m looking forward to plain old summer heat and humidity relief.  I only caution to NOT put one on your face/near your eyes.</li>
    <li> Sticky and bad smell.</li>
    <li> like rubbing bengay or icy hot on.  It seemed like a good buy at the time, and it would have been amazing if they worked</li>
    <li> These towelettes are great to carry in your purse and will cool you off quickly on a hot and humid day.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any real difference.  Keeps you cool for a second!  I was disappointed.  I am in full menopause, so maybe just not the product for me.  Felt nice though for the second it lasted!</li>
    <li> Works great for hot days! Good product!</li>
    <li> The only problem i have with this towel is the smell and not sure why they put arnica in it as it is known for pain relief, and i have read you have to be very careful with this herb, so i&#x27;m hoping it is in a very small amount...I also had to use it at work a couple of times, and everybody thought i had  Bengay on...i know menthol is hard to camouflage, but hope they can correct this somehow. The ingredients are: Witch Hazel Extract, Alcohol, Flaxseed, Evening Primrose, Wild Yam, Tea Tree, Black Cohosh Root, to name a few, even St. John&#x27;sWort, (definitely sounds like it was designed for menopause)  so if you are allergic to any of these use with caution. I just wonder if any of these really get into the system as the skin is really hard to penetrate.</li>
    <li> For a fraction of the cost, I would recommend any facial or body wipe. These COOL OFF&#x27;s are the same to me, except they are overly infused with herbs and not sure what else. I was looking for something, anything, that would help with hot flashes. Well, this works in that anything wet will cool you down when you are in overheating mode.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried one was in the company of my daughter and her family. I discreetly pulled one from the packet as we were sitting in the family room. I was not prepared for the smell. All I can say is that the room quickly cleared and it was a good 20 minutes before we could return and breathe comfortably. I ran to the bathroom to soap down my arms and try to remove the intense odour. it is very strong and it lingers. I did try one again a day later, in case that first one was stale dated. Equally offensive. If I amortize the 2 towelettes, that would amount to the grand sum of $9.00+ each!</li>
    <li> OMG  These are amazing.  I could not wait to try.  I was amazed and cannot wait to order more as I will never be without again.  I had my husband try as he works in heat all day in a machine shop.  He loved it too and asked to take a couple to work!  Hot flashes, after tanning and anytime just to freshen- Love this. Came quickly and packaged well but... bag did look old &amp; faded, but product worked well.</li>
    <li> These things are  da-bomb!  You can cool off any time, any where. Just wipe down your neck, cheeks, the underside of your wrists, cleavage if you have it, and behind your knees, and you are refreshed , cool and comfortable for several hours. I gave one to a good friend at her wedding reception in July, and it saved the day.</li>
    <li> I love these.  Living in South Georgia the summers are very hot.  These are nice to take with me on a walk or to the beach.</li>
    <li> Very effective for temporary immediate cooling, especially during hot flashes.  Temporary because the effect does lessen after about 15 minutes.  The cooling is so welcome, and the skin wipe is soft to the touch, but it dries up fast.  The after-effect cooling is best if air circulates around you.  Enough to let me get back in bed and try to sleep before the next flash hits.  My skin stays cool just long enough!  Then repeat, and repeat.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I survived before finding &amp;#34;Cool Off Towelettes&amp;#34;!  They are wonderful and I&#x27;m always passing them out to others.</li>
    <li> I get so overheated and sweaty sometimes, like when I&#x27;m cooking a big meal, etc., and I was hoping these would really help.  I gave them a 3 because they do work...at least somewhat.  They did make my skin feel kind of tingly and slightly cooler, but did not stop the sweating (which I&#x27;m not sure the product is even supposed to do that, to be fair).  I&#x27;m not a big fan of the scent.  It does have a citrus smell to it, but there is also a slight chemical smell that goes along with it.</li>
    <li> These things are the BEST!!  I was in the heat of Israel, oh so hot, and my sister handed me one of these and told me how to use it - amazing.  I cooled down immediately. Love these!</li>
    <li> These are convenient little individual packs with one cooling cloth in each. They are in my car, my purse, my nightstand and my suitcases! They actually lower your body temp by 15%. I&#x27;ve been buying these since the first time I tried one 4 years ago. Now, I order 50 at a time. They have a little bit of a menthol like scent, but it goes away after you wipe off with it. It doesn&#x27;t linger, like some sports creams do. Your skin feels and stays feeling cool for awhile. I highly recommend to any women with hot flashes. And to anyone who wants a quick cool off after exercising or playing sports. I LOVE THEM!!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the wipes.Found them to be very  refreshing and helpful in  wiping away perspiration.  It does not stop u from perspiring but will cool you off for a time. ........only wish they were a bit larger....to cover more area.&lt;br /&gt;Claire T</li>
    <li> These really work!  Sent some to family in TX and it was very effective.  Have to remember not to get close to eyes.</li>
    <li> As a voluptuous woman nearing menopause, I simply can not stand the Texas summer heat. And it is truly embarrassing to be dripping sweat all over the place. These help to cool things down a bit but I do wish that they worked longer</li>
    <li> I was very excited to find a naturopathic means to cool off during the Texas summer while riding motorcycles and/or for the football team. Unfortunately, wherever the wipe was used it would immediately burn and turn extremely red. At times, lasting a day or more and, for myself, small blisters.</li>
    <li> This product is great if you get overheated and need a quick cool down. I use them on the golf course, while mowing and anytime I am outdoors and get hot. I am very fair skinned and tend to overheat quickly, but I love being outside and using this product allows me to spend more time outdoors. They are refreshing and easy to keep on hand in a pocket or purse. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a way to cool down when outdoors during hot summers like we have in Texas.</li>
    <li> I have recently started having severe hot flashes that are driving me nuts!!!! I get clammy and start sweating for no reason whatsoever. No it&#x27;s not menopause ladies, only logical reason, it is probably caused by some recent health problems. Anyway, it&#x27;s pretty embarrassing to say the least, so I thought after reading several reviews, I found the product I needed to help with this. Well, let me warn you all, if you use this on your neck, your  eyes will begin to burn from the menthol that is in them. So because of that, I can only use them on my arms, and because that is NOT going to help me stop sweating, these were a big waste of money for me. I don&#x27;t know, maybe my eyes are sensitive, but these are terrible. In all fairness, when I did use them on my neck, they do give a cooling sensation, but not enough for me to suffer with burning eyes. Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money!</li>
    <li> I live in Texas and during the summer we have many 100º+  days. If I spend any time outside Cool Off&#x27;s wipes bring a refreshing cool feel to my skin.  I garden and take my dogs out all the time and I keep these with me.  Love them.</li>
    <li> Helped cool me off quickly. I&#x27;m looking forward to it helping keep me cool during the summer hot hot weather.</li>
    <li> Cool Offs are a must in the summer heat.  Keep them in your purse so you are always prepared.  They save the day at Little League games, soccer games, cookouts, and other outdoor activities.</li>
    <li> Absolute life saver during pre-menopausal symptoms.  I carry them in my purse at all times, and they really help when the hot flashes hit.  The smell is a little strong and menthol-y, but i don&#x27;t mind it.  Learned the hard way to keep it off face and away from eyes, but when you use it as directed (duh, my bad) it is effective and fantastic.  I&#x27;ve recommended to several of my female friends of a certain age, and all have agreed, this is the best.</li>
    <li> These things are the best thing ever. I was having trouble overheating due to some medications I was on, these were so nice to have in my purse for a much needed cool down. I&#x27;ve re-ordered them, and that is always a good testament to whether a product works.</li>
    <li> The instantaneos chill takes one completely by surprise. The smell is an added bonus...will probably buy some more. One is cooled enough for an average of 15 minutes. Not bad for the bucks spent</li>
    <li> Fabulous!  Refreshes immediately, and lasts a long time.  I have shared them with others, who plan to make a purchase as well.</li>
    <li> I gave these out to friends at a festival. They burned like crazy!!! We all had a good laugh at my expense and a bit of fun giving them to friends just to watch their reaction to the burning. Good times...&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend unless you like that kind of thing...</li>
    <li> great product .cools you off immediately I use after a line dance class I would definitely recommend this product.. I will be buying some more.</li>
    <li> I am now one cool lady!  I am carrying Cool Offs in my purse and handing them out like candy to my menopausal friends!  Hot flashes can be controlled with the use of a Cool Off. This is a great product and I won&#x27;t ever be without one within my reach.</li>
    <li> I tried the Cool Off Towelettes and ...they work...&lt;br /&gt;A friend told me about them and 5 minures later I got on line and ordered them.&lt;br /&gt;Just gave half the order to my sister(who also suffers from a dripping face and neck) and she is excited!&lt;br /&gt;I will order them again before I run out!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I would have survived my first week in S. Korea without these cool-off towelettes!  They helped save my sanity!</li>
    <li> amazing, cool immediately lasts for over half an hour in an industrial environment, keep buying. totally recommended</li>
    <li> Received item fast! These towelettes are great when you need your body to cool down!</li>
    <li> helps me stay cool! this is really a great product and has helped out a lot during this hot summer and my &#x27;hot&#x27; problem!</li>
