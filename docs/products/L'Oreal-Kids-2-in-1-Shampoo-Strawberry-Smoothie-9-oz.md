<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Clean well and smells good. Kids love it.</li>
    <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal Kids and have for more than 75% of my waking life (I&#x27;m 23). I love this new bottle design. It came in the same box as a book and a DVD but not to worry--the packaging was great, and the shampoo never left the bottle! The scent is great and I love wig-wig-wigglin my butt in the shower with my new friend. Great buy! I can&#x27;t recommend enough. One of the awesomest things I&#x27;ve ever bought on Amazon, literally.</li>
    <li> It just dries the hair out on both of my girls ... It&#x27;s inexpensive and smells nice, but we stopped using it because it caused too many snarls in there hair.</li>
    <li> My 4 yr old daughter loves the smell and no tears when the suds get in her eyes so it&#x27;s a big win at bath time.</li>
    <li> smells good, but does nothing for conditioning my 4 year old&#x27;s hair. She has very thick, medium length hair that is always knotty. I think this dried out her scalp and I still used an extra conditioner after this to get her hair soft and manageable. Already tried J&amp;J blue 2 in 1 for thick/curly hair and it is much better with getting rid of tangles and knots!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this shampoo. It gets her hair clean and smells great. She has short curly hair. It doesn&#x27;t tame it but it helps.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it. Smells amazing. will be getting another one when the time comes.</li>
    <li> My son loves the smell of this shampoo but I&#x27;m not sure if it makes his hair soft.  It does not burn his eyes and he loves to wash his hair.</li>
    <li> I smell nice and creamy.</li>
    <li> Only haircare product I wil use on my kids heads. They have I believe all flavors/smells so we can make our own, or change things up a bit. Bottle is perfect size &amp; know it&#x27;s &amp;#34;theirs&amp;#34;!  Thank you</li>
    <li> This has been an excellent shampoo for our little girls. One has very fine thin hair and this shampoo works really well for her. The others have thicker coarser hair and the shampoo does great for them, too. It smells nice and they like it. It makes their hair squeaky clean and shiny. We have been pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Truly amazed at how well this works detangling long hair. The smell is a bit strong but the brush goes right through after bath time. Works better than the expensive stuff we&#x27;ve tried like aveeno and organix.</li>
    <li> Super product for my little great granddaughter...works well and smells deeeelicious!!!</li>
    <li> smell good , my kid like it</li>
    <li> I know that it&#x27;s for kids, but the smell is way too strong and tacky.</li>
    <li> Great product leaves my toddlers with soft hair and smells great!</li>
    <li> my daughter is 20 months old and is biracial. Her hair is starting to get long and I need something a little thicker to soften her hair up to make it easier to comb. This product is just ok. It would be great on Caucasian hair, but not so much on biracial curly hair. It definitely smells great though.</li>
    <li> As my 7 year-old daughter said, it smells like bottom. It has strong fake strawberry scent and that somehow makes this shampoo smell like bottom I think.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the other kind of same product, and it was okay.</li>
    <li> for me , this is better than Johnson &amp; Johnson , I love the smell and immediately my daughter&#x27;s hair is soft and manageable . I have this on reship because I don&#x27;t ever want to run out! I even used it on my hair and got the same results! I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I always buy this for my toddler, she loves it!</li>
    <li> Smells great and leaves my daughters hair soft.</li>
    <li> My parents keep buying us this brand BECAUSE it says Tear Free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tell my preschooler (4 years old) that as she is screaming that her eyes are burning and she is trying to get out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a parent it breaks my heart to cause my child pain and make something like washing her hair a traumatic (to the child it seems traumatic) experience.  She used to love taking showers until we have encountered advertisement of tear free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, as a parent felt like I should try it out.  I did exactly as my 4 year old would do.  It did sting.  I am really disappointed.  It seems like I am stuck again using something that is a shampoo for body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They smell great though.</li>
    <li> Not good for tangles.</li>
    <li> Smells really nice and not harsh. Even though it&#x27;s a 2 in 1 for my daughter&#x27;s hair I also use the conditioner from L&#x27;oreal Kids as it&#x27;s not enough as she has thick hair.  But for normal to thin hair I think you would be able to forgo the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love the scent and it does a great job on my girls&#x27; hair!  I would buy this again and again.</li>
    <li> I know a lot of people who use this shampoo. Even a few celebrities like Ariana Grande. It&#x27;s great for all hair types. It keeps my hair smooth and silky and it smells amazing. I definitely suggest it.</li>
    <li> Smells like strawberry bubblegum. Lathers well, 3 yr old daughter loves to smell it and wash witg it after her bath she&#x27;ll sit sniffing her arms and hair for an hour. My daughter lovesto help in the garden and sometimes that means sand and dirt  in her hair makong her blonde hair brown and this wahes it right out without dryingout her skin or scalp. She did get it in her eyes and mouth when rinsing her hair and it didn&#x27;t bother her much, but she was spitting for a couple mintutes trying to get rid of the taste. Lol</li>
    <li> My seven-year-old has fine hair and I found that regular shampoo had a harsh effect on her hair. After reading several reviews of the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Kids hair care products, I decided to purchase the shampoo, conditioner, and swim shampoo. The results have been wonderful thus far. My daughter loves the smell and the cute containers, and the shampoo has been wonderful for everyday use as it does not dry her hair out. I&#x27;m even using it myself. I just wish the range came in larger containers.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, love the price. The kids request it during bath time and it&#x27;s now in the subscribe and save lineup.</li>
    <li> This just smells yummy and even after my little one is out of the tub I can sniff his hair and smell it.  No tears when it gets in his eyes.</li>
    <li> I had been purchasing Suave Smoothers 2-in-1 shampoo as part of a subscribe and save subscription, but Suave was dropped from the program.  I decided to try this one instead.  My wife and daughter don&#x27;t like it nearly as much, though, so we&#x27;re going back to Suave.  My wife says it is doesn&#x27;t seem to clean as well as the Suave.</li>
    <li> I like the different fragrances this product offers, but it is just not as lathering a shampoo compared to other kid&#x27;s shampoos we&#x27;ve tried. I tend to use alot of it on my daughter&#x27;s thick hair.</li>
    <li> Great smell! But it&#x27;s much cheaper to just go purchase at Kmart. But if you can&#x27;t buy it in stores, smell alone is worth the price(:</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok just not as conditioning as id expect a 2 in 1</li>
    <li> Smells great. My girls love it and love to get hair washed</li>
    <li> i thought it would be fun and tear free shampoo for kids but the smeell is very strong just like the old strawberry smoothie.Cannot tolerate the smell so had to throw it away because i dont want to vomit bcoz of this smell</li>
    <li> Smells delicious! My daughter loves to use it because it is pink and smells like strawberry candy.</li>
    <li> This smells so yummy.  My little one loves it and is happy to use it! We&#x27;re happy because it actually conditions.</li>
    <li> We use this on my 4 year old. It has a really nice smell and helps keep tangles away.</li>
    <li> Very  very  very  goooooood</li>
    <li> My daughters skin broke out with a red itchy rash the first time we used it in her bath. My husband was so mad he threw it away!!! (Would have preferred to return but oh well!).</li>
    <li> I disliked the smell! It does not smell like a strawberry smoothie! It stinks. It also doesn&#x27;t rinse easily, so I would not recommend it!</li>
    <li> I just love the smell of this shampoo.</li>
    <li> very strong scent and for us that was a draw back</li>
    <li> The smell is fantastic and the shampoo lathers really well.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my kids for about a year now and they always smell so nice!</li>
    <li> I was looking for an alternative to suave kids shampoo for my girls, who swim often and have scraggly hair.  This one smells better and is slightly thicker than Suave and I think it works a bit better.  I still need to use adult conditioner on them afterwards, though.</li>
    <li> Good product, came spilled all over my box.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is pretty good for my daughters long hair. I think the conditioner really helps with detangling but not really moisture, which we need in the summer months because of the pool and beach. We may have to start supplementing another conditioner.</li>
    <li> My 3 year old has very long and thick straight hair but it also gets easily tangled and brushing after shower is a nightmare (she kicks and screams and runs at the sight of me even approaching her with a brush). However, this makes the job easier. It smells great and since it has conditioner in it, it leaves her hair soft and manageable with very little tangles.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it and it smells great!</li>
    <li> Washing my 3-yr old&#x27;s hair had been a challenge until we told her her hair would smell like strawberry. Since, she wants to do it herself. Needless to say, the product itself is good too and makes her hair so soft!</li>
    <li> I got this shampoo because my 5 years old has long hair that tangles easily. The shampoo is good, but I still need to use conditioner after, although is suppose to be 2 in one. Great product for the money, though. I am using it myself and it&#x27;s very good even for colored hair. I used to use very expensive products, and I never found a shampoo I liked 100%.</li>
    <li> Great smell, my daughters love this product and makes bath time so much more enjoyable.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo for both of our kids.  It smells good, doesn&#x27;t sting in the eyes and gets the hair nice and clean!</li>
    <li> now I never have to worry about forgetting it again! thank you Amazon subscribe and save, now I always have it and don&#x27;t need to try to remember to see how low we are getting.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the pleasant smell for this shampoo, no tears. Easy to wash out of hair and makes the hair soft and smooth and smelling clean.</li>
    <li> I have tried a couple of 2 in 1 shampoos for my daughter&#x27;s thin straight blonde hair.  No shampoo and conditioner in one seems to condition it well (or at all) and regular conditioner seems to heavy and greasy for a toddler so this seems to be the perfect medium.  I still need to spray just a little detangler in her hair after towel drying it a bit, but I think I&#x27;ve found the perfect shampoo for her</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this!! My little baby smells so good after bath time. And I love that it doesn&#x27;t irritate his eyes or skin.</li>
    <li> excelent, i love it for children</li>
    <li> Smells yummy - the bottle goes quick thou. The price is right and kids like it.</li>
    <li> My 6yo daughter loves this shampoo because it smells great and only uses one application. I love it for the same reasons. It works as well as stand-alone shampoo and conditioner, but only have to rinse her hair once!</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo for myself and it makes my hair sooooo soft. It smells kind of gross out of the bottle, like sour vomit, but after it lathers up and after your hair dries, it has an artificial strawberry scent! I like it, the smell isn&#x27;t overbearing.</li>
    <li> My kids think that this shampoo smells great! I have it on Subscribe and Save so that it comes once a month and I don&#x27;t have to remember to buy shampoo at the store.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Doesn&#x27;t totally get snarls out but my daughter loves the pink color. Doesn&#x27;t weigh down that fine toddler hair.</li>
    <li> I love that this is tear free and smells delicious!!! It&#x27;s perfect for my daughter&#x27;s hair now that she has graduated from baby shampoo.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo, has a nice smell.</li>
    <li> Washed my 2yr old daughter&#x27;s hair and for the 1st time she didn&#x27;t cry!! She loved the pink packaging and was happy to have the product applied to her hair. It smells lovely too!!</li>
    <li> Smells just like strawberries, good lather and bubbles. You know the hair is clean</li>
    <li> This is the second time I brought this product from Amazon. My daughter&#x27;s long hair is very soft and organized after first time used. Compared with the other brand, this one is better.</li>
    <li> it is effective and make my hair look better. But only one thing that not satisfied me is that the smell is too sweet not like the strawberry.</li>
    <li> smells good, non irritating, works well keeps my granddaughter&#x27;s thin, curly hair manageable.</li>
    <li> For my 6 year old daughter we have been always using suave shampoo and thought of giving L&#x27;Oreal a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;quality of this shampoo is very good and It has a nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter loved her new shampoo.</li>
    <li> This smells great and my kids love it. It works really well on their hair.</li>
    <li> Fabulously smelling, and good price!</li>
    <li> It smells just like a strawberry smoothie. It also left my hair feelings soft. I liked how gentle it was and how easy the bottle was to open. Great for kids and also adults.</li>
    <li> The smell of this is too fake fruity. Almost chemically. Not a big fan unfortunately.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells heavenly and leaves both of my daughters&#x27; hair smelling great, soft, and tangle-free. Very good product. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> The smell is very pleasant and not fake. The scent is also lasting, my son&#x27;s hair still smells good the next day. Be aware that kids may try and eat it, though, because it really smells like a tasty dessert.</li>
    <li> like it! work as a miracle on my daughter&#x27;s hair. She loves the strawberry smell so much which is a plus!</li>
    <li> smells&lt;br /&gt;good&lt;br /&gt;nice for the kids and bubble baths so we like it and its cheap thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;happy new year</li>
    <li> I remember when my mom would use this on my hair as a little girl. It has an amazing scent, and packs a lot of softness for just a little bottle. I used this on my hair, just to see what it&#x27;d do.. And it left my hair smelling so yummy and my hair so soft. It reminded me of my childhood to, which was nice. :)</li>
    <li> Great kids shampoo...Smells good, Works Great, and my daughter loves the bottle.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing, and makes your hair soft. I&#x27;m an adult, and I use with the grape conditioner. It lathers nicely, cleans well, and leaves a light scent on your hair for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years, and definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find a tear free paraben free children&#x27;s shampoo that is not crazy expensive.  THhs one is it!  The added bonus is it smells great too!</li>
    <li> Great; available through the &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save&amp;#34; option for good saving/convenience</li>
    <li> We moved to this shampoo after my girls became too old for Johnson&#x27;s baby shampoo. They love the smell and if it gets in their eyes, they don&#x27;t cry. It leaves their hair soft, but not too soft (my girls have thin, fine blonde hair) and it is a favorite!</li>
    <li> Smells nice and my young ones do not complain.</li>
    <li> this stuff smells wonderful and the kids love it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this back in August and it is now December and Never got it. I was so busy that it never crossed my mind until I went to check on some things and realized that this product never showed up :(</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the strawberry smell, and it&#x27;s so convenient to not have to do shampoo and conditioner separately.  It sometimes irritates her eyes, but overall is great.</li>
    <li> Its okay, I would of loved for it to be better, but it is not a bad shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;its fine.</li>
    <li> The smell is great and cleans my toddlers hair well. She gets excited when I use it, goes &amp;#34;mmmm&amp;#34; after smelling the cap and gets excited. Cleans well too, I would recommend this product for the price it is offered on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Good Shampoo for kids</li>
    <li> Daughter loves this one. Great smell.</li>
    <li> It smells AMAZING. My little smells like a walking smoothie lol</li>
    <li> Kids love the scent, leaves hair untangled and soft</li>
    <li> Not a fan of the scent.</li>
    <li> Every day product for my kids, love the smell!</li>
    <li> My 5 and 6 year old kids love washing their hair with this. This smells so delicious that they are always wanting to wash their hair.&lt;br /&gt;Great price as well! I subscribe and save to this and get an additional 15% off. I have not doubt as to why this is the number 1 seller!</li>
    <li> Both of my girls broke out in a rash on their neck and shoulders from using this product. Granted, we are all of the &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; variety, but I expected more from a product made especially for kids.</li>
    <li> Smells great and my daughter&#x27;s hair isn&#x27;t tangly after!</li>
    <li> Smells good and untangles hair great!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my younger children. I like the smell of it and so do my daughters but it doesn&#x27;t work up a good lather like other shampoos. It does leave their hair really soft though.</li>
    <li> I wish there was more product for the price. Smells good and it is a cute design.</li>
