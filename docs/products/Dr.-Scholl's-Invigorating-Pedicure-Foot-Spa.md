<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it is good at this price</li>
    <li> Loveee this foot messaging bath...it feels great on the feet with messaging bubbles and vibration.  I use after a hard day work....Greatttt</li>
    <li> Lots of bubble action and the foot massage roller built it is a bonus, but it doesn&#x27;t keep hot water hot very very long. It says it doesn&#x27;t heat the water but will maintain hot water that is added, however, we found it doesn&#x27;t keep the hot water hot. It very shortly gets cold. We decided to keep it since it does bubble a lot and feet do feel better afterward. We also like that it includes the foot foot massage roller and foot pumice Stone to soften heels and Pedicure Set.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best purchases we have made as a &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; for us in a while. It works great. We use it almost once a week, we&#x27;re runners and it feels great after long training runs.</li>
    <li> Very Loud. Don&#x27;t plan on watching TV while using the footbath. Other than that it is great.</li>
    <li> I had a thick big toenail removed due to an infection.  I need to do my own pedicures now.  I like this foot spa as there is room to soak and it is sturdy when using the center piece to work on one foot at a time.  The toe rests at front are nice for letting my legs dry (I don&#x27;t polish my toes).  I do plug it in for the electrical warmer and the warm water I poured it stayed warm.  I only soak my feet for about 10 - 15 minutes, so I don&#x27;t know if the electrical warmer would keep it warm for an hour or so.</li>
    <li> Works mostly as described. Keeps water very warm, but bubble and splashing cool it down very quickly.</li>
    <li> It cannot keep temperature of hot water and water become cool very soon, so the effect is not ideal.</li>
    <li> baubles not strong enough, but it relaxes them feet.</li>
    <li> Do I need to write anymore?</li>
    <li> Was not as great as I had hoped.  I think Conair probably has a nicer one.</li>
    <li> Does not keep water warm.</li>
    <li> It was a horrible device. Stopped working after initial use</li>
    <li> Would buy again.  This product is reasonably priced and does what I expected it to do.  It will NOT keep water at a hot temperature for prolonged periods of time, but it will keep it reasonably hot/warm for 15-20 minutes if you keep it turned on.  If using on a hard surface, you&#x27;ll probably want to put a towel under it because the vibration makes it move around on the floor a bit if you don&#x27;t have your feet in it to hold it down.  Most of the &amp;#34;attachments&amp;#34; are fairly useless except for the pumice stone, so keep that in mind if that is important to you.  I use it to soak my feet in various bath salts and, for that, this product works as well as can be expected.</li>
    <li> I am a steelworker on 12 hour shifts, 60 hours a week, in steel toed boots. My feet were a constant source of pain. All I did was add hot water, a little bit of Epsom salts, and relaxed. This is the best my feet have felt in years!!!! Loved it so much I ordered one for my niece who is a pediatric nurse.</li>
    <li> I took it back ASAP! It was loud and was not comforting to my wife!</li>
    <li> Meets the description, does the job, and my size 12 feet fit in it just fine! You do need to put in warm water initially. Then it keeps the water sufficiently warm.</li>
    <li> Nice but it doesn&#x27;t stay warm at all. It&#x27;s roomy and the jets work. I just keep hot water near by and warm it up myself. It has nice features also like a pumice stone in the center that&#x27;s removable. Great for the price</li>
    <li> Good product used as a portable spa for pedicures.We only use the item as a back upt a great product.</li>
    <li> Nice but would have been awesome if there was a option to heat the water.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too shallow and too small. It&#x27;s basically for your sole only and the water level can not even reach the bottom of you an ankle ball. For athletes who want to give a nice bath for your feet and ankles there is no way to do that. A $5 rubber-maid container will do the work.  If you have wide foot then forget about this. Your feet will fell like carrot before it&#x27;s pulled out of the soil, no movement at all. I turned on the massage and then the bottom turned too hot for feet to stay there.</li>
    <li> I was excited when i ordered this item.....and severely disappointed when i received it. The item i received was a Dr. Scholl&#x27;s foot spa, however it was not the one pictured, its a different model, and a &amp;#34;for her&amp;#34; style. I wasn&#x27;t upset that it wasn&#x27;t the exact one pictured, it actually looked to be a newer model, however there were a few design flaws that make it so it doesn&#x27;t work for the purpose I needed it for. I will be returning this for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;~ not deep enough to cover the top of the foot, ankles, etc&lt;br /&gt;~ no way to have heat without vibration (i don&#x27;t always want/need the vibration)&lt;br /&gt;~ no bubbles (as pictured on the box)&lt;br /&gt;~ no jelly bath included (as listed in the description)&lt;br /&gt;~ no nail brush (as pictured)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;~ lightweight&lt;br /&gt;~ nice pour out design, and nice toe foot rest&lt;br /&gt;~ massage roller, and &amp;#34;acupuncture&amp;#34; attachments&lt;br /&gt;~ relatively quiet&lt;br /&gt;~ toe touch controls, no bending over to turn on/off</li>
    <li> as you would expect. Seems well enough made for the price.</li>
    <li> Bought and returned this. Did NOT heat the water or maintain it. The container just vibrated a little bit; no bubbles. No water action. I wanted similar to my tub&#x27;s whirlpool action. This did not do as advertised. A shame!</li>
    <li> Just save yourself the money and stick your feet in a bowl of warm water. This does nothing except make bubbles really loudly. Does not keep the water warm.</li>
    <li> Never used a foot spa or anything before so I have nothing to compare it to. Filled with very warm water and the thing blew bubbles on the bottom of my feet. They say don&#x27;t run any longer then 20 minutes so the unit doesn&#x27;t overheat. I wonder if this is the real reason or if this is what they are calling &amp;#34;smart heat&amp;#34;. Start with rather warm water, much more then 20 minutes it is going start getting cool. And to add to my 1 star rating I paid $5.00 more for it 3 days ago.</li>
    <li> Mini spa at your home. It&#x27;s exactly how they describe it with the exception that you spill water everywhere. Try to be carefull with that</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s okay for home and ladies foot, but to weak for men&#x27;s foot</li>
    <li> Very nice and comfortable I wish there was a heater in it that would keep the water hot. But otherwise it worked as expected.</li>
    <li> The water doesn&#x27;t stay warm, and cools off very quickly.</li>
    <li> very good &amp; works great.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, exactly what I was looking for. The water stays hot for about 20-30 minutes with the bubbles on (and you&#x27;re NOT going to get ANY foot bath that keeps it hotter for longer than that -- the bubbles are pulling in cooler air!) which is plenty of time to ease my aching feet. The foot roller in the center is a godsend. My only complaint is that the bumps on the bottom aren&#x27;t smooth enough, and it&#x27;s a little painful when I press my feet down too much or move them around. So they&#x27;re not very good for a massage. The foot roller serves that purpose, though, so no harm done in the end. It gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving this 3 stars because it does a terrible job at keeping the water warm. I&#x27;ve basically had to put scolding hot water in it in order to have a warm soak. The jets work great. There&#x27;s been a few occasions where I&#x27;ll turn it on and it runs for a few seconds but then just turns off. I have to wait about 5 minutes before it will turn on again. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d recommend to a friend but at the price I was not expecting professional grade</li>
    <li> The base takes a bit of getting used to as its covered in sharp-ish nodules, but after a while, its rather nice!</li>
    <li> Doesnt heat the water up and super loud. disappointed</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for husband.</li>
    <li> It is just what I expected and does what I need it to do.</li>
    <li> Do what it said but I would shell out the extra money for better ones.</li>
    <li> Doesnt keep water warm at all</li>
    <li> This tub is great. Does the job, great value. It doesn&#x27;t keep the water warm, but if you put warm water in initially it does stay warm for some time.</li>
    <li> I love this I work in a pharmacy standing all day. Make sure you only have the water to the level line ( that is why the MFG. puts the line where it is ) I place it on the floor &amp; away it goes soothing my feet. My callouses are also getting better &amp; my feet are not as dry as before. I highly recommend this foot spa.</li>
    <li> Yes, people the water does eventually cool down. That&#x27;s because your air is normally cooler than the water you put in the footbath and when you turn on the bubbles, cold air circulates through the water, therefore cooling the water down. Chillax and add a little more warm water and enjoy a nice soak after a long day at work. It&#x27;s not an esthetician spa thing; (those things cost thousands of dollars) it&#x27;s for a nice foot soak done on your own.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t too loud and did its job. It wants me to have more words so I am typing. Ok done</li>
    <li> The bottom of the soaker is rough and not comfortable for aching feet.  Its nice for softening skin for pedicure but not reccomended for aching feet.</li>
    <li> I choose this foot spa after months of reading reviews and checking out all of the spa&#x27;s I could find.  What a deal, the price is so worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My feet love it.  It is a great way to relax in the evening.  It doesn&#x27;t heat the water, but it does keep the tempurature warm/hot during the soak which is fine with me.  It is no big deal to put the temp I want into the spa.  The bubbling action feels so good.  The attachments feel wonderful.  Thank you so much for making this Spa.  I am so glad I choose this product!!</li>
    <li> This product was exactly as I expected it to preform.  I would recommend this product. Igo for pedicures but I still use this product!</li>
    <li> Holds water. Doesn&#x27;t do much else. The bubbles aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;invigorating&amp;#34; as the description suggests. Pretty bummed I spent so much on this product.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t really say it &amp;#34;massages&amp;#34; your foot. But it does hold the temperature of the water quite well, which my problem with others. It bubbles alot and does relax the foot. It is relaxing but it the BEST foot massager I&#x27;ve ever used. But still very relaxing!</li>
    <li> I like it. I don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
    <li> The product is ok - it does the warm and cold massage for the feet but dint find the massage super effective</li>
    <li> We use the foot spa less than 5 times and it no longer turns on.  Big waste of money.</li>
    <li> Not too pleased with this tub. The bumps on the bottom hurt, it doesn&#x27;t keep the water warm and it&#x27;s super loud. The only good thing I can say is, it holds water.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mom for mother&#x27;s day and her experience with the product was largely disappointing. The product itself was lightweight and of appropriate size, thus the two stars, but the engine used to heat the water was objectionably loud despite its inability to even maintain the water temperature. For anyone looking for a foot spa that is more than a water-holder I would strongly advise you to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife for Christmas back in November. We finally opened it Jan. 6th, and it would not work right out of the box. We followed all of the set up instructions (like pouring water in it and turning it on is hard), and it did nothing. We even tried using a different outlet in a different room, to eliminate the possibility that it was our outlets fault, and that did not work. It&#x27;s basically a really expensive drinking dish for our dog. My dad bought a Dr. Scholl&#x27;s foot spa as well from walmart a few years ago, and it only worked for about two weeks, so I would recommend staying away from this brand all together.</li>
    <li> This is a great little foot spa. I got if for my wife for her birthday, and she loves it.</li>
    <li> This is a great foot spa, but be aware that it is &amp;#34;For Her&amp;#34;, so if you have big feet they won&#x27;t fit. Lightweight, 3 useful attachments are included. Hot water bubbles, but eventually cools off. Easy to clean because it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of nooks and crannies.</li>
    <li> the water not keep warm.</li>
    <li> This foot spa is marvelous for the money, in my opinion.  Just make sure to add hot water in the beginning, as it will cool down after 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to set up, the massage bumps on the bottom feel great, and the little massage roller really works!  I wear women&#x27;s size 11 and there is plenty of room.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting a foot spa for a while. Finally read all the reviews and bought this one. The reviews are what made my mind up. Love it. Glad I bought it. My feet sure feel better after a hard day at work. I also have diabetes, so I have to take great care of my feet. This is helping greatly.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping for a solution to my aching feet.  Turns out that this machine does almost nothing at all to help.  All it does is make bubbles and in the process cools the hot water I put into it especially quickly -- from as warm as I could stand it to room temperature in about 15 minutes, despite having a heating unit to keep the water warm.  Even the roller (or &amp;#34;massager&amp;#34; as they call it) is in a bad location; you can&#x27;t &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; the ball of your foot when your heel is hitting the back of the spa (and my feet are only size 9).  As much as I hate returning things, that&#x27;s exactly what I had to do with this because it was so disappointing.</li>
    <li> got it for my gf but it&#x27;s cheapley made, feels cheap, looks cheap and shes afraid she&#x27;s gunna break it, so it went into the garage.</li>
    <li> The water stays hot for a long time, it&#x27;s cute, it does what it&#x27;s suppose to, and it&#x27;s relaxing! My mother and I use this regularly for achy feet. The roller attachment on top will pop off if you rub on it too hard but no biggie, just pop it back in the hole. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Noisy! I cannot stand it. Additionally, it cannot heat up. You will need to add more hot water if you want to have feet spa in a longer time. But the bubbles are good enough-------</li>
    <li> I do not think these things are worth buying.  It feels kind of good, but it doesn&#x27;t really do much.  I spent a lot of time looking over reviews because I wasn&#x27;t sure if these things worked.  I don&#x27;t want to say it didn&#x27;t work, but more of I wasn&#x27;t impressed by what it did.  Spend the money and get a pedicure</li>
    <li> For me, this foot spa is just what I wanted. I had originally purchased a foot spa that cost $90 and it did not work for me. I have Diabetes and it actually kept the water TOO hot, and it was very uncomfortable on my feet.  I didn&#x27;t need a machine with lots of bells and whistles.  This is a very basic foot spa.  It says right on the box that the unit does NOT heat water.  It does, however, keep the water warm for about 20 mins., and that is the normal amount of time for a foot soak.  To me personally, I rather like starting with real warm water, then letting it cool down and ending with the cool water.  That&#x27;s just me personally, everyone likes different things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with pedicure items.  A removable pumice stone, a brush, nail clippers and toe separators, all in a little pouch.  There are no various functions to the machine.  It turns on and off, that&#x27;s it.  The machine provides lots of constant bubbles, which is very soothing and relaxing.  It is a little loud, but not loud enough to be real annoying.  You can put soaks, salts and oils in the unit - just clean after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the perfect foot spa for me, it is very relaxing and soothing.  My feet look and feel great with just a few uses.  Keeps them so clean and refreshed.  I love it and am very happy with my purchase.  I would recommend this spa if you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t care about all the bells and whistles some of the higher priced units offer.  And the price was very reasonable!</li>
    <li> Love this product and found it to be cheaper and of better quality than those I found in my local retail outlets.  My entire family is now  enjoying this at home pampering.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this for my tiresome achy feet, obviously. It works great on my sensitive feet. I use hot tap water to fill it up and it lasts about 10 minutes before it&#x27;s too cold. But that is just enough time for me. Though I am giving this 4 stars, there are a few things I want to mention as cons...&lt;br /&gt;Depending on where I have it set up - I can&#x27;t watch TV at the same time. When turned on, it messes with my TV signal making it impossible to soak my feet and watch TV at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect the accessories to replicate those at a spa. The pumice stone isn&#x27;t raised very high, and it isn&#x27;t coarse enough.&lt;br /&gt;The cord with either dangle or get placed inside the foot spa when not in use... but it would have been nice if there was something included to help keep the wound up cord at bay.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Exactly as described. We will not be using the attachments as our family will be sharing. We added some CVS foot soap &amp; it felt wonderful! I wish it had jets &amp; it would be PERFECT!</li>
    <li> What a great way to unwind after a long day on your feet. Love that it comes with a pumice stone, rolling massager and smart heat my wife loves it and our six year old daughter too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my granddaughter for Christmas....we looked everywhere for a good foot spa but the reviews were not so great.  This one by Dr. Scholl&#x27;s as everything my granddaughter was looking for and with good reviews....great prices too with free shipping, can&#x27;t beat it!!</li>
    <li> This would have gotten 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t leak after it&#x27;s first use. And I couldn&#x27;t return it because I got rid of all the packaging when it arrived. (As I&#x27;ve never had a problem with anything I&#x27;ve ever ordered). The bubbles were great and it kept the water warm...but, like I said, it leaked all over the floor, so not happy.</li>
    <li> I love this. I love this. I love this. It is so nice. You add hot water, plug it in and you have the option for vibrations or just still water. It is bumps on the bottom which are relaxing and it has a pumice stone, a rolling texture thingamagig and a plastic oval which has texture. All of these really relax your feet. There is a place in the middle between where you put your feet where you attach one of the aforementioned tools. You can only have one at a time. For the rest, there is a hook that fits over the edge of the foot bath where you can keep them. Alternatively, it also comes with a pretty bag that you can keep them it. It also comes with toenail clippers, but they don&#x27;t have a huge opening to clip, so it can be kind of awkward. Other than that, it is perfect.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully. Bought  this to give my 94yearold mother-in-law a pedicure. It works just great. It keeps warm water warm for long enough.  She was very pleased as well.</li>
    <li> Very nice for the price but wish it had a heating water feature but I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I love a home pedicure, I really do. I received this as a gift, and I wanted to like it, but it&#x27;s not that much better than a bucket and it&#x27;s a pain in the neck to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The setup is awkward because you have to fill it up with hot water that it keeps warm. There&#x27;s no handle on it, so you end up setting up the foot spa wherever it is you&#x27;re going to use it, then bring a bucket of hot water to fill it up. When you&#x27;re finished, you have to carry this big, heavy, sloshing thing to empty it out. A bucket&#x27;s easier with the handle to empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money. Spend it on great epsom salts, since they&#x27;ll make your pedicure a lot better for a lot less than the price this foot spa.</li>
    <li> The bubbler is a cool idea but very weak. Have to set it up and get in it before it gets cold which is minutes. Easier to just take a bath in my opinion. The stone is smooth, and permanently affixed. The roller are sharper. People must have some pretty thick callus&#x27; to find the rollers useful. It&#x27;s in the closet waiting for the goodwill.</li>
    <li> It would be nice if this was small (I have size 5 feet and don&#x27;t need all that room) but I guess it&#x27;s a one size fits all things. Works as a basic foot bath. I don&#x27;t care much for the vibrating massage or any of the massage pieces, but great for a salt soak and just relaxing after a long day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so not worth the price I paid (almost 30 bucks). You need to make sure to put the hottest water possible in because it doesn&#x27;t keep water warm and it barely vibrates. It is super loud though. I just find it to be a total waste.</li>
    <li> It had everything except a water heating unit.&lt;br /&gt;I like all the attachments.!&lt;br /&gt;I would still recommend it to anyone.!</li>
    <li> My fathers a construction worker who occasionally likes to be pampered, so I got him this because he constantly complains of achy feet. Unfortunately he only used it once and not well. The instructions were a bit unclear but then again he nor I had ever used a foot massager like this, were use to good old fashioned ones from people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried to use it only to find it uncomfortable, but it does work, it&#x27;s just not something I&#x27;m comfortable with. It feels very impersonal.</li>
    <li> I received the foot spa today and tried it. The set up is easy, have the water plus bath salts in the tub, have a towel ready, plug in, put your feet inside and press the on button. The bubbles are really relaxing, the noise of the air circulating doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, for $35 I would say it is a great deal. I am on my feet all day and this is 10 minute treat!</li>
    <li> Only used it once up to yet but I&#x27;m very happy with it! I do a lot of walking and running so my feet are in need of some relaxation and this really does help. It doesn&#x27;t keep the water warm for long but to be honest you shouldn&#x27;t keep it on for more than 20 minutes at a time anyway.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed this product very much.  Just remember to put very warm water to start with.  This product does not warm up the water.</li>
    <li> This product is just great. It really does what it promises so well. The only thing they can really improve upon is the heating mechanism - it is not that good. You have to pre-heat and water and add to the spa. Otherwise, an overall great product!!</li>
    <li> Great product ,but the water doesn&#x27;t stay warm</li>
    <li> This foot spa is fair but the little bumps meant to massage your feet are uncomfortable to me. In addition, the warm water you put in becomes cool very fast 10 minutes or so.  This does not maintain the heat!!!</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful! Big enough for larger feet and works good for small ones also! Soothing bubbles feel so much better than the vibration of other foot baths!</li>
    <li> On it&#x27;s own, this little thing and it&#x27;s blasts of bubbles will make your feet feel great. Pair it with some essential oils, or a tea tree based foot soak to make this into a fantastic tool for keeping your feet smooth, healthy and fungus free. Me, I use tea tree foot soak and a few drops of lavender oil. Believe me, I had the worst feet ever, but that combination has left them looking better than they ever had. Too many people buy these, or receive them as gifts and then never use them, but if used regularly, they are a fantastic way to care for your feet. I love it, use it 3 times a week and no, you can&#x27;t borrow it :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: As some other reviews state, this does not heat water, but reasonably effectively maintains the temperature of the water you put into it.</li>
    <li> Just like most of the others, it does not hold the heat long enough.,</li>
    <li> So far we love this food spa.  We bought one from walmart that said warming and it cooled down within minutes.  This one keeps the water warm.</li>
    <li> I have one in China, so I know how good it is~&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll suggest everyone to buy one, it&#x27;s very useful in winter~</li>
    <li> My brother loves the foot bath. He said he uses it 3 times a week. It made a real change in his feet. He suffers from diabetes.</li>
    <li> Like a lot of other &amp;#34;foot spa package&amp;#34; machines, this one does nothing at all to maintain heat. Motor is noisy too. The &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; texture on the bottom was not comfortable for me (personally) and the roller in the middle only made my sore feet hurt more to use. Good if you want the bubbles, but look elsewhere for the warmth.</li>
    <li> My daughters and I treated their mom to a foot spa for her birthday, and it was a big hit.  Price is very reasonable and it arrived as advertised.  All good.</li>
    <li> This foot spa is a disappointment and not worth the money. The bottom is supposed to &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; one&#x27;s feet, I guess, but the bumps are sharp and irritating, not soothing. It doesn&#x27;t keep the water warm for very long at all, even when I start out with very hot water. It bubbles, but that&#x27;s about it. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I work in a furniture store, and I am up on my feet all day. I bought this so my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t have to rub my feet every day after I come home. It works fantastic! The only down side, for me at least, is that if it has been used for more than 30mins, my feet start to get annoyed with the vibration - so I wish it had different vibration settings. Other than that though, it&#x27;s really great!</li>
    <li> Perfect. Got bubbles, a little heat but  you have to add hot water then keep it hot. Other than that, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I just received the foot spa this afternoon. I put hot water in and put my feet in, then the water start cooling down in about 15~20mins, If you want to buy a foot spa that can actually keep the water warm, DON&#x27;T buy this.</li>
    <li> everything a foot spa should be. relaxing easy to operate easy on the eye so good to store away when handling</li>
    <li> It Works great water stays warm. I would recommend it.It is well worth the money. My wife loves it also.</li>
    <li> Love this gadget!! I had a 12-hour shift at work and came home to this for the first time. It was the best!</li>
    <li> Arrived with a couple big cracks at the bottom of the water basin. Good thing I noticed before filling it up and spilling water all over my house. The item just seemed really cheap overall. Got a refund and didn&#x27;t bother getting a replacement.</li>
    <li> No bubbles!! Why?? I am so sad.</li>
    <li> Of what is this unit made? Doesn&#x27;t say BPA-free. So this is toxic. That means one would be soaking one&#x27;s feet for health reasons in a toxic carcinogenic soup. Say No!&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE RESEARCH YOURSELF- FOR YOUR HEALTH &amp; SAFETY!</li>
    <li> JUST GOT THIS A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, AND HAVE USED IT TWICE AND I AM VERY SATISFIED TO THIS POINT.</li>
    <li> Even though any kind of heat was B.S. the foot spa works wonderfully. My GF recently started working at a bar and is on her feet all day. I got her this as well as some Epsom salt and the two work wonderfully together for a nice relaxing foot bath. Put hot water in and it stays hot for a little while. Long enough to enjoy. But if you are like me and want a really hot foot bath that stays hot you will need to spend a lot more. For the price we are both quite happy.</li>
    <li> I had a few issues with this.  First, I understand it won&#x27;t heat water, but it IS supposed to help keep water warm.  But when I put water so hot I could barely put my feet in it to start, I was shocked at how quickly it cooled down.  So I tested with it unplugged, and the temp drop was just about the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next issue was how narrow the feet areas actually are because of the width of the middle section.  If you&#x27;re just soaking, that&#x27;s not bad, but I like to rub a bit to get off any loose or dry skin.  I couldn&#x27;t even fit my fingers between the sides of my foot and the sides of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next was the bubbles.  I would prefer something that the bubbles aren&#x27;t on all the time.  There is no &amp;#34;try to heat but no bubbles&amp;#34; option, it&#x27;s all or nothing.  And the bubbles are probably half the reason it does such a poor job of keeping the water warm.  I&#x27;ve seen reviews of other units that had bubbles as an option that could be on or off, and most people said the water stayed warmer when they didn&#x27;t use that option.  So now I need to look for something that, if it has bubbles, allows them to be turned off separately from the heating unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is pretty typical quality for something under $50, so I think it&#x27;s going to be time to bite the bullet and buy something that&#x27;s over $100 and has better quality and functionality.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and it broke the second time I used it! Not very happy!!!</li>
    <li> Great product and it arrived as described.</li>
    <li> Massages well but does not keep water warm at all. The water became cold rather quickly and that was a big disappointment.</li>
    <li> Water doesn&#x27;t stay warm. It&#x27;s a waste of money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This foot bath bubbles ok but it by no means heats anything. The water is cold within 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.  Does not heat or keep the water warm. I should have returned it, but too late now.</li>
    <li> It does make my feet feel nice ....but on the downside, it&#x27;s rather a pain to have to fill it with water and then when finished empty it and it takes up a lot of room that I do not really have.  But, it was a Christmas gift from my husband and I do appreciate it.</li>
    <li> I so love the foot spa, it relaxes my feet wonderfully. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because its just a little noisy but its a machine so it would be. other than that I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and I to use. My husband works long shifts and his feet hurt after work. He uses this when his feet are really sore and loves it.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s working great. Bought this for my mom because she  had foot surgery and has arthritis and swelling on her feet. It really has helped with the pain and swelling, she uses it everyday. As for the water temperature it does keep the water temp. Using warm water for one hour everyday, after the hour is up the water is still warm. The vibration is good and feels like it&#x27;s massaging your feet.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on August 23rd.  Today is September 5 and apparently today is the day they decided to finally ship this. A reminder of why to stick with products that have Prime shipping option.  These guys just kill the convenience factor.  If I know it would take them two weeks just to stick it in a UPS box, I would have just gone to the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 09/10.  I can&#x27;t believe it.  checked tracking this morning and it says they will deliver today.  only 18 days to get this product to Southern California.  super fast</li>
    <li> Easy to use and works the way I wanted.  I do wish it would hold the heat better.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed there was no adapter and we had to wait for weeks for it to come it should have been included</li>
    <li> It is probably a great (4.5 - 5 star) item for someone with slightly smaller feet. Maybe size 10 men or smaller.  I&#x27;m a wide 11.5 and it is almost overflowing when I put my &amp;#34;dogs&amp;#34; in.  Deeper and wider would be better for me.  Works well, just larger would be nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she loved it. The only caveat is the size, it&#x27;s a bit larger than I thought, but perhaps that makes it worth more? I don&#x27;t know. The fact that it only works for less than 30 minutes doesn&#x27;t bode well either. It&#x27;s a good buy, not an incredible one, but definitely worth denoting. It works, perhaps that&#x27;s what I should be glorifying here, but I don&#x27;t know, there&#x27;s something kind of missing, and I can&#x27;t put my finger on it. Overall it&#x27;s adequate, a step up from just a regular tub. I like it. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s just not perfect. My girlfriend enjoys it, so perhaps that&#x27;s the best thing.</li>
    <li> To small for my big fat feet size 15</li>
    <li> It is ok but really nothing more than a container to hold the water. Save your money and buy a plastic bin to put the hot water in.</li>
    <li> This is awkward, the water does not stay warm. It is uncomfortable. The vibration of the motor was so loud that I could not hear the TV! When I use this I don&#x27;t bother to plug it in. Save your money and buy a plastic dishpan.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife and she loves it. I also end up using it after a long day. All I do is add hot water and a little epson salt.</li>
    <li> Well I love this. Makes my feet feel great. Yeah it doesn&#x27;t actually heat the water, but if you put in the heated water to the temperature you want it when you fill it, it keeps heated well enough - at least for the 15 minutes I&#x27;ve used it for.</li>
    <li> I was charged twice for this foot spa and have had this product for 2 months.  The power was intermittent the first month and no longer worked the second month.  Of course It was non-returnable after 1 month. I&#x27;m very dissatisfied!</li>
    <li> My whole family uses it more than I do. People fight over taking turns lol! It doesn&#x27;t really heat up but it vibrates and makes your feet feel cool and tingly.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this foot bath. A great way to pamper your feet &amp; feelike good.</li>
    <li> Works great! Water stays hot for a long time. It is a very good quality product..worth every penny paid for :)</li>
    <li> This foot spa is wider then my other foot spa it&#x27;s so comfortable that I dose of and got up 15 minutes later.&lt;br /&gt;What a great product.</li>
    <li> Only used it a few times so far, did not keep the water warm for long and I put very hot water into the appliance.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved this thing, hours of fun soaking great for a girly girl</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t keep water warm but I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to after reading the other reviews. Feels great and does the job.</li>
    <li> Have no comment except to say I really enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Does not hold the water temperature as long as a regular foot tub, air bubbles cooled off the water quickly. Looks inviting but not as useful as advertisement would have you believe.</li>
    <li> As noted by others this item will not cure all your foot problems but it definitely helps make your feet feel better and the sooner you start pampering your feet the better.  It eases some of the discomfort from wearing shoes all day and I think with younger people it can help prevent some of the issues that older people find.  It is never too soon to start.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I have big feet (size 10) and they fit great. No complaints. Nice treat after a long day.  Holds the water&#x27;s heat very well.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS FOOT SPA. WORKS GREAT!  THE BUBBLES FEEL AMAZING ON TIRED FEET.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as a gift he loves it and I even use it. It is very relaxing and easy to use</li>
    <li> USE THIS QUITE OFTEN.ESPESIALLY LOVE HOW IT HEATS UP. CAN&#x27;T TELL IF I&#x27;M IN A SALON OR AT HOME. A LITTLE EPSOM SALT AND A GLASS OF WINE AND IM RELAXED.</li>
    <li> I brought this for my wife and she loves it! I would recommend this product. Plus it got here in record time.</li>
    <li> good for the price.  Found the plastic foot bed more pokey on my foot rather then soothing.</li>
    <li> This foot spa is amazing! I had put hot water in and it really maintained the temperature! Im extremely impressed especially because reading other reviews about the water going cold, however my experience was the opposite and I really enjoyed it. My advice is to read the directions throughly and once it is properly set up just add your favorite doot soak.for example I use the Dr.Teals Epsom Salt foot soak in cooling peppermint and I put my feet inside and bam im in heaven! I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase :)</li>
    <li> My 11 year old daughter loves this foot bath.  It comes with lots of little gadgets that she uses.  It also makes bubbles so it feels extra luxurious.  We pour in warm water so it is soothing to the feet.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting one for quite a while. This was defiantly worth the price</li>
    <li> I had my previous foot bath for over 10 years. Like it better but this will do.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t heat the water but other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> works very well could use a little more heat, with the vibrations and warm water feels good. will know more with time.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my grandmother. I tried it before her to make sure I  explain her how to use it safely. Is not heavy, which is good. Easy to fill in and clean . You can hear the buzz sound while is on but I would not consider it loud. I liked the bubbles but I was specting to feel the vibrations I have felt before with an old foot spa massager my mother had when I was a kid, maybe this one only has the bubbles future. Overall I liked the massage and the sensation of the bubbles but to have a better feeling I recommend you let your feet flow in the water. The packaging was good. Not heavy and easy to open. Shipping was fast. About the smart heat feature I can&#x27;t say anything cuz I didn&#x27;t use it with warm water. But I will update the review once my granny uses it. I know she will like it but I don&#x27;t want her to get scared or uncomfortable cuz of the bubbles :) she liked the Pedicure tools that came with it.  The massaging thing in the middle is nice. I&#x27;m a size 10w and it has enough room for my feet. I gave a 4 cuz the 5 it will be if she uses it and likes it like as much as I do</li>
    <li> I have wanted to get a foot spa for years, so I finally did it! As long as you place water that is as hot as you can stand into the basin from the get go, it does maintain the heat for a significant amount of time. I am done before the water is anywhere near lukewarm, and that is a good 45 mins of sitting in foot spa heaven. The little tools that can attach to the centre of the spa seem awkward to use and I can do without all but the pumice stone.  Since the basin is just made out of plastic, and water isn&#x27;t THAT heavy, if you really want to work your feet on the tools, you might find yourself almost knocking the thing over! That aside, I didn&#x27;t buy it for the tools; I bought it for vibration and heat retention.  It ticks those boxes for me!</li>
    <li> It gets my feet all soft and relaxed I really like this product!!! The only reason why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars it&#x27;s cause of the heating... it doesn&#x27;t heat at all and the water.. no matter how hot you put it.. it will cool down pretty fast.. but other than that I love it</li>
    <li> This only vibrates (no bubbles) and the vibration actually made my feet numb. I liked their bubbling model that is no longer available.</li>
    <li> Really nice to relax soaking my feet after a long day standing at work.</li>
    <li> I like the bubbles and the included accessories.  The massage roller is a bit prickly, but still a nice touch.  It does not, though, keep water warm.  The water cools just as quickly as if it was sitting in a plastic bowl, and even more quickly with the bubbles on.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend can now continue to keep her feet looking kissable-sexy without going to the nail salon every two weeks!</li>
    <li> The water doesn&#x27;t stay warm at all. It&#x27;s back to being cold in just a few minutes. I don&#x27;t use it as often as I&#x27;d like, because it&#x27;s really not worth the hassle of refilling it when the water gets cold.</li>
    <li> Great spa - feet  very soft and feel wonderful.  fit even very large feet.</li>
    <li> The quality is not as good as what I bought from a local store.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift to me from my husband and I love it!</li>
    <li> The product performed about as expected, but it is VERY noisy when it is turned on.</li>
    <li> Small bag of accessories was poor quality but foot spa was worth the price I paid I don&#x27;t regret the purchase!i wish it massaged my feet more though.the intensity is not that great but the bubbles are a nice touch!</li>
    <li> I searched for a foot bath for a while, and found that this one had it all.  The size is right, it massages,  and the price is right!&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Did not use yet but think it&#x27;s good</li>
    <li> If you have read the reviews above and know what to expect yet still bought it, you won&#x27;t be surprised. It is pretty relaxing but again does not heat the water whatsoever. The bubble effect is calming and the rough bottom and the middle roll provide some massaging effect.&lt;br /&gt;A good buy for a daily relaxing foot bath.</li>
    <li> Nice sturdy unit that has a good depth for soaking.  Can&#x27;t say it really keeps water warm, the instructions state max use /cycle time is 20 minutes and my water is usually tepid by then so hence the four stars.  Cleans up easily and sloshing and splash are minimized by the cover.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done! Perfect way to unwind after a long day at the office or running around doing errands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foot spa does not heat cold water but maintains the temperature of the water you place into the tub. I love the bubbles and built in massage roller.. it&#x27;s very therapeutic and a great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Helps after a long day of work</li>
    <li> After a long day on my feet its just what I need to relax. The water doesn&#x27;t stay as hot as I would like but all in all very soothing.</li>
    <li> I bought this foot spa because it was at a reasonable price and I liked the different features added to the device. The first time I used it I added epsom salt and a little bit of shower gel soap. I placed my tired aching feet into very warm water and was suprised at how wonderful it felt to feel the bubbles under my feet massaging the pain away. The punice stone helps to rub the dry skin off your feet and the massage roller relieved the pain that I suffer from heel spurs. When I was done using the foot spa I rubbed lotion over my feet and stood up to walk and was really amazed that I felt no pain at all, and of how soft my feet felt.</li>
    <li> Was expecting a little more. But it was relaxing</li>
    <li> It is ok, for the price is a good, I of course would like some with more power and bubbles, stronger , etc... but Can not complain, I have for 6 months and works wihout problems</li>
    <li> I GOT THIS FOR MY BOYFRIEND. HE WORKS LONG HOURS ON HIS FEET. THIS HELPED HIM OUT A LOT! THANKS FOR THE BUSINESS.</li>
    <li> Seems great the picture and description but doesn&#x27;t massage. It blows bubbles but once you place your feet in n inside the bubbles stop.</li>
    <li> I received the foot spa today.  Initially I was struck by the paucity of instructions.  I whipped out my microscope to read the few English instructions included.  There is no mention of the use of the items in the pedicure pouch.  I assume that the nail clippers are not to be used with the foot spa!  The nail brush and toe separators, I dunno.  Also the build-in features in the center of the spa tub are a little curious: The round pumice stone, the round bumpy pad, and the nub-studded roller?  Are these perhaps Masonic symbols?  Maybe one day I will intuit their purpose.  The top of the tub has two sets of wavy strips which would comfortably support the feet during a pedicure, but the pedicurist would need to lie on the floor or stand in a hole!  What a visual!  Nonetheless, I spent about 15 pleasant minutes with my feet immersed in the spa bubble bath.  It feels good!  I suppose it is too early to expect any long-lasting benefit.  I will continue to spa (20 minutes max per day sayeth the instructions), and hopefully my feet will eventually find relief.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my mom and she really likes it. She uses it nearly daily to improve her cracked heels. She said that it was comfortable to use and has really helped her heels. For the price I paid it turned out to be a great buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint from my mom is that it doesn&#x27;t keep the water as warm as she wants it, but then again she thinks most hot tubs arent warm enough.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  This thing is flimsy, and nearly as noisy as a hair dryer.  There is no insulation to the soaker part, and the bubbles are blown so vigorously that the water cools very quickly.  I&#x27;m giving it 1 more star than it deserves because the vendor did a great job of getting this POS to my house quickly.  Look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Does NOT KEEP the water hot. I know it doesn&#x27;t make the water hot but it can&#x27;t even keep it at a decent temperature!!</li>
    <li> It is a very nice foot spa, but it am elderly and found it to heavy for me to move it. I intend to return it. I also wondered if it was used,because there was no yellow sticker on the side and you could tell where it had been. Also had a lot of white stuff splashed over the purple, but it washed off.&lt;br /&gt;I think a young person would like it. I bought a plastic rectangle thing and I can handle that.</li>
    <li> We purchased this for my sister in law for her Nail salon in DR.  It arrived and she loves it.  Her clients enjoy it as well.</li>
    <li> i bought two of these for my parents and in laws and thought it would be a nice gift...the features are nice...but the tub itself is incredibly small..if you&#x27;re larger than a size 7.5 foot size..don&#x27;t buy..the price is great compared to other stores but it&#x27;s too small..i will be sending both back....would not recommend..</li>
    <li> I apologize in advance if this reads as spam - I have been looking for a good Foot Bath / Foot Spa for less than $70 for six months now. I have left comments on products that either died after a few uses or were completely unacceptable - my bottom line is “Is this product better than a bucket of hot water and Epsom salts?”&lt;br /&gt;All this being said – the one thing I feel ALL reviewers and perspective buyers should know is – You Will Not Find A HEATED Foot Spa/Bath here or ANYWHERE for less than $200+.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I say this so strongly is – the #1 complaint I see here and on other pages is “It does not keep the water hot ; the water turned cold after 15 minutes. Etc..” Do any of you seriously think a $25-$60 plastic bucket that vibrates or bubbles is really going to the have heating elements to raise water temperature to a ‘spa’ level? That my friend is just marketing stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is – if you can find a product that has reliable – motors, buttons, bubble jets, etc – you are good to go – suck it up and refill the hot water every 20 mins or so as needed.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Heat&amp;#34; is a fiction with this thing.  I wanted something that would give me relief from long days hauling cameras all over, and this is just a vibrating air-stone in a bump tub.  There are no setting controls,  Everything about it is uncomfortable.  I had a Conaire that worked far better and was only slightly more expensive.  Look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I bought this spa a month ago. There was no information on the fact that this spa is not good for people with bad circulation on Amazon page but after one usage I had a blister and when I looked at the box carefully it says that the spa must not be used for people with bad circulation. This information should have been included on Amazon website.</li>
    <li> I got this for the boyfriend for a gift and he loves it .. works good!!!</li>
    <li> The foot spa is great and is very quiet. It&#x27;s not as powerful as my other foot spa, but everyone seems to like it when I do their feet. The only thing I don&#x27;t like it that I can&#x27;t add my foot soak I normally use because it creates bubbles. Guess I&#x27;ll have to change my soak. Oh well. Evert product has its pros and cons</li>
    <li> It is a nice product, just wish the massage was more intense.</li>
    <li> Since it is made of plastic, it smells very bad when I plug it in and turn it on.</li>
    <li> I expected a bit more because it looks so pretty. It is not worth the money, as it is just a glorified place to put your feet in warm water.  I might have liked it better if it wasn&#x27;t so loud - the motor only keeps the water bubbling.  Get a pedicure instead.</li>
    <li> Love this Item.&lt;br /&gt;I do not understand the piece in center of Foot Spa but the tools found inside the pouch -YAY!&lt;br /&gt;I have always liked Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Products.  But, this item outdoes it and really works.  Easy to Clean.</li>
    <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy with this product. It is a little bit loud but it seems to do the trick and is very affordable.</li>
    <li> Price is good and function as described.</li>
    <li> This is a nice compact device. Functions very well. Appealing to look at. Lightweight. East to use. Comes with accessories.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my mother&#x27;s 65th Birthday. She loves it!!!! My mother is very picky, if she love this foot spa....trust me it&#x27;s a winner!!!</li>
    <li> Love to soak, and relax my feet in this warm foot spa. I recommend this product to anyone who needs the same.</li>
    <li> This product began leaking within am month</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I have used it several times and it works great.</li>
    <li> The bottom of this foot spa has lots of raised hard nubs that feel like a bed of nails and are very painful. My last foot bath had the nubs, but they were designed differently and were comfortable.  Also, the description says, &amp;#34;SMART Heat system keeps water warm for soothing relief&amp;#34; which is untrue. I filled it to the fill line with very warm water that didn&#x27;t stay warm any longer than bath water.</li>
    <li> I do like this product, but it does not keep the water very warm. I think it does not heat the water at all. The massage does help my sore feet.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my daughter for Christmas.  She says this has been such a relief for her feet.  She would recommend this brand above the others.  It makes her feet feel so relaxed.  The water does cool  in time but she says that OK.  She loves the vibration of the water.</li>
    <li> its very nice, it isnt truly heated and it does get cold a little quicker than what id like but over all its very soothing and relaxing. I actually boil my water and then just hover my heat over it until i can stand it.</li>
    <li> The Pumice stone is pretty much useless and the massaging roller is in a horribly inconvenient spot. I have a womens size 5 foot and I have a very hard time using the roller. The location makes it almost impossible to move your foot over it and the back of the bowl is so close that my heel hits it because there&#x27;s not enough room.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone that is on their feet every day.  I am a cashier and all through the busy holiday season as soon as I got home I immediately poured in the warm water , turned the foot spa on and my feet said &amp;#34;AHHHHH!&amp;#34; So relaxing...just wish the water would stay hot longer because it really feels good when it is at the right temp.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nothing special. You have to fill it up with HOT water. It just cools down too fast. I don&#x27;t notice that it heats the water whatsoever..? We just have to fill with hot water, it gets cold, we have to go DUMP the water, and fill up again with hot. It&#x27;s kind of a pain in the neck and takes the relaxation out of it if you&#x27;re trying to just sit and have a little spa day with your daughter, for example! It&#x27;s not horrible, but nothing special. Vibrates and creates bubbles..whoopty doo. Seems to expensive for just that.</li>
    <li> average action, convenient way to soak feet</li>
    <li> This thing is a lifesaver. I have severe foot pain/sensitivity and this has helped me relieve some of the pain on almost a daily basis. Relatively quite running, works great with bath salts for a good foot soak. Only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the lack of heat retention. I put very warm water in and unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t really hold the heat for long. After about 30 minutes the water&#x27;s cold (though I&#x27;m usually relaxed enough by that point not to care, ha!).</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually like 5 star or 1 or 2 star reviews bc people either have a gripe about something where their expectations are way above what they should be, or they rave about, again, expectations that are way above what they should be.  I just want to know if I should buy something and I want facts to decide this, so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll try to give you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Unit is not magic.  It&#x27;s just a fun way to soak your feet.&lt;br /&gt;- Bubbles worked, but if you&#x27;re imagining jet streams from a jacuzzi tub, then you&#x27;re probably one of those 1 or 2 star reviewers who have oddly high expectations for a fairly cheap unit.&lt;br /&gt;- I boiled water over the stove to put in the unit and mixed with room temp/cold water to get the warmth that I wanted.  I don&#x27;t believe that the warming feature on the unit is all that effective.  I soaked for 20 minutes and the temp of the water did gradually go down, but by then the 20 minutes was up and I was done.  You&#x27;re not really supposed to soak longer than that anyways.  I kept some of the extra boiled water next to me to add if I wanted to, but I didn&#x27;t end up adding any bc I didn&#x27;t really need to.&lt;br /&gt;- FYI: the unit is shallow, so I would place a large towel underneath the unit to catch any sloshed water and it&#x27;s good for when you have to step out.&lt;br /&gt;- I cannot speak to the pedicure/massage features bc I did not use them (although, from what I could tell, they did not seem all that effective or of good quality just judging from appearance).&lt;br /&gt;- Not for people with really big feet.  I am size 8-9 ladies and my boyfriend is 10 mens and it was very comfortable for us.  I would check measurements to be sure before you buy bc it will not feel good at all to squeeze into the unit and just barely fit.&lt;br /&gt;- It is loud.  We just turn up the tv.  I would equate the sound to the loudness level of maybe a hair dryer on low.  It&#x27;s not jarring and sharp like a blender.&lt;br /&gt;- What else....after boiling the hot water, I added Epsom salts and dissolved them before I poured the water into the unit (the idea is to not have to step on them when you put your feet in and also so you don&#x27;t plug up the holes where the bubbles come out).  It seemed to work nicely.&lt;br /&gt;- Packaging was fine when I received it.&lt;br /&gt;- Cleaning: I just dumped out water, rinsed and turned it upside down to dry (not sure if that was good enough, but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve done).&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;ve only used this unit twice, so I cannot speak to the longevity of it.&lt;br /&gt;- Recap:  This is a glorified bubble bucket.  That&#x27;s all this is.  The bubbles are the only feature that really makes this any different from a bucket.  I find the bubbles fun and soothing.  I don&#x27;t mind heating the water and I don&#x27;t mind that nothing else on it works all that well, which is why I still gave it 4 stars.  I hope this info helps to make your decision.lved them before I poured the water into the unit (the idea is to not have to step on them when you put your feet in and also so you don&#x27;t plug up the holes where the bubbles come out).

    <li> Bought it for my wife for her birthday. She absolutely loves it and has received much benefit from it.</li>
    <li> On the negative side it does not keep the water at the temperature it was when filled, as the description led me to believe. On the plus side the vibration helps circulation, and the included tools are very helpful.</li>
    <li> I got this foot spa for my mom she could not wait to use it! Works amazingly and I love how it came with the accessories and attachments! It holds a good amount of water but you can&#x27;t push you feet to hard in the bath area or it will stop vibrating. Over all great Foot Spa!</li>
    <li> I love this thing! It&#x27;s not a high end spa, but I use it after long days at work and it makes my feet feel so good! It&#x27;s pretty quiet and the water does stay warn if you keep your feet to the bottom of the tub. The little bumps on the bottom of the tub also feel great on sore feet. I&#x27;ve already recommended this spa to my co-workers.</li>
    <li> I confess that I have not yet been able to use this much.  I am not yet able to fill and empty it by myself.&lt;br /&gt;I know it will be nice when I get to where I can use it.  It is well made, comfortable to use.  Does not heat the water, but will keep warm enough to do a foot bath.</li>
    <li> I really have enjoyed this foot bath. I purchased it a month ago, and use it about every other day. Its pretty quiet, and the bubbles are very relaxing.  If you start your foot bath with hot water you will have no problem with ice cold water when used for a normal amount of time-20 to 30 minutes. The heater helps to keep it warmer but it certainly isn&#x27;t made to warm up cold water.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact my husband can fit his feet in the bath, wears a size 13 wide shoe if that helps gauge the foot space this bath has. I love this product and would recommend to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend several hundred dollars on a foot bath.</li>
    <li> It does what it needs too. I really could have just purchased a cheap plastic bin to use and accomplish the same thing.</li>
    <li> My feet were VERY dry after a long summer with lots of walking, swimming and cracked feet. My feet were very beat up, and this finally repaired them! Anytime I feel some cracks coming on, I go right to this! It saved my poor feet!</li>
    <li> Its so big， but is not multifunction</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it.  The nubs on the bottom hurt my feet rather than sooth them.  I had the item refunded.</li>
    <li> nice to use as soak, but vibration with aerator looses heat fast...</li>
    <li> Will not keep water hot. Fill your bathtub with hot water and save your money.</li>
    <li> I have owned other foot baths,but this really gives a spa-feel to soaking the feet.  I use mine at least once. a week and feel like I can walk on air, afterwards.  This was one of my best purchases...no regrets at all.  Try it, you&#x27;ll love it too...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase. This is an easy, no-fuss foot spa that you can use to relax aching feet. No assembly required and is very easy to maintain. This doesn&#x27;t have some of the numerous attachments some comparable products have, but I don&#x27;t think they are really needed ever. If you looking to upgrade from a foot bucket have a couple of goodies to pamper your feet, this will be more than enough. Vibration capability is a nice add, and it&#x27;s easy to store. (These things can get big and awkwardly shaped)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of words on heat: This does not heat water, nor does it really maintain the temperature all that long. It says it does, but that has to be a little bit of puffery. Filled to the max line, water temp probably drops to room temperature within 20 minutes....more than enough time to relax and treat your feet. By the time water temp is a problem I&#x27;m ready to take my feet out anyway, so it&#x27;s not a deal breaker nor a reason for 4 stars for me.</li>
    <li> Is be an excellent product but not deep enough for the recommended treatment for me. I hope to return it.</li>
    <li> this is so great, I love it and would highly recommend it.  Easy to use and you can add bubble bath soap</li>
    <li> Not a bad option if you plan only to use it 10 minutes at a time. The Smart Heat promised is really misleading. You&#x27;d think the water stays warm. it actually does not. i like the bubbles, the massaging roll and the elegant design, but THE WATER GETS COLD IN MINUTES. it really does. then you have to dry your feet, get out of that recliner, walk to the sink and fill it up again and  ADD NEW SALT. it seems cheaper then those foot spas that heat up the water, however, in just a few months use you will lose all that money on SALTS you have to add up every time you change the cold water for hot. it&#x27;ll add up. they would have better off NOT PROMISING HEAT (smart or silly) at all. that&#x27;s just misleading. i&#x27;m thinking about sending it back as i&#x27;m tired running to the sink every 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> Very basic but just what we were looking for.</li>
    <li> Very nice and worth the money. I bought this with the tea tea oils and it worked wonderfully</li>
    <li> Exactly as listed, quick delivery, no problems at all.</li>
    <li> Easy to clean and use. The SMART Heat system doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I like the spa - it doesn&#x27;t keep the water hot for very long. I actually had to change the water to make it hotter so I could soak my feet longer.  Overall the foot spa is OK, I would have given it more stars if the water stayed hotter longer.</li>
    <li> Great foot bath. Simple but works well and holds a lot of water.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery!</li>
    <li> It does the job just fine!  My only complaint is that is seriously noisy.</li>
    <li> I hate it, the bowl is too shallow &amp; the water cools to fast.</li>
    <li> i LEAVE THE WATET IN THE FOOT SPA AND BY THE TIME THT 20 MIN SOKE IS OVR IT IS STARTING TO WOURM UP THE WATER.</li>
    <li> It does what it says but the noise is something else.  The cats were next to it when I turned it on and they ran when they heard the noise it makes.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, but I do not see this is useful,. instead just use a bucket and warm water to soak ur feet.</li>
    <li> This bath spa works beautifully. It&#x27;s so relaxing and makes me feel like I&#x27;m having a spa treatment. Buy it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I like it very much. I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!! good. But cannot keep warm.</li>
    <li> not very useful in terms of massage the feet, it just shaking is all, so not worth or not very effective</li>
    <li> What a junk item. Rolling massager is so spiked it hurts your feet, as well as the bottom of the bath.&lt;br /&gt;It might be ok for someone who has really callous feet, but if you don&#x27;t, it hurts. I am not a construction worker.&lt;br /&gt;My feet are not calloused.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t heat well at all and makes a lot of noise when you turn it on. I would return if I could. Really poor quality.</li>
    <li> It is seriously a waste of 35$. It does nothing but produce a bunch of bubbles in the water. Its not a SPA by any means. The mounting that comes on top of it broke as well in just one use. The pumice stone came off. The water gets cold in 5 mins.</li>
    <li> This spa was suppose to keep the water warm and it does not!!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if the bubbles have any benefit. The bumpy bottom and knurled middle roller helps my foot circulation. My doctor suggested soaking my feet twice a day for my neuropathy condition, and  a similar sized plain Rubbermaid pan costs $17 at the supermarket.</li>
    <li> I bought this foot tub for my daughter who is on her feet many hours of the day.  She loves it.  Before buying I checked several foot tubs ranging in price from $25-$82.This foot tub&#x27;s ratings were comparable with the ones for $82.  I decided on this one because of quality and great price.</li>
    <li> Bought it November, 2013.  Used weekly.  By February, 2014 it already is broken.  The water no longer heats up, and now spurts out water on the sides.  I don&#x27;t like messing with broken, cheap electrical products that involve submerging my body parts into water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hardly ever write a review...I chose to write this since it broke Feb 9th, and the return policy was that I only can get refunded if returned by Jan 31.  So.....  Dr Scholl may have taken my money, but I want to help out my fellow citizens of the world by informing them of this garbage!</li>
    <li> This foot spa works just as it says it should.  My wife and daughters did have a problem filling it too full.. but that was user error.  Wife says the jelly foot soak is a little weird.. smells good but.. something to get used to.. but all in all very satisfied with the product.  Didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because if you have big feet like my wife.. a woman&#x27;s size 10 there isn&#x27;t much room to move around.. but for the money it works.</li>
    <li> Not noisy. Basic as opposed as &#x27;too many bells and whistles!&amp;#34; Thank you, to those among you who responded to my inquiry re. noise factor. You are right! It&#x27;s not noisy. Great product. I can hardly wait to get in that weekly, relaxing, long foot-bath! Ahhhh....... Mrs. O&#x27;B</li>
    <li> My boyfriend and I each ordered a foot spa (his is &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34; and he made me promise not to tell any of his friends!), and I like his better. That being said, this is a good quality foot spa, it is quiet and relaxing. It just doesn&#x27;t have any of the fun attachments as the one my boyfriend got.</li>
    <li> I like this foot spa.  I work retail and got this during a pregnancy so that I could come home and soak my sore feet at the end of the day.  It feels great and I like the attachments it comes with, though I don&#x27;t use them very often.  The heating element on it isn&#x27;t very strong or I would have given it a 5 Star review.</li>
    <li> Works as described. Very pleased</li>
    <li> This machine does its job for a fraction of the price. The water doesn&#x27;t stay hot for too long and there is not really much of a massage to it. I wish it would provide more massage qualities. It&#x27;s a cheap alternative however.</li>
    <li> The construction is sturdy and the movement of the water is adequate. Does not keep the water warm, so even when using hot water it only lasts about six to ten minutes.</li>
    <li> Like others have said, it doesn&#x27;t heat, so be sure to put water in as hot as you can tolerate. For me, it serves the purpose of soaking, but not much more. Biggest negative for this &amp;#34;value priced&amp;#34; foot spa is that the water overflows behind your feet, so be sure to use towels or other absorbant pad in place before use. As for the extras included, the nail clippers fell apart immediately when adjusting for use, so were useless. The nail brush is so fine, I also found useless and discarded. The bubble circulation is so-so, but adding Epsom salt and/or essential oil, it does work for a short foot rehab.</li>
    <li> This foot spa was very reasonably priced and I was looking for one just like this. My feet feel great and it&#x27;s a great way to relax after a long day. The motor is a little bit noisy, I don&#x27;t mind it personally, but if you are sensitive to noise while trying to relax, you may want to look for something else.</li>
    <li> So, to be clear, I did not get this thinking the heating element would actually maintain the water temperature.  I got it for bubbles and something more comfortable than the rubbermaid container I was previously using for epsom salt foot soaks after runs.  This is perfect.  The bubbles relieve the tension in my feet and ankles.  I can soak for almost an hour when only having to add more hot water once during the soak.  It&#x27;s the perfect way to relax at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I just got this foot spa today. So far, I LOVE it! The bubbling does not get water on the floor. You CAN use oils in the water. The instructions say you MUST wash the basin with a little gentle soap, rinse well and dry if you add oils to the water. You shouldn&#x27;t add water above the fill line. With the water at the fill line, the water came halfway up my ankle bones (I&#x27;m a 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; female). THIS SPA DOES NOT HEAT THE WATER. You must put hot water in the spa, set it on the floor, sit down and put your feet in, then press the On/Off button. The heater keeps the water warm.  Instructions say not to run the spa more than 20 minutes because it will burn out the motor. The manufacturer recommends 10 minutes because that&#x27;s enough time to relax and refresh your feet. I set a timer for 15 minutes and by that time, I was ready to get my feet out. Some people have asked if a man&#x27;s size 13 foot would fit in the spa. I measured and the length is 13&amp;#34; and the width at the narrowest point is 4&amp;#34; on each side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the little holes that allow the water to bubble, you should not put epsom salts or other granular products in the spa. I use Pedifix to control toenail fungus. Pedifix is epsom salts with tea tree and peppermint oils and it is FANTASTIC! It smells great, opens your sinuses, soothes your feet AND manages fungus. After 2 days of soaking my feet in a plastic box of hot water and Pedifix, the fungus disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, my foot spa arrived. Instead of adding the Pedifix directly to the spa, I heated a cup of water in the microve and put the Pedifix in the cup to dissolve the granules. Not all of it dissolve so I used a fine sieve while pouring the mixture into the spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no cure for toenail fungus, but you can manage it by using the foot soak with Pedifix. Before soaking, use a nail file/emery board to sand the nails on each affected toe. Really sand, getting to the cuticle and sides of nail beds. Wipe off the dust. Apply teatree oil to each nail after sanding. (Tea tree oil opens up the &amp;#34;pores&amp;#34; in the nail, allowing anti-fungal products to pass through the nail to the nail bed. The fungus lives UNDER the nail.) Let the tea tree oil stay on the nail(s) for about 15 minutes. Then use your foot spa with 1-2 teaspoons of tea tree oil (and peppermint oil, if desired) added to the hot water. Or, add one packet of Pedifix (dissolved as described above) to the hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After soaking in the spa for 15 minutes, dry your feet VERY WELL with a towel. The dry with a warm hair dryer or aird dry for 15 minutes. Apply ProClearz liquid with the brush provided. If possible, do not wear socks, slippers or shoes. (If you soak at night, go to bed and for the nest 8 hours, the fungus is deprived of moisture, which helps kill it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever possible, wear sandals (without socks). If you wear sneakers, buy the mesh kind instead of leather. The mesh allows moisture to escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to use my spa once a day. I&#x27;ll update this post if the unit dies in less than once year. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Very useful for me as I am a teacher and stand all day. It keeps the water warm for a good amount of time and the bubbles are very relaxing.</li>
    <li> This product is sturdy, fits my feet with tons of room to spare, it bubbles just fine but it does not keep the water hot. Maybe around 60 degrees or so, just slightly warmer than room temp. But it does the job of allowing me to soak my feet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Would rate 5 stars if it kept the water hot!</li>
    <li> Really helped my tired aching feet.  Water stays warm enough but does cool down over time.  However the warmth lasted long enough for me to get in the recommended 20 minutes with Epsom salts.  The bubbles felt very nice - every bit as soothing as a salon pedicure.</li>
    <li> Came on time, did not heat water as I thought it should.</li>
    <li> No complaints really. I always remove the splash blocker because it&#x27;s just really an inconvenience for me.</li>
    <li> i work in the yard a lot and dirt always gets into my shoes and on my feet.....well this is a very easy way to keep them clean...even have hubs using it</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, despite the &amp;#34;Smart Heat&amp;#34; label, this unit has NO HEATER. Not sure what the heck Smart Heat is supposed to be, but my water went from soothingly hot and steamy to luke warm in minutes, along w/ the bubbles blowing colder water. Obviously that&#x27;s the opposite of what you want in a foot bath. Considering the time and effort to fill the unit, find your bath salt or whatever, towel and finally drop your feet in, it is so disappointing to within minutes start the cleanup process b/c the water&#x27;s cold. Would try again with a more expensive, quality foot bath.</li>
    <li> Great product and it works really well. PLEASE don&#x27;t pay attention to the reviews which claim that it doesn&#x27;t keep the water hot long enough. It does just fine. You are only supposed to use it for about 15 or 20 minutes and that is about how long the water stays hot. You can always refill it with more hot water and have another soak. That is what I do and afterwards I am fully relaxed and my feet are too!</li>
    <li> bad one. it cannot keep warm and cool very fast</li>
    <li> Makes your feet feel good</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift and the recipient loves it!</li>
    <li> Too few bubbles and not much vibration.</li>
    <li> came on time girlfriend loves it</li>
    <li> It works really good but after just one use my toe nail was messing up n coming off n I do nail n feet myself so I couldn&#x27;t understand why</li>
    <li> My husband got this for me for my birthday and it is wonderful! This is a perfect gift for a tired mother! So relaxing!</li>
    <li> This works well enough. It does keep the water hot/warm for about 10-20 minutes if you start with hot water - no complaints there. But the bumps on the bottom of the tub which are supposed to be massaging are SO prickly. That&#x27;s what I like about it least. You basically can&#x27;t bring your feet to a rest at the bottom with those. Otherwise the bubble action and warmth work well enough.</li>
    <li> Terrible. Its super loud. If you want to have a lawnmower for your feet. This is it</li>
    <li> Garbage. Nothing more than a fish tank bubbler. No heater at all. The air bubbles cool the water to cold within a few minutes. Completely false advertising about the heat?</li>
    <li> Great foot bath/pedicare aid!  I use it once a week to make my feet look great!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, and she loves it. I throw some warm water and epsom salts into this unit and her feet are breathing a sigh of relief.</li>
    <li> My 10 year old son and I argue over who gets to use this foot bath first.  I was wonderful to have over the cold winter and the pedi attachment does wonders to remove dry skin easily.  It is so relaxing and easy to use.  The heater doesn&#x27;t keep the water super hot but does extend the soak time.  I have no issues with it at all and with the ultrasonification motion rather than just water circulation, I am pretty sure it&#x27;s better than the others available at this price.  We love it!!!</li>
    <li> Works great. Love the bubbles.</li>
    <li> gets cold quickly when plugged in.</li>
    <li> Blows bubbles and vibrates.  For the money its nice and works as advertised.</li>
    <li> It keeps the water at the temperature that you put it in the basin.  The vibration is very soothing and The price was also reasonable.</li>
    <li> Works great and you can add Epsom salt without is destroying the unit. Easy to clean and not over priced for what you get.</li>
    <li> This foot spa has many reviews. I&#x27;ll add my experience with it to the collection. It seems well built. It has enough weight to not tip or move too easily on carpet. Those were the favorable comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did NOT keep the water warm at all. I used warm water to begin with as is recommended. By the end of ten minutes the water was lukewarm at best, which seems a short time for such a temperature drop in a reputedly heated unit. I was very disappointed with that. There are little nubs sticking up from the bottom of the tub which I didn&#x27;t think were comfortable. You can ignore them but it would have been better to not have them. The unit made bubbles but they were unimpressive. All said and done, I would not recommend this to anyone. I would probably send it back but I didn&#x27;t keep the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you decide to purchase this foot spa keep the box till you have had a chance to evaluate it, but i&#x27;d recommend skipping it unless you want a lame little foot spa.</li>
    <li> Awesome for pedicure!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a foot bath, it works.  Not much too say.</li>
    <li> big enough for my feet 11 men.  I am not too crazy about the color but it does the job.</li>
    <li> I love my spa!!  It has helped my preggo feet and when I go and dump the water it&#x27;s not to heavy which is my favorite part because I am pregnant so that helps.</li>
    <li> Great bubble action very nice tub great kit that comes with it.</li>
    <li> I used this product once and it did not work. Filled it according to instructions and plugged it in, bubble for a few seconds and then stopped working. Would not recommend this product and i have always had good luck with purchasing through amazon. Very Disappointed.</li>
    <li> great product but I don&#x27;t like having a long cord when emptying the unit</li>
    <li> It does an awesome job. If your water is added hot it keeps it very hot. This is an excellent product. I also bought the bath salts for pain and aching feet.</li>
    <li> I use this every month for my feet.  I bought this to replace another Dr scholls spa that was lost in the flood.</li>
    <li> I only ever put warm water in it and the heating element still burned out in about 5-8 uses</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife as a gift. It seemed to be the best one out there given the price and other reviews. It really didn&#x27;t do much, and as others have mentioned, it does nothing to keep the water warm. So I returned it. But the more expensive ones seem to have the same issues. So either spend big bucks on a jacuzzi, or soak your feet in a hot tub and save your money.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a Christmas gift to a friend.... he has diabetes and uses it regularly and loves it!</li>
    <li> It does not keep the water hot. Other than that it works ok.</li>
    <li> Description states foot spa with jelly soak powder, this product does not contain a jelly soak. slightly more expensive than standard model, but it is just the standard model with zero extras, save your money.</li>
    <li> there is no therapeutic component to this device, it&#x27;s just gives you dress where you going to store this useless  giant, i decided to s&#x3D;tore it in the factory</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to have hot water on your feet, but the vibration is more of a buzz and is sooo not relaxing.</li>
    <li> It holds heat very well as long as you start with warm water! Foot rest on top is very nice. Pumice stone right there is convenient! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> My boy friend loves it. However, it only keeps the water hot for about twenty minutes. Which is fine. By the time it was lukewarm, he was ready to get up.</li>
