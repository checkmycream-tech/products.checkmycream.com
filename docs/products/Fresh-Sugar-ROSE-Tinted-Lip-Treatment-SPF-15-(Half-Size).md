      <li>Delicious, soft and smooth, lightly tinted, beautiful.</li>
      <li>I love love love it!</li>
      <li>Do try the colors at sephora first as I love how it looked on me but my fair skin friend tried it on and it didn&#x27;t look so good.</li>
      <li>I received my package promptly, the item was perfect and was beautifully wrapped and placed inside a delicate jewelry bag with a hand written thank you.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK, very smooth and silky but way overpriced.</li>

      <li>It looks like a free sample.</li>
      <li>I first tried this as a free birthday gift from Sephora and had to buy more when I ran out because I love it so much!  </li>
      <li>Nice color and texture but too soft.  </li>
      <li>The softness helped it glide on smoothly, but I really didn&#x27;t see a huge difference between this and cheaper options like the Baby Lips tinted balms.</li>

      <li>so when I&#x27;ve worn out my Fresh Sugar Rose, I&#x27;m going back to Baby Lips.</li>

      <li>The balm also broke right off at the slightest pressure.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not like most chapsticks where it leaves a white line and dries out quickly.  </li>
      <li>Nice color - not too dark.</li>
      <li>Really protects my lips.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited to finally try it</li>
      <li>The formula of this lip balm is so soft, it broke the first day I got it.</li>
      <li>Over priced, definitely better products like this for less.</li>
      <li>I thought the product was a normal sized lipstick.</li>
      <li>Very soft lip gloss.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth with a little tint of color.  </li>
      <li>It also leaves a natural looking tint without looking like you&#x27;re wearing lipstick.</li>
      <li>This was a complete rip off.</li>
      <li>I still used it until it was completely finished.</li>
      <li>It sat heavily on the surface of my lips and wore away quickly.  </li>

<li> SO sad and disappointing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Keeps my lips moist and kissable!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  It takes the place of lip balm AND lipstick. A swipe of this makes your lips look and feel gorgeous.  And this is coming from a lip gloss addict who owns about 100 glosses, sticks, crayons, tubes, etc.</li>
    <li> I love this lip treatment.  It is so moisturizing and adds a perfect spring, sheer tint.</li>
    <li> I was extremely disappointed in this product..........it was no better than any $$2.99 lip balm from the grocery store.  I was so excited to finally try it and it did not meet any of my expectations.  The balm also broke right off at the slightest pressure.  Would have sent it back but didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle.....will definitely never try any other product from this company,.</li>
    <li> Bought the half to try it out but it was disappointing to say the least. Over priced, definitely better products like this for less.</li>
    <li> Smells delicious, works really well, and it&#x27;s way cheaper than you can find most places! I love love love it!</li>
    <li> This is a tiny sample version of the regular one you can purchase at Sephora. For some reason the quality of this smaller one wasn&#x27;t great so I threw it out.</li>
    <li> I received my package promptly, the item was perfect and was beautifully wrapped and placed inside a delicate jewelry bag with a hand written thank you.  I don&#x27;t write reviews but how thoughtful!! Thank you : )</li>
    <li> Great chapstick.  Goes on smooth with a little tint of color.  My only problem was I was not sent the color advertised.  I had already used it when I realized so I did not bother with sending it back.  I like the product, but would have preferred the color I ordered.</li>
    <li> Delicious, soft and smooth, lightly tinted, beautiful. I am addicted to this stuff. It&#x27;s the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever known &amp;#60;3  I like the ROSE color and the HONEY color the best, they are the most natural and make me look the sweetest.</li>
    <li> I thought the product was a normal sized lipstick. It is enough for a Barbie Doll.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK, very smooth and silky but way overpriced.</li>
    <li> I use this and Carmex. I absolutely love both of them. Do try the colors at sephora first as I love how it looked on me but my fair skin friend tried it on and it didn&#x27;t look so good. The transparent one is not as good as carmex in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This was a complete rip off. It looks like a free sample.</li>
    <li> The formula of this lip balm is so soft, it broke the first day I got it. SO sad and disappointing. I still used it until it was completely finished. The softness helped it glide on smoothly, but I really didn&#x27;t see a huge difference between this and cheaper options like the Baby Lips tinted balms. I did like the color a lot, but not enough to re-purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Great color! Great size!</li>
    <li> This lippy smells fantastic and the color is quite flattering.  Sadly I didn&#x27;t like the feel of it at all.  It sat heavily on the surface of my lips and wore away quickly.  I prefer lippy that does double duty (looks good, feels great), so when I&#x27;ve worn out my Fresh Sugar Rose, I&#x27;m going back to Baby Lips.</li>
    <li> Really protects my lips.  Used it when I went to an outside baseball game.</li>
    <li> I first tried this as a free birthday gift from Sephora and had to buy more when I ran out because I love it so much!  It&#x27;s not like most chapsticks where it leaves a white line and dries out quickly.  It also leaves a natural looking tint without looking like you&#x27;re wearing lipstick.</li>

    <li> Very soft lip gloss. Melts easily. Nice color - not too dark.</li>
