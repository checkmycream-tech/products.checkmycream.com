### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I purchased this magnetic irrigator a couple of weeks ago at Amazon and am very happy that I did.   </li>
      <li>excellent product!!!!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s especially good for those with braces.</li>
      <li>I  even showed it to my dentist who was VERY impressed!  </li>
      <li>If not for that, perfect 5.    </li>
      <li>Wish I could recommend this as it does a very good job otherwise.</li>
      <li>The irrigator is ideal for cleaning bridgework.</li>
      <li>This product is brilliant.  </li>
      <li>I had one &amp; it worked great, but it broke after about 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>Great product, makes water flossing a breeze.</li>
      <li>I use it in conjunction with dental floss, and my teeth feel great afterwards.      </li>
      <li>It seemed like a great device.  </li>
      <li>and I remain quite happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
      <li>Materials are of good quality and I have used it successfully for six months.  </li>
      <li>I wish they&#x27;d make it with good quality materials</li>
      <li>I think they must&#x27;ve manufactured it using recycled plastic, and that doesn&#x27;t seem like a good idea for something that goes into your mouth.</li>
      <li>lol &#x3D;)    </li>
      <li>This product seemed like a great idea, and it worked fine for a couple weeks.</li>
      <li>It is a nicely made product and not just a hose connected to a tip as some of the others being offered.  </li>
      <li>I liked that I could control the force of the water pressure.  </li>
      <li>The faucet in my apt.</li>
      <li>works very easily...</li>
      <li>This is probably the most effective oral irrigator I have ever seen and so easy to use.  </li>
      <li>These tools will reduce dentist bills and can freshen breath more than you will expect.</li>
      <li>I am getting more and more used to it....</li>
      <li>The weight does make the handle more substantial, though, and keeps it upright on the side of the sink.</li>
      <li>LOVE it.</li>
      <li>This is a fabulous item!  </li>
      <li>I have added one to my children&#x27;s bathroom and they use it regularly and it is especially good with my daughters braces.   </li>
      <li>this product would have received 5 stars if the adapter had worked better.</li>
      <li>Our dentist noticed immediately when we added this wonderful device to our daily dental care.  </li>
      <li>Irrigating with this just feels lovely...</li>
      <li>it will remove any food particles and will leave your teeth and gums healthy.</li>
      <li>Be interesting to see what they do.</li>
      <li>We love this product.  </li>
      <li>I am liking it better all the time.</li>
      <li>and my dentist said my teeth look the best they have in a long time.  </li>
      <li>I have noticed a significant reduction in tartar!  </li>
      <li>It connects so easily to the faucet and it seems so much more hygienic than others who use water containers.  </li>
      <li>I like the lack of a reservoir - not having one makes it so easy to use, and more sanitary.  </li>
      <li>Very cool.</li>
      <li>I was looking for an oral irrigator to clean the space between my gum line and the top of my bridge.  </li>
      <li>Amazon did not make the return easy.</li>
      <li>It does not come with huge volumes of literature...</li>
      <li>I was hoping that every faucet tip is not as securely attached as the one at my in-laws.</li>
      <li>I would never use anything that needed to be filled nightly.  </li>
      <li>Easy, clean and efficient.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this product 5 months ago, but up to now i still can&#x27;t find an attachment that fit my faucet.</li>
      <li>My husband has attached it without adapters which are available in the box.</li>
      <li>After two Hydrofloss irrigators, recommended by my dentist, I found this item far superior.  </li>
      <li>Cleans well between teeth, but I don&#x27;t find this very useful since I floss.  </li>
      <li>I use this for the first time, and really satisfied with the performance.</li>
      <li>Finally wore the original one out and were delighted to find it available on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>As far as the function, it worked ok the one time I was able to use it.</li>
      <li>Leaves my teeth feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had my Glacier Floss for only a week, but am thoroughly impressed so far.  </li>
      <li>I  purchased the Glacier Floss - no resevoir to fill or clean, no electricity needed.</li>
      <li>I can not say for sure how much this is to do with the Glacier Floss as I started a multipronged approach to improve my dental hygiene at the time I purchased this device.  </li>
      <li>My dentist was really pleased on my last visit, no 5&#x27;s in the pressure test, mostly 2&#x27;s and no 3&#x27;s around my gums.</li>
      <li>Nice and clean nothing to grow mold or bacteria in like the last one I had.</li>
      <li>This is soundless-works great but does feel different since it is a steady stream and not pulses.  </li>
      <li>in general this is a good product that works very well.</li>
      <li>First time I&#x27;ve ever heard that!</li>
      <li>The new one worked great and over a year later, still does.</li>
      <li>Installation is easy as pie on most standard faucets.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive teeth, and I love how you can adjust the water temp and pressure.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>This water is fresh from the faucet.  </li>
      <li>unlike the tank systems because it&#x27;s right there</li>
      <li>so you&#x27;re able to use the faucet normally without taking this off, but it&#x27;s ready to go and do we make use of it.  </li>
      <li>The product was also easy to install, and there are no leaks so far.  </li>
      <li>The first delivery was very fast and now I doubt that they send replacement.</li>
      <li>I actually USE it &#x3D;)))</li>
      <li>First one I dropped in the sink.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll want to start off on very low pressure till your gums get used to it, but now, I keep that baby on full blast to clean my chompers.  </li>
      <li>It is a great little device, simple to install and efficient for flushing debris and flossing.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s ready to go.    </li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t really expect that much from a portable unit.     </li>
      <li>I believe these magnets really are helping to remove plaque</li>
      <li>Delivery was very fast.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Man it was much cheaper on ebay when I bought mine.</li>
      <li>I am very dissatisfied.</li>
      <li>Really helps get things that flossing might have missed.</li>
      <li>I plan to get several more years out of both the new G. F. and the old one, once I have made the repair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought this item solely because I needed a portable oral irrigator, which allows me to use as much water as I need without refilling the water supply (which would normally be 3-4 times with my countertop unit)     I have been staying with family longer than anticipated, so I made the mistake of not bringing my countertop oral irrigator from home.    </li>
      <li>However, that may just be the particular faucet that I used.    </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a shame that I cannot recommend it, as I had high hopes for it.</li>
      <li>I believe this stream of water could pierce skin if set too high.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended to all those who care about dental hygiene.  </li>
      <li>I also highly recommend the Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
      <li>This is one of the few gadgety purchases I have made that is really worthwhile.</li>
      <li>Only reason it doesn&#x27;t get a 5 cause the first one did break.</li>
      <li>The only limitation is that you can&#x27;t mix in peroxide or mouthwash, but since that is apparently not good for the pumps in the reservior type irrigators it may not be a good idea anyway.  </li>
      <li>If they would only beef up the part where the tip attaches this would be a pure winner.</li>
      <li>decided to dissect the old one and found that the coiled tube runs continuously from the faucet adapter to the tip of the handle.</li>
      <li>It tastes like old detergent bottles and, frankly, a bit like garbage.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used one of these for several years now and really like it.</li>
      <li>It is very convenient and simple to use it.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
      <li>This is something that supposedly can&#x27;t be done without going to a dental professional and having them scrape and use ultrasonic cleaners.  </li>
      <li>...but other than that, and the fact that it really obstructs the faucet, it&#x27;s a pretty cool little tool, and I&#x27;m still using it when I can&#x27;t get to the better irrigator in the other bathroom, though I grumble about the awkwardness of the part that hangs down from the faucet,</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this product would have received 5 stars if the adapter had worked better. the only way i could get it to attach to my faucet was to purchase a thinner washer to use with the adapter. as mentioned in an earlier review the plastic threads would not gain purchase.    maybe the magnets in this oral irrigator increase it&#x27;s efficiency, but who knows? how could anyone possibly measure the results? my guess is that it&#x27;s just a unsubstantiated claim.   in general this is a good product that works very well. it will remove any food particles and will leave your teeth and gums healthy. just purchase the 25 cent washer to attach the unit.</li>
    <li> This product seemed like a great idea, and it worked fine for a couple weeks. Then it started leaking out the side. Now it&#x27;s worthless. I sent a message to the seller. Be interesting to see what they do. I&#x27;ll follow up with this review and let you know.</li>
    <li> I bought this item solely because I needed a portable oral irrigator, which allows me to use as much water as I need without refilling the water supply (which would normally be 3-4 times with my countertop unit)     I have been staying with family longer than anticipated, so I made the mistake of not bringing my countertop oral irrigator from home.    A wrench had to be used to loosen the faucet tip, where you attach the irrigator. Since I am at someone else&#x27;s home, I can&#x27;t keep asking them to produce a wrench each time I want to use it, and they won&#x27;t allow me to keep the unit attached.    So, when I spent the night at a hotel, I took the device with me. I was hoping that every faucet tip is not as securely attached as the one at my in-laws. No such luck.      Every other hotel (I tested 3 so far) I have been to is the same. My husband travels with me, and even he could not loosen the faucet tips by hand. Unless you are willing to carry a wrench with you, this oral irrigator is not a good choice for portability.    As far as the function, it worked ok the one time I was able to use it. The pressure was so-so but I didn&#x27;t really expect that much from a portable unit.     I had some trouble getting the temperature right. Every time I would switch back to faucet mode, the irrigator would run only cold water afterward, until I turned both spigots off, reopened them, then waited a few seconds. However, that may just be the particular faucet that I used.    In sum, I am unable to use this product. It&#x27;s a shame that I cannot recommend it, as I had high hopes for it.</li>
    <li> ...but other than that, and the fact that it really obstructs the faucet, it&#x27;s a pretty cool little tool, and I&#x27;m still using it when I can&#x27;t get to the better irrigator in the other bathroom, though I grumble about the awkwardness of the part that hangs down from the faucet, and about the off taste of the water that comes through the irrigator. My spouse won&#x27;t use it for that reason. I think they must&#x27;ve manufactured it using recycled plastic, and that doesn&#x27;t seem like a good idea for something that goes into your mouth. It tastes like old detergent bottles and, frankly, a bit like garbage. I have to rinse my mouth out a lot after using it.  I wish they&#x27;d make it with good quality materials and then it&#x27;d be winner.</li>
    <li> This is probably the most effective oral irrigator I have ever seen and so easy to use.  It connects so easily to the faucet and it seems so much more hygienic than others who use water containers.  This water is fresh from the faucet.  I believe these magnets really are helping to remove plaque and my dentist said my teeth look the best they have in a long time.  It is a nicely made product and not just a hose connected to a tip as some of the others being offered.  I have added one to my children&#x27;s bathroom and they use it regularly and it is especially good with my daughters braces.   Even added one to the guest bedroom bathroom.  AAA+++</li>
    <li> This product is brilliant.  I wish I had it long ago. However, if you have a fancy sink faucet it will not fit on it. Also, the plastic adaptor that is included with the kit is useless.  I had to buy a metal adaptor immediately to make this work.  The plastic one just didn&#x27;t even hang on to the threads of the faucet.</li>
    <li> I purchased this magnetic irrigator a couple of weeks ago at Amazon and am very happy that I did.   It works as described in product specifications, and the patented magnetic technology helps to remove plaque and tartar, just like the Hydrofloss machine, which has higher cost and more difficult upkeep than this device.   Highly recommended to all those who care about dental hygiene.  Installation is easy as pie on most standard faucets.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Glacier Floss for only a week, but am thoroughly impressed so far.  I purchased it after yet another [[ASIN:B000063SLR WaterPik WP-60W Personal Dental Water Jet System]] broke (I&#x27;ve gone through several), and I was looking for an alternative to a countertop model.  I looked at some of the other faucet-based oral irrigators (e.g., [[ASIN:B0028OV2S0 RediBreeze, Oral Irrigator]]), but decided on the Glacier Floss instead because of its magnet.  I may write an update to this review after my dentist appointment, if he comments on any reduced plaque or tartar.    I like the lack of a reservoir - not having one makes it so easy to use, and more sanitary.  Even though there is no pulsation, the pressure actually seems stronger than the WaterPik.  I use it in conjunction with dental floss, and my teeth feel great afterwards.      The product was also easy to install, and there are no leaks so far.  Finally, there is NO taste of recycled plastic from this product as another reviewer noted.  I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I had one &amp; it worked great, but it broke after about 2 weeks. I contacted the seller and had to pay a few bucks to get a new one (was about 5-6 bucks S&amp;H, they only covered part of the cost). The new one worked great and over a year later, still does. I sometimes use it twice a day. I got braces and this gets out anything you want it to and the pressure is insane given that it&#x27;s controlled by your faucet and goes down to a tiny spray.  You&#x27;ll want to start off on very low pressure till your gums get used to it, but now, I keep that baby on full blast to clean my chompers.  Only reason it doesn&#x27;t get a 5 cause the first one did break. If not for that, perfect 5.    Oh, and my dentist complimented me on my gums. First time I&#x27;ve ever heard that!</li>
    <li> I tried to receive replacement, but they haven&#x27;t sent it. I wrote to them, but they said that they have sent. It is a deceit! The first delivery was very fast and now I doubt that they send replacement. They don&#x27;t do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bridgework.  The irrigator is ideal for cleaning bridgework. It is valid so. It is very convenient and simple to use it.&lt;br /&gt;1) Delivery was very fast.&lt;br /&gt;2) My husband has attached it without adapters which are available in the box. Then there are two jet tips by different colors so my husband and me can use it together. It&#x27;s remarkably.&lt;br /&gt;3) I can do water jet and temperature which I want.&lt;br /&gt;4) This irrigator has no batteries and doesn&#x27;t demand additional charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it home, but also I&#x27;ll take it with myself in travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) &#x27;here is sometimes a water leaking in a joining place between the diverter and the faucet threading.&lt;br /&gt;After three weeks of use the irrigator has broken. Water proceeds everywhere, except jet. I am very dissatisfied. I have written to the seller about my problem and have asked about replacement. Now I wait replacement about one month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)There is no support or a hook to place there the irrigator.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used various varitions over the years until we discovered this one a few years ago.  Finally wore the original one out and were delighted to find it available on Amazon.  The strongest points that come to mind is it&#x27;s power, efficiency, Quietness and that we can adjust the water pressure and water temperture.  We have a spare bathroom where we keep it connected all the time.  There is a lever so you&#x27;re able to use the faucet normally without taking this off, but it&#x27;s ready to go and do we make use of it.  Our dentist noticed immediately when we added this wonderful device to our daily dental care.  LOVE it.</li>
    <li> After two Hydrofloss irrigators, recommended by my dentist, I found this item far superior.  Both Hydrofloss pumps failed with less than six months of use.  Took it apart--cheap pump.  The Glacier Floss relies on home water pressure, which is very adequate, saving parts prone to failure.  Materials are of good quality and I have used it successfully for six months.  And, it&#x27;s half the price!  The only limitation is that you can&#x27;t mix in peroxide or mouthwash, but since that is apparently not good for the pumps in the reservior type irrigators it may not be a good idea anyway.  Oh, and of course, it&#x27;s permanently attached to your faucet, but far less cluttering than the reservior style like the Hydrofloss on you sink.  UPDATE: Having previously bought replacement tips from the manufacturer, I find that it is no longer possible to contact them (website gone, numbers disconnected, no web search results). While their tips last several year their device last much longer, so you&#x27;ll have to toss it or buy another product now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this about 6 weeks and I remain quite happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: No big ugly blue and white plastic container on the countertop,&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Can&#x27;t use mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;  Sometimes water temp does not remain constant from the tap,&lt;br /&gt;  causing uncomfortable hot or cold blasts of water.&lt;br /&gt;But I would still purchase another and recommend it to friends</li>
    <li> This transaction has not gone well. The advertisement gives the impression that this item can be hooked up to your faucet. Not the case, it requires removal of washers. The faucet in my apt. is not adaptable to this. I don&#x27;t know how people can use it for travel purposes.   Amazon did not make the return easy. The site does not work as shown in the video regarding obtaining return mailing labels. I had to spend time finding a contact number for Amazon. Amazon tells me I have to obtain the return mailing labels from the manufacturer. I have contacted the manufacturer and they will not send me return mailing labels. I would like to return this item, but why should I pay for return shipping?</li>
    <li> I ordered this product 5 months ago, but up to now i still can&#x27;t find an attachment that fit my faucet. I went to 4 different hardware stores but with no avail. Can somebody recommend any stores that i can go to use this product?</li>
    <li> It seemed like a great device.  I liked that I could control the force of the water pressure.  I used it for about 6 weeks then the unit that the tip attaches to began to leak at the seams.  It was a small leak at first then the more I used it the worse it got with water spraying all over and no longer having pressure in the tip.  I would buy one again if I could return this one and could be assured it wasn&#x27;t an ongoing problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several oral irrigators over the years but this one surpasses all of them.  This was the first to attach directly to the sink so no more tank running dry, no more cleaning tanks, no moving parts to break down.  I actually USE it &#x3D;))) unlike the tank systems because it&#x27;s right there and all I have to do is turn on the water and it&#x27;s ready to go.    I have noticed a significant reduction in tartar!  This is something that supposedly can&#x27;t be done without going to a dental professional and having them scrape and use ultrasonic cleaners.  I can not say for sure how much this is to do with the Glacier Floss as I started a multipronged approach to improve my dental hygiene at the time I purchased this device.  I have however read the study which indicates that magnetized water is an improvement for irrigating. This is not the device that was used in the study however having seen the cutaway pics of both they appear to have the same basic construction to magnetize the water.    Irrigating with this just feels lovely...almost addictive lol &#x3D;)    One thing to note is that I did not get a tracking number. Don&#x27;t worry...when they say they have sent the product...they have.  It is small enough to fit in the tiniest of mailboxes (mine) and mine arrived in a timely manner same as anything I was tracking.    It was simple to install...came with a variety of adapters which I don&#x27;t know exactly who would need when because my faucet is standard, but if yours isn&#x27;t there is probably an adapter for yours included unless your faucet is extremely odd.  It does not come with huge volumes of literature...it is such a simple device it&#x27;s intuitive...hook it up and use it.</li>
    <li> Got this to use in the other bathroom - my pulsating irrigator makes a lot of noise and has been known to wake people in the house up.  This is soundless-works great but does feel different since it is a steady stream and not pulses.  I give give it pluses - the only con is the attacment that fits into the faucet is about 2 inches.  My faucet was low in the sink basin to begin with and how there is only 5 inches clearance between the faucet and sink bottom.  This would not deter me from purchasing this item again.  I would change the faucet out rather than not have this item.  I also got mine on eBay for much less $$ and shipping.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few gadgety purchases I have made that is really worthwhile. I have sensitive teeth, and I love how you can adjust the water temp and pressure. I have 3 bridges and this really gets all the left behind bits out. My dentist was really pleased on my last visit, no 5&#x27;s in the pressure test, mostly 2&#x27;s and no 3&#x27;s around my gums. I had no problems installing this, the instructions are clear standard American English.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used one of these for several years now and really like it. It is so convenient.  Really helps get things that flossing might have missed.You should still floss also.  Man it was much cheaper on ebay when I bought mine. Dont see one for sale there now.</li>
    <li> No quality control, recd damaged unit. Adapter provided by Glacier are hard to insert because of length or width, I need to buy adapter from Standard Lumber.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous item!  Gone is the mess of the WaterPik all over my bathroom counter. No more portable Panasonic to fill and leak!  I  even showed it to my dentist who was VERY impressed!  I would give this 10 stars if I could !!!!</li>
    <li> I use this for the first time, and really satisfied with the performance. Like it a lot because no power needed to operate, unlike any other waterpik, for the water pressure adjustment simply turn the faucet for pressure preference. Very cool.</li>
    <li> I am getting more and more used to it....works very easily...I am liking it better all the time. Nice and clean nothing to grow mold or bacteria in like the last one I had.</li>
    <li> pressure depends on whats coming out of your tap!</li>
    <li> We love this product.  Your teeth feel like they were just cleaned by the dentist every night.  You don&#x27;t have to worry about filling or cleaning the tank. I have given one to all my children, and grandchildren.  It&#x27;s especially good for those with braces.</li>
    <li> The product works well, but it came with no instructions for use or maintenance.  Also, there was no contact information should service be necessary.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t hooked it up yet.  It has to wait till I can find someone to do it for me</li>
    <li> Cleans well between teeth, but I don&#x27;t find this very useful since I floss.  Must be careful to turn lever when done or water will spray all over bathroom</li>
    <li> I was looking for an oral irrigator to clean the space between my gum line and the top of my bridge.  We have a small counter space in our bathroom so I  was looking for a simple device with lots of power.  Well, the Glacier Floss Dental Oral Irrigator fulfilled  both of those criteria.  It is a great little device, simple to install and efficient for flushing debris and flossing.  I would recommend this product without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Great product, makes water flossing a breeze.</li>
    <li> Leaks and doesn&#x27;t work on all faucets, Had to go out of town and didn&#x27;t use it at all and missied the return date.</li>
    <li> I like having non electric oral irrigator.  It can be kept cleaner and fits all size faucets.  I use in the washroom sink and find it handier to remember using it.</li>
    <li> excellent product!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm.  Leaves my teeth feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> Disappointed!! I ordered it and it was defective! The connection that goes in the faucet could not get tight and it was impossible for the water to flow from the flosser. I was hard to get contact to the seller, by email only. The asked me to return it and he would check it. I&#x27;m not going to pay shipping, again</li>
    <li> I was diagnosed with periodontal disease several years ago. Surgery was recommended as well as the use of an oral irrigator. I  purchased the Glacier Floss - no resevoir to fill or clean, no electricity needed. It has worked well, it has kept the surgery at bay and I haven&#x27;t had a cavity since installing this. I use it every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A month ago the kids tried to fill a water balloon with it and it began leaking, no pressure at the tip and water leaking from the seams of the handle. I purchased another and installed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to dissect the old one and found that the coiled tube runs continuously from the faucet adapter to the tip of the handle. The coil passes through a series of magnets inside the handle, but I don&#x27;t believe these magnets have any influence on the effectiveness of this irrigator. The weight does make the handle more substantial, though, and keeps it upright on the side of the sink. Once inside the handle I could see that the only problem was that the tube had slipped of the nipple at the tip of the handle.  I will carefully glue the tube back in place and put this in the children&#x27;s bathroom. I plan to get several more years out of both the new G. F. and the old one, once I have made the repair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see that some others have had a similar leaking problem with the Glacier Floss. I recommend that you slow the water coming from the faucet to a light trickle then adjust the flow at the faucet adapter allowing some water to continue flowing from the faucet. The tip allows only a very small stream of water, but at substantial pressure. I believe this stream of water could pierce skin if set too high. excessive pressure from an attempt to increase water flow can also cause the tube to separate from the tip on the inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To install, you will need basic mechanical skills, a faucet with a removable areator and a pair of pliers, but installation should take about 10 minutes. I didn&#x27;t use teflon tape and there are no leaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend that everyone use an oral irrigator, and the Glacier Floss has served me well. I also highly recommend the Sonicare toothbrush. These tools will reduce dentist bills and can freshen breath more than you will expect. My wife agrees.</li>
    <li> Easy, clean and efficient.  Worth every penny. I would never use anything that needed to be filled nightly.  Turn water on, set temp and go.  My only wish was that it offered different colors, like bronze to match my bath.</li>
    <li> I must like these as I&#x27;ve owned three over a period of maybe ten years. Problem is they always break where the tip screws into the handle. First one I dropped in the sink. Second one fell over. I&#x27;ve been very careful with the third one but the tip just broke off for no apparent reason. Wish I could recommend this as it does a very good job otherwise. If they would only beef up the part where the tip attaches this would be a pure winner. As it is it is designed to fail.</li>
