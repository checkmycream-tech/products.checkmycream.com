### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Took very good care of it and followed directions on how to do so.</li>
      <li>Loved this product!</li>
      <li>I often wear it in a braid on the side-looks great.  </li>
      <li>LOVE my extensions, perfectly blended with my hair</li>
      <li>I like the idea of this product and it looks good on me.</li>
      <li>Luckily, it even matched my hair perfectly.  </li>
      <li>I just wish the manufacturer would add more hair so you don&#x27;t need more than 1 because the design is brilliant.  </li>
      <li>Glad I bought it!</li>
      <li>but I think I will be ordering more!  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
      <li>and I even ordered more for an ombre look!</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>Documentation does say that the hair extensions can be curled, but I don&#x27;t own a curling iron to try that.</li>
      <li>However, since my hair is already on the longer side, the extensions meshed well and looked nice.  </li>
      <li>, I have volume in my own hair and still the piece shows.</li>
      <li>received a sample of this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
      <li>sample was provided in exchange for a honest review.</li>
      <li>Therefore, the headband hair did not &amp;#34;mix&amp;#34; with my own.</li>
      <li>I would pay more$$ for more hair!</li>
      <li>Looking at someone straight on, it looks very good.</li>
      <li>Even though it is synthetic the fair feels and looks pretty good.</li>
      <li>I would have liked to see more volume and more length to them.  </li>
      <li>I got medium blonde and it matched my hair almost perfectly.  </li>
      <li>The hair felt okay to touch.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love them.</li>
      <li>Also, with all three on it looks semi ok</li>
      <li>and I hope you get labeled for the scamming cheap company you are!</li>
      <li>I found that 1 extensions worked well for me but 2 extensions made my look even more noticeable.</li>
      <li>Halo has more hair.</li>
      <li>My concern with the clip on ones is that the weight of the clip and the hair clipped to my thinning hair is just going to pull more of it out.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure your hair stylist will help you with your look.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to order another one for more volume.</li>
      <li>I have bought so many extensions and these are my favorite.</li>
      <li>I wish they were made better</li>
      <li>I could go to the hair store and make something better</li>
      <li>VERY DISSAPOINTED!!!!</li>
      <li>One good thing about it is it matches my hair exactly.</li>
      <li>I like the fact that it is on a headband and is more comfortable to wear than the clip on hair extensions.  </li>
      <li>The color matching wasn&#x27;t easy.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, blend with your hair, and style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you had hair like mine you would like anything that works,is comfortable, affordable and easy.  </li>
      <li>Not platinum, but still quite light.</li>
      <li>I received this product free in exchange for writing a review.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is lighter and completely comfortable.</li>
      <li>These lay completely smooth.</li>
      <li>and they look very nice!!&amp;#34; and cute i love them&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>me these are better than the clip on extensions because it slips right on and there is not bump to side</li>
      <li>, right? :)</li>
      <li>hair piece would work best for the ladies who have long straight hair.</li>
      <li>I think its great that people with long hair want added volume, but its not advertised for volume it advertised as an extension.</li>
      <li>the colors don&#x27;t match your original  hair color.</li>
      <li>i was really excited about it when i ordered them.</li>
      <li>One is really sufficient for me to notice a difference, but I do have very fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Do it right, and no one will know you&#x27;re wearing it!</li>
      <li>It looked great at first though the headband that holds it on was about 2 inches too big</li>
      <li>I was very happy with it for the first few days.</li>
      <li>It is so simple to use and adds gorgeous volume to your hair.</li>
      <li>Really makes your hair look fabulous!</li>
      <li>I would rather go with full extensions or a wig.</li>
      <li>honestly, i cannot imagine anyone in a clear mind wear this flimsy piece of ....</li>
      <li>Overall, I really liked these extensions and found them to easy to</li>
      <li>Maybe I was lucky</li>
      <li>but they first offeredto send another free</li>
      <li>The rubber band feels pretty comfortable.</li>
      <li>i did order a hair peice and if it does not look good with my grey blen</li>
      <li>If I had to say overall the extensions look good on longed straight hair</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a quick way to add volume or length I highly recommend these!!</li>
      <li>you can if you have the right tools and time.</li>
      <li>I could not brush it with all the right brushes</li>
      <li>I ordered two dark blonde and they matched perfect.  </li>
      <li>My hair is already long, so the extensions blend nicely.</li>
      <li>The package includes a nice styling guide, which covers how to brush the hair, how to curl it, how to style it into a pony tail, how to wear more than one secret extension at a time, and how to clean hair extensions.</li>
      <li>The material has the look and feel of real hair and the color is better than some natural hair extensions that have been dyed.  </li>
      <li>The hair looks super real and you can&#x27;t even tell that I&#x27;m wearing extensions.  </li>
      <li>I would have to wear all three of them at the exact same time for it to even look kind of real.</li>
      <li>If you aren&#x27;t fond of the super long hair you can cut them to be a better  length of your choice.</li>
      <li>Very Very Disapointed with this product...</li>
      <li>I received the product for free to test and felt that it was a great concept, but the texture of the hair does not blend well at all and the color on the website is typically darker than what actually arrives.</li>
      <li>Real hair extensions come in a clip form, and many other forms and are becoming much more reasonably priced and last forever so long as you treat them nice.</li>
      <li>, finally was able to come pretty close to mine.</li>
      <li>And, the amount of hair on the product was pretty skimpy, not at all like it looks in the advertising.  </li>
      <li>You can absolutely see the line over the top of your head where the clear band goes, it is no secret.  </li>
      <li>THIS HIGHER THAN 1 START.  </li>
      <li>given that the material is pretty inexpensive, they should have doubled the amount of hair included.</li>
      <li>It is easy to put on, stays in place, and even my husband was shocked at how great it looks!</li>
      <li>Plus the light golden blonde color didn&#x27;t even match with my hair.</li>
      <li>You know when you first buy Barbie her hair is super shiny and soft, but as it gets played with it soon becomes a tangled dread lock</li>
      <li>Invest in good extensions and don&#x27;t waste your money on this!</li>
      <li>It took a few minutes to put them in the first time, but once I got the hang of it, it was fairly easy and quick.  </li>
      <li>Also the elastic band shows on top of your head even if you do not look carefully.</li>
      <li>what really matters is what you see on the video</li>
      <li>It really does look and feel like real hair.</li>
      <li>But I always have to have straight hair bcuz it won&#x27;t curl.</li>
      <li>very good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>whereas there is such an aboundance of clip on extesions providing you with secure feel.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to take it to the salon with me next time and see if she could get it to look more natural.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s too good to be true, it usually is.&amp;#34; definitely applies with this product.</li>
      <li>I did not curl it and live in a pretty high humidity area where it does get all that hot.</li>
      <li>I would have much preferred to spend about $100 ($20 more than these cheap horrible things) on good extensions and have them put in than have bought these things!</li>
      <li>You must be much taller than other people that they don&#x27;t see the top of your head, then they see the underband of course.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are HORRIBLE!!! I bought one my hair color, one blue, and one purple! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND JUST BUY QUALITY MADE EXTENSIONS INSTEAD!!!! For all three including sales tax it cost a little over $80. These are NOT ANYTHING like they are advertised on television or on the website!!! Once I got them I noticed they are just a super thin little line of hair! I would have to wear all three of them at the exact same time for it to even look kind of real. I can wear the colored ones as just a slight peek-a-boo coloring but these DO NOT add volume or are they enough to look like real hair as they are SUPER thin!!! I am SO UPSET that I spent over $80 for these crappy cheap made hair extensions. Also, with all three on it looks semi ok but they are still super thin and even though the clear headbands are clear with all three on you can see them and the hair feels so heavy I was constantly worried about it coming off!!! I am not happy with this at all and I will be posting reviews on every site I find that has these as they are a waste of money and I wish someone had saved me from buying all these terrible cheap &amp;#34;extensions&amp;#34;. I would have much preferred to spend about $100 ($20 more than these cheap horrible things) on good extensions and have them put in than have bought these things! This company is a JOKE and they should be in trouble for FALSE advertising because that is all they have done and they are ripping people off! You should be ashamed of yourself and I hope you get labeled for the scamming cheap company you are!</li>
    <li> I agree with many who posted opinion that one set of extensions is extremely thin and not nearly enough to create a look, and that they do not have a variety of blended colors to match, only few very basic ones.  I went back and forth 3 times trying to match my color, finally was able to come pretty close to mine. my hairdresser attached it and i went to a party.  it was too late for me to remove them and i was tormented entire time by extensions bouncing up and down my scalp and not being sturdy. honestly, i cannot imagine anyone in a clear mind wear this flimsy piece of .... whereas there is such an aboundance of clip on extesions providing you with secure feel.</li>
    <li> LOVE my extensions, perfectly blended with my hair and I even ordered more for an ombre look! The band stayed in place and was completely invisible! I found that 1 extensions worked well for me but 2 extensions made my look even more noticeable.</li>
    <li> Product is a scam! Broke in half when my daughter was putting it on as instructed.</li>
    <li> Overall, I had mixed feelings with this product, plan to continue using it but do not think it was worth the price. When there becomes a need for a replacement I do not think I will order again unless the price drops significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long straight hair which is very fine and goes halfway down my back. The extensions actually ended up not being noticeably a different length or color from my natural hair. Luckily, I had ordered because I wanted extra volume rather than extra length. They also felt exactly like my natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problems I had were not with how it looked, but with how difficult it was to wear and how it felt. I put it on as instructed and the band was obviously noticeable. The band covering your hair is black and the band that goes across your forehead is clear. I had to pull ALL of my natural hair through the headband before it was covered. Therefore, the headband hair did not &amp;#34;mix&amp;#34; with my own. Even with all my hair covering the band, if you look carefully the headband could still be seen around my ears--probably because I have fine hair, the same trait which makes the headband hair actually feel like my own. Another problem I had was with wearing it out in public. The hair got tangled and I could not brush it with even a CHILD brush because the hair would fall out. I did use the proper method to brush it as instructed, the hairs were just not as firmly implanted in the headband as they should be. This lead to me deciding not to brush it (as I did not want the extensions to be half gone after just three days of wearing), but the tangles caused too much volume to my hair and it &amp;#34;poofed&amp;#34; out a bit--shortening the extensions by an inch or two and making my hair look a little odd if you stared at it.</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews and have to admit I was a little skeptical but I was so pleasantly surprised. The hair looks super real and you can&#x27;t even tell that I&#x27;m wearing extensions.  Give this product a try.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how realistic the material was. It really does look and feel like real hair. My hair is really blonde. Not platinum, but still quite light. I got the medium golden blonde, and I was afraid that it would be too dark, but it actually matches really well. My hair is already long, so the extensions blend nicely. If you have short hair though, you&#x27;ll definitely want to cut it. Otherwise, it&#x27;ll be obvious that there are two different lengths. The product provides volume, but it&#x27;s not a super thick layer of material. It&#x27;s easy to apply, blend with your hair, and style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product in exchange for an honest review. I was not paid or told what to write.</li>
    <li> Will not curl like promised. I have a professional curling iron and Ute cannot make any curl in this extension. The hair falls out in massive amounts. My boyfriend and I are constantly pulling loose and hairs that fell out off of me and himself. Kinda embarrassing.  The color matches spot on to my hair. But I always have to have straight hair bcuz it won&#x27;t curl.</li>
    <li> I like these but definitely need 2 or 3. I wear it frequently and get a lot of compliments. I&#x27;m going to order another one for more volume. If you had hair like mine you would like anything that works,is comfortable, affordable and easy.  I often wear it in a braid on the side-looks great.  I just wish the manufacturer would add more hair so you don&#x27;t need more than 1 because the design is brilliant.  I would pay more$$ for more hair! Also get rid of the white plastic piece on each side -sometimes it shows. Why can&#x27;t it be a natural color?</li>
    <li> Rediculous! So Thin You would need to buy 3! Looks nothing like they advertise! Waste of money! I only gave one star because I had to!</li>
    <li> After reading a few reviews here (after I had already ordered) I was prepared not to like these&#x27;ll star.  I start by saying that they probably won&#x27;t work for everyone but here is what I have if it makes it easier to decide.  I have very fine straight hair to almost the middle of my back.  It is dishwater blond and has a about four inches on the end with some highlights left from 3 years ago.  I also have some grey coming in topside.  I ordered the dark blond and it is a spot on match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The initial curl didn&#x27;t work on my straight hair and made for a tangled mess and they looked shorter than my hair, but I used a flat iron (just a few seconds worth) and the curl came right out and when I put them in the second time it was love at second sight! The material has the look and feel of real hair and the color is better than some natural hair extensions that have been dyed.  Maybe I was lucky but I cannot tell where my hair end and these begin other than that my hair is frizzy and these are not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me these are better than the clip on extensions because it slips right on and there is not bump to side it lies flatter on my head.  My concern with the clip on ones is that the weight of the clip and the hair clipped to my thinning hair is just going to pull more of it out.  One is really sufficient for me to notice a difference, but I do have very fine hair.  I haven&#x27;t had them long enough to see how they wear with time but I think I will be ordering more!  I do think they are rather expensive for the amount of hair, I got a set of human hair extensions at Sally for just a little more that had twice the amount of hair.  My next trick will be to get some extensions without clips, sew them together and take some fishing line or bead thread from the craft store and fashion my own for less $$, I don&#x27;t think it will be hard to do if I can find the time.</li>
    <li> Poor hair quality. I was very happy with it for the first few days. Took very good care of it and followed directions on how to do so. After a few days the texture changed and the hair started to fall out. Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> AWFUL ! HOW COULD DAISY ENDORSE THIS CRAP PRODUCT?</li>
    <li> I like the idea of this product and it looks good on me. I have purchased about five of these so far.. If I had to say overall the extensions look good on longed straight hair but they don&#x27;t last. The extensions start shedding really bad after about two weeks. I don&#x27;t wear mine everyday and they are still falling apart. You have to wear more than one or it&#x27;ll look too thin and fake. If you don&#x27;t mind spending the money then go for it but the extensions will fall apart. I wish they were made better</li>
    <li> i have fine blonde hair to the middle of my back, the extention is about 2 inches longer. It is easy to put on, stays in place, and even my husband was shocked at how great it looks! I have it in a low ponytail! My son yanked out my hair tie, and didn&#x27;t notice it was extension, until I told him! Do it right, and no one will know you&#x27;re wearing it! The hair isn&#x27;t thick, but at the very least it can add highlights and volume! Glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very thin hair and a third of it already fell out!!!  It&#x27;s over priced!!!  I could not brush it with all the right brushes it all falls out. I ordered a second time thought maybe it would be better but same thing. It needs more hair and something should be done about the hair falling out or lower the price because because you would have to buy them at least once a month!!!!</li>
    <li> i just bougbt mine and they look very nice!!&amp;#34; and cute i love them&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Very Very Disapointed with this product... i have thin hair as it is that is why i Purchased the product... but there is not enough hair on the head band to even start to make a difference in my hair at all... and the hair doesnt come around to the side of your head the hair is made for the back and  STILL NOT ENOUGH HAIR ON EXTENSION BAND TO EVEN CALL THEM EXTENSIONS......  in my case I would need atleast 3 bands to make a differnce,...thats how bad it is............ TOO SAD.. i was really excited about it when i ordered them. WHAT A LET DOWN... :(</li>
    <li> A Junk Product, the piece under your hair shows very well, does not stay straight, it is uncomfortable, very difficult to pull your hair over it. , I have volume in my own hair and still the piece shows. Also the elastic band shows on top of your head even if you do not look carefully. You must be much taller than other people that they don&#x27;t see the top of your head, then they see the underband of course. does not worth it even for much cheaper price. I will return it even if I have to pay S&amp;H.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it is on a headband and is more comfortable to wear than the clip on hair extensions.  Luckily, it even matched my hair perfectly.  My problem with it is the fact that it added absolutely no length to my hair, only added some fullness.  It is asinine that they don&#x27;t offer different lengths to choose from.  They are also completely misrepresenting the product...  Some of the models shows long, luxurious locks that goes to their rib cages.  This is completely misleading, as the extension barely grazes my nipples.  I also dislike they fact that if the band breaks, you are screwed.  They will not send another band to replace it and are just expected to purchase a brand new one.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair, and thought this product was amazing...It looked great at first though the headband that holds it on was about 2 inches too big and so the extension literally hung off my head..but I found ways to help secure it like braiding it in with my hair, a loose fish braid to the side or something.  And because it was to big it went high above my ears on both sides and would occasionally flip so it stuck out like a fan shape around my ears. I fixed this with a couple of tiny bobby pins.  I did not curl it and live in a pretty high humidity area where it does get all that hot. Yet, the hair after only a couple weeks began to feel just like Barbie doll hair. You know when you first buy Barbie her hair is super shiny and soft, but as it gets played with it soon becomes a tangled dread lock, that&#x27;s course and irreparable, well this is what this particular extension does as well. I had only worn it 4 out of 7 days the first week, and less the second week.  I followed the care instructions, however at this point I can&#x27;t even use it. I say save your money on this one, because if you add the cost of replacing this every two weeks (and not wearing it everyday either)..your looking at spending about $80 a month, which is a lot over a year or two. Real hair extensions come in a clip form, and many other forms and are becoming much more reasonably priced and last forever so long as you treat them nice. The old saying &amp;#34;when it&#x27;s too good to be true, it usually is.&amp;#34; definitely applies with this product. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> DONT BUY IT its horrile, fake hair, cheap rubber band that in the first use you cant use the curl wand or iron, cause it gets damaged, i hate it small amount that when you pass an comb the hair gets loosen i cant rated even with 1 star because its horrible</li>
    <li> I had never tried extensions before because they always seemed like they would be too difficult to put in and maintain, so I was eager to try the Secret Extensions.  I got medium blonde and it matched my hair almost perfectly.  The extensions are very soft and feel like real hair.  It took a few minutes to put them in the first time, but once I got the hang of it, it was fairly easy and quick.  Once in, it added some volume and length to my just past the shoulder hair.  The band was not at all uncomfortable on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative about the extensions is that there is not that much hair in the extensions.  I would have liked to see more volume and more length to them.  However, since my hair is already on the longer side, the extensions meshed well and looked nice.  They may not work as well for very short hair.  Overall, I really liked these extensions and found them to easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample was provided in exchange for a honest review.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of the secret extensions; one for myself and one for my niece.  Although not thrilled with it, my niece kept hers because she desperately wanted more hair than she has due to a thinning hair problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned the one I purchase for myself.  You can absolutely see the line over the top of your head where the clear band goes, it is no secret.  The color matching wasn&#x27;t easy.  And it took a long time for the order to arrive, about 4-5 weeks.  And, the amount of hair on the product was pretty skimpy, not at all like it looks in the advertising.  But, WORST OF ALL, I returned my order on 4/20 and didn&#x27;t receive the refund.  When I called to follow-up, they showed the return was received on 4/20 and &amp;#34;didn&#x27;t know&amp;#34; why the refund wasn&#x27;t issued.  They said it would be issued in 3-4 business days.  I wonder, if I didn&#x27;t call would I ever gotten the refund???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would NOT recommend!</li>
    <li> I was quite disappointed with this product. I did a bit of research and found that people over all like it, but lets make a few things clear 1- there is not enough hair on the band, you need two maybe three pieces for it to look like the infomercial. 2- The colors from the site DO NOT match what you get at home. 3- They say you can curl it, yes you can if you have the right tools and time. You need a curling wand and then time to wrap it, pin and let it set. Once curly you can&#x27;t just uncurl it. They say wash it out? Nope, I had to use a flat iron to get it straight again. 4- it looks hideous on if you have short to shoulder length hair. What&#x27;s the point of wearing an extension then? I think its great that people with long hair want added volume, but its not advertised for volume it advertised as an extension. My opinion is steer clear of this if you have hair shorter than mid back length. Mine is a little bit longer than shoulder and when this piece is on it looks like i have cat tail attached to the back of my head. Invest in good extensions and don&#x27;t waste your money on this!</li>
    <li> They are the worst extensions I&#x27;ve ever had. They are incredibly thin and feel fake. For anyone who knows about extensions you will be sadly disappointed.</li>
    <li> A joke for girls with long hair. You&#x27;ll look ridiculous if your hair is longer than the extension and you need like three of them</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t officially tried it on yet, but while playing around with it I ran into the same issues others had. I would have to wear 2 or 3 to get the look that they show on the infomercial. One good thing about it is it matches my hair exactly. I&#x27;m going to take it to the salon with me next time and see if she could get it to look more natural. I always have problems when I get my hair colored. It&#x27;s either too light or too dark. At least I can take this with me to show them exactly what color I want my hair to be.</li>
    <li> Do not Buy!There terrible they wont give all your money back when you return them I have had fused exstions for yrs.and there hardley any hair on them I could go to the hair store and make something better and they dont tell you they only have one lenghth their not even 18inches long their terrible dont waste you time or your money.</li>
    <li> i wanted a hair peice with grey brown blend and when i asked if you may do that in the future she acted like it was a strange request and that would never be thought or sugested to do so. i have RA and take chemo and can&#x27;t color my hair!! i did order a hair peice and if it does not look good with my grey blen I WILL RETURN IT.  YOU SHOULD CONSIDER PEOPLE IN MY SITUATION!  Barbi in texas.</li>
    <li> Loved this product! Really makes your hair look fabulous! All of my friends raved about it! I recommend to all women of every age!</li>
    <li> I received the product for free to test and felt that it was a great concept, but the texture of the hair does not blend well at all and the color on the website is typically darker than what actually arrives.</li>
    <li> I have bought so many extensions and these are my favorite. Others can be too heavy and bulky, causing really fake looking bumps in the back. These lay completely smooth. Take a few minutes to watch the curling and styling tutorials on YouTube. I trimmed mine up a bit, curled it and I love it!</li>
    <li> I love the way my thin hair looks with the extensions on. Hoping they come out with a bleached lightest hair sometime I need 2 sets wen you do!!!</li>
    <li> worst extensions ever once i took it out the box i was shock on how thin and fake it looked wen tried it on hair was falling out like crazy totally waste of money</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:8be13c93a7ec5700e4c2f60ee983f8e7]] This is a clever idea. The hair attaches with a thin rubber band hidden by your own hair. The rubber band feels pretty comfortable. But there was a lot less hair in the extensions than I expected (see my video). It is too bad that the stock photo only shows the model with luxurious hair without showing the hair piece by itself, it sets the wrong expectation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair piece would work best for the ladies who have long straight hair. If you have short hair and you wanted to add extensions that would make it long it does not work. Also if your hair is wavy it would be noticeably different even if you matched the color right. Documentation does say that the hair extensions can be curled, but I don&#x27;t own a curling iron to try that. My hair is fairly short and even though hair color matches well it does not look natural on me because without having the volume of my own long hair it looks too thin to be attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair in extensions is 16\\&quot;. The hair is made out of futara fiber. Even though it is synthetic the fair feels and looks pretty good. Secret Extension web site helped me select the right shade of color. Note that hair extensions cannot be colored once you get them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secret extensions hair piece is easy to put on and the rubber band is pretty gentle, it does not feel uncomfortable. The package includes a nice styling guide, which covers how to brush the hair, how to curl it, how to style it into a pony tail, how to wear more than one secret extension at a time, and how to clean hair extensions. A key piece of information is that the hair extensions should be washed after 5-7 times one wears them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of Secret Extensions for evaluation and an honest review. So, what&#x27;s the bottom line? I thought it might be okay for someone with long hair, even though it was not a good match for me. I like the method for hair attachment. The hair felt okay to touch. The volume of hair is not a good match for a person with short hair. I think it would work for someone with long hair to add some volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia reviewof hair is not a good match for a person with short hair.

    <li> I received this product free in exchange for writing a review. I was not paid or told what to write. I absolutely love this product! It is so simple to use and adds gorgeous volume to your hair. You can even use them in a pony tail. It blends in so well it looks natural. If you&#x27;re looking for a quick way to add volume or length I highly recommend these!!</li>
    <li> I have received a complimentary set of Secret Extensions to facilitate this review.  I have always wanted to have long hair but for some reason mine doesn&#x27;t seem to grow any further than my shoulders.  The Secret Extensions were so easy to use. I  found it helpful to use 2 sets to match the fullness of the rest of my hair.  The colors matched perfectly to my dark brown hair color.  If you aren&#x27;t fond of the super long hair you can cut them to be a better  length of your choice. I&#x27;m sure your hair stylist will help you with your look.  Even though I haven&#x27;t had any problems with  the elastic band slipping off I do like to secure them with a bobby pin behind my ears for that extra security.  I am so happy to use secret extensions for special occasions and for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I just received my Secret extensions today.. and they are just that. Secret, nobody will know. They do not look fake or feel fake at all. I absolutely love them. I have just below shoulder length-layered hair.. I ordered two dark blonde and they matched perfect.  I LUV it.</li>
    <li> Not a good buy and most definitely not worth the money.  There is barely enough hair for a one pigtail.  The ad is extremely deceptive.  I bought a $20 piece at Kmart that had 3 times the amount of hair this product - and got dozens of compliments.</li>
    <li> Looking at someone straight on, it looks very good. But if you look at the side of their head or even the back, you can totally see the extensions and it looks terrible. I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s why they only did front head shots in the infomercial.</li>
    <li> When I got it, it was just a very thin layer of hair, not as thick as it looks in the ads. I was very unhappy with my purchase and it is expensive. Plus the light golden blonde color didn&#x27;t even match with my hair. I called to get a refund but they first offeredto send another free but I would have to pay another $6.99 shipping and when I wanted a refund, they said I am responsible for paying shipping to end it back, no prepay to ship it back for a refund. I spent enough money on this piece of crap and shouldn&#x27;t have to pay for shipping to make it right. I would rather go with full extensions or a wig.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:9a3e6d3aed71caac887fb5d9c010b00c]] I already have long, straight hair, so I wasn&#x27;t looking for a dramatic change in length. I just wanted to add body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasted a ton of money on Halo extensions and hated them... they were itchy, for one thing! There were gray hairs mixed in, and it didn&#x27;t feel right or look right on me. The company didn&#x27;t care and said I must have a \\&quot;scalp problem\\&quot; if it&#x27;s itchy. Nope! I don&#x27;t have any scalp problem. The Halo also thinned out at the bottom whereas this doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered this for review and wondered how it would stack up. Here&#x27;s how it does:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is lighter and completely comfortable. Not itchy at all. Just like wearing a thin headband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s polyester, not real hair, but it looks and feels very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Halo has more hair. That&#x27;s my main complaint about this one-- given that the material is pretty inexpensive, they should have doubled the amount of hair included. You&#x27;re not going to get results like you see in the sample photos with just one extension, though you probably could if you bought two and stacked them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The band on this is black, so it slightly shows against the scalp. The Halo&#x27;s band is clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what really matters is what you see on the video, right? :)</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY!!! NOT ENOUGH HAIR AND IT DOES NOT BLEND WELL, NOT WORTH THE PRICE. NOT SURE WHY PEOPLE ARE RATING THIS HIGHER THAN 1 START.  VERY DISSAPOINTED!!!!</li>
    <li> Definitely not worth buying!!!  Not enough hair to blend in and the colors don&#x27;t match your original  hair color. Very disappointed.</li>
