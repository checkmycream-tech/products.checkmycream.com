      <li>Great product and even greater customer support!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good, but it lasted about a month.</li>
      <li>It is a good product,I have been using it for a while</li>
      <li>, it takes the frizz out, however, my hair are not wash and go, they miss shine, and it is just not as good as from hairdresser...</li>
      <li>Love love love this product!!!</li>
      <li>Again it is me and you might love it!</li>
      <li>but it is ok!</li>
      <li>it was more like orange and to be honest I didnt care!</li>
      <li>Just amazing.</li>
      <li>For the record, I have since re-done the keratin treatment while using my own, non-QOD, aftercare products my hair color has remained stable.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
      <li>have to say, delivery was perfect, on time and very well packed.</li>
      <li>My sister told me \\&quot;it&#x27;s like you put on a nice hair product</li>
      <li>but i find it very easy to do yourself.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t wait until it grows out more</li>
      <li>I love this product</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have it, don&#x27;t do it as you won&#x27;t be able to seal keratin in the hair.</li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t like to smell like food:)</li>
      <li>And it looks even better then after just applying keratin.</li>
      <li>I applied it second time, was a bit better - more experienced, but - still, not as from professional.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It was wash and go for about 2 - 3 months, then easy to maintain for another 6 months at least!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t go to the salon to do it as it could be done easily at home.</li>
      <li>they were very helpful and kind.</li>
      <li>I waited for ttwo weeks and color it again so far so good</li>
      <li>It was fast!!!</li>
      <li>After keratin it will go to your original condition.</li>
      <li>I tried it first time - OK</li>
      <li>It really made my hair silky smooth now it has been two months and still holding cant be more greatful</li>
      <li>I love this product, it has enhanced my hair so much and reduced hair fall noticeably.</li>
      <li>Maybe I was expecting too much from this, which to me seems more of a glorified hair mask rather than a keratin treatment.</li>
      <li>So much for the wash-and-go promises!!</li>
      <li>, product is very sticky, so during my first applying I almost ended up going to hairdresser to shave my hair!</li>
      <li>I am usually able to manage my hair (in Europe), but currently we stay in Asia, in hot and humid environment.</li>
      <li>Got the goods, thanks!</li>
      <li>Followed all instructions exactly.</li>
      <li>When we asked why the company advertises that the product is suitable for grey hair</li>
      <li>Thanks QOD USA!</li>
      <li>It definitely looks and feels better than before.</li>
      <li>When applying the keratin treatment, I worked the product through my ends first, then put some at the scalp/roots and used a comb to evenly distribute the product.  </li>
      <li>Something happen with the formula because the I&#x27;ve previously used these brand before, and the results were amazing .</li>
      <li>but it is really a precaution.</li>
      <li>and  you dont get the straight , shiny hair.</li>
      <li>for.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to buy it and share with friends, as the packaging is very big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Anyway I know that the real judges are my family members and they didn&#x27;t notice any change.</li>
      <li>You really can&#x27;t wash your hair for 48 hours otherwise</li>
      <li>Thanks QOD.</li>
      <li>I dont have to use much product in my hair after washing.  </li>
      <li>regards to applying the keratin treatment, I will say that it came with detailed, broken-English instructions that I largely ignored because they were clearly not from the manufacturer.</li>
      <li>I am Caucasian and have long and frizzy hair, very strong, thick, with no shine (I like to say my hair is like sheep&#x27;s hair :) ).</li>
      <li>I mainly followed the instructions on the bottle.  </li>
      <li>Be cautious- make sure you have personal recommendations and a similar hair type to those it has helped  and think twice before purchasing this pricey</li>
      <li>I had my natural color died over old highlights to get rid of them, and after the first time I used this product my hair was noticeably lighter.  </li>
      <li>it did not hardly do a thing.</li>
      <li>the product went in fine, but as soon as the stylist started using a flat iron to seal the product, it turned her silvery-gray hair a very VIVID shade of mustard yellow!</li>
      <li>With this new formula  </li>
      <li>And although it is lovely and straight,and the condition is somewhat improved it has totally ruined my hair colour, turning my ash blonde into a foul yellow colour.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even need to flat iron any more, only when applying the product do I flat iron.  </li>
      <li>I understand that this formula isn&#x27;t supposed to straighten as much as the older one and supposedly its effect is cumulative, but there&#x27;s no mention of how long the effect lasts and how often can/should it be applied.</li>
      <li>I redid the treatment but this time at a professional hair stylist&#x27;s and now I can say that this DOES work.</li>
      <li>Remember that you hair won&#x27;t be stick straight as after Japanese treatment.</li>
      <li>As far as the fear?</li>
      <li>Well I purchased this direct from QOD.  </li>
      <li>tried Brazilian keratin around 2 years ago by professional during our trip in Australia.</li>
      <li>This product gives a natural look, your hair dose not have a processed look that relaxers and straighteners give.  </li>
      <li>So far I like the results of the QOD Max Keratin Hair Treatment better than those of the Coppola Keratin Complex.</li>
      <li>My hair looks slightly better and feels a little softer but it still frizzes after blow drying and flat ironing.</li>
      <li>have decided to buy a product via amazon (as to travel to HK to see a hairdresser is a bit of celebrity lifestyle as we do not live in HK ;) )</li>
      <li>Maybe it is more suitable for shorter hair, but for my long hair - very difficult to distribute.</li>
      <li>I had never done keratin before, but this enables me to blow dry my hair straight and frizz free, or let it air dry with a loose wave.  </li>
      <li>This product allows me to wear my hair sleek straight when I blow dry.</li>
      <li>and it is straight and wavy on the same head after Japanese treatment.</li>
      <li>final note on formaldehyde: this product says it has no raw formaldehyde, which is probably correct.</li>
      <li>it is not long lasting.</li>
</ol>

<li> My hair has reduced volume after blow drying and flat ironing.</li>
<li> and there that needed to be flat ironed again as it appeared.</li>
<li> Although it is a new generation of keratin and it smells like chocolate it does have a little bit of formaldehyde.</li>
<li> although some have had success with this product on dark hair, we tried to use it on my mother&#x27;s very thick, coarse grey hair today.</li>
<li> I would advise to STAY AWAY if you&#x27;ve got grey hair!</li>
<li> all the other stylists at the salon have been having the same problems after the product has been reformulated.</li>
<li> The treatment does not stay for very long.</li>
<li> Also I tried to just let it air dry</li>
<li> she explained that only a small percentage of people with grey hair have this problem and that the company doesn&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s enough people to change the product information officially.</li>
<li> This is a very expensive product that is supposed to be a better deal than going to the salon.</li>
<li> This is not a relaxer, it just makes the hair looks much better and easy to style, i suggest using anti curl with coarse hair also use hot comb, the worst thing in this product that it is very expensive, because of the daily use for the shampoo and the conditioner, an average payment of $80/month, if you can&#x27;t make this payment monthly don&#x27;t think about this product.\\&quot;</li>
<li> I am african american 4b/4a hair very tight curls.  </li>
<li> Japanese treatment is bad for blond hair and it can fry it easily.</li>
<li> The integrity of my curls has changed from curly/wavy to a very loose wave, so if you are attached to the structure of your curl, this might not be the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
<li> Also, I can go from wet hair to air drying&lt;</li>

    <li> This is not a relaxer, it just makes the hair looks much better and easy to style, i suggest using anti curl with coarse hair also use hot comb, the worst thing in this product that it is very expensive, because of the daily use for the shampoo and the conditioner, an average payment of $80/month, if you can&#x27;t make this payment monthly don&#x27;t think about this product.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have very thin, wavy and frizzy hair. No matter what I do when I go outside it frizzes. So I was hoping this product would eliminate the frizz and it did. I didn&#x27;t go to the salon to do it as it could be done easily at home. To have a 450 degree iron is a must. If you don&#x27;t have it, don&#x27;t do it as you won&#x27;t be able to seal keratin in the hair. It said that I needed to wait 3-4 days but it is really a precaution. I could feel that keratin settled in 1 day as it stopped getting a wave here and there that needed to be flat ironed again as it appeared. I washed hair after 2 days. And it looks even better then after just applying keratin. Remember that you hair won&#x27;t be stick straight as after Japanese treatment. Japanese treatment is bad for blond hair and it can fry it easily. I had it at the salon and my ends were fried.So I had to cut my hair very short. Keratin is good for any hair and the best thing you won&#x27;t look like a fool when your hair starts growing and it is straight and wavy on the same head after Japanese treatment. After keratin it will go to your original condition. The only downfall of this product is the smell. Get the mask as you do it. Although it is a new generation of keratin and it smells like chocolate it does have a little bit of formaldehyde. Companies don&#x27;t say it does but it really has it as the unpleasant smell goes in your nose and eyes can tear. Other then that I smell like chocolate every day as I bought shampoo to go with it. Not sure I will want to smell like chocolate anymore but it is ok! I just have to buy a different shampoo. Again it is me and you might love it! I just don&#x27;t like to smell like food:)</li>
    <li> I bought this product not knowing what it could do.  After reading all reviews I went with this product. The product is great it does what it says it can do.&lt;br /&gt;I have curly and frizzy hair.  This product allows me to wear my hair sleek straight when I blow dry. I don&#x27;t even need to flat iron any more, only when applying the product do I flat iron.  Also, I can go from wet hair to air drying&lt;br /&gt;that is no blow drying and I have curls that do not frizz.  This product gives a natural look, your hair dose not have a processed look that relaxers and straighteners give.  And I have the choice to wear my hair curly or straight.&lt;br /&gt;I will be using this product again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I purchased the QOD max kit and went through the treatment as instructed on the bottle to the tee. I&#x27;m a male with type 3a virgin hair and it&#x27;s about shoulder length, so I used 1 oz (about 30 ml) of the treatment which was just about enough. Honestly, I&#x27;m not very satisfied with the results. My hair looks slightly better and feels a little softer but it still frizzes after blow drying and flat ironing. Also I tried to just let it air dry but it got too frizzy. In fact the only way I can sense any difference is by flat ironing my hair. So much for the wash-and-go promises!! Anyway I know that the real judges are my family members and they didn&#x27;t notice any change. My sister told me \\&quot;it&#x27;s like you put on a nice hair product but didn&#x27;t actually do keratin\\&quot;. I understand that this formula isn&#x27;t supposed to straighten as much as the older one and supposedly its effect is cumulative, but there&#x27;s no mention of how long the effect lasts and how often can/should it be applied. Maybe I was expecting too much from this, which to me seems more of a glorified hair mask rather than a keratin treatment. If my hair is already frizzing after the first wash, I can see myself redoing the treatment in less than a month, which is kinda tedious.  By the way I washed my hair after 8 hours (I slept with a beanie on) and I know it can be washed in like 5-10 min but I&#x27;m confused because I saw somewhere on the Internet people saying they left the treatment on their hair for 2-3 days. Does it help to leave it longer in any way???  I give it a generous 3 out of 5  UPDATE: I redid the treatment but this time at a professional hair stylist&#x27;s and now I can say that this DOES work. My hair has reduced volume after blow drying and flat ironing. It definitely looks and feels better than before. Thanks QOD.</li>
    <li> It really made my hair silky smooth now it has been two months and still holding cant be more greatful but there is one problem actually it changed my hair color it was more like orange and to be honest I didnt care! It saved my hair and me a lot of torture lol. I waited for ttwo weeks and color it again so far so good</li>
    <li> Something happen with the formula because the I&#x27;ve previously used these brand before, and the results were amazing . With this new formula  it does not last and  you dont get the straight , shiny hair. Dont waste your money on these one, ..</li>
    <li> Got the goods, thanks!</li>
    <li> It was fast!!! and an excelent product according to my girlfriend, I bouth this product for her</li>
    <li> So far I like the results of the QOD Max Keratin Hair Treatment better than those of the Coppola Keratin Complex.</li>
    <li> although some have had success with this product on dark hair, we tried to use it on my mother&#x27;s very thick, coarse grey hair today. the product went in fine, but as soon as the stylist started using a flat iron to seal the product, it turned her silvery-gray hair a very VIVID shade of mustard yellow! we called QOD USA&#x27;s customer support line and the representative admitted that she has heard of this happening. When we asked why the company advertises that the product is suitable for grey hair she explained that only a small percentage of people with grey hair have this problem and that the company doesn&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s enough people to change the product information officially. Unfortunately for my mother, she was in the small percentage. I would advise to STAY AWAY if you&#x27;ve got grey hair!</li>
    <li> I am african american 4b/4a hair very tight curls.  I love this product made my hair feel like silk!! loosens curls a lot love it!! I dont have to use much product in my hair after washing.  My hair is shoulder length when straighten can&#x27;t wait until it grows out more cause it will look fabulous!!! Love love love this product!!!</li>
    <li> Great product and even greater customer support! I love this product, it has enhanced my hair so much and reduced hair fall noticeably. I had the session done to me by a pro but i find it very easy to do yourself. I kept it on my hair for 2 days although said for 20 min only. Will keep on using it! QOD USA has a great customer support when i had an inquiry regarding the product shipped to me they were very helpful and kind. Thanks QOD USA!</li>
    <li> First, I sadly have to agree with the other reviewer who said this messed with her hair color.  I had my natural color died over old highlights to get rid of them, and after the first time I used this product my hair was noticeably lighter.  My boyfriend even asked me why I had changed my hair color!  The second time I washed my hair with the aftercare products, my hair got lighter again.  So, I immediately switched to a different shampoo/conditioner,  and ever since my hair color has remained stable.  Therefore, I believe the aftercare products caused the lightening, not the keratin treatment itself.  For the record, I have since re-done the keratin treatment while using my own, non-QOD, aftercare products my hair color has remained stable.&lt;br /&gt;With regards to applying the keratin treatment, I will say that it came with detailed, broken-English instructions that I largely ignored because they were clearly not from the manufacturer. I mainly followed the instructions on the bottle.  When applying the keratin treatment, I worked the product through my ends first, then put some at the scalp/roots and used a comb to evenly distribute the product.  Be careful to use the minimum amount of product possible, or else it will be impossible to blow dry!&lt;br /&gt;The results from this product are great.  I had never done keratin before, but this enables me to blow dry my hair straight and frizz free, or let it air dry with a loose wave.  The integrity of my curls has changed from curly/wavy to a very loose wave, so if you are attached to the structure of your curl, this might not be the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;A final note on formaldehyde: this product says it has no raw formaldehyde, which is probably correct. However, when the chemicals in it are heated they produce formaldehyde.  The odor still exists in my hair weeks/months after the treatment (eww).</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know I used the clarifying shampoo for 5 min and rinsed out. Blowed out hair,applied product combed through and dried. Flat ironed. Looked great made her not wash for four days.Used the shampoo I purchased. Hair still was not as bad but still needs to be flat ironed. What did I do wrong? Only thing I can think of is if the chic iron 450 degrees. Looking into it. Need feed back. She has hair that is ethic curly..Help!!Loved the way it looked before washed.</li>
    <li> It works. I only had my oldest daughter put it on me once, so I have lots of product left, but yeah.. it works. As far as the fear? Eh, I have worse vices.</li>
    <li> Well I purchased this direct from QOD.  Followed all instructions exactly. My hairdresser friend applied it for me. And although it is lovely and straight,and the condition is somewhat improved it has totally ruined my hair colour, turning my ash blonde into a foul yellow colour. It says to used at least 4 days before or after colouring your hair which I did. And when I emailed them for some help for what to do, I got an email back telling me how the product worked and nothing about how to fix it! I emailed again and got no reply. I would say that you should be seriously wary of using it if you have coloured hair, despite their claims. And their customer service is terrible.</li>
    <li> I used this product on a client, followed the instructions perfectly. it did not hardly do a thing. she still has curly/frizzy hair. all the other stylists at the salon have been having the same problems after the product has been reformulated.</li>
    <li> I am Caucasian and have long and frizzy hair, very strong, thick, with no shine (I like to say my hair is like sheep&#x27;s hair :) ). I do not dye or perm my hair - so I guess my hair is a virgin hair. I am usually able to manage my hair (in Europe), but currently we stay in Asia, in hot and humid environment. Disaster for my hair!&lt;br /&gt;I tried Brazilian keratin around 2 years ago by professional during our trip in Australia. Loved it! I had to have it done again in Hong Kong. Then again. Just amazing. My hair was literally wash and go - with health and shine. It was wash and go for about 2 - 3 months, then easy to maintain for another 6 months at least!&lt;br /&gt;I have decided to buy a product via amazon (as to travel to HK to see a hairdresser is a bit of celebrity lifestyle as we do not live in HK ;) ) and QOD had the best reviews. I tried it first time - OK, it takes the frizz out, however, my hair are not wash and go, they miss shine, and it is just not as good as from hairdresser...&lt;br /&gt;Also, product is very sticky, so during my first applying I almost ended up going to hairdresser to shave my hair! It was just all glued together, impossible to deal with it. Lost lot of hair during applying the product. Maybe it is more suitable for shorter hair, but for my long hair - very difficult to distribute. The treatment does not stay for very long. I applied it second time, was a bit better - more experienced, but - still, not as from professional.&lt;br /&gt;I will (probably) finish the product, but will not buy it again. Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair type what it is not suitable for.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to buy it and share with friends, as the packaging is very big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, delivery was perfect, on time and very well packed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, but it lasted about a month. You really can&#x27;t wash your hair for 48 hours otherwise it is not long lasting.</li>
    <li> This is a very expensive product that is supposed to be a better deal than going to the salon. However, the instructions don&#x27;t lead you to the desired result and though this product may work wonders on some peoples hair, it can damage others. Be cautious- make sure you have personal recommendations and a similar hair type to those it has helped  and think twice before purchasing this pricey product.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the overpriced shampoo and conditioner can be bought at any local pharmacy for a fraction of the price under a different brand name.</li>
    <li> It is a good product,I have been using it for a while I didnt have any problem.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Latfa.</li>
