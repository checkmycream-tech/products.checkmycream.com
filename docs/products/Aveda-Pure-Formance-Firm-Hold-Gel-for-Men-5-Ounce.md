      <li>Soup to nuts, its that good.  </li>
      <li>Once in my hair, my hair remains style-able for a good 15-20 minutes, but won&#x27;t move unless touched.</li>
      <li>It does the job, smells amazing, and doesn&#x27;t leave his hair flakey like the rest.</li>
      <li>Great hair control and loved the product until I broke out in major scalp rash!</li>

      <li>I have purchased this twice now as my husband and son love this product.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for more from a hair product.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described !!!</li>
      <li>Super hold and nice sent</li>
      <li>When rubbed in my hands, it foams up a bit, so it is easy to disperse evenly in my hair.</li>
      <li>This stuff is perfect for a nice tight hold which will stay nice and natural till the end of the day</li>

      <li>I pretty picky about what I put in my hair.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is fantastic - it is able to hold all day (and can take a fix or two with a damp hand run through), then at the end of the day, a quick dry muss through, and the hair&#x27;s back to its natural state.  </li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much and styling is much easier.</li>

      <li>The product itself is very much as advertised with an exceptional ability to hold and shape damaged and difficult hair.  </li>
      <li>At the end of those 15-20 minutes, the hair will blow in the wind naturally, is comfortable to run my hands through, and has only the same sheen it naturally has after shampooing and conditioning.</li>
      <li>No leftover stickiness, not so hard that a comb would tear your hair out, and easy to work in your hands.  </li>

    <li> Found this goop by accident - borrowed from a friend at the gym.  Will never go back.  Soup to nuts, its that good.  Somehow I use that to justify paying the crazy high price for it.&lt;br /&gt;Philly T-bone</li>
    <li> The product itself is very much as advertised with an exceptional ability to hold and shape damaged and difficult hair.  As received, however, it was swathed in extremely tenacious sticky tape which when finally removed with razor blade, scissors and putty knife, left a residue on the tube which had to be removed with mineral spirits and rubbing alcohol. No fun. Still smells like mineral spirits!</li>
    <li> This stuff is perfect for a nice tight hold which will stay nice and natural till the end of the day</li>
    <li> Great hold, very nice smell. I have purchased this twice now as my husband and son love this product. You don&#x27;t need much and styling is much easier.</li>
    <li> Good stuff but pricey!  I used to like Aramis Hair Gel for men but they discontinued it a while ago.  After trying several others from Target, etc. I found this from Aveda and it is very similar to the Aramis product.</li>
    <li> Super hold and nice sent</li>
    <li> I am a girl but like this both because it holds tightly and doesn&#x27;t mess with the keratin/color treatments in my hair.</li>
    <li> There are other gels that do the job for less money, but none smell like Aveda Pure Formance with Vetiver.</li>
    <li> This is the good stuff As far as gels go.  Lighter and more water soluble than any other gel I have tried.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My hair stylists over the years have suggested a number of different hair styling products based upon a few demands:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It should not make my hair look flammable.&lt;br /&gt;2. It should not make it uncomfortable to touch my hair.&lt;br /&gt;3. It should make my hair bounce back into place after being blown by the wind.&lt;br /&gt;4. It should hold my hair up from morning through the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of the suggested products ever worked. Then, one day, someone was handing out samples of this Aveda Men Pure-Performance Hold Gel on the subway platform in Manhattan. I figured, what the hell. I&#x27;m thinking about shaving my head anyway, so what&#x27;s the worst that can happen. Well, I&#x27;m glad I gave it a shot, and I have since purchased a 5oz bottle. It fits all of the requirements outlined above. When rubbed in my hands, it foams up a bit, so it is easy to disperse evenly in my hair. Once in my hair, my hair remains style-able for a good 15-20 minutes, but won&#x27;t move unless touched. At the end of those 15-20 minutes, the hair will blow in the wind naturally, is comfortable to run my hands through, and has only the same sheen it naturally has after shampooing and conditioning. When it is moved by the wind, etc. it sets back where I had styled it - perfectly - every time. I couldn&#x27;t ask for more from a hair product. I really feel like this is the holy grail of hair gel.</li>

    <li> Works well, and wife likes the scent of it.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair straw like after use :(, won&#x27;t be using it but the smell of the product is good.</li>
    <li> Not too crusty, but holds really well.  It also has the Aveda smell that I have grown to enjoy so much.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Manages my hair well, while it keeping it flexible.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described !!!</li>
    <li> My hubby loves this gel... It does the job, smells amazing, and doesn&#x27;t leave his hair flakey like the rest. He tried to go to the crew product and switched right back. Can&#x27;t go wrong with Aveda</li>
    <li> Great hair control and loved the product until I broke out in major scalp rash!</li>
    <li> I pretty picky about what I put in my hair.  This is just right.  A little bit goes a long way.  Pleasant smell and great hold without a plastered look.</li>
