<li> They had a few bumps and one stone missing but for the price and to give to young girls worth it.</li>
<li> Some of the rings were missing stones, they are decent though especially for the price.</li>
<li> I do think that the ring missing a stone may have been due to the handlers because there was crushed golden glass in the inner bag.</li>
<li> arrived in a bubble pouch, but the mail handlers were hard on it and there was a hole in it large enough for the rings to fall out.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s reasonable to complain too badly about minor flaws when I know the quality is going to be at least fair</li>
<li> The outside of rings were rough.</li>
<li> A SINGLE STAR</li>
<li> The rings are pretty but 2 were broken when I opened the package.</li>
<li> If I could give minus 5 stars</li>
<li> NOT REAL.</li>
<li> So I would minus 5 for the jewelry shop and also for Amazon for not taking the time to verify what their vendors are selling.  </li>
<li> with all the twisting and sharp points on the inside of them I don&#x27;t expect that.  </li>
<li> From one extreme to the other.  </li>
<li> And the other one had rings that were size 8 and 9.  </li>
<li> Lots of sharp edges on these rings!</li>
<li> These rings are from China and are not real anything!!</li>
<li> One looked like it was factory damaged, and the other was missing a stone.</li>
<li> they all turned black in 2 days of wearing them</li>
<li> And very little variety but for the price it&#x27;s expected</li>
<li> They turned my finger green in less than an hour.</li>
<li> These were going to be gifts for little girls that I don&#x27;t know.</li>
<li> Not worth a star rating!</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste any money on these.</li>
<li> They said they were sterling silver but are not, they make ur finge green, did not like.</li>
<li> I bought them as wedding party gifts and when I received them they were falling apart and within 2 hours turned my finger green.</li>
<li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting these to be as heavy as they were</li>
<li> Some were missing stones.</li>
<li> (missing stone)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Beyond disappointed that these rings are NOT sterling silver at all!...cheaply made, rough edges and some are pealing off!....too much hassle for a refund....will donate to kid&#x27;s toy box! These rings are a total joke!</li>
    <li> Wonderful rings. Decent quality, all the designs slightly different, perfect party bag stuffers or &amp;#34;friendship&amp;#34; rings to give to your tween (ages 10-13) to hand out  to all her best friends (10 to a bag). I was very pleased with the quality considering the price. I highly recommend them. I do NOT however recommend them for older girls (14 and up) -- the rings will be much too small. They are definitely all size 5/6 rings.</li>
    <li> The rings r cute jus not what I expected</li>
    <li> Came all mangled &amp; are definitely NOT sterling. Would not buy again!</li>
    <li> Some of the rings were missing stones, they are decent though especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Nice to brighten up ur hands</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these awesome lil rings 😊</li>
    <li> They turned 3days after i got them</li>
    <li> Pretty but they are small most just fit the pinkie</li>
    <li> Hi Keyzone I hope that these rings are sterling silver  like was mentioned as advertized  cause  I gave them to my granddaughter and she really loves them hope she does not have to throw them away I read some of the comments which I should have read before i bought them but I got them really cute plssss tell me there real sterling silver I know that they are real inexpensive but thats not the point I bought them because I am thinking that they will not turn on my baby  (worried)</li>
    <li> Nicely made  ....they all have a classic look to them</li>
    <li> These rings are junk. I bought them as wedding party gifts and when I received them they were falling apart and within 2 hours turned my finger green. I have bought from key zone before and ended up with garbage that time too. They are a failure as a company.</li>
    <li> Not sure if they are sterling silver, but it was fun to share these beauties with my girlfriends!</li>
    <li> This ring dill was supposed to be sterling silver but in fact was not. They don&#x27;t look anything like any in the add picture. If I would have known this, I would&#x27;ve bought something BESIDES THIS RIP OFF CUZ THE RINGS ARE UGLY AND LOOK LIKE THEY WERE DIPPED IN SILVER PAINT BECAUSE THE RINGS HAVE RUNS IN THEM. BELIEVE ME, THIS PRODUCT AIN&#x27;T WORTH BUYING. I DIDNT EVEN WANT TO GIVE THEM A SINGLE STAR BUT I HAD TO TO WRITE MY REVIEW.  CRACKER JACKS HAVE BETTER PRIZES.  THIS WAS A DISAPPENTMENT</li>
    <li> I ordered these rings and this is what I got 2 computer pieces imagine that.</li>
    <li> many broken pieces, good for childs play</li>
    <li> not sterling silver liked promised gave 1 star arrived early</li>
    <li> These turn copper after 1 day of wear.  Good for a night out, then toss.</li>
    <li> were as advertised, just not as I hoped.</li>
    <li> Not good turned my finger green! Do not buy</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting these to be as heavy as they were but they are beautiful rings! Definitely a stronger quality. There&#x27;s 5 different colors and several different sizes and shapes. Each ring is unique. Plus there&#x27;s a variety of sizes! Shipping was fast too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my unbiased, honest opinion and reveiw</li>
    <li> Cute arrived on time but is not sterling silver as advertised?</li>
    <li> went over like a charm, my nieces loved them, and they are super cute!</li>
    <li> Good solid ring with petie stone, my young customers love them</li>
    <li> They had a few bumps and one stone missing but for the price and to give to young girls worth it.</li>
    <li> The rings are not cute.  One bag has only rings that fit my 2 year old neices fingers.  And the other one had rings that were size 8 and 9.  From one extreme to the other.  Definitely do not look like sterling silver.  No 925 stamp anywhere but then again with all the twisting and sharp points on the inside of them I don&#x27;t expect that.  If I could give minus 5 stars I would, not because of what I ended up with but because of the flagrant way they false advertised and I doubt Amazon cares because they get their percentage anyway.  So I would minus 5 for the jewelry shop and also for Amazon for not taking the time to verify what their vendors are selling.  Bad experience.</li>
    <li> arrived earlier than expected I am very pleased with my rings</li>
    <li> The rings were very pretty. They would have been nicer if they were actually sterling silver. I was excited when my package arrived a day or two ago. I opened the envelope, and to my dismay they rings did not &amp;#34;clang&amp;#34; of metal. I continued to inspect the rings noticed they were jagged, and some looked to be peeling. Thought maybe it was me.....until later. Took the ring, decided to see if it would bend, IT BROKE!  Bent and broke a second ring also. These were going to be gifts for little girls that I don&#x27;t know. Something to make them feel pretty and loved. I can&#x27;t share that gift with someone knowing it&#x27;s going to break, change color, not hold up. Refund requested</li>
    <li> They started turning color.</li>
    <li> I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> Looks ok,but it was not sterling silver looks terrible after one day.I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> These are a good example of you get what you pay for! Great for a kid to wear and lose but as for an adult not even worth it.</li>
    <li> Sorry I won&#x27;t even give it one star.but its required to rate so I will rate one star..they all turned black in 2 days of wearing them</li>
    <li> 4 of the same rings and they don&#x27;t fit my fingers, just a few do!</li>
    <li> These are not sterling silver rings. False advertisement.</li>
    <li> I recieved my rings early. I was excited until I opened and inspected the rings. NONE are real sterling. They are poorly made. Some of mine aren&#x27;t even round and have metal in place of a stone! very disappointed. Even though they were cheap, still not worth the money!!</li>
    <li> I like it was all different sizes 4-8 so I can give them to different people they smaller ones I gave to some children who do have much and they thought so much I love the price and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I thought they were cute rings ,I haven&#x27;t wore them yet but for the price I got five and granddaughters Will get the rest, cause there&#x27;s different sizes .</li>
    <li> this is awesome ..  very pretty.. and will give as gifts to all the granddaughters and nieces</li>
    <li> These are not &amp;#34;sterling silver&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> They said they were sterling silver but are not, they make ur finge green, did not like.</li>
    <li> wish were same size but I like them.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.  Tiny and cheaply made.</li>
    <li> I received these yesterday. Two of the ten rings were considerably flawed. One looked like it was factory damaged, and the other was missing a stone. I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s reasonable to complain too badly about minor flaws when I know the quality is going to be at least fair considering what I paid for them.&lt;br /&gt;They arrived in a bubble pouch, but the mail handlers were hard on it and there was a hole in it large enough for the rings to fall out. I was lucky that didn&#x27;t happen. I do think that the ring missing a stone may have been due to the handlers because there was crushed golden glass in the inner bag. I still think I got a good enough deal. Below describes the condition of the rings, from left to right. Left (missing stone) Middle (Good Condition) Right (Factory Damage) I also took a photo of one of the good rings to show that they aren&#x27;t bad at all. Keep in mind that they are silver plated, not .925 silver.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you KeyZone.</li>
    <li> These rings does no deserve not even one stars. They were false advertized. How can amazon allow this scam. I though this is supposed to be a safe place to shop from scams. It clearly said Sterling Silver and high quality. But as someone else commented before. &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; However, its wrong to fool people like that. I hope no one else fall for this. They are heavy, black, cheap looking, deform and nowhere near Sterling Silver 925.</li>
    <li> These rings were advertised as sterling silver and they are not. They turned my finger green in less than an hour. They are cheap bubblegum rings in my opinion. Will not buy again</li>
    <li> did not realize they were junk</li>
    <li> ZERO STARS!!  I received these rings early, that&#x27;s the only good news. Some were missing stones. These rings ARE NOT STERLING SILVER!! Don&#x27;t waste any money on these. They are poor quality even for costume.</li>
    <li> Quite cheap. And very little variety but for the price it&#x27;s expected</li>
    <li> cheaply made and not real silver.</li>
    <li> The outside of rings were rough.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter. I expected them to be very cheap quality but they are actually quite nice.</li>
    <li> NOT REAL. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> It stated it was sterling silver there are fake</li>
    <li> These rings are from China and are not real anything!! The cut my finger! Because of how they are made!! Lots of sharp edges on these rings! Not worth a star rating! Ugly also. I would not recommend!</li>
    <li> I love these rings there so dainty and so pretty I like that there a mixture I wearing them right now I just love the jewelry that I have got on here I got so much now I order me another jewelry box to hold what I got now I never get tired of shopping here.this is the best site that I ever came across to shop.</li>
    <li> The rings are pretty but 2 were broken when I opened the package. Mine were between the size 6 &amp; 7. I wear a 7 and very tight when I tried them on. Was going to give some as gifts but decided against it. I guess you get what you pay for. Atleast there is 1 out of 10 I can wear.</li>
    <li> Great assortment! Customer service was helpful as well.</li>
