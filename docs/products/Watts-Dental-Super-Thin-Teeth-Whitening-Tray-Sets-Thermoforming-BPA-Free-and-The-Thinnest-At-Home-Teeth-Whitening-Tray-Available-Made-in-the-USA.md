      <li>They cost about $150, and they were fantastic!  </li>

      <li>The more I dipped and reinserted (</li>
      <li>so I still have 4 more remaining.  </li>
      <li>They are most helpful.</li>
      <li>I ended up zapping the water one more time for 20 seconds and re dipped the tray.</li>
      <li>I had to do this many times.  </li>
      <li>These are definitely the best of the many DIY whitening products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They more than cover the teeth, unlike so many others.  </li>
      <li>These where okay.</li>
      <li>The ones molded by the Dentist are much better.</li>
      <li>for some reason the bottoms are just ok. ...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These are awesome!!  Super thin and very comfortable. It took a couple of tries to get the molding process right so I&#x27;m glad I ordered the 6 pack of trays.  Bring your water to a boil but then let it cool for a few minutes before you insert the tray. You will start seeing the tray soften right away because the tab you are holding it with will start to bend. As soon as you see it soften, quickly insert the tray into your mouth and suck while you press firmly with your fingers.  The bottom tray was more difficult for me to mold. This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered whitening trays and I wanted something that was thin and comfortable. This is exactly what I got with this product.</li>
    <li> The tray forms were thin and after watching a utube explanation of how to make fit them, I had no difficulty and succeeded on the first try.  My mouth is very small so there is a &#x27;crimp&#x27; at the front, but they still are effective in holding the material against the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend them to anyone who is reasonably patient and careful!</li>
    <li> You get 3, so if you screw it up, you have two more tries.  The only way to screw it up is to ignore all the advice in Amazon!  I can tell you this, when you go to heat them; just do what others say.  Your brain is going to tell you to &#x27;leave &#x27;em in there another second or two just to be sure&#x27;;  don&#x27;t let your brain engage and you&#x27;ll be in good shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they are undercooked, wait a bit; let them cool all the way down. (put in cold water) and do it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHen you put them in your mouth, and  you suck out the air, its done.  Even if its not perfect, these work great anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use for whitening;  I had some grinding issues at night and was recommended to get a mouth piece, so I tried these.  By the 3rd night, they were toast, so not good for that (for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HERES the big problem with the ones at the dentist;  besides costing so much more;  next time you get a cap or some work done; they will want to make you another set!  So its not just one time they get you, its many times!  I know this from personal experience; since I went that route 5 years ago.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> To small for my mouth. They may be fine if you don&#x27;t care about back teeth fitting. But if you have a decent sized mouth I missed two back teeth on each side. And made it had for it to get a tight fit .amazon was great about refund. since no where did it mention they were this small.5** for amazon service</li>
    <li> They were very easy to use, simply dunk them for a few seconds (pull them out before they start to melt...) bit into it and they work!</li>
    <li> These work great for use when sleeping.  They are thin, unlike the usual tooth guards that are for athletes.  So it&#x27;s easier to sleep with them on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best,&lt;br /&gt;Rob</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the results I received from using this kit. Word of warning, though, about these boil and bit trays: the instructions say to submerge them in boiling water for 3-4 seconds. In my experience, that was way too much. The moment they hit three seconds, they were already melting into a ball of plastic. For my personal uses, 2.5 seconds was the sweet spot that ended up creating very well molded trays. Maybe I&#x27;m just not very good at this, but it&#x27;s a good thing that the package came with six trays (three pairs). I ruined four of them, but the remaining two were an ideal mold for my teeth. They&#x27;re not dental impressions directly quality by any means, but they will more than suffice for casual whitening. Ultimately, I&#x27;m quite pleased with these. As the description states, they&#x27;re definitely quite thin!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what other people are using.  I thought we bought the same product.  These suck.  You get what you pay for.  Seriously.  I&#x27;m going to try the mail in molds.  These are nothing like the Dental office.  And very uncomfortable.  And the molding?  Ummm no.</li>
    <li> I purchased these based on reviews from other people that said they were worth the price as compared to other bleaching trays available and they were right.  I lost the trays my dentist made for my teeth while traveling. They cost $300 or more to make.  I purchased these figuring I would try them and believe it or not, they ended up to be just as good as the custom made trays...  You need to carefully follow the directions but they end up being thin and tight fitting and very comfortable to wear.  I won&#x27;t bother with the expensive trays anymore!</li>
    <li> It takes some patience to get the trays formed properly, but they are good once you get it done.  They are not quite the quality you&#x27;d get from your dentist, but they are more than adequate--especially since they cost less than 10% of what our dentist charges.  DO read other reviewers comments for tips on how to get the trays formed right.  They are most helpful.</li>
    <li> These trays are by no means a &amp;#34;custom fit&amp;#34;. They are impossible to keep in your mouth after going through the process of fitting them. No way could you leave them in for any extended period of time. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Not that happy with the trays I bought. The ones molded by the Dentist are much better. Those really mold to your teeth. These do not.</li>
    <li> not that easy to model</li>
    <li> Item works perfectly fine for me. Microwaved water for 2 minutes, dipped in water for about 4-5 seconds. Molded to teeth as per instructions. It is pretty easy to use.</li>
    <li> Waste of money doesn&#x27;t stay in your mouth and doesn&#x27;t hole the whitening gel</li>
    <li> I have custom made trays from my dentist....THESE ARE BETTER!!!!!!!!   I could not believe it, but these really are...more comfortable too.....so cheap and will not use the ones my dentist made again!!!  Would totally recommend!</li>
    <li> I lost my custom ones in a move recently and I can&#x27;t seem to find them.  My dentist offered to remake them at a discount ($180 instead of $300) but I thought I&#x27;d just try these and see after digging on Amazon.  I&#x27;m amazed, they&#x27;re *almost* as perfect as the custom ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did as others suggested and read the instructions twice.  Once you heat these babies up theres no going back.  The package instructions suggested a boiling pan of water, or heat some water in the microwave - which is what I did.  After I pulled the water from the micro 3-4 seconds was just perfect.  Any longer and the sides were too soft, they couldn&#x27;t support themselves and they&#x27;d fold over as I was putting them in my mouth.  i found I could re-dip the tray back into the hot water and then back into my mouth for a second, third, fourth, fifth adjustment.  The more I dipped and reinserted (provided I was careful) the better and more custom fit they became.  As the water cooled from the microwave I could throw it back in and reheat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Altogether it took about a half hour to do.  The upper tray was much easier than the lower.  I had to throw two trays away because I over-softened them and they folded.  For the lower arch I also found it a little easier to dip the tray, insert it, and then squeeze it with my fingers and press it into shape.  I also found that I could dip the back half of the try, form it, and then dip the front half of the tray and form that.  It made a bit better shape if I tried to remold it that way a couple times.  Altogether I experimented with two, I have two (one upper and one lower) that fit perfect, and I have two backup ones in case I lose them again.  I trimmed them with a paring knife which was a bit precarious, and I took off that annoying tab that stuck out.  I&#x27;ll probably try and file it smoother with a nail file when I get some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experience was great.  Product works as stated.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.  And for this price,I can buy a dozen of these little trays for the price of a set of custom ones.</li>
    <li> I am totally pleased with the much thinner trays.  Very easy to fit. . .and to wear.  The delivery was prompt.  A+  Thanks!</li>
    <li> not that easy to shape to teeth and really too big and awkward (for my/my husband&#x27;s mouth) to just use as unshaped trays.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> seamed to be ok, they do work, not near as good as you would get from a Dentist, but a lot cheaper</li>
    <li> I love these things. I&#x27;ll admit, it takes a few tries to get the hang of it, but it&#x27;s completely worth the learning curve. Dentists can charge hundreds of dollars for this, so it&#x27;s worth a shot to see if it can be done by oneself.</li>
    <li> I have crooked teeth in the front and no matter how many ways I tried or how careful I was, these just wouldn&#x27;t form well to my teeth.</li>
    <li> As other have stated, the trays are very stiff and slightly larger than I expected.  I should have read the more negative reviews and passed on the whitening trays but the price was very reasonable; which is not really the case if you can&#x27;t use them. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase them again.</li>
    <li> I seldom do reviews on any products but these Watts Super thin trays are really worth mentioning. Just be sure to cut the boiling time in half and you will be good to go. If you don&#x27;t get the proper fit the first time the kit has plenty of more trays to work with. These are so light and comfortable you can actually sleep with them on.&lt;br /&gt;I guarantee you will love these!</li>
    <li> These are so much thinner and more comfortable than the standard moldable trays from the drugstore. I read the reviews on how to mold them. Because they are so thin they do soften quickly in hot water. I found that using water about to boil (can see bubbles on the bottom of the pot) works best. It&#x27;s more gradual and you can drip it a few times without ruining trays. I would just take your time. So worth it!</li>
    <li> works well.  Not as good as the trays from the dentist but its a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> GREAT SERVICE AND PRODUCT</li>
    <li> These are OK in a pinch, but are nowhere near as good as the ones the dentist made for me years ago. You have to be very careful not to hold them in the boiling water too long, and then it can be hard to mold them to your bottom teeth with any efficiency. Did OK with the top mold but never did get a decent bottom one. For the price, through, you can&#x27;t beat them, and they will definitely help with tooth bleaching - they just don&#x27;t fit as nicely as the professional (and, OK, MUCH more expensive) ones.</li>
    <li> So far, these have held up and serve the purpose.  I have a big family, and couldn&#x27;t afford to pay top dollar for teeth to be whitened.  I have professional trays, and these aren&#x27;t that, but they are very decent for the price.  Not too thick.  We take good care of our&#x27;s.  I would say order extra because they are easy to mess up during the molding process.  An extra second too long in the water, or not being quick to apply will result in a wadded, un-useable, mess.  Once we practiced and got the hang of it, they weren&#x27;t too hard to make.  My kids aren husband are glad to have these to help with whitening.  I would say this is worth the money and a good product.</li>
    <li> These trays are way more comfortable to use than the ones that came in the whitening kit I bought.  I also had an easier time molding them, but that might be because I had already had practice on the other ones.  I was glad I had six, so I knew if I ruined one, or a couple, it would be ok.</li>
    <li> I just used these tonight for the first time, What i can say is, they are too thick, they hardly take the shape of your teeth..but they are better than nothing i suppose. Tomorrow i will try ceran wrap.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product. It doesn&#x27;t adhere to the teeth.</li>
    <li> The thin form factor is a plus if you&#x27;re keeping it in your mouth for extended gel treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But its a little long even after the heat moulding process, so I had to snip the ends off both ends and trim, after which it worked very well and felt comfortable.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I lost my lower dentist office made tray.  I love how thin they are!  I had tried another brand, but it was so bulky and uncomfortable.  When I saw this six pack, I figured I could make some trays for my teens as well.  We used five trays to end up with four good ones.  The upper trays are easier to mold than the one for the lower teeth. Try using a mirror and if it looks like one part is folding over, take it out of your mouth right away, try bending it back and put it back in the hot water to make another attempt with the same tray. I tried my lower one that way and probably put it in the water five times before I was happy with it.  I did trim the trays with sharp scissors.  Because all the teeth indentations were not so apparent, I ended up putting the tray in my mouth to see where the gum line really was and then took it out to cut.  I had to do this many times.  These trays do involve some effort, but for $15, how can you go wrong.  I paid over $300 for the ones the dentist made.  Crazy.  Wish I would have known about these back then.</li>
    <li> This is the easiest whitening trays to work with....be careful not to hold them in boiling water to long. I found it easier to actually move the pan off the lit stove and hold moldings in for about 4 seconds in the hot (not boiling) water. Perfect on the first try :)</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a good product from all the great reviews, but it was a waste of money. It doesn&#x27;t fit good at all. I wouldn&#x27;t refer this to anyone!</li>
    <li> hard to mold. but was good.</li>
    <li> Thank you, these were delivered as promised , well packed , great price. I  thought they might be a little thinner though. Still very  happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> Other than it works I don&#x27;t know what else to say, I haven&#x27;t used it steadily but it is full strength for sure, my teeth were immediately whiter after using I&#x27;m just not consistent.</li>
    <li> Followed directions closely. Could not get a good fit. Pieces kept folding in and ruining mold. Just using retainer + whitening gel to see if it is adequate. If not, will fork $ for custom fit molds by professional.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews about how these things fold up into a ball of plastic in boiling water, I decided to microwave a cup of water until it was hot, but not boiling.  If you dip it quickly, form it to your teeth after a few more dips in hot water, these work the way they&#x27;re supposed to work.  I made top and bottom molds on my first try.  So don&#x27;t boil the water, and know that you can always re-dip into hot water if it didn&#x27;t mold enough the first time.  I haven&#x27;t used others so I can&#x27;t comment on whether they&#x27;re thick or thin, but I was able to put both in my mouth at the same time with little discomfort.</li>
    <li> Thinnest, make at home variety I could find.  Works well.</li>
    <li> Horrible.  I wasted my money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of home teeth whitening as it is so expensive at the dentist. These strips are so thin and comfortable! I had those thick horrible ones and I could never get a good fit. Either they didn&#x27;t melt enough to form to my teeth, or they balled up right away and I had to trash them. Plus, the bulkier ones gave me a headache (something about how I had to clench my teeth to shut my mouth and not drool all over myself).</li>
    <li> The thermo trays, although possibly overpriced, were exactly what I needed.  The recommended instructions weren&#x27;t perfect.  I&#x27;d only dip the tray into boiling water for three seconds.</li>
    <li> These are great. I only needed to use 2 out of the 6 so far. Just boil water in a big pot, dunk a tray in for 3 seconds, take out and place into your mouth to form the mold. Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Well priced and easy to customize to your mouth. Buy the 35% whitener for the best results. Great product reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> these are slightly slimmer fit than the normal heat and fit trays. They are easy to fit and cut to avoid bleach sitting on your gums.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product! Heat the mouth piece for 4 seconds in a cup with boiling hot water then I put it in my mouth. I got a perfect impression every time. Easy to do my top teeth . . . worked perfectly  . ..  .but  for some reason the bottoms are just ok. ... .. I did everything right. The bottoms just don&#x27;t come out as perfect as the top for some reason? I tried 3 times. They are still good enough to use. For the price I cannot complain.&lt;br /&gt;This is a very easy cheap way to get a mouth piece for whitening trays. The top one looks as good as I had done at my dentist office 10 years ago. Now, that I have these I will throw the old ones out! The top came out as good as I had custom made for $450.00 at my dentist office. Save your money and buy these . . .. .just as good as custom!</li>
    <li> didnt get close enough fit on teeth, but will have to try again</li>
    <li> I had the regular size (thicker) whitening trays and I was looking to try to find something closer to the ones I had made at the dentist years ago.  These are only a slight improvement over the cheaper ones.  I did not have any trouble with them folding up and becoming a ball of goo, as others have mentioned they had happen.  I will definitely be using these, as opposed to paying $150.00 to have my dentist remake them.  They work fine for the hour I use my whitening gel.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to sleep in them, but that probably wouldn&#x27;t be much different than the higher priced ones.</li>
    <li> With patience, you can create an excellent mold of your teeth. The lack of thickness enables this product to make a better mold of your teeth compared to the thicker molds available. But due to the lack of thickness, if you heat the mold even slightly too long, you will end up with a plastic blob. Use patience, read the instructions, and watch youtube videos. The end result is worth it.</li>
    <li> I watched several YouTube videos on how to make these before attempting my own, and it really isn&#x27;t all that difficult.  It took me about 30 minutes to get a good mold on top and bottom, then some time after that to trim them down.  They&#x27;re not nearly as thin as the ones the dentist will make for you, but all they have to do it hold the gel on your teeth and they do that well (provided you get a good mold).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a chronic Amazon review reader and researched the heck out of these types of trays before making a purchase (I know...pathetic). I&#x27;ll save you the trouble: just buy these, mold them, and get on with your teeth whitening.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have several other trays, and these are the best. I use them for whitening, and they form-fit to my teeth better than the others. Also, it comes with 3 trays, so if you make a mistake you can try again!</li>
    <li> This product and the trey was too small and too thin.  It will not cover all your teeth unless you have a small mouth.  I ended up getting adult Wilson athletic teeth guards from Walmart at 96 cents each.  That worked nicely.</li>
    <li> i would say, its OK, not woow, but it will do the job, not as good as the 1 get from dentist, but good for the price</li>
    <li> excellent as described</li>
    <li> Works great! I did have to trim a little after my mold was set on the top part. It was hitting my gums. But great buy! I use it with ultra white gel, and they work beautifully together!</li>
    <li> OK, so we tried the stronger 30+ percent gel, and it stings the gums. This did not, and it does a good job bleaching out the faint yellow that tends to build up every couple years. Teeth look great again. Probably should use this monthly from now on to keep that white teeth sexy smile. Recommended.</li>
    <li> If you prepare it carefully as instructed, upper tray would fit in to your teeth. How ever don&#x27;t expect the same from the lower tray. It don&#x27;t cover the lower teeth inside of you mouth and as a result whitening product is always diluted from my spit before it does it job.</li>
    <li> They are OK, BUT HARD TO COMPARE WITH WHAT PROFESSIONAL TRAYS COULD DO.</li>
    <li> I had to put it in the water s couple of times because it would curl up, which made it difficult to mould. Otherwise, works great for whitening once you get it to work with the water.</li>
    <li> I use these for a night-guard. They work wonderfully! Still on the first one for months! Very thin and durable!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these</li>
    <li> Tricky to get the timing right, as far as boiling.  Took me several tries to get proper molds, but once done, they worked very well.</li>
    <li> Do not leave these in boiling hot water for more than 2.5 seconds (2 to be safe) or they will melt into a ball of junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are good for the price, and good enough to do the job. You&#x27;ll get a decent mold of your mouth, and they are way easier on the mouth then the normal clunky ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some trouble with getting a mold of my bottom teeth, could be because I have small bottom teeth. But still, it&#x27;ll do for holding the teeth whitening gel.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product.</li>
    <li> I received these molds in just 3 days. I boiled the water and placed them in the water for 2 seconds and all is well.  They actually fit pretty well right out of the box.  They are some what comfortable.  I have sensitive gums and had some bleeding but these are not made for comfort. Overall I would say these are definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> A few years ago, I had whitening trays made through my dentist.  They cost about $150, and they were fantastic!  After a year or two of use, they were somehow lost, and since then I&#x27;ve tried various strips and trays for whitening and haven&#x27;t found anything that works even half as well.  Even standard boil-and-bite trays are useless, because they&#x27;re so thick that they don&#x27;t retain the peroxide gel properly and it&#x27;s difficult to breathe when using them.  These thinner trays are great so far, though -- definitely a very close second to my professionally made trays, and for the price, there&#x27;s no question that these are the better option.  They don&#x27;t fit quite as closely as my professionally made trays, but they&#x27;re snug enough to stay in place without the frequent readjustments required by other products, and they keep the gel in.  It&#x27;s even possible to talk with the trays in (though not very well).  These are definitely the best of the many DIY whitening products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice: The directions say to hold the trays in boiling water for three to four seconds, but I found that two second was about the longest that I could put them in the water without completely deforming them.  I had to go through all six trays before I got an upper and lower with which I was satisfied.  Make sure to slide the trays in so that your molars don&#x27;t fold the backs of the trays inward -- lumpiness in the back causes the front of the trays to fit improperly (although depending on what it looks like, you can probably trim the backs of the trays to fit better).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the best home whitening product I&#x27;ve tried so far!</li>
    <li> This product is great. Workes well. It is very strong. Becareful of it making you teth sensitve. I use mine in trays.</li>
    <li> its really comfy to sleep in them and I can talk with the tray in my mouth that is how thin they are. I expected a little more from this product. but I am not complaning becuase it works great I sleep and white my teeth with them. for this price it is really good TRY IT YOU WONT REGRET IT!!!!</li>
    <li> These thinner trays are awesome. you can put both upper and lower in at the same time. so thin, you practically forget they&#x27;re in.</li>
    <li> These trays actually work well. Just be sure not to immerse them in boiling water more than 4 seconds, otherwise trays will collapse into a plastic glob. You&#x27;re warned of this on the manufacturer&#x27;s insert, but sometimes trays don&#x27;t soften as quickly as these do. Obviously it&#x27;s the nature of the thin walls of the product that makes them turn gelatinous so rapidly. Otherwise these do the job as advertised.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for teeth whitening.  I tried 2 other more expensive brands and a) had trouble fitting them, and then b) felt like a football player with teeth guards in they were so big.  These mold just fine and fit comfortably.</li>
    <li> These did the job, for half of the time I needed them too.  Maybe my mouth is just small, but these are not thin, and they go so far behind my molars that it&#x27;s basically in my throat, making me gag constantly.</li>
    <li> Works ok just couldn&#x27;t mold very easy</li>
    <li> These are FANTASTIC!!!  Not quite as thin as the dentist, but so easy to form, I can even sleep in them!</li>
    <li> I tried it several times and never could get it to form to my small mouth.  THUMBS DOWN!!  It&#x27;s a waste of money!</li>
    <li> would not recommend to anyone.  they are too thick and do not mold to your mouth size like described in the advertisement.</li>
    <li> Bought these to use with remineralization gel after teeth whitening and it works great. As other reviewers suggested, only keep the tray in the hot water for about one second (really - that&#x27;s all). If it&#x27;s not soft enough, re-dip it for one more second. Better to do multiple dips than to dip it for too long and end up with a ball of mush. I&#x27;m still on my first one so I can&#x27;t comment on how well they last but I only use it for about 5 minutes a day so this package should last me quite a long time.</li>
    <li> After trying another brand, I much prefer the Watts Dental Supper Thin Trays.  Others that I&#x27;ve purchased were much more difficult, if not impossible, to make a good form of my teeth because they were too thick.  I purchased two six packs for our family and they worked very well.  I had read several of the reviews posted on Amazon and followed their instructions directing that I keep the forms in the hot water for only about two seconds, not the four listed in the directions included.  Be very careful when forming the lower tray, as it is easy to accidently let it fold on top of itself as you slide it back onto your rear teeth.</li>
    <li> awesome, totally worth the money! these worked so good. they are better than the first ones I bought from the dentist -even more sturdy.</li>
    <li> I was successful on the first try and got almost perfect result. All I had to do to get it right was cut off some of the extra plastic for it to fit my small teeth. Highly recommend for whitening and remineralizing.</li>
    <li> These are very easy to use and very thin. Don&#x27;t boil over 3 seconds or they&#x27;re mush but work well with the watts 35% were using with them.</li>
    <li> Super thin, very comfortable trays.  Work great with my whitening gel.  Have to be careful not to overcook as they will shrivel up into a useless ball if you do.  Just follow the instructions and they work perfectly!</li>
    <li> careful not to leave it in boiling water too long!</li>
    <li> These did not work, they were too tall in the front. When I molded them to my teeth and put the whitening gel in the tray, the gel made blisters on my gums and my gums turned white and started burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a waste of.money for these molds. I do not recommend these.</li>
    <li> When I tried to mold to my teeth it was so flimsy couldn&#x27;t get it to work. Would not recommend  .</li>
    <li> I followed instructions exactly and tried forming two of the six trays provided. Both turned out to be very poorly fitting. I didn&#x27;t even try to use them afterwards, as it was obvious that they would not stay in place on my teeth. This was  a wasted purchase. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s there to say?  They&#x27;re exactly as advertised and worked as advertised.</li>
    <li> Not what works easily....too thick...uncomfortable</li>
    <li> These are okay, but nothing exceptional.  They work fine.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different brands of the do it yourself trays. I also have trays that were custom made at the Dentists office. These trays are not as thin as the ones from the Dentist, but they are thinner than any other ones I have tried, and by far, the most comfortable to wear. And 1/10th the price of custom made trays!&lt;br /&gt;What worked for me to form them correctly was this: I used a coffee cup of hot water, just zapped it in the microwave for about 45seconds, the water was steaming, but not boiling. I dipped the tray in the cup for about 10 seconds and then put it in my mouth. I ended up zapping the water one more time for 20 seconds and re dipped the tray. The nice thing is that using this method, the tray never became a ball of plastic, the trays re melts and can be reformed several times until you get the water temp just right to form it to your teeth perfectly. I did not ruin any trays with this method. I went ahead and did 2 trays, leaving the other 4 in the tray they came in for later.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy these again, as they are the best and thinnest I have found yet.</li>
    <li> These where okay. I practiced before inserting into the boiling water. The first one melted in 4 secs and folded over- had to throw away. Finally on the last one I ended up with just one upper that I can use. I do not want to spend another $16 to have a lower one :(</li>
    <li> Because these are so thin, they are soooo comfortable in your mouth.  I do want to thank everyone who left reviews tho&#x27; because your suggestions made it possible for me to mold them to my mouth without ruining a single, solitary one :)</li>
    <li> I previously ordered the regular mouth trays and they were way too bulky. I bought these with my fingers crossed they would work and I wouldn&#x27;t have to end up spending a lot of money on some measly mouth trays and they are great! Much thinner than the regulars trays which means way more comfortable.</li>
    <li> Place it in water boiling for only two seconds and not three or four as described on the package and it will work perfectly.</li>
    <li> Had to buy these after my kid shredded my set from the dentist.  These are not as thin and not formed quite as tightly, but seem to do the job anyway. The dentist ones fit snugly enough to open my mouth with them in; these do not. I followed other reviewers&#x27; suggestions and only held these in the boiling water for about 2 seconds. As soon as I saw them start to droop I pulled them out. I was worried they may burn my mouth but they didn&#x27;t at all. I formed them as the instructions on the package described, and it worked great. One of them wasn&#x27;t as good as it might have been on the first try, so I re-melted and tried again. Worked great. So a tip for new users would be- better to take out of the boil too soon and try again, than to hold it in too long and lose it altogether. Go for it- these are worth a try.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Much more comfortable than others that I have tried. Great for whitening trays.. Easy to form.. I would buy this product, and from this seller again... They shipped quickly. Hope this helps ease your mind if considering ordering these..\\&quot;</li>
    <li> These work perfectly...practice first.</li>
    <li> Very good Tooth whitening product, STRONG.. Harsh on gums so be very careful with application. Whitens very nicley caused some sensitivity</li>
    <li> These work. Barely. But, if you&#x27;re using them for bleaching your teeth at home, just take the hit and pay your dentist to make custom trays. You&#x27;ll get much better results in less time with custom trays, and they will be immensely more comfortable.</li>
    <li> This is the worse product I ever purchased from Amazon. They are much thicker than They advertised. The first one melted . The next three turned up when i bit down on it and it was folded over . I tried to re- melt it without success . The last one was to loose . These are nothing like my old Zoom mouth guards . Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> it is not super thin, and it looks super cheap. I returned it right away after I received it, period.</li>
    <li> Great product, and phenomenal price!! I have used dentist bleaching trays for 10+years.  These are extremely comparable and so affordable.  I know just buy my gel from the dentist!!</li>
    <li> They were easy to use.</li>
    <li> These work perfectly with my tooth whitening gel.  I used the coffee mug filled with water and placed in the microwave for a minute and a half.  Place the tray in the hot water and tap the tray against the side of the mug and you can actually feed it loosen up and get super soft so you can gauge when its a good time to remove.  As soon as you feel it get super soft throw it in your mouth and use your fingers to press it tightly against your teeth for about 15 seconds.  I was able to get a very good mold using this method.  It actually almost clicks into place it fits so good.  I was able to get them right the first try so I still have 4 more remaining.  Would definitely recommend this and would buy again!</li>
    <li> I almost didn&#x27;t purchase these trays due to reviews of them falling apart, but I am glad I did because these thing are awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heeding everyone&#x27;s warnings, I didn&#x27;t boil water, but instead I put a cup of water in the microwave until it barely began to boil and then removed it from the microwave. When I stuck the trays in the water, it was NOT boiling but steam was rising from the water. I stuck the trays in the water for about 5ish seconds, basically until the front of the trays began to curl in.  As soon as they began to curl, I took them out and formed them to my teeth. I didn&#x27;t waste any of them, the first pair I fit worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work great! Glad I purchased and figured out how to do it myself, not based on them falling apart for others.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Doesn&#x27;t mold perfectly, but still works.</li>
    <li> A little hard to form, so it&#x27;s nice that it come with a few extras. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re super thin, but they&#x27;re definitely thinner that what I&#x27;ve found in most grocery store whitening kits.</li>
    <li> They are not as good as I thought they would be. They&#x27;re thicker the &amp;#34;super thin&amp;#34; and hard to keep in you mouth.</li>
    <li> I never really liked the disposable whitening strips, so I purchased these and some whitening gel to do my own at-home teeth whitening. They were quite easy to mold--I just dipped them into hot water for a few seconds at a time until they fit right. It was a little tricky at first--I accidentally folded over one of the edges at first, but I was able to re-heat the tray and re-form it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to cut down the edges with some scissors, and then I used a lighter to soften the sharp edges left behind by the scissors. I use these for whitening every week now, and I may start using them at night to avoid clenching my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical of the price at first, but I think these are well worth it. I also bought a small retainer case to store them in.</li>
    <li> These tray are more than I expected.  They more than cover the teeth, unlike so many others.  They really protect the rest of my mouth from the whitening agent I use with them. It did take me two times to get the top tray right.  But since there are 6 in the package I didn&#x27;t worry about wasting one.</li>
    <li> I read the multiple reviews on this product about how difficult it was to use; problems with melting, going through multiple trays to get the form right, etc. Granted- my first set was a no go as my molars folded the back edges in and the perfectionist in me just wouldn&#x27;t stand for it. So, try #2 I was very careful to slide the tray along my teeth from front to back as opposed to biting down. As for these things melting into a pile of mush in less than three seconds? Not an issue I had. I just kept that in mind and used the &amp;#34;less is more&amp;#34; philosophy. After all, if its not warm enough, you can dip it back in the water. Which leads me to my little tip- I did notice that some areas didn&#x27;t quite get the fit that I wanted on the first try. To combat this, I simply re-dipped that part of the tray and inserted it again until I got it to fit the way I wanted. So, with multiple quick dips I found this product to be much less finicky than other reviews led me to believe. Its a very comfortable fit in my tiny mouth!</li>
    <li> Use them everytime I whiten, no complaints, are just as described!  I like that theyre thinner that usual ones that come with whitening kits</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if its normal but after melting the trays and placing them on my teeth to form them, they had a bad taste which made me leery of using. I went back to using the old ones that the dentist gave me.</li>
    <li> You got to be fast when you dip the thing in that hot water. Works great!</li>
    <li> Way more comfortable than other trays I&#x27;ve used, and easily about one third as thin! Molding them can be a little trickier since they&#x27;re so thin, but comfort factor outweighs that for me. I did get a good mold from my first set. When trimming them, especially the tabs, I suggest using nail clippers to get rid of edges that can be difficult to snip with scissors. I&#x27;d buy these again; they&#x27;re worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Great, comfy, don&#x27;t leak the gel. No more than 2-3 sec in boiling water and please practice at least 10 times before attempting to form.</li>
    <li> Takes a while to actually get the bottom one to mold but still great!</li>
    <li> Not really bend-able like they say</li>
    <li> Had to use a few to get the right fit but once fitted the product was excellent.</li>
    <li> I do not like it very much. It does not mold to the teeth very good. One sec. to long in the water and you have a rubber-ball.</li>
    <li> These were terrible.  I had them in and out of the water as quickly as humanly possible and they still melted into a mess.</li>
    <li> These are so hard to mold onto your teeth. I tried to mold them but couldnt even soften them up in warm water without them curling up in a ball of useless plastic. Save your money!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why this item got some high reviews. It is definitively not worth the $18 I spent on it. It item is not made well at all.  I followed the directions carefully and I couldn&#x27;t get it to mold correctly to my teeth and to stick to them. It kept falling out my mouth.</li>
</ol>
