      <li>/&gt;Luckily for me it does what I need it to do and works perfect on my body hair</li>
      <li>body trimmer performs perfectly.</li>
      <li>THE BEST SHAVE EVER!</li>
      <li>Perfect.</li>
      <li>The body shaver works well, but isn&#x27;t perfect.</li>
      <li>It just didn&#x27;t do a very good job</li>
      <li>/&gt;+ foil head isn&#x27;t as great at handling contoured areas as well as the independent-head shavers</li>
      <li>great pop-up trimmer -- tested this on my chest, works great for precision trimming.</li>
      <li>Compact, Great value for the price.</li>
      <li>Great for ear lobe hair.</li>
      <li>want to emphasize that even though it&#x27;s a body shaver, it also does a great job on my face.  </li>
      <li>The handle&#x27;s rubber grip is nice and the size is perfect.</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t benefit greatly from this shaver.</li>
      <li>I think you&#x27;ll be happy with this one.</li>
      <li>I use this for both face and body, it works great.  </li>
      <li>bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grip is excellent and this has a nice feel and balance in the hand.  </li>
      <li>And everything about it has been great for me.  </li>
      <li>I know this Panasonic is designed for men, but with the price of disposable shavers these days, I welcome an electric shaver for my legs over buying $12 disposable shaver refills.</li>
      <li>This Panasonic Body Shaver looks very nice.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this shaver, but I was IMPRESSED and am now using this exclusively...</li>
      <li>Panasonic makes good products and this one is no exception.</li>
      <li>It does the job, but it does not do it as good as I&#x27;ve hoped for.</li>
      <li>But that&#x27;s probably a good thing.</li>
      <li>The trimmer is not quite as good as my Norelco, but it is still serviceable.  </li>
      <li>Good looking device but additional plastic heads doesn&#x27;t work, so as body shaverit not working.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a good bargain.</li>
      <li>the price, this is a good shaver, and you can&#x27;t beat the wet/dry uses.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t in good faith recommend this item</li>
      <li>Honestly I chose because I saw good references in Men&#x27;s health magazine .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well-made, compact, and effective at getting the job done.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product as my husband has used it and liked it.  </li>
      <li>It just doesn&#x27;t work well; the blade seems to be so small/hidden that it won&#x27;t effectively cut hair.</li>
      <li>Also, it comes in handy when you travel.</li>
      <li>When I saw this and saw how it was packaged showing just what I wanted it for on the box - shaving a man&#x27;s body - I was thrilled.  </li>
      <li>Kind of a joke.  </li>
      <li>The grip is excellent and the charging stand holds the shaver very well.  </li>
      <li>In terms of look, this body razor has a nice style.  </li>
      <li>The side trimmer is fairly sturdy, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better than one on a dedicated face shaver.</li>
      <li>the product is the one that was seen in the photos, excellent quality, portable, durable, original, impressive both in body and face shaved, right cost, meets all the specifications it says the seller on the page, come to the site in its original packaging , well presented, and preserved, without any kind of detail, I can recommend the seller and the product with eyes closed, as they demonstrate that they comply with everything, it really is excellent</li>
      <li>I put on one of the attachments, which did not go on very easily.  </li>
      <li>It cleans very easily - just rinse under water.  </li>
      <li>trimmer without the plastic combs works fairly well, and if you need to remove hair before shaving it smooth, it gets the job done.</li>
      <li>No reason why this wouldn&#x27;t be suitable for ladies as well.</li>
      <li>its very fine and waterproof stuff is the s</li>
      <li>Love the fact that I can shave with it in the shower, and get a good clean shave on my face, too.  </li>
      <li>I like the shape as it is very comfortable in your hand regardless of which angle you are holding it.</li>
      <li>Very smooth shave with that.</li>
      <li>The rubberized grip is nice, as is the wet/dry feature, which makes for easy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I am more adjusted to this shaver.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t ask for much more than that.</li>
      <li>Better grab a pair of clippers.</li>
      <li>, Europe more than CNY 300, so it is absolutely worthwhile to buy in the United States.</li>
      <li>Overall, I was very impressed with this product.  </li>
      <li>good as i thought, easy to use and clean</li>
      <li>wife tried the ER-GK40 on her legs and said that it did OK for an electric shaver</li>
      <li>My favorite part is that one can use it in the water.</li>
      <li>At the top where the blade is located, the width is 1.75\\&quot;, while the thinner/narrower part of the body is 1.25\\</li>
      <li>It may work better for others.</li>
      <li>This shaver is great if you&#x27;re just going straight skin and BONUS</li>
      <li>; that is an oversight too many products make these days.  </li>
      <li>You can pay many times more for a electric shaver but for the price</li>
      <li>For now though - just okay.</li>
      <li>love the fact that these Panasonic grooming products are all wet/dry.</li>
      <li>I think if they did, they would sell more and expand their market.  </li>
      <li>This body shaver is my latest addition</li>
      <li>Just pop the top and rinse it away.  </li>
      <li>I have purchased many beard/hair trimmers hoping they would work that just didn&#x27;t cut it.  </li>
      <li>like many others, think it is not suited for everybody trying to do everything.  </li>
      <li>, we find it OK for the face when in need.</li>
      <li>It worked better for him, even with no guard installed.</li>
      <li>The trimmer could be better.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about a \\&quot;body shaver\\&quot; as the picture on the box highlights the underarms, chest, groin, and legs.</li>
      <li>For all of the guys who love to manscape this is the one for you.</li>
      <li>I had a Phillips Norelco body shaver for 3 years, and felt there had to be something better out there.</li>
      <li>I have owned many panasonic shavers and this was not up to par in comparison.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s best to just leave it in the charger, but if you have limited counter space, that can be a bummer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and very easy to clean.</li>
      <li>I was excited at the prospect because I have a Panasonic face razor that I LOVE.</li>
      <li>This is exceptionally easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>: Sleek, easy to grip, easy to clean, price, battery holds charge for many shaves&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>The shaver itself is well-designed with a slot to rinse the blade from inside, and easy access to the inside rotating blade.</li>
      <li>Strongly recommended.</li>
      <li>Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Black/Silver]]) and have liked them very much.</li>
      <li>The trimmer clippers would be fine for squaring off your sideburns, but that is it.  </li>
      <li>Seems to work just fine</li>
      <li>And I must say, for me, it works just fine.  </li>
      <li>The shaver was easy for me to hold and was comfortable in my hand.  </li>
      <li>Blue body color is also very handsome!</li>
      <li>because it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
      <li>I tried the trimmer alone and it also tugged a bit and wasn&#x27;t comfortable.</li>
      <li>The Panasonic ER-GK40-S body shaver is a fantastic product for those who don&#x27;t want to use a razor blade and scissors.</li>
      <li>The most comfortable body grooming to me comes in standard trimmer form, but this is a good alternative option for those who want to get closer to the skin.</li>
      <li>I was happy to see someone actually thought \\&quot;Hey, what if we sold something that encouraged men to groom themselves\\&quot; considering it&#x27;s 2013, and about darn time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>stays charged for reasonable period and provides a nice shave.</li>
      <li>My armpits and abs were smooth after using it there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;+ ergonomic design, comfortable to hold and use</li>
      <li>a _comfortable_ shave</li>
      <li>So it was not as smooth as a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t envision myself using this, but it will give you a close, smooth trim</li>
      <li>I have medium sized hands and even though the shaver is narrow/thin, it fits comfortably in my hands.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazon original box sent to China, the box doesn&#x27;t contain shockproof foam, just mount a product box, but the box doesn&#x27;t appear damaged condition, and can withstand brutal domestic courier sorting. About 1.8 pounds, you should buy a transformer (original power shows\\&quot;input 120V ~ 60Hz 6mA\\&quot;) in Taobao. However, the shaver has a little power, you can used for some time. Machine pleasing texture, functionality though, and ES-SL41 is almost, but the machine&#x27;s touch, shape the absolute spike ES-SL41. U.S. price over CNY 180, CNY 500 in Japan, Europe more than CNY 300, so it is absolutely worthwhile to buy in the United States. Blue body color is also very handsome!</li>
    <li> While I only really use it for regular body hair trimming and once a year cutting my beard down for easier shaving, it performs beautifully for both myself and my wife. I like the shape as it is very comfortable in your hand regardless of which angle you are holding it. Being able to change the depth guard so fine is fantastic, it holds a good charge, isn&#x27;t as loud as my previous shaver, and honestly looks pretty cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a new, versatile and durable shaver.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really provide a clean shave.</li>
    <li> This product was very underwhelming. I expected it to have a much closer cut then it did, but unfortunately it takes repeated passes to get anything done. The edger or trimmer is downright painful to use. It just pulls the hair and can take large pieces of skin off at any random moment. I tried every possible direction to avoid this happening, but just gave up using it all together. Very disappointed that this was so poorly made.</li>
    <li> the only thing is the battery it charges for 15 hours and usefull only 28 minutes but its very fine and waterproof stuff is the s***!</li>
    <li> Promises too much and delivers too little.  It will work with some patience and actually works better when wet.  But still doesn&#x27;t do as advertised.</li>
    <li> I bought this body groomer for 2 reasons: 1. to stop using normal blade and 2. because it&#x27;s cheap. I find it quite suitable for the job of cutting body hair. It does the job well from the chest down. Occasionally it might give you some nicks so always be careful.&lt;br /&gt;The combs that come with it are totally useless. Tried them all and none worked. I guess they aren&#x27;t made to work with body hair which is the main purpose of the groomer. The charging time takes forever and eventually I&#x27;d remove it from electricity to use it.&lt;br /&gt;This groomer is nothing fancy but it&#x27;s still better than a regular blade and it&#x27;s inexpensive too so you get a bang for your buck. All in all it&#x27;s a good bargain.</li>
    <li> Description: Panasonic milano series men&#x27;s body shaver, use wet or dry and is washable, unique water shutters for quick and easy maintenance of the shaver, rubberized grip, includes AC recharger (indicator light), cleaning brush and 3 comb attachments, measures: 6.7 inches (H) x 1.8 inches (W) x 1.8 inches (L), 5.3 ounce, blue-silver finish, replacement blade (WES9752P) and replacement foil (WES9775P).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why this is a man&#x27;s shaver except it&#x27;s blue and not pink. Seems to work just fine but it is definitely NOT FOR THE FACE. The speed and quality of this shaver is commendable. It&#x27;s easy to use and very easy to clean. The attachments snap on with no problem and come in just the right heights. My favorite part is that one can use it in the water. Dry shaving is not recommended with this shaver. The handle&#x27;s rubber grip is nice and the size is perfect. The charger is solidly built and holds the shaver well - not falling over like most chargers. Batter life seems to be good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it gives a close shave but not nearly as close as a razor. Panasonic makes good products and this one is no exception. You can pay many times more for a electric shaver but for the price I think you&#x27;ll be happy with this one.</li>
    <li> This is a body \\&quot;shaver\\&quot;,and works on lighter growth and touch ups. For heavy growth try the pop up \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; first to thin it out, then use the shaver function. Some will prefer a more powerful trimmer [without the outer foil protection] which is designed to allow removed hair to drop immediately and thus cut down on dragging and clogs. [This shaver might make things smoother after heavy growth is removed.] The rubberized handle is comfortable and easily gripped even when wet. No reason why this wouldn&#x27;t be suitable for ladies as well. Rechargeable and 3 comb attachments.</li>
    <li> I use this for both face and body, it works great.  Simple to use, charges fairly quickly and lasts pretty long while working on body shaving.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Not very good wet or dry</li>
    <li> I have owned many panasonic shavers and this was not up to par in comparison. While it has great aesthetic appeal, it is an over all weak shaver. The pop up trimmer is flimsy, the motor is weak, and the intended contour design was awkward with an over exaggerated angle. It hasn&#x27;t completely turned me off from panansonic because I believe in their products. This one however, is a dud.</li>
    <li> Looks good, but does a terrible job trimming.  On a full charge still doesn&#x27;t trim as it should.  Less than three months later I&#x27;m buy a different trimmer....wish I could return. :-(</li>
    <li> Chinese meat grinder....!</li>
    <li> It just doesn&#x27;t work well; the blade seems to be so small/hidden that it won&#x27;t effectively cut hair. I&#x27;ve used a Wahl trimmer in the past and it was much more effective.</li>
    <li> Good looking device but additional plastic heads doesn&#x27;t work, so as body shaverit not working. Another places this body shaver selling for $80, what waist of money</li>
    <li> Do not waste your time purchasing this piece of crap!! I have never had any luck with a foil razor. all it does is pull your hair. I catch my self having to use the pop-up black all of the time and go very very slow. takes hours to shave a man&#x27;s hairy body. I&#x27;m going back to a Wahl razor from Wal-Mart at least those take less time.</li>
    <li> After using the body shaver for about 3 weeks, I must say this body shaver definitely does its job. The way the shaver is designed allows for a comfortable handle while shaving my body especially with the rubberized grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with 3 comb attachments, which I find useful for certain parts of the body. They work as supposed to and keeps my hair evenly groomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that these Panasonic grooming products are all wet/dry. I can wash the product without a problem and the faucet&#x27;s waterflow is enough to clean all the hairs in the shaver. The charging stand is cool as its integrated with the entire \\&quot;Milano\\&quot; line, which allows me to charge all three products on the same charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This body trimmer performs perfectly. I would rate it a 10/10.</li>
    <li> I got this to keep as a spare for my son when he comes to visit. He often leaves his shaver at home (700 miles away) so this helps him stay clean shaven when visiting. stays charged for reasonable period and provides a nice shave.</li>
    <li> Compact, Great value for the price. Strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> Nice little item and if you&#x27;re older than fifty like me it helps .  Hair keeps cropping up all over in weird places and this is a nifty little gadget to fight it. Great for ear lobe hair.</li>
    <li> Love the fact that I can shave with it in the shower, and get a good clean shave on my face, too.  Using it dry is \\&quot;okay\\&quot;, but prefer using it in the shower.  For us older guys, a few quick passes over the ears gets rid of the hair there, too.  Bonus -- the Mrs. uses it on her legs in the shower and she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;m not thrilled with is the trimmer. I have to move it slow or it tends to grab/pull hair.  Also, the 3 / 6 / 9 millimeter spacers are actually somewhat limiting.  It&#x27;d be nice if they had other spacer sizes available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit cleans easy --- just slide open the unit&#x27;s cover plate under the tap or in the shower and everything flushes right out.  Couldn&#x27;t be easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as charging goes, it&#x27;s good for roughly 4 uses per charge, so it&#x27;d work fine for a weekend trip!  While at home I just keep it in the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to emphasize that even though it&#x27;s a body shaver, it also does a great job on my face.  Hint: To make it an easy and smooth shave out of the shower I dampen my face and apply 3 drops of Shave Secret  //  Link: [[ASIN:B0023XF60Q SHAVE SECRET SHAVING OIL- THE BEST SHAVE EVER! 18.75ML]]  Very smooth shave with that.</li>
    <li> This is an attractive-looking body shaver with charger. However, the sleek and lightweight design cannot hide its flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exposed blade of the trimmer quickly snags-even with guard on (3 different sizes provided). The shaver doesn&#x27;t cut very well and sometimes feels dangerous. Using the water drain method shown, it doesn&#x27;t get very clean-just messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, I&#x27;m actually missing my disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were hopeful, but the Panasonic \\&quot;Milano\\&quot; body shaver is too scary a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband was in a bind today. The disposables weren&#x27;t around. He grabbed it having no alternative and took a chance...It worked better for him, even with no guard installed. Though he wasn&#x27;t thrilled about having to go over his face a couple times (due to shorter blade length, although it was easily maneuverable) &amp; he didn&#x27;t like the side that pops out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver worked when he needed it to. He shaved his facial stubble quickly without drawing blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, we find it OK for the face when in need. However, you may want to opt for something else for longer hair, especially when body shaving.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver hoping for an upgrade from my 8 year old trimmer that does similar duties. I thought it was cool that you could use it under the shower. I did a pretty thorough test both dry and wet, here are the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1-With no attachment it shaves body hair really close, if you&#x27;re going for the smooth look this is good.&lt;br /&gt;#2-It is indeed waterproof and can be used under the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, now the downsides that really make this product bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1-OUCH! Yeah, it rips hairs out at random. It even drew blood on one. Watch your undercarriage gents, this could hurt!&lt;br /&gt;#2-The attachements that come with it don&#x27;t allow for enough adjustment. You&#x27;ve got bald, 3mm and 2 others that you wouldn&#x27;t use unless you&#x27;re a sasquatch.&lt;br /&gt;#3-The trim is inconsistant. You&#x27;ve got to go over each area several times to get it trimmed. Underarms were particularly difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t in good faith recommend this item, it&#x27;s painful and doesn&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
    <li> This Panasonic Body Shaver is a life saver for me but upon reading all the reviews here I think it is not suited for everybody.  I have been forever trying to find a suitable razor or trimmer for my chest and back hair.  A man&#x27;s body.  I have purchased many beard/hair trimmers hoping they would work that just didn&#x27;t cut it.  When I saw this and saw how it was packaged showing just what I wanted it for on the box - shaving a man&#x27;s body - I was thrilled.  And everything about it has been great for me.  It doesn&#x27;t tug when I trim.  Being able to use it in wet/dry conditions is a definite bonus.  But it seems others are trying to use it for many functions as I myself tried with other products in the past.  I don&#x27;t use this unit on my face at all and would not recommend it for a woman to use in shaving her legs.  I find it to be well built, efficient and sturdy but meant for harder jobs and not delicate detail work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily for me it does what I need it to do and works perfect on my body hair but when I also read how they advertise it I think it is not fully suited for all they describe.  Again, not for delicate shaving or trimming.  For me the box itself showed the unit for what it was and the worded description definitely might mislead some.  I definitely recommend this for a man to use in trimming body hair but recommend definite caution to woman or men looking for a more refined shaver.</li>
    <li> Having a lot of Panasonic products around the house, from TV &amp; Blu Ray player to microwave and various other electronics, I believe this is a good product from a great company. This body shaver is my latest addition and I can say it really looks and feels cool. It does the job, but it does not do it as good as I&#x27;ve hoped for. I tried it on for a few weeks, I even let my wife use it on her legs, and the same problem persists: the shave is not close enough, and it does not compete with a good old fashioned blade. I&#x27;ve used other body shavers in the past, and I can not say that there was one that performed better than this one. The Norelco shaver I use for my face gives me a much closer shave, yet that is only for the face, and it could be that I my skin needs adjusting to this type of body shaver. If you&#x27;re not concerned with having the closest shave, this one does a great job and it works relatively fast even in the shower, which for me is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing for first time users: don&#x27;t expect the indicator to inform you of the full charge - the first time I charged it I waited 48 hours and still no change in the indicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:(7 months later) - it took some time but I am more adjusted to this shaver. I actually like to use it more than the first month or two.</li>
    <li> I was torn between this razor and a Philips product. Honestly I chose because I saw good references in Men&#x27;s health magazine . However, this shaver does not work with the clippers and did not satisfy my expectations. Not worth buying.</li>
    <li> In terms of look, this body razor has a nice style.  In terms of performance and function, one of the big advantages here is this is a wet or dry razor and it lives up to that billing.  It performs well for its intended purpose and having a pop up and foil type razor with attachment combs of various sizes provides a versatile grooming tool.  If used properly it will not nick or irritate; however, with longer hairs it can tug and rip a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grip is excellent and this has a nice feel and balance in the hand.  The instructions are well written in an age where that seems to be a lost art.  This is exceptionally easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like that there is no indicator to let you know when the device is fully charged; that is an oversight too many products make these days.  It also seems to take an excessive amount of time to charge.  The battery is not serviceable so once it dies so does the razor.  I also think more range in sizes than the three included (3mm or 0.12\\&quot;, 6mm or 0.24\\&quot;, 9mm or 0.35\\&quot;) would have been a nice touch (particularly on the smaller mm scale of things).  Also, some case or container to hold these combs / guides is always helpful.</li>
    <li> Rating: 4.25 stars.&lt;br /&gt;This review is for the Panasonic ER-GK40-S \\&quot;Milano\\&quot; Men&#x27;s Adjustable Cordless Body Shaver. The body shaver works well, but isn&#x27;t perfect. The shaver cuts at skin level, not under the skin level like a face shaver would. But that&#x27;s probably a good thing. I have a lot of body hair and it&#x27;s coarse. I normally use a hair clipper to shave my body hair, but this body shaver will cut the hair at the skin level. Within three days I could already see the hair back to the level a hair clipper cuts it at so I didn&#x27;t benefit greatly from this shaver. Others who have little body hair that grows slowly will benefit more. The shaver does a good job of shaving, and for me it did the best job of cutting when the head was completely flat against my skin. No angle necessary. I just had to run over my skin a few times due to the amount of hair and the coarseness. But that&#x27;s my situation. It may work better for others. I have not used the shaver wet. I don&#x27;t plan on it neither.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaver: The body shaver is 6.5\\&quot; H. At the top where the blade is located, the width is 1.75\\&quot;, while the thinner/narrower part of the body is 1.25\\&quot; W.  I have medium sized hands and even though the shaver is narrow/thin, it fits comfortably in my hands. The noise level is at a medium level. The bottom has a retractable edging blade for making lines. The top has a flap which pushes down and opens up to let water flow through to clean the head. Personally, I remove the head and wash it separately and then lightly run water over the blade.  The head snaps back on and stays snug, as does the plastic cover that covers the head. I had to charge the shaver about 18 to 24 hours before using. I&#x27;ve used it for 6 hours over 6 times and it&#x27;s still going. The build quality is strong, made of hard silver plastic and blue plastic with a light rubber coating which does a great job of providing grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Base: The charging base 2\\&quot; W x 4.5\\&quot;H x 3.5\\&quot; D.  The wire is 71\\&quot; long, just one inch short of 6 feet. The shaver sits vertically in the cradle. The two silver contacts on both side of the shaver make contact with the silver panels on the sides of the cradle, and the red LED at the bottom illuminates to show the device is charging.  LED turns off when charging completes or when shaver is removed.</li>
    <li> the product is the one that was seen in the photos, excellent quality, portable, durable, original, impressive both in body and face shaved, right cost, meets all the specifications it says the seller on the page, come to the site in its original packaging , well presented, and preserved, without any kind of detail, I can recommend the seller and the product with eyes closed, as they demonstrate that they comply with everything, it really is excellent</li>
    <li> good as i thought, easy to use and clean&lt;br /&gt;but the adapt only support 110V, so I have to buy a transformer for it when I used it abroad.</li>
    <li> This cordless Panasonic ER-Gk40-S was my first body shaver, though I&#x27;ve been using a standard electric shaver on my face for many years.  Overall, I was very impressed with this product.  It&#x27;s quiet and powerful, and after a week&#x27;s worth of regular shaves, I have not had to recharge the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works as advertised, can be used for the face and body, and probably functions just as well as the more expensive Norelco shaver that I&#x27;ve been using for many years - with one exception.  The trimmer is not quite as good as my Norelco, but it is still serviceable.  I have not taken advantage of the wet shave options, but it&#x27;s certainly nice to have that available.  This is a small shaver, and would probably work well for travel.  It is not the most elaborate or most expensive shaver available, but it works well, does everything I need it to do, and it&#x27;s sleek and attractive on my bathroom sink.  I can&#x27;t ask for much more than that.</li>
    <li> This was a very disappointing shave when I went to shave my chest, your better off just getting a Wahl shaver and living with stubble instead of a smooth chest ! Save your money !</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product as my husband has used it and liked it.  He told me that it gave him a clean and smooth shave. I would also like to add that it feels pretty sturdy, yet it&#x27;s relatively light and compact and it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room on the bathroom vanity. Also, it comes in handy when you travel.</li>
    <li> I used this to shave my legs, I really liked that I could use it in the bath &amp; shower, the wet-dry feature is pretty cool.  The shaver was easy for me to hold and was comfortable in my hand.  It got the job done but did pull at the hair a little.  The shave wasn&#x27;t terribly close but I don&#x27;t think electric razors ever are.  I don&#x27;t have a lot to compare this to, but the personal groomer I previously had recently broke (it was poorly made and basically disposable).  This seems like a nicely made product that should last a while, certainly longer than the last one I had.</li>
    <li> As a body shaver, see another review...my husband wasn&#x27;t feeling into that...but as a facial shaver, I do have some comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it&#x27;s very sleek and charges rapidly.  When used on the face, it doesn&#x27;t give that sort of shiny, fresh shaved look that you find with a razor, but for an electric shaver, it was close and clean.  The weird thing is that the shave lasted longer than the previous electric shaver he had AND longer than a razor shave.  The width is narrower and it isn&#x27;t as chunky as the Norelco he used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also much quieter than the two previous electric razors he&#x27;s used, and is weighted comfortably so if you actually wanted to do some major manscaping you could.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used an electric shaver for most of my adult life (rarely use razors, except on special occasions when I need a super-close shave), but have never used a foil-type razor until now. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this shaver, but I was IMPRESSED and am now using this exclusively... I gave my old Philips triple-headed shaver to my dad. This is just way better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;+ small size means this fits more easily into a travel bag&lt;br /&gt;+ high power -- the foil is actually more effective at shaving my chin/neck beard than my old electric razor. It&#x27;s not extremely close, so I need to use it daily to keep reasonably clean-shaven, but it&#x27;s powerful enough to mow through several days&#x27; worth of stubble if you miss some shaves&lt;br /&gt;+ great pop-up trimmer -- tested this on my chest, works great for precision trimming. I&#x27;m not a &#x27;mansculptor&#x27; so I don&#x27;t envision myself using this, but it will give you a close, smooth trim if so desired&lt;br /&gt;+ charging stand looks nice in the bathroom (vs the normal plug-in cables which can appear messy)&lt;br /&gt;+ solidly constructed... feels dense and well-made&lt;br /&gt;+ water resistant, so you can rinse it out or use it in the shower without worrying&lt;br /&gt;+ ergonomic design, comfortable to hold and use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;+ charging stand can be a pain to pack if you have to go on travel&lt;br /&gt;+ foil head isn&#x27;t as great at handling contoured areas as well as the independent-head shavers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE:&lt;br /&gt;As your primary daily shaver or &#x27;mansculpting&#x27; tool, this is a quality choice. It&#x27;s well-made, compact, and effective at getting the job done.</li>
    <li> This really works on the arm hair.  I just wish they would make them in purple or pink.  I think if they did, they would sell more and expand their market.  The hair doesn&#x27;t seem to grow back fast either.</li>
    <li> I was expecting this to cut as close as a razor, but it does not cut nearly as close as I expected.</li>
    <li> This Panasonic Body Shaver looks very nice.  The grip is excellent and the charging stand holds the shaver very well.  I too, like many others, think it is not suited for everybody trying to do everything.  I just wanted a good razor or trimmer for my chest and back hair.  That&#x27;s it.  And I must say, for me, it works just fine.  It doesn&#x27;t tug when I trim.  So far I have not used it wet, but being able to use it in wet conditions cool.  This product seems to be marketed for the body, and I only use it that way.  I don&#x27;t shave my face with it and don&#x27;t think a woman should use it for her legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It performs well for body grooming, has a pop up and foil type razor with different attachment combs.  Charging does take some time, but it holds the charge well.  Again, I would not use this for close, face like shaving, but only for body grooming.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ER-GK40-S body shaver is a fantastic product for those who don&#x27;t want to use a razor blade and scissors. It has long battery life, charges overnight on its stand, and has plenty of power to do its intended grooming chores. The shaving head on it is not as wide as an electric razor meant for the face, so it is much more maneuverable and easy to manage. The trimmer section is on par with other trimmers and does an excellent job of clipping longer body hair without gumming up or bogging down. While it can be used wet or dry, I&#x27;ve found its easier to use it dry, and gentle enough to not cause any irritation. The contoured body and rubberized gripping area are well thought out, giving the user a firm, confident purchase of the shaver.</li>
    <li> I know this Panasonic is designed for men, but with the price of disposable shavers these days, I welcome an electric shaver for my legs over buying $12 disposable shaver refills. This shaver felt good in my (small) hands and has straight forward on/off buttons. I decided to try a dry shave on my legs. The trimmer is in front of the shaving screen and I found it would &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; on the hair before it went over the screen. That&#x27;s an uncomfortable shave (how many shaver commercials empasize a _comfortable_ shave -- it&#x27;s important).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried the trimmer alone and it also tugged a bit and wasn&#x27;t comfortable. I have used a norelco electric shaver with a trimmer and never had a bit of discomfort, unlike this shaver. The shaver itself is well-designed with a slot to rinse the blade from inside, and easy access to the inside rotating blade. No issues with cleaning or replacing parts.</li>
    <li> This body shaver has some things it does really well, but it falls short on other aspects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*The trimmer without the plastic combs works fairly well, and if you need to remove hair before shaving it smooth, it gets the job done. Now, if the hair is more than an inch long it will pull it, but that&#x27;s expected.&lt;br /&gt;*The shaver works well, both dry and wet. My armpits and abs were smooth after using it there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*When using the trimmer with the combs, this product is basically useless. it just does not work properly and you will just end up wasting your time. In this aspect, my [[ASIN:B0037HP9OA Philips Norelco BG2040 BodyGroom Pro]] gets a big plus compared to this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;*The battery gets drained super fast. I tries using it to trim the hair in my legs before shaving it, and the charge would only be enough to get one leg done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have to say that if I have to pick between this Shaver and the Norelco BG2040, I would choose the latter one, but having both is useful, especially due the the trimmer capabilities without the comb that the Panasonic product has.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several Panasonic razors (including the [[ASIN:B005DKKBRY Panasonic ES-LT41-K Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Black/Silver]]) and have liked them very much. I wasn&#x27;t sure about a \\&quot;body shaver\\&quot; as the picture on the box highlights the underarms, chest, groin, and legs. However Panasonic states that the ER-GK40 Wet/Dry Body Shaver is \\&quot;all-in-one cordless shaver for overall body grooming... that makes grooming anywhere on your body easy.\\&quot;  However my 2 cents worth is that in an attempt to make a jack-of-all-trades shaver that did everything, it doesn&#x27;t really do anything well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re directed to charge the shaver for 23 hours the first time. Thereafter it requires a 15 hour charge. The manual states that a full charge should provide for 4 shaves assuming 7 minutes per shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included with the shaver are 3 comb attachments, 1/8\\&quot;, 1/4\\&quot;, and 3/8\\&quot;.  But note that the instructions state that if you&#x27;re cutting hair longer than 3/16\\&quot; or 0.2\\&quot;, you should use the pop-up trimmer to cut the hair first. So then what it the purpose of the 1/4\\&quot; and 3/8\\&quot; comb attachments?  Also, I tried both the pop-up trimmer and the 1/8\\&quot; foil on the hair on the back of my neck and I have to say that the Panasonic just didn&#x27;t cut it. It just didn&#x27;t do well at removing the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since Panasonic states that this shaver can be used anywhere on the body, I wanted to find out if I could use the 1/8\\&quot; comb attachment to keep my beard looking like I had a 3 day beard. So after I went without shaving for about 5 days, I attached the 1/8\\&quot; comb attachment to determine if I could cut my beard down to 1/8\\&quot;. What I noticed first is that the ER-GK40 is a much slower than the 13,000 RPM linear motor on my regular Panasonic shaver. The second thing that really caught my attention was that the ER-GK40 was pulling out way too many whiskers. I wanted to cut off the ends of the whiskers, not pull them out. So that terminated theidea of going back to a 3 day-looking beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife tried the ER-GK40 on her legs and said that it did OK for an electric shaver but there was still a little stubble.  So it was not as smooth as a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your mileage may vary but I did not find that the ER-GK40 lived up to Panasonic&#x27;s claim that this \\&quot;all-in-one cordless shaver ... makes grooming anywhere on your body easy.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> My husband and I were hoping for a better bodygrooming experience (for him), but he found this shaver quite uncomfortable.  He said it felt like the shaver was pulling the hair vs. cutting it.  He tried it in several body areas and none of them were comfortable, so he went back to using his [[ASIN:B003U8ESI4 Philips Norelco QT4070 Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Mustache Trimmer Pro]].  He has been using that product for a couple of years now and, especially on longer hairs, it performs better than this groomer.  After we had him fairly trimmed up with the Norelco, we tried this Panasonic body shaver again and it was only then, when the hair was already trimmed very short, that he could tolerate this shaver.  He still had to go quite slowly over the skin to avoid the tugging sensation. I suspect he&#x27;s going to continue to rely on his Norelco trimmer for most of his manscaping needs; however, if this shaver grows on him, I&#x27;ll come back and update the review.  For now though - just okay.</li>
    <li> Panasonic was always known for their \\&quot;set shavers\\&quot; and this one was designed for men to use in the shower.  This is something that most Norelco models won&#x27;t do and it does a decent job, if you don&#x27;t mind a few passes here and there.  However, when it comes to dry performance, it is not up to par with Norelco shavers.  Just like when wet, you mind need a few passes for a desired result and as we know: More passes equals more chances of irritation later on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning it is a breeze since chances are you are already under running water.  Just pop the top and rinse it away.  Charging stand is included, but no carrying pouch(which is no biggie if you don&#x27;t plan to take it on the road with you.)  Ultimately this a decent buy if you do your shaving in the shower.</li>
    <li> After using this for a few months, I have to say that this is best suited as a travel shaver. You can use it on your face and use it to keep your body hair in check while on the road. Two birds, one stone. Perfect. However, for home use, I always seem to opt to use something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has several things going for it... It&#x27;s compact and cordless, and includes blade guides for trimming. It can be used wet or dry, which is nice again for travel, so you can clean it out easily with much fuss. Inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also a few strikes against it... Takes forever to fully charge at least 12 hours, but more like a full day. The trimmer could be better. The motor seems to vibrate at a very slow rate. Go slow or prepare for painful tugging. Though it works on trimming body hair, the slow rate at which you have to clip makes it no less convenient than using a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not bad for the price, but for just a little more money you can certainly do a lot better.  Good if you want a cheap travel razor, for daily home use, I&#x27;d go for something else.</li>
    <li> cut my body and doesn&#x27;t shave it !!&lt;br /&gt;i even tried to put the soap on the shaver and on my body it&#x27;s useless</li>
    <li> I really like this shaver for trimming body hairs. I was happy to see someone actually thought \\&quot;Hey, what if we sold something that encouraged men to groom themselves\\&quot; considering it&#x27;s 2013, and about darn time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one bad thing I noticed about the shaver is my skin doesn&#x27;t really feel great after trimming. Also, they have potential to cause ingrown hairs (just like regular razors do), so there&#x27;s no real benefit there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these get the job done. The most comfortable body grooming to me comes in standard trimmer form, but this is a good alternative option for those who want to get closer to the skin.</li>
    <li> I had a Phillips Norelco body shaver for 3 years, and felt there had to be something better out there. Well, I found it. The Panasonic Milano Series ER-GK40-S. It is far superior in every aspect, overall quality, feels great in your hand and on your skin, and gets a really close shave. For all of the guys who love to manscape this is the one for you.</li>
    <li> I own a lot of Panasonic products and I usually like their products.  This shaver, however, leaves much to be desired.  I tested it against a 3 year old high end Panasonic regular electric shaver.  I usually shave my face dry, but I did it with a wet, soapy face as the instructions described.  The Milano motor nearly came to a stop against 2 days of stubble.  My beard isn&#x27;t terribly thick either.  My older shaver glided through the other half of my face without slowing down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did the same test on my chest hair.  I didn&#x27;t have the same problem with the motor bogging down because there isn&#x27;t that much hair.  It just didn&#x27;t do a very good job and I ended up finishing up with my older shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Milano also came with attachments to give yourself a haircut.  I put on one of the attachments, which did not go on very easily.  I attempted to trim my hair, but it was apparent that this thing wasn&#x27;t going to do the job.  Kind of a joke.  The trimmer clippers would be fine for squaring off your sideburns, but that is it.  They are exactly like any other electric shaver trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Sleek, easy to grip, easy to clean, price, battery holds charge for many shaves&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Noisy, does not cut well, weak motor</li>
    <li> My husband loves to use the Panasonic Milano body shaver in the shower.  It cleans very easily - just rinse under water.  The razor works well on both facial and body hair, but the trimmer is not quite up to par.  It catches hair sometimes and kind of tugs at it, especially where the hair becomes thicker.  You can actually hear the motor slow a little bit when he is trimming thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge will last for about 2-3 uses and if the charge runs out, it takes an incredibly long time to charge (8-10 hours.  It&#x27;s best to just leave it in the charger, but if you have limited counter space, that can be a bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this is a good shaver, and you can&#x27;t beat the wet/dry uses.</li>
    <li> Ok, let&#x27;s face it, body hair is gross.  Any time I get the chance to try out a new groomer/trimmer I get it.  I think I have four in my bathroom currently.  This was the first Panasonic groomer I have used.  I was excited at the prospect because I have a Panasonic face razor that I LOVE. This shaver is great if you&#x27;re just going straight skin and BONUS it&#x27;s waterproof so you can manscape in the shower.  The only gripe I have, and it&#x27;s significant, is the guards for this.  They&#x27;re 1/8\\&quot;, 1/4\\&quot; and 3/8\\&quot;.  I don&#x27;t know about you, but 3/8\\&quot; body hair is like a shag carpet.  And 1/8\\&quot; just isnt close enough.  Charging time seems to take FOREVER also, so if you&#x27;re trying to trim everything from the neck down in one shot, good luck.  Better grab a pair of clippers.</li>
    <li> Overall, this razor works fine with any of the same limitations as other electric razors. It does shave reasonably close, but can&#x27;t compare to a regular, straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The larger holes in the foil allow longer hairs through, however I do find that they tend to snag in heavier areas which can irritate my skin while shaving. The side trimmer is fairly sturdy, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better than one on a dedicated face shaver. The rubberized grip is nice, as is the wet/dry feature, which makes for easy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging dock is somewhat bulky. Having limited bathroom counter space, I don&#x27;t really need another \\&quot;presentation\\&quot; style charger/holder, just a port to plug it in. The large charging base is also annoying to travel with (for those long trips).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t tend to use this razor very regularly (maybe every few weeks), so I can&#x27;t really judge how well it holds a charge, but it does seems to have enough juice for the job.</li>
