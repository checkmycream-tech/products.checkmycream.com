    <li> [[VIDEOID:d1276808cd637a1dd31c356e18fb9e28]]I like the Beauty Blender Makeup Sponge because it felt really nice on my face. It blended my makeup perfectly. It was easy to hold and easy to use. I loved the bottom of the sponge because of the large size for blending my foundation on larger areas of my face and neck. The top teardrop shaped piece was ideal for use around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Beauty Blender Makeup Sponge comes two to a pack - and each one is individually wrapped in plastic so it remains clean and bacteria free until you open it up. Then just place the makeup application sponges in a bowl of warm water, turn it once or twice to let it absorb as much water as it can. The Beauty Blender Makeup Sponge easily doubles in size once it has absorbed plenty of water. When you get ready to use it, squeeze the water out without twisting it then wrap a clean paper towel around it again and squeeze once more. Now the makeup application sponges are ready to use. Dot the foundation and concealer on your face - one item at a time - and use the Beauty Blender Makeup Sponge to blend the makeup into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you are done using your makeup sponge applicators wash them gently making sure all the excess makeup is removed from the sponge. It is ok if they are discolored but be sure the water runs clean. Set your sponge aside where it can get plenty of air and let it dry naturally. Even though these makeup application sponges are made of non-latex, anti-microbial material that inhibits the growth of bacteria it is important to properly care for your Beauty Blender Makeup Sponge so the bacteria has no fuel to begin growing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Beauty Blender Makeup Sponge really is easy to use - and makes applying makeup faster because you don&#x27;t end up with the streaks or clumps you do when you use your fingers. These makeup application sponges work perfectly with liquid, cream &amp; powder makeup plus they work well on all skin types - dry, oily or sensitive. Pick a pack up today and find out for yourself!out for yourself!</li>
    <li> I admit it, I am a geek that couldn&#x27;t before now use a makeup blender to save my life. I didn&#x27;t have to though before, I didn&#x27;t feel old. Now I feel old and trying to catch up on the current and best beauty products so I am forced to try a lot of everything to get down to just the things I really love and feel I really need. I needed this makeup blender sponge because putting cover up and high lighter creams on and then blending with applicators that those products come with was messy. Plus most of the products I have been trying come with no applicators at all. With this sponge I am able to dot my face with the areas needing certain products and then blend it all in with this blender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The box comes with two makeup application sponges and so far I have only used one over and over. I have tried it both dry and damp and damp works better, though I worried it would add liquid to my face and counteract the creams, it didn&#x27;t. Do make sure to rinse off the sponge because even though you can&#x27;t see it, science tells us that all kinds of things can grow on make up surfaces. Don&#x27;t squeeze it out but do run it through hot water and leave it some place to air dry well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was given this product without charge in order to review it!</li>
    <li> These makeup sponges are super easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;I have a special needs sister that I take care of, and I definitely help put on her makeup and other things she needs to feel like a lady.&lt;br /&gt;This sponge has definitely helped me out greatly! What&#x27;s even better is that she grab hold of these sponges without any issue at all.&lt;br /&gt;It fits perfectly into her fingertips, and she doesn&#x27;t have to struggle. She has poor eye-hand coordination, so she needs things that she can&lt;br /&gt;really grab hold of without struggle. I will still need to help her put her foundation on, but I don&#x27;t need to be the main one to apply it onto her face!&lt;br /&gt;So, we both love the design.&lt;br /&gt;I really like how super easy it is to clean. I have to throw away so many different makeup sponges, and I think we finally found one that we can count on to last a little longer than the others we have had.&lt;br /&gt;Great job on a wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;We received this product for a deep discount to give our honest &amp; unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I have really gotten into makeup over the last 3 or 4 years. What I mean by that is, more than just foundation and powder. I have worked with blending shades; I even figured out that I wear two different shades of foundation and I have pink undertones. Crazy, I know! One of the things that I strive to better is blending. I started out by using my fingers but quickly realized that not only does it not really even out the tones but it seems to take forever and it is bad for your skin. I then went to those cheap foam things that look like a mini bike ramp. The problem with the mini ramps is that I feel like I lose a lot of my products and I can’t figure out how to actually clean them. So, I changed my tactic and went with brushes. I like the brushes, I really do, but I literally feel as though I am painting my makeup on. Yeah, end in the end I am really not as big of a fan as I thought that I was. A few people have mentioned using a makeup blender sponge so I figured I would give them a try. They all really seem to like them and they love that you simply rinse them out between uses and let them dry. Read that to mean, you rinse it in water, squeeze it gently to get the water out, and then store the sponge in a cool, dry place. Sounds pretty simple, easy cleanup, I’m definitely game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was recently introduced to the Beautyfullness Makeup Blender Sponge and I absolutely LOVE it. This is a non-streaking makeup application sponge that allows me to blend my bronzers, powders, and foundations so I am able to achieve a more evenly distributed and natural look. With the makeup sponge I am able to get in the crease of my nose and right to my hair line, without caking it into the crease as well as all over my hair. What’s even better is it is made of a non-latex, anti microbial foam, which is great for me since I have sensitive skin and have the comfort of knowing that my makeup sponge does not contain anything that will agitate my skin or get hidden and irritate it later on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I am kind of strange when it comes to my makeup products, I wasn’t a huge fan of the color of my Beautyfullness Makeup Blender Sponge when I first opened the box. My initial thought was that the sponge looked a little bland but I then quickly reminded myself that there are no added chemicals to bother my skin so I’ll give the color a pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A product that is packaged simply, user friendly, and at a great price point is a definite win in my book. You can’t go wrong trying the Beautyfullness Makeup Blender Sponge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review. Regardless, all opinions expressed are still 100% my own.</li>
    <li> The Beautyfullness makeup application sponges are pretty darn awesome. I enjoy that they are shaped like a teardrop making them ergonomically beneficial. Others are hard to hold b/c they are so skinny, but these from Beautyfullness fit right in my hand and are easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using mine with my foundation, and they really do a good job of helping me apply. I&#x27;m very picky about the types of sponges that I use, but these are anti-microbial -- and I appreciate that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these makeup sponges for help with applying your concealer or foundation evenly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for a 100% honest review.</li>
    <li> We have a teenage diva in our home who loves anything and everything that has to do with makeup.  She follows other teenage makeup divas (beauty bloggers) and works on her makeup effects daily. Beside purchasing all different brands of makeup she also searches for and purchases all of the tools necessary for making herself the best that she can be. She tries out different brands, types, colors, and tools necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time around she was introduced to makeup application tools especially sponges. She educated herself on all (some) of the many types, forms and brands of sponges and has tried out several of them.  She begged for one a littler different. You see the ones that she has used in the past were flat, round on the top and square on the bottom, washable and/or non washable but these were truly unique. Their shape is that of a tear drop with a round full yet flat on one end and on the other end in the shape of a tear drop.  Looks somewhat funny but man can they work.  You use the fuller end for cover the most area, your cheeks, forehead, and neck.  The teardrop end is for around the finer areas of your face....your nose, around your eyes and chin.  Easy to cover and blend; apply concealer, foundation or blusher. You can even use it with your eye makeup to blend in different levels or amount of colors and highlight your eyes to a new level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sponges are one of the best makeup tools around.  Personally, I like the concept of adding the instructions with the sponges on how to clean and maintain them. As we all know teenage girls are not the best listeners to adults and a little help from the manufacturer on how to clean and maintain something  that can cause so much damage to their skin and eyes says a lot about the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know I might even try to &amp;#34;borrow&amp;#34; one to use....sounds like a great idea.  I mean the quality that you get for the cost is terrific so if I get caught then I can buy some for myself.</li>
    <li> I love it!!  This makeup sponge doesn&#x27;t fall apart like others I have used before.  It works so much better when you get it wet before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to be pale and makeup often looks blotchy on me if not applied correctly, but I haven&#x27;t dealt with that with this sponge.  It&#x27;s great. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just put this on my gift list for my makeup loving friends.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this product.  First time using a blender sponge.  Read reviews and instructions and watched the tutorials before purchasing it but it doesn&#x27;t work as it should.  No matter what I do, it doesn&#x27;t blend the product or helps with the application.  Instead it thins and removes.  It may just be my inexperienced so I will keep trying to make it work and update my review if there are any changes.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe what a difference using this beauty blender sponge has made when I apply my makeup.  I feel like my makeup goes on smoother and the coverage is more even. I&#x27;ve used a variety of makeup brushes and sponges, but this is my favorite so far!!!</li>
    <li> I use this on pretty much a daily basis. I have to be careful on the items I use on my face as they have a tendency to irritate my skin. The moment I used this to blend, it was amazing. So smooth and soft. I felt like I was using silk against my face. It is a sponge so it does soak up a lot of the product I use, so I feel like I&#x27;m using more product than normal but honestly it smooths everything out so nicely.</li>
    <li> These work great! Will buy more if needed, seamless blending without exesive absorption of product. Shipped as promised, will be recommending to friends and family. Can be used for liquid or powder product.</li>
    <li> These Beauty blender make up sponges are amazing! It helps to apply my foundation evenly without a lot of waste to my foundation. They are easy to use and easy to bring with me on the go. I like how easy they are to blend and have not noticed any lines around my jawline after putting it on. Easy to clean with a little soap it seems if you need to switch to a different color foundation with the changing seasons.</li>
    <li> Sometimes, I really hate wearing makeup!  Why?  Because if you get the wrong color or try a new product, it can give you that “caked-on look.”  That is NOT the look I am going for.  I’m a pretty laid back, less is more kind of person when it comes to makeup.  I don’t have extra time to add layers to my face in the morning.  Using foundation is part of my morning routine. After using that applicator sponge for a few weeks, it gets pretty gross.  Now I have these fun Makeup Blender Sponges.  Yes, they look like eggs and that cracks me up (no pun intended) but they really are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing you need to do is get the sponge wet.  Gently squeeze the excess water out of it.  Then dab it into your foundation.  I use a cream type foundation from Mineral Hygenics and these Makeup Blender Sponges work amazing with it.  I’m sure they would work well with just about any type of foundation.  Change the amount of water that is left in the sponge according to how dry your foundation is.&lt;br /&gt;You can see here that I used the bigger end of the sponge.  It is perfect for most of your face.  When you want to get under your eyes or near your nose, use the smaller end of the sponge.  Because you used extra moisture when applying your makeup, you don’t end up with that line on your neck.  Of course, that only happens to me if I buy a color that is too dark for my white and freckled skin.&lt;br /&gt;When you are finished with your Beauty Blender Makeup Application Sponge, rinse it out and gently squeeze the water out of it.  Be sure not to twist it too hard.  If you use it as directed, it will last a few months.  Store it in a cool, dry place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I didn’t mention was that these fun Beauty Blender Sponges are latex-free.  I do have issues with adhesive tape so it makes me feel good to know I have nothing to worry about with these makeup application sponges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And… I love the wording on the package: Look Beautiful because you are more thanworth it!  What a great thought to start your day!</li>
    <li> This is a nice sponge. I do not wear make-up so I can not speak to that use. What I used this for was for painting. It does a great job. It holds a lot of paint with out dripping all over your project. It is great for blending chalk and pastels as well. It cleans out nicely and does take a little while to dry.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to hold shape in your hand make handling it for long periods of time helpful.&lt;br /&gt;A great little too for crafting.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality product and they are at a really good price, since my wife has a very sensitive skin she needs to change her makeup sponge often so I got this for her and she really liked them</li>
    <li> It works beautifully.</li>
    <li> My early days of makeup included only blush, lipstick and mascara so when I started to expand my make-up ritual to include foundation and powder, I was learning as I went along.  Starting of course with finger application, I was left with streaks of course, so I switched to a powder foundation... except that as I got older, the powder would settle into the fine lines and wrinkles my children have so graciously given me over the years.  I&#x27;ve heard that applying foundation with a brush is better than fingers but I still saw streaks and uneven coverage making me self-conscious about my face. When I was offered a discount code to try the Beautyfullness Makeup Blender Sponge, I figured I&#x27;d see what all the fuss was. I had heard others sing the praises of a beauty blender makeup sponge for it&#x27;s even coverage and ease in application, but had never tried it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the fact that 2 makeup sponges come in a pack is a wonderful thing - here&#x27;s why:  To apply your foundation, you want to first get your makeup application sponge wet and squeeze out any excess water.  This helps the sponge to not soak up all of your foundation which is pricey enough as it is.  Then apply the foundation either directly to the sponge or on your face and blend first by bouncing the sponge on your skin.  Do not Rub!  Bounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also works with concealer and I apply both my concealer and foundation all at the same time - dotting the concealer in my trouble areas because apparently &amp;#34;almost 40&amp;#34; is a great time for your face to start breaking out in addition to the dark spots that pop up out of nowhere.  The remaining water in the sponge helps with blending and leaves me feeling fresher than traditional applications while still offering complete coverage.  I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s science behind it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use your sponge for flawless application of cream blush, tinted moisturizer, bronzer or whatever else you are sticking on your face.  Think that a beauty blender makeup sponge is only for makeup?  You&#x27;d be wrong - I use it to apply my sunscreen first so that too has even coverage and my face stays protected.  Don&#x27;t forget to blend down your neckline and ears so that you don&#x27;t look like you are wearing a mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are like me, mistakes happen and that&#x27;s why I love having two sponges in this pack.  I use one wet for application, but the dry one can be used to erase those mistakes.  Like magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The egg shaped sponge is easy to hold and use with the wider edge perfect for full face coverage and the pointy end is perfect for careful maneuvering around the eyes and nose or any other tight spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material is latex free and soft to the touch which is important since the skin on your face can be sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this makeup application sponge and the ease of use and will not revert to any other type of application now that I&#x27;ve seen the light.t a beauty blender makeup sponge is only for makeup?

    <li> Works very very well, I&#x27;m so glad I made this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;These sponges even made me like foundations in my collection that I&#x27;ve never liked.&lt;br /&gt;Made my foundation go on smoothly and didn&#x27;t highlight pores or dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Love this item</li>
    <li> Good product. It&#x27;s a little small for my liking, but does the job well and great value for the price! Will certainly purchase again.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:8f11cdfd85809bca78dd7cfc3224ead7]]Great makeup sponge! [[ASIN:B00SCQVRQK Beautyfullness Makeup Blender Sponge - Non-Latex, Non-Streaking Makeup Sponge Provides Perfect Blending Of Foundation Makeup - Unique Shape Allows Better Coverage Of Concealer Makeup In Difficult Areas - Anti-Microbial Foam Blocks Bacteria - Easy To Use...]] So much better than a typical makeup sponge. I won&#x27;t be going back to those old cheapies from WalMart, that&#x27;s for sure!&lt;br /&gt;I love that they&#x27;re uniquely shaped for the different facial areas, and absolutely cannot get over how well they blend! These are a new must-have in my beauty kit! When you moisten them, make sure to squeeze, not ring them to remove excess water.&lt;br /&gt;See my full video review http://youtu.be/7TWK5Hu9rgI of thhe Makeup Blender Sponge for comparison to how they blend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a considerable discount as compensation in exchange for an honest and thorough review.</li>
    <li> Love this non traditional shape. Easier to grip and hold.</li>
    <li> This blends my foundation beautifully! I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this sponge... i use it on all my Bridal Clients.. gives a nice flawless application just like the BB without that expensive price.. So worth it.! go get it now!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it yself but my finace seems to like it.. so that is okay for me.</li>
    <li> I love this!  Your makeup looks so smooth. No streaks.</li>
    <li> The only way to put on foundation is with this blender sponge. You use it with foundation or concealer and it helps to blend the makeup perfectly so it doesn&#x27;t mate.</li>
    <li> Great beauty makeup tool.  I used this blender sponge to apply liquid foundation.  It fits in the hand nicely.  Isn&#x27;t too squishy so is easy to hold.  The point is good for under the eyes, corners of the nose and around the lips.  The thicker part is great for dotting and spreading for a smooth and even coverage on the face.  They feel like good quality sponges and that they will last a while.  I like that the box comes with a 2-pack.  Always good to have a backup in case one is lost or dropped.  Directions said to get it wet first but I used it dry. I got some foundation on my palm, with my other hand, I dotted it around on my face then I used the sponge to blend it in on my forehead and face.  After that I applied powder cover up and then the rest of my makeup.  It all lasted all day and did not bleed when I was sweaty mid-day.  I would think these would be good for Halloween makeup, clown makeup, stage makeup and more. Update:  I used it to apply liquid foundation and It definitely seems to hold up nicely.  It has a firm sponge consistency and doesn&#x27;t flake or fall apart like the wedge ones.  I&#x27;ve used it for almost a month now and it is holding up well and I really like it.  I received this product for free (or a discounted price, whichever is applicable) in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I have been needing makeup sponges to go in my kit that I have been building up for a bit. As I haven&#x27;t had much makeup until recently I have been looking for things that work well and are worth the price. I did this get this as a reduced price for a review but I do plan on getting again when I need new ones. About these sponges , they are bigger than ones I have been used to and swell up when they get wet. They do work great,I have used one in putting on foundation.It gives a smooth finish and depending what area you covering will be what end of the sponge you will use. It was easier that I thought to wash out the sponge as most sponges are hard to wash this rinses out easily and dries fast.</li>
    <li> I bought this blender on Prime Day and have had some time to use it now. First, two of them come in the package, which I hadn&#x27;t realized and was pleasantly surprised at. Second, in full disclosure, I haven&#x27;t used the actual branded beauty blender sponge so I can&#x27;t offer a comparison. I am quite happy with this sponge, though. Previously I&#x27;d been using a stippled brush to put on my foundation. What I like about this sponge is that I use less product (I use Urban Decay Naked Skin, which is a liquid foundation) and it still gives great coverage. It took a little getting used to to get a technique down, but I feel pretty comfortable with it now. I use the broad end for the large cheek and forehead areas, and then turn it around and squish as necessary to get around the nose. I still apply my undereye concealer with my fingers, but I go in with this sponge afterwards and blend it out. It&#x27;s more gentle than a brush and it gives a nicer look overall for me. Great addition to my makeup collection.</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to use and keep clean</li>
    <li> I really love these sponges. They blend so well and have held up very well so far. If you wear foundation, do yourself a favor and buy these now.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t trade it! I use it every day!!</li>
    <li> The shape is just right to reach those hard to reach areas. Texture is smooth and blenders let you put make up on flawlessly. They expands quite a bit and work great with liquid foundation and concealer. Great product.</li>
    <li> What I really love about them is that  these blenders gives you smooth, professional looking results and are latex-free, hypoallergenic and safe for sensitive skin. Instructions how to use them are on the box which I didn&#x27;t really need as I know how to use them.  Great quality.</li>
    <li> Really like these makeup sponges. They work great. Thank you for sending quick and exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used one of these sponges before and wow what a difference it makes!  Love it.</li>
    <li> as good as the brand name, but cheaper</li>
    <li> I use this thru every step of my beauty regimen, from lotion &amp; serum to mineral foundation &amp; I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I did not use before I returned so I cannot review the product. I returned because I did not want a sponge made in China</li>
    <li> I must say these sponges love my skin and I love them they blend my makeup with little effort</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of these cool makeup sponges. They&#x27;ve become so much affordable these days.&lt;br /&gt;With the anti-microbial material they made of, I don&#x27;t have to worry about it becoming a source for different pathogens that could easily irritate my skin. Soapy water solution after each use would be sufficient to wash off dirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I love that this package comes with 2 makeup blender sponges, as I like to rotate them between uses: one is washed and cleaned and getting dried. The other is being in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though these sponges were initially created for Foundation use, I use them for my Powder products: rouge and concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A pointed applicator on one side allows me to use it for eye makeup. Really convenient to switch between both ends during the blending process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the texture of the material the sponge is made of. I am thinking of getting an extra one to carry with me, as it is good to have for blotting purposes during the day: to refresh facial makeup and look and feel great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company has provided me with a set of makeup blender sponges to test in the convenience of my home and voice my opinion.</li>
    <li> I was really surprised about these makeup sponges! I can never get myself to buy the name brand one that cost $20 for one sponge. I bought some other ones before but even after I soak it with water it&#x27;s still very firm and doesn&#x27;t apply my foundation very well, the latest one I&#x27;ve been using was tearing apart. This sponge is so soft! It already feels different than the ones I used before and it apply my foundation very smoothly! The nice tear drop shape helps me get into smaller areas like around my nose or eyes. Affordable price and it comes with 2!</li>
