      <li>VERY good Value!</li>
      <li>Great price!</li>
      <li>THE TOOTHBRUSH REPLACEMENT HEADS ARE PERFECT.</li>
      <li>but I have been getting great check-ups at the dentist since using!</li>
      <li>Best deal on them any where I could find.</li>
      <li>My dentist is impressed with the condition of my teeth!  </li>
      <li>These brushes and the power toothbrush as the best.</li>
      <li>In fact, just returned from the dentist -- she said, gorgeous, just gorgeous.</li>
      <li>good deal keeps my 20yr.</li>
      <li>These were exactly what I was looking for and at a great price too!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this system for many years.  </li>
      <li>I love the functionality and design of this product.</li>
      <li>but why should I have to pay shipping for something that I should be able to find in just about any drugstore.  </li>
      <li>I used to be able to find replacement heads in the drugstores or the stores that sold the orignal units.  </li>
      <li>My teeth &amp; gums are healthy as can be.</li>
      <li>However, at the time I purchased these brush heads I still was using Conair and I bought them for their value and because it had become more and more diffricult to find replacement brush heads in a retail store.  </li>
      <li>Needing more brush heads for my Interpalk, I found these on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Lowest price I have been able to find, too.</li>
      <li>Many years ago I purchased a Conair electric tooth brush.  </li>
      <li>The heads work just fine and keep my teeth in wonderful shape despite their age (over 70 last time I counted).</li>
      <li>It has worked fine for almost two decades.  </li>
      <li>Fine.  </li>
      <li>The brush heads work fine.</li>
      <li>Conair Interplak Replacement Heads Bonus Pack claims that \\&quot;Brush heads fit all twist-on ConairInterplak electric toothbrushes (except model NT8)\\&quot;</li>
      <li>The information was that the replacement  brushes fit all Interplak models except the listed ones.  </li>
      <li>The write up says that it will fit all Conair Interplak bruches except for the push-on models.</li>
      <li>You should have warned your customers that these heads are for model that was available in 1990s and not lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>As someone else pointed out, this doesn&#x27;t fit all twist on models.</li>
      <li>These heads/brushes are meant to fit the TWIST-ON interplak models.</li>
      <li>Basically I found that these heads broke rather quickly.  </li>
      <li>Use very little toothpaste or none at all - toothpaste mostly makes you feel good.</li>
      <li>I have tried other brands of these power brushes and can&#x27;t find any that make my mouth feel as good.</li>
      <li>I much prefer the mini-brush - the one with 6 bristle heads on it - to the full size one.  </li>
      <li>Personally - I have never used anythning besides good old Baking Soda for cleaning my teeth with the Interplak.  </li>
      <li>The old heads that we have still work fine.  </li>
      <li>The right ones have been out of stock forever, but they&#x27;ll sell you a whole new toothbrush - for which there are no replacement brushes available.....</li>
      <li>For those who say performance is not so hot, try changing the battery in your toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Make sure you only use gel toothpaste with this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written about anything - it&#x27;s just that aggravating.</li>
      <li>I am hooked on the Interplak Electric toothbrush system, ever since it first came out a million years ago.  </li>
      <li>Thus far, the heads are always available on-line -- and I will regret the day that they ever disappear.  </li>
      <li>So I would recommend this product if you are still using the Conair electric toothbrush as they are a direct fit and color coded as well.  </li>
      <li>And in fact, to my memory, the same package of replacement brush heads I used to be able to find in stores.</li>
      <li>I can do a better job and wish to heck that they&#x27;d sell a Replacement Heads Pack of ONLY the mini-heads.  </li>
      <li>Not as good as the round Braun brushes, or the Sonicare system.</li>
      <li>The Interplak model which works with these heads is far superiour to most of the \\&quot;new and</li>
      <li>I did, however, choose to buy a second pack because this seller has such a good price, and I am hoping to find that maybe my first pack was just defective and that the second pack will be fine.  </li>
      <li>Nice package of 2 big and 1 smaller brush.</li>
      <li>My dentist advised what I got were out of date brushes for older Interplak models.</li>
      <li>have a new place to buy them, woitjout runnuing around to stores.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps the first set I ordered was just defective--I will have to see after I open the new set.  </li>
      <li>Amazon will accept back and said it will pay for sending them back, as well as refunding the original shipping cost.</li>
      <li>If I find that this second pack is the same as the first, I will not buy from this seller again, as he must be selling heads that are known to be defective (perhaps that is why he can sell them so much cheaper than everyone else).  </li>
      <li>old Elc.. brush going.</li>
      <li>Now, they are nowhere in my area and if it weren&#x27;t for Amazon carrying them, I would have to resort to the old fashioned do-it-yourself brushes.  </li>
      <li>I will then write another, more harsh review!!</li>
      <li>I live in New Jersey relatively close to NYC</li>
      <li>I have had this toothbrush for nearly 2 years with no other</li>
      <li>my title says, I love the toothbrush that fits these replacement brushes but I&#x27;m seriously thinking about not buying a new one after my current one goes.  </li>
      <li>Old technology and don&#x27;t last the recommended 3 months between brush changes...they seize and cannot be repaired.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Regardless, if you have an old Interplak model like mine, the toothbrushes last for ever if cared for.</li>
      <li>I was disappointed to see this happen more than once, and so quickly.  </li>
      <li>These replacement heads were recommended to go with a certain Interplak toothbrush I was buying, but did not fit with the toothbrush ordered.  </li>

<li> I was disappointed to see this happen more than once, and so quickly.  </li>
<li> These replacement heads were recommended to go with a certain Interplak toothbrush I was buying, but did not fit with the toothbrush ordered.  </li>
<li> I discovered in each broken head, that a teeny piece of metal had become lodged in the hole at the tip of the head, meaning it came dislodged from its original (functional) location inside.  </li>
<li> but it is so frustrating, and getting more so, to find replacement heads that it&#x27;s simply not worth it.</li>
<li> (Note, however, that there are two versions of the battery for this same model of toothbrush and one is physically \\&quot;wired on\\&quot; while the other is easily removed.)All in all, it really is too bad that this model of electric toothbrush is being phased out.</li>
<li> The replacement heads last for a very long period of time.</li>
<li> IMO, the key is using the brush until near dead then charging for a day.</li>
<li> I wonder why are you selling old parts that do not fit?</li>
<li> I have used the toothbrush for several years - I had 2 or 3 other ones before.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s getting hard to find brushes for the older style Interplak Tooth brushes.  </li>
<li> No stars beyond that, because what use is a brush head that works only half the time?</li>
<li> Even rechargable batteries don&#x27;t last forever, and when they are old, the brush heads perform poorly.</li>
<li> They would slow down or stop completely.  </li>
<li> The replacement heads for my Conair electric toothbrush that I bought on Amazon were not only expensive (30 dollars per a pack of 3) but also were old and obsolete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> but this is not true.</li>
<li> Not true, I have a NT7 model and these brushes do not fit.  </li>
<li> So, one star, because it fit perfectly on on my base.  </li>
<li> do not fit my Conair toothbrush because they were made for a model that  was discontinued 10 years ago or</li>
<li> When I got the brushes they did not fit.  </li>
<li> These do NOT fit NT7CS brushes.</li>
<li> It was as if the motor in the base couldn&#x27;t power the new brushes properly.  </li>
<li> in fact, they were a different model and so were useless.</li>
<li> Have been using these Interplak Repalcement Tooth Brush Heads for years, but they are hard to find.</li>
<li> My toothbrush model is no longer made, which means the brushes are so darn hard to find.[...</li>
<li> It is hard for me to review this product as I no longer have my Conair electric toothbrush and now use Sonic.  </li>
<li> I proptly ordered them, and noce we received them, my wife found that they worked quite poorly.  </li>
<li> Very annoying!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The package was water stained.  I would not be so picky but these are toothbrush heads.</li>
    <li> These heads/brushes are meant to fit the TWIST-ON interplak models. My toothbrush model is no longer made, which means the brushes are so darn hard to find.[...].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, if you have an old Interplak model like mine, the toothbrushes last for ever if cared for. IMO, the key is using the brush until near dead then charging for a day. After 15 years, I have had not problems whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes last longest if you use gel (not paste) toothpaste without additives (tartar, whitener, etc.). I can get my brushes to last 90-120 days this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I brush &amp; floss once daily. My teeth &amp; gums are healthy as can be. In fact, just returned from the dentist -- she said, gorgeous, just gorgeous. No one would have ever said that about my teeth &amp; gums 15 years ago.</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt;As my title says, I love the toothbrush that fits these replacement brushes but I&#x27;m seriously thinking about not buying a new one after my current one goes.  I&#x27;ve used this system  since 1995 but it is so frustrating, and getting more so, to find replacement heads that it&#x27;s simply not worth it. I know I can get them from conair but why should I have to pay shipping for something that I should be able to find in just about any drugstore.  I live in New Jersey relatively close to NYC, you think it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem - but it is.  This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written about anything - it&#x27;s just that aggravating.</li>
    <li> As someone else pointed out, this doesn&#x27;t fit all twist on models. But mine is a DPI6. And while I could return it, the postage was on me. The right ones have been out of stock forever, but they&#x27;ll sell you a whole new toothbrush - for which there are no replacement brushes available.....</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get it.  Interplak documentation recommends that you use the fullsize heads, yet the only packaging I have seen sold for replacements contains two fullsize and one compact.  I spend a lot of money for these replacements and end up throwing out the compact head.  They call it a &amp;quot;bonus&amp;quot; pack but it&#x27;s no bonus to me.</li>
    <li> Fine.  I&#x27;ve been using this system for many years.  I have no plack.</li>
    <li> The information was that the replacement  brushes fit all Interplak models except the listed ones.  Mine was not on that list so I ordered.  When I got the brushes they did not fit.  Since I has opened the package I cannot return them.  My dentist advised what I got were out of date brushes for older Interplak models.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s getting hard to find brushes for the older style Interplak Tooth brushes.  These were exactly what I was looking for and at a great price too!</li>
    <li> Nice package of 2 big and 1 smaller brush. Great price! We like the interplak toothbrush dental products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00005A44M Conair Interplak Replacement Heads Bonus Pack]]</li>
    <li> Many years ago I purchased a Conair electric tooth brush.  It has worked fine for almost two decades.  Only the heads need replacement from time to time.  Thus far, the heads are always available on-line -- and I will regret the day that they ever disappear.  The heads work just fine and keep my teeth in wonderful shape despite their age (over 70 last time I counted).</li>
    <li> Make sure you only use gel toothpaste with this toothbrush. The paste toothpaste will cause the heads to sieze up.&lt;BR&gt;I have had this toothbrush for nearly 2 years with no other problems.&lt;br /&gt;... but I have been getting great check-ups at the dentist since using!</li>
    <li> I am not actually writing this review based on the set of replacement heads that I just ordered, but on the last set of heads that I ordered from the same seller.  Perhaps the first set I ordered was just defective--I will have to see after I open the new set.  Basically I found that these heads broke rather quickly.  Actually the heads should not break at all...you should just have to replace them when the bristles get worn.  I found that after about a month, the bristles would quit rotating, though the motor in the actual handle part of the brush was still running.  I discovered in each broken head, that a teeny piece of metal had become lodged in the hole at the tip of the head, meaning it came dislodged from its original (functional) location inside.  I must assume this is the cause for the bristles no longer rotating.  I was disappointed to see this happen more than once, and so quickly.  I did, however, choose to buy a second pack because this seller has such a good price, and I am hoping to find that maybe my first pack was just defective and that the second pack will be fine.  If I find that this second pack is the same as the first, I will not buy from this seller again, as he must be selling heads that are known to be defective (perhaps that is why he can sell them so much cheaper than everyone else).  I will then write another, more harsh review!!</li>
    <li> Conair Interplak Replacement Heads Bonus Pack claims that \\&quot;Brush heads fit all twist-on ConairInterplak electric toothbrushes (except model NT8)\\&quot; but this is not true. These do NOT fit NT7CS brushes. The Brush head that fits NT7CS is # 12167. I alerted Amazon about this error on November 8, 2010, but I do not see that they have made the correction on their website.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Interplak for probably 15 years now.  My dentist told me &amp;quot;if you want to keep your teeth for another 10 years you&#x27;ve gotta start using this&amp;quot; and he told me all about it.  I bought one on the way home and been using it every since.  I think this is the 3rd Interplak I&#x27;ve owned.  I much prefer the mini-brush - the one with 6 bristle heads on it - to the full size one.  I can do a better job and wish to heck that they&#x27;d sell a Replacement Heads Pack of ONLY the mini-heads.  Course, as one reviewer said - you can only use Gel Toothpaste with this brush.  Personally - I have never used anythning besides good old Baking Soda for cleaning my teeth with the Interplak.  My dentist is impressed with the condition of my teeth!  Brushing with the Interplak and flossing religiously has made all of the difference for me!</li>
    <li> Have been using these Interplak Repalcement Tooth Brush Heads for years, but they are hard to find. I like &amp; trust Amazon, so &lt;br /&gt;I have a new place to buy them, woitjout runnuing around to stores.  &lt;br /&gt;Thansk you Amazon.com</li>
    <li> These replacement heads were recommended to go with a certain Interplak toothbrush I was buying, but did not fit with the toothbrush ordered.  Very annoying!  I had to return the heads, but also returned the toothbrush because it had practically no cleaning power!  Go with Oral B.</li>
    <li> Best deal on them any where I could find. Will get them here from now on.</li>
    <li> The brush heads work fine. For those who say performance is not so hot, try changing the battery in your toothbrush. Even rechargable batteries don&#x27;t last forever, and when they are old, the brush heads perform poorly. (Note, however, that there are two versions of the battery for this same model of toothbrush and one is physically \\&quot;wired on\\&quot; while the other is easily removed.)All in all, it really is too bad that this model of electric toothbrush is being phased out. The Interplak model which works with these heads is far superiour to most of the \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; models coming on to the market.</li>
    <li> It is hard for me to review this product as I no longer have my Conair electric toothbrush and now use Sonic.  However, at the time I purchased these brush heads I still was using Conair and I bought them for their value and because it had become more and more diffricult to find replacement brush heads in a retail store.  Simply put, the stores were no longer stocking this item.  So I would recommend this product if you are still using the Conair electric toothbrush as they are a direct fit and color coded as well.  And in fact, to my memory, the same package of replacement brush heads I used to be able to find in stores.</li>
    <li> Needing more brush heads for my Interpalk, I found these on Amazon.  I proptly ordered them, and noce we received them, my wife found that they worked quite poorly.  It was as if the motor in the base couldn&#x27;t power the new brushes properly.  They would slow down or stop completely.  The old heads that we have still work fine.  We just thought we&#x27;d get some extras.  Hope I can send these back for a refund.  Another reviewer seemed to have the same problem. So, one star, because it fit perfectly on on my base.  No stars beyond that, because what use is a brush head that works only half the time?</li>
    <li> Not as good as the round Braun brushes, or the Sonicare system.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00005A44M Conair Interplak Replacement Heads Bonus Pack]]    The write up says that it will fit all Conair Interplak bruches except for the push-on models.

    <li> I wonder why are you selling old parts that do not fit? You should have warned your customers that these heads are for model that was available in 1990s and not lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I was cheated.</li>
    <li> they are not for the interplack electric tooth brush that we purchased....re-ordered the correct ones</li>
    <li> I am hooked on the Interplak Electric toothbrush system, ever since it first came out a million years ago.  I used to be able to find replacement heads in the drugstores or the stores that sold the orignal units.  Now, they are nowhere in my area and if it weren&#x27;t for Amazon carrying them, I would have to resort to the old fashioned do-it-yourself brushes.  I have tried other brands of these power brushes and can&#x27;t find any that make my mouth feel as good.</li>
    <li> These were shown in the Amazon catalog and looked like the NT7,  &lt;br /&gt;but in fact, they were a different model and so were useless.</li>
    <li> good deal keeps my 20yr. old Elc.. brush going.</li>
    <li> Old technology and don&#x27;t last the recommended 3 months between brush changes...they seize and cannot be repaired.</li>
    <li> I have used the toothbrush for several years - I had 2 or 3 other ones before. These brushes and the power toothbrush as the best. Use very little toothpaste or none at all - toothpaste mostly makes you feel good. Lowest price I have been able to find, too.</li>
    <li> THE TOOTHBRUSH REPLACEMENT HEADS ARE PERFECT. &lt;br /&gt;USE TO FIND IN STORE ABOUT ONE YEAR AGO, &lt;br /&gt;BUT COMPANY NO LONGER MAKES. &lt;br /&gt;JOHNNY</li>
    <li> I love the functionality and design of this product. The replacement heads last for a very long period of time. VERY good Value!</li>
    <li> The replacement heads for my Conair electric toothbrush that I bought on Amazon were not only expensive (30 dollars per a pack of 3) but also were old and obsolete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do not fit my Conair toothbrush because they were made for a model that  was discontinued 10 years ago or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could return them for a refund.</li>
