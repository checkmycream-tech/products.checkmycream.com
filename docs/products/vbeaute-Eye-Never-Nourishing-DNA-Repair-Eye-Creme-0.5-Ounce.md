### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It is probably the best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>ago.&lt;br /&gt;I was really impressed; the sample was generous and&lt;br /&gt;lasted</li>
      <li>I am always on the search for the perfect eye cream...</li>

      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say this is the best eye cream, but it is quite good.</li>
      <li>We haven&#x27;t experienced any tearing or burning, but we also did not slather it on our eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But since it smells and feels so nice, I&#x27;m happy to keep on using it!</li>
      <li>but I imagine the effects will be great.</li>
      <li>/&gt;V-beaute is a very nice product, and I&#x27;d recommend it to those who spend this amount already on their skin creams.</li>

      <li>packaging is very interesting and attractive.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for a month, morning and night, it feels good going on and didn&#x27;t interfere with my foundation.</li>
      <li>and you shouldn&#x27;t apply it at night if you need a good night sleep.</li>
      <li>It feels marvelous going on, soothing and cool against my skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very glad that my skin likes Eye</li>
      <li>The purple color is attractive and the design is appealing.  </li>
      <li>The packaging is also stylish, making this product a great gift.</li>
      <li>So just make sure to apply as directed.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product for sure!</li>
      <li>Of course, with its list of interesting ingredients (caffeine...and so on!), I would like to think that the eye cream is effective in preventing wrinkles</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye never has its pros, but after I use this jar up, I do believe Eye Never will own another!&lt;br</li>
      <li>the kind you buy for your children to blow in the summertime.</li>
      <li>and sometimes I would get kind of a crusty residue where I&#x27;d applied it.</li>
      <li>It also leaves kind of a shine where you apply it...</li>
      <li>has a nice neutral scent</li>
      <li>the kind you buy for your children to blow in the summertime.</li>
      <li>the creme effective?</li>
      <li>Honestly, my eye area looks like that of a&lt;br /&gt;16-year old - perfect - no lines, no dryness, no puffiness, no&lt;br</li>
      <li>While the packaging is attractive and it feels nice going on, I have not seen any changes or positive difference to warrant the cost of this.</li>
      <li>I notice the beginning of very fine lines on days</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using vbeaute for about two weeks now, and while I don&#x27;t notice any specific changes, it sure smells good - and it feels good going on!</li>
      <li>love that it&#x27;s got a very smooth and silky texture, but not so slippery that your eye make-up doesn&#x27;t stay</li>
      <li>/&gt;And as I&#x27;m reviewing my selections ### I came across a lovely picture of the jar of vbeaute#</li>
      <li>but it is 12.00 more in price.  </li>
      <li>My problem is baggy eyes from years of not sleeping more than 4 or 5 hours a night.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Personally, I hadn&#x27;t noticed she even had any wrinkles. :)</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s even more disappointing!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think this is one of those products that is more preventative than restorative.</li>
      <li>and I need more patience.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Oh, I so wanted to love this cream.</li>
      <li>Most of the eye</li>
      <li>It is a much better cr&amp;egrave;me that I ever would have guessed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so maybe the cream needs more time</li>
      <li>if it isn&#x27;t diminishing my wrinkles, I love it.</li>
      <li>If I can come up with the cash, I plan to buy more when I finish this</li>
      <li>DNA Repair Eye Cr&amp;egrave;me It Kit Refill, 0.27 Fl  Ounce]]es between my eyes, and my skin around my eyes looks better -</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s even more disappointing!&lt;br</li>
      <li>It goes on nice a smooth..</li>
      <li>, I was pleased.  </li>
      <li>that&#x27;s even more disappointing!&lt;br</li>
      <li>&quot; I would love to recommend this product</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t believe most claims of amazing results, so, I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
      <li>Upon first inspection, I thought the triangular jar was unique and attractive.</li>
      <li>- a large bottle - good thing it was free!</li>
      <li>- a large bottle - good thing it was free!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other night-creams and the consistency and texture of this is perfect to me.</li>
      <li>It is not greasy at all, and is easy to apply makeup over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
      <li>it help with wrinkles and fine lines, though?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m newly 32 with fair, lightly freckled skin.</li>
      <li>The crème is supposed to conceal lines, smooth and silken skin, minimize the appearance of puffiness, and correct lines and wrinkles, according to the product website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;\\&quot;I received this eye cream free to review, and although it did leave my eyes feeling smoother and softer, I did not notice any reduction in wrinkles.</li>
      <li>It felt silky and smooth going on</li>
      <li>The creme&#x27;s ingredients are listed on this product page under the heading \\&quot;Important Information.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I quite enjoy it.</li>
      <li>I have ever used are as light as air.  </li>
      <li>I had my husband get out our jewelers loop which has a light source and asked him to pass judgement.  </li>
      <li>do notice it&#x27;s great for make-up application and does not cause puffiness like some creams can the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>So if you too have sensitive skin this product may be a good choice for you.</li>
      <li>Frankly, I&#x27;ve never understood why the skin around my eyes requires special formulations that, say, my cheeks don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>The product I use most often, which comes closest is Patricia Wexler, but it really didn&#x27;t get rid of any lines at all, just kept my skin in somewhat of a holding pattern - soft and touchable, but I knew I needed something better!</li>

      <li>This cream comes in a lovely, unusually shaped jar.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this vbeaute brand as my \\&quot;yes to carrots\\&quot; eye cream for about $10 does a much nicer, more affordable job.</li>
      <li>It was the BEST eye cream I&#x27;ve tried in the short term, but the results didn&#x27;t seem to last...</li>
      <li>Since your eyes are where everyone gazes, keeping your peepers pretty is incredibly important.</li>
      <li>The price is higher than what I&#x27;d like to pay, with 2 kids in college, and others who still expect to go!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried Anthony Logistics for Men products for the under-eye area and have been happy with them, but I&#x27;m always open to new products.</li>
      <li>I was very excited about trying this new product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed recently more fine lines popping up, especially when I smile.</li>
      <li>I liked the jar, I liked the thick consistency of it</li>
      <li>My eye area still crinkles up and looks wrinkly when I smile.  </li>
      <li>lower it to 3 stars, but the product is still worth 4 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
      <li>question is, being that I received Eye Never as a complimentary trial...</li>
      <li>While this cream didn&#x27;t work any miracles for me, it works fine if you&#x27;re looking for a decent moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>What better package for the rich cream than inside the deep purple-colored package with silver cap, which I assume its shape was intended to resemble a \\&quot;V\\&quot;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>have to admit, after trying SO many eye creams, and pretty much giving up hope that any would ever really deliver,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Never, and if it were free, like my Patricia Wexler, it would be my new brand, but because I get a high end product free</li>
      <li>Never, and if it were free, like my Patricia Wexler, it would be my new brand, but because I get a high end product free</li>
      <li>and it is very gentle on my eyes.  </li>
      <li>With that said, I can honestly see a decrease in my eye puffiness but no real decrease in my crows feet or lines under the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Never\\&quot; on the jar, the jar is a pretty shiny purple, and is shaped like a rounded triangle.  </li>
      <li>But the lid is triangular-shaped and when I first opened it, the product spilled out over the edges.  </li>
      <li>(There are many reviews that have had irritation so your experience may be different than mine)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;I will continue to use this product cautiously, because I&#x27;d love to see some lasting results.</li>
      <li>It bothered me at first but not for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have tried this product for several days and my reaction is definitely mixed.  On the one hand, I did notice an immediate softening/reduction in lines around my eyes and less puffiness.  The product did not irritate my sensitive skin or cause any redness.  On the other hand, each night I used it (and I was careful to use a light touch and focus on the orbital bone area and not get close to my eyes) I woke up with burning in my eyes as well as an excess of tearing.  I looked at the ingredient list-- which is intimidating to say the least-- over 50 ingredients and most are chemicals I can&#x27;t pronounce.  The first ingredient is water, which at least is easily understood. The second ingredient turns out to be a common cosmetic chemical thickener. However, the 4th ingredient, butylene glycol, is a known irritant which can cause eye and skin irritation.  Wouldn&#x27;t common sense say not to put this in an eye product? At that point, I quit looking up the chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an equally mixed reaction to the very attractive, but awkward container.  The purple color is attractive and the design is appealing.  But the lid is triangular-shaped and when I first opened it, the product spilled out over the edges.  Now this is some valuable product, so I really didn&#x27;t want to waste it by tissue-ing it away.  So I tried to carefully put it back in the jar, which, as I&#x27;m sure you can guess, made it even messier.  Oh well. For the moment I think I&#x27;ll stick with Olay products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using vbeaute for about two weeks now, and while I don&#x27;t notice any specific changes, it sure smells good - and it feels good going on! I think this is one of those products that is more preventative than restorative. But since it smells and feels so nice, I&#x27;m happy to keep on using it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream fairly regularly for the last 4 weeks. (I adore the name, Eye Never. So clever!) It goes on like silk, blending well into my skin. It is not greasy at all, and is easy to apply makeup over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it help with wrinkles and fine lines, though? Hmmm...not so far. Maybe 4 weeks isn&#x27;t enough time to see results? I will keep using it, and post an update if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if it isn&#x27;t diminishing my wrinkles, I love it. It feels marvelous going on, soothing and cool against my skin. A little goes an awfully long way, too, so the product should last several months, even with regular use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about six weeks and am very impressed with it. Do I believe it repairs DNA--heck no! I don&#x27;t think a topical cream can reach into your skin and repair your DNA. Do I believe it prevents wrinkles? No. Do I believe it increases eye collagen production. Heck no. I don&#x27;t believe any topical product can repair and aid your DNA or increase your collagen production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why did I give this five stars when I discount some of the product&#x27;s claims?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple. It is probably the best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used. A very small dab goes on smoothly and moisturizes all day. My skin in the winter tends to be dry. Dry enough that I often put straight Jojoba oil on my face as a moisturizer. Using this cream I have had no need to use the oil under my eyes (which makes the mascara and eyeliner melt. Some reviewers have complained about eye irritation so I have been careful not to get it right under the eyes--leaving about an eighth to a fourth of an inch gap. The product has helped with puffy eyes. After a night of little sleep I can smooth on the eye cream and the puffiness goes down. Feels a lot more elegant than putting cold cucumbers on your eyes or wet tea bags to get rid of that puffy look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cosmetics are a very personal choice. It doesn&#x27;t matter how cheap or how expensive a cosmetic item is or what their claims are--different skin types are going to react differently. I&#x27;m very glad that my skin likes Eye Never Nourishing DNA Repair Eye Cr&amp;egrave;me!</li>
    <li> I had received a sample of this eye cream about 2-years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I was really impressed; the sample was generous and&lt;br /&gt;lasted me almost two weeks.  This cream does what it says&lt;br /&gt;it does.  I had a few very fine lines around my eye area and&lt;br /&gt;dryness is my main concern.  This cream made my entire eye&lt;br /&gt;area look refreshed, moisturized, and the lines disappeared&lt;br /&gt;within a couple weeks.  I began to buy it regularly and still&lt;br /&gt;continued to try various samples of other eye creams.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing compares to this.  The real plus is that this does not&lt;br /&gt;irritate my eyes in any way (and I have extremely sensitive skin).&lt;br /&gt;The jar lasts a long time because you need only a very tiny&lt;br /&gt;amount,  I use it at night only.  I tap it on the entire orbital bone&lt;br /&gt;and upper cheekbone as well as a wee bit on my eyelids and&lt;br /&gt;between my eyes.  Honestly, my eye area looks like that of a&lt;br /&gt;16-year old - perfect - no lines, no dryness, no puffiness, no&lt;br /&gt;dark circles.  With regular use it looks as though you&#x27;ve had an&lt;br /&gt;eye lift.  I don&#x27;t even need to use concealer.  It&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this and it&#x27;s moderately priced.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, by the way, I just turned 63 years old.  Life is good!</li>
    <li> I chose to review the vbeaute Nourishing DNA Repair Eye Cream, in a .5 ounce container.&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, after trying SO many eye creams, and pretty much giving up hope that any would ever really deliver,&lt;br /&gt;I was cautiously happy with the initial results of this little purple jar I received from Amazon Vine! It was the BEST eye cream I&#x27;ve tried in the short term, but the results didn&#x27;t seem to last...I didn&#x27;t find the \\&quot;repair\\&quot; to be literal. Which I didn&#x27;t expect from a topical cream, but I can hope!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;V-beaute is a very nice product, and I&#x27;d recommend it to those who spend this amount already on their skin creams. It is a very good product.&lt;br /&gt;Since reviewing this product they&#x27;ve changed the pkging. This is a MUCH smaller amount, in a tube instead of a jar, but the price doesn&#x27;t reflect the change. The jar was $45, but the tube is still $38 - that&#x27;s even more disappointing!&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0060HOQYS vbeaut&amp;eacute; Eye Never Nourishing DNA Repair Eye Cr&amp;egrave;me It Kit Refill, 0.27 Fl  Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d lower it to 3 stars, but the product is still worth 4 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years I&#x27;ve developed nasty little habits - like squinting from the sun, or because I can&#x27;t see as well as I should (given that expensive eye surgery! eh hem...but I digress...) I rubbed cream after cream - all the ones promising to rid me of my \\&quot;fine lines and wrinkles\\&quot;, and even those that promised to rid me of my \\&quot;deep lines and wrinkles\\&quot;! What the heck! I&#x27;m not THAT old ### well I guess it depends on what side of 50 you sit, and if you believe that 50 is the new 40, and 40 the new 30 and all of that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as I&#x27;m reviewing my selections ### I came across a lovely picture of the jar of vbeaute# I don&#x27;t know about the na#e &#x3D; vbeaute, but the purple jar with silver lid is very pretty - looks upscale with a simple V on the jar# The price is higher than what I&#x27;d like to pay, with 2 kids in college, and others who still expect to go!  In the short term it did get RID of the lines between my eyes, and my skin around my eyes looks better - I love the smoothness and very faint bubbly smell of the cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the cream &#x3D; in color it is pure white - the color of cold cream, and has the faintest smell...almost of bubbles - you know... the kind you buy for your children to blow in the summertime. At first it feels cold, and rubs in well, with just a hint of stickiness, but then it settles and your skin feels like satin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I should tell what some of the other products are that I&#x27;ve been using which haven&#x27;t measured up... The product I use most often, which comes closest is Patricia Wexler, but it really didn&#x27;t get rid of any lines at all, just kept my skin in somewhat of a holding pattern - soft and touchable, but I knew I needed something better! I&#x27;ve used Kinerase - felt like Elmer&#x27;s glue, smelled like it and didn&#x27;t do a thing for my skin - a large bottle - good thing it was free! At the less expensive end I&#x27;ve also used Garnier and Aveeno. I&#x27;ve also tried Olay Regenerist and it&#x27;s pretty much right in the middle. Then I received the V Eye Never, and if it were free, like my Patricia Wexler, it would be my new brand, but because I get a high end product free I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;V-beaute is a very nice product, and I&#x27;d recommend it to those who spend this amount already on their skin creams.

    <li> This cream comes in a lovely, unusually shaped jar. I do not know if the contents inside, work.&lt;br /&gt;The jar&#x27;s lid doesn&#x27;t, not easily.&lt;br /&gt;I have been following the instructions religiously, applying the cream night and day. Sometimes I think it is working and the dark circles have diminished and other times I think it&#x27;s just a placebo effect. But it&#x27;s been only a week so maybe the cream needs more time and I need more patience.&lt;br /&gt;I promise if I notice a change, I&#x27;ll be back and give you an update.&lt;br /&gt;The cream is odorless and soothing. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and I do have to say I can see a slight difference in the way my eyes look. The cream is light/not too heavy and it feels smooth going on. I don&#x27;t feel uncomfortable sleeping with it on my face. I gave it 4 stars because I have used other products that made a more visual difference to my eyes. I wouldn&#x27;t say this is the best eye cream, but it is quite good.</li>
    <li> My wife says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I received this eye cream free to review, and although it did leave my eyes feeling smoother and softer, I did not notice any reduction in wrinkles. I actually ended up using it as an all over facial moisturizer, because it did have a nice feel to it. But, but am not sure I would buy it again, due to the $45 price tag.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I hadn&#x27;t noticed she even had any wrinkles. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the vbeaute Eye Never Nourishing DNA creme for about a month. I&#x27;m newly 32 with fair, lightly freckled skin. I&#x27;ve noticed recently more fine lines popping up, especially when I smile. I apply eye creme in the morning and in the evening before bed. While the packaging is attractive and it feels nice going on, I have not seen any changes or positive difference to warrant the cost of this.I did get it too close to my eye one night and had lots of tearing and irritation, learned my lesson there!! I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this vbeaute brand as my \\&quot;yes to carrots\\&quot; eye cream for about $10 does a much nicer, more affordable job.</li>
    <li> Eye Never Nourishing Repair Eye Crème, by vbeaute, is supposed to be like \\&quot;an eyelift in a jar.\\&quot;  The crème is supposed to conceal lines, smooth and silken skin, minimize the appearance of puffiness, and correct lines and wrinkles, according to the product website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the product for three weeks now, twice daily, and I can&#x27;t say I see any difference in my skin.  My eye area still crinkles up and looks wrinkly when I smile.  There&#x27;s been no \\&quot;instant\\&quot; reduction in puffiness upon application.  It hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin, though my eye area has been dry a few mornings so I have questioned how much it was moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even at Amazon&#x27;s price (which is much less than what it sells for at vbeaute&#x27;s website ), I must say that the product is way overpriced for what it delivers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only 24, but I seem to be genetically programmed to have dark circles under my eyes. I&#x27;ve also started to pick up vague lines under my eyes. It&#x27;s not so bad that I wanted to spend a lot of money to fix it, but when I got offered this eye cream, I thought, why not? But like a Charmander using an ember attack against a Squirtle, it&#x27;s not very effective. Not that I could tell, anyway. I applied it day and night for several days and didn&#x27;t notice any difference. Didn&#x27;t irritate the skin around my eye, but it did sting my eyes when I got it in them, made them tear up. It also leaves kind of a shine where you apply it... and sometimes I would get kind of a crusty residue where I&#x27;d applied it. Not sure if that was the dried cream or dead skin... but that&#x27;s not something I usually have. Glad I got this through Vine and didn&#x27;t actually buy it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how others on here have not seen immediate changes when using this eye cream. It smoothed out any puffiness and wrinkles. It did make the area I applied it on tingle. I assume it&#x27;s the caffeine. I can&#x27;t speak to the effects of using it for a prolonged period of time but I imagine the effects will be great.</li>
    <li> This product works, however keep in mind that it has caffeine and you shouldn&#x27;t apply it at night if you need a good night sleep. Once applied, the product yields a cool and tingly sensation with results visible almost instantly. Skin responds to caffeine and the ingredients used in this cr&amp;egrave;me, so you can expect positive results within a relatively short time frame. The packaging is also stylish, making this product a great gift. The only negative side is the cost, but then aain who said beauty should come cheap?</li>
    <li> I experimented with this eye creme for about a week. I wanted to be sure my skin wouldn&#x27;t have a bad reaction to it (it didn&#x27;t), and also to see if it produced a noticeable difference around my eyes. I started with just a little of the creme on the crow&#x27;s feet beside my left eye. Shortly thereafter, I noticed some stinging in my left eye. It wasn&#x27;t too bad, because I had only used a tiny bit of creme, but it made me cautious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the week progressed, I continued to experiment on different spots around my eyes, one side at a time so I could compare. What I found is that you have to do EXACTLY as the instructions say if you want to avoid the stinging in your eyes. The instructions say to pat the creme on the orbital bone. This means ON the orbital bone, and no closer to the eye than the edge of that bone. This is why I say they should include an explicit warning, and maybe take the formula back to the laboratory for some fine-tuning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the creme effective? I don&#x27;t know about long-term, but it does provide very noticeable temporary improvement. When I put it around one eye and not the other, the difference is easy to see. The skin around the eye without the creme looks flat and haggard and wrinkly. The skin around the eye with the creme is plumped out, and the wrinkles are less noticeable. I haven&#x27;t timed it to see exactly how long the effect lasts, but it&#x27;s only a few hours at most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The creme does increase blood flow to the area, which I understand improves collagen production. So maybe with long-term use you&#x27;ll see some permanent improvement. The creme also contains antioxidant ingredients, which could slow further damage to your skin from environmental factors. The creme&#x27;s ingredients are listed on this product page under the heading \\&quot;Important Information.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product cautiously, because I&#x27;d love to see some lasting results. It will probably take a long time for me to see those results, because I won&#x27;t use the creme at night. I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;d rub my eyes in my sleep and wake up to burning eyeballs.won&#x27;t use the creme at night. I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;d rub my eyes in my sleep and wake up to burning eyeballs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my late-mid (mid-late?) forties and I&#x27;m developing some Tommy Lee Jones-worthy bags under my eyes. I&#x27;ve tried Anthony Logistics for Men products for the under-eye area and have been happy with them, but I&#x27;m always open to new products. After using the Eye Never Creme daily for about six weeks, I have to admit that I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference. Frankly, I&#x27;ve never understood why the skin around my eyes requires special formulations that, say, my cheeks don&#x27;t. That said, it goes on silky-smooth and leaves very little shine. I&#x27;ll keep using it and keep looking for improvement; if something noticeable happens, I&#x27;ll let you know.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m turning 26 and a bit rough on my eyes (rubbing off mascara ever single day can really abuse the sensitive skin around my eyes). Since your eyes are where everyone gazes, keeping your peepers pretty is incredibly important. I notice the beginning of very fine lines on days I&#x27;m tired or the skin around them is dry. Since the skin around your eyes is some of the thinnest and most delicate on your body, wear on it will show FAST.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product nightly for 2 weeks now and I quite enjoy it. (The directions suggest using it during the day too, and I think it&#x27;s lightweight enough to do so, but I&#x27;ll leave that to others to try.) I can definitely see an improvement the next morning after I wear it to bed, though it&#x27;s nothing magical (at least after 2 weeks). I rub a tiny amount under my eyes, on my lids, and up to my eyebrows. It is very lightweight and absorbs quickly with absolutely no eye irritation. I&#x27;ve tried other night-creams and the consistency and texture of this is perfect to me. I can&#x27;t do heavy or oily products since it can make my skin greasy or break out. This is neither.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think the product is rather pricey, however I end up using such a tiny amount that I think one jar will last me a good 4-6 months. Breaking down the cost, it&#x27;s a pretty decent price for a product I really enjoy.</li>
    <li> It goes on nice a smooth.. But I can&#x27;t tell the results yet, since I&#x27;ve one had it a couple of days!</li>
    <li> I have puffy dark circles and wrinkles under my eyes and have tried numerous products as well as home remedies.  I routinely applied vbeaute DNA Repair in the morning and evening after cleansing my face.  I used my ring finger and applied a small amount around the bone surrounding my eye socket using a counter clockwise circle movement.  It felt silky and smooth going on and it also left a tingling warming sensation that lasted less than a minute.  After three straight weeks so far the results are....no improvement what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have attached a photo showing 3 different photos.  I took a picture after each week to see if there was any change.  You be the judge.  I usually do not wear makeup, but I do have permanently tattooed eyeliner.  In the last picture I am wearing mascara.  I saw no difference from week one to week three.  :-(</li>
    <li> Ever since I broke up with Clinique, I have been using a lot of different things.  I can&#x27;t believe all of the stuff I missed.  Admittedly, I was a little suspicious of this cr&amp;egrave;me when I first saw it.  It had a clever \\&quot;Eye Never\\&quot; on the jar, the jar is a pretty shiny purple, and is shaped like a rounded triangle.  I have to admit feeling a little groan because that kind of bottle always has something with funny smells inside of it that makes my skin turn pink and bumpy.  But this was not true at all.  It is a much better cr&amp;egrave;me that I ever would have guessed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cr&amp;egrave;me is pretty thick, surprisingly so.  Most of the eye cr&amp;egrave;mes I have ever used are as light as air.  I have always been taught to put the thinnest lightest cr&amp;egrave;mes on the bottom layer and then work outward.  It bothered me at first but not for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a thick cr&amp;egrave;me that doesn&#x27;t have any perfumey smell to it.  There really isn&#x27;t any smell, which is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem that I encountered is rubbing my eyes.  For some reason, this cr&amp;egrave;me feels really sharp and burns a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem isn&#x27;t really wrinkles - before I used it, I had to squinch my eyes to make wrinkles and I still do.  My problem is baggy eyes from years of not sleeping more than 4 or 5 hours a night.  It didn&#x27;t really make any difference in that problem but my skin was and is very well moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue using this.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have known when I opened the jar that it wouldn&#x27;t turn out well. The creme has a slightly oily texture that didn&#x27;t feel moisturizing, just wet. When I applied it, it didn&#x27;t penetrate very well for awhile, it just sat on my skin, even though I used a very tiny amount and only on the outer third of my undereye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning, my eyes were irritated, watering, puffy and I had a rash on my upper cheeks that I can only guess was there from the product sliding down my face as I slept. TWO days later, I finally stopped feeling like I needed to rub something out of my eyes and the redness faded from the inside lower rims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may have fairly sensitive skin but I have never, ever had a reaction like this to a product.</li>
    <li> Those of us with thinning skin around the eyes are always looking for the next thing that will improve those crow&#x27;s feet and keep us from looking old on the outside when we aren&#x27;t so old on the inside. While this cream didn&#x27;t work any miracles for me, it works fine if you&#x27;re looking for a decent moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t believe most claims of amazing results, so, I&#x27;m not disappointed. I have used this product for a month, morning and night, it feels good going on and didn&#x27;t interfere with my foundation. Since I have very pale skin my wrinkles are fairly noticeable, and unfortunately, this cream was up to the task as far as making them go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I have very sensitive skin and Eye Never didn&#x27;t irritate it or cause any blemishes. So if you too have sensitive skin this product may be a good choice for you.</li>
    <li> vbeaut&amp;eacute; Eye Never Nourishing DNA Repair Eye Cr&amp;egrave;me, 0.5 Ounce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this eye cr&amp;egrave;me for over a week, the results speaks for itself. The cr&amp;egrave;me is thick but silky, and applies very smoothly. There&#x27;s no greasy feel and it works very well to tighten up the pockets under the eyes as well as reduces the dark spots within a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is very interesting and attractive. The triangular lid is hard to lock, and the bottle appears much larger than necessary. I let a friend try it out as well, and she also loves its results. We haven&#x27;t experienced any tearing or burning, but we also did not slather it on our eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 15 NOV 2012:&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that with the cooler and drier weather that the eye cream doesn&#x27;t keep the treated skin moisturized as long. In fact, the skin tends to dry in the areas that had the cream applied. In addition, if the cream gets into an eye while asleep (as an example), it will burn like crazy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 4/5 stars, pricey but works well but doesn&#x27;t seem to last long in dry/cold weather. Note that it will burn if some of it gets into an eye. I recommend caution when applying it and avoid applying it too close to an eye.</li>
    <li> Well, knock me over with a feather, but I got noticeable results with this Nourishing DNA Repair creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE EXPERIMENT:&lt;br /&gt;Okay, I&#x27;m a bit of a science geek so what I did was apply the creme to the area around just one eye.  I did this for two weeks.  At the end of that time I had my husband get out our jewelers loop which has a light source and asked him to pass judgement.  Because he&#x27;s a guy, he never made note of which eye was treated and I consider him to be an unbiased judge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE RESULTS:&lt;br /&gt;After studying both eye regions for an annoyingly long period of time, he announced that the left region --the one to which I had applied the creme -- had fewer fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHER OBSERVATIONS AND NOTES:&lt;br /&gt;--It was strange but the first time I applied the creme my eyes burned. After that I had no similar reaction.  It was almost as if the creme needed to air out.  (I suggest you do air it out)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--As anticipated, I noted that my skin felt dry and slightly irritated.  I say anticipated because I know that this is a common side effect of both over-the-counter and doctor-prescribed skin products which are anti-aging.  I counteracted this effect with the application of an oiless moisturizing lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--My skin is very very sensitive.  I could not, for example, use an Oil of Olay product that was similar because it irritated my face too much.  I did not have a problem using this vbeaut&amp;eacute; Eye Never Nourishing DNA Repair Eye Cr&amp;egrave;me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--I noticed that a dark area --I refuse to say &#x27;age spot&#x27;-- was lightened with the use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN GENERAL, I was pleased.  I found the creme to be mild enough for me, and I got noticeable results after only 2 weeks.  If I can come up with the cash, I plan to buy more when I finish this jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pam T~</li>
    <li> I am a total eye cream diva.  I am always on the search for the perfect eye cream... and this one didn&#x27;t disappoint!&lt;br /&gt;I love that it&#x27;s got a very smooth and silky texture, but not so slippery that your eye make-up doesn&#x27;t stay put.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for daytime and evening with success.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice neutral scent, in fact, I don&#x27;t think I even noticed a scent at all.  Which is important for me, because the wrong scent or a strong scent can give me a migraine.  Also, heavy fragrance by the eye is not good for the delicate skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about 6 weeks, and haven&#x27;t seen any drastic improvement, but then again I really don&#x27;t have wrinkles near my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I do notice it&#x27;s great for make-up application and does not cause puffiness like some creams can the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this product, is what others have mentioned.  If you get too much in your eye, it will sting and cause watering.  So just make sure to apply as directed.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product for sure!</li>
    <li> From the start, the creamy, smooth, perfectly thick consistency was the cr&amp;egrave;me de la cr&amp;egrave;me! What better package for the rich cream than inside the deep purple-colored package with silver cap, which I assume its shape was intended to resemble a \\&quot;V\\&quot;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, carrying such a hefty price tag, product appearance and package takes a way-back seat to actual results. Using it every day, I gave Eye Never a fair trial period of nearly a month. In the end, what I know, after trying at least a couple dozen different eye cream brands over the years, remains: NOTHING compares to an eye lift (as their advertisements allude to) than--you guessed it--a surgeon&#x27;s scalpel. However, I must say that although the lines around my eyes remain, they are smoother and my eyes appear less puffy and the circles around them look a tad less dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The question is, being that I received Eye Never as a complimentary trial...would I purchase a jar?  I don&#x27;t think so--not when I can get comparable results for a far lower price. Of course, with its list of interesting ingredients (caffeine...and so on!), I would like to think that the eye cream is effective in preventing wrinkles so this is one enticement to continue to keep it on my bathroom shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I had to cease my application of Eye Never during the day.  Though it did not seem greasy to the touch, the cream smeared with my mascara and caused my eyes to become irritated as the day wore on!  I have never had this happen before with other eye creams, so it was very strange, and, obviously, limited the product use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye never has its pros, but after I use this jar up, I do believe Eye Never will own another!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stacy Lytwyn, Marketing Guru/Motivational Speaker/Journalist&lt;br /&gt;Author: CONSUMMATE CONNECTICUT: DAY TRIPS WITH PANACHE</li>
    <li> Oh, I so wanted to love this cream. I liked the jar, I liked the thick consistency of it and I liked the fact that you didn&#x27;t need to apply a thick coating of it like others I have used in the past. What I didn&#x27;t like was the severe irritation it caused. I put it on before bed and it took less than 15 minutes for my eyes to redden and burn. I had to wash them out and still a nagging pain lingered. That&#x27;s just unacceptable. I followed the directions to a \\&quot;T.\\&quot; I would love to recommend this product but I just can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> 3+ stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using vbeaute eye never eye cream for about 3 weeks.  It is difficult to review a product such as this as most take at least 5-6 weeks to see any noticable differences.  With that said, I can honestly see a decrease in my eye puffiness but no real decrease in my crows feet or lines under the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very creamy and a little goes a long way.  I have been using it twice a day and it is very gentle on my eyes.  Even if you get it into your eye you will feel no discomfort. (There are many reviews that have had irritation so your experience may be different than mine)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it 3+ stars as it works as well as my current eye cream but it is 12.00 more in price.  I am going to continue to use it and if it does get rid of those pesky lines under my eyes I will update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you looking to switch products this is a good one to try and far less than high end products with similar ingredients.</li>
    <li> I was very excited about trying this new product. I have pronounced crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes. Upon first inspection, I thought the triangular jar was unique and attractive. However, when I lifted the safety seal from the cream, the product oozed over the edges. Not a good sign! Also, I found it very difficult to reseal. The jar never quite fully closed again. I was careful to follow the recommended application directions since I have experienced sensitivity issues in the past. The cream is soft to the touch and is odorless. Approximately ten minutes after usage, my eyes started to tear. In the morning, I felt a burning sensation in my eyes whenever I touched them. I tried the cream two consecutive nights and had the same results. Needless to say, I am no longer using this cream. I have rated it as average since my aversion to the eye cream is solely based on my sensitivity and not the effectiveness of the product.</li>
