<li> I&#x27;ve been using BARE MINERALS make-up for several years now.</li>
<li> This is not real bare minerals.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other mineral powders but have always come back to Bare Minerals.</li>
<li> I have been using it for years and have tried other less expensive mineral powders, but Bare Minerals is so much better.</li>
<li> My item arrived earlier than expected.  </li>
<li> I have been using the same shade and brand for 6 years, and could tell almost immediately that these are not genuine Bare Minerals.</li>
<li> an other was orange, the font isn&#x27;t the same as the one I bought at the mall</li>
<li> It was not nearly as good as the real product.</li>
<li> I will use it up because it is not that bad just have to use more to cover my problem areas.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals Medium for years &amp; usually buy it at Ulta, it costs around $40.</li>
<li> I knew it was not real after that.</li>
<li> Its less expensive, and I receive it within days, very fast!</li>
<li> Took it to ULTA where I usually buy my BareMInerals and compaired the same shade.</li>
<li> When I opened it to use it the powder looked dark in color, but when I applied it the shade was lighter than it should be.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t like anything heavy on my face.  </li>
<li> It hides imperfections without being heavy and &#x27;made up&#x27; looking.</li>
<li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to cover as well as what I have bought in the store like maybe it is missing</li>
<li> This is FAKE BARE MINERALS.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
<li> Wrong color but not worth return by the time you pay shipping both ways</li>
<li> and my wife was not a happy camper.</li>
<li> IT IS FAKE.  </li>
<li> so bad.</li>
<li> Bad cetaceans made me break out badly.</li>
<li> This stuff is awful.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product just because its cheaper than in the stores. Same mistake I made, and when I received it, I thought something was amiss. The coverage felt different. In fact there wasnt any coverage! Took it to ULTA where I usually buy my BareMInerals and compaired the same shade. So totally different. Some kind of shimmer in this one. Almost like its a blush, not foundation. Just a warning.</li>
    <li> Fast service and a great product!!</li>
    <li> Wrong color but not worth return by the time you pay shipping both ways</li>
    <li> I received this product March 2014. I immediately noticed a coverage problem. It was not nearly as good as the real product. But my main issue with it is it broke out my face so bad. I knew it was not real after that. You cannot purchase Bare Escentuals Bare Minerals for those bargain prices. I would rather spend a little more and know what I am using on my skin. This stuff is awful.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this. She began using bareminerals about 10 years ago. This is all she will use. Looks natural, wears all day. Easy to remove but does not rub off.  Covers imperfections, skin color variations well.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and amazing product.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  I have been using it for years and have tried other less expensive mineral powders, but Bare Minerals is so much better.</li>
    <li> I have used BareMinerals for years and I love it. It goes on quickly and easily, there is no &amp;#34;makeup line&amp;#34;. All the BareMineral products I have used I really like.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Totally natural feeling.  It feels as if I&#x27;m not even wearing any makeup!  I have tried another mineral foundation but it didn&#x27;t have the same natural look as this product.  I have been using Bare Escentuals BareMinerals foundation for several years now. I would recommend it for anyone who wants a natural look and doesn&#x27;t want the feel of traditional makeup on their skin.</li>
    <li> This is not real bare minerals. IT IS FAKE.  Do not buy it.  Bad cetaceans made me break out badly. Definitely not BM standards.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using BARE MINERALS make-up for several years now. It is wonderful, light coverage. It hides imperfections without being heavy and &#x27;made up&#x27; looking. Finding it at AMAZON and for such a good price was great.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  I love how my skin looks and receive compliments how flawless and radiant my face looks when I use it.</li>
    <li> I use this powder every time I wear make up. It covers &amp; the color is perfect. Covers up what I need covered up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other mineral powders but have always come back to Bare Minerals. The selection of products is wonderful. The primer is the best!</li>
    <li> I have been using this produst for over a year.  I don&#x27;t like anything heavy on my face.  This product is easy to use and feels great on my skin.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. I use this all the time</li>
    <li> Great face powder, Very good transaction. No problems, would use this seller again.</li>
    <li> have used this product for years with excellent results&lt;br /&gt;will never use anything else</li>
    <li> My item arrived earlier than expected.  I was pleased with that.  When I opened it to use it the powder looked dark in color, but when I applied it the shade was lighter than it should be.  I would think if this is true bare minerals makeup, it should apply as the medium shade it states it is.</li>
    <li> I have been using the same shade and brand for 6 years, and could tell almost immediately that these are not genuine Bare Minerals. Maybe one could be fooled into thinking so if they had never used the brand before. It&#x27;s an absolute joke, they should not be able to sell fake Bare Minerals on a legitimate site such as this.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem like the real bare minerals. It&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; as it should be. Also, it seemed to have a glitter/illuminating aspect to it which I personally don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> I only use bare minerals for makeup but have to frugal. This was at such a good price I couldn&#x27;t say no. Same excellent quality, too.</li>
    <li> This is the only foundation product I&#x27;ll use for the rest of my life ... Looks natural and covers my many imperfections.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years. This doesn&#x27;t seem to cover as well as what I have bought in the store like maybe it is missing an ingredient or something has been changed. I will use it up because it is not that bad just have to use more to cover my problem areas.</li>
    <li> I have been using Bare Escentuals for years.  And will continue for more years.  Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Always what I expect from BareMinerals. There is nothing out there like it. Tried generic and other store brands but this works the best for me.</li>
    <li> This is FAKE BARE MINERALS.&lt;br /&gt;Also check the expiration dates on these. If you compare the REAL BARE MINERALS with this product, you will see that there is a difference in the SKU Numbers, Difference in Colors, and Packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff must a knock-off version from China or something. Overall, the colors were way off and my wife was not a happy camper.</li>
    <li> I have been a BareMinerals product user for about 10 years.  I love the light coverage of this product.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Just what I wanted!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered twice Bare Minerals and will continue to do so. Its less expensive, and I receive it within days, very fast!</li>
    <li> Love this make-up. Thank you for selling it at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Cheap, I bought 2 and one was sheer an other was orange, the font isn&#x27;t the same as the one I bought at the mall so I don&#x27;t think its real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals Medium for years &amp; usually buy it at Ulta, it costs around $40. It is much cheaper on here and now I know why... its not the same product. It almost seems like it diluted. Normally I am 100% satisfied with Bare Minerals but i will only buy from a certified retailer from now on. Lesson learned.</li>
