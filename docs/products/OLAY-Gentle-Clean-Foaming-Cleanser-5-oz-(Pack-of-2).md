<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The first Face Wash that I can use long term without causing blemishes.  There are times I think I&#x27;ll try another brand (or husband buys the non-sensitive version of Olay), and my face breaks out almost immediately.  Start using this again, and my face is clean, smooth, and not overly dry.</li>
    <li> Bought it at a great price from Amazon/Olay promotion.  Like that it&#x27;s fragrance free and seems to work well, just don&#x27;t like the slick/slimy feel as u rinse it off your face, giving you the impression that it&#x27;s not coming off and you keep rising trying to wash it off! lol  other than that, it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I can swear by this product that it works     Okay first off it doesnt really help with my acne but it helps in getting everything off. I wear Eyeliner, and bb cream on my face. At the end of each day I squirt a little of this into my hand and rub it onto my eyes. Ive never had a problem with stinging but I never really open my eyes when washing them in the first place. Anywho it gets all of my eye makeup/concealer off very fast. Then I wash my eyes and then squirt a little more onto my hand and wash my face. It gets off the foundation quick. My face always feels soft after using this. I have sensitive skin so I am very careful with what I use. They gave this facewash a new look a few months back and I nearly panicked when I didnt see this at target anymore. Little did I know they were just making the bottle prettier also the price of it went up in stores. I usually paid 3-4 dollars but now its nearly 5 dollars. Buying on here save me a few bucks in the long run. (buying necessities with the \\&quot;super saver shipping\\&quot; policy\\&quot; Im rambling now.    All in all ive been using this product for the past 3 years. It doesnt hurt my skin whatsoever and it gets off all the makeup fast. It doesnt contain any acne treating ingredients but I know its keeping my skin clean day and night.     Great product also shipping from this company was very quick.</li>
    <li> I doubt that the product I received is not genuine. It does not foam at all. It is not gentle either and dries out my skin. I will use it as body wash just not to waste it.</li>
    <li> I bought \\&quot;Clarins\\&quot; foam face wash imagine I paid $20.00 plus tax for a product so equal to this one, everything is so similar, I could not believe it!!! I bought 2 of them for not even half of the price for one foam wash from \\&quot;Clarins\\&quot;, my skin isn&#x27;t  oily, it really is a combination normal to dry, I don&#x27;t feel any dryness, irritation or any bad effect, all the opposite my skin feels smooth, clean and with a nice soft smell, I highly recommend this product to any one, and I dare you to compare this product with the one from \\&quot;Clarins\\&quot; brand you will be amazed. I love this product, I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> The product is great. It is one of the only things that does not burn my face. The packaging does not work well. I find that it leaks if the cap isn&#x27;t carefully fastened.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash because it cleans without stripping all the ph from my skin and has no fragrance.</li>
    <li> do not buy it or you will be disappointed ! !!! it is the worst face wash I have bought.</li>
    <li> I did lots and lots of research for several different facial products. Based on my research, this facial cleanser was one that had the least amount of people who had reactions to it. Also, it is very safe for your skin with no ridiculous harsh chemicals, it was rated very well on the EWG&#x27;s (Environmental Working Group) cosmetic database and other sources as well. And of course, my skin feels great when I use it. It extracts clogged pores very well and leaves your skin feeling clean. The lather is perfect and easy to create. It also doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. Perfect inexpensive choice for all skin types in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Ordered this along with Nature&#x27;s Gate Organics Liquid Hand Soap. Package broke somewhere along the way and so did the soap. Now everything is covered in soap and dirt. The tubes look like someone wrung them as hard as they could and are mangled. Amazon subscribtions are terrible. I bought them to save me time, but they are just wasting my time.</li>
    <li> Not a huge fan. It dries my skin out way too much. I could never use this without immediately toning and moisturizing. Otherwise my skin starts feeling brittle and tight, a bit irritated and starts peeling on my cheeks and forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the future I&#x27;ll probably look for products that won&#x27;t dry me out so much. Probably ones with less chemicals and whatnot.</li>
    <li> This product contains Sodium Lauryl Sulfate which is a really harsh chemical used for the lathering effect. I didn&#x27;t realize until I ordered it. I don&#x27;t use it because of that even though it works. If you have a few extra dollars you can get a better cleanser (probably not a 2 pack though), but your body is your temple so treat it well :)</li>
    <li> Okay wash, but I&#x27;m not sure about the sensitive skin label. I have very sensitive skin on my face and just about everything causes breakouts, so it might just be me. The wash is nice enough, but it leaves this film on my skin that I&#x27;m guessing is supposed to help moisturize but for me just makes my face feel itchy and not clean. Switched to Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Daily Cleanser and it seems to work better.</li>
    <li> Before I found this face wash, I was use to spending many times more for face wash from the likes of BioTherm and Shiseido. This one works well, along with the exfoliation version. It works well and is SOOO MUCH cheaper.</li>
    <li> My skin is hypersensitive due to a retinol product I used months ago.  This is the only cleanser I can use that doesn&#x27;t make my face feel tight and dry.  It definitely does a good job at removing makeup and leaves my face feeling soft and smooth.  It doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance, which my sensitive skin appreciates.  It is also reasonably priced.  I have more expensive cleansers but they often leave my skin flushed and angry.  This is my go-to cleanser and I recommend it for anyone with very sensitive skin.  I will be using it for the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> Great price for a 2 pack! This burns when you get it in or around your eye. You don&#x27;t need a whole lot, especially if you use a buffer or something to lather up other than your fingers. Lathers nicely, lots of bubbles, glides smoothly and cleans well, but you might need to rinse a little longer. Leaves my skin less dry than most face washes which is a plus, I like that I don&#x27;t need to immediately apply lotion. All in all I would repurchase because it&#x27;s a great price and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to! Only real bummer for me is that I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s and this doesn&#x27;t have any acne fighting ingredients in it so my skin is misbehaving a little more than normal and if you&#x27;re not careful and don&#x27;t close the tube up properly the product will leak all over the place :(</li>
    <li> This has been my go to face wash for mornings and night.  At night I do use a facial make up remove wipe to get my makeup off.  I then use the foaming face wash to cleanse my face.  I feel like it is lite on my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling tight.</li>
    <li> as a male, i am usually a bit nervous that some products will smell to girly.  this product is fine and works well.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash! I have very sensitive skin and found this a few years ago and have never looked back. It is easy on the skin and cleans really well. I wash my face twice a day with this and always put on the olay moisturizing face lotion (for sensitive skin) after. My skin looks and feels very soft.</li>
    <li> I find this to be a bit too greasy, and my eyes feel like they have a greasy film in them when I use it to remove eye makeup while I wash my face. I feel like it doesn&#x27;t wash my face very well, because it is so greasy. I&#x27;ve used much better face washes for sensitive, dry skin and would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> i have always loved this product, it foams up nicely and rinses well, it is not over-drying.  This is a a great price, I will continue to buy it from amazon as long as they have it.</li>
    <li> Excellent foaming and cleansing of my face with this one.  Face seems a tad dry afterwards and desperately looking for my moisturizer but think that is just my skin type...great buy</li>
    <li> I got this for my rosacea and combination skin.I am 52,and my skin still acts like a teenager&#x27;s.it is very mild,and works wonders on my skin.Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this.  It cleans without drying.  There&#x27;s no frangrance, which is awesome.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife, since I remember she uses it, but for the price I got two, and she was more than happy.&lt;br /&gt;Great deal and good price...Perfect!</li>
    <li> If a pea-size of this face wash would lather/foam like the product I&#x27;ve been using I will continue using this face wash because it leaves my face with that smooth clean feeling.</li>
    <li> A good gentle wash. My skin feels soft and a little dry after use, which is nice when following the wash with toner and moisturizer. I think it&#x27;s minimized my pores while maintaining my acne free skin.</li>
    <li> 5 is what i would give to this product from Olay. This brand has till date lived upto my expectation with not only this facewash but even many other products that they have to offer in market.&lt;br /&gt;Best part about this facewash is it not only cleans and clear&#x27;s your skin but even makes you feel fresh and freshness that last&#x27;s long.</li>
    <li> The big positive for me is that this is one of the rare cleansers that don&#x27;t contain chemicals like propylene glycol or cocamidol betaine which I am allergic to. However, it wasn&#x27;t as effective at helping me with my blemishes like other cleansers do so I don&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash and you just can&#x27;t beat the price from Amazon!  It takes off all of my eye make-up and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin painfully dry.  This is a staple in my home!</li>
    <li> This cleans well, but not to the extent that my skin feels dry and tight--which causes irritation and breakout.  I have tried a few things, and this is the first one that worked.  I have been using a three-step anti-acne wash--one of the proactiv knockoffs.  That kept my skin really clear and not broken out, but it causes sensitivity to sun.  I go out in the sun a lot and had to find an alternative--this is it.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT.  OLAY HAS SOME FINE PRODUCTS FOR MINIMAL COST.</li>
    <li> A great value. Doesn&#x27;t really lather up. But leaves face feeling clean. Maybe a bit dry. Would buy again, if available on subscribe n save,</li>
    <li> Really like this brand despite the fact in am a guy, it is leaves your skin feeling clean, not overly drying, perfect for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this before. But one of these split across the top the first time I used it. Seems there is an issue with their packaging.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and this is the only thing I have found that works for me and does not cause my skin to break out.  It is unfortunate, because it is getting harder and harder to find.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this product. The Olay Foaming Face Wash is a very good cleanser. It leave your skin feeling really clean.</li>
    <li> Very gentle but a little hard to rinse.</li>
    <li> Nice facial wash with no added scents. I have sensitive skin so it&#x27;s essential for me not to have fragrances and other things in my soaps. This item was perfect for my needs. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of facial cleansers. You name it. I&#x27;ve used it. This is the only wash that has completely cleaned removed my makeup and gently cleaned my face consistently, without drying out my face. (The only other cleanser that has come close is Cetaphil for normal to oily skin. It removed my makeup but dried my skin a little. Still, not a bad cleanser either.) After 2-3+ years of using the Olay sensitive skin cleanser, I&#x27;ve officially stopped trying others. Thank you, Amazon for selling this wash! And thank you, Olay, for making this wash for people with combination/oily/sensitive skin like me. Please, never discontinue this cleanser!</li>
    <li> I wish this didn&#x27;t come in a 2-pack, since it just means that I have more to use up.  This face wash leaves a slimy residue on my skin, so it feels dirtier than before I washed it.  No matter how much I try to rinse the wash off, it still feels gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy this product again and am getting close to just throwing it away.  Save yourself the trouble by not buying the Olay Foaming Face Wash.</li>
    <li> Great wash! Takes off makeup and leaves skln soft. I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin. Love the price too!</li>
    <li> I bought this back in February 2014 and am finally getting around to using the first of two. This cleanser is acting stale. It comes out of the bottle like clear gel and as I rub my hands together to create foam, it only turns gooey. I have used the Combo/Oily version previous to this and that one foams okay. This one cleans my face well though. As I dry and touch my face, it feels very clean. It almost feels like my face was stripped of everything but yet doesn&#x27;t feel dry. I would only buy this cleanser if it&#x27;s cheap and on sale, but otherwise, I have used better facial cleansers.</li>
    <li> GREAT LATHER! YOU DON&#x27;T NEED TO USE A LOT</li>
    <li> Perfect for my skin! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This face wash works amazingly. It clears up pimples and leaves face feeling clean. I use it morning and night. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> When I&#x27;m looking for a FOAMING face wash, I indeed want it to foam.  This is probably the  LEAST foaming wash I&#x27;ve ever tried. It feels more like I&#x27;m rubbing moisturizer on my face.  It&#x27;s just a bit to hard to rinse off too. I feel like I&#x27;ve already put cream on my face after I use it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this face wash for a few years and I have tried other face washes but this is my fave of them all and I would rather use this over any of the others I had tried.&lt;br /&gt;I have really sensitive and oily skin, but this wash doesn&#x27;t bother me nor dry me out too much, it leaves me fresh and soft and well clean.&lt;br /&gt;Lovelovelove.</li>
    <li> It is very soft. It would not foam, so doesn&#x27;t give the feeling of Olay foaming face was at all. It feels like Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser.</li>
    <li> Great product for normal-to-dry skin!  Love this.  Cleanses, but leaves a little moisture behind.  No tightness in my face after use.</li>
    <li> The Ceravie faoming cleanser is better.</li>
    <li> My favorite face wash..i will never use anything else :) I have very clear skin but sometimes it gets a little dry because I go Tanning but this stuff works wonders</li>
    <li> Wife likes the product, it does the job.  Doesn&#x27;t break her out or dry out her face, she really likes it.</li>
    <li> I am pretty picky when it comes to face wash. My skin is oily and sensitive and I have previously always used clean and clean products. On a whim I decided to try this face wash since i have never used a Olay product before. I totally have fallen in love. I am a huge fan. The smell is great when washing your face in the shower. It isn&#x27;t as thick and goopey as some other washes are. I am def a fan of this wash.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this stuff works great--and even get my mascara off without much effort.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years.  My skin breaks out with most facial cleansers and moisturizers, but not with this.  Every single day of the year I trowel the makeup on as a public service.  I use Revlon&#x27;s ColorStay foundation (impossible to remove from clothing if it spills) and the mascara is always the waterproof kind.  Olay Sensitive Foaming Face Wash and a good nubby washcloth removes it all. No irritation, no redness, no breakouts.  Amazon&#x27;s price can&#x27;t be beat. What I paid for the 2-pack is what I was paying for a single one from the local WalMart when I used Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
    <li> I have been using this face wash for 10 years. I cannot live without it! I have sensitive skin and this wash doesn&#x27;t cause irritation. I wear a lot of eye makeup and this never fails to remove my mascara and eyeliner. I love it and dread the day it will be changed or taken off the market.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and love it!</li>
    <li> This face wash is delicate on my skin, foams well, leaves no residue, and has no offensive scent. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Nothing special.I will be switching to a more natural brand once this runs out. Too many chemicals and they do animal testing.</li>
    <li> My wife likes the scent.  She says it cleans well.  what more do you need from a face wash.</li>
    <li> Just started using this and I have already noticed that my skin is less dry and irritated after a cleaning.  It seems to have very little smell which I also like about this face wash.  I think that is just about all there is to say about this product.  It does what it says, clean with less irritation.</li>
    <li> I got this stuff because it&#x27;s recommended by the leading website forum on acne...  My skin is painfully, horribly dry 5 years after taking accutane... it sucks.  Don&#x27;t take accutane.  Most of my hair fell out too, and never grew back.  Whatever.  Wah wah waah.  Point is, it does have a faint odor that really does remind me of perfume, though it is not perfume, but it is a gross, chemically odor that shares the aspects of perfume that I hate.  I have used this stuff day after day for about a month; at first, it didn&#x27;t bug me.  Now, I&#x27;m growing totally repulsed.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to over dry the skin, but it doesn&#x27;t really rinse clean, either, which would be fine, if it didn&#x27;t have any repugnant aspects.  It is better than anything scented, that&#x27;s for damn sure.  It&#x27;s just... not so good.</li>
    <li> My skin is super dry and needs care but this product works for me. It&#x27;s smooth and soft in texture. I give this product full points. I simply love it.</li>
    <li> Great face wash, not thick but feels good on face. Produces some foam, not too much, but enough. Good product!</li>
    <li> Good smooth and gentle</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that would at least so something for my face. I have sensitive skin and use a lot of things to lessen my acne, large pores, and acne scars. I&#x27;ve tried wash after wash after wash. This one is nothing spectacular in regards to face washes. I figure for the price and size, it was a good steal. BUT, this face wash is nothing special. I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in my acne, which of course I wouldn&#x27;t since this doesn&#x27;t contain anything to help acne. It&#x27;s not the worst, but it&#x27;s not the best. I&#x27;d recommend Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Facial Cleanser, which is more pricy of course, but it really did a lot to clear up my face. Or any of the Petal Fresh Botanical products, which have done wonders for me. Once I&#x27;m done with these two Olay face washes, I will definitely not buy these again. I guess that&#x27;s what I get for buying these washes, since it doesn&#x27;t have anything to help with acne, pores, scars, or anything. The one thing I do like is that after I pat dry my face, this wash doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry. It makes my face feel smooth and like it still has some moisture.</li>
    <li> I still find that my forehead is still a bit dry and flaky after using this facial wash even though it says it is for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> this does not foam. I buy foaming face cleaner only because it&#x27;s fun. this comes out as a gel and then it turns into a &amp;#34;LATHER,&amp;#34; not foam. and because it&#x27;s more trouble than it&#x27;s worth I will not be returning. but I am not having fun! (cleans perfectly well, tho&#x27;.)</li>
    <li> Great facial wash excellent seller Thank you</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t play well with my skin.  I may be allergic to something in this.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin, get this product. If you have dry or oily skin, get this stuff as well. This product is one of the best products I have tried that defeat the oil and dry face types, since I have a mixture of both depending on the seasons. I especially like the foam since it makes me feel as if my face is getting extra clean. I definitely recommend this face wash to ANYONE. Makes my face feel amazing and I will DEFINITELY buy this product again. You have my word on it.</li>
    <li> What I like best about this face wash is that I can use it to remove mascara (non-waterproof) without having to be rough on my eyes. I have been using it for years, and my skin was the happiest after I stopped using harsher cleansers (even during my acne periods in college) and used this with a spot cleanser for blemishes. Also, the smell is understated and pleasant. I had to buy it here on Amazon because my local stores weren&#x27;t carrying it anymore. :/</li>
    <li> I always use Olay, but this was cheaper than going to the store. I&#x27;m will be looking for more good deals.</li>
    <li> This is kind of like the Cetaphil gentle face wash.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s doing much but it cleans the crud off your face without drying like soap.</li>
    <li> I love it, but the only drawback is it will dry out your face just like using soap. I only use it to wash my face when I take a shower, but in the dry winter weather it dries our your skin. Keep a moisturizer handy.</li>
    <li> This is the only stuff that doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin. It&#x27;s absolutely wonderful as a cleanser. However, I also have acne and was trying to get rid of that, but it&#x27;s not as effective for that purpose. Cleanser, great, wonderful, and very attuned for sensitive skin. Anti-acne, not so much.</li>
    <li> love this stuff can&#x27;t buy enough</li>
    <li> For as long as I&#x27;ve known him, this is the only cleanser my husband with very sensitive skin uses. He has oily skin. I use the nice lather for shaving cream!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a sensitive skin foaming face wash. This item is good for sensitive skin, however it doesn&#x27;t foam very much and I didn&#x27;t feel that it cleaned my face well. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> My favorite face wash. Can&#x27;t beat the 2 pack price.</li>
    <li> Have not tried yet but these are nice and big the size...great value for the money. I would purchase agaun !</li>
    <li> The best face wash ever because it removes all...I mean all...makeup!  In addition, I use this daily and it it does not over dry my skin.  I have also noticed I have less break outs and my skin is clearer.</li>
    <li> it does clean my face but it does not foam I feel its like the other soaps I use but it is for sensitive skin because it does not dry my face</li>
    <li> No harsh chemical and provide good clean facial cleaner at a great price.  Not a bad way to spend your money!</li>
    <li> This is the only face wash I can use on my face at the moment. I tried using a bunch of other &amp;#34;gentle/for sensitive skin&amp;#34; facial washes but I always go back to this one. As cleanliness is very crucial to my condition, I use this face wash three times a day and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out too much. It also helps with the redness and irritations I experience from time to time. My only complain is that it doesn&#x27;t lather that much so it takes quite an effort to make a nice foam.</li>
    <li> I recently bought some expensive face wash to use with my Clarisonic and I had previously used this product.  I felt that the Olay face wash was better and I got 3 for the price of the other expensive one.  It works perfectly with my Clarisonic and I feel that my face is super clean without over drying.</li>
    <li> Probably the best face wash I&#x27;ve ever used.  Gentle but through cleansing.  Rinses off completely and leaves my skin soft and fresh.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that is normal with an oily tzone. This does not irritate or make me break out. It is a gel when it comes out not a foam. It&#x27;s a great value and I will order again.</li>
    <li> It is good for times/days when I don&#x27;t want a cleaner that will dry out my face. Just your average wash.</li>
    <li> the product isn&#x27;t so great</li>
    <li> This is a high rating because when I use this product it does not irritate my sensitive skin.  No perfumed smell makes it a pleasure to use.  Would recommend this to those with sensitive skin issues.</li>
    <li> I first got this because I was diagnosed with rosacea and my dermatologist adviced me to buy products for &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34;. I started researching about the subject and found the reviews of Paula Begoun and beautypedia.com and she recommended this cleanser as one of the best bargains for skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It removes makeup so easily, my eyes dont sting after I removed my waterproof mascara, the skin doesnt feel itchy or dry after, as with many other cleansers. Its water-soluble so it doesnt leave any residues. My skin has been great since I started this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what a better buy if for almost the same price, I get two!!!  :D</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cleanser, and an excellent value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a man with combination-oily skin, this cleanser does a great job of removing facial oil and sunscreen, without over-drying my skin. Unlike some of the more typical &amp;#34;oily skin&amp;#34; foaming face washes, this one never seems to strip my skin, or make it feel tight. There&#x27;s a moderate amount of foaming, but not overly so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Importantly, as someone with sensitive skin, this cleanser has never irritated my skin or exacerbated any allergies.</li>
    <li> This is a great item and the price is outstanding.  I love the wash as it does not dry my skin or sting my eyes.  The tubes are much larger than I expected.  Spectacular deal!!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin oily....not for my skin.  Might be for others. Not sure why this product does not work for my skin.</li>
    <li> REALLY ENJOY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I started using the Olay sensitive face wash about 1 week ago, and I love this cleanser! It comes in a 6 oz. tube which will last quite awhile as you only need about a dime size amount to effectively cleanse your face. This cleanser is non-greasy and will not break you out. Benefits are evening skin tone, light moisturizing, no fragrance, and very reasonably priced @ $6 to $7. Perfect for dry, sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I pair this with the new Olay Fresh Effects exfoliating cleanser, mixing the two together for one cleansing step. The exfoliating cleanser is another excellent product for dry, sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that I did not try the sensitive wash sooner.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Olay sensitive face wash to anyone with dry, sensitive skin. Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> This makes my skin so SO dry!  It cleans, but at a price.  I always feel like I have to use a ton of moisturizer after this.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is very mild and gentle, soap-free and foaming.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s deep cleansing , but most deep cleansers tend to strip away all of your natural skin oil and leave you too dry, so I&#x27;d prefer this over something too intense. I like that it&#x27;s fragrance free as well so I don&#x27;t feel like I am washing my face with a perfume. If there is another brand I&#x27;d compare to, I think this would be an affordable version of Kiehl&#x27;s ultimate cleanser.</li>
    <li> I am giving this item only 4 stars because I have used better drug store products. This is really good for sensitive skin and people who have clear skin. If you have bad skin such as pimples etc i wouldn&#x27;t recommend. I have very clear skin to it works good for my type of skin also the price was right and it came with a pack of 2</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite face washes.  It is a gentle, slightly creamy (but not too heavy), foaming face wash that removes makeup.  It foams up well, so you do not have to use a ton of product to wash your face.  It is pretty through at removing makeup, but I would still recommend using a gentle (non-alcohol) toner with it to make sure you remove every trace of makeup. It leaves your face feeling clean but not overly dry like some other face washes do.</li>
    <li> Works well.  I think my skin is a little too oily for this product but it doesn&#x27;t make me break out or anything. Lasts quite awhile too.</li>
    <li> Cheap looking picture of the Matisse type woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However product feels richer than the drug store price portends.  Nice and truly fragrance free.</li>
    <li> Good face wash. What else to say? If the price is right, then buy! Especially with subscribe &amp; save. Sometimes your local store may have a better price with coupon.</li>
