      <li>My skin felt completely refreshed and as if it had been toned by the smallest possible drop of gel the first time I tried this cleanser, and I&#x27;ve been enjoying the same wonderful results every subsequent time I&#x27;ve used this wonderful product.</li>

      <li>It smells heavenly, and left my skin soft without grease, clean without tightness, and ready to accept the next step in the treatment (which is awesome).  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My husband and I both use this cleanser along with the fruit acid peel and the salicylic acid peel.  We&#x27;ve both had so much progress in terms of skin health and appearance.  My closed comodones went away - which I had since I was a teenager - and my few darks spots have nearly faded completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We purchased our first bottle in November and it&#x27;s now the beginning of April and we&#x27;re about to purchase our second.  1 bottle lasted about 5 months for 2 people.  You don&#x27;t need much product.  I use about less than the size of a pea - you&#x27;re only washing your face, it&#x27;s not that big.</li>
    <li> i love this facial cleanser. i also use other products and rotate. smells good and leaves your skin feeling clean. thanks</li>
    <li> Great cleanser goes a long way</li>
    <li> Seriously where&#x27;s the lather in this product?!!!</li>
    <li> Agreed with all of the reviews above. I returned from a steamy day running around the city on public transportation with a VERY dirty face. This had arrived in my mailbox, so of course, I rip it open and begin scrubbing. Well, I am not a big skin care person so the only comparison I can share is that it felt like my face had been waxed clean. You know that feeling when your eyebrows are waxed and the skin underneath feels so baby soft. Thats what this cleanser did for me. LOVE it.</li>
    <li> You know what I&#x27;m talking about...that soft, fresh, glowing face that is hiding under a few years of dry, dull, congested skin. Be it from weather, age, clogged pores (or in my case, ALL of the above!), this is your first step to putting your best face forward.&lt;br /&gt;Some of my favorite ingredients are used in this nourishing formulation, like rose hip oil and seaweed extract. It&#x27;s a gel that foams a bit with water, thanks to olive oil derived castile. Nothing irritating or artificial here. Not one &#x27;safety flagged&#x27; ingredient, and no hidden ingredients. Other products that list &#x27;fragrance&#x27; or &#x27;parfum&#x27; can hide a lot of unsafe chemicals under those names, at least those sold in the USA. Chemicals banned or regulated in the skin care products in other countries can hide under &#x27;fragrance&#x27; here.&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing with cool water, apply your toner and moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Or, this can be the first step for an exfoliating treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have skin that can react badly to certain products. I had no redness or irritation with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that this product is not tested on animals, and is made in the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample was provided for review</li>
    <li> This product has made no difference at all in the appearance of my skin. I&#x27;m almost done with the bottle and my dark spots haven&#x27;t faded, my skin doesn&#x27;t appear smoother, healthier, brighter.... I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> I really like  the Rose face wash. It smells great,  applies easily like any liquid soap product, and lathers up well. It does a great job cleaning your face, gently. After use my face felt more alive, fresh and clean. I could actually see the difference, that was nice. I liked this product very much.&lt;br /&gt;I used The Rose Face Wash, Glycolic Peel, and Moisturizer together from this company. I have to say these products work well. My face feels refreshed and soft after use. I have sensitive skin and allergies so I must take extra cautions when using a product, but I had no problems with these products and no allergies. I recommend this regiment, and these products. You like what you see in the mirror.  I received free samples of these products for a fair and honest review</li>
    <li> This facial cleanser leaves my skin feeling clean and very soft. I have older, normal to dry skin with some past sun damaged areas. This makes my skin feel completely clean without feeling dry and tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells so pretty and just takes a few drops to thoroughly clean face and neck area. It lathers up beautifully too. Rinsed away completely with a few splashes of warm water leaving no traces of make up or lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a sample of this product to try for my honest opinion. That having been said I really do like this  facial cleanser and since I have started using it my skin feels  great!</li>
    <li> I recently was provided with several products to review by this company and over all I really like them especially the fruit acid peel. This product was no exception. It cleanses nicely and gently. However, I marked it down for two reasons. I found it a bit thick to come out of the bottle. And I feel at 4 ounces at the current price of $18.00 it is pricey. There are other cleansers that claim to balance the PH of your skin that are much pricier, but there are also quality products like Eucerin and Cetaphil that are gentle on the skin and could be used to prepare the skin for a peel that give you more ounces for your dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a nice indulgence and works well with the fruit acid peel and moisturizer made by the same company but you could also use another quality cleanser instead as your prep for the peel and moisturizer.</li>
    <li> (Full disclosure: I received a free product from the manufacturer in exchange for an honest review.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In exchange for an honest review, Refresh Skin Therapy sent me a bottle of its Pre-Peel Rose Glow Cleanser, along with its Fruit Acid 15% Gel Peel and Hyaluronic Pure Moisturizing Cream for post-peel reparation and restoration. I used all three products three times a week (the maximum recommended dose for the peel) for about eight weeks. After nearly two months of use, I still have about 80% of the bottle left; ditto on the fruit peel. While on the pricey side, if used as directed, both products should last for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about the cleanser is its smell. It’s rather strong. Not unpleasant, just…very in-your-face. If you’re sensitive to smells (I’m not), this could be dealbreaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is moderately thick and manages to work up a decent lather. I found that I don’t need a whole lot to cover my entire face; a dab the size of a penny will usually suffice. The cleanser often leaves my face feeling dry, but this is par for the course as far as facial cleansers are concerned; and I’m sure my combination skin doesn’t exactly help matters. I inherited sensitive skin from my mother, and the Pre-Peel Rose Glow Cleanser didn’t cause any problems – rashes, breakouts, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I’m not about to replace my daily cleanser (Dr. Bronner’s Magic Soaps; I like the Almond-scented and Unscented Baby/Mild varieties) any time soon, the Pre-Peel Rose Glow Cleanser seems to have worked well in conjunction with the Fruit Acid 15% Gel Peel to minimize the appearance of some of my acne scars. In particular, I have one flat and one atrophic scar, both of them less than three months old, which bothered me. The Refresh products reduced the redness of these scars, with the most dramatic results occurring in the first month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve tried other, non-vegan products (such as Mederma) back in my omni days, with lackluster results; so it’s safe to say that my expectations for Refresh were rather low. I’m happy to report that, two months later, I’m pleasantly surprised with the results. And I still have a six month+ supply of cleanser and fruit peel to work with! (After the trial period, I started using the moisturizer on a regular basis, so I’m sorry to say that it’s already half gone. But it’ll be nice while it lasts!)h lackluster results; so it’s safe to say that my expectations for Refresh were rather low.

    <li> This is a refreshing facial wash with a light pleasant scent. My face feels good after I use this.</li>
    <li> I was given a review sample of Refresh Skin Therapy&#x27;s deep facial cleanser for use prior to applying their Fruit Acid Gel Peel, and I was truly surprised that a very small application of this cleanser is all that&#x27;s required to clean my entire face and neck and hands. My skin felt completely refreshed and as if it had been toned by the smallest possible drop of gel the first time I tried this cleanser, and I&#x27;ve been enjoying the same wonderful results every subsequent time I&#x27;ve used this wonderful product. Not only does my skin feel clean, but it feels a whole new level of clean--clean without any moisturizer having been included already in the wash. That makes this cleanser the perfect partner for the Refresh Fruit Acid Gel Peel, followed by the Refresh Pure Moisturizing Cream, which I also highly recommend.</li>
    <li> In the past, I have tried many types of cleansers for my DRY, SANDPAPER TYPE OF FACE and nothing worked that well. That is until this product! There are many reasons why I am very pleased with it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ This worked to removed old skin cells, and really clean my face. To achieve this result, the very first time that I used this, I followed the instructions and did two applications of this due to my super dry and very, very scaly skin. Results: All of the scaly parts came off and my skin is SOFT and does not feel like sandpaper anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ It has a tingling effect - Noticed even in my first application that it was deep cleaning my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy to apply according to directions. So I did follow directions and massage this in my face, then I used a rough washcloth that was wet and massaged this in with the washcloth. This helped to further remove the scaly skin and old skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Rinses off easily - Just to be sure, I rinsed TWICE to fully clean my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will it work for you? Yes, I believe it will because if this worked well for me with my SCALY and very DRY skin, it should work for anyone. Highly recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Provided by Refresh Skin Therapy for testing and review.</li>
    <li> This cleanser did nothing for me.  My skin does not feel exceptionally clean, in fact, it feels as though there is some residue.  Isn&#x27;t that the opposite of what a good pre peel cleanser should do?  I guess it is gentle...smells okay...Other than that, there is absolutely nothing special about this soap.  I noticed a lot of the good reviews were from people who were paid to try it and received a whole kit.  Pay me and give me free products, and I would say good things too!  As a paying customer expecting a 5 star cleanser, I am disappointed.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> Most of my face cleansers will make my face feel clean, but this one is different. This cleanser leaves my face feeling so clean it could squeak if I rubbed it. Recently my skin has been less that cooperative. My skin has been oily. Yuck. My usual exfoliants and cleansers haven&#x27;t helped. So I started using the [[ASIN:B00ICXI5QI Fruit Acid Gel Peel]] made by the same company as this cleanser, combined with the [[ASIN:B00IG9L8QM Hyaluronic Pure Moisturizing Cream ]]. I&#x27;ve been using all the products together as a 3-step process and have really liked the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser doesn&#x27;t leave your face with any kind of medicines or moisturizers on it. It leaves it completely bare so that a chemical peel can work it&#x27;s best. I LOVE that about this cleanser. I would use it all the time without being part of a process of prepping for a peel. I love the cool clean feeling I get when washing my face with it. The feeling of having my face completely clean without some residue of acne medication, skin softener, wrinkle fighter, etc is great. Just clean. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also something I really like about products made by this company is they are not tested on animals. Each product states this on the label. Animal testing for cosmetic purposes is a thing of the past and I appreciate that this company chooses not to participate in the inhumane and outdated practice. Also noted on the label is these products are made in America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review</li>
    <li> Refresh Skin Thearpy Reveal Pre-Peel Rose Glow Cleanser is the perfect cleanser to use before you use a Fruit Acid peel. It restores the skins natural PH. This cleanser contains olive oil castile, glycerin, rose hop seed oil, kumquat extract and seaweed extract. I think this cleanser can be used for any skin type but I have oily skin and I notice this deep cleanses my skin. I break out less while using it. You can use this in the shower but I like using it with a washcloth at night before I go to bed. Then I follow it with an application of the Hyaluronic Moisturizing cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product free for review. This review is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I love the way this cleanser smells. The rose scent gets me everytime. It is also really gentle on my skin, and I was amazed at how [re] freshed (get it? hehe) it made me feel. It doesn&#x27;t really foam up, but I don&#x27;t think all great cleanser&#x27;s need to. I would defiantly recommend this, if you are looking for something gentle for your skin but needing to get that deep clean as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this as a complementary product, however this is 100% my HONEST opinion. This in no way, shape, or form altered my perception or thought.</li>
    <li> I love my skin. I take care of my skin. It is the one thing I actually have a &amp;#34;routine&amp;#34; for. And I am always looking for new things to add to it. I was excited to learn about the [re]fresh skin therapy system and decided to give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These beauty items are really great and easy to use. Just wash your face using the Reveal pre-peel rose glow cleanser. Let me just say that it smells amazing. Like, I wanted to drink it, it smelled so good. After using it, I feel like my face is really clean and I love that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, just spread a thin layer of the fruit acid gel peel on your face (and neck if you want). It comes with a dropper and I only needed about 3-5 drops depending on if I was doing my neck or not. Leave it on for 1-3 minutes (I chose 2) and then wash with cool water to neutralize. I did not think it hurt at all and my face felt amazing afterwards. So smooth! These bottles will last me a long time - I would say at least 6 months. [re]fresh recommends only using once a month. I received this free in exchange for my unbiased, honest review. All opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I actually LOVE this cleanser. It has a light scent and the texture is a bit different than I have used. It is a bit gel and aloe like. It feels amazing on my skin and my face feels so clean after. I did not expect to love it so much. I use this nightly and wish it came in a large size. It cleanses very well and I like to use a soft sponge with it. I received this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts or opinions.</li>
    <li> I have loved using this natural face cleanser. The smell is so pure and clean and makes my skin feel the same way. I use it with a hand held exfoliating brush and really feel like I am buffing all of the goodness into my skin. Just love this!</li>
    <li> As I have gotten older, my skin has become drier and it has been a challenge to find effective facial cleansers.  I am happy to report that this product is very effective, yet gentle on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The best way to use this product is as a preparation for a facial peel.  It helps prepare restores the skin&#x27;s pH balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I like this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It works.  After using this, in combination with the Facial Peel and Moisturizer, my skin was noticeably brighter.&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s effective, yet gentle.  My face didn&#x27;t sting or feel dry after using this.&lt;br /&gt;* The natural ingredients.  Some of the ingredients include:  olive oil, rose hips seed oil, and Seaweed extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a product that will gently cleanse your face, you will enjoy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I was provided a free sample for testing and review.</li>
    <li> The manufacturer sent me this product for review as the first step in a triple whammy skin care routine.  It&#x27;s packaged in a no nonsense plastic bottle that in no way indicates the nature of what&#x27;s inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is simply lovely.  It&#x27;s rose, but in the real rose sense, not the chemical rose-like aroma that lots of inexpensive products contain.  It&#x27;s not cloying or overpowering, just definitely there.  It makes the product a pleasure to use for the several minutes suggested to thoroughly clean the face before proceeding to the next step in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I talk about effectiveness, please know that I&#x27;ve used just about every product on the market for face cleaning, from Noxema, Ivory soap, Neutrogena products, Philosophy, Dr. Pericone, Estee Lauder, Lancome, and Clinique, to whatever&#x27;s on the bathroom counter wherever I happen to be, like Dawn Dish Soap (don&#x27;t ask).  There&#x27;s a reason Refresh sent me this product, is what I&#x27;m saying!  Some products don&#x27;t clean well at all, some strip the skin, some leave the face feeling greasy, tight, or itchy, some cause breakouts, and some just feel detergent-y (no, not the Dawn--it was actually pretty good).  I think I&#x27;m qualified to speak as an expert consumer of skin products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rose Glow Gel does exactly what its name suggests.  It deep cleans without itching or stripping.  It smells heavenly, and left my skin soft without grease, clean without tightness, and ready to accept the next step in the treatment (which is awesome).  Whether you use this cleanser as a standalone--and you wouldn&#x27;t need to use it every day, it&#x27;s that thorough--or as part of the Refresh three part treatment routine, it&#x27;s a winner!</li>
    <li> Waste of money, would not recommend</li>
    <li> hmm okay. great scent, easy to rinse, for daily use.</li>
