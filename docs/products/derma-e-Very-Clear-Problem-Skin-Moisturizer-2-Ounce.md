      <li>It has a fresh healthy smell and keeps my face from cracking.</li>
      <li>and I feel good using a natural product.</li>

      <li>I do have a clean diet, so</li>
      <li>Apparently this product is working for alot of different people which is GREAT!</li>
      <li>I had been using the Dermae Hyrolaunic Acid eye cream and loved it so finally thought to give this line a try.</li>
      <li>Although the scent is really strong at first, it dissipates as it dries and you can pick up the varying scents that make up the lotion (lavender, peppermint).</li>
      <li>Will leave your skin feeling soft and moisturized, smells great, and to top it all off, it actually DOES help clear up skin problems!</li>
      <li>My skin is sensitive and breaks out with most moisturizers, but not this one.  </li>
      <li>I love the idea of organic products and paraben free anything so that instantly drew me to derma e!</li>
      <li>The results are worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I added tea tree oil to my toner, I apply it directly on spots, and am glad to have found this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping to get even more clear after I switch to a dermae toner instead of astringent.  </li>
      <li>My acne isn&#x27;t 100% clear but let me just tell you that its A LOT better than before.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Derma E provided the right moisturization for my face.  </li>
      <li>It has a very strong tea tree oil smell, which I personally do not like at all.  </li>
      <li>It has very pure ingredients, and is not oily or greasy.  </li>
      <li>I received the product only a few days after ordering, which is great!  </li>
      <li>Derma E Very Clear on the Spot Treatment and a LIGHT application of this moisturizer</li>
      <li>I was experiencing more breakouts than when I was a teen, and Derma E took care of it all!  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>The first couple times you use the product the smell will remind you of paint thinner.</li>
      <li>I almost cried, I was seeing results for the first time in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m almost done with my first jar.</li>
      <li>I have moderate hormonal acne resulting in mostly cysts.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t use too much of it!  </li>
      <li>so I know there that this moisturizer really is anti blemish and it does work!</li>
      <li>so i bought another moisturizer that burned my eyes the first time I used it</li>
      <li>I went so far as to try ProActiv with no results, and wanted to return to more natural products.</li>
      <li>They would become inflamed in large patches and it would hurt when ever I accidentally touched my face.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s mild and refreshing for my skin compared to harsh chemicals.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good about how well this has worked for me with the night cream twice a day(morning and night on my dry skin), exfoliate at night and cream wash in the morning.</li>
      <li>The moisturizer feels light-weight and works all day, even in our very cold/dry winter climate.</li>
      <li>and this stuff has really helped my complexion.  </li>
      <li>no real reason except looking for better hydration.</li>
      <li>My skin is so so much clearer</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>It smells earthy; be warned -- but works very well.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve found that it also helps acne scars heal much faster.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t use it very sparingly...</li>
      <li>I have noticed my face is free of pimples but gets the occasional zit</li>
      <li>and I have tried absolutely everything (from medicated acne creams to the drugstore ones)</li>
      <li>years, I have been struggling with combination to very oily skin.</li>
      <li>After 3-4 days of applying a liberal coat of it day &amp; night, acne scars from popped pimples (red, broken-skin sort of scars) heal to actually smooth skin.  </li>
      <li>(too much causes the moisturizer to ball up a bit).</li>
      <li>Have noticed a significant reduction in the oiliness of my skin since starting to use this product.</li>
      <li>, they are much smaller and clear very quickly.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product, but warn sensitive buyers about the potential strong odor.</li>
      <li>My acne has cleared up tremendously in the last month.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this cream! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I have tried EVERY over the counter product for acne.  This moisturizer is by far the best.  Some people may be turned off by the smell of the cream, but I find that it is a minor issue when compared with the results.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is very good.  It is not greasy  and makes my skin so soft.  My skin is sensitive and breaks out with most moisturizers, but not this one.  The smell is not my favorite, but the results are.  Have been using for about a month.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and live in a very dry climate (Colorado in winter, ouch!) and struggled to find a good facial moisturizer for months.  Most were too greasy or just didn&#x27;t last as long as I needed them to.  I was suggested to try this product and have found it to be the only thing that works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does smell like tea tree oil but the smell doesn&#x27;t last all day (only about 10-15 minutes, if you can stand it...I happen to love the smell though) but the moisturizer does!  The only thing I could possibly complain about is that they don&#x27;t have it in a bigger container but the 2 oz. has lasted me for about 3 months and I don&#x27;t use it very sparingly...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely suggest this moisturizer for anyone with acne or dry skin problems (my skin definitely has both :-/) and I hope you find it to be as wonderful as I do!</li>
    <li> My skin is normally fairly clear with only occasional breakouts usually due to hormonal changes. This cream has great essential oils in it that promote healthy skin. The cream is not overly rich and absorbs easily. I find my skin is less oily when I use this cream. I&#x27;ve mixed tea tree oil into other creams and it has been fairly effective. However in this cream there is also lavender oil, chamomile oil and rosewood oil. It also has willow bark in it which is calming to the skin. I like Derma E products because they are cruelty free and paraben free. This cream cleared up my skin in about seven days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is not only great to balance your skin out but I&#x27;ve found that it also helps acne scars heal much faster.  After 3-4 days of applying a liberal coat of it day &amp; night, acne scars from popped pimples (red, broken-skin sort of scars) heal to actually smooth skin.  Within 1-2 weeks on the same area and it fades leaving very little darkness to almost none whatsoever.    I&#x27;ve suffered from acne for years, and now accidentally coming across this new application I&#x27;m very very happy that I can avoid permanent scarring.    I use a normal application all over my face, and then just dab a tiny bit over the scarred area that is enflamed so that I can still see the white of the cream over the area.  When it dries, it disappears and then I can go to sleep.    Please let me know if this works for you too.  &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> After trying Proactive and literally burning my face (I had to ice my face for several days!), I knew I did not want to use harsh chemicals on my skin. I knew that I wanted a product with tea tree oil, so I gave Derma E a try.  It is AMAZING!  I was experiencing more breakouts than when I was a teen, and Derma E took care of it all!  I do have a clean diet, so I didn&#x27;t understand why I was breaking out.  Derma E provided the right moisturization for my face.  I realized that I had been drying my skin out too much, which was actually causing the acne.  I do have oily skin, but I lather this stuff on and it works perfectly.  You can&#x27;t use too much of it!  The more the merrier, in my opinion.  Do not be scared to use moisturizer as I was in the past.  Try this product, you will not regret it!</li>
    <li> I have bought Derma Moisturizer before and really liked it. It has a fresh healthy smell and keeps my face from cracking. When I went to buy it again it wasn&#x27;t on the shelf so i bought another moisturizer that burned my eyes the first time I used it so I couldn&#x27;t use it again. I found Derma on Amazon and replace what i loved before. Please don&#x27;t stop selling it. I am allergic to some makeup and lotions but not this one. Thanks</li>
    <li> I love this product and so does my family.  It has very pure ingredients, and is not oily or greasy.  It heals and clears every breakout without drying or irritation.</li>
    <li> This is the best ever organic moisturizer you can buy. Will leave your skin feeling soft and moisturized, smells great, and to top it all off, it actually DOES help clear up skin problems!</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  The ingredients are healthy and it keeps a good ph balance on your skin.  I put it on every morning and night.  I couldn&#x27;t be without this product.</li>
    <li> The problem with this cream is the smell. It has a terrible, rank tea tree like odor, which i imagine is the part of the cream that is supposed to give your skin a less blotchy look, more even skin tone. But when that cream gets under my nose and i. Inhale a few times i feel like gagging. I am upset that this was a 2 pack because i don&#x27;t think i can possibly use up 2 of these, and i don&#x27;t want to give it to someone and make them feel ill. Slightly lumpy cream, but smears well. Not too greasy.</li>
    <li> I first bought this product at a Whole Foods a few years ago and didn&#x27;t think of buying it here on Amazon until now.  Two jars for a little over $20 (includes s&amp;h) is such a good price, considering one jar at the store costs more than that, and it lasts such a long time.  I received the product only a few days after ordering, which is great!  I absolutely love this formula.  I&#x27;ve tried many natural moisturizers before, and this is unlike any other.  I have a combination of dry/oily, sensitive skin and this formula helps to balance it out.  It also minimizes areas of redness and helps to prevent breakouts.  I only use a very small amount on the tip of my finger and lightly dab it on my face 2x a day; once in the morning and then at night after washing with mild soap and water.  I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have been using the derma e Very Clear Problem moisturizer for 3 weeks now and love it! I am FINALLY getting clear skin! My acne scars are even starting to fade. It also cleared up my pre-teen daughter&#x27;s face (sensitive to combination skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, I have been struggling with combination to very oily skin. I am in my early thirties and my acne has been getting worse. Over the years I have tried numerous over the counter products (products with benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid make my acne much worse and dry out my skin too much- painful peeling at times), prescription Erythromycin (slightly improved acne, but still there) and prescription low dose oral antibiotic with a retinoid gel (horrible redness reaction and dry skin). Within 2 days of using this product, my skin finally started clearing- something I had not seen happen in years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The earthy smell may be offensive to some people, but doesn&#x27;t last long after application (the tea tree oil smell lasts about 10 minutes). I am very sensitive to smells but actually don&#x27;t mind this one too much. The results are worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daily Routine: I wash my face morning and night with Purpose Face Wash and follow with Derma E Very Clear on the Spot Treatment and a LIGHT application of this moisturizer (too much causes the moisturizer to ball up a bit). The moisturizer feels light-weight and works all day, even in our very cold/dry winter climate. Also, my face does not look as oily late in the day as it used to. I tried the matching face wash but didn&#x27;t like it as it didn&#x27;t take off mineral make-up and my face felt too greasy after use (same for morning and night).&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this moisturizer and recommend it!</li>
    <li> I honestly love this lotion. It is really thick and you don&#x27;t need very much to cover your entire face. I have noticed my face is free of pimples but gets the occasional zit a couple times a month. I was using Neutrogena and Clean&amp;Clear salicylic acne products, but couldn&#x27;t really get flawless skin. This product works better for my face and I feel good using a natural product. The only complaint I have, like many reviewers, is the smell. The first couple times you use the product the smell will remind you of paint thinner. Although the scent is really strong at first, it dissipates as it dries and you can pick up the varying scents that make up the lotion (lavender, peppermint). After it completely dries and I apply make-up, I can&#x27;t even smell the lotion (nor can anyone else). Although it is a little pricey, I feel like I am spending less money overall because I don&#x27;t need multiple products to get rid of pimples/zits. The lotion lasts a long time, I am  not even half way through the first container after 5 months. I highly recommend this product, but warn sensitive buyers about the potential strong odor. Also, I recommend using this product for 2 weeks before you judge its efficacy. The skin needs a couple weeks to get use to the new product, although my skin was good after a couple of days.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with hormonal acne on my skin for a couple of years now with it only getting worse and worse. I am in my 30s and hadworse acne now than ever before. I went so far as to try ProActiv with no results, and wanted to return to more natural products. I had been using the Dermae Hyrolaunic Acid eye cream and loved it so finally thought to give this line a try. My acne has cleared up tremendously in the last month. I can&#x27;t say enough good about how well this has worked for me with the night cream twice a day(morning and night on my dry skin), exfoliate at night and cream wash in the morning. It&#x27;s all natural so great in that regard as well. It does smell like tea tree so if you don&#x27;t like hat smell do not purchase this. Also, the cream can take a bit to soak in so you will need to leave time for this in your routine as it will leave a thick white residue for a few minutes until it soaks in. This has honestly changed my life with how great my skin feels. I&#x27;m going to try the skin evening serum from another line of Dermae to see if that helps with the scarring on my chin as this hasn&#x27;t yet.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but I felt like I should share my experience. I have moderate hormonal acne resulting in mostly cysts. I have used a variety of prescription and over the counter acne treatments getting results with antibiotics (which ended up damaging my health) and not much else. I settled with using a salycic acid cleanser and benzoyl peroxide with moisturizer twice a day which gave me slightly worse than mild acne. My skin looked dull and dry and I had accepted this was how I was going to look. But I decided to try the problem skin moisturizer on a whim no real reason except looking for better hydration. This stuff feels amazing on my skin cool and soothing. My face started to get dewy again and after 2 jars I was hooked and decided to try the cleanser which I also love it&#x27;s mild and refreshing for my skin compared to harsh chemicals. Now I use the very clear cleanser morning and night the moisturizer morning and night as well as mild astringent to get off ny makeup after cleansing and the spot blemish treatment every other night. My skin is so so much clearer I have no cystic acne except maybe one around my period and the rest of the time I have a few little pimples that go away quickly and I can cobceal. I&#x27;m hoping to get even more clear after I switch to a dermae toner instead of astringent.  I truly gave up and was facing the future as an acne ridden adult but now its manageable and I feel good about myself :) don&#x27;t know if it will work for you but don&#x27;t give up you may find something that does!</li>
    <li> I might be a bit biased as this product is made in my hometown of Simi Valley, CA.  Honestly though for its price the best quality and effective moisturizer.  I use it every night.  I do not recommend using it in the morning as it makes your skin very sensitive to the sun.  I wear sunscreen every day and I still prefer not to put it on in the morning.  Amazon has the best price for 2.  Whole Foods and other distributors charge upwards of $23 for one!</li>
    <li> I use a lot of very drying products on my face and desperately need a moisturizer that will moisturize my skin without making me breakout even more.  This is NOT it.  The cream goes on very thick and does not absorb very well.  It actually makes my face feel even dryer.  It has a very strong tea tree oil smell, which I personally do not like at all.  It probably does help with acne, but I can&#x27;t use it.  Unfortunately it also came as a pack of 2.  I will be selling the un opened jar in the garage sale, and probably end up throwing the opened jar in the trash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using tea tree oil for about 6 months now for acne, which I&#x27;ve had for about 13 years. I read great things about it. I wouldn&#x27;t call it a miracle by any means but it is an anti bacterial and does work. I added tea tree oil to my toner, I apply it directly on spots, and am glad to have found this moisturizer. It smells like teat tree oil (which isn&#x27;t pleasant) so I know there that this moisturizer really is anti blemish and it does work! The smell does go away before you leave the house. I use it over my benzoyl peroxide during the day. I add SPF to it and some drops of vitamin c serum daily to give it added anti aging benefits. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have dealt with cystic acne for 20 years!  I have tried over the counter products, infomercial products and presciptions.  Nothing helped.  While browsing Amazon one day, I came across this product and figured it was pretty inexpensive and had great reviews, so why not try it.  I am soooo glad I did; it is amazing!  I won&#x27;t say it has completely cleared my acne, but a majority of it is gone and when I do have break outs, they are much smaller and clear very quickly.  All of the redness is also gone, my face looks so good!  And that is something I have never said before.  It moisturizes well, works fine under my make up and does a great job of clearing up the acne.  I am also going to order the cleanser that goes along with this moisturizer.  I hope it is just as good.</li>
    <li> Did not work for my sensitive, breakout prone skin. It actually broke me out on my face and neck area.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive, acne prone skin and this stuff has really helped my complexion.  It goes on a little tacky at first, but quickly absorbs into my skin.</li>
    <li> I have had horrible acne for years and I have tried absolutely everything (from medicated acne creams to the drugstore ones) and nothing seemed to be calming it down. I was on antibiotics and birth control but my acne was still rampant! I would baby my skin and not scrub or dry it out too much. I also used a clay mask specifically for acne once a week. I had been searching for a new acne moisturizer a few months ago because my old one had ran out. I love the idea of organic products and paraben free anything so that instantly drew me to derma e! When I bought the moisturizer, I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to dab acne cream on my face before bed but it would never help my clusters of acne. Especially the acne on my cheeks. They would become inflamed in large patches and it would hurt when ever I accidentally touched my face. I never thought it was the acne cream that was causing my skin to be irritated. So when I ran out I had to use my derma e moisturizer to dab on to the problem areas. The night that I did that I woke up with flattened and less inflamed skin. IT WAS A MIRACLE. I almost cried, I was seeing results for the first time in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know we all don&#x27;t have the same skin types so this product may not do the same for you. But honestly just give it a try! :) I am so glad I did! I&#x27;m stocking up on it now! I&#x27;m almost done with my first jar. Anyway, another reason to try is the fact that this product has so many great reviews! Apparently this product is working for alot of different people which is GREAT! :) I&#x27;ve never written a review for anything in my life, but this moisturizer has changed my life. My acne isn&#x27;t 100% clear but let me just tell you that its A LOT better than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved this moisturizer so much that I made my sister try it too! I didn&#x27;t tell her about how it was working for me, I just told her that she should use it. And one say she came up to me and told me that she really loved the moisturizer (her skin is acne prone as well). I also recommended it to my best friend and she has yet to try it, but I bet she&#x27;ll love it as well :)))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review will help those acne sufferers out there! I know how you feel, and honestly I felt so alone. And I also felt like nothing was working or helping. Hope this helps you! &lt;3333</li>
    <li> Have noticed a significant reduction in the oiliness of my skin since starting to use this product. It smells earthy; be warned -- but works very well. And you only need to use a little.</li>
