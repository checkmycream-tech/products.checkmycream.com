      <li>It came on time, wrapped up securely and is even more attractive in person!</li>

      <li>Got this for me but may order some more for friend&#x27;s birthdays.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cute.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been waiting for it about 1 month&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>They arranged to send the compact registered mail and informed me it would take 10-15 days more for delivery (South Korea to the USA).</li>
      <li>More for a child not an item for a woman.</li>
      <li>It is attractive, just not as much as I had hoped.  </li>
      <li>I would have kept looking for a better one to spend money on.</li>
      <li>The compact looks brighter and more detailed in the picture.</li>
      <li>This is truly a unique compact mirror that I just love to show off.</li>
      <li>and it still looks good as new.</li>
      <li>I was super excited!</li>
      <li>I could have found an equally lovely compact elsewhere that would have gotten to me the first time, on time.</li>
      <li>This compact is for our granddaughter who is a very elegant young lady.  </li>
      <li>Also the mirror is smaller than I thought it would be; it is perfectly pocket-sized, just thought it would be slightly larger.  </li>
      <li>There are more flowers that cover up the black and it also doesn&#x27;t look so nice and pearly like it does in the picture.</li>
      <li>but it is worth it.</li>
      <li>The delicate designs in mother-of-pearl are stunningly beautiful.</li>
      <li>This little compact will fit nicely into the tiniest of handbags, and you&#x27;ll never be embarrased to take it out in the finest of restaurants.</li>
      <li>I bought another design first, and once I got it home and saw the colors and the details and the quality, I immediately ordered several more for &amp;#34;girlfriend&amp;#34; gifts.</li>
      <li>It is really pretty though.  </li>
      <li>I like the mirror, its definitely pretty.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really pretty</li>
      <li>lovely, tiny, essential and classy, love it!</li>
      <li>Maybe could be priced a little more competitively but its not bad.</li>
      <li>It was light and smaller than how it it looks in the picture.</li>
      <li>Initially I had some shipping issues when I first tried to purchase this, but the seller did respond relatively quickly and fixed the issue.</li>
      <li>I purchased this for a Christmas gift for my niece who is in high school.  </li>
      <li>The mirror compact is very clear.</li>
      <li>The color of the inlay was vivid.</li>
      <li>no where near in time for Christmas.</li>
      <li>I ended up messaging the maker, Antique Alive, and found out they had already shipped my product.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money.  </li>
      <li>This mirror is sooooooo small and nothing strong about it.  </li>
      <li>This small, very compact mirror was for me very desirable thing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;We were concerned that the hurricane, Sandy, would delay delivery, but were pleasantly surprised to receive it yesterday, several days ahead of the promised delivery date.  </li>
      <li>Pretty but smaller than I expected</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the shipping problems were worth the hassle.</li>

<li> I&#x27;m not sure if the shipping problems were worth the hassle.</li>
<li> First time it was difficult to open mirror.</li>
<li> I bought another compact mirror when I purchased this one and they look almost identical to each other in design; the big difference is the other cost less than $6.</li>
<li> At first it was difficult to open but it just took a little figuring out.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a fairly small compact, I thought it would have been bigger.</li>
<li> Its small a little bigger than a Oreo cookie and very flimsy and thin metal hard to open due to the small metal clasp.</li>
<li> And ur us really hard to open.</li>
<li> I vas very dissappointed when I seen this thin small thing not worth almost $20!</li>
<li> I&#x27;d probably buy again as a gift for somebody if the price was a bit less.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m not sure this is &amp;#34;mother of pearl&amp;#34; vs. just a plastic sticker.  </li>
<li> The metal is thin and the clasp is hard to open because of the poor quality of the metal.  </li>
<li> At least mine doesn&#x27;t.</li>
<li> I really wanted this compact despite being disappointed that my friend was unable to get it for Christmas, maybe I could get it to her before the end of January!</li>
<li> I was a little disappointed when I opened the package</li>
<li> but sadly it didn&#x27;t make it for the end of January either.</li>
<li> :(</li>
<li> /&gt;After I placed my order Dec 9, I noticed it said the item would not arrive before Christmas and gave a delivery window of Jan 4-Jan 24, 2013, which made me very unhappy because it did not say that before I placed the order.  </li>

    <li> I gave this as a gift and my sister loved it. It&#x27;s absolutely beautiful. It&#x27;s been about a year and it still looks good as new.</li>
    <li> Its small a little bigger than a Oreo cookie and very flimsy and thin metal hard to open due to the small metal clasp. I vas very dissappointed when I seen this thin small thing not worth almost $20! the picture is inflated to make it look big  what a rip off!</li>
    <li> This mirror is sooooooo small and nothing strong about it.  Do not waste your money.  It is like a toy.</li>
    <li> lovely, tiny, essential and classy, love it!</li>
    <li> The design on this is gorgeous. I&#x27;ve received so many compliments!</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed when I opened the package the compact came in. The compact looks brighter and more detailed in the picture. If I knew that the compact actually did look the way it does I would have kept looking for a better one to spend money on.</li>
    <li> It does not look the same. There are more flowers that cover up the black and it also doesn&#x27;t look so nice and pearly like it does in the picture. At least mine doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Got this for me but may order some more for friend&#x27;s birthdays.  We never seem to have a compact mirror when needed!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute.  More for a child not an item for a woman.</li>
    <li> This is truly a unique compact mirror that I just love to show off. It&#x27;s a little pricey but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> This small, very compact mirror was for me very desirable thing. I&#x27;ve been waiting for it about 1 month&#x3D;) When I got it, I was so happy. And I&#x27;m still happy. It looks like on the picture. First time it was difficult to open mirror. But after month it opens very easily like it&#x27;s plastic.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for a family member that loves butterflies. It came on time, wrapped up securely and is even more attractive in person! Very pleased with it and would recommend for those that value quality with a great price! 5 STARS!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really pretty but I&#x27;m not sure this is &amp;#34;mother of pearl&amp;#34; vs. just a plastic sticker.  It is really pretty though.  I&#x27;d probably buy again as a gift for somebody if the price was a bit less.  I bought another compact mirror when I purchased this one and they look almost identical to each other in design; the big difference is the other cost less than $6.</li>
    <li> The color of the inlay was vivid. The quality of the compact was very good. The mirror compact is very clear.</li>
    <li> For the money I paid for this it does not meet my expectations. It was light and smaller than how it it looks in the picture. And ur us really hard to open. Don&#x27;t bother</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful piece.  Bought it for my wife.  Looks like it would cost more, very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Initially I had some shipping issues when I first tried to purchase this, but the seller did respond relatively quickly and fixed the issue. I like the mirror, its definitely pretty. Maybe could be priced a little more competitively but its not bad.</li>
    <li> I ordered this in November 2013. I was super excited! I found the perfect gift for my bestie! Then I get an email from Amazon saying that my product would arrive Dec 22-Jan 10th..... that&#x27;s a big gap and no where near in time for Christmas. :( I sucked it up and decided to wait. Finally Jan 10th rolled around and I still had not received my product. I ended up messaging the maker, Antique Alive, and found out they had already shipped my product. The problem with this? It had gotten lost in the mail. They arranged to send the compact registered mail and informed me it would take 10-15 days more for delivery (South Korea to the USA). Again I sucked it up and went on. I really wanted this compact despite being disappointed that my friend was unable to get it for Christmas, maybe I could get it to her before the end of January! 18 days later the compact finally arrived. At first it was difficult to open but it just took a little figuring out. It&#x27;s a fairly small compact, I thought it would have been bigger. It&#x27;s truly a beautiful mirror but sadly it didn&#x27;t make it for the end of January either. Now i&#x27;ll give it as a Valentine. I&#x27;m not sure if the shipping problems were worth the hassle. I could have found an equally lovely compact elsewhere that would have gotten to me the first time, on time. I suppose that&#x27;s what you get when you shop online though....</li>
    <li> The metal is thin and the clasp is hard to open because of the poor quality of the metal.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a Christmas gift for my niece who is in high school.  She loved it.  When my granddaughter&#x27;s saw the compact they each want one.  It is beautiful.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a Christmas present, so I can only comment on my thoughts when I took mirror out of package for inspection.  The mirror is not as beautiful as the pictures make it seem.  It is attractive, just not as much as I had hoped.  Also the mirror is smaller than I thought it would be; it is perfectly pocket-sized, just thought it would be slightly larger.  Cannot comment on durability yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I placed my order Dec 9, I noticed it said the item would not arrive before Christmas and gave a delivery window of Jan 4-Jan 24, 2013, which made me very unhappy because it did not say that before I placed the order.  But I received the item on about Dec. 17 - Yay!  The item comes from Korea, so I guess that explains it, and Amazon is not even showing that I received it yet.</li>
    <li> This compact is for our granddaughter who is a very elegant young lady.  She has always loved playing in my pocketbook, and especially loved my compact.  This year we have bought her a purse along with this compact for her to enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were concerned that the hurricane, Sandy, would delay delivery, but were pleasantly surprised to receive it yesterday, several days ahead of the promised delivery date.  The quality is good.  We would recommend this to our family.</li>
    <li> This little compact will fit nicely into the tiniest of handbags, and you&#x27;ll never be embarrased to take it out in the finest of restaurants. The workmanship and design are exquisite. It&#x27;s a miniature work of art for your purse. The delicate designs in mother-of-pearl are stunningly beautiful. I bought another design first, and once I got it home and saw the colors and the details and the quality, I immediately ordered several more for &amp;#34;girlfriend&amp;#34; gifts. At such an affordable price, it&#x27;s a terrific treat for any woman.  What woman doesn&#x27;t need a purse mirror?  I&#x27;m so delighted with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Pretty but smaller than I expected</li>
