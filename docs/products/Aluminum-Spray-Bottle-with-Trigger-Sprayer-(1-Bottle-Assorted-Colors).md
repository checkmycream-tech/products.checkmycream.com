### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great quality.</li>
      <li>Bottle works great and perfect to fit you hand.</li>
      <li>I was delighted with it for about 2 minutes</li>
      <li>attractive stylish bottle for misting plants or for spray on oils for salad and also to mist kitty to get off table</li>
      <li>The sprayers on the bottles did not work on more than one.  </li>
      <li>You can find better products at the dollar store.</li>
      <li>Filled it up, but it never sprayed.  </li>
      <li>so either way it would be cool.</li>
      <li>The only good thing about this product is that the bottle is aluminum.</li>
      <li>Your better off going to your local hardware shop or mega store or whatever and buy a cheap one.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe that I order stainless steel bottles and the sprayer stopped working after two uses!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Secondly, the sprayer worked LITERALLY the first couple of times I used it to mist my house plants.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted to refill with my Lavender water.  </li>
      <li>Would not want have wanted bright blue or red in my home.  </li>
      <li>Very pretty and sturdy bottle, but unfortuately it does not spray more than once when used with WD-40, probably due to the oily make of the product.</li>
      <li>I intended to use this to spray extra light olive oil.  </li>
      <li>Now it sprays out at 90 degree angles, instead of straight out</li>
      <li>MUCH.  </li>
      <li>But since it&#x27;s plastic and I&#x27;m trying to avoid plastic, I figured this would be a nice heavy duty replacement.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a decent looking spray bottle to have around where clients see it..</li>
      <li>you are thinking about buying this, I HIGHLY DISCOURAGE YOU to buy this.</li>
      <li>Don’t waste funds on this cheap product.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works exactly as expected</li>
    <li> Got these at the local dollar store.  Save your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clogged with water.  Clogged with vinegar.  Clogged with oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most number of sprays before clogging, 14 for the water.</li>
    <li> I intended to use this to spray extra light olive oil.  Filled it up, but it never sprayed.  Not recommended.</li>
    <li> The sprayers on the bottles did not work on more than one.  Two of the bottles were dented.  Was not satisfied with the quality of the bottles.</li>
    <li> The only good thing about this product is that the bottle is aluminum. That&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I realize we can&#x27;t choose the color on this item but the pic clearly shows silver, red and blue; with a vague descriptions that says \\&quot;assorted colors\\&quot;... I figured I would get one of those colors so either way it would be cool. Tell me why I receive a freakin pink bottle? Yes PINK. Nothing wrong with pink, but as a dude I might have preferred a different color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the sprayer worked LITERALLY the first couple of times I used it to mist my house plants. Now it sprays out at 90 degree angles, instead of straight out like it&#x27;s supposed to. Even when I open up the nozzle to spray a stream it comes out crooked. Or I&#x27;ll have mist out of one side and stream from the other half. What a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought a cheapo $1 spray bottle from Walgreens years ago and it still works. But since it&#x27;s plastic and I&#x27;m trying to avoid plastic, I figured this would be a nice heavy duty replacement. Oh how I was mistaken. I feel taken advantage of considering this thing cost me $5.73!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking about buying this, I HIGHLY DISCOURAGE YOU to buy this. Your better off going to your local hardware shop or mega store or whatever and buy a cheap one. And by the way, shipping from NC to AZ took forever. I think it was the seller who didn&#x27;t ship it until 4 or 5 days after I paid for it.</li>
    <li> 2 of three have broken so far with very minimal use in the first few days! Don&#x27;t buy. This product is crap!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re pretty useless.  They have a very difficult time standing up.  The product came with a sticker on the entire bottom that wrapped up the sides and it was a pain to remove.  If you&#x27;re looking for a decent looking spray bottle to have around where clients see it.. this is not the one for you.  Search around and find something else.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THEM FOR FOOD USE.  I BELIEVE I&#x27;LL USE LESS OF A THING IF I SPRAY IT INSTEAD OF POUR IT.  THANX MUCH.  C</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted to refill with my Lavender water.  They sent the silver which is what I wanted but I wish they gave you a choice.  Would not want have wanted bright blue or red in my home.  Bottle works great and perfect to fit you hand. Great quality.</li>
    <li> How can you screw up a spray bottle?  These guys know how.  It arrived a couple days ago and the trigger sticks in the full pulled position, absolutely worthless.  Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> I purchased the spray bottle and used it for one week sporadically.  The spray trigger is already broken.  Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> attractive stylish bottle for misting plants or for spray on oils for salad and also to mist kitty to get off table</li>
    <li> Very pretty and sturdy bottle, but unfortuately it does not spray more than once when used with WD-40, probably due to the oily make of the product. Not the bottles fault.</li>
    <li> WAS NOT PLEASE WITH THESE BOTTLES AND RETURNED THEM. ALL HAD DEFECTS THAT PREVENTED SPRAYING. GUESS THAT&#x27;S WHY WE SHOULD BUY MADE IN THE USA</li>
    <li> You can find better products at the dollar store. The sprayer is worthless, it broke the second time it was used.</li>
    <li> i bought 2 of these. 1 for each of my 2 daughters. both were broken after approx 1 month of use. crap.</li>
    <li> Never worked from the get go. It appears the seal is too small to maintain pressure. Bought despite the bad reviews because it was so cheap. I hope I have finally learned my lesson and stay away from crap like this.</li>
    <li> The header was broken when we used it at first time. I think the reason is the header is made by plastic?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks. The spray trigger is already broken. I&#x27;m buying a different one today. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this spray bottle a handful of time and it broke. Very poorly kept together. Don’t waste funds on this cheap product. EXTREMELY UNSATTISFIED!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I order stainless steel bottles and the sprayer stopped working after two uses! I am very disappointed and will see if they will send me some more replacements</li>
    <li> Very irritating.  I was delighted with it for about 2 minutes - now it doesn&#x27;t work at all... Even it it DID actually function , it falls over all the time.  Save your $.</li>
    <li> Returned, arrived broke.</li>
