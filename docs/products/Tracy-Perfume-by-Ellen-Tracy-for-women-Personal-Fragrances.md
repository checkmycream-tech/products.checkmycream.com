      <li>now it may smell better on another person</li>
      <li>I love love love this scent</li>
      <li>I love this perfume.  </li>
      <li>I got so many compliments and people asking me what perfume I was wearing.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite perfume</li>
      <li>I just make sure I keep it upright at all times.</li>
      <li>FABULOUS scent!</li>
      <li>The scent is OK.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell but wished it lasted longer.</li>
      <li>considering the price I paid for this and the lasting beautiful scent, It is the number one best purchase I have made thus far.</li>
      <li>I love Ellen Tracy, and this company did not send me a old bottle, so the smell is still great.</li>
      <li>This perfume is light and perfect for daily wear.  </li>
      <li>But I think there are much better scents available at this price point.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased and will be ordering some more real soon...</li>
      <li>, I told her the important is that she liked very much the smell of the fragance!</li>
      <li>Smells really nice, light and fresh.</li>
      <li>too strong for my skin.</li>
      <li>This scent is perfect for the day and I am delighted with how long lasting it is.  </li>
      <li>ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE FRESH AND LIGHT SCENT</li>
      <li>The smell and price is great, but it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
      <li>But it was just as suttle &amp; lightly floral as I remembered it.</li>
      <li>Smells nice, but I bought it for a gift, so I can&#x27;t really appraise it.</li>
      <li>So many fragrances have a certain heaviness that stays with you, making you wonder if everyone else in the room thinks you&#x27;ve overdone it....but not this perfume!  </li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t smell like the original one i bought from the store.</li>
      <li>Still enjoy the fresh, light scent-never overpowering and will still,on occasion, have people pass by and comment \\&quot;you smell good\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>- I have a more acidic body chemistry and this smells very clean and soft.  </li>
      <li>Loved this scent from my earlier purchase at another location.</li>
      <li>A fresh light scent</li>
      <li>it has a clean and subtle scent, which is perfect for the office or to be used every day!</li>
      <li>Getting ready to purchase another bottle!!</li>
      <li>Very mild scent --- good for everyday wear!&lt;br /&gt;Light floral, oil based, non-intrusive scent.</li>
      <li>I was happy with the condition and amount of time it took to receive this product, however the scent is not as strong as the same product that had been purchased in a local dept.</li>
      <li>it is more soft and maybe a powdery.</li>
      <li>The cost is so worth it.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend and I went to a baseball game after work and it was just perfect there too -</li>
      <li>and the price is right, will purchase again,</li>
      <li>When I opened the box I smelled it right away</li>
      <li>The price was reasonable and it was delivered quickly.</li>
      <li>I love the cologne, but I having problems with the sprayer it&#x27;s not working properly, it&#x27;s spilling out from the sprayer.  </li>
      <li>I first received this fragrance as a gift.  </li>
      <li>this is the second time I am ordering it and will be buy it again and again and have introduce it to my friends and they love the smell.</li>
      <li>My husband loved it on me, as he does not care for heavy perfume.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m really the only one enjoying it at bedtime..</li>
      <li>and I have found it and at a reasonable price with very fast delivery.</li>
      <li>thanks &#x3D;3</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>My mom really likes it, but she never heard before about Ellen Tracy</li>
      <li>I have a number of designer, heavier fragrances, but I use those for special occasions only.</li>
      <li>It is light and the scent lasts for a long time.. even on the driest of skin.</li>
      <li>Luckily got the smaller bottle.</li>
      <li>However i went with this purchase because i tried other Ellen Tracy perfume earlier and liked it.</li>
      <li>receive daily compliments at work and customers remember me by it for long time (\\&quot;I remember you, you smell so good...\\&quot;), mild scent, long lasting, changes a little but remains very pleasant.</li>
      <li>I am not one for flowery perfumes, but this one is very different - the lower sandalwood, musk notes blend the beginning flower notes you first smell</li>
      <li>with all my year round allergies i have a VERY hard time handling any kind of perfume/scented body lotions, but this soft feminine scent is just right all year round.</li>

    <li> Smells nice, but I bought it for a gift, so I can&#x27;t really appraise it.</li>
    <li> ...and the price is right, will purchase again, is now my signature scent.  Bought for myself and as a gift to family members.</li>
    <li> Glad I purchased this perfume.  Smells really nice, light and fresh. Getting lots of compliments.  Bought it through a friend&#x27;s recommendation.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the perfume.</li>
    <li> After receiving this parfume I did not like the smell of it on me....now it may smell better on another person but I didn&#x27;t care for it.  It was packaged nicely and it has a nice bottle and it is what it is.</li>
    <li> I was happy with the condition and amount of time it took to receive this product, however the scent is not as strong as the same product that had been purchased in a local dept. store.[[ASIN:B000P250ZI Tracy By Ellen Tracy For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 2.5 oz]]</li>
    <li> I love the cologne, but I having problems with the sprayer it&#x27;s not working properly, it&#x27;s spilling out from the sprayer.  What do I do??</li>
    <li> FABULOUS scent! with all my year round allergies i have a VERY hard time handling any kind of perfume/scented body lotions, but this soft feminine scent is just right all year round. i do have other perfumes i like but i always go back to \\&quot;tracy\\&quot;. thanks &#x3D;3</li>
    <li> I love love love this scent but it has no lasting power. So I&#x27;m really the only one enjoying it at bedtime..me and hubby</li>
    <li> Smells great, and the price is great.  Getting ready to purchase another bottle!!</li>
    <li> This scent is perfect for the day and I am delighted with how long lasting it is.  I am not one for flowery perfumes, but this one is very different - the lower sandalwood, musk notes blend the beginning flower notes you first smell - I have a more acidic body chemistry and this smells very clean and soft.  When you move around there is a whiff of it in the air; not at all overpowering.  My boyfriend and I went to a baseball game after work and it was just perfect there too - I got so many compliments and people asking me what perfume I was wearing.</li>
    <li> This is my go to fragrance! Lots of compliments always.</li>
    <li> it smells good, but it burns my skin. too strong for my skin. I need a different type of perfume.</li>
    <li> This perfume is light and perfect for daily wear.  So many fragrances have a certain heaviness that stays with you, making you wonder if everyone else in the room thinks you&#x27;ve overdone it....but not this perfume!  A fresh light scent and you&#x27;re good to go.  The price was reasonable and it was delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> She really liked, and loved the smell, defenelly is for adoult women after 30 years. My mom really likes it, but she never heard before about Ellen Tracy, I told her the important is that she liked very much the smell of the fragance! Recommend it!</li>
    <li> Smell really good. I like.</li>
    <li> Excellent Perfume Love It!</li>
    <li> Nice Fragrance, Great gifts for the Ladies, they Love it,</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like the ones that I purchased at stores. To me definitively is not the same...It doesn&#x27;t last and the scent is completely different. I feel sorry, because I can&#x27;t find it anymore at the regular stores where I&#x27;ve found it before. No STARS!</li>
    <li> I love Ellen Tracy, and this company did not send me a old bottle, so the smell is still great. Alot of compliments, I get.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  Its scent is so delicate and understated.  I get compliments all the time.  I even recommended it to a friend whose picky husband was put-off by everything else she tried.  He loved Tracy.  One bottle lasts a long time, too. Added bonus!</li>
    <li> I just love this &amp;#34;Tracy&amp;#34;. It is light and the scent lasts for a long time.. even on the driest of skin. The cost is so worth it. In my opinion the smell is... not flowery it is more soft and maybe a powdery. Everyone always asks the name of it and when I tell them... they say they never heard of it let alone Ellen Tracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> Very mild scent --- good for everyday wear!&lt;br /&gt;Light floral, oil based, non-intrusive scent. I like it! I&#x27;ve used it often since acquiring it from Anazon!</li>
    <li> receive daily compliments at work and customers remember me by it for long time (\\&quot;I remember you, you smell so good...\\&quot;), mild scent, long lasting, changes a little but remains very pleasant. Purchased 3 bottles this year, very happy with shipping and price.</li>
    <li> This is the one of the 5 random perfumes purchased in amazon for gifting purpose. Its pretty difficult to buy perfumes that you haven&#x27;t tried earlier, just by looking at description and reviews. However i went with this purchase because i tried other Ellen Tracy perfume earlier and liked it. However, with this bottle, had to literally pour extra and dig in the nose to get the smell. Not sure if it is watered down or what. Hoping it would get better with time, tried again later to see if the smell grows but alas no luck! Luckily got the smaller bottle. Will not get it again.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell like the original one i bought from the store.</li>
    <li> considering the price I paid for this and the lasting beautiful scent, It is the number one best purchase I have made thus far. ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE FRESH AND LIGHT SCENT, this will be my go to for summer.</li>
    <li> I have searched all over for this perfume but could not find it in any stores. I finally decided to try online and I am so very glad I did. This is my favorite perfume and I have found it and at a reasonable price with very fast delivery. I am very pleased and will be ordering some more real soon...Thank you</li>
    <li> This is my every day go-to fragrance for several years now! I have a number of designer, heavier fragrances, but I use those for special occasions only. This one - it has a clean and subtle scent, which is perfect for the office or to be used every day! And most importantly for me, it smells just as nice at the end of the day! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume it always comes on time!</li>
    <li> The smell and price is great, but it doesn&#x27;t last. It also came a bit leaky. When I opened the box I smelled it right away b/c it was kind of leaking. I just make sure I keep it upright at all times. I love the smell but wished it lasted longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn Tracy for years and I&#x27;m glad I can still find it.  It&#x27;s my everyday fragrance and so inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne. I gave two away as gifts. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this Tracy fragrance for several years now.  Still enjoy the fresh, light scent-never overpowering and will still,on occasion, have people pass by and comment \\&quot;you smell good\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Love the price and would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Great cologne LOVE IT!!!! this is the second time I am ordering it and will be buy it again and again and have introduce it to my friends and they love the smell.</li>
    <li> I first received this fragrance as a gift.  I instantly adored it and now has been my go to fragrance for about 7 years.  I always get compliments and asked what I&#x27;m wearing when I have this on.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased Ellen Tracy Eau De Parfum Spray, This is so discounted from what I previously paid in a Belk&#x27;s store, which was $62.00. From this reduced priced one might think it&#x27;s a knock off. But it was just as suttle &amp; lightly floral as I remembered it. My husband loved it on me, as he does not care for heavy perfume.</li>
    <li> The scent is OK.  But I think there are much better scents available at this price point.</li>
    <li> Loved this scent from my earlier purchase at another location. This purchase didn&#x27;t smell the same, somewhat stronger. Didn&#x27;t care for it as well.</li>
    <li> A co-worker asked me to order this, I bought a second bottle for my wife. Great price for product you would pay much more for at Department Stores.</li>
