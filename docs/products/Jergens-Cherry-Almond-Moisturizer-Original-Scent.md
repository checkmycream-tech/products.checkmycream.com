      <li>It smells great and keeps my skin fresh and smooth.</li>
      <li>Jergens, WHY did you change such a wonderful lotion???</li>
      <li>I love this jergens brand lotion....</li>
      <li>I tend to be quite frugal and Jergens is a great value as it really works.</li>
      <li>Original scent, my hind leg!</li>
      <li>Smells delicious and works well for dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell of original Jergens lotion.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t think I could find the original scent anymore (as is case with most brands of items).</li>
      <li>The consistency is light enough to be easily spreadable, but incredibly softening.</li>
      <li>The smell is so refreshing and clean.  </li>
      <li>I strongly recommend</li>
      <li>Very good lotion, much better than other brands.  </li>
      <li>Nice and smooth, smells quite nice, thought it would smell a little nicer, but still a good product.</li>
      <li>Appreciated a smooth easy transaction plus fast shipping with this GREAT Seller.</li>
      <li>This is as great now as it was 40 years ago..same scent and quality, it was the only lotion my mom would use...</li>
      <li>I was surprised by the smell but really loved it.</li>
      <li>she has been gone many years but each time I use  this, it floods me with her memory.....such a refreshing scent, and really soothes the skin , hope they keep making it.....</li>
      <li>But found it and in this easy pump applicator, packed two to a pack with a special price.</li>
      <li>I use the ultra healing all over after my bath and keep the original scent by the bed</li>
      <li>Though this lotion was advertised and the bottle shown in the picture as the original lotion, it is not.  </li>
      <li>But, GIRLS, it is the same ORIGINAL scent that we have always loved and can&#x27;t find anymore.  </li>
      <li>Love the almond cherry scent and it really softens my hands and skin without being greasy.</li>
      <li>My heels are soft and lovely afterwards.</li>
      <li>worth for money.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says and I like the new formula even better.</li>
      <li>I have loved this lotion since I was a little kid - 30-ish years ago.  </li>
      <li>I actually like Target&#x27;s brand that compares to vaseline better than this product.  </li>
      <li>The scent is addicting as well ;D</li>
      <li>Product as described; fast shipping!</li>
      <li>so I bought it on here and its exactly what i was looking for</li>
      <li>, this is okay, but it seems more ordinary.</li>
      <li>Further, the lotion back then was silkier and absorbed into your skin really nice</li>
      <li>very well moisturizing</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
      <li>i love this over any other moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Please bring back the original lotion.</li>
      <li>I ordered several bottles of this because the picture showed the original bottle, not the new &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; formula.</li>
      <li>I cannot use the new formula, it bothers my skin.  </li>
      <li>Now I have bottles all over my house and every time i use it I have a quick flash back to that kitchen in Teaneck, NJ with red counter</li>
      <li>I wish they had a &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; level lotion that uses their old formula, or something closer to that experience.</li>
      <li>it keeps my skin soft.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin soft and moisturized all day.  </li>
      <li>I always had to watch using any of the over counter moisturizers, as sensitive to scents they have.</li>
      <li>The new lotion is too greasy, and that heavenly scent is almost, but not quite, the same.</li>
      <li>I first tried Jergens lotion when I was a little girl visiting my Godmother&#x27;s house.</li>

    <li> Nice and smooth, smells quite nice, thought it would smell a little nicer, but still a good product. Thank you</li>
    <li> I use a TON of moisturizer, and this is still the best I&#x27;ve tried. The consistency is light enough to be easily spreadable, but incredibly softening. The scent is addicting as well ;D</li>
    <li> Love the smell of original Jergens lotion.  This is a great value.  Excellent moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed. I ordered several bottles of this because the picture showed the original bottle, not the new &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; formula. Jergens, WHY did you change such a wonderful lotion??? The new lotion is too greasy, and that heavenly scent is almost, but not quite, the same. Please bring back the original lotion.</li>
    <li> I have tried just about every body lotion known to women! Jergen&#x27;s Original Scent is the perfect blend of scent and moisture...I would be lost without it!!!</li>
    <li> For some reason I can&#x27;t find this scent in stores so I bought it on here and its exactly what i was looking for</li>
    <li> Though this lotion was advertised and the bottle shown in the picture as the original lotion, it is not.  It is the &amp;#34;original scent&amp;#34; but, the changed formula in the beige, not white bottle.  I cannot use the new formula, it bothers my skin.  I was highly disappointed, however, I did receive my money back with no problem.</li>
    <li> i love this over any other moisturizer. it keeps my skin soft. worth for money. i would recommend this .</li>
    <li> I have loved this lotion since I was a little kid - 30-ish years ago.  I thought of it as perfume then.  And since I&#x27;m allergic to most perfumes and this doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies, I still think of it as my favorite perfume.  Besides the wonderful cherry/almond scent, this works very well moisturizing my dry elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Original scent, my hind leg! It stinks to high heaven. Like original scent only nasty! Like it&#x27;s on steroids or something. Even after I washed my hands it was still too strong!</li>
    <li> Very good love the scent.Keeps my skin moist</li>
    <li> I first tried Jergens lotion when I was a little girl visiting my Godmother&#x27;s house. I was surprised by the smell but really loved it. Now I have bottles all over my house and every time i use it I have a quick flash back to that kitchen in Teaneck, NJ with red counter tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep this pump bottle by the kitchen sink and it has kept my hands and cuticles soft during this very cold and dry Chicago winter. I tend to be quite frugal and Jergens is a great value as it really works.</li>
    <li> I was almost thrown off by the \\&quot;unisex\\&quot; in the ad for this lotion. But, GIRLS, it is the same ORIGINAL scent that we have always loved and can&#x27;t find anymore.  I wish it came in the 32 oz bottles like the ultra healing or that they would put this scent in the ultra healing lotion.  I treated myself to both and am very happy. I use the ultra healing all over after my bath and keep the original scent by the bed so I can slather on my hands and arms before I go to bed. All of this lotion is an excellent buy and wonderful moisturizer. Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> I actually like Target&#x27;s brand that compares to vaseline better than this product.  This lotion will make due for now</li>
    <li> Jergens is a great brand and this lotion is fantastic. It smells great and keeps my skin fresh and smooth. Completely satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Love the pump and keep it by my kitchen sink so I am always reminded to moisturize my hands, especially after doing the  dishes! Love the almond cherry scent and it really softens my hands and skin without being greasy.</li>
    <li> This is as great now as it was 40 years ago..same scent and quality, it was the only lotion my mom would use...she has been gone many years but each time I use  this, it floods me with her memory.....such a refreshing scent, and really soothes the skin , hope they keep making it.....</li>
    <li> Very good lotion, much better than other brands.  Stills on without feeling greasy.  Great for the winter for keeping yourself moisturized.</li>
    <li> I love this jergens brand lotion.... The smell is so refreshing and clean.  The lotion stays on for a long time.  worth buying!!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great for me. I always had to watch using any of the over counter moisturizers, as sensitive to scents they have. My eyes would water if touching my face after applying. Received a travel size from a friend, and found it doesn&#x27;t do that to me. Didn&#x27;t think I could find the original scent anymore (as is case with most brands of items). But found it and in this easy pump applicator, packed two to a pack with a special price. Will definitely buy again when out. Oh, it moisturizes great too!</li>
    <li> My mom used to use this lotion when I was growing up and I loved the scent and this is close, but it&#x27;s not as rich. Further, the lotion back then was silkier and absorbed into your skin really nice, this is okay, but it seems more ordinary. I wish they had a &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; level lotion that uses their old formula, or something closer to that experience.</li>
    <li> Have loved Jergens since I was a kid.  Smells delicious and works well for dry skin.  Have several spots around the house so it can be used whenever needed.  Everybody who uses it in extra bathroom comments on how nice it feels and how wonderful it smells.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Appreciated a smooth easy transaction plus fast shipping with this GREAT Seller. Ever since I can remember I&#x27;ve use Jergen&#x27;s skin moisturizer to soften my skin. The fresh cherry-almond scent is delightful as the moisturizer comforts and nourishes. As I share this wonderful product with each generation I&#x27;m happy to know it works but also that it&#x27;s dermatologist tested for safe and effective use.</li>
    <li> Product as described; fast shipping!</li>
    <li> My son loves this lotion and he is ashy no more....lol. my kids with ezcema can&#x27;t use it how ever bc it makes their akin feel like its burning sometimes.</li>
    <li> i am the third generation to use jerkins. I love the cherry almond scent and the way my skin feels for hours. It does exactly what it says and I like the new formula even better. I have rough dry heels and I put the lotion on after my shower and cover with socks. My heels are soft and lovely afterwards. I strongly recommend</li>
    <li> Smells great and moisturizes my skin for a good price! I would recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used other types of lotions/moisturizers before and this is definitely the best.</li>
    <li> Great for the whole family!  This is a very good lotion. It absorbs well and smell absolutely amazing! It leaves my skin soft and moisturized all day.  I love it!</li>
