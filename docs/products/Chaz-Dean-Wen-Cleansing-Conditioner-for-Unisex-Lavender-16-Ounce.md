<li> I was certain my hair was going to be greasy when it dried.</li>

<li> It was very odd, because in reading all the reviews, if I ignored the ones complaining about the price (duh, you knew it wasn&#x27;t cheap when you ordered it)</li>
<li> I have long hair, and in camp, we get 40 liters of water in a shower....</li>
<li> You can not tell that you go so long in between washing.  </li>
<li> I have curly hair that I air dry - this product has made my hair a strange combination of oily and dry/frizzy.  </li>
<li> I currently use just the cleanser &amp; heat protectant styling creme, but I plan on trying some of their other products.</li>
<li> I also don&#x27;t have to shampoo as often so a bottle lasts me longer than I expected.</li>
<li> Does not really smell like lavender.  </li>
<li> First I knew something was wrong when this cleansing conditioner wasn&#x27;t sealed.</li>
<li> I use this product every other day and my hair responds well to it.   </li>
<li> It weighed my hair down.</li>
<li> I have to change my 5 star review down to 1.</li>
<li> It does not weigh it down</li>
<li> My hair was dry &amp; dull.</li>
<li> I use it everyday, one pump and run it through my hair.  </li>
<li> (it&#x27;s not cheap).  </li>
<li> I bought a few bottles to see if this worked..waste of money!</li>
<li> but that is where the similarities end compared to the legit Wen that I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
<li> It made my hair feel very heavy and oily.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have one complaint.</li>
<li> This bottle did not have the thick consistancy.</li>
<li> No fly aways.&lt;br</li>
<li> Needless to say I have stopped using this.  </li>
<li> Sorry I purchased.</li>
<li> I fail to see the appeal</li>
<li> Silly me.  </li>
<li> I was skeptical but decided to give Wen a try.</li>
<li> /&gt;WAYYYYY too expensive!</li>
<li> It felt very weird washing my hair with something that didn&#x27;t lather.</li>
<li> I was very wrong.</li>
<li> I was really disappointed that this could be what has caused all my hair loss as I have no hair to spare.  </li>
<li> I found people reallyloved Wen or they hated it because their hair was falling out.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed.</li>
<li> I had a terrible break out of my Dermatitis Herpetiformis.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My hair feels more hydrated than with my regular shampoos</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t go on safari without it....I have long hair, and in camp, we get 40 liters of water in a shower....even if it&#x27;s not all washed out it still makes my hair look great!</li>
    <li> I love to use Wen as a leave in conditioner.  I use it everyday, one pump and run it through my hair.  It gives it great body and makes it really soft!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT !  I LOVE the &amp;#34;WEN FOR PETS&amp;#34; even more.  Worth every penny (it&#x27;s not cheap).  My dog (doberman) was allergic to all dog shampoos, he would itch for weeks after a bath, had flakey skin, and would shed enough hair for another dog every day, now he is shinny and he doesn&#x27;t shed much at all.  200% happy with Wen for Pets.</li>
    <li> love it!! feel fresh and clean</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen for a while now, so I decided to try purchasing the product from amazon. First I knew something was wrong when this cleansing conditioner wasn&#x27;t sealed. Every legit bottle of Wen i&#x27;ve ever purchased directly from Wen has been sealed. This product does smell amazing... but that is where the similarities end compared to the legit Wen that I&#x27;ve used in the past. This bottle did not have the thick consistancy. It weighed my hair down. It is not even remotly up to par, and you couldn&#x27;t pay me to use the product that this mercahent is selling.</li>
    <li> Wen as a product is wonderful.  I loved how my hair felt.  You can not tell that you go so long in between washing.  I used the orginal formula and then got the Lavender for my second bottle.  I had a terrible break out of my Dermatitis Herpetiformis.  Could not find the source until I tracked this to be the only change.  The lavender formula has gluten in it.  Silly me.  I usually never not read labels and this is what happens when I don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Love Wen products. I can&#x27;t see using anything but Wen!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s odd that it does not lather, but once I was over that, I love how clean my hair is.  This Lavender formula is perfect for my thin fine German/English hair.  It does not weigh it down and I don&#x27;t have to buy conditioner!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it! He has longish curly hair and it is the only shampoo that doesn&#x27;t over dry it and cause it to frizz. :-)</li>
    <li> I did not like this product. It made my hair feel very heavy and oily. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Both my wife &amp; I use this product on a daily basis and our hair has ever been the better for it.  No build up, no fly-away.  Gentle scent and gentle on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WAYYYYY too expensive!</li>
    <li> My wife loves her Wen. I fail to see the appeal but she swears by it. She likes the lavendar scent the best.</li>
    <li> I only use Wen on my hair and have since 2011. It would be hard to pick a favorite, but Lavender is the best scent to have lingering in your hair for the day...or night for that matter.</li>
    <li> No this item ended up blistering my face.</li>
    <li> This is the best way to shampoo your hair.</li>
    <li> It cleans my hair, but I can&#x27;t tell a difference between how my hair responds to this versus a shampoo (any shampoo), so I won&#x27;t be spending that exorbitant sum to buy it again.</li>
    <li> Arrived early and is a great product.</li>
    <li> I have fine thin hair.  I use this product every other day and my hair responds well to it.   Here is the problem.  I&#x27;ve been losing a ton of hair and I just couldn&#x27;t figure out why.  I eat well, exercise, use good product on my skin and hair.  My hairdresser recommended biotin supplements because she couldn&#x27;t figure it out either.  I&#x27;m very easy on my hair.  I don&#x27;t use irons on it and rarely blow dry it so I was stumped.  Then I recently saw on the news that a potential side effect of this product can be hair loss.  I hadn&#x27;t seen that written anywhere and I thought this product was supposed to be good for the hair.  Needless to say I have stopped using this.  I was really disappointed that this could be what has caused all my hair loss as I have no hair to spare.  I just pray this hasn&#x27;t done any permanent damage and that all my hair will grow back now that I have stopped using it.  I would not recommend anyone use this product.</li>
    <li> NOT FOR CURLY HAIR.  Made my hair greasy/oily.  Does not really smell like lavender.  If you blow out your hair often, this might be an ok product for you.  I have curly hair that I air dry - this product has made my hair a strange combination of oily and dry/frizzy.  Sorry I purchased.</li>
    <li> I love that my hair has body. No fly aways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine hair with no body at all. This makes a difference.</li>
    <li> Hair did not lather well and never felt clean!</li>
    <li> I love this!  The smell is wonderful and my hair looks great when I use it:)</li>
    <li> Totally love Wen products.</li>
    <li> Lavender smellis a little strong</li>
    <li> Too much money... Didn&#x27;t work as it described.. I bought a few bottles to see if this worked..waste of money!</li>
    <li> Wen haircare products are amazing! My hair is very fine. I have it colored regularly and I use a blow dryer and flat iron. My hair was dry &amp; dull. I was constantly battling fly aways. I tried several salon brands. Besides shampoo &amp; conditioner I used serums, moisture treatments, heat/styling protectants, etc... Nothing made a difference.  I was skeptical but decided to give Wen a try. It felt very weird washing my hair with something that didn&#x27;t lather. I was certain my hair was going to be greasy when it dried. I was very wrong. My hair looked great! After a couple of weeks it looked healthier than it had in years!  I was totally amazed! I also don&#x27;t have to shampoo as often so a bottle lasts me longer than I expected. I don&#x27;t have one complaint. Except for the customer service. The first time I purchased it over the phone during one of the infomercials. I was told I didn&#x27;t have to do the auto-ship, so imagine my surprise when I received my second shipment. Then it took another shipment and 4 phone calls to get them to cancel it. I will only purchase through Amazon now. I currently use just the cleanser &amp; heat protectant styling creme, but I plan on trying some of their other products. I&#x27;ll be sure to review them as well.  I have to change my 5 star review down to 1. Wen products made my hair fall out. I began losing a noticeable amount of hair. I have fine, flat hair so can&#x27;t afford to lose any. When it started coming out I got worried. Went to my doctor. He tested my thyroid &amp; Whecked for any vitamin deficiencies that could be the cause.  Then one day I was reading customer reviews for Wen. There were tons of people saying it caused their hair to start falling out.  After reading reviews from many different sites I decided to stop using it.  A couple of weeks later the hair loss stopped.  It was very odd, because in reading all the reviews, if I ignored the ones complaining about the price (duh, you knew it wasn&#x27;t cheap when you ordered it) I found people reallyloved Wen or they hated it because their hair was falling out. I&#x27;m not saying don&#x27;t try Wen products.  Many people did fine with them. I&#x27;m just saying if you do, watch for hair loss.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!  I highly recommend it :)</li>
