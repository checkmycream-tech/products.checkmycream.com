<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is the best Minoxidil I have used so far. I have used PiloGro &amp;TuGain in the past but never satisfied with the result and they made me feel dizzy and caused uncomfortable headaches. I had an assumption that all minoxydil will have this side effect until I try Kirkland Minoxidil 5%.  Its easy to apply with the tube they provide with the package. It gives good result for me and especially for my friend who is in the initial stage of hair fall. The result is better when you use it with dermaroller. Please refer to the right size of dermaroller and guideline before you use it.  Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with this product and I bought on for my brother as well. If you found my review helpful, please click the yes button below.</li>
    <li> Good product. Does help with baldness. Check prices on ebay etc.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and performed how described. You need to use this product for a full year before evaluating effectiveness. At this price you can&#x27;t afford not to try and grow more hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this product is fake. I used it for 2 months after switching from a more expensive product. My hair started to fall out in clumps and my scalp became insanely itchy. I threw the stuff away and bought a bottle from a drug store. The hair stopped falling and the itch went away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a female with very fine hair and thought it was getting thinner so gave this a try. 3 weeks in and my hair is THINNER, with wee bald patches..is this normal? Is it the shedding you read sbout? If so how long does that go on for??</li>
    <li> I had too bald spots from Alopecia (that I could cover with hair, but were pretty big). I tried biotin for a month and the rest of my hair grew super thick, but nothing in those areas. I bought some minoxdil and after about a months use the spot on the top of my head is almost 70% grown back (with thick long dark hairs) and The one towards the back is coming along well to.&lt;br /&gt;After the first 2-3 weeks their were a lot of hairs that came in white. They darkened once they got a little longer. I think stress was the cause of my alopecia, so I don&#x27;t no if this will work well if you are balding, but since the rest of my hair is still really thick this helped regrow the lost hairs pretty great. Cheap price too definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> grows hair. I use minoxidil more than 5% with Finasteride and Nizoral 2% shampoo. I am norwood 5A and been using Minoxidil for 4 mos now. lots of vellus hair growing by using these big 3 they call it. (big 3 &#x3D; Nizoral 2%, Finasteride 1.25mg and Minoxidil)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it will grow hair on slick bald/ shiny bald head. Ive read there should be a vellus hair left in order for minoxidil to work on.</li>
    <li> The Minoxidil, which is said to be the same solution that Avacore has used appears to work... I wish I had done a little more research on it 3 years ago when i paid over 10 times the money for the Avacore.</li>
    <li> I am a 25 year old male with early stages of balding. I am between a type 1 and type 2 male pattern balding by norwood classification. Basicly that means i have frontal hair recession. I started using the chemical three months ago. Once in the morning, once at night. Results did not really show until a couple weeks ago. I&#x27;d say my hair in those frontal side areas have improved about 30%. Im excited to see if it will even get better. If not, well..i&#x27;m somewhat satisfied.    DONT USE TOO MUCH in the morning. Go easy on it in the morning because IT WILL GIVE you that flat look that others have stated and it will look even worse.    Drop a little on the areas, and rub in the chemical.    Recently we had a family reunion. and my family definitly all said that yes..my hair has grown in those areas since they last saw me.     So its real folks.     The hair growth starts out as small brittle hairs and then grow into strong ones over time.     BE PATIENT.</li>
    <li> Good product - takes @2-3 months to start working and show a difference. Packed and shipped well. Product as advertised.</li>
    <li> I am in my early 20s and experiencing hair loss. This product started growing new hair within the 1st month. Overall regrowth was outstanding. I regrew about 2cm on my scalp near the middle of my head and grew about 1/2cm from just about my forehead. There hasn&#x27;t been any new growth since(probably just genetics) but I&#x27;m glad that I have regained the surprising amount that I have. I highly recommend this for anyone who, like me, is unfortunately experiencing hair loss as a young age and is self-conscious about losing it. I was depressed for a long time about it (once a few people pointed it out). Thanks to this (inexpensive) product, I am starting to feel my age again! :-)</li>
    <li> I am ordering another 6-month supply because it works for me. Hair has noticeably regrown on all treated areas - front, top, and crown. I am five months into daily usage and continue to see improvement. My youthful mane has not returned but the thin spots are filling in. Don&#x27;t expect a miracle and have patience. Within two weeks my wife and I noticed thickening of the few remaining hairs and small peach fuzz like hairs appearing. The new hair was long enough to cut two-three months and continues to improve. I am 43, brown hair, thinning for about 10 years on crown top and front.    As others have reported, it goes on oily and takes about an hour to cure/dry. Brush or comb after it dries. It will stain your pillow if applied shortly before bedtime. I have not had a dandruff problem but have noticed a white buildup on my hairbrush that sometimes flakes off sticking to the treated area. I use a second hairbrush when it dries to clean the lint and spread the dry hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and I honestly feel that it has worked quickly and with good results for me.  I have the basic thinning at the top of the head and since using this product my hair in that area is a lot thicker. I&#x27;m already planning to wear haircuts I haven&#x27;t worn in years. Perhaps it doesn&#x27;t work for everybody but its worth and try and I&#x27;m glad I checked into it. Also, perhaps my thinning isn&#x27;t as severe but I only really need to apply the product once a day for decent results.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for quite sometime now, i have used another famous brand prior to this for 3 months. This product is as good as any leading brand, and at the same time costs much less.  i will strongly recomend using it.</li>
    <li> i am using it for less then 3 weeks i will wait to see the effect</li>
    <li> I have been using it since December of 08, and I was about to give up on it, but I kept trying. It finally started paying off around the 2.5 month mark. I started seeing rapid growth, and even had a lot of people asking me what I was doing. Now it&#x27;s getting longer and thicker, and I would say It has rejuvenated about 30 percent on my hairline. My problem was the front was getting thinner and i know it says not to use it that way, but I did.. and I am HAPPY with the results. It&#x27;s worth the money and so much more.</li>
    <li> I have tried the product for 3 weeks, but I couldn&#x27;t keep the treatment because the oily vehicle worsted my dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;The excess of oil in the scalp is terrible for people with already oily hair and dermatitis. If the vehicle were alcohol, would be better.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month and a half and its been working great. I was worried because i started losing hair by my temples and it was becoming more and more noticeable. Thank god i didnt wait for it to get worse and started using this rubbing in the product with my hands sometimes I went over the dosage and used it 3 times a day. My hair is short so that way i ensure that the product isnt being evaporated in thin air but absorbd by my scalp. My advice is donttt waitttt get ittt. At this price you cant go wrong. And itll help too if you monitor your stress level as well and exercise. Ill be using this product till i die. Thanksss Kirklanddd.</li>
    <li> I bought this minoxidil after reading several reviews that said it worked on the forehead area also (on the box it says back of the head, bald spot, only). Ive been using it now for 3 months and I can agree that it does work. Within a coupe of days of starting the program, I noticed that I was losing much less hair. After two months I noticed that I couldn&#x27;t see as much scalp on my forehead as I could before. This stuff works!</li>
    <li> All was great. No words to share to the derogatory. Product was on time, as advertised, and more than could be expected. Thanks</li>
    <li> It is only 3 weeks that I am using this product. May be I can write a better review after 2 months of use as they have mentioned that it may take 2 to 4 months to see positive result.    After 3 weeks of use, now I can see some new hairs around the thinning area, and gradually I am getting confident with it. But at the same time I am loosing my hair too.     I shall update my review after completing my 2 months with it.</li>
    <li> the seller doesnt even have the items. he will charge for it and and after 2 weeks he will apologize and refund u the money it a joke ,just dont waste ur time with this seller</li>
    <li> Given the reports that minoxidil also works on the front part of the head, I decided to try it. However, I had to stop using it after 2 months because of blurred vision which is a rare, reported side effect of minoxidil. This was most obvious when I looked at a traffic light 1 or 2 blocks away. I would get 2 or 3 images of the light which would merge as I got closer. The blurring occurs because these 2 or 3 images get superimposed on each other. I stopped using the minoxidil for a week and my vision is almost back to normal. I will try it again, but only using having the recommended dosage. By the way, no hair growth yet. Also, my name is Mark, not Marilyn. This website insists on using my wife&#x27;s name even though it should know otherwise.</li>
    <li> Hi,    I have started using this one week back , I will get back with the effects if they happen, for now I want to know that, I have Mild Face swelling, Mainly in  Forehead and surrounding area, Mild Red Bumps, I want to know if this is a side effect or allergic reaction, would it go or should i discontinue usage, For now I have reduced the Dosage to Half.    Help Appreciated !</li>
    <li> I now use this product with a dab of Retin-A (Tretinoin) .1% (w/ the nightime application only), since I recently read the combination increases the effects of Minoxydil by 2 - 3x.</li>
    <li> It is a good product, but you need to start the treatment upon your hair loss starts, other wise you will not get the expected result. I recommend this product especially for its price.</li>
    <li> I was kinda hopeful after reading all the reviews here that I could probably grow some hair too. So I bought this product and have been using this religiously for almost 4 months. I restrained myself from looking at my crown in the mirror or take a photo of it for these 4 months as I only wanted to look at the results after 4 months (the product info asks you to use it for 4 months at least and stop if no results are seen). To my disappointment, the hair loss seems like it worsened. The crown looks balder than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the product does say that the results are not the same for all men, and so I will keep using it for another 2 months or so till I finish the bottles. I hear stories of guys saying this product has worked so well for them but I guess I am not one of them. I am giving it 2 stars because the product is definitely a cheaper alternative to the more expensive brand named products and is slightly easier on the pocket.</li>
    <li> Best price around.  Speedy service.  No hassles.  What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> Skip to second paragraph if you don&#x27;t want to hear my background information. I am a 22 year old male with mild frontal recession that I noticed sometime in late 2009. I never thought I would have to even think about early hair loss because it is nearly unprecedented in the past few generations of male ancestors. For some reason though, I got in my head the idea that my hair is not as thick as it used to be in Nov. 2009. Internet research led me to check my hairline and crown to see if I have MPB. I have definitely lost hair in the corners of my hairline but even though this is normal for a non-balding young man I am concerned by the steepness of the recession. My father, however, has an unusually sharp hairline as well that has pretty much stayed the same for decades so I hope its just my normal genetic hairline. I have always had a high hairline so corner recession is unwelcome. I have Asperger&#x27;s Syndrome which makes me inclined to be obsessed with certain things and the hair is now one of them. I notice and think about the hairline of every guy I see whether in real life or in movies or TV shows. When I&#x27;m at college, I sometimes get upset that I don&#x27;t have the awesome hairlines that so many other young men have but I also notice that there are quite a few young men who have MPB.     I have been using Minoxidil about ten times a week for eight months and have seen no further recession in the hairline corners and negligible re-growth has occurred--It&#x27;s kind of like long peach fuzz that seems to be turning into baby hairs but I don&#x27;t know yet. It has helped bring my temporal peaks back which is good because I didn&#x27;t look as good without them. For this important cosmetic aspect my use of minoxidil was well worth it. For the new year I have pledged to use it twice a day religiously in the hopes that I can get some better re-growth in the corners. I&#x27;m not sure if my corners would have receded more without this; its hard to tell because I don&#x27;t have any miniaturizationor thinning behind where my hairline is now and never did. I am now using Rogaine Foam in the morning and the liquid at night.</li>
    <li> I have been using Minoxidil for many years, long past the time it could have been useful in regrowing any hair on my head. I am 70 years old. I believe it has slowed down the onset of total baldness for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this product 5 months ago and I noticed a bit of growth on the temples. I hate putting this stuff on and its kinda messy. It seems that all the work I put into applying minoxidil was for nothing because after 48 weeks it wont work anymore on anybody due to the fact that your body builds up resistance to it. Dont waste your money on something that will stop working. All these products are scams because they come from a business that just wants to make money. Who knows what were putting into our body with this stuff.</li>
    <li> O produto é do jeito que imaginava, porém não posso fornecer um diagnóstico sobre sua eficácia, pois estou usando somente por dois dias.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 23 and I started to notice that my hair was thinning 3 years ago. I have always had a shaved head since I was a kid, so at first it didn&#x27;t really notice. I was starting to get to the stage however that I was becoming very conscious of my hair and under strong lights, the hair loss was very noticeable. for the last year or so every time I would look in the mirror, my hair loss would be getting worse and worse. although I had not attained any complete bold spots, they were not too far off forming.    I hence got to the point where I thought that it is time to try and fight back. I have a degree in molecular medicine so I thoroughly researched all available options and Minoxidil is medically accepted to have some hair regrowth/ maintenance effects, so I brought a 3 months supply of the Kirklands product and gave it a go.    I have been using the product twice a day all over my head, including the front hairline. Just under two months in and my hair is getting thicker all over. I cant explain what a great feeling it is to look in the mirror and see that my hair is getting thicker, instead of thinner!    However I do predict that the regrowth will reach a cut off point and then gradually begin to recede again, but at a much slower rate, however at this stage it is still getting thicker. Hence there is no doubt for me that Its a worth while treatment, which DOES help. And forget the adverse effects, people will always find something to moan about..they are MINOR</li>
    <li> Ive been using this for 3 years now. I started using it when I was 19 and in college. I noticed that I was quickly losing my hair after I graduated highschool. During my freshman yr in college I remember noticing a big change over the course of the yr. Since I started using this stuff, my hair has pretty much stayed nearly the exact same over the last 3 yrs. My thin hair is still noticable, but I believe this stuff has kept it from becoming signicantly worse. I recently decided to stop for about a month or so to see if there would be any change since ive been using this for awhile now and I definatley started to notice a difference so I started right back up.     I use this stuff every night and occasionally in the mornings. You are suppose to use it twice a day but it makes my scalp irritated and gives  me some dandruff, thus I prefer not to use it a lot in the mornings. THe times when I did use it twice a day for a few months I did start to notice some hair growth, but its hard to use so consistently. I have been fairly happy with this, and feel it is extending the time before Im bald.</li>
    <li> Minoxidil seems to work ok and in my case it appears to have worked everywhere I have tried it (as a test).  I tried it around the the border of my face and ended up with pale peach fuzz on my temples bridging the area between my eyebrows and side burns.    But you must stick to a strict regimen - forgetting a day or so isn&#x27;t gonna make your hair drop but twice daily is the way to go.  If the other sex can commit to \\&quot;the pill\\&quot; everyday, then we should be able to handle a few drops, massaging it in our scalps.</li>
    <li> Well the product shown is not what I received. The first time I bought this from Amazon it came just as it is shown in a sealed retail box with the dropper. This time the three bottles came loose, packed in a generic bubble wrap envelope along with a cheap clear plastic dropper. The three bottles are not sealed so I don&#x27;t know for sure what&#x27;s in them, at least with the seal box I was a little more reassured. Right now I&#x27;m considering discarding this stuff and just going to costco and buying it off the shelf.</li>
    <li> Good deal but would be better if they include one sprayer instead of two droppers.</li>
    <li> Great Product, but application is somewhat difficult. It is a little greasy and takes about thirty minutes to dry completely. Not a problem just has to be strategically planned into your routine, because it is difficult to style hair before it completely dries. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy. It also appears to be working well on my receding hairline, but I apply it there religiously. Highly Recommend. I give four stars only for the time it takes to dry.</li>
    <li> I used this product for over 10 years. I wondered if it was necessary to keep using so I quit for about three months. My hair started falling out in brush fulls, so I started using again hair loss stopped and lost hair started to re-grow. I am 73 years young and I just got a compliment on my hair by a much younger man, stating that he wished he could have hair like mine... I ordered on Monday, it shipped on Tuesday and was received on Wednesday and the price was right... I am completely safisfied.</li>
    <li> I have been using generic Walmart rogain for years and had success.  I ordered the kirkland / costco brand from Amazon because there are no Walmarts close to Washington, DC.  After three weeks of use, I have had significant and and noticeable hair loss.  The product is also much more runny and doesn&#x27;t seem as concentrated.  3 Pack of generic Walmart rogain is $25 and I ordered it from there website.  It was shipped to my door in 3 days for $1.  Don&#x27;t risk it with this kirkland stuff...you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a couple of weeks (on my eyebrows, applied 1-2x a day with a Q-tip)&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m pleased with the results. I have sparse brows and I&#x27;ve noticed they look thicker and less patchy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27; plan to update this review after a few months, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;Forgot to update this but it definitely helped my  eyebrows grow in. I dont even need to use it anymore. So as a generic product id recommend it</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of the product. It took about three months to see results. I had very thin hair. It saved what I had and grew some. Highly RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this minoxidil product because of its low cost.  However, It caused severe itching and dryness.  Far more than other minoxidil products.  I ended up using a couple of months worth.</li>
    <li> This item made my scalp tough and itch like crazy. I stopped using it and found another product. My hair has almost completely grown back in with my new product. This may work for you but it didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I recomended this product for hair regrow is the best and the price much better,I never see nothing equal.  Minoxidil-5% Extra Strength Hair Regrowth for Men, 6 Month Supply</li>
    <li> I started using Rogaine foam back in mid-September.  A little backstory first:  since 8 years ago, I&#x27;ve started to develop this bald spot on the crown of my head.  Luckily, it didn&#x27;t get worse from there but it was definitely a discernible bald spot which folks from time to time would point out.  What pushed me over the edge was when I got married and in preparation for my reception, the salon I went to tried to cover up the spot by spraying black paint on it.  I thought, WTF?  So I saw the Rogaine foam and thought I&#x27;d give it a whirl.  I liked the foam, but I didn&#x27;t care for the price for a three-month supply.    Then I found out that the Kirkland brand was MUCH cheaper and still contained the 5% minoxidil strength so I bought a box at Costco and gave it a try.    At about mid-October, my wife remarked to me that she could swear my bald spot was going away.  I kept looking at it with a handheld mirror, but I was trying to keep it absolutely real and didn&#x27;t think there was any difference.  Then comes mid-November, and I could definitely see more hair there. thicker or something.  Whatever it was, something was covering the scalp skin and it looked like hair to me.  Now...I can say for certain that the stuff works and I&#x27;m very happy it did.  My cousin opted for implants but that is pricey.  My father is trying to use it now but he suffers from a lot of itchiness.  Luckily, I don&#x27;t get that itchy, if at all.  I know I will have to use this for life, but it really is economical with this brand (compared to, say, plugs).    It worked for me, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it will work for all.  But give it a shot.  It&#x27;s not that expensive compared to the alternatives.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I&#x27;m down to 3 bottles in approx 2 months. It says 1 bottle will last for 1 month. But I&#x27;ve been using it for the whole of my front scalp, so it take more than the prescribed 1ml of the dropper.  I use the dropper and then my fingers tips to work it in (and then wash the hands thoroughly).  Although I had got them 4-5 months back, I actually started using them in the last 2 months, having read about the side effects. But thankfully, I haven&#x27;t been affected by any (ED, dandruff, itching, flaky scalp etc), other than a runny nose at times. But that&#x27;s coz I&#x27;m prone to getting the cold and having a wet head doesn&#x27;t really help. I use it twice a day. Yes, it does make your hair stiff, but you need to comb before it goes dry and your hair will stay put till your next wash.   As far as the does-it-work-or-not question goes..well, there is an improvement. I mean if you stand in front of the mirror, the very next morning expecting to find new hair, you will be disappointed (trust me, I looked...). I know for sure that the strands have thickened. I&#x27;ve lost quite a lot in the frontal zone and can see through the scalp. The vertex is fine. And this was going to be my last attempt at growing hair before going for the shaved &#x27;bald look&#x27;.  I can see that the bald patches have definitely diminished. But I was pleasantly surprised when others started commenting, specially my barber.  I also apply a little on the temple, where I had hair earlier but has long gone..and that area has around 3-5 hair growing from there. I have to clip them off coz it looks a little weird.  So yes, it does work, if you are persistent.   And I don&#x27;t think these make any difference, but jotting it down just as an fyi. I take NOW Foods Biotin 5000mcg everyday, but once those get over, will move to Hairomega DHT capsules. And I use Nexxus shampoo, every third day. But I do wash my hair daily with lukewarm water.  I will update this post after 2 months..hopefully with more good news...(fingers crossed...)</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and great communications (even know delay was on Canada side and had nothing to do with him). Outstanding service.</li>
    <li> I was experiencing higher and higher hairline.  I read that this product might not work for lowering the hair line.  However, I tried anyway and it worked for me.  It took 1 months to see very thin hair that you would question \\&quot;is that real?\\&quot;  By 3rd month, I saw very convincing results that my M shape forehead has improved a lot.  I went to a haircut, the barbor was asking me, do you want to keep my old style and shorten it a bit.  I said yes.  He then ask, did you used to shave your forehead since there are some area where hairs are all short? I responded saying \\&quot;Those hair are always short\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Apply twice a day and you&#x27;ll be brushing a thick mop of new hair in a few months. This 5% solution has worked very well together with my 5 mg Finasteride taken daily for prostrate health.</li>
    <li> Ten years ago, I was surprised when my doctor told me I had the start of male pattern baldness. He recommended 5% Rogaine, but I purchased generic minoxidil because it was less than half the price.    With persistent application twice a day for ten years, I have managed to maintain a good stock of hair, altho bit thinner than I&#x27;d like.  In fact, my hair is one of my most attractive features the ladies tell me.     I have only two minor complaints.  One is the oiliness.  The other is the tendency to turn light colored hair blond.  I am 68 and my hair is largely grey. My hair was sandy when I was younger.  The area where I apply the lotion is not my natural hair color, but a blond.  But I live with these two minor defects and would recommend this product    Oiliness is more pronounced if you hair is very thin. If you have enough hair the application of minoxidil is partically concealed and you hair to helps absorb it into your scalp. However, if you wait until you are without hair, its application will be  more noticeable, leading to the complaint about oiliness.  Don&#x27;t wait too long before starting treatment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve switched over to Kirkland from Rogain foam for a trial period.  I have a generally dry scalp which the butane in Rogain did not help with. After 3 weeks the Kirkland has not caused significant problems for me...I will follow up after 3 months.  Although the foam is much easier to apply and seems to soak into the scalp with more finesse-(and/or dries faster)- I find Kirkland a satisfactory economical substitute.  I have seen continued growth with the switch.  Currently coming up on my 7th month of total use (w/rogain) i have about 20% more hair. Not much but I was at stage 5 baldness- i had a  little left at the bridge between the crown and frontal lobe but it was sparse so i didn&#x27;t expect much.  I had a life situation that i think contributed to some premature hair loss so i decided to give my dome a \\&quot;second life\\&quot; for a while. Its slowly filling in toward the front now so we shall see in a year. The trick to using the kirkland is to cut your hair short (just as you would if you wanted a good contact surface with rogain) and spend some time working it into the scalp.  It is a bit oily but its not all that bad if you distribute the excess into the rest of your hair after working it in. Be smart about it and be good to your head. Cheers.    [...]</li>
    <li> 2nd time buying product. Excellent product and does work as described. Quick service and packaging is perfect. Will order again in the future</li>
    <li> Ok side effects mentioned on the box are like can cause a rash, dizzines, burning scalp, upset stomach, acne, headaches.  It even mentioned causing a faster than usual heart beat and or chest pains which still didn&#x27;t stop me from using this product.  With in a week of using this product I was experiencing cold sweats at night, extreme tiredness and sleepyness.  At the same time I experienced some sexual disfunction to eventually full erectile disfunction.  I gave my doctor a call and he told me that there is a very small 2 percent chance this can happen, which is why he never told me when he recomended I used Minoxidil for my hair loss.  I immediately stopped using this product and guess what, cold sweats became less prominent and my manhood returned.  So since I came here first to read the reviews which is why I bought this product it is only best I submit a review of my experience with this product.  Please keep this in mind I wish I had read this before I used it.</li>
    <li> I am 23 years old and I started getting bald 2 years ago. I used to use Minoxidil 2% for 6 months and it was working without any side effects. I realized some new hair was growing and everything was fine. I ran out of Minoxidil 2% and decided to buy Kirkland Minoxidil 5%. (expecting to see better results in less time).     Side Effects:I have never had dandruff and I started having this problem (I bought a special shampoo to avoid this issue), then 20 minutes after application my head becomes itchy (but only for some minutes) and my brother&#x27;s hair is getting blonder ( I didn&#x27;t have that problem).     Positive things: It works much faster than 2%, and it is quite cheaper than other brands. It definitely works!!!    Personal Advise or personal point of view: Use this product if you don&#x27;t have much money to spend and want to see some quick and efficient results but be ready for side effects.If you want to avoid side effects or have never used this type of products. You better start with Minoxidil 2% from another brand or with another active ingridient that avoids side effects.     Hope you find this useful folks,</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about two years now. It has definitely made a difference, and there is hair regrowth where there was none before.</li>
    <li> I bought a 6 month supply, 3 months in so far, no results to speak of. Its possible it will take longer, and its possible there will be no results at all but its been more than the 2 months expected so I&#x27;m giving it a 3 because to be fair they didn&#x27;t \\&quot;promise\\&quot; you any results at all.</li>
    <li> Purchased a six month supply and have used 7 days a week for 5 months so far. I am 24 years old and started using product when I could see a bald spot coming in on the top back of my head and thinning hair all over the top. I do recommend using minoxidil (no brand preference) and also ask your doc for a generic perscription for Allopecia (male pattern baldness). I started taking Finestride (generic Proscar), in combination with minoxidil, last week and notice slightly less hair loss. Will wait for about 2 months to see if i notice less hair in the shower drain before i make any conclusions for myself. I have missed applying the minoxidil a couple days but never more than 3 and I&#x27;m seeing good results. I have definently seen some regrowth on the top of my head in the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This topical solution must be applied morning and night. I have tried the Rogaine Foam before and it was hard to apply for I wear my hair longer. So, i would recommend foam for bald or buzzed heads, but if you have longer hair (inch and more) definently go for the topical solution! The product needs to soak into the scalp but wont if you cant apply the foam through your hair. About once every two weeks I have big flakey dandruff from where it is applied. By prepared to check yourself once a day and make sure your not freaking others out in the elevator it haha! Also, it is true that the product sends your hair into constant regrowth mode so dont freak but continue to use product even when intially you lose more hair. It is sign that your weak follicles are entering regrowth mode and about to grow a new, thicker, shaft of hair. Hope this helps! Don&#x27;t be afraid to ask doctor!</li>
    <li> Ok............This is the score on this product.  Any company that promises you hair growth is just looking in to cash in on your dream to have a full head of hair again.  Yet..............this product does deliver on thing ! It does stop the continued loss of hair. I have used this product for almost five years now and I do admit it has stopped  my hair from thinning. But growing a full head of hair is just wishful thinking. This has been my experience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 24, and have been noticing my hair thinning since I was around 20 years old. The thinning has been occurring both on the crown of my head and the front. Although there were no completely bald spots (except where the hairline was receding), the thinning was extremely apparent, and the top of my head would probably have been completely bald within a couple years.    I have been using this product since the beginning of May. Because I&#x27;m still pretty young and my balding was not too advanced yet, I have only been applying the product about once a day (I&#x27;ve missed a couple days here and there). Although the product is not officially approved for the frontal baldness, I&#x27;ve been applying it both to the top of my head and the front.      As of about a week ago, I noticed a significant amount of new hair growing within the thinning area. Indeed, if I were to cut my hair short right now, the thinning would be barely noticeable anymore. My boyfriend even commented that the change was very apparent.    This supply will probably last me almost a year since I use about half of what&#x27;s recommended. In the future, when the balding would be more significant, I may have to use more to keep up... but either way, I am very satisfied with the product&#x27;s performance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 1 month so far and it&#x27;s absolutely fantastic! It&#x27;s a quality product and at a much much more affordable price if you really look around at different retailers selling the same thing.  It&#x27;s working and because of that, I give it a five star rating and any guy whose losing a little hair on his crown should consider buying this product - It really does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James Moore&lt;br /&gt;Atlanta, Ga</li>
    <li> May work for some, saw no results in our case. Oily feel to serum.</li>
    <li> Okay I have used this for about 2 1/2 months with good success . I had a bald spot on the crown and thinning on top all the way to the front . My hair on top was falling out fast . Clogging the drain in the shower every day . With use of this i have started growing hair on the crown and although no hair growth yet on the top it has stopped it from falling out . I have not had to clean out the drain screen in a while now .   Okay the one side effect . The Kirkland brand although very affordable 24.00 for 6 months as opposed to 30.00 for one month of Rogaine does NOT dry clear in the hair like they say and like Rogaine does . It dries up clear on the scalp as it soaks in but on my light brown hair it remains sticky and a light shiny gray , kind of fuzzy looking and very noticeable . It does help to try and dry it out of my hair with a towel but kind of hard to do without drying it off the scalp .   It also has stopped the falling out of hair on my beard at my chin . Still bald in a small area but no longer falling out .   I may try the foam next to see how it dries up .</li>
    <li> First off the shipping was fast and the product was in pristine condition. I anxiously tried the product not knowing what to expect. I used propecia and dutasteride for years and got moderate results. After only 2 weeks there was considerable regrowth and after 1.5 months I have a completely new hairline! I am not the hat guy anymore as I am confident to wear my hair and not have people stare cuz of the exposed scalp.    For those of you thinking of trying it out give it a shot its so cheap! I have to disclose a few things. In my research of minoxidil I have found it is best for those with recent hair loss, with thick individual shafts, I.e. coarse hair. Asian or hispanic/mediterrenean work best. Also those with thinning hair works better than baling/receeding hair. Those who have had recent telogen effluvium or shedding works great cuz all the new hair sprouts up at once! Finally the first 2 weeks I used the FOAM, then foam in the morning for styling &amp; quicker drying purposes and liquid generic at night to save costs on the expensive FOAM. Also when you try the liquid it will make your hair look even more sparse so I recommend the foam in the a.m. I actually think the liquid is more effective though. Good luck!</li>
    <li> This product causes my scalp itch to a degree that I never knew was humanly possible. Literally it&#x27;s like the itch demon fairy princess from hell came and was digging into your scalp with an \\&quot;itch-wand\\&quot; that has needles at its ends dabbed with poison. I kid you not. This doesn&#x27;t occur right when I put it on, but I&#x27;ll get itch attacks during the day. And when these attacks occur, dare you even touch one follicle of hair in the area where the Rogaine was applied, the painful scratchy sensation increases a thousand fold. In other words, it itches like crazy, but if you try to scratch it, you will see the gates of Hell looming before you, as it punishes you for even attempting to try to relieve some pressure off your head.     Will I keep using it? I don&#x27;t know... I can honestly say my mental ability to stay laser focused has increased n-th fold as I am getting my daily practice during these itch-attacks. My hair in the front looks pretty good, but it in the back, not so much. . . Until I get a wife, I think I will keep using it, and then shock her as soon as I drop the Minoxidil after we get married. She&#x27;ll be stuck to me anyhow. . . .</li>
    <li> Product was delivered on time and packed very nicely. Professional service. Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> One friend bought this one.    And he told me it did work and he had more hair now ... ...  But to be frankly,  I didn&#x27;t see big difference.  It may be because I didn&#x27;t pay attention to his appearance at all?</li>
    <li> I am young and in the beginning stages of balding.  So far it has stopped the falling out.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 6 month and I am happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It works&lt;br /&gt;- Affordable.&lt;br /&gt;- It works even if I apply it only once a day. In the beginning I used to apply it twice a day but it was too much hassle so it started using only once a day and it still works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives are:&lt;br /&gt;- The long time it takes it to dry. It has a wet look for at least an hour and the hair looks much worse when wet. At times I blow dried it a bit to hasten the drying.&lt;br /&gt;- I wish it was easier to apply. It flows down the head if I don&#x27;t smear well enough. I now use a cotton stick to spread it while applying. It seems to help.</li>
    <li> been using twice daily for about a month now...i had a pretty bad receiding hair line going but this stuff is defintaly helping.  My receiding hairline is all filled in with peach fuzz and it is getting thicker.      only bad part is if it accidently drips down my face i will break out in acne where ever it went.  Just gotta make sure to wash your face/hands really well after applying if you have oily skin.      if it dries your scalp out i recommend head and shoulders</li>
    <li> Before using this product I consulted a doctor about it and she approved.  I´ve been using it for 2 months and the results have been good. New hair is growing.   &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Shouldn&#x27;t six months be six bottles?&lt;br /&gt;Other products have six bottles at same. 5%&lt;br /&gt;there is even another Kirkland that says three months with same three bottles.&lt;br /&gt;What this about?</li>
    <li> The product says it does not work on receeding hairlines but i figure i still give it a try. Its true it does not work on receeding hairlines but it does grow more thick hair towards bald spots. I reccommend this to everyone..</li>
    <li> I started balding noticeably in my mid-twenties and had finally come to the decision to do something about it.  I started looking around for products which were effective and also reasonably priced.  I found myself at Costco with my wife and saw this product.  At the price (roughly the same as Amazon, but a few dollars cheaper), I thought, why not give this a shot.  It took a good 1.5 months to see any real change, but I did freak out a bit during the shedding stage. (my wife will confirm)  I was expecting a bit more hair regrowth, but maybe my hopes and expectations were higher than what you&#x27;re supposed to see realistically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a decent product at the price.  Not a miracle worker.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Kirkland Minoxidil 5% for ~1.5 month and the WalMart Equate brand for ~3 months prior to switching over.  The reason for the switch was the better pricing on the Kirkland brand.  To date I have gained ~25% (subjective) on my bald spot with minimal side effects (very slight scalp irritation and itching).  I have not noticed any improvement in the frontal recession except there has been no significant progression which is good.  I did read up on the initial studies done with Minoxidil and discovered that the patients were using an anti-dandruff shampoo (Neutrogena T Gel) on a daily basis to minimize any inflammatory scalp conditions which may interfere with the interpretation of the scalp biopsies.  So that is what I am doing and it appears to have kept the dandruff and scalp irritation in check.  Also I read that the combination of Minoxidil and low dose Finasteride (brand name Propecia)  resulted in \\&quot;good hair regrowth\\&quot; in &gt; 80% of the patients in the studies.  Propecia (1 mg Finasteride) is not covered by insurance, is ~$120 for 30 days and needs to be prescribed.  A very cheap alternative is to ask your doctor for a generic Finasteride (5 mg) and cut the pills in quarters which is very cheap and turns a 30 day prescription into a 120 day supply.  Finasteride is the medicine that reduces the risk of benign prostatic hypertrophy and for us older guys this is an added benefit though at the ~1 mg dose it may not have much effect on the prostate.  Also the side effects are minimal to none at this dosage.  I have not seen any discoloration of the hair though the hairs are fine and may be not durable as my normal hair.  I plan to re-evaluate at the 6 and 12 month marks and see if I will continue with these products.  No I did not expect or am I expecting a full head of hair like I had when I was 25 years old but I have been satisfied with the results so far.  Though if I had a nicely shaped head I would probably just shave it bald! :)</li>
    <li> I was extremely attracted to this item, which advertised a 6-month supply for about the same price as a 3-month supply from Wal-mart. Looking closer, though, I see that the box has 3 2-ounce bottles. The Wal-mart Equate is also 3 2-ounce bottles, and it is the same strength. The fine print on the Kirkland box says \\&quot;UP TO\\&quot; 6 months. Caveat emptor!</li>
    <li> I used to buy rogaine and was very satisfied, althouhg a little bit grease, it not only stop my hair loss (that started in the frontal and near temporal hairline), but recover all the volume i used to have in my 20s! (now im 40). Never had any adverse reaction but only little heart rate increment the first two days i started the treatment. After 4 years of using it usually spending us$ 200 a year (anyway a little price to avoid going bald!) decided it was time to find the generic (most of the time costing a fraction of the branded ones)but taking the risk that generics not always work as well as renamed brands. I ordered the 6 months supply from kirkland (a us$ 30 value against 100 for rogaine) and i have to say that \\&quot;I FEEL\\&quot; it is working better than rogaine: No more grease hair, I BELIEVE my hair grows faster (after any haircut)but for shure my hair is getting stronger. Rogaine works, but this one works better and a lot more cheaper!, a no brainer.</li>
    <li> well, i can&#x27;t say for sure this product will work for everyone...but its working for me.....i noticed that i am experiencing less hair loss on the top of my head, and new hairs are growing out on the hairline at the top of my forehead....so i have decided to continue using it....i have compared the product content of this item against rogaine and THEY ARE EXACTLY THE SAME....so why waste more money on rogaine when you can buy this for a lot cheaper....the last thing that i want to bring up is the price...i don&#x27;t know why it never occur to me to look for this product at costco since its kirkland brand...so i have always bought this at amazon....but during one visit to costco, i found this exact same product (6 month supply) on the shelf for $16.97.....and i have been buying it from amazon for $26.97 or something like that.......don&#x27;t get me wrong, i love to buy stuff from amazon because of wide selection, no tax, and free shipping....but for this item, i will be buying it straight from costco during my routine visits unless amazon can reduce the price to come close to the costco price.....so final words on this product....excellent product and superb alternative to the expensive rogaine...</li>
    <li> I cant believe when I received monixidil they were expired. LOT/EXP 07-2010. I received this package in Miami but the fina user is in eecuador so its very difficul to return this product. i want my money back or other product</li>
    <li> Initially i was bit skeptical about the product and after trying it with two months my hair fall decreased and still I am using it.&lt;br /&gt;But I have used rogaine  also. The difference is rogaine  is more costlier than this one. But both does the same job but when used the rogaine one my hair was smoother but kirkland one is bit sticky. I have a clue for that..trim your hair bit shorter and use kirkland minoxidil we dont observer that stickness any more.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t see any results</li>
    <li> The manufacturer instructs on the label of the product that \\&quot;Results may occur at 2 months\\&quot; sounds like \\&quot;don&#x27;t be surprised if there are none\\&quot;. It has discouraged me from using the product.</li>
    <li> Been 1 month and waiting to see if results will be noticed in the future or not.  Easy to use though, just have to remember.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 years, I have had no regrowth, but I have also had no more loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 26, when I was 23 I noticed that my hair had gotten quite thin on top. After about another 3 months of procrastinating, I purchased this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product since then and I have not lost any more hair, it is still thin, but i haven&#x27;t gone bald.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So is it worth the money? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it magic? No.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband, and he said after using he felt his hair got a little thicker.</li>
    <li> I started using this product 2 years ago and have noticed my hair is thicker and stronger. You have to use it faithfully as the directions say and be patient. My hair was just starting to get thin so if you have really thin hair this might not be the answer.    If you&#x27;ve noticed some thinning and want it to stop, this stuff&#x27;s for you. It&#x27;s a great price too.</li>
    <li> I am a 34yr old hispanic male that been losing my hair ever since I can remember  , I was 90% bald and was not liking how I looked , I tried monoxidil for one month in the past but gave up even before I saw results cause of the cost of the drug at my local drugstores . I was surprise on how inexpensive the monoxidil was on Amazon so decide it to give a try . The product was right on time , came package in a little bag with three bottles . I was so happy to try it for a long period of time and let me tell you that I am happy with the results , I saw results with in the first month . It all starts with the growth of tiny white hairs and gradually takes color until you have a darker looking hair , I have been using it for about 5 months and I have seen some growth , I wish that I would of stayed on it when I first use monoxidil from the store but is cool , I&#x27;m happy with the results . For the price is a great steal and Im very happy and I had more growth in my frontal areas so yes It does work all the way around .. I am saying that going to have a Afro in one month but what I&#x27;m saying is a great product and I am very please with it and if you are having thoughts about  using monoxidil .. Trust , me go with this product ... Inexpensive and has good results .. Hope that this was helpful information .. Love and I&#x27;m out.:-)</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for nearly two months, and i have seen growing some new hair on my forehead, i definitely recommend this product. of course help yourself with a shampoo to avoid the hair drop</li>
    <li> Yes, you get sticky hair...but you do get hair! I&#x27;ve been using it for a while and after a few weeks, I got major improvements. Affordable and non-intrusive!</li>
    <li> I use this product on a daily bassist, I started several years ago when I noticed my hair thinning. I was dumbfounded, then by chance I read the warnings on that came with my prescriptions and there it was &amp;#34; May cause Hair thinning or Balding&amp;#34; I headed to the drug store and found those Minoxidil 5% products that had been discounted but still costly so I went home and went online and at that time there were more than a dozen&lt;br /&gt;vendors selling Minoxidil so the prices were reasonable. When purchasing as of late the number of Vendors has dropped. The Kirkland Company is loaded with products that are far more pricey but are no different from the products they sold years ago. I was happy to find this private seller who had exactly what I needed at a more than reasonable price. I enjoyed the rapid response from the Seller, and I will return to him as long as he has&lt;br /&gt;stock at these prices. I would certainly recommend this Seller to anyone seeking to stabilize their hair line for yet another day.</li>
    <li> Something that many people of color know when shopping for personal care products is to pay very close attention to whether or not a particular product works for \\&quot;us\\&quot; as well. Well this stuff does. I don&#x27;t think I will realistically ever be able to grow waves again, but using this product at least buys me a few days before my balding spot becomes too noticeable. I also happened to have a prescription for Tretinoin from my dermatologist and read articles online that using the two products together can enhance hair growth. So I use both, only using the Tretinoin in the mornings.  This stuff is very runny and will not dry or be absorbed if you have short hair, so I apply it using a cotton ball and then using a dab of Tretinoin.</li>
    <li> This stuff only created peach fuzz and nothing more, and left my scalp flaking and white looking.</li>
    <li> I received this product in less than the promised delivery time and actually received more of the product than I expected!  Thanks again for excellent AND quick delivery, Amazon.com!!</li>
    <li> It took a little long to get here but was just the same as the prescription Minoxidol 5% prescribed for me here only much less expensive. I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually review products, but this one is so great I had to. It is so much cheaper than Rogaine, and works better. My receding hairline has grown back, and I&#x27;m not losing my hair anymore. It is great!</li>
    <li> Although neither this liquid solution nor the foam helped my thinning hair, the Rogaine Foam treatment was MUCH easier to use.  The liquid solution runs down your cheeks and back of the neck.  It also stays oily the entire day.  What a mess.  Buy the Rogaine Foam instead.</li>
    <li> I ordered my first box on here but then had to dump it in international customs and ended up buying it again at COSTCO for around the same price.  Im 23 but have the body of a 40 year old, very strange indeed :)   I had to start shaving in 3rd grade, was 6 feet tall in sixth grade, and have pretty much stopped growing all around.  Unfortunately, my hair took a hit too when I was 21.  I had nice long hair but cut it all off when I went to an Army training course and it just never really grew back on top.  It was super thin on top and didnt grow in the front besides two little patches.  Also I had a pretty bad bald spot.  Seeing pictures of my hair made me rather sad.  Finally I got this and am very suprised.  I usually bic my head so I continued to do so while applying this 2x a day.  After about 2 months I noticed hair growing where it was not before.  The top of my head is coming in slow and surely.  Rather suprised to see it growing some good hairs on my hair line which is going to be nice.  Remember it takes awhile for the medicine to work, thats why I continued to shave my head.  This is definately better than Nioxin and especially effective if you started hair loss within the past few years.  The price is right also, and be sure to get the 5% and not the 2%.</li>
    <li> It works but you have to keep using it.</li>
    <li> My pattern doesn&#x27;t respond. Oh well.</li>
    <li> Use it twice a day and continue using it for the rest of your life; otherwise, the hair will start falling again.</li>
    <li> Six, 3 oz bottles had only one applicator...I needed at least two...one for the shower and one for my travel case.  LTDowns</li>
    <li> This is as good as Rogain if not better. It costs almost 1/3 than Rogain. I continue to see hair growth after I stopped using Rogain and used this product. Same results but lot lower price.</li>
    <li> It worked for me briefly. But it stopped working after 3 months. I need to find something else to boost my result. I was afraid to try propecia. But now it seems that I am out of choice.</li>
    <li> I am an older female so doc says it is okay to use the five percent.  However, I am not sure it does anything for thinning age due to aging.  Have not seen any improvement.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and as expected.  Have used the name brand product for a while and don&#x27;t notice a difference with Kirkland.  Why pay more?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 25 years old and male pattern baldness runs in my family. I bought this product 2 months ago and have already seen significant regrowth.  When I bought it, I thought that if I could at least slow down my hair loss, I would be satisfied.  When I bought it I figured at worst I had only wasted ~20 bucks and if it didn&#x27;t work I was going to shave my head.  I didn&#x27;t actually expect to grow back hair so when I noticed that hair was growing back (a family member actually noticed it before I did)I was pleasantly surprised.    The hair first started growing back about 3 weeks ago (so I had been using the product for 5 weeks) and it is still growing back.  I assume it will reach a point at which it has reached it&#x27;s maximum potential and stop growing back but that has not happened yet.  The product says that it is not meant to treat a receding hairline, but I applied it to my receding hairline and all over the top part of my scalp and it has worked everywhere.  It even says that hair growth is not expected to occur in places where it it has been devoid of hair for quite some time, but this was the case with my receding hairline where it is indistinguishable from my forehead in regards to the amount of hair (none) and hair grew back.      You have to apply this product 2 times a day but you can miss days.  I missed a couple of days but I never made up for it; I just continued on with the normal dose as the instructions say to do.    As I see them, here are the pros and cons:    Pros:    - It does it&#x27;s job; hair has actually grown back in as little as 5 weeks.  - Comes with a dropper and you only have to use it 2 times a day.  Easy to apply.  - Amazing bargain for what it does.  The 6 month supply is very nice.    o This doesn&#x27;t really have anything to do with the product itself, but the delivery was fast.  I got it the very next day even though I didn&#x27;t pay for next day delivery.     Cons:    - When it dries, it flakes up and looks like dandruff in your hair.  If you can help it, it&#x27;s best to apply it 2 hours or so before you have to go anywhere, and then check in the mirror for the excess flakes and remove them accordingly.  - Turned my pillow a brownish color but it washed out, so no big deal.  - Makes my scalp itch slightly.  Not real bad though.  - If you stop using it, your new hair will fall out.  You have to use it for life.    All in all, a great product.  You can&#x27;t beat the price for something as important as keeping your hair.  Until some new technology is developed that allows me regrow and keep my hair for a cheaper price, I will continue buying and using this product.  The cons are a very small price to pay for the enormous benefits.</li>
    <li> The review is for Minoxidil in general. I started loosing some hair in the front and went into a panic mode around the same time last year (Aug-Sep 2009). I went through the internet for solutions and most of them pointed to using Minoxidil or similar products. Although hair transplant was the other suggested alternative it seemed very expensive. So I opted to try this solution. To ensure Minoxidil would be effective I completely shaved my head and started using it all over my head rather than just the spot where I was losing my hair. I started with Rogaine until I realized this was a much cheaper option.    Results...  1. It took much longer to grown my hair. My scalp was visible even after 3-4 months of shaving my head. This was never the case until I tried Rogaine (minoxidil).  2. Once the hair grew to a certain length I realized it had to be strictly applied twice a day. I was following it earlier too, but now on days when I skipped once, my hair would just feel much thinner and then I could see it in the bath tub when I showered.  3. I couldn&#x27;t quite apply any type of hair cream, gel or oil. If I did I had to be extra careful that day. Couldn&#x27;t wear a cap/hat, couldn&#x27;t wet my hair and if I did wear a cap it was embarrassing to take it off. A bald spot in the front would be clearly visible. To add to it if I did any of these, again my hair would suddenly become very thin and I could see a bunch in the bath tub.  4. Initially the scalp started to feel very dry but then it started to itch so badly I couldn&#x27;t sleep at nights. The predicament was I couldn&#x27;t scratch much either due to the fear of losing more hair.    Overall the experience has been bad for me. The period I&#x27;ve used this product has been embarrassing for me. People have avoided making eye contact, sometimes plainly ignoring. Trust me, people (specially girls) would rather talk to a guy with shaved head than with someone having a bald spot. The time and effort to keep the \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; going is tremendousand to add to the misery its not worth it.  off. I&#x27;ve stopped using the product completely now and am hoping whatever hair I had before I started using this will return back sooner than later. Yet again I&#x27;ve shaved my head and am trying to keep the scalp moisturized and healthy. Its been more than a month since I shaved my head. Although the growth is not very significant I very very rarely see any hair falling off.    This paragraph is not related to the product itself so you can opt to skip it. The underlying reason for hair loss in my case was probably too much coffee and/or release of sexual hormones. I&#x27;ve cut down on the coffee intake and work out more. I&#x27;m sure working out, sweating more and burning calories does make a significant difference. I&#x27;m a vegetarian and consuming protein in forms like beans, lentils, and tofu has helped.     I&#x27;m still thankful to the makers of this product for whatever little hope it gave me during that panic mode, hence the 2 star rating.</li>
    <li> Ive used Kirkland minoxidil and since switched to Equate brand. The equate brand seems to be less sticky and seems to dry faster. I would suggest using Equate instead.</li>
    <li> Product appears to be OK, but was poorly packaged and the boxes arrived badly dented. The bottles inside are OK, or at least the ones I have checked of the six in total in two separate boxes. I did contact the seller and heard NO response.</li>
    <li> Do not let vanity destroy your health. Minoxidil will not only cause irreversible skin damage where applied but all skin because it travels your blood vessels, that damage is mainly the end of collagen production, it will also cause irreversible damage to blood vessel walls this is why it was stop being used for high blood pressure (for which it was used for originally). That is why people get the dark cicles under their eyes and easy bruising. These effects vary depending on the amount of drug absorbed and is very easy to have too much absorbed,applied to wet skin or after washing area even after dry if pores are still enlarged,destressed skin such as sunburn,dandruff or allergic reaction to any ingredient in product,higher percentages of minoxidil in product,hands used to apply it comming into contact with mouth or nose,through the hands if cuts or hangnails,from head to pillow to mouth or nose if you go to bed after applied (I could go on...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen people who used this drug only a few weeks,absorbed too much and it damaged their blood vessels so bad that wearing sandals leaves bruises where the straps are and this damage is permanent,have also seen people who sleep with their face on their arm or hand or thin pillow between have bruises on their cheekbone area or where pressure is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not an allergic reaction either, its the Minoxidil stopping your skin&#x27;s collagen from being synthesized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve stopped using minoxidil after one month&#x27;s use. I experienced itchy/tired eyes, dark circles under eyes, red swollen ears, and wrinkles on my face from side sleeping (which has been happening for the past two weeks) I had intended to take minoxidil as a preventative measure against hair loss (I&#x27;m 24 and have a very strong almost child like hairline) but minoxidil is just not worth it because it will make you look old. I&#x27;m lucky to have caught this early and will be stopping it. I have very smooth skin with no wrinkles and don&#x27;t want minoxidil messing with that. I&#x27;ll look into something more natural for hair preventative maintenance. Hairomega 3 in 1 sounds like a good bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember that although it is applied to the scalp, it also enters your system and systematically ages at a faster rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the damage people suffer to their skin sounds horrible, and it is ,but the damage the makers of this poison and the FDA should be held responsible for,and I mean criminally,is the damage minoxidil does to your vessel walls and your entire vascular system.They have known about these problems since shortly after it was developed for high blood pressure and its use was stopped.The FDA and the makers of this poison also knew and know it has caused the death of people who have used minoxidil.The FDA is a corrupt organization that have for a long time been approving drugs for the open market that have proven in trials to do more harm than good.Whether the people at the FDA have done this for profit or because they did not monitor the trials as they were paid very well and entrusted to do and just took the word or manipulated results from the makers these people at the FDA should be extremely punished.Long prison sentences and fines that would bankrupt them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re going to comment and say minoxidil is safe just because you haven&#x27;t experienced anything then you can shut it. You are only damaging yourself while being in denial... Do some research on minoxidil and aging and you will see clinical studies that minoxidil DEPLETES COLLAGEN thus aging you faster. I have just washed my hair to get rid of this mornings dose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> There are a number of Minoxidil products (off brand) other than the main name brand. I am glad Kirkland has developed their own line to compete against the more costly versions.  The shipping turnaround time was excellent after placing the order, the packaging is neat, and the usage format is easy for anyone to follow.  I would highly recommend this product through Amazon to anyone.</li>
    <li> Started using it on my brows at the end of February, and by June they looked much better. Sparse scraggly eyebrows run in my family, but this has definitely helped. I still don&#x27;t have really awesome thick/strong brows like I was hoping for, but I also don&#x27;t have to pencil in bald spots anymore. I applied it daily for the first 4 months, and now use it ~3 times a week for maintenance. At that rate the 3 bottles should last me until roughly 2017.  Also, I&#x27;m a girl and it didn&#x27;t make me grow a beard or anything, so I&#x27;m not sure what all the warnings are about. If you want to try using it to fill out your brows, go for it. Just don&#x27;t wash your entire face with the stuff.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and my hair seems to stay about the same. You need to use it very often or you are back to square one.</li>
    <li> El servicio fue rapido y seguro. El producto es muy bueno y la promocion aun mejor, Yo soy de MEXICO y es dificil encontrar esta marca a pesar de que tambien contamos con COTSCO. Sin embargo gracias a esta web consegui mi producto. Lo recomiendo ampliamente!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best deal I have ever made.  To purchase this product in Toronto it is $47.00 per bottle.  Through Kirkland it is $5.00 a bottle and the mixture is as effective.  it&#x27;s wonderful.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is not a magic potion. Minoxidil does not work overnight. Patience in applying this product is necessary. I&#x27;ve bought a six month supply prior to this recent one, and I thought I could fool myself into thinking that a dose a day is enough. It&#x27;s not. The setbacks are the cost and the itchy, irritated scalp. Ever since generic minoxidil has become so popular I&#x27;ve noticed Rogaine finally dropping their price and giving away deals. However minoxidil is minoxidil and it still costs money no matter what. When the scalp starts itching I rub in coconut oil as the minoxidil dries to relieve the discomfort. Anyhow, the pros outweigh the cons in this case. I suggest this product to anyone with recent hair loss as this product works best on thinning hair and not on dead follicles.</li>
    <li> great product i love this product make your hair grow fast and  healthy so i would tell everyone to buy it</li>
    <li> I actually did not use this product: Minoxidil-5% Extra Strength Hair Regrowth for Men that I bought on Amazon site. The reason for that was that some very important information about the advertised product was not disclosed and I discovered that only when the package arrived.  If only I knew upfront that this product is only applicable to the vertex area of the head I would never buy it.  If anybody is interested why this limitation this is the response from Kirkland customer service: because the product was not tested on front or any parts of a head other than vertex.[[ASIN:B000WWG028 Kirkland Minoxidil 5% Extra Strength for Men - 6 Month Supply]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m over 35yo, and my hair lost more and more as recent two year, from frontline to back. It&#x27;s very bad experience at that time.    I buy this product on this Jun, and it works on me after 2 months as a little tiny hair growing at first.    Those tiny hair still lost about 10~40 per day, yet grows continuingly to beat hair lost rate. I do not know when it reach the balance point.    Since I should use from frontline to back, I use about 1.6L once.    The only side effect of this product I found:    There are a little tiny hair on my face, and front arms.  (I&#x27;m Chinese and normally I have few or tiny hair covered in body. So I noticed this change. Anywhere, man does not care it.)    Thank you for your wonderful product, yet I&#x27;m not sure 15% is better than 5% with some side-effect on long-term users? Please clarify on the website, or send me email.    Charles (from Shanghai, China)</li>
    <li> deeply disappointed ! not working at all, had similar from another source which did very well ! will not buy from this source ever again.</li>
    <li> Better than I expected. Product is updated. Delivery is prompt. Has always been very effective in slowing down thinning of hair.</li>
    <li> dried out scalp and alcohol even started stinging after awhile&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard to use if you are leaving the house because it also makes your head look wet and matted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;noticed zero additional hair growth</li>
    <li> Excellent value for the price. This contains USP minoxidill as found in Rogaine.  Other products claim they have pure minoxidill.</li>
    <li> Got the prodcut in good packaging in time. Great price and product. Would reccomend the buyer. Hope now that it has some positive effects too. Too easy to comment on the results now :)</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m still using it, don&#x27;t see any result yet. but will keep continue to use it. will recommend to friends</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Kirkland Minoxidil, and it&#x27;s a fine product, pretty much equal to Rogaine. Bought at Costco, it comes sealed in a box, though there is no tamper resistant band on the individual bottles inside. Purchased from this seller however, there is neither the box NOR a security band. This is not necessarily a problem and I&#x27;m not accusing anyone of anything, but the reason for these measures is to protect the consumer from diluted or tampered-with products and I feel better with those measures in place. The tradeoff is that this supplier has a low price achieved by buying in bulk and reselling without the consumer packaging.</li>
    <li> I stopped using the product and things became worse. Recently I bought a whole year and definetely I see less shine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past several months, but only about one application per day because of the intractable itching and irritation. I will go back to the 2% solution. I did not see any noticeable results with this product, possibly because I was taking less than the customary amount per day.</li>
    <li> When I began losing my hair around the age of 16, it was no doubt a difficult time.  After a few years of trying to cover it up, shaving my head and wearing hats, I decided to give Kirkland&#x27;s product a try (though I always said I&#x27;d never use any hair regrowth product).  A few weeks into using the product you&#x27;ll definitely start to get discouraged because it seems like nothing is happening.  However, after a little over a month I began to see small hairs growing in and at about 1.5 months they are beginning to darken.  I&#x27;ve been using this product on the top of my head as well as on the frontal areas.  Though its supposedly not for use on frontal baldness, I&#x27;m getting a substantial amount of hair regrowth in the area, almost to the point of reshaping my hairline.    The only downfall to this product is the amount it dries out your scalp.  With twice daily applications, I began to have very bad dandruff and itching after week or two from initial use.  I tried to give my body time to acclimate to this product, but I was forced to buy a Dandruff shampoo, which mostly solved the problem altogether.      All in all, this is a very good product and well worth buying at such a cheap price.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work caused neck and back Paine I used it for a month and had to stop because I could hardly move around.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I am a woman. If you&#x27;re a woman with hair loss/thinning/balding hair, let me tell you that I understand your condition. It&#x27;s bad for balding men, I&#x27;m sure, but it&#x27;s socially acceptable for men to lose their hair. For women, it&#x27;s so embarrassing to admit to yourself that you have male patterned or female patterned baldness. I was always so stressed out about people seeing my bald patches and I went to great lengths to hide them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist recommended I try minoxidil (the 5% because she thought I needed it) to see if I could improve my hair. I purchased this 3 count minoxidil from Kirkland and was beyond excited to try it. I read all the reviews and even the bad ones couldn&#x27;t deter me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I never used it long enough to see if it would actually regrow my hair. You need to put this on your scalp for 4-6 months before you see any hair growth at all. I thought this would be fine but it was far from it. As a woman with already thin hair (obviously since I&#x27;m resorting to this product), it doesn&#x27;t help to have something greasy applied twice a day. I could cover up my bald patches when my hair was clean and fluffed with a dryer, but slicked down with an oily substance? No chance of hiding the patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say whether or not this product works as I never used it for the necessary time. I&#x27;m not a vain person but having my bald spots show makes me very self conscious. This product made me have to display those spots with greasy hair for at least 4 months to get some minor peach fuzz growth. And if you let up your twice a day routine (when travelling or if you just forgot), say goodbye to whatever hairs you were able to grow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just didn&#x27;t seem worth it to me.</li>
    <li> This came for an outstanding low price.  I have been using it for over 6 months and cannot tell any difference compared to brand-name and local retail purchased minoxidil</li>
    <li> My review is based on nearly one year of dedicated usage.  I have purchased this Kirkland Minoxidil 5% for men for that period.  I have also bought Rogaine 5% Minoxidil for that period.  All were the alcohol/glycol/water based products.  IOW, I have swapped between the products.  Since they are both 5% Minoxidil with the same base, I believe my review is valid for them both.  To be fair, this review is based strictly on the performance of the products on my bald spot.  Others may easily and justifiably differ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It DOES grow hair on the vertex of the head as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It requires non-stop habitual application 2 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;It does itch, but not excessively.  It is tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;There is some dandruff, particularly during winter months, but it is very minor and only for short periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;You must use it forever (or as long as you want to keep the hair you grow)&lt;br /&gt;It plateaus; that is, it stimulates hair growth to a specific level and then it almost seems to slow significantly or even stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review:  In my case, the largest and most noticeable growth in hair on my bald spot on the peak of my head occurred in the first 4 months.  The edges delineating the extent of my bald spot began to close in a small amount from all sides.  At the very center of the spot, several hairs suddenly appeared and began to grow quite normally.  Over the rest of the bald spot, fine short light hairs appeared (I&#x27;ll call it &#x27;fuzz&#x27;).  Then, everything seemed to stop.  For nearly 8 additional months, things got no worse nor did they seem to get any better.  That&#x27;s where I am today.  I rarely forget to dose anytime or anywhere.  My 30 day bottles always are emptied within 1 day of their 30 day life so I can&#x27;t blame it on becoming lax.  I haven&#x27;t been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You as a potential buyer needs to decide for yourself.  I think it was and is worth the money and small effort it takes to use it and I, for one, am going to continue to use it.</li>
    <li> i used as directed and seen no results im sure it works differentlly for everyone but my story is that its not worth buying</li>
    <li> Feels the same as Rogaine liquid form, so far I&#x27;m satisfied and it is lot cheaper. Will buy it next time again..</li>
    <li> The product arrives in generic shipping envelope without the manufacturer&#x27;s box or instructions, in UNSEALED bottles that look nothing like the ones pictured on this page.  You simply screw off the cap, and there is your product, without any seal.  There is no way to verify the authenticity of this product.</li>
    <li> Reduces breakage taming fly-aways. Would be a 5 but sometimes leaves hair looking oily if product isn&#x27;t allowed to dry.</li>
    <li> DID NOT WORK AFTER 2 years of use once a day. I ended up shaving my head and look younger. BALD IS IN!</li>
    <li> I love this item, my hair hair has filled in so much, Yes order it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product takes forever to work and in the process stains gray hair yellow.  I recommend using Rogain, it may not stain your hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if Minoxidil will work for me in regrowing hair, but this product is very affordable and was shipped very fast, is easy to use and has caused no problems with irritation or flaking of scalp. Here&#x27;s hoping it grows more hair...</li>
    <li> Very fast shipment, I don&#x27;t think there is a need to choose a faster shipping method. Moreover, when I asked about their policy regarding return/exchange, they replied to me promptly and respectifully.    Tom</li>
    <li> been taking Kirkland Minoxidil-5% 5 months and did see more Hair but after taking Biotin 5000mcg for the last 2 weeks I have and I see more hair on my head.lot of hair that did not grow in years now have color.    read reviews on  Nature&#x27;s Bounty Biotin 5000mcg  on here and [....]</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m in my mid-20s, and the hair on the front half of my scalp has been slowly thinning for a couple years now.  It was getting to the point where I was starting to be self-conscious about it, so I figured I would go ahead and give this stuff a shot.    I&#x27;m glad I did.  Over the past 5 months, my hair really has noticeably thickened.  I even have had people telling me they though I was dying my hair, but really it&#x27;s just that it looks darker &#x27;cause there&#x27;s more of it.    Now, I used it on the front of my scalp, and the box clearly states that Minoxidil is only clinically proven to work on the back of your scalp, but what have you got to lose?  It may or may not work for you, but it worked great for me, and I highly recommend it.    The price is right as well.  Less than $30 for a 6 month supply is a great deal.  And applying it isn&#x27;t nearly the hassle you might imagine.  If you&#x27;re just getting started, you might encounter some slight itchiness of the scalp, or in my case, some serious dandruff.  Do yourself a favor, stick with this stuff.  Use a dandruff shampoo and scrub it into your scalp when you shower, and the dandruff will go away completely in less than a week.    Like I said, 5 months in, much thicker hair, no dandruff or scalp problems, I&#x27;m totally satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have to say I have been skeptical about hair loss products and at 32 was getting ready to picture myself with a shaved head. But I decided to give this product a shot... after only 5 weeks I am starting to see the difference, I heard this doesn&#x27;t work in the forehead bald spots but that was my problem. I can see the new hair growing back already. :-)  Have no oil mess or dandruff issues as other have reported, do see however, my skin kind of peeling off a little but hey I don&#x27;t expect the product to be perfect and as long as I see the results I want I am ok. I am giving this one 5 stars and came back to re-order.</li>
    <li> Been using Minoxidil 5% for years now. I don&#x27;t belong to Costco so this is a great opportunity to get a deep discounted price with out pay a yearly fee.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over 5 years for my receding hairline. And yes I know its not for receding hair but my intention was to stop it from getting worse. For the most part it did and I was happy. About 6 months ago I noticed some short hairs like fuzz growing on the corners of my temples. I had never seen that before but I dismissed it as wishful thinking. A couple of months later it was longer. I showed my wife and she said she saw nothing significant. A month later I showed her and she said wow. I went to my hairdresser who I have been going to for years and without even bringing it up she said, &amp;#34; wow your receding hairline is gone !&amp;#34; So I thought to myself what have I done different ? Same shampoo,same diet, no new medicines, no new nothing that could affect my hair at all I concluded. Then last month by sheer accident I came across an article about a guy real excited he grew two hairs ( I&#x27;m not kidding it was 2 hairs) and had a picture of them on his receding hairline. He said it was due to using retinol cream. I became intrigued because 2 months previous I had ordered on Amazon some retinol moisturizer for the lines on my forehead hoping it would make them less noticeable.  The informative article that followed was written by someone I cant remember other than the 2 hair guy. Keep in mind there was no attempt to sell retinol or sell anything on that page I read. It stated that it was noticed for some people retinol had a side effect of growing hair  ESPECIALLY  when combined with minoxidil. It was thought this happened by retinol&amp;#34;s ability to increase blood flow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I will finish by saying this. First I can&#x27;t stand reviews written by people with wishful thinking which happens alot on Amazon. They see and feel what they want to. They are at best many times  exaggerating the truth.(how many times have you ever seen they state they will update later and they never do ! lol) So here is the real truth ! My receding hair line is not gone completely. It is almost halfway gone. I would say 40%. And there are those somewhat long fuzzy hairs growing in front of that which is long now. I do not know for a fact it was the retinol and the article said SOME people had the side effect. The reason I wrote this was because I remember spending many countless hours looking for anything to help my receding hairline before I finally decided it was hopeless and started using kirkland to hopefully stop it from getting worse. Also for what its worth I do not use the minoxidil everyday but every other day trying to make it last longer.The reason I give Kirkland 5 stars is because they have always had a good price for a great product the entire 5 plus years I have been using it. I hope that helps and good luck! ray333ray2001@yahoo.comompletely. It is almost halfway gone. I would say 40%.

    <li> It worked on my friend&#x27;s hair 100% but in my hair only 50%.</li>
    <li> What a great product! Results can be seen in the first few months of taking it and everyday more of my hair is growing in. Plus the supplier is very fast and easy to work with. I will def. Keep making orders with this good group of people.</li>
    <li> price is right but it really doesn&#x27;t do the job - I would not waste your money on this product</li>
    <li> I have been using this or comparable brands for 25 years. I started using before I had any major hair loss and my hair density has remained the same. If you are already starting to have significant hair loss, I don&#x27;t think this will give you a miracle.</li>
    <li> The product makes your head a bit itchy after I put it on a few times but it has shown some positive results.</li>
    <li> As described - and much cheaper than Rogaine.  Comes in the same type of packaging as the original Rogaine product, three bottles and a single dispenser.</li>
    <li> Did not come with spray nozzle. Came with basic eye dropper. Will not use this company again. Solution is probably okay.</li>
    <li> I was planning to use this product but before buying anything I go through customer reviews. As This product is pharmaceutical, I went through number of research papers. These papers state that Minoxidil works well!! good. But there were some cons of using them. After discontinuation of use, grown hairs disappears. People may grow facial and other body hairs as a side effect. Few may experience allergic reactions (In that case, simply, discontinue the use).&lt;br /&gt;In summery, Minoxidil is proven to grow hairs but there are several cons which you should keep in mind.&lt;br /&gt;People who are losing their hairs at enormous pace and has started becoming bald shall try it. But people who are simply conscious about their hair loss and has not loose much hairs (like me!!), should think twice.</li>
    <li> This is a great price for the product. I have used for about a month and don&#x27;t see changes and didn&#x27;t have any additional hair loss from it. I used the womens version the first 2 months, now using the higher strength. So far so good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using minoxidil for years and have used this brand before. I&#x27;ve not been disappointed and will more often order it from Amazon. I can always depend on you all to save me money!</li>
    <li> Very convenient and good product. Will buy again if product is available  Can receive mailings  Will also recommend value is excellent</li>
    <li> I did not receive the item as shown in this photo. The aplacator I got is junk. I hope the ingredence is what I ordered.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my boyfriend.  he is way may paranoid about being bald than i am and he wanted it for christmas, haha.  it works!  it&#x27;s been about 2 months and there are little hairs growing all along the front hairline (it says don&#x27;t use it there but he did anyways).  it kind of reminds me of spring grass - a little fine &amp; fuzzy at first, and now colored ones are coming in.  i am guessing as he uses it longer that they will become more like normal hair, it seems as though dormant follicles are working again.  also - really, really cheap!!</li>
    <li> The title says it all.  It&#x27;s the exact same active ingredient as Rogaine.  In fact it&#x27;s the exact same thing as Rogaine before Rogaine came out with their foam formula.  The active ingredient is Minoxidil.  The side effects were the same for me for Rogaine and Kirkland or Walgreen&#x27;s version:  itchy scalp, some dandruff, orange stains on pillows.  The first two decreased greatly over time. Using Nizoral shampoo helps with the dandruff and I&#x27;ve read that it&#x27;s the only anti-dandruff shampoo that won&#x27;t increase balding and may actually decrease it.  http://www.amazon.com/Nizoral-A-D-Shampoo-4-oz/dp/B0000Y3CRY/ref&#x3D;pd_sbs_bt_3      If the choice is between going bald or having an itchy scalp, some dandruff and a few pillow stains I think the choice is obvious.</li>
    <li> I have used both this and the rogaine foam for my balding head, and results aside the foam is far better than the liquid. With the foam it does not take very long to dry and so you can wear a hat or go lay down on your pillow after about fifteen minutes, but this stuff is an oily liquid and wont dry out for four hours. If you dont mind having oil on your head than its no big deal, but if you want to go out dont be expecting to put any of this on because somebody might want to touch your head and they will end up with grease all over their hands, gross. As for results, I havent ever seen much either with this or rogaine but I continue to use it because I believe it preserves what hair I have left.</li>
    <li> This product did not work as the directions said it would or should have. It has a strong vinger like smell and left my hair thinner than when I started using it. I was unhappy with the product. The company I ordered from did offer a refund and was very kind. I chose not to because It would cost more than I paid to sent the product back &amp; have the company process a refund.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle.  So far it has not worked.  I try to use it twice a day but it makes your head itch REALLY REALLY REALLY bad.  lol</li>
    <li> Price and product is good. I&#x27;m currently using the product and will continues to do. Beats going to the store for it.</li>
    <li> I convert the 5% to 2% with Ethyl Rubbing Alcohol 70% Simple mix just fill the empty bottle with ethy alcohol and mix with 5% minoxdil and you double your 3 month supply to 6 month supply.</li>
    <li> So far this product is easy to use, and whilst not stopping hair loss completely, it has significantly slowed down the rate of loss</li>
    <li> Not as picture at all the syringe is non functional I would not recommend or buy again not satisfied at all</li>
    <li> There is a black cylindrical top over the cap on the bottle that exists only to make the product look taller.There isn&#x27;t even a recycling symbol on it.   This means energy wasted shipping empty space.    Over the course of your lifetime, which is how long you&#x27;ll need to keep buying it, you will be throwing out hundreds of these plastic things.  Grow hair? maybe. Grow landfills? Guaranteed.</li>
    <li> I have written that this product can be fake but I am sorry. After using it for 2 months my hair started to grow. The first thing I notice is tiny little hairs growing from my head. Sorry again from the dealer  And I recommend this product becouse it is working and cheap</li>
    <li> In the process of using, at 30 days think it is stimulating hair growth.</li>
    <li> I cannot find the liquid at stores anymore. I only see the foam now.  I like the foam sometimes, but prefer the appearance of my hair using the liquid. I only wish they would include the (squirt) spray applicators like they used to.  I never use the droppers for this, but find other uses for them, such as out in the garage. Fortunately I still have quite a few of the old spray caps which I kept when they did come with them, and they fit perfectly on the bottles, which are still the good old standard size.</li>
    <li> itll make ya har grow up thar.</li>
    <li> I use this product on a daily basis.I used to purchase it a local big box store which stopped carrying it. I was pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon&#x27;s menu.</li>
    <li> started to lose hair once I switched to this. purchased bc cheaper, will go back to old product now. word</li>
    <li> This works just as well as the name brand.  Much more affordable too!  Tends to make hair look a little greasy, but better then not having any hair!</li>
    <li> This irritates your scalp and drys your hair out.. So even though it&#x27;s probably increasing growth, your hair looks thinner.  It took three haircuts to undo the damage this crap did to my hair!  It was so dry and fine that I looked worse than I did before I started all of this.  I recommend just going for the actual product in the aerosol container (almost like moose from the 90s).  If you use them properly, the 3 containers (3month supply) lasts somewhere between 6 months and a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am all for generic meds... but this is apparently not somewhere you can skimp.  Also, I got mine with some flimsy plasticy applicator thing (almost seems like a single used dropper) that didn&#x27;t attach to the bottle.  You just had to keep it separate.  It&#x27;s possible that what I got was fake, I have no real way of knowing, I&#x27;m not putting any more money down on it--just in case. Just go with the real stuff, there are way too many bad reviews and horror stories for this garbage.</li>
    <li> I am giving it three stars for the fact that I had a bad reaction and I can&#x27;t tell if it is my allergy or a side affect of the product. I only applied it to the receding line at the front of my hair line. After two months of continual use peach fuz began to grow but as it came in I developed a resistible itch in that area. One day the itch got so unbearable I itched it for 2 seconds and my skin ripped right open. It made my skin very fragile. I learned to control the itching but I developed white heads in the area too so I just gave up on it.</li>
    <li> SINCE THERE IS NO CONTROL AS TO WHERE THIS PRODUCT IS MANUFACTURED, THERE IS NO WAY OF KNOWING HOW EFFECTIVE IT IS. THE ONE I BOUGHT WAS MADE IN ISRAEL, BUT ALSO IS MADE IN AMERICA, CANADA, ITALY AND ELSEWHERE. GIVEN THAT SCENARIO, IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO RATE IT&#x27;S QUALITY. I HOPE THAT ISRAEL HAS A HIGH STANDARD OF QUALITY.</li>
    <li> The Minoxidil-5% Extra Strength Hair Regrowth for Men, 3 Count, 2 Ounce Bottles is exactly as advertised, a great value, and works well for me.</li>
    <li> WTH??!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package I was sent had been opened, marked with ink on the applicator, taped shut again --minus the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully they were good enough to return it.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price</li>
    <li> Merchandise as described, received in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> i tried this product for 5 months,i gave myself a grade 3 haircut the day i started using it and took pics of my balding scalp area, every month ide do the same,haircut, pictures, i found i was getting terrible dandruff wich came with the most terrible iching, then started the rashes, after five months i couldnt stand it any longer and had to stop using it, the picure reults were dissapointing, no difference at all in hair grouth</li>
    <li> It takes a few weeks but have notice the difference</li>
    <li> at this ultra low price, I can afford to have a supply every month!</li>
    <li> Came right on time!  Dropper that came was generic, but I had a rubber topped one from last time.  Save your dropper.</li>
    <li> satisfied will continue with it.</li>
    <li> Been using it for many years  --  still have hair</li>
    <li> Very good products recommended 100%, and I&#x27;m looking at using the positive results</li>
    <li> to be honest.  when I started taking this product I noticed much more shedding and thinning of the hair on my scalp than before using the product.  Oddly enough 180% from my expectations I feel as though my hair has thickened since I ceased using this product.</li>
    <li> Never used this brand,but if it is as advertised,should be good as any I have used in the past-thank you!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately it did nothing for me. I read all the reviews and was so excited to try it. I bought two and nothing. If it worked for others i&#x27;m happy for them but not for me.</li>
    <li> MY DERMATOLOGY RECOMENDED TO USE IT.I FIND A GREAT PRICE IN AMAZON.,BETTER THAN ANY PHARMACY. I&#x27;VE USED THE BRAND ROGAINE  AND THIIS MINOXIDIL 5% GENERIC WORKS AS GOOD AS IT</li>
    <li> This product was sent to me in a plastic envelope with just three UNSEALED loose bottles. You can only assume that the contents of these bottles really contain 5% minoxidil. You actually have no idea what you are putting on your scalp. If the bottles come from Costco unsealed, then you should receive them in a box that is sealed. No product information or applicator was included so there is no way for me to even apply the mystery contents. Please also note that it is not returnable. This was a very BAD and REGRETTABLE purchase for me.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS WELL TO KEEP WHAT YOU HAVE.  THE OUT POINT IS ITS OILY. I STOPPED  USEING IT AND LOST LOTS OF HAIR.  TOO LATE NOW TO USE AGAIN. ONCE U START DONT STOP!  IT DOES WORK.</li>
    <li> The product did not deliver what it promised. I did not love it.  It leaves the area with redness when applied.</li>
    <li> been using it for one month so far...hard to tell for sure its having an effect</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m bald head.  i really want hair   so i bought this product  i hope that my hair is luxuriant hair.  thank</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for almost 3 years now and it really works well for me. It helps as much in the front of my head, as it does in the back. The only downside is that it makes me so unbelievably itchy, I just want to scratch my head all day long.   Still, I recommend this product to anyone thinking about trying it out. Heck, it worked for me- why not work for you too?</li>
    <li> Good quality - does the job.  When I use it it leaves my hair with a wet look where I apply it much like my desired look of using hair gel.  As it dries there is a little bit of hold (but it&#x27;s not like hairspray or gel) there is no sticky residue.  In other reviews I&#x27;ve seen flakiness being mentioned - it does occur sometimes but if not bad in my opinion.</li>
    <li> i have been using it for two months and not a result at all I will not recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> Working on me. After 3months noticeable change is hair. Hope it keeps growing in!!</li>
    <li> worked so good i put it up in a pony tail</li>
    <li> As expected, like lower price</li>
    <li> ;Product did not come boxed.  Three separate bottles with no instructions.</li>
    <li> The item received is not in the box as seen when i ordered. The product itself are not sealed.. I wondered if  insigde the product are legitimate minoxidil solution... So dissapointed again....</li>
    <li> No reason to buy the name brand when this works just as well. Minoxidil isn&#x27;t successful on everyone, but for those who use it &amp; gain some benefit, buying this version makes sense. I put it in a small liquid spray bottle, which makes more sense than the &amp;#34;dropper&amp;#34; applicator they supply. Also consider a homemade mix of this with something called Min-O-Muck, which makes it work even better.</li>
    <li> Love this product,  I see results everyday,  look with more hair,  but what really happens is hair strengthening.  It´s a perfect alternative to top branded versions of minoxidil which are by the way more expensive: don´t pay for the brand, just for the value.</li>
    <li> Alright, this is going to be a little long but I have been using minoxidil 5% as directed for a year now and since they say the best results won&#x27;t be seen until about a year, I&#x27;m finally ready to write a review. First a little background on me...I&#x27;m 25 now and was around 18 when I noticed my hair falling out. However, I started out with pretty thick hair so I didn&#x27;t notice it becoming visibly thinner until I was 21. Hair loss runs in my family and is worse on my dad&#x27;s side. He and both his brother&#x27;s have pattern 5 class 7 balding on the Norwood scale. For anyone who isn&#x27;t familiar with the Norwood scale, that is the worst possible balding. The entire top is hairless and you just have hair on the sides and back of your head. So after watching my hair become thinner and thinner for three years, I started using minoxidil when I was 24. At first I didn&#x27;t like the oiliness that it gave my hair. Like a lot of people have said, it takes a long time to dry (probably about an hour). However, after a few months I started to like the texture of my hair better after the minox had dried than if I just let my hair dry without putting anything in it. And to avoid that hour period where it looks really oily I started using a blow dryer, holding it pretty far from my head just for a few seconds to get it almost dry. The first couple months of using it, it kind of made my head itch sometimes but that never happens anymore and it wasn&#x27;t as bad for me as it apparently is for some people. Another problem I had with it was what I first thought was dandruff but later realized was just the dried minoxidil flaking off my scalp. This can be avoided to some degree by washing your hair everyday but I still get little flakes sometimes. So after two or three weeks I thought I was entering the shedding phase. It never really stopped though and I&#x27;m not sure if I was shedding more than I was before I started using it. My bathroom sink still constantly has hair in and around it. After a month or so of using it I started getting peach fuzz in the front corners and to this day it is still peach fuzz - short, clear and not visible from more than a few inches away. As for my hair everywhere else, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s about the same as when I started using it - maybe a little thinner but maybe a little less thin than it would have been if I hadn&#x27;t been using this stuff. In conclusion, I&#x27;m going to keep using this stuff because I don&#x27;t think it hurts and it makes me feel like I&#x27;m doing something to fight my MPB. I&#x27;ve tried Saw Palmetto supplement, Nioxin and Revivogen shampoo and, as with the minox, I&#x27;m not sure if they make any difference. But kirkland minoxidil is super cheap so even though I haven&#x27;t seen obvious hair regrowth or less shedding, I&#x27;m going to keep using it.of using it I started getting peach fuzz in the front corners and to this day it is still peach fuzz - short, clear and not visible from more than a few inches away. As for my hair everywhere else, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s about the same as when I started using it - maybe a little thinner but maybe a little less thin than it would have been if I hadn&#x27;t been using this stuff. In conclusion, I&#x27;m going to keep using this stuff because I don&#x27;t think it hurts and it makes me feel like I&#x27;m doing something to fight my MPB. I&#x27;ve tried Saw Palmetto supplement, Nioxin and Revivogen shampoo and, as with the minox, I&#x27;m not sure if they make any difference. But kirkland minoxidil is super cheap so even though I haven&#x27;t seen obvious hair regrowth or less shedding, I&#x27;m going to keep using it.</li>
    <li> i have been using these for 3 months now, religiously applying twice a day and it doesnt work. cheap but wont help.</li>
    <li> This product works for me.  With this particular generic brand, I save quite a bit of money.  A very good deal!</li>
    <li> I am a 21 year old male and there is definitely hair loss in my family. I didn&#x27;t think I would lose hair as early as I was (around 20). I figure it was due to stress because I&#x27;m currently attending college and I wasn&#x27;t ready for it. Anyways after I started using this product I saw immediate results within weeks. There definitely some side affects though that you all should be aware about. Within a week of using this product I started having trouble sleeping but it wasn&#x27;t that bad. I also started to get color change in my hair which I wasn&#x27;t expecting. I also feel at times that I am more tired than usual (not entirely sure if its the product or just me). My hair was turning lighter and almost seemed like it was thinning also. The worst part of it all though is the product dries out your scalp a lot and you start getting dandruff which I&#x27;ve never had before trying this product. My advice to you is get this product if your having hair trouble but definitely don&#x27;t overuse it because you will start doubting the product. Anyways, hope this helps! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;PS: Try to use small doses and only do it once in the morning after you get out of the shower or else your scalp will get very dry and itchy all day. Also try to apply the product only around the areas you need it. I will keep using this product, but not as much that the box directs you to apply.</li>
    <li> The price is good and products works ok helping my hair loss slow down, but you MUST use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> It works great for me without side effects. You should use it for at least 6 months while visiting a doctor. I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I think that I have too much hair loss all I got was a greasy scalp and a LOT of preparation time.  I would have loved to have my hair back, I had a little extra money so I tried.  This type of product works differently in each case, I hope if you try it you get the outcome you desire.  Again I think I just needed TOO much regrowth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still basically bald after 6 months of greasy rubbing on my head.  My wife said she could see some short peach fuzz but that is all it ever amounted too.  Just ordered the Oster 76 and a 00000 blade to take care of the pipe dream of ever having hair.  Good luck, but I think you will meet my same fate with this product.</li>
    <li> This item did not come in a sealed cellophane box so hard to know what you are getting as the bottles are not sealed.</li>
    <li> Worked ok for a while  then it started to make my head itch and break out. Had to quite using it</li>
    <li> Been using for 4 yrs from Amazon, only thing that REALLY works to grow hair or way slow down hair loss</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the 5% Rogaine foam for awhile and it works without having side effects for me. I bought the Kirkland&#x27;s brand because it was much cheaper, but after two uses I noticed my heart beating faster than normal, and some chest discomfort. You may be fine taking it, but be very aware of anything different use of this product. I&#x27;m discontinuing use of this and will stick to the Rogaine foam, since I know it works and doesn&#x27;t give me sides.</li>
    <li> I bought the 3 month package thinking that it would probably take that long to figure out if it was working or not. I haven&#x27;t even been through the first bottle (1 month) and I already have a substantial amount of new hair growing. In fact, I noticed the new hair before the &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34; of existing hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, at this price you got nothing to lose (accept more hair). I highly recommend you give it a try.</li>
    <li> Seen lots of baby hairs in my forehead, but I had to stop applying to my scalp because of irritation and itchiness, plus it&#x27;s a lot of work because you have to do this 3 times a day, so I&#x27;ll just try to accept that my hair is receding and that there&#x27;s nothing I can do about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wasted my money by buying 2 packs.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works. I also use Fall Fight shampoo and conditioner made by Fructis, because if your hair if falling out faster than it grows back, you have no gain.</li>
    <li> Well I used it try and grow facial air for a bald spot under my chin.&lt;br /&gt;I have a scare there and hair does not grow.&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks of using it I have some peach fuzz there now.</li>
    <li> Firstly - these came in unsealed bottles and that never leaves you with a great feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried it anyway and my scalp reacted badly so I tossed it.</li>
    <li> it became so runny,,of course I am talking about new minoxidil 5% of Kirkland..besides it really gives my hair dandruff, which is quite odd as I have been using minoxidil 5% for over 7 years now. it was the worth I ever had and never ever try it again.&lt;br /&gt;equate or rogain are both better than this trash.</li>
    <li> I have used Kirkland minoxidil from last 1.5 yrs and for the first 6 months iit worked amazingly and has shown visible results and after i bought the new labled Kirkland minoxidil i faced the hair fall problem again and i don&#x27;t know why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New Kirkland solution doesn&#x27;t work fine may be they might have changed some ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to look for other brand now which works fine not temporarily but permanant.</li>
    <li> My husband likes to use this, and he does not look like he is getting any balder. but I don&#x27;t see a frank reversal of the baldness that was already there.</li>
    <li> Some hair growth but the side effects are too much to bear!</li>
    <li> The results are very slow, so it is hard for me to see much changes or improvements before couple of months at least</li>
    <li> I am a 40 yr old with thinning hair. Used this for 3 months and it did not work for me. I am now back to Rogaine which I stopped using because of price but I guess this is another case of you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I´d like to use this product, my hair is comming back what it was yet, but at leas this is reduncing the loss.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still waiting for my stuff to come in the post....I hope it works for alopecia, lots of stress for the past few months has taken its toll. Reading the reviews gives me hope......Watch this space.&lt;br /&gt;I have read many reviews on this product, most have been positive, obviously side effects vary from person to person. Having experienced alopecia before, and waiting 6 years for my hair to come back, I really can&#x27;t wait to try this.</li>
    <li> same as all the rest! greasy I never had to much luck with this stuff!</li>
    <li> I came back to edit my first preliminary review. It&#x27;s been a little over a month now, just finished the 1st bottle the other day. I also just cut my hair really short. I did a high fade with a #2 on the sides/ lower parts &amp; a #4 on top. I&#x27;m starting to see a fair amount of peach fuzz up top by my frontal hairline. Again, I will continue with the applications &amp; report back again in another month or so...&lt;br /&gt;- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -&lt;br /&gt;Application process with this stuff is pretty simple. You get used to it &amp; get very efficient at applying it very quickly. I started using the dab method to ensure it spreads everywhere instead of trying to squeeze a drop here or there &amp; suddenly there&#x27;s none left, Lol. I&#x27;ve also started putting 1 to 2 drops on my finger &amp; working it in to a patchy part of my beard by one of my jaw lines. I read that facial hair behaves differently than hair on top of your head. Using minoxidil, once facial hair goes terminal, I&#x27;ve read on a beard forum that it&#x27;s permanent and will never fall out/ go back to being noticeably lighter than other beard areas. I&#x27;m excited to see how that goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would advise to shake it up real good. Otherwise you might end up with a dosage where the percentage of the active ingredient is either too low or way too high, thus creating the possibility for skin irritation, advanced shedding, or worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly before &amp; after applications. It&#x27;s also not supposed to be touched by women, especially pregnant women, from what I hear. I also read that it&#x27;s highly toxic to cats. BE CAREFUL!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast S&amp;H from the seller I selected. Very good price. I like the unscented aspect of it &amp; I actually REALLY like the feel of my hair after applications. It&#x27;s got PG (propylene glycol) in it. It&#x27;s good for hair. I&#x27;ve completely stopped using other leave-in conditioners/ styling products &amp; prefer how this leaves my hair.a strip of your scalp off &amp; take out &amp; insert the hairs into your frontal hairline one by one costs ~$10,000. Do the math. Also compare this particular generic Rogaine to other generics, which are around the same price, maybe $5 more per 3 month supply. $10,000 would buy 166 years worth of generic Rogaine, hahaha!!! ;D    A lot of people all over the internet in lots of different forums have complained about an oily feel/ texture. I, for one, really like this particular aspect of the application. I&#x27;ve been using different types of leave-in conditioner mixed with a tad of water to help keep my hair moist during the day, My hair gets really dry &amp; I don&#x27;t like that fuzzy, dry look on me. The last type of hair product I used before stopping it right before the minoxidil had propylene glycol in it. In small amounts, it can be really good for hair. It acts as a humectant which helps attract &amp; seal in moisture to your hair strand &amp; I guess the follicle. This specific kind of generic minoxidil has PG in it as one of the inactive ingredients. I actually prefer using this to what I was using before in terms of using a hair product to style my hair/ after a shower, etc. I&#x27;ll usually leave it as-is for an hour then kinda run my knuckles through my hair to brush out that wet shell look.    Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly before &amp; after applications. It&#x27;s also not supposed to be touched by women, especially pregnant women, from what I hear. I also read that it&#x27;s highly toxic to cats. BE CAREFUL!!!    So, I will continue using it twice daily and report back in several weeks.</li>
    <li> It was what i needed and expected for a for the money It worked great with everything and it was packed and shipped on time</li>
    <li> This product seemed a cheaper alternative to Rogaine for me, but it did not work (after almost one year). At least with Rogaine my hair had stopped falling. It continued to fall with this product.</li>
    <li> This does work but you have to be patient.  I use this twice a day.  I can&#x27;t use the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; foam that Kirland came out with so I was very happy to find this with Amazon.  It says it&#x27;s for men but I&#x27;m a women and have used this for a year at a time when my hair fell out because of stress.  It really thickens up my hair.  The only thing is you have to be patient.  I see the growth steadily.  I also take a lot of Biotin.  Biotin alone didn&#x27;t make my hair grow back.  It helped with keeping what I already had.&lt;br /&gt;With Minoxidil it grows as well!!  Use sparingly.  Putting more on doesn&#x27;t make a difference.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to re-grow my eyebrows. This product works but takes about 6 weeks before any hair growth and you must use it twice daily.</li>
    <li> So glad I can get liquid.  The foam is terrible.</li>
    <li> Alright. If you&#x27;re like me you&#x27;ve bought this item because it helps &#x27;cure&#x27; M.P.B. I have had alopecia areata since the ripe age of 13 and boy have a I suffered. Tried a lot of things, but finally submitted to my dermatologist prescribing this. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month now, and I have noticed hair growth, but I&#x27;m not sure if this is just the alopecia retreating in that one particular section. So, I began using it on my under beard that also suffers from alopecia. I&#x27;m noticing hairs growing after 1 month, so I&#x27;m hoping more hair will grow.&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;m a black guy, so I&#x27;m not sure how this product varies with different races. Some of my side affects might not apply to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple things I want to point out about this specific item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) It looks nothing like the one in the picture&lt;br /&gt;2.) It itches after applying - mild to unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;3.) Skin will flake, and by that I mean you itch it and skins comes off - not noticeable by people you just see it on your fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;4.) The application thingy is some cheap plastic dropper. Looks like the ones I used in earth science in Middle School.</li>
    <li> It really helped my hair grow.</li>
    <li> I have been using generic minoxidil 5% from various suppliers for years. Recently, I ordered the 4-month package supplied by Kirkland. Guess what, after a month, my hair started to fall again. Although on the label, it is 5% minoxidil, there&#x27;s no way for me to test whether it has 5% minoxidil or not... So I stopped using this one and quickly ordered another generic minoxidil from a different supplier and my hair loss seems slow down now. So conclusion: I will never buy minoxidil from Kirkland anymore.</li>
    <li> Received the purchased item very expeditiously but I thought a dropper applicator would have been enclosed. Without this, it&#x27;s rather very difficult to apply the Minoxidil to the scalp.</li>
    <li> i started using this about 6 years ago and it brings very positive results... i recommend it highly.  easy to use</li>
    <li> Seems to be working...</li>
    <li> Used one bottle and see eyebrow growth;actually went to get a wax job with no gaps. So far, no adverse masculinizing effects.</li>
    <li> Great product all around</li>
    <li> Works great + 10000 mcg Biotin</li>
    <li> Did not come in box, so no way to know if genuine. Unacceptable.</li>
    <li> In my mid 20&#x27;s, my hairline was noticeably starting to thin and recede in the front...so I started trying various shampoos and remedies, which didn&#x27;t really do much to resolve the problem. Finally, I came across this product, which works for me. (Thank You, God!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal Use:&lt;br /&gt;- I use the dropper that comes with the product to apply it once a day before bed.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s not that messy to apply - if a drip or two goes down my forehead then I just wipe it off.&lt;br /&gt;- Would not recommend for use before going out of the house (hair would look wet/shiny).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal Results:&lt;br /&gt;- 2-3 months of use: Some of the current results were evident.&lt;br /&gt;- 6 months of use: Positive results self-evident. (Used about about 1.25 of the 3 bottles that came with the kit within 6 months)&lt;br /&gt;- 7-8 months of use: Progress seemed to slow down, maybe even stop/revert slightly, but ultimately the product kept working with a single daily application.&lt;br /&gt;- 9 months of use: Hairline restoration progress sustained and slowly continues.&lt;br /&gt;- 10 months of use: Struggling to maintain reclaimed ground/some thinning in areas of prior progress. There has been some itchiness and dry scalp. Currently on 3rd bottle - still going to reorder. Going to start combining with a secondary hair loss product/DHT blocker again (My previous hair gel had a DHT blocker in it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Synopsis of effectiveness: At the site of product application (frontal receding hairline), fine hair has become thicker, hairline has stopped receding, shedding has reduced, and hairline has reclaimed some ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hypothesis regarding positive results:&lt;br /&gt;- Believe product implementation was applied early enough in the balding process to counteract and restore receding hairline. (i.e. It was still possible to rejuvenate the troubled hair follicles)</li>
    <li> Bought this item for my husband and he&#x27;s been faithfully using it twice a day for 3.5 months I see NO Difference at all plus I been saving photos 2 compare.bottles don&#x27;t have protection seals on them either.so I&#x27;m wondering what&#x27;s really in it.? Does not work . waste of $ and time..I would like 2 put minus stars if there was a option 4 it...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a female getting older. In my younger years I had a lot of my eyebrows removed by electrolysis. I saw on YouTube that if you used this on your brows twice a day, they would grow back. A lot of them did! I thought I had lost my brows forever. Great price too! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> First of all,I&#x27;m 61yrs old and maybe it&#x27;s already too late to realistically believe I can re-grow some of my hair.Also,I don&#x27;t know if this stuff is keeping me from losing more.I also take a statin drug which I heard can cause some hair loss so I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m losing or gaining or just holding my own.You&#x27;ll have to judge for yourself.</li>
    <li> I am 49 years old male and after 3 months no noticeable growth. I still have hair but it&#x27;s thinning on the front hair line and has receded about a half an inch over the years. Maybe this product will slow down the hair loss but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever see hair growth at my age. Great price for the product and I have not experienced any side effects.</li>
    <li> Very inexpensive. Well made and easy to use. almost out time to  reorder. Just when you think you have seen it  all.</li>
    <li> not safe to use, no seal, seller told me they open the packs. Seems to me that they open the packs to make a profit off of the other things in the kit.</li>
    <li> The price is perfect. Why dont you make it in spray canister for a more even and more convenient application?</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say that it worked because I was unable to use it to the fullest.  I am allergic to something inside the ingredients.  I believe it&#x27;s the alcohol used in the mixture.  It dried my scale up and made me itch like crazy. Unfortunately, I tried several other products but they all use the same alcohol ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are allergic to rogaine, don&#x27;t use this one - it has the same ingredient.</li>
    <li> i chose this product because it is good product for slight degrees of hair loss patterns. without serious side effects . i recommend it for mild hair loss patterns . thanks a lot</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m old enough to be resigned to hair loss, but some time ago I gave way to vanity and thought I would try to see if I could repair my bald patch.  My hairdresser said that there was some regrowth after a month or so, but by then the damage to my scalp (raw places and scabs) was so severe that I stopped the treatment.  More recently I had two small alopecia spots, for which minoxidil is recommended, so thought I would risk it.  Great mistake:  after 3 applications the entire back of my neck and lower scalp itched terribly.  I&#x27;m sure this is just a personal reaction  -  it evidently works for other people.  But I emptied my bottles down the drain.</li>
    <li> used for a while noticed some tiny hair growth on my receding hair line but once you stop using it say good bye lol. takes a while to start seeing results probably like 2 or 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> What can I say about a product that &amp;#34;might&amp;#34; grow hair depending on the person?  For me, I think it&#x27;s working, but that isn&#x27;t really what I&#x27;m rating.  I&#x27;ve tried Rogaine before and it seemed to work, so I decided to try this much cheaper version from Kirkland.  It&#x27;s not like you are going to instantly have a full head of hair, but over months of use, you should notice that bald spot in the back of your head starting to close up - that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s really targetted for although why not try it on your whole head if you need it.  If you don&#x27;t grow hair then it&#x27;s probably not the fault of the product - it doesn&#x27;t work for everybody.  This stuff is exactly like Rogaine from what I can tell, at a much lower price, and seems to be having a similar effect for me. I give it five stars since it&#x27;s a great way to see if Monoxidil will work for you at a much lower price point to Rogaine. It&#x27;s a waste to buy a single bottle since you need to do this everyday for at least three months!</li>
    <li> Item arrived as described.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Excellent seller , very fast shipping , Item as described , Thanks! ♥~♥♥~♥♥~♥</li>
    <li> this is one third the price of &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; romaine. As far as I can tell,it works,so I&#x27;d be a fool to buy Rogaine. I am a regular purchaser of this. By the way, I am not bald, but age-related thinning is occurring. This seems to have halted it or at least slowed the process down.</li>
    <li> still now i don&#x27;t know the effect of the stuff. but looks like good. ^^&lt;br /&gt;well, it would be better to give 1 more pump(?).</li>
    <li> I started using this product three years ago.  It did help thicken my hair.  I experienced scalp itchiness, and gradually noticed flaking like dandruff. At first, I thought the flakiness was just the minoxidil.  The flakiness continued to get worse.  After 18 months I had to quit the minoxidil, as the dandruff condition was serious, and it continued after I had quit the minoxidil.  I tried many medications to cure the problem.  After about six months I got the flakiness under control.  I then tried to start applying minoxidil again, but my scalp was allergic to it and  it led to flakiness after only two days of application.  Finally, I diluted the 5% solution with water and alcohol to get it down to a 1% solution, and my scalp tolerated that.  After a few more months went by, I was able to return to the 5% solution.  During that interim period I lost a lot of hair.  I have been back on full strength for two months, and my hair is starting to thicken again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I have learned is this.  Please pay attention, and this will save you the grief that I went through.  1) Your scalp should not itch with this stuff.  2) If you see flakiness, that is your scalp with the beginning of dandruff. 3) You need to thoroughly shampoo EVERY DAY, with 3-5 minutes of gentle scrubbing with your finger nails.  This stuff is resistant against washing out of your scalp, and you MUST shampoo down to bare, clean scalp skin every day.  If  you don&#x27;t take this care, the stuff will build up on your scalp, cause itchiness and cause dandruff because a fungus condition will start to grow under the layer of dry minoxidil.  My scalp DOES NOT itch, nor should yours if you exercise proper scalp cleaning every day. Nor should there be any flaking. The product at full strength now works fine for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the UK and have been using Kirkland Minoxidil now for six months - not bald but had started to go a bit thin - and I have to say I am extremely pleased with the results. You do need to keep using the product though - you won&#x27;t see results overnight. By the third month I noticed a new wave of hair coming through and by the fourth month many other people were pointing out the noticeable difference in growth. Plus the price on this product is great - really affordable although shoppers in Europe might want to get it on a European site like kirklandminoxidil.co.uk to avoid the waits and customs charges! Six months later and my hair has continued to get thicker and thicker since - when it is going to stop growing who knows!</li>
    <li> BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR OVER 10 YEARS</li>
    <li> I put this on my receding hairline religiously for 4 months.  I saw a few hairs starting to sprout, but it was negligible.  Maybe I&#x27;m paranoid, but it seems like once I stopped using this product my hairline got thinner.  I don&#x27;t blame this company though.  This product is not intended for receding hair lines.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works, its important to make a effort I use it twice a day about 5 days a week. This is my second round and I see a difference.</li>
    <li> first off and will be very brief and get to the point.&lt;br /&gt;1. do not buy if you want it to fix hair line- it is only designed to work for the back of head (vertex)&lt;br /&gt;2. it didnt work for me and used it faithfully as instructions showed&lt;br /&gt;3. leves white cracks in head and made scalp look an ADDTIONAL 20 YEARS OLDER ITS WRINKLY&lt;br /&gt;4. ROGAIN WORKED MUCH BETTER ITS A LITTLE MORE EXPENSIVE BUT IT AT LEAST WORKS PROPERLY AND REGROWS HAIR AND NOT JUST FOR ONE SPECIFIC SPOT</li>
    <li> Great product and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s similar strength to the one that I used before but a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for me after 2 months.</li>
    <li> Real product at a real good price.</li>
    <li> hard to tell if this type of product actually works!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy the name brands. They are a rip-off. Do yourself a favor and buy this brand. It is the same formula, and creates the same results. In fact, for those of you who do not know this; any drug developed in generic form must contain the EXACT ingredients of the original manufacturing process. This means that when you buy those dollar stores Advil&#x27;s, and claim they don&#x27;t work; that is all in the mind. We often create our own perceptions and outcomes. Keeping that in mind for a moment, check out the reviews, and decide for yourself. I am not one of the naive idiots who review something based on knowledge they read on the box only. This is from personal experience ranging from more than 2 years of off an on use.  Questions? Just ask.</li>
    <li> cannot beat the price, have used for years, seems to help hair but wish there was something stronger but equal to non generic minoxidil</li>
    <li> I really hate it. I just received the items but not exactly the same in what you see in the picture and no box.</li>
    <li> Who knows if it works or not... but for this low price... it is better than doing nothing.  Just worrying less about your hair falling out....&lt;br /&gt;should keep it on your head... a bit longer.  HEAR that HAIR !!!  Good, now stay where you belong.  Never an itch or even tingle.&lt;br /&gt;No different than putting holy water on your head.  People who react to this... must have an awfully sensitive scalp.  If on your hands,&lt;br /&gt;and you place your hand near your lips.... it tastes awful.  Sure wouldn&#x27;t want it to get in my eyes... but I&#x27;m sure they thought of that too...&lt;br /&gt;and would be plenty safe.... as it has been government approved. Apparently they proved to the gov that the stuff actually does work... too !!&lt;br /&gt;As far as growing new hair on an existing bald head.... I&#x27;d be skeptical of that....  especially on the front part of the scalp.  Might work on&lt;br /&gt;the back bald spot that most men have... but what I can&#x27;t see... doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> Minoxidil was first developed as an anti-hypertensive, and then the side effect of gair growth was noted.  It can drop blood pressure, hence side effects like dizziness or weakness for some people.  This stength is supposed to be for men because of the potential side effect of facial hair growth.  I am a niddle aged woman,  I was born bald, and have had thin, silky hair all my life since I grew hair.  As it began to get even thinner in middle age, I began using generic minoxidil with good effect. I have used it off and on for over 10 years.&lt;br /&gt; I use the 5% now, and I  have the thickest hair that I have ever had in my life.  It is such a pleasure!&lt;br /&gt;Once I did grow pale blond fuzz on my cheeks.  I actually thought it was hysterically funny since I totally love monkeys and was starting to look like one.  I used Sally Hansen facial hair removal gel once and it has not returned,  I also do use it at the front of my hair line.  That also is the thickest ever.  My hairline eventually began to lower as the hair reclaimed the top of my forehead,  so I used that gel to create a shapely hairline.  Both of my sisters have very thin hair, and usually the women in my family go bald by old age.  I have a thick head of hair and am very happy about it.  :  )</li>
    <li> Minoxidil works, as it&#x27;s currently the only topical drug used in a randomized clinical trail and has shown benefit [...]. It has some side effects [...] but really it&#x27;s very easy to use and the main problem of headache which I got went away in a couple of weeks. Nothing too serious. It usually would happen when I would use two doses close to each other or just right after each other, which is not what is advised anyway. I started using when I noticed hair falling at about the age of 27, so I didn&#x27;t have any balding. And I recommend every man who has some balding in the family, or not, use this. Think of it as brushing your teeth, not some medicine. It keeps the hair much better and fuller. God for both men and women at this 5% concentration. Some studies have shown women to show a better response to the 5% than the 2% so why not use this?</li>
    <li> Well we all know were taking a chance and dealing with percentages when trying these products i have been using it for two months and gave two months of it to my friend. He has had excellent result his hair is growing in the crown as well as in the front. I on the other hand only needed it for the front and though i have seen some results they have not been as great as my friends. So i give it 4 stars only because i want my hair to darn it not my friends. LOL.</li>
    <li> This one is real product. It works on my head. I love it.</li>
    <li> When I bought this stuff, I was a freakish, hairless monstrosity, now my whole body is completely covered in hair. I look like a gigantic pile of wigs! This is not what I wanted! But if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, it may work for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Kirkland Minoxidil 5% (for men) for over 5 years.  There has clearly been a change in the bottle cap.  The last 3 packages I bought have pitted me against the bottle cap. Even though I have above-average grip strength, I have struggled mightily to unscrew the bottle caps on 18 consecutive bottles.  What&#x27;s going on, Kirkland?  Are you now marketing your product to King Kong?</li>
    <li> Enjoyed this product. I&#x27;ve used it for years and have recommended it to friends. I&#x27;ll continue to use this same product.</li>
    <li> i used this for about a month then it gave me a burn/rash on my forehead along with hives/pimples near my eyes. this stuff iches like hell i ended up scraching my head so much that i lost even more hair now i look even worst than before. i have 2 brand new bottles that i cant use now. this stuff is not for everyone i recomend you buy a one month supply and see how it goes. p.s i only used it on the crown of my head.... @L3x357</li>
    <li> I have review the value of the purchase which is awesome. The effectiveness has to be monitored. It is very easy to use and apply to specific areas and thus less waste.</li>
    <li> This product does work for most IF you give it time. I did not see results for well over two months, but it finally did the trick! You MUST keep using this product in order to maintain new hair growth. As other name brand products can cost substantially more, this brand is a money saving alternative and will do exactly the same thing.....believe me ..I know!</li>
    <li> Good product seeing results after 60 days thanks</li>
    <li> So i have patchy chest hair.  I decided to do something about it, and ordered a 6 month supply of this stuff.  I would say that i managed to fill in half the area that i wanted to fill in, and since i don&#x27;t suffer from hair loss the results stay even after i stopped applying the product.  I think i might order another 6 month supply to try to fill in what&#x27;s left of the gaps.  The only negative is that i did start growing a little more body hair in areas close to where i was applying, but i don&#x27;t really mind.</li>
    <li> Three bottles came out of retail box (not as pictured on the attached image). The individual bottles look different from the picture. No standard screw on dropper is enclosed (the disposable plastic dropper that was sent is useless. I have doubts about the authenticity of the product. The description of the product on the web site is misleading.</li>
    <li> Perfect and good price.</li>
    <li> I use it every morning and I don&#x27;t think your hair really regrows, but it does work to keep what hair you have and a thicker head of hair.</li>
    <li> Gave me a headache. Used it for facial hair growth. Helped my moutache grow a little more. Helped the hairs on the side of my face grow a little more. Worsened my ance though. AND found out if it comes into contact with a cat it will kill them. I love my cat so it had to go.</li>
    <li> Such a savings, compared to purchasing in stores.  This is the second time I have purchased a multi-pack.  Will again, if available, when this runs out.</li>
    <li> So much for the money! Just as good as rogaine. Good off-label use if to grow out overplucked eyebrows and apply with qtip. just don&#x27;t let it get in eyes!</li>
    <li> Use as directed as you will see results!&lt;br /&gt;This is the second shipment of this product and I have been very pleased with results thus far.</li>
    <li> This product does work. I have been using the bottles for a few months, every day, and my hair grew back slightly. Then I paired this product up with Nizoral shampoo (as the internet had told me to do) and it grew back slightly faster and healthier. I&#x27;m not totally bald, but I could see my age creeping up on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minoxidil, thanks for enabling my mid life denial!</li>
