<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Our dentist recommended this product years ago, and we have been using it ever since.  It worked better than products designed for sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> Use it everyday. Just make sure to rinse after brushing and don&#x27;t leave the toothpaste for too long in your mouth as it can have a bit of a drying effect.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this toothpaste several years ago, but since then, stores have stopped carrying it. They still have whitening and peroxide formulas, but those weaken teeth [according to my dentist].    I never used the different formula that some reviewers refer to and miss. But this product is great. It makes my breath fresh and my mouth feel cleaner, longer than other toothpastes do. I tried switching to another brand when I could no longer buy this locally, but it&#x27;s just not the same.    I realize that I sound like an ad, but I really like this product. I would be greatly disappointed if I could no longer get it anywhere. It&#x27;s bad enough that I now have to order it off the Internet.</li>
    <li> excellent product...only toothpaste I use...our local stores were out and I decided to check amazon...they had it.</li>
    <li> Got this as a xmas gift from crazy in-laws (wonder if they&#x27;re trying to tell me something)... but I actually like it!  Can&#x27;t complain about free toothpaste! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I have used A&amp;H toothpaste since it came out. Back when it was in the white tube with red and blue print and they made only one kind. Those were the good old days. Today, I have to study the multiple different boxes for long periods of time just to try to find my beloved baking soda only toothpaste.  I mean, how many different ways can you package baking soda and peroxide and call it a different, better, greater product?? I can&#x27;t even find the basic baking soda only toothpaste locally anywhere. I can&#x27;t abide the peroxide taste and how it foams up in my mouth. So, though I may be crazy, I bought all these 6 tubes and paid close to 25.00 for toothpaste just to get my Plain Jane toothpaste. I&#x27;ll probably never use 6 tubes of toothpaste before I die of old age. But I could not find a single tube or a pack of less than 6 of this on Amazon that was not an outrageous price.  Please, God, don&#x27;t discontinue this kind!  OK, I&#x27;m stepping off my soap (toothpaste) box now.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t buy this in the store anymore, and this is the ONLY one without whitening (which is what our dentist recommended).</li>
    <li> I just bought this toothpaste at my local Publix. The Ingredients read as followed: Sodium flouride, sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), water, glycerin, sodium saccharin, PEG-8, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, flavor, cellulose gum, sodium lauryl sulfate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no peroxide in this particular toothpaste so whoever is reviewing this toothpaste and saying it gave them an allergic reaction is reviewing the wrong product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste tastes good and leaves my mouth feeling clean and doesn&#x27;t leave any minty taste in my mouth. I like it. It&#x27;s my first time using Arm &amp; Hammer. I have not had an allergic reaction to this toothpaste and I am a very sensitive person in general (I can&#x27;t even use cinnamon toothpaste because it makes my lips crack and bleed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have no complaints with this toothpaste. If anything arises and I get a weird reaction I will update this review ASAP.</li>
    <li> You know how the flavor of Coke is different in different countries?  The flavors of toothpaste differ a lot more.  The flavor of a standard tube of Colgate in Italy is much mintier than in the USA (I think that Italy and Greece share the same flavor).  To Italians, most kinds of toothpaste in the USA taste bland, or worse (my mother once commented that my toothpaste tasted like fish).   The flavor of Dental Care is closer to that of typical Italian toothpaste than any other north-American toothpaste I have tried.  So it&#x27;s no surprise that I like it.  Lately it&#x27;s become hard to find in stores, so I am glad that Amazon is carrying it and I hope it&#x27;s not going to end up like Kodachrome.</li>
    <li> I too suffered mouth sores after using this toothpaste in the gold box.  My tongue had sores all over it.  My lip swelled badly.  They really should take this off the market.  I did not realize the toothpaste was the source of my problem and continued to use it thinking even though it was burning, I needed to brush my teeth because I did not want cavities along with all my other issues.   After a few days the burning while brushing was so bad, I decided to switch toothpaste.  After I switched, the sores slowly started to get better.  Once they were all gone and not realizing that the toothpaste was the source of my problem, I went back to using the Arm &amp; Hammer.  This time I caught on quickly that it was the toothpaste that was causing the sores because I got the sore back after one use.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few toothpastes that I truly like. Most that I have tried feel like they coat my teeth somehow. Dental Care not only leaves your mouth feeling absolutely clean, but your mouth is clean in appearance. I do not experience any baking soda aftertaste as one might expect with such a high concentration of baking soda. As for the breath I do not have a clue since I always rinse with Listerine. The crazy thing is that this toothpaste was everywhere years ago and now I do not see it in any store. For five stars it would have to magically appear in my medicine cabinet free of charge.</li>
    <li> I just love the saltiness of baking soda.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviewers that all the Arm &amp; Hammer changes to their toothpaste formulas and packaging is confusing and frustrating - they shouldn&#x27;t change a good product that customers like to use.  However, this one seems pretty decent, and I didn&#x27;t experience any allergic reactions. (I don&#x27;t have any allergies except to chocolate, which gives me canker sores)  I actually use this baking soda toothpaste to reduce the canker sores I get occasionally.  I guess baking soda makes the mouth less acidic, which seems to help.  Maybe they&#x27;ve changed to ingredients again or the other fellow listing the ingredients had a different product, but this one contains the following ingredients:  Sodium fluoride, sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), water, glycerin, sodium saccharin, PEG-8, flavor, cellulose gum, sodium lauryl sulfate, and sodium lauroyl sarcosinate.</li>
    <li> I looked all over the place for this toothpaste. I do not know why the company does not place this version of product on the shelves.  Whitening versions are all that I can find and 5 or 6 types of Arm and Hammer Whitening toothpastes.    I cannot stand any of the other brands of toothpaste. Crest ect. they all taste like soap to me.    Thank you Amazon for carrying this formulation.    I am on my second case of 6.</li>
    <li> For the past two years, I have been going through a battery of tests to figure out the source of my never ending mouth sores.  I&#x27;ve used Arm N Hammer toothpaste, laundry detergent, and deodorant for years.   I specifically chose Arm n Hammer products because they didn&#x27;t have all that extra poison in them.  It never occurred to me that the toothpaste was the source of my problems.     I didn&#x27;t change toothpaste, my toothpaste changed.      My doctor has been stumped, ordering blood tests done to see if I have an auto immune disorder, like Lupus or Rheumatoid arthritis.       I came upon the reviews of what people have been saying about this toothpaste, and put it all together.  Once I stopped using the Arm N Hammer Toothpaste my sores instantly went away.    This toothpaste has been the source of thousands of dollars of unnecessary medical expenses.   I will never use Arm N Hammer products again.      I have been miserable because of these product changes.  The box redesign was absolutely a terrible idea.  Who wrecked this company?</li>
    <li> This toothpaste recommended by our dentist for over 15 years is hard to find in our area. Even with shipping, the cost was lower than when our store did have it in stock.</li>
    <li> I used to use this product a couple of years ago and it worked wonders by whitening my teeth after every brushing, I recently repurchased the product and have used it for the last 6 months. About 3 months ago I started to get extremely dry lips and redness around my lips along with it being painful to open my mouth. Even talking made my lips crack open and bleed. I went to the dentist a week ago who said that it could be due to weather changes but said to maybe try a different toothpaste as whitening toothpastes can sometimes be too harsh. I switched over to Colgate and my immediately the cracks on the corners of my mouth disappeared. It&#x27;s been 7 days and there is still redness around the area but it is no longer painful and is gradually going away. I wish I would have found out this was the cause of my cracked lips and irritation sooner! I don&#x27;t have any history of allergies and my skin is not sensitive,this product is way too harsh!</li>
    <li> First, I just want to say this is a great toothpaste.  My gums have never felt healthier.  I am a daily flosser and twice a day brusher.  My genes have not been that good in the teeth department, but I try to defeat the odds anyway :)  The only 2 flaws with this toothpaste (which I expected, considering the ingredients) is that the toothpaste is salty tasting and a bit pricey.  I can, however, save big $ by buying in bulk on amazon...although it is still pricier than crest.  :(</li>
    <li> great for dental care</li>
    <li> Interesting that Amazon would simply make a new page for a product when several people complain about health issues resulting from that (this!) product&#x27;s use.  See [[ASIN:B000FKHKL2 Arm &amp; Hammer Dental Care Fluoride Toothpaste, Advance Cleaning, Maximum Strength, Fresh Mint 6.3 oz (178 g) (Pack of 6)]]    I&#x27;ll repeat my review from last year here, as the ingredients HAVE NOT CHANGED and people continue to suffer after using this toothpaste.    &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  The original white box (UPC code 0332001183709 for the 6.3oz tube) worked wonders for a fresh mouth/breath and clean teeth for my husband - who has many allergies. The white box Dental Care was his favorite, as he could use it without effect. Then, as all marketers seem to do, Arm &amp; Hammer changed their formula for a \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; \\&quot;fresh mint\\&quot; flavored (in the gold box) toothpaste. My husband cannot use the new formula, as it makes his tongue swell up and gives his entire (inner and outer) mouth area a severe &#x27;burning&#x27; reaction - which leaves him looking (literally) like a clown with a huge red area encircling his mouth and the three inches surrounding his mouth - for four to five days after use.    Old formula: sodium flouride, sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), water, glycerin, sodium saccharin, PEG-8, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, flavor, cellulose gum, sodium lauryl sulfate    New formula: sodium flouride, sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), PEG-8, PEG/PPG-116/66 copolymer, sodium carbonate peroxide, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, silica, sodium saccharin, flavor, water, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate    What&#x27;s new?  [a] PEG/PPG-116/66 copolymer (not used in ANY other toothpaste, per the Cosmetics Database),  [b] sodium carbonate peroxide (used in OxiClean and deck cleaner - not used in ANY other toothpaste, per the Household Products lists within the National Library of Medicince at the National Institute of Health..., used in Crest Night Effects whitening system per the Cosmetics Database),  [c] tetra sodium pyrophosphate (tartar control),  [d] silica (sand)    I find these new ingredients make me anxious about using the product.    I can only hope Arm &amp; Hammer will follow CocaCola&#x27;s path (and drop the &#x27;new&#x27; product and go back to the &#x27;old original&#x27;). If not, Arm &amp; Hammer has lost my faith and business (our entire household uses the detergent, toothpaste, etc that hubby/dad/grandpa can tolerate.)</li>
    <li> white teeth and fresh breath</li>
    <li> This made my mouth really sore after about a week or so of using it.  I lost my sense of taste - esp salt taste.  I stopped using it because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the cause or not.  Several months later - I grabbed the tube again and this time after ONE use I had loss of taste and I very irritated tongue!!!!!!  It has been over a week and I still have not regained my taste back completely!  Its horrible!</li>
    <li> great to finally find a toothpaste WITHOUT peroxide. Arm &amp; Hammer has finally done something right. Peroxide should NEVER be in a toothpaste. This toothpaste really cleans teeth &amp; freshens breath.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is a little pricey but it is definitely worth every penny (I subscribe and save to make it cost efficient). There is no oral clean feeling like that after using baking soda and this toothpaste is loaded with it.  You will get the squeaky clean feeling on your teeth and it easily eliminates bad breath.  Many other toothpaste brands incorporate baking soda into their toothpaste, but it typically has a just a hint of baking soda flavor/taste. Well, unlike those brands, this toothpaste has a very bold baking soda taste.  I am a repeat buyer of this product and I will continue to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI:  I am a huge fan of the arm and hammer brand, so if you are unsure about the maximum baking soda content (and bold taste) in this product I do recommend that you try any of the arm &amp; hammer toothpastes.</li>
    <li> I have purchsed the new Arm and Hammer Dental Care toothpaste, and after 3 days my lips cracked, swelled and mouth became extremely dry and some swelling of the tongue.  This is a dangerouse product as my reaction was severe enough to get a prescription for Epipen.  Updating or improving a product and cutting corners alwasys cause the public to not trust the Brand anymore.</li>
    <li> BEST. Toothpaste. EVER.</li>
    <li> ... And still the BEST!  The reviewers with allergic reactions are referring to a different product: Arm &amp; Hammer Advance White with peroxide.  This is Arm &amp; Hammer Dental Care - Advance Cleaning.  It is the same product as the former white tube, with the exception of the amount of sodium lauryl sarcosinate being reduced to being the smallest ingredient by weight.  The names of the Arm &amp; Hammer toothpastes are very confusing, and this original formulation has gotten hard to find.</li>
    <li> The best toothpaste on the market without all the extra &#x27;stuff&#x27; that causes gum problems for sensitive/allergic people.</li>
    <li> The original Arm &amp; Hammer baking Soda toothpaste is a good product that I have been using for a number of years.  As of late, however, it is increasingly difficult to find this product in familiar stores.  There are now seven or eight products on the shelves, all with nearly identical packaging, even the same name with only an added adjective.  This has caused me or a family member to buy the wrong product on numerous occasions. There is a lot of variance in the taste of the different products.  Those with added peroxide are particularly rank.  We have thrown many just-opened tubes in the trash.         We think that arm and hammer is making a mistake with this strategy, it seems gimmicky, and is a turn-off to the kind of customer that buys the original baking soda toothpaste.       Regretfully, we will be switching to a new product.</li>
    <li> My teeth not only FEEL cleaner, but my dentist even commented on how clean my teeth are since I&#x27;ve started using this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I have used this particular product for several years and this particular one is hard to get.  It does a good job of cleaning and has a great flavor</li>
    <li> Our local supermarkets have stopped carrying this item!  Amazon thankfully still has it...this toothpaste has the highest amount of baking soda of all other brands, and it makes a difference.  I often wonder why great products like this one are taken down for trendy new, but inferior ones.  Cosmetic teeth whitening by peroxide apparently trumps good, safe cleaning. Please don&#x27;t give up on this great product</li>
    <li> The new improved version caused serious swelling and burning of the lips.  I also looked like a clown and had to get some steriod cream from the doctor to heal my lips.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste makes my teeth and mouth feel fresh for a long time.</li>
    <li> When the original product was pulled from market, I was sooo disappointed... then A&amp;H put out the \\&quot;new &amp; improved\\&quot; toothpaste line, but it has a new formula. I was concerned because they added chemicals I wasn&#x27;t familiar with, but thought it should be ok since I had enjoyed the original so much as it was the ONLY toothpaste that left my mouth feeling fresh &amp; clean. Slowly over the last few weeks, I&#x27;ve developed a strong gag reflex every time I use the darn stuff and this morning my tongue swelled &amp; the gagging caused me to vomit &amp; gag for over 20 min. I really miss the old product... sad they let a good thing go. Need to find a new product without all the nasty added chemicals. My advice to Arm &amp; Hammer... (duh) loose the poisonous chemicals, K.I.S.S.</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothpaste for about 2-3 years since WalMart stopped selling Pearldrops toothpaste and back in 2009 I developed a HORRIBLE HORRIBLE rash/inflammation around the corners of my mouth....I mean peeling, crusting, red, swollen, the whole 9 yards.  It was very embarrassing and depressing, not knowing the source of the problem.  I noticed that this would last months and go away.  Here recently I have not had an issue until I bought a brand new tube of this stuff and here I am again....Clownlike rash all around my mouth and it is hard to open, smile and all that due to the painful rash that has developed.  Something told me to google this issue and there it is......an allergic reaction.  I am switching toothpastes TODAY because I can no longer deal with this. :(</li>
    <li> My favorite 20 years running. Nothing more effective for me for breath odor control.</li>
    <li> Tastes just like the cleaner you experience in a dental office - for good reason, similar chemistry.</li>
    <li> THE NEW/OLD PACKAGE COLORS ARE HARD TO DECIPHER. HOW ABOUT THE OLD PACKAGE.  PEOPLE DO NOT WANT DIFFERENT COLORS EVERY TIME THEY SHOP.  ARM AND HAMMER NEEDS TO SLOW IT DOWN - OR GO TO HELL.  I&#x27;M TIRED OF GUESSING WHAT&#x27;S INSIDE THE TOOTHPASTE BECAUSE OF COLORFUL UPDATES.</li>
    <li> BEST. TOOTHPASTE. EVER!</li>
    <li> Love the &amp;#34;Advance Cleaning&amp;#34; kind of Arm &amp; Hammer.  It really has an abrasive quality that really cleans teeth better than anything else we have tried.</li>
    <li> This excellent product is recommended by my dentist and hard to find in local stores.</li>
    <li> I have used this toothpaste for many (10+ years), and it is so good for your teeth and is gentle besides.  Cleans with the best of them, and does not rip up your mouth like those with all those crappy additives.  I LOVE this toothpaste, but for some mysterious reason, it is hard to find.  Osco just discontinued carrying it, to my great dissatisfaction.  All those whiteners and additives really give me lots of mouth irritation.  NOT WITH THIS TOOTHPASTE......And my 32 teeth on this 73 year old are like new.</li>
    <li> I have a history of food intolerance gluten (celiac&#x27;s disease), casein intolerance, and a soy allergy.  Plus allergic skin reaction to cheap laundry detergents (looks like i had measles), and cetaphil cream.     After using this product, my entire tongue is swollen, raw, the sides of my tougue look like someone took a razor to them.  I can&#x27;t taste anything, and can barely eat or drink anything the pain is so intense.     Never thought anything like this would happen from a toothpaste, it&#x27;s never happened to me before.     Stay away from this product.  Especially if you have a history of food/contact allergies.</li>
    <li> Simply the best they should stop making all of the other arm&amp;hammer toothpaste and market this one exclusively the consumers get confused by the many different types however this is the only one to buy!!!</li>
    <li> tastes great and leaves a refreshing taste in the mouth.  also the baking soda part whitens the teeth and leaves them shiny</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;m the only one in my family to be affected by this toothpaste, but my lips and corners of my mouth are literally burned after one use of this product. At first I didn&#x27;t know what was causing such severe chappness, and after a few weeks I stopped using the toothpaste. Years later, I was out of my Sunrider toothpaste (which is the only toothpaste out there that actually rebuilds your tooth enamel and cleans w/ live enzymes!) so I went to use my son&#x27;s Arm &amp; Hammer and once again I look like a clown with swollen burnt lips.</li>
    <li> Could not find the original regular strength.  Was told they stopped making.  Found this on Amazon and I like this brand.  Stores still don&#x27;t sell this brand and I don&#x27;t no why.</li>
    <li> Package arrived within 2 days, in excellent condition.  Started using product right away.  Great quality and excellent cleaning.  I was worried about taste but not a problem at all.</li>
    <li> I hate to say it, but I was glad to see another reviewer of this product state that her husband had the same allergic reaction to this toothpaste as I had --I thought it was just me! His symptoms sounded a bit worse than mine, actually; but the reviewer did say that he had a number of allergies, whereas I&#x27;m only allergic to poison ivy and those types of plants. However, using this product for only a couple of days has made my tongue and the inside and corners of my mouth red, swollen, dry and raw, and my lips so swollen from the inside that I look as though I&#x27;ve had really bad collagen implants done. I&#x27;ve stopped using the toothpaste, of course, but even after a couple of days I&#x27;m still taking Benadryl 3 or 4 times a day to minimize the symptoms and I feel as though my taste buds have been seared off. Beware of this product!</li>
    <li> excellent, only toothpaste i use</li>
    <li> I have fibromyalgia, and many products contain chemicals that cause flare ups of symptoms. Arm &amp; Hammer original is the only toothpaste on the market that I have found that does not cause problems. And I have not gotten any cavities since using it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Using this for many years.</li>
    <li> I have used this toothpaste for 20 years and I love it! It has quite a &amp;#34;zing&amp;#34; to it so it might take a few times to get used to but once you do - you will never go back to your old toothpaste. This really leaves clean teeth and a fresh mouth!</li>
    <li> I am a dental hygienist and I recommend this product to all my patients. I does excellent cleaning teeth and keeping the bacteria growth lower in your mouth. Plus the baking soda helps keep your teeth white!</li>
    <li> I have loved and used this toothpaste exclusively ever since it came out. I like the cleaning power of the Dental Care version specifically. I don&#x27;t feel like the baking soda power is present in most of the other variations. Target carries about six versions of Arm and Hammer but very few stores carry the Dental Care. A real treat to be able to fill up the linen closet with a substantial supply. Price is competitive with what I was paying at local grocer.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste has caused terrible dryness and cracking of the lips and dryness and burning of the inner mouth. I first suspected it was the toothpaste then when I read the reviews here, I was certain.&lt;br /&gt;its been 24 hours since I have stopped using it last but the terrible burning and dryness is still there, also swelling and soreness of the tongue.</li>
    <li> The search for a silica-free toothpaste ends here.  A very gentle and effective dentifrice.</li>
    <li> I was rushed to the emergency room after my second day of using the peroxide and baking soda toothpaste.  My mouth, tongue and lips were on fire.  I had to have to epi shots and am on steriods now.  I&#x27;ve never been allergic to anything before but this almost killed me.</li>
    <li> This is recommended by our dentist because it has the highest baking soda content of any other toothpaste on the market.  It leaves my teeth feeling clean and breath fresh.  Other toothpastes seem to leave a film on my teeth and rest of my mouth.  This one leaves everything feeling smooth and clean.</li>
    <li> Growing up my father was a dentist and we received literally hundreds of different samples of toothpaste all the time, now as an adult I consider myself something of a toothpaste aficionado (am I seriously making this claim?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite toothpaste by far. Arm and Hammer&#x27;s other baking soda toothpastes are good too, but contain peroxide, so you run the risk of bleaching your clothes, bath towels or whatever they get on. Yes, the same peroxide that bleaches your teeth white also bleaches clothing, something they don&#x27;t like to advertise, but will admit if you contact their consumer representatives as I did a couple years back. But this one has no peroxide, so you&#x27;re in the clear!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are the other reasons I think this toothpaste is excellent? The high baking soda concentration: after brushing rub your tongue against your teeth, they will feel noticeably smoother. Think your teeth were getting cleaner with any other toothpaste? Try it. Regarding breath freshness: Previously I had been a fan of Colgate Total, which similarly offers fresh breath for an extended period. I&#x27;ve moved away from Colgate Total because it uses Triclosan as an antibacterial to kill literally all the bacteria in your mouth (or 99.9% of common household bacteria, per my Dial hand soap dispenser*). Am I a medical researcher or someone who is qualified to raise a concern over this? No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*:Does use of antibacterial hand soap but not toothpaste make me a hypocrite? Fair question. We now know intestinal/gut bacteria is good for proper digestion, hence the rise of probiotics. Since the mouth is somewhere between the stomach and the hand, I&#x27;m willing to wager that the micro flora in your mouth is more important than the micro flora on your hands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Arm &amp; Hammer&#x27;s baking soda toothpaste since my dentist recommended it over 12 years ago because it doesn&#x27;t contain silica (sand) which wears down enamel. Since then, the formula&#x27;s changed slightly and the box has changed a lot, but this is still the same excellent toothpaste it&#x27;s always been. I&#x27;ve had no problem sticking with it all this time because it leaves my teeth slick and clean and my mouth feeling fresh.     It&#x27;s too bad that so many people prefer trying to make their teeth whiter by brushing with a more abrasive toothpaste that this product isn&#x27;t carried in my local stores anymore and I have to buy it online. THANK YOU, Amazon, for carrying it!    I don&#x27;t know to which product those reviewers who complained about different ingredients causing allergic reactions are referring. My order just arrived (5/13/10) and the ingredients are: sodium fluoride, sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), water, glycerin, sodium saccharin, PEG-8, flavor, cellulose gum, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate. The UPC is 033200183709.    Rest assured, this is the good toothpaste!</li>
    <li> We cannot find this exact toothpaste locally so I am glad Amazon has it for sale.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find it in stores any more. It&#x27;s great to finally find a good option online.</li>
    <li> Only tooth paste I will ever use.</li>
    <li> Easy transaction.  No hassles.  Product as described.</li>
    <li> best tooth paste I&#x27;ve ever used....!</li>
    <li> The only Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste without peroxide.  They have about 50 different kinds - 49 with peroxide.</li>
    <li> I had been using pepsodent toothpaste with baking soda, many years ago, however, once I came across this toothpaste, it is now the only one that I will buy. Mouth seems to stay clean feeling and fresh longer.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t settle for any other toothpaste</li>
    <li> Great product, best tried of many.</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste ever. Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste ever. I&#x27;ve used it for years, but as others have noted on Amazon reviews it&#x27;s nearly impossible to find in stores anywhere. I am beyond thrilled that I found I can buy it on Amazon. I really like the way it tastes and cleans without bells and whistles or unnecessary whiteners.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always dealt with mouth ulcers. Even as a child, my grandmother kept me on a strict regimen of Acidophilus to help keep them at bay. It&#x27;s always been just one at time, along the gumline. A little over a month ago though, I woke up one morning with a mouth full. On the roof, on my uvula (so bad that it was swolen to the point of dragging the back of my tongue). I&#x27;ve fought them for weeks now. They go away, they come back. I could not think of anything different in my diet and after 2 doctor visits and much money spent on remedies, it dawned on me that maybe it was the toothpaste that I started using. This has been a miserable few weeks, and I;m hoping that discontinuing the use of this toothpaste will discontinue the ulcers.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste have been using for years. It is the only toothpaste that makes my mouth feel truly clean.</li>
    <li> I prefer this product over others and it is sometimes hard to find at the store.</li>
    <li> I like the taste a lot  Maybe someday I will find a NO FLUORIDE version</li>
    <li> The original. Very hard to find.</li>
    <li> I was so relieved to find the other reviews here detailing the allergic reactions some people are having to this product. I bought a tube for my travel bag, went on a business trip, and two days later, the inside of my mouth was burned raw and hurt, making talking and eating very difficult. I Googled like crazy and couldn&#x27;t find any reasonable explanation. I came home from the trip, switched back to my normal toothpaste, and the problem cleared up. Then I went on a second trip a few weeks later, used the Arm &amp; Hammer from my travel bag again, and Boom. Much worse this time - my lips also swelled up, turned dry and cracked (along with the painful mouth burn). This time, I was reasonably sure it was the toothpaste. A Google search for \\&quot;Arm &amp; Hammer Toothpaste Burns\\&quot; let me right here.    I&#x27;m not usually an allergy-prone person. This product should be handled with extreme caution, and I do hope Arm &amp; Hammer is paying attention to these reviews.</li>
    <li> I sought out A&amp;H Dental Care Advance Cleaning toothpaste because it is the lowest abrasivity toothpaste (RDA 35) with fluoride that I can find on the market. I have been using it for years including through packaging changes to the current (overly fancy) metallic gold &amp; green box. The last batch I bought was UPC 033200183709 about two years ago. I have had none of the problems described in the negative reviews. The ingredient list on the two year old box I hold in my hand today reads: sodium fluoride, sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), water, glycerin, sodium saccharin, PEG-8, flavor, cellulose gum, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate. I called the C&amp;D customer service line today at 800-524-1328 and the agent checked and confirmed that the current product being marketed with UPC 033200183709 and the name A&amp;H Dental Care Advance Cleaning has the same ingredients as listed above.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been hooked on Arm and Hammer for a few years now. The extra amount of baking soda in the toothpaste really does help to make my teeth feel clean. Not as sweet tasting as other brands, which I also appreciate as well.</li>
    <li> The toothpaste seems to work... The flavor is a little bland, but I don&#x27;t really care about that. Hard to say if it is or isn&#x27;t working, but my teeth do look and feel clean.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste not only helps with whitening, but has reduced my tartar build up between dental visits, and I go every six months. I&#x27;ve noticed improvement around my gumline where I have a crown. I also don&#x27;t have to use very much paste on the brush. A little of this really goes a long way! Love the fresh mint taste, too. The price is a bargain. Buying six at a time gets me through most of the year and saves me $1.50 plus per tube. Love the free shipping, as well.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste but have been unable to find it locally so was very happy to find it available through Amazon.  It works wonderful!  It seems I am very sensitive to the whitening ingredients in most of the toothpastes available these days and the stores in my area seem to be unwilling to carry a toothpaste that is not also a whitening product.  Thank you, Amazon, for carrying a product for those of us who want clean teeth without the whitening chemicals!</li>
    <li> I like this particular type of Arm and Hammer but cannot find it in the store.</li>
    <li> Great product and good buy</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only fluoridated toothpaste whose flavor I actually like, and that doesn&#x27;t totally distort taste sensation for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what bothered some other reviewers - perhaps they were sent the wrong product or something? Tis is just what it&#x27;s supposed to be, and a whole lot cheaper than at drugstores.</li>
    <li> We order this package like four times a year. The toothpaste is great, not terribly abrasive, and contains baking soda, but no peroxide. It&#x27;s our favorite, and the six pack, or whatever it is, is priced at less than buying a tube at a time. Ships quickly</li>
    <li> Decent price and received it quick.</li>
    <li> My dentist advised me not to use a toothpaste with &amp;#34;tartar control&amp;#34;.  This toothpaste is hard to find locally.  It does a great job of cleaning my teeth.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is the only one I have come across without silica, a common ingredient used as an abrasive.  I have bonding on my teeth, and silica is not good for bonding.  The taste is minty but not overwhemingly so.  I have used this A&amp;H Dental Care toothpaste for years and years, but recently could no longer find it in stores.  I was very happy to find it here at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to use any other toothpaste ever again, this is the best, tastes really good works really good</li>
    <li> LOVE THE TEXTURE AND TASTE!!! OUT OF ALL THE VARIATIONS THIS IS THE BEST!!!! IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE TEETH THIS WILL NOT BOTHER YOU. SMELLS GOOD TOO!</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this toothpaste at a hotel in Houston and it is awesome. Great cor deep cleaning and breath. This is the best toothbpastre I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Please see the previous rating I&#x27;ve given this product. I would certainly recommend it to my friends and family. Thank you</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully for me with or without my electric toothpaste.  My teeth feel wonderfully clean... minty fresh!  Previously, I a little under twenty dollars, I hope I can find it at the same price again.  Be careful of the amount you use on your toothbrushes, if you happen to be sensitive to the baking soda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it, it&#x27;s my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Remains the lowest rating in abrasiveness available,  at least since Arm &amp; Hammer stopped selling their tooth powder.</li>
    <li> I began to notice some time back that I could not find this particular formula on the shelves with all the other Arm &amp; Hammer Dental Care products. When I did find it, I noticed the price had increased dramatically over what I used to pay. A search on Amazon paid off and I was happy to find it available in a pack of 6. This formula has the ADA symbol on the box, which I always look for. The other newer formulas do not.</li>
    <li> This is the only toothpaste I&#x27;ve found that does not have silica (sand or grit) in it. Silica is great if you have young children who don&#x27;t brush very well. But Silica wears out teeth before their time because it cleans and whitens by grinding away the surface enamel. Adults who know how to properly brush their teeth are better off with less or no silica. That&#x27;s why I really like this toothpaste. The only tangible benefit of toothpaste is fluoride applied with a toothbrush. Every other benefit (whitening or fresh breath) can be achieved in other ways. the toothbrush and floss are the truly indispensable tools for cleaning teeth.  The baking soda is a great way to go for these other benefits with less harm to the tooth itself.</li>
    <li> My mom used to buy us this toothpaste as kids and I remembered loving it, so I ordered it. My husband is in love with Crest with Scope, and was a skeptic, but I&#x27;ve converted him. There&#x27;s not another toothpaste that takes away bad odor or bad tastes in your mouth, I promise</li>
    <li> Its toothpaste, he likes it, its a good price and ships directly to the house with subscribe and save. Not much more to say about it.</li>
    <li> This product is very refreshing I use it in morning and bed time and price is also fare and my wife and children love it tooooo....</li>
    <li> I love the clean feel of my teeth after using this toothpaste. Flavor is good when you get used to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Crest, and all the other leading brands but Arm &amp; Hammer leave my teeth feeling smooth after brushing each and every time.  I happen to like this one from Arm &amp; Hammer the best.  They make other flavors and degrees of teeth whitening etc.  But this one has worked out the best for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad to find Arm &amp; Hammer dental care on your site. It&#x27;s been difficult to find lately! Thank you</li>
    <li> Excellent service and price</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste and it&#x27;s getting harder to find.  It really does leave you feeling like you just left the dentist.</li>
    <li> Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste really leaves my mouth with a clean sensation. The six pack and the bigger size assures that I won&#x27;t run out of the toothpaste. The subscription plan also is a great way to keep a good stock on hand.</li>
    <li> Twice I ordered Dental Care Advance Cleaning with the green label which is the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; flavor but always get the purple label.I even returned the last order for an exchange; however, the purple one was sent again.not what I wanted but I kept it.</li>
    <li> My favorite. Can&#x27;t find it anywhere else</li>
    <li> My favorite and it was almost impossible to find anywhere else for a couple of months</li>
    <li> No effects on mouth tissues as with other (chemically laden) versions of Arm &amp; Hammer toothpastes. Plain ol&#x27; Dental Care seems hard to find--stores readily stock the other versions--perhaps people go for all the hoopla associated with the various additives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Persistent burning, off-taste mouth sensation went away in a week or so after returning to straight Dental Care.</li>
    <li> Can not find this in the stores in my area. Favorite toothpaste ever. Leaves teeth feeling really clean.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect toothpaste!! I am so glad to be able to order it on Amazon!! FAST shipping...thanks!!</li>
    <li> the taste is not very good but i can feel how well it cleans</li>
    <li> We have used this toothpaste for years but recently it has disappeared from store shelves. If you&#x27;re looking for a baking soda toothpaste without all the extra &amp;#34;fad&amp;#34; ingredients this is the one for you. It leaves your teeth squeaky clean similar to a trip to your hygienist</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste.  Does not irritate my mouth, like all the other toothpastes I have tried.  No grit.</li>
    <li> My dentist advised me that this toothpaste is the best at actually cleaning your teeth. It took me a week or two to get used to baking-powder toothpaste, but I&#x27;ve never looked back. This toothpaste leaves my teeth feeling much cleaner than any other toothpaste, and I actually like the taste now. My dental health also improved once I started using it. All of the stores around me have stopped carrying it (in favor of fancy toothpastes with additional features, like whitening), but Amazon comes to the rescue! Recommend.</li>
    <li> My husband and I love this toothpaste. It has a nice flavor and it works well. It&#x27;s not harsh at all.</li>
    <li> I have used Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste products for years, and generally found them to be fantastic. I can not say I have enjoyed this Dental Care as much. For one this feels like you have baking soda and salt in your mouth. I def recognize this is a baking soda product, but it is ridiculous--  after this is all out I am going back to Arm &amp; Hammer Advance White Brilliant Sparkle, I have used for years. Second, I now have a cavities, never had any for years, but within month of using this Dental Care I have cavities... perhaps it has nothing to do with this product, but makes me wonder how good this Dental Care Really is.</li>
    <li> Best all around toothpaste I&#x27;ve found, super job on my teeth, great tasting and not so much grit that they harm the enamel.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive teeth, and I don&#x27;t even feel it when I use this toothpaste.  I can eat really hot and really cold food.</li>
    <li> I have used &amp;#34;Dental Care&amp;#34; w/o peroxide for years and could not find it in the stores and bought, by mistake or ignorance not having used any toothpaste with peroxide, another formulation of A&amp;H tooth paste and suffered the consequences!  I did not know what was happening to my mouth until I did a search on-line and discovered it was the PEROXIDE!  It took about half of the tube before my problems started.  First came the blisters on the gums and then severe cracking at the corners of my mouth and finally bleeding!  I did not know what was going on so after an on-line search I came to the conclusion it was the Peroxide in the toothpaste!  In the meantime, until I could find a tooth paste w/o peroxide I started brushing with just plain baking soda, which is not really all that bad and less abrasive that most toothpastes and the problems started to disappear within days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally found this A&amp;H WITHOUT peroxide on Amazon, which was the formula I had been buying for many years.  So beware of the PEROXIDE in your tooth paste, even other brands.  You can use with confidence this formula!  I might add that it is the Peroxide in tooth whitening products that can also cause problems if you are sensitive to the peroxide so use those products also with caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If A&amp;H ever stopped making this formula of tooth paste I would be forced to go back to brushing with just baking soda because I will NEVER buy another tooth paste with Peroxide in it!  I also wish A&amp;H would leave the fluoride out of the tooth pastes also but that&#x27;s a topic for another day!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere else. Husband likes it much better than other iterations of the Arm and Hammer brand.</li>
    <li> Great taste and leaves my mouth and teeth feeling really clean and fresh.  Have been using it since Arm&amp;Hammer introduced it years ago.  I do not like the peroxide versions.  It is nearly impossible to find this product in the local stores.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful toothpaste..Hard to find in local stores.&lt;br /&gt;I stock up on it as I&#x27;m  afraid it will dissapear. I bought 6 this time.</li>
    <li> Hard to find through local retailers.  This product was exactly what we were looking for!</li>
    <li> It is the best of the family of toothpastes made by Arm &amp; Hammer.  In my opinion, it is also the healthiest for your teeth.  We have used it for years.  Our three grown up kids still use it, including their nine children.&lt;br /&gt;[ASIN:B001E724A2 Arm &amp; Hammer Dental Care Fluoride Toothpaste, Advance Cleaning, Maximum Strength, Fresh Mint 6.3 oz (178 g) (Pack of 6)]]</li>
    <li> Thank heavens for Amazon still carrying this kind of toothpaste because now all the stores seem to have abandoned it and I can&#x27;t figure out why. I simply can&#x27;t use the kind that &amp;#34;whitens&amp;#34; teeth with peroxide&amp;#34; because I get canker sores every time I do, and I love the fresh taste that the baking soda gives me. I hope Amazon continues to supply this.</li>
    <li> My fault ~ I ordered the wrong tooth paste!</li>
