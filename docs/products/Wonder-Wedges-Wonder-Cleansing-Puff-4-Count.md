### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product.</li>
      <li>It still is a great product but maybe not for me</li>
      <li>this was a great product for me until my skin started to become irritated.</li>
      <li>Amazing product from Amazon!  </li>
      <li>Good golly did they hurt.</li>
      <li>and they buff the shine off my face so good</li>
      <li>Good alternative to the Buf-Pufs</li>
      <li>Just as good as the name brand.</li>
      <li>Use with your favorite face wash and you will be impressed with the smooth skin remains after</li>
      <li>and then I have twice as many!).  </li>
      <li>I love these scrubby sponges!</li>
      <li>I think that these puffs are just as good as the famous name brand.</li>
      <li>this is a nice texture scrub sponge to use for my facials</li>
      <li>I Liked them allot.</li>
      <li>These have a nice price, but they are more abrasive then a buff puff</li>
      <li>Love them.</li>
      <li>These were so scratchy they hurt my face even when barely touching it.</li>
      <li>I love these pads.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re okay -- they do the trick.</li>
      <li>This brand is fantastic!</li>
      <li>I knew better</li>
      <li>Buf Puf may cost more, but it lasts a lot longer.</li>
      <li>And they work better than these.</li>
      <li>They are PERFECT for exfoliating the facial area and body.</li>
      <li>It works I use it at night to clean off make up and scrub my face!</li>
      <li>I would also use a moisturizer afterward if your skin dries out easily.</li>
      <li>Otherwise this is fine for scrubbing feet and legs.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend says they work fine</li>
      <li>Very durable and just as effective as the beauty supply store version.</li>
      <li>First bag of these I got were okay for my face.</li>
      <li>This brand is a bit more coarse, and that is fine for me, but, many may not agree.</li>
      <li>but they make my face feel super clean.</li>
      <li>So now i rarely use it.</li>
      <li>Such a great deal, especially for four!  </li>
      <li>Second bag I got, I was pretty sure I was rubbing into cheek</li>
      <li>I got exactly what i wanted.</li>
      <li>I must place emphasis on the word GENTLE!</li>
      <li>but I still love them, I use them to scrub my face and also my armpits (two different ones of course, I cut on so I can till them apart).</li>
      <li>Great alternative to the buff puff and last just as long for me.</li>
      <li>If you have super sensitive skin, look for this item in a GENTLE form.</li>
      <li>but I really wanted to believe these would work and hold up as well as a Buf Puf.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gone through the whole pack already.  </li>
      <li>Just dampen them, add some cleanser, and GENTLY rotate on the skin.</li>
      <li>My skin was okay with this for the first 3 sponges but the fourth totally took a toll on my skin</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re more scratchy than other pads, and that&#x27;s what she wanted.</li>
      <li>When these sponges are new, just press down with very light pressure so that you don&#x27;t rub your skin too abrasively.</li>
      <li>They are a little rougher than most.</li>
      <li>Normally I may just have gone through one or two.  </li>
      <li>The quality doesn&#x27;t feel as nice as the other brand I bought at my local drug store and feels a little harsher on the skin when brand new, but they last a long time and come at a great price</li>
      <li>These are about the size of my palm, which is nice for use on legs and body but bigger than what I prefer for my face:  I cut a couple of these in half (easier to manage</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still like new.</li>
      <li>, she couldn&#x27;t find them in the store near us so for the price amazon was a decent alternative.</li>
      <li>so it dries quickly (letting it sit flat retains the water which enables bacteria growth), and one pad can last a couple weeks before it&#x27;s worn</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Granted, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I also saw the EXACT same item (same brand, quantity, etc.)</li>
      <li>These facial sponges don&#x27;t have the normal density that others have.  </li>
      <li>These don&#x27;t last and squish down quickly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been purchasing a similar version like this from the beauty supply store that works well, but after a few uses, it begins to get soft losing the mild abrasion for scrubbing, and it also begin to come apart.</li>
      <li>They seem exactly the same as those others except died pink instead of bleached white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Exfoliating doesn&#x27;t need to be done daily unless your skin is prone to break out or very oily, so just use them less often with a lighter touch for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Too rough for older skin</li>
      <li>This was pretty harsh.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t find them too rough as some reviewers mentioned, but perhaps those with very sensitive skin might want to choose a scrubbing sponge with a finer weave on the fibers.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not as dense as the 3M brand and not likely to last long if used frequently.</li>
      <li>nothing fancy here just basic exfoliating pads which is exactly what I was wanting...use a few times and toss...don&#x27;t expect them to last</li>
      <li>Of similar size an color to delicate Buff Puffs, these are distinctly less dense and more coarse.</li>

<li> They do not last as long as a buff puff.</li>
<li> People with very sensitive skin typically don&#x27;t exfoliate, or do it much less frequently if their skin can&#x27;t handle it.</li>
<li> To make them last longer, I rinse and shake out excess water, then prop up to dry.</li>
<li> I have small hands, so I cut these in half and they&#x27;re the right size then.  </li>
<li> When one touches these little puffs, they seem soft and squishy, but when you wipe them across your face they feel like sandpaper.  </li>
<li> So, no, they are absolutely not too rough.</li>
<li> I have to use a lot of soap with them because they are so rough</li>
<li> it was just too rough.</li>
<li> well this is what I expected...</li>
<li> They are alil to rough</li>
<li> people said they were too rough.</li>
<li> I purchase cleansing puffs a lot for my face and expect them to exfoliate but these are extremely rough in comparison to any I have ever had.</li>
<li> They still work even after they&#x27;ve gone flat, which they do within just a few uses.  </li>
<li> at the 99 cent store the other day.</li>
<li> I used to buy the small round white cleansing puffs</li>
<li> The process of exfoliation is sloughing off your dead skin, so of course it&#x27;s rough.</li>
<li> These break down a lot quicker</li>
<li> They do a job, but will not last so long and are not suitable for delicate skin.</li>
<li> Perhaps they are a little rougher --- but I would rather have a rougher puff I can afford than no puff at all.</li>
<li> After you break one in after a few uses, then you press a touch</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know what other &amp;#34;more expensive brand&amp;#34; people were talking about  in their reviews, but I had been buying the cheap-o Swisspers brand from W-Mart previously and bought these when W-Mart didn&#x27;t have the other.</li>
<li> I have used in the past.</li>
<li> If you have delicate skin I would recommend finding a scrub pad that specifies &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34;.</li>
<li> These are a tough scrub.</li>
<li> Sorry.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Of similar size an color to delicate Buff Puffs, these are distinctly less dense and more coarse. They do a job, but will not last so long and are not suitable for delicate skin.</li>
    <li> I think that these puffs are just as good as the famous name brand. Perhaps they are a little rougher --- but I would rather have a rougher puff I can afford than no puff at all.</li>
    <li> My skin was okay with this for the first 3 sponges but the fourth totally took a toll on my skin I had tiny scabs everywhere it was just too rough. So now i rarely use it. Luckily I am on my last one.</li>
    <li> These are a tough scrub.</li>
    <li> Love them. Rougher than what I am used to but they make my face feel super clean.</li>
    <li> Good alternative to the Buf-Pufs I have used in the past. These are about the size of my palm, which is nice for use on legs and body but bigger than what I prefer for my face:  I cut a couple of these in half (easier to manage and then I have twice as many!).  I don&#x27;t find them too rough as some reviewers mentioned, but perhaps those with very sensitive skin might want to choose a scrubbing sponge with a finer weave on the fibers.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re okay -- they do the trick.</li>
    <li> These work well, although they do go flat quicker than buff-puffs.  I have small hands, so I cut these in half and they&#x27;re the right size then.  They still work even after they&#x27;ve gone flat, which they do within just a few uses.  Lasts about a month of daily use for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing a similar version like this from the beauty supply store that works well, but after a few uses, it begins to get soft losing the mild abrasion for scrubbing, and it also begin to come apart. This brand is fantastic! I&#x27;ve been using the same sponge longer than I would have with the beauty store version and it still scrubs well and hasn&#x27;t come apart yet.</li>
    <li> I will never buy these again and will fork over the extra dough for Buf Pufs. These don&#x27;t last and squish down quickly. Buf Puf may cost more, but it lasts a lot longer. And they work better than these.</li>
    <li> Photo shows bag of 12 and that&#x27;s what I thought I&#x27;d ordered. Text shows what I actually received, 4.</li>
    <li> this was a great product for me until my skin started to become irritated. It still is a great product but maybe not for me I have sensitive skin. I would maybe recommend but I don&#x27;t think I would be purchasing this again</li>
    <li> I knew better but I really wanted to believe these would work and hold up as well as a Buf Puf.  They don&#x27;t.  Only a couple of uses and they&#x27;re mashed and flattened.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I love these scrubby sponges! They are PERFECT for exfoliating the facial area and body. Just dampen them, add some cleanser, and GENTLY rotate on the skin. I must place emphasis on the word GENTLE! This brand is a bit more coarse, and that is fine for me, but, many may not agree. If you have super sensitive skin, look for this item in a GENTLE form. That way it won&#x27;t be as abrasive on the skin, especially the facial area.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what other &amp;#34;more expensive brand&amp;#34; people were talking about  in their reviews, but I had been buying the cheap-o Swisspers brand from W-Mart previously and bought these when W-Mart didn&#x27;t have the other. They seem exactly the same as those others except died pink instead of bleached white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people said they were too rough. They aren&#x27;t. Those people don&#x27;t understand the concept of exfoliation. The process of exfoliation is sloughing off your dead skin, so of course it&#x27;s rough. People with very sensitive skin typically don&#x27;t exfoliate, or do it much less frequently if their skin can&#x27;t handle it. When these sponges are new, just press down with very light pressure so that you don&#x27;t rub your skin too abrasively. After you break one in after a few uses, then you press a touch harder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just squeeze it out when done and prop it up so it dries quickly (letting it sit flat retains the water which enables bacteria growth), and one pad can last a couple weeks before it&#x27;s worn out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use these daily, my skin is noticeably clearer. I use it twice a day every day. So, no, they are absolutely not too rough. Granted, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. But, if I did, then I wouldn&#x27;t be using it twice a day every day! Exfoliating doesn&#x27;t need to be done daily unless your skin is prone to break out or very oily, so just use them less often with a lighter touch for sensitive skin. I would also use a moisturizer afterward if your skin dries out easily.</li>
    <li> It works I use it at night to clean off make up and scrub my face!</li>
    <li> I purchase cleansing puffs a lot for my face and expect them to exfoliate but these are extremely rough in comparison to any I have ever had. I feel like I am scraping my skin off. I definitely wont be purchasing these again.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to a friend. They were just as described. I Liked them allot. I will buy them again</li>
    <li> I got exactly what i wanted. I have a steamer at home and do facials on myself and family here and there. this is a nice texture scrub sponge to use for my facials</li>
    <li> I love these pads. Just abrasive enough for my face and neck. To make them last longer, I rinse and shake out excess water, then prop up to dry. Squeezing seems to make them breakdown sooner.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; scrub for my face as I&#x27;ve been using these types of scrub pads for years; the 3M brand specifically. This was pretty harsh. If you have delicate skin I would recommend finding a scrub pad that specifies &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34;. Otherwise this is fine for scrubbing feet and legs. I agree with another reviewer in that it&#x27;s not as dense as the 3M brand and not likely to last long if used frequently.</li>
    <li> They are alil to rough but I still love them, I use them to scrub my face and also my armpits (two different ones of course, I cut on so I can till them apart). This helps get the deodorant out that my loofa doesn&#x27;t get. I have to use a lot of soap with them because they are so rough but they lose a bit of the roughness after a while of useing them.</li>
    <li> I like these puff type facial sponges because of their wear and tear ability.  I&#x27;ve gone through the whole pack already.  Normally I may just have gone through one or two.  Sorry.  I&#x27;ll go back to the more expensive ones next time.</li>
    <li> These have a nice price, but they are more abrasive then a buff puff so you may not want to use them on your face. They do not last as long as a buff puff.</li>
    <li> These facial sponges don&#x27;t have the normal density that others have.  They are a little rougher than most. However, I will use them.</li>
    <li> Just as good as the name brand.</li>
    <li> Too rough for older skin</li>
    <li> The quality doesn&#x27;t feel as nice as the other brand I bought at my local drug store and feels a little harsher on the skin when brand new, but they last a long time and come at a great price so I will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> When one touches these little puffs, they seem soft and squishy, but when you wipe them across your face they feel like sandpaper.  It buffs and polishes!  There are 4 in the package. I&#x27;ve been using 1 for a month and it&#x27;s still like new.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend says they work fine, she couldn&#x27;t find them in the store near us so for the price amazon was a decent alternative. They&#x27;re more scratchy than other pads, and that&#x27;s what she wanted.</li>
    <li> well this is what I expected...simple...cheap...scrubby sponges...nothing fancy here just basic exfoliating pads which is exactly what I was wanting...use a few times and toss...don&#x27;t expect them to last but I guess I didn&#x27;t anyway</li>
    <li> I used to buy the small round white cleansing puffs and I could use one of them for months.  These break down a lot quicker so have to use them quicker.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Very durable and just as effective as the beauty supply store version.</li>
    <li> Amazing product from Amazon!  Such a great deal, especially for four!  I use one a week and they buff the shine off my face so good, I don&#x27;t know how I washed without them!</li>
    <li> These were so scratchy they hurt my face even when barely touching it. I also saw the EXACT same item (same brand, quantity, etc.) at the 99 cent store the other day. Skip this one.</li>
    <li> First bag of these I got were okay for my face. Second bag I got, I was pretty sure I was rubbing into cheek muscle.&lt;br /&gt;THEY HURT!!! Good golly did they hurt. They have now been chosen as leg exfoliaters only.</li>
    <li> Great alternative to the buff puff and last just as long for me. Use with your favorite face wash and you will be impressed with the smooth skin remains after</li>
