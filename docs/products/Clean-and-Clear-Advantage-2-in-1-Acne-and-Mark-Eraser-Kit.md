### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>until i switched to the advantage 2in 1 acne mark kit its awesome</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d have to say it&#x27;s one of the best face washes.</li>
      <li>is really awesome.</li>
      <li>All in all, great product, great system, and great value for the money!</li>
      <li>I really love it!!</li>
      <li>And a HUGE bonus (to me anyway LOL) is the scent!</li>
      <li>It was a good value for the price.</li>
      <li>All in all a good product just don&#x27;t use the spot treatment with another lotion.</li>
      <li>care and good luck</li>
      <li>I loved the leave on face creme and if you douse the wash don&#x27;t use it twice a day.</li>
      <li>just love it !</li>
      <li>(the wife of Chris ) Love this amazing product!</li>
      <li>this stuff works amazing everytime.</li>
      <li>So I began using this product about 2 weeks ago, and have not noticed much of a change in my acne, however my post marks have diminished greatly and almost disappeared!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own</li>
      <li>Figured I&#x27;d try them out then if I was happy with the results I&#x27;d get full size products.</li>
      <li>ever so wonderful time of month CLEAR!</li>
      <li>The face wash was great because it made my face feel fresh every time I used it.</li>
      <li>love it</li>
      <li>Used it once more that night</li>
      <li>To top it off this was said to start showing progress after one day, and it did not</li>
      <li>, it made me break out even more.</li>
      <li>And even though it has a 15 SPF (which I love)it doesn&#x27;t give off that sunscreen smell to it like most moisturizers do</li>
      <li>I love this product have used it for awhile now</li>
      <li>I had tried numerous acne systems, but out of all of them I&#x27;d have to say that this one worked the best for me.</li>
      <li>Very good product other wise...</li>
      <li>but every face is different but i will buy more!!!</li>
      <li>I will continue to use and maybe it will get better, but it was pretty cheap and shipped fast, and makes my skin feel very nice!</li>
      <li>I love the tingle from the cleanser, makes my skin feel very fresh after washing.</li>
      <li>Luckily the moisturizer is great because it&#x27;s not heavy and it moisturizes without sitting on top of your skin.</li>
      <li>Amazingly they were pretty much full size which was just that much better.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ve avoided any and all moisturizers because no matter how light they claim to be I feel slimy afterwards.</li>
      <li>Overall I would say that my acne has not reduced 100%, but for this price, and for it to be an over the counter product, it works great.</li>
      <li>i cant say enough good things about this product i love it</li>
      <li>Anyway, I was super excited to try this.</li>
      <li>So I would say it&#x27;s good overall in clearing up acne and acne marks besides the irritation.</li>
      <li>I especially love the spot treatment I had a really big red zit and put the spot treatment on twice a day for 2 days</li>
      <li>So many systems out there smell rather medicinal, such as Proactiv, and this one is very light and fresh smelling.</li>
      <li>The product just ended up creating more pimples and a big inflammation on my right eye, Product was alright, there are better products than this.</li>
      <li>I was never prone to acne at all as a teen, and I just started breaking out a bit at 30 and it is leaving marks that don&#x27;t seem to go away at all (I&#x27;m VERY fair, and the marks are sort of reddish brown, like a bigger freckle)</li>
      <li>Mine was never really awful, yet I never had a clear complexion.</li>
      <li>and instead it smells nice and leaves a thin yet effective layer of moisture on your skin and stays there through the day.</li>
      <li>Finally the fast acting zit treatment is also great because in the morning I wake and up wash my face, and then apply it to some of my zits.</li>
      <li>I have a pretty oily T zone</li>
      <li>The only drawback is that the spot treatment will bleach fabrics so I am sure to put it on well before changing my clothes or going to bed as to avoid ruining the pillowcases.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Better off buying Clean and Clear at your local drugstore.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast, was exactly the product described and didn&#x27;t have any problems with this order....</li>
      <li>and it took a week of using the Clean &amp; Clear 2 in 1 Acne Mark Eraser Kit for them to go away when it normally would have taken 3 weeks of popping them, applying layer after layer of benzoyl peroxide and hot compresses before they would have scarred and gone away.</li>
      <li>It is for people with oily acne prone skin and it will dry out your face and make you break out more if you don&#x27;t have OILY acne prone skin.  </li>
      <li>but it really did.</li>
      <li>For what I paid, I expected basically trial sizes and that was OK with me.</li>
      <li>It really does burn and irritate my skin a lot.</li>
      <li>Sometimes it will sting though when you put it on, but that lasts about 20 seconds, and really it doesn&#x27;t even hurt that much.</li>
      <li>but this whole kit does nothing for acne and acne marks.</li>
      <li>I do not have sensitive skin and have never had a reaction to anything before, and I&#x27;ve used Clean and Clear cleanser before, but I&#x27;ve never had this type of reaction.  </li>
      <li>First off, let me say that I was really surprised at the size of the items in the kit!</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m fourteen and in high school)</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess the only positive that it has is a pretty box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend though that if you have VERY sensitive skin to NOT order this product.</li>
      <li>This product does not dry my skin out like most other products do.</li>
      <li>When I first bought this product it came with the four things shown above.</li>
      <li>The first week, everything was fine , but no noticeable change (at least my skin was soft).</li>
      <li>and there when my face is so clear...   </li>
      <li>this stuff cleared my face up almost completely in 4 days.</li>
      <li>The cleanser makes your skin feel really soft, though..</li>
      <li>Try it just one every 3 or 4 days if you have sensitive skin like mine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been hoping it would go away (trying so much acne wash has taught me you have to give it several weeks before judging)</li>
      <li>I do recommend this product with those suffering from acne, and they don&#x27;t have seriously sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Even my eyelids were swollen even though this was not put directly on my eyelids.    </li>
      <li>I have been dealing with acne, ACTUAL acne not just a zit or some pimples since I was 12 and have tried EVERYTHING from Proactiv, Murad, every single product from Clearasil, Cetaphil, Neutrogena, Clean &amp; Clear</li>
      <li>With still no results and my african american skin on fire, I just bought some Clean and Clear OTC products, and the burning instantly stopped.</li>
      <li>my skin feels so tight and when I smile my entire face gets really crinkly!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel like it is really cleaning deep into your skin, but it actually is.</li>
      <li>I already have seen major changes in my skin.</li>
      <li>Its only been a few days, and not only is my skin just about clear for the first time in a year, but the marks are fading too!</li>
      <li>Used one night and the next morning and all day my face was very itchy because it was so dry!</li>
      <li>My skin is not sensitive at all, but since I have started using this product my skin has become sensitive.</li>
      <li>I bought this kit since I need to clear up my adult acne and marks left on from other products.</li>
      <li>I was afraid that because it seemed to be rather thick and creamy that it wouldn&#x27;t clean effectively</li>

<li> Its only been a few days, and not only is my skin just about clear for the first time in a year, but the marks are fading too!</li>

<li> My skin is not sensitive at all, but since I have started using this product my skin has become sensitive.</li>
<li> I bought this kit since I need to clear up my adult acne and marks left on from other products.</li>
<li> I was afraid that because it seemed to be rather thick and creamy that it wouldn&#x27;t clean effectively</li>
<li> For a long time I have had trouble with acne kind of like any other usual teenager.</li>
<li> And while the proactiv worked occasionally (not much when I first started using it 10 years ago, but I tried it again last year and it helped a little)</li>
<li> only used this product for two weeks and do not really know if it actually fulfills what it promises</li>
<li> It has only been a few days since I started using this and all of the zits are starting to fade.</li>
<li> The only down side is that it dries out your face because the ingredients strip the oil from your skin.</li>
<li> i don&#x27;t get the big or small deep pimples even the little ones and even during that</li>
<li> and my acne is no more literally with a daily regimen that i am not allowed to fall off of</li>
<li> But other than that I have no complaints.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t experience pain or dryness like the other reviewer, but it isn&#x27;t working for me.</li>
<li> (yes I was skeptical about trying this because all of their other \\&quot;acne\\&quot; products have never worked), St. Ives, Nature&#x27;s cure, Zapzyt to prescription lotions and scrubs from my actual dermatologist, I even bought a Clarisonic thinking if I used something that would scrub my face then the medicated face washes would actually work!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard though because when I wear it to bed, because I have long hair I have to put it a headband to keep the cream away from my hair at night.</li>
<li> It is a somewhat thick white cream that, when it&#x27;s night and your going to bed, you just cover a zit, or maybe a past mark, and in the morning it fades the appearance of the acne noticeably.</li>
<li> i tend to get lazy</li>
<li> Unfortunately,  week two, my skin was actually burning, and kept on burning weeks after since I continued to use it.  </li>
<li> If you try to use another moisturizer over the spot treatment without letting it dry, weird flakes get all on your skin.</li>
<li> I still have acne though, and have since switched to Murad Acne complex.</li>
<li> I feel old and disgusting and I am only 23!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I had deep painful zits on my chin and cheeks</li>
<li> For a couple of weeks it actually wasn&#x27;t so bad, but now I&#x27;m breaking out worse than before.</li>
<li> The kit recommends to use it twice a day, but since it is irritating</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really love it!! It worked for my face, cleared up in about a week no over drying or nothing.....&lt;br /&gt;But the spot remover stuff thaaaaat didt work so well on my face but every face is different but i will buy more!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t experience pain or dryness like the other reviewer, but it isn&#x27;t working for me. I was using Skin ID for a while, but it&#x27;s expensive and, although it helped, it wasn&#x27;t clearing my spots and felt like it was clogging my pores. Anyway, I was super excited to try this. For a couple of weeks it actually wasn&#x27;t so bad, but now I&#x27;m breaking out worse than before. I&#x27;ve been hoping it would go away (trying so much acne wash has taught me you have to give it several weeks before judging) but it&#x27;s not. And my spots didn&#x27;t fade in the slightest.    I also had the white clumps of crap. It was so annoying.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast, was exactly the product described and didn&#x27;t have any problems with this order.... I love this product have used it for awhile now and it definitely works and for this price I could get 2 for what it would cost to get one at a regular store... love it</li>
    <li> I just recieved this product in the mail about 4 days ago and I have been using it every day and night since. I already have seen major changes in my skin. I had realy bad problem areas on my chin and around my forehead. It has only been a few days since I started using this and all of the zits are starting to fade. I especially love the spot treatment I had a really big red zit and put the spot treatment on twice a day for 2 days and the zit was basically gone already. This product does not dry my skin out like most other products do. I will definitely be repurchasing again!</li>
    <li> I received it on May 28. And the exp date was May 2012. You know these are chemical products, is incorrect to use product like these ones already experied, and worst is to sell and cheat people like you did with me.</li>
    <li> (the wife of Chris ) Love this amazing product! I have cystic acne and i had used every product out there i have scars from proactive and nothing i was using was making them lighter or help with my acne. until i switched to the advantage 2in 1 acne mark kit its awesome i saw results with in days! and my acne is no more literally with a daily regimen that i am not allowed to fall off of i don&#x27;t get the big or small deep pimples even the little ones and even during that ever so wonderful time of month CLEAR! i cant say enough good things about this product i love it just love it !</li>
    <li> this stuff works amazing everytime. i don&#x27;t even know why i don&#x27;t just always use it. i tend to get lazy i guess and forget to here and there when my face is so clear...   this stuff cleared my face up almost completely in 4 days.</li>
    <li> My teen used this product and it helped with the acne. It was a good value for the price. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Used one night and the next morning and all day my face was very itchy because it was so dry! Used it once more that night and I woke up the next morning with a swollen face!  I do not have sensitive skin and have never had a reaction to anything before, and I&#x27;ve used Clean and Clear cleanser before, but I&#x27;ve never had this type of reaction.  Even my eyelids were swollen even though this was not put directly on my eyelids.    To top it off this was said to start showing progress after one day, and it did not, it made me break out even more.</li>
    <li> First off, let me say that I was really surprised at the size of the items in the kit! For what I paid, I expected basically trial sizes and that was OK with me. Figured I&#x27;d try them out then if I was happy with the results I&#x27;d get full size products. Amazingly they were pretty much full size which was just that much better. I love the tingle from the cleanser, makes my skin feel very fresh after washing. I was afraid that because it seemed to be rather thick and creamy that it wouldn&#x27;t clean effectively but it really did. I have a pretty oily T zone so I&#x27;ve avoided any and all moisturizers because no matter how light they claim to be I feel slimy afterwards. Not at all with this one! I was never prone to acne at all as a teen, and I just started breaking out a bit at 30 and it is leaving marks that don&#x27;t seem to go away at all (I&#x27;m VERY fair, and the marks are sort of reddish brown, like a bigger freckle) so I tried this system. Its only been a few days, and not only is my skin just about clear for the first time in a year, but the marks are fading too! The only drawback is that the spot treatment will bleach fabrics so I am sure to put it on well before changing my clothes or going to bed as to avoid ruining the pillowcases. And a HUGE bonus (to me anyway LOL) is the scent! So many systems out there smell rather medicinal, such as Proactiv, and this one is very light and fresh smelling. All in all, great product, great system, and great value for the money! I&#x27;ll be buying replacements as these run out!</li>
    <li> I ordered this kit about 2 weeks ago. I do have acne marks on my chin and forehead. After about only 2 days of using the product the redness and the size of my acne were reduced. I would highly recommend though that if you have VERY sensitive skin to NOT order this product. It really does burn and irritate my skin a lot. My skin is not sensitive at all, but since I have started using this product my skin has become sensitive. The kit recommends to use it twice a day, but since it is irritating I only use it once a day now. It did leave my cheek red after using it. So I would say it&#x27;s good overall in clearing up acne and acne marks besides the irritation.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit since I need to clear up my adult acne and marks left on from other products. The first week, everything was fine , but no noticeable change (at least my skin was soft). Unfortunately,  week two, my skin was actually burning, and kept on burning weeks after since I continued to use it.  With still no results and my african american skin on fire, I just bought some Clean and Clear OTC products, and the burning instantly stopped. Better off buying Clean and Clear at your local drugstore. I still have acne though, and have since switched to Murad Acne complex.</li>
    <li> Out of the set I only used the cleanser and spot treatment. If you try to use another moisturizer over the spot treatment without letting it dry, weird flakes get all on your skin. All in all a good product just don&#x27;t use the spot treatment with another lotion.</li>
    <li> I was hopeful that this product would help rid me of my acne and those darn red \\&quot;post\\&quot; marks that just never go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I stopped this treatment 3 days ago because my skin was looking and feeling terrible...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin was burning (it felt like I had terrible sunburn), discolored, peeling and I was actually breaking out a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still recovering...my skin feels so tight and when I smile my entire face gets really crinkly! I feel old and disgusting and I am only 23!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to ever be disappointed by anything I buy but this is just one of those products. I would never buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did this do terrible things to my skin, the quality is terrible. When I applied the lotion and the mark treatment, I would have clumpy white residue...it was disgusting to have flaky lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only used this product for two weeks and do not really know if it actually fulfills what it promises but this process was too brutal for me. I didn&#x27;t even want to go out into public because my skin looked so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it will work for you and maybe it won&#x27;t but this is my experience with this. If you can take the pain, go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess the only positive that it has is a pretty box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you still want to try this product after all the negatives in this review and want to save some money...look online for a printable five buck coupon that you can use almost anywhere including wally-world. That&#x27;s what I did...I think I only paid 18 bucks or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take care and good luck</li>
    <li> This product works, and will only work if you have OILY ACNE PRONE SKIN. I have been dealing with acne, ACTUAL acne not just a zit or some pimples since I was 12 and have tried EVERYTHING from Proactiv, Murad, every single product from Clearasil, Cetaphil, Neutrogena, Clean &amp; Clear (yes I was skeptical about trying this because all of their other \\&quot;acne\\&quot; products have never worked), St. Ives, Nature&#x27;s cure, Zapzyt to prescription lotions and scrubs from my actual dermatologist, I even bought a Clarisonic thinking if I used something that would scrub my face then the medicated face washes would actually work! And while the proactiv worked occasionally (not much when I first started using it 10 years ago, but I tried it again last year and it helped a little) this product ACTUALLY WORKS. It is for people with oily acne prone skin and it will dry out your face and make you break out more if you don&#x27;t have OILY acne prone skin.  I had deep painful zits on my chin and cheeks and it took a week of using the Clean &amp; Clear 2 in 1 Acne Mark Eraser Kit for them to go away when it normally would have taken 3 weeks of popping them, applying layer after layer of benzoyl peroxide and hot compresses before they would have scarred and gone away. It works. End of story.</li>
    <li> This product does not work! Save your $! The cleanser makes your skin feel really soft, though..but this whole kit does nothing for acne and acne marks. It also made my lip and eye swell after using it for a week.</li>
    <li> The company gave me my money back because I got a horrible rash from soap washing part...I loved the leave on face creme and if you douse the wash don&#x27;t use it twice a day. Try it just one every 3 or 4 days if you have sensitive skin like mine. Very good product other wise...</li>
    <li> So I began using this product about 2 weeks ago, and have not noticed much of a change in my acne, however my post marks have diminished greatly and almost disappeared! I will continue to use and maybe it will get better, but it was pretty cheap and shipped fast, and makes my skin feel very nice!</li>
    <li> The product just ended up creating more pimples and a big inflammation on my right eye, Product was alright, there are better products than this.</li>
    <li> For a long time I have had trouble with acne kind of like any other usual teenager. (I&#x27;m fourteen and in high school) Mine was never really awful, yet I never had a clear complexion. I had tried numerous acne systems, but out of all of them I&#x27;d have to say that this one worked the best for me. When I first bought this product it came with the four things shown above. The face wash was great because it made my face feel fresh every time I used it. It doesn&#x27;t feel like it is really cleaning deep into your skin, but it actually is. I&#x27;d have to say it&#x27;s one of the best face washes. The only down side is that it dries out your face because the ingredients strip the oil from your skin. Luckily the moisturizer is great because it&#x27;s not heavy and it moisturizes without sitting on top of your skin. And even though it has a 15 SPF (which I love)it doesn&#x27;t give off that sunscreen smell to it like most moisturizers do and instead it smells nice and leaves a thin yet effective layer of moisture on your skin and stays there through the day. The night cream, which is the only product that isn&#x27;t sold on it&#x27;s own is really awesome. It is a somewhat thick white cream that, when it&#x27;s night and your going to bed, you just cover a zit, or maybe a past mark, and in the morning it fades the appearance of the acne noticeably. It&#x27;s hard though because when I wear it to bed, because I have long hair I have to put it a headband to keep the cream away from my hair at night. But other than that I have no complaints. Finally the fast acting zit treatment is also great because in the morning I wake and up wash my face, and then apply it to some of my zits. It gives me a thin protective layer on my zit. Sometimes it will sting though when you put it on, but that lasts about 20 seconds, and really it doesn&#x27;t even hurt that much. Overall I would say that my acne has not reduced 100%, but for this price, and for it to be an over the counter product, it works great. Compared to my 9 or 10 zits I usedto have on my face, I might have 2 at max that are really bad. I do recommend this product with those suffering from acne, and they don&#x27;t have seriously sensitive skin.</li>
