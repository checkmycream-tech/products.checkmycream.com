<li> Yes it did, the only thing that happen is that when I got them they were all wet.</li>

<li> I definitely advise avoiding this product at all cost, even if there was not any other single deodorants in the world.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering fragrance and keeps you dry all day.</li>
<li> Here is a link to the Unilever customer support center.</li>
<li> Honestly I can&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s any worse than any other deodorant concerning the pit stains.</li>
<li> I have used Degree for years, but don&#x27;t like the other scents.</li>
<li> This deodorant, although it smells really good, leaves horrible deodorant stains on just about every shirt.  </li>
<li> so a little pit stainage over time is acceptable to me.</li>
<li> , I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted $20 on these 6 deodorants.</li>
<li> But that one irritated my skin i am not sure why.</li>
<li> We have a hard time finding this in stores.</li>
<li> Now it does slowly cake, or stain, the armpits of your tshirts</li>
<li> I stayed away from Degree for a while because I was so mad that they discontinued this scent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Cant find this in the stores - I love this scent</li>
    <li> Works great. It doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering fragrance and keeps you dry all day.</li>
    <li> What a HUGE LIE this product is. It advertises the deodorant as invisible, while it is anything but invisible. It leaves white stains on all of my shirts. I definitely advise avoiding this product at all cost, even if there was not any other single deodorants in the world. Had I known it&#x27;s not invisible, I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted $20 on these 6 deodorants.</li>
    <li> Why did they have to stop making the one deodorant I&#x27;ve come to love?!?!?  Oh well, if they brought back Arrested Development, maybe they can bring this back, too.</li>
    <li> Nice product and good price and was easy to order on Amazon!  Will continue to purchase...very good value and nice overall scent and effect...does what it should.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this in any stores and my husband insisted he only have this brand and this fragrance.  He&#x27;s a happy camper now.</li>
    <li> For some reason I cannot find this in the big chain stores near my home. Amazon came through with my favorite scent.</li>
    <li> This deodorant, although it smells really good, leaves horrible deodorant stains on just about every shirt.  After one day of use you will see the stains, and they only continue to build up.  Trust me, don&#x27;t order this deodorant</li>
    <li> This is my second type Degree Deodorant I got. The first set i got was the ION Deodorant. But that one irritated my skin i am not sure why. So I got this one to try it and it works perfect. Only problem you have with it is that is cakes up into little tiny snow flakes sometimes beside that is the best one available. Provides the best protector, I mean working straight through all day and you still smell fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> When I wore \\&quot;POWER\\&quot; and hugged people I was asked, often, what I was wearing (I&#x27;m a hugger). I would laugh and tell them it was my deodorant. This is the honest truth. I looooved this scent. I have used Degree for years, but don&#x27;t like the other scents. They either remind me of the locker rooms in high school PE or stuff in the cleaning aisles. I&#x27;ve tried other brands and they aren&#x27;t as effective for me. I stayed away from Degree for a while because I was so mad that they discontinued this scent. It sound silly and trivial - but it isn&#x27;t.    Here is a link to the Unilever customer support center. Use it and let them know you want it back! ;-) [...]</li>
    <li> Good shipping, cheaper than in the stores, and I don&#x27;t smell... Overall, purchasing this item was a success. You have to get the &#x27;power&#x27; stick though,the rest smell like my great-aunt&#x27;s house.</li>
    <li> We have a hard time finding this in stores. So I like that I can buy it in a six pack and at a good price. Discounted 15% with subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the deodorant I like and it&#x27;s in stock.</li>
    <li> Yes it did, the only thing that happen is that when I got them they were all wet. Like if they were melting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of deodorants, and I consider Degree to be the best.  Degree smells great, keeps my pits dry, and has never left a stain.  I don&#x27;t particularly have a preference for any of the scents, as I think they&#x27;re all fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Real person, Leo, NY</li>
    <li> It does cake if you put too much on.  It does stain if you put too much on.  I don&#x27;t care.  I have a very sensitive nose and my husband sweats a lot and has a strong scent.  This is the only scented deodarant that I can tolerate.  So many companies are doing away with Unscented - Degree being one of them - that I have to have a scent I can tolerate. I gave myself a headache yesterday sniffing deodarants to find one I can tolerate.  On a whim, I checked Amazon and found these.  I ordered 18 of them.  If I could, I&#x27;d buy the entire stock.  If I had realized Degree was discontinuing this scent, I would have bought out what I could when it was still in stores.</li>
    <li> I just haven&#x27;t been able to find a good deodorant since stores quit selling this stuff. The biggest reason I like it so much is that I&#x27;ve been at work sweating like a dog for eight hours and I go home to take a shower and my pits still smell like the deodorant, lol, not like bo. Now it does slowly cake, or stain, the armpits of your tshirts but my tshirts still last a year or two. Honestly I can&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s any worse than any other deodorant concerning the pit stains. My big thing is not smelling like I never even put deodorant on at the end of the day so a little pit stainage over time is acceptable to me.</li>
    <li> Exceeded expectations.</li>
    <li> Best dry protection deodorant ever for my husband. He&#x27;s tried several brands and this one holds him longer and better. I would recommend this brand to anyone.</li>
    <li> Degree is the first deodorant/anti perspirant that I have purchased that gives you long lasting odor and sweat protection. Put it on once in the morning and it lasts all day.  I now use this brand and nothing else.  This is a decent price for a 6 pack.</li>
