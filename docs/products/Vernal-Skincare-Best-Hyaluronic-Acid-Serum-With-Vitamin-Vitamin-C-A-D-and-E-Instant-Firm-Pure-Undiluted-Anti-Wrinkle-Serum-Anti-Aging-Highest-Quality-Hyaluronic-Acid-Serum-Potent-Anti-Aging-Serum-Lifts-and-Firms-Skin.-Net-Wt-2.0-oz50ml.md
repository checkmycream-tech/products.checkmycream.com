<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was torn between rating it 4 stars or 5 stars. It hasn&#x27;t really made a difference around my eyes, although my eyes were just starting to age (I&#x27;m age 40.) HOWEVER - since my mid 20&#x27;s I&#x27;ve had deep lines in my neck. I&#x27;m of average weight but for some reason my neck seemed to have a little age to it. Using this product has actually make the deep lines in my neck almost disappear completely!!! (That&#x27;s why the 5 stars!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I started to see a dramatic difference in my neck, I then started using it on my décolleté area and AGAIN those creases disappeared too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think outside the box - if a product doesn&#x27;t work in one area, it may be a miracle worker in another area.  &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I have been a skin care junkie since the age of 16 and my first pay check, so have tried so many products all over the world. This is wonderful. Does exactly what it says and gives a good base for a moisturizer on top. Love it, love it. Also, not horrendously expensive either</li>
    <li> Used the product for 1 month, never noticed a visible difference. Let you know after 3 months.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, my skin feels so much smoother and softer. I am also amazed at how my skin looks after using this product for a few weeks. I am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> While I cannot say I have DEFINITELY noticed a difference in my skin by using the Vernal Skincare serum...I can say that this coupled with a few other products I&#x27;ve recently started using), my skin looks soooo much better than it has in YEARS!  I attribute some of that to this product.  I am getting ready to order my second bottle.  My ONLY complaint would be that I wish there was more actual product so that I didn&#x27;t have to order it so soon...but compared to other brands, this was well worth the money!  I would definitely recommend, especially if your skin is showing signs of aging like mine was!</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feel great!</li>
    <li> i have just started using this serum a few days ago, and i have already started to see the difference on my skin. it feels more hydrated and more youthful looking, and it improves the texture of my skin, too.</li>
    <li> Great product. This is my second order as I have used it for the last two years.</li>
    <li> Works well, makes your skin feel refreshed and new.</li>
    <li> This is extremely light. My makeup goes over it flawlessly. It smells and feels exactly like a clear face mask that you would put on and peel off. As soon as it starts to dry you can feel it pull your skin. I had bought it because I knew I was going to lose about 20 pounds and didn&#x27;t want to encounter wrinkles, so it was a preventative. What I did not expect was the super deep wrinkles on my forehead disappeared. I have bangs, so they were never really an issue for me, but it is cool they are gone. I did have some fine lines above my lips which I was keeping an eye on. When I put my makeup on I can still see those. I use the tiny little bit left in my left palm to spread on the back on my right hand when finished applying to my face. I do see a big difference between the 2 hands now. I am almost finished with my first bottle. I am using no other wrinkle preventative and am only using this in the morning. I would imagine the results would be twice as good if I used it twice as often, but I am just not that disciplined at this point in my life.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin look even worse, more wrinkles, to much lifting.Does not mosturize at all, I am 32 with dry skin, maybe for different type is ok.</li>
    <li> The product works very well. I&#x27;m happy with it&#x27;s results. My skin tightens up feeling refreshed , soft and most importantly .. Firm!</li>
    <li> It has witch hazel it it so it has a refreshing feeling.  It gives my skin a little more rosy color but does need a follow-up of a good moisturizer.  As for making me look younger,maybe as I use it longer.  It has the right ingredients.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase of this face cream. It has helped my skin look flawless. I&#x27;ve been told that my pores look smaller and my skin looks youthful. I have noticed that my skin never feels sticky after applying this cream which is great because the other cream I&#x27;ve tried in the past never felt like they truly absorbed. I will for sure be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better than a lot of other skin care products..</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for almost a week and was pleasantly surprised at the results already.  I had noticed deep groves on my forehead and was getting very upset over them.  The serum has already deplinished the look of these lines to where I can barely see them.  I plan to definitely keep using it on my face and I have also applied it to my neck.  To date I like the results!!</li>
    <li> Lots of skincare products out there but this one really worked for me. Been using for a few weeks now and am more than happy with the results. I&#x27;ll certainly be sticking with this for future purchases as well.</li>
    <li> I am a bit of a product junkie. I wanted to use a bit of retinol again so I went with this product. I read a lot of reviews and thought this might be moisturizing as well. I find the tightening tingling sensation to be more of a drying feeling. I do agree with someones review that it would be good for men. In terms of it is working or not I am not sure. For the price I would definitely say that there are a host of other products out there that I prefer. Clinique laser results or epionce to name a couple. I am not sure what inspired me to switch; I must have been thinking I needed something more that day or read a recent blurb on retinols magic effects. I am going to continue to use this until it is gone I am just not in love for the price. I do like the vernol eye product better than the serum.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. I am in my early 20s and my skin type is dry. Throughout my teens I suffered from acne, which has left me with some serious dullness in the texture. My skin needed a lift, and this was it! It takes some time. It it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve used that I actually noticed a difference with. I use it I. The morning under my moisturizer and at night before bed!</li>
    <li> I have been using this about 3 weeks but I don&#x27;t see any great change in my skin. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have hurt me - no rashes or anything although the first time I used it I apparently had a bite or small cut on my cheek because it really burned.</li>
    <li> Very effective!  Great Price</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic skin care product which really works.</li>
    <li> Received this cream yesterday. Used it twice. Can already feel the difference in my skin. So glad I received this as a gift to give a review</li>
    <li> I used this and while it feels really nice, I don&#x27;t notice a difference of my skin. I fully expect that to change given more time. I will update my review in one month.</li>
    <li> Test this out for a week, I use it nightly with my hot/cold infuser. Feel my face is much firmer and not as dry. I also notice my skin is brighter, I&#x27;m assuming is all the vitamin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I RECIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HOBEST REVIEW***</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Vernal Skincare for about a week now and love the way it goes on and leaves my skin feeling great.  I follow up with a moisturizer and have already noticed some signs of improvement in my skin.  Definitely would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Exceptional Service and love the product. Will buy over and over again!</li>
    <li> It did not make a dramatic difference on my skin appearance. Feels refreshing when put on first.</li>
    <li> Love it!Skin feels moisturised but firm!</li>
    <li> Works well. Happy w this purchase.</li>
    <li> After using this for a week I notice a difference in my skin. I have pretty difficult skin including rosacea, acne and an oily t-zone. I love this product and my skin already looks great! I highly recommend this :)</li>
    <li> This is a very good serum, although for some people, it&#x27;s pricey. But it&#x27;s worth the money because it works. I could notice the difference immediately after one day use. Plus, all the ingredients were effective so even though you have sensitive skin, there won&#x27;t be any irritation. All I can say is that this serum is amazing. It is first serum I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I was skeptical at first but after 2 weeks of usage, my skin glows and becomes smoother. I will definitely restock this after I&#x27;m done with my current bottle!</li>
    <li> Love this, makes your face look smoother. Need to apply to clean skin every day.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical bu this is really a great product!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is now my go-to for winter (please don&#x27;t discontinue it!). I highly recommend giving it a try if your skin is anything like mine. Absorbs quickly and does not clog my pores. This is all I need in the morning after cleansing my face. it restores moisture and protects my skin with antioxidants.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product. The lines around my eyes are gone and facial skin feels much tighter. Will continue to use along with other moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of serum and have tried many different brands. This is hands down my favorite yet. It is lightweight and spreads evenly across your face. The amount needed for each use is very small so one bottle lasts several months. Wrinkles have been reduced and the serum holds my makeup in place throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I love it. My skin looks tighter and  brighter. I simply glow. I would definitely recommend it to any other ladies in their mid 40s.</li>
    <li> A couple of months ago I tried the Vernal Hyaluronic Acid Serum, the Repair Care Eye Gel and the Anti Aging Moisturizing Cream. I waited until I&#x27;d used all the products before writitng a review. I used 1 pump of the serum on my face and 1 pump on my neck, 1/2 pump of the eye gel around my eyes and 1 pump each of the Moisturizing Cream on my face /neck, each morning. The Moisturizing Cream lasted for 2 months and the Serum and Gel lasted for 3 months. My 50-year old skin is combination, but leans more toward the oily. I have trouble finding skin care that moisturizes without clogging pores, feeling heavy or leaving me too greasy. Vernal smells great, feels very good on my skin and does a great job of providing the moisture my skin needs without clogging my pores or causing breakouts. In fact, my breakouts are much less frequent with this skincare. In the winter, sometimes I would add a very light layer of Alba Oil-free moisturizer since the Moisturizing Cream didn&#x27;t always seem to be enough. But in the summer I think I&#x27;ll be fine. I usually moisten my fingers with water before applying the Cream because it spreads a little better. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with these products and I have ordered them all again.</li>
    <li> Sorry but I&#x27;m allergic to one or more of the ingredients</li>
    <li> The only problem with this product, There was no information with this product so I&#x27;m not sure how often I should use it.</li>
    <li> SO FAR SO GOOD..I CAN SEE A DIFFERANCE...MAY ORDER MORE AT THIS RATE.  :)</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect. Very pleased with the product and your customer service! Instantly felt a &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; of the skin, upon first use!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 months now and really see the difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance.  The pores are definitely smaller and it works really well on oily skin.  I really like the way this feels and the way it has smoothed out my skin over the past few months.  It does really look more refreshed than before.</li>
    <li> Probably my top favorite moisturizer ever! It actually improved the texture of my skin as well( something I was DEFINITELY NEEDING). Before, I had acne all over, dry patches, dis-coloration, and all that good stuff. But now that I&#x27;ve kept using it-- my skin is super soft, rarely dries out, and my acne marks are also fading very slowly:) The fact that I also have combination skin means that moisturizers often do more harm than good. Finally, a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make my skin worse, and better yet, it feels pretty refreshing when applied. I tried this stuff, and it did exactly what it said it would. Dare I say better? Yes I do. You can&#x27;t ask for much more from a product!</li>
    <li> Just opened it! Feels very light, not like other toners and skin firmers. I can almost guarantee I&#x27;ll be buying this product!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 53 yr old male who has lived all my life in Arizona. Lots of sun exposure so I do have some earlier signs of aged skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried numerous moisturizers and hyaluronic combinations without any significant results however, within the first week + of using this product not only did I notice some diminish of wrinkles, but bags under eyes tightened. Another positive was that my wife and a couple other people noticed it. I never mentioned using this particular product to anyone, yet, but will in time - after more significant results. I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this stuff and now wondering how long these effects will last. Honestly if this continues to work as good as it has so far, then this stuff without a doubt is the bomb! Note: I use in the a.m. right after a shower and the p.m. after thouroughly cleaning face - wearing it to bed. Non greasy and after it quickly dries it just leaves face shiny and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> good product. been using for sometime.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent skin tightener and low priced facial serum that really works.!  Surprised me.</li>
    <li> This stuff is terrible.  I had to quit using it because it was drying my face out so bad.  This is NOT a moisturizer!</li>
    <li> i am still trying it out. it seems like it is working but i think it is still to soon to tell but for now i will keep using it!</li>
    <li> After using this product for a week my skin already feels better. I have ordered multiple bottles from other companies but this one has seemed to give the best results fast. I would defiantly recomend this to all you folks who love lotion or skin moisturizers. I will also be ordering a couple more bottles.</li>
    <li> This is a good product! Natural ingredients, it feels great and extremely hydrating on the skin. I have been dealing with an allergic reaction (to something else) so have not had the opportunity to use this on a regular basis yet. I will update my review when I have. Louella</li>
    <li> Not enough stars to do justice for what this product has done for my face!!!  And my neck!!!  My jowls have all but disappeared, and that crease between my nose towards my chin is 70% gone!!  I can tell when I haven&#x27;t used the cream, believe me.  SO GLAD I got it, on my perpetual shopping list!</li>
    <li> Love this product, goes,on smoothly leaving your skin feeling fresh and alive. I use it under my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> My skin feels clean and bright after using this product for one week, the result is amazing. I am so glad the sales associate offered to make me a sample to try it first. I actually got complemented at work. They asked if I had been out in the sun because my skin looked like it had a healthy glow. I use the cleanser with this serum. I need to go back and see what other products they have to offer.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum  I ordered. It arrived promptly,  as promised.</li>
    <li> Very nice serum.  Appears to brighten skin and reduce facial lines. Worth the price.  Easy to apply both morning &amp;amp; night.  Have introduced this product to family and friends and all seem to like it a lot! Moderate price as well!</li>
    <li> Like its companion, Vernal Dark Spot Corrector Cream, it is hard to see enough results to justify the high price. I can find nothing to recommend this after using the entire bottle and not seeing any improvements in the condition, texture or appearance of my skin. Don&#x27;t let the claims mislead you.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! It seems to seep into my skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue and I can&#x27;t feel it on my face. It doesn&#x27;t require much to cover my face. A little goes a long way. After a few weeks of using this I&#x27;ve noticed that fine lines around my t-zone are less visible and my skin stays hydrated longer.</li>
    <li> I can actually feel this product firming! It doesn&#x27;t last all day, though. Perhaps you have to pay twice the price to get that effect or.... I will say that for the first time someone commented on how great my skin looked with no makeup.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see a real big change in my skin, like the other reviews claim. It does leave my skin soft. I give it credit to be a good product and I will continue using what I have left and take it from there!</li>
    <li> Product arrive on schedule, is easy to use and feels good on my skin.  However, it is too early to determine whether it is producing any of the results anticipated.</li>
    <li> developed allergy to product: found know the source was it..</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying the Vernal skincare products. I have sensitive skin and have not had problems with any of the products. My fine lines and skin look smoother as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using Vernal products for a couple of years &amp; find that Vernal is probably the best on the market now . . . My complexion has gained compliments from several of my friends &amp; family -- That is glows !  . . . My twice-daily routine of Vernal includes :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - Vernal Hyaluronic Acid Serum -with vitamins C, A, D &amp; E;&lt;br /&gt;2 - Vernal N-E Dark Spot Corrector Cream;&lt;br /&gt;3 - Vernal Anti Aging Moisturizer Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - I became aware of the fact that Vernal Hyaluronic Acid Serum contains Vitamin E as I was using it recently.  If any of you have fillers in your face ---- This is a NO - NO - NO.  In fact, Physicians will advise to eliminate all Vitamin E  ---  orally &amp; topically --- It shortens &amp; diminishes any medical procedure done to the face --- It is detrimental to any facial procedure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 - I fell on the right side my face a couple of years ago when a stool collapsed on a concrete dock --- Ugh !  I do believe the Vernal N-E Dark Spot Corrector has helped diminish the darkness of the scar --- It is not gone -- However, I honestly believe that  the spot corrector has really helped in lightening the scar &amp; I will continue to use.  In fact, I just ordered 2 bottles of it today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 - Vernal Anti-Aging Moisturizing Cream --- I love this stuff !  It feels soooo good with the Peptides --- And the vitamins contained in it are wonderful for your skin.  It is perfect for my skin type -- somewhat combination -- not dry; not overly oily.  The vitamins contained in this product are very, very good for your face.  I will definitely continue to use this product --- I just ordered 3 bottles today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I love all of Vernal&#x27;s above three products, with the exception of Hyaluronic Acid Serum containing Vitamin E -- Hopefully, the Vitamin E will be eliminated from their formula in the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  I am basically a, &amp;#34;product junkie&amp;#34; who loves good products -- And Vernal will continue to be my, &amp;#34;main-stay&amp;#34; in my facial routine.  We all must take care of our skin --- We cannot replace it !  I highly recommend Vernal !</li>
    <li> Does not do what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and I have to say so far so good.I am happy with the quality of this product and it seems to be doing what it&#x27;s supposed to.I will update this review as I near the end of the tube and I am confident I will still be liking if not loving this product.Very happy I got it and I look forward to great results!!! I have changed my rating due to lack of ability to contact the seller directly.I used the product and after the first use I was happy with it(I use various vitamin C products and this seemed to be a good one)Unfortunately the dispenser broke and I tries several times to either get a replacement or just a pumper and this issue could not be addressed,my only option is to send it back for a refund not a replacement.A simple pump would have made me happy.Any contact with the seller would have made me happy.I will use the product without the dispenser and I am not at all happy about that and will not buy it again knowing these types of issues cannot be resolved.I love A,azon and this is no fault of theirs,they did everything they could.</li>
    <li> My skin feels softer after using this product for a couple of weeks.  I do not see any difference in my fine lines or wrinkles.</li>
    <li> It absorbs quickly, no sticky residue. Have only tried a few days, but so far I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin.  Certainly no &amp;#34;firmer.&amp;#34;  Oh well.  Someday they may make a miracle in a serum but this isn&#x27;t it.  I give it three stars because at least it&#x27;s not overpriced.</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  Alot is out there on the market and this is one of my favorites! ! I have tried many.</li>
    <li> Only been using it a couple weeks so it is hard to say at this point if it&lt;br /&gt;does what it says it will. However, so far I am pleased with it. It goes on&lt;br /&gt;smooth. Very silky, seems to absorb quickly and definitely tightens the skin.&lt;br /&gt;At this point I do believe I like it very much and most likely will reorder.</li>
    <li> Just started using this and so far I think that it is helped :-)</li>
    <li> love it, same as above not much product for the price.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It is a great skin firming tool.  It also gives me a nice glow to my skin.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough of this product. My skin is oily and I have a difficult time getting a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin prone to breakouts, this is a miracle product, I can see the small lines specially around the cheeks and forehead vanishing. I definitely found a product that satisfies my needs.</li>
    <li> Love it Have been using it a week and can already see results.</li>
    <li> Goes on light...to early to detect a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I love  it .</li>
    <li> I see a definite improvement..especially around my mouth..highly recommend! Sales are not pushy which makes it easy to order.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over a month.  I love it!!  It feels light on the skin but best of all the overall appearance of my skin has improved to the point that I am using almost no makeup.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Goes on amazingly smooth and feels great.  I am noticing a tightening effect but I haven&#x27;t had the product long enough to say more at this time.  I apply it after cleansing at night  and in the AM.  It does work well under make-up.</li>
    <li> I bought this two weeks ago and decided to test it out by using it on one half of my face and using a Lancome product on the other half. Today I examined each side both in a magnifying mirror and by taking photos and zooming in on them, and was amazed to find that the area under and around my eye on the Hyaluronic Acid Serum side had significantly fewer fine lines and that the skin was smoother looking, as well as being smoother to the touch. I was skeptical, but it really made a visible difference in just two weeks!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 6 months and absolutely love it. I have noticed a vast improvement on how my skin looks on my face and hands. The elasticity and the texture has shown a noticeable improvement. My pores appear smaller also. I will continue to use this product in the future.</li>
    <li> Loving this product and quick shipping</li>
    <li> This actually one of the better hyaluronic serums I&#x27;ve ever used.  I combine with my moisturizer in the morning and my skin is feeling softer!</li>
    <li> Finally, at almost 60 years of age and trying hundreds of products, I found this moisturizer which is perfect for my combination/oily skin. It is lightweight, absorbs rapidly, and keeps my face soft and smooth without ever becoming greasy during the day and calms any redness due to my rosacea and sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for awhile. I have noticed a big difference in my skin. . It has a subtle illuminating quality making skin appear more youthful. I get an immediate smooth sleek texture to my skin...very touchable. After 3 weeks, my skin has never looked better!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Noticed results almost immediately. Exfoliate occasionally while using this and you get amazing results. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I use it with unrefined ivory Shea Butter, Glysolid Glycerine cream, and 2-3 drops of Lemon Oil.... LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;Great Moisutrizer in the combination above</li>
    <li> I have been using this now for a around three weeks and absolutely love this product. I purchased 3 more of these at their website the other day so I would not run out. During the day, I apply this first, let it dry and then continue w/my regime such as applying a moisturizer on top. My skin feels firm and tight but not dry which gives me this youthful look. At night, I just slather this on. It&#x27;s a wonderful product ladies. It so diminishes my fine lines in the jowl area. To me, this product is like gold. I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> this works as well as the Trish McEvoy eye treatment and costs half as much!  I used Trish for about 6 months and liked it.  I have used this for about 6 weeks with the same results.  I would say that this product and also the face product need to be used with the moisturizer though.</li>
    <li> left my skin soft over night! perfect under makeup</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the whole bottle yet but I think it&#x27;s pretty good maybe not as good as Nerium but not as expensive also.</li>
    <li> great product, skin is soft and not greasy anymore like lotions .</li>
    <li> Worthless!!  Do even think of buying this stuff.  Does absolutely nothing at all.  I have used it faithfully for 3 weeks and no improvement at all.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t help but notice that none of these rave reviews on this product are certified Amazon purchases which is the number one indicator of fake reviews. Just saying... buy at your own risk knowing this.</li>
    <li> Nice product to apply to skin, but unsure if it does anything at all -- no noticeable difference after using the whole container.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Vernal Skincare-Best Hyaluronic Acid Serum for one week, once a day.  The packaging was appropriate and not too big--it fit inside my locked mail box and avoided the heat of the front porch.  Unfortunately there were no instructions or any type of material to go with the product to guide me on how much to put on--how many times a day etc...I&#x27;m fairly experienced with product so I went with 1-2 pumps and enough product came out to cover my whole face and whole neck.  LET THIS DRY before moving on to other products--of course putting it on a clean face helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main area of concern is the newly forming lines stemming from my lips, mostly off the bottom lip.  I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen a difference in one week and honestly I don&#x27;t have deep deep wrinkles--I&#x27;m very lucky, being in my forties.  I will update this review as more time passes with the use of this product.  It seemed to be a great base under &amp;#34;CC&amp;#34; eye coverage cream and creamy blush (NARS-&amp;#34;Orgasm&amp;#34;).  I absolutely notice the texture of my skin is much softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product for approximately $27 - $29 which was a &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; and I think this price is much more appropriate for the size of the bottle than upwards of $40 I&#x27;ve seen it listed for since.  I&#x27;m very interested in trying the Moisturizer but waiting to see if I can get a coupon or it goes on sale.  All in all--when we spend money on ourselves we are more likely to use the product we buy vs..falling asleep in old makeup--so ANY skin care, especially removing the makeup and moisturizing at night and putting SPF on in the day--will ultimately help fight signs of aging vs. neglect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product because there is no awful smell and no oily residue.  Some reviewers mention their skin felt &amp;#34;tightened&amp;#34; as the product was drying--and I did notice this but after it dries--the effect is natural--I don&#x27;t like feeling like my face has a mask on it anyway.  It is July 27, 2015 and Iwill check back in one month!</li>
    <li> Just OK - no miracle but no issues either...</li>
    <li> Geez Louise! I can&#x27;t believe I just said that! LOL!! But it&#x27;s so true. I had toners, and different facial cleaners, moisturizers for the eyes - one 4 day/one 4 night, another moisturizer for my face - one 4 day/one 4 night - Whew!! Incredible! Now, I simply use Shiseido Benefiance Foaming Facial Cleanser, then Shiseido Eudermine, and then the Vernal Skincare Hyaluronic Acid Serum with the Vernal Skincare Moisturizer and that&#x27;s it! Plus, I have no breakouts from harsh products (which is why I keep switching and trying new products) and my skin looks &amp; feels GREAT! Kudos Vernal Skincare! &amp;#60;3 U!</li>
    <li> Have been  using this for a few months - really like how quickly it absorbs, doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, my skin likes it so far, looks better.</li>
    <li> Perfection! Smooth and silky!!</li>
    <li> While it&#x27;s a bit more than I want to spend on a skincare product, I have to say that I&#x27;ve never felt better about a product on my face, it&#x27;s light and refreshing but it feels like it is doing something, and while if you&#x27;re going in the sun you&#x27;ll want to put on a sunblock protector over it, it&#x27;s perfect for daily use/ around the house, or in northern or cloudy climates. In Miami, like I first use this, then put on a Neutrogena or Oil of Olay product with spf  to go out for the day. I have dry and sensitive skin, so it seems perfect for that.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at a reduced price to give an honest opinion. I have being using this product for about a week now and notice a huge difference! My face feels rested and refreshed. My skin is smooth and I have noticed a significant difference in age spot reduction as well as wrinkles and age lines being reduced. Great product!!</li>
    <li> In a short amount of time this product has really made its way into my daily facial routine. I have sensitive skin and this stuff just glides on quickly and smoothly and works wonderful as a base before the cream (or my other cheaper lotions when I want to conserve my life saving products), my makeup, or I use it all by itself a lot when my skin feels like it&#x27;s getting dry, period. It also makes your skin silky smooth and does wonders for dry skin. I have been using this product for about a week and I haven&#x27;t found anything bad about it yet.</li>
    <li> Started using this product twice a day in December. Within 2 weeks I could see a difference. Now it is May and I am amazed. This product gives what it claims. And it is lab tested.</li>
    <li> And I might add the extra star in a few weeks after a better test period.  How a products feels and acts are the parameters I can already determine. A &amp;#34;foreign&amp;#34; substance would sit on skin and not absorb. The ingredients in this serum are instantly absorbed and the feel on my skin is at least as good as anything else I have used.  My face feels very very smooth,  maybe an unscientific test,  but it at least &amp;#34;agrees&amp;#34; with my skin and my face seems much smoother,  as though I have returned to skin much younger than my 64 years.  I have inherited good skin but know that abuse and lack of care could quickly reverse any positive condition.  Will probably keep using this product as my best after-cleansing treatment.</li>
    <li> This product made my skin feel sticky and taut. I didn&#x27;t like anything about it. I was looking for something reasonably priced so gave this a try but will definitely be sticking with the pricier product I normally use. Big difference. I do not recommend and honestly, I am sort of surprised at all the high reviews.  I don&#x27;t get it.  .</li>
    <li> Did not notice much difference. Kind of dried out my skin. Using the Serum Vitamin C  with  Hyaluronic Acid works so much better for me.</li>
    <li> I am in the process of reordering Vernal’s Hyaluronic Acid Serum and Anti-Aging Moisturizer.  I began using the products on March 7 and notice a significant difference in my 51 year old complexion. My skin feels tighter and wrinkles are diminishing.</li>
    <li> I have found that this gives a firming effect &amp; minimizes lines.</li>
    <li> I have been using this item for about a  month. I don&#x27;t really see a fantastic change in lines around my mouth or forehead. Probably would not but again for the price.</li>
    <li> This is my second Vernal product. I use it every other night underneath firming anti-wrinkle oil free moisturizer. My skin needs moisture and this products feels very good under my eyes and have even used it over my whole face. It absorbs very quickly. I notice that it plumps up my skin and hydrates it. I have \\&quot;aged\\&quot; skin and honestly I don&#x27;t expect anything to work miracles. So at this point I just want to slow the process down.</li>
    <li> I have only been using product for about 5 days and don&#x27;t see any change in my skin</li>
    <li> Omg. This stuff is amazing!!!!! I can see a huge improvement in my skin and it has been only a few weeks. It will be my #1 skin care from now on. Yes!!!! I&#x27;ll buy It again.</li>
    <li> I simply Love this product, I&#x27;ve been using it on my skin and it works great. I will be purchasing more for my friends and family!</li>
    <li> This serum is fabulous!  It makes my skin look and feel amazing!</li>
    <li> I have been using hyaluronic acid product as part of my daily skincare and I received this one as a sample.  This serum is light-weighted but is more concentrated than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t really tell as the bottle was defective and I got no response on recieving another bottle.  there is no stem attached to pump so I can&#x27;t get product out without taking lid off and pound into my palm.  is there anyway I  could get another bottle and I will return this barely used bottle.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by some of the big beauty vloggers out there but little did I know it would work as well as it has. With this product there is definitely a noticeable difference. My moisturizer absorbs better and my skin feel less peel-y that I got with other serums. I apply this after patting my skin dry and just let it sit on my face for the rest of the day and the difference it has made is beyond words. The only problem I have is that it doesn&#x27;t do much for the under eyes. I would recommend this to anyone who takes their aging skincare issues seriously. Great stuff and worth the price!!!</li>
    <li> Love this eye gel. Will order again. Goes on smoothly and even better under eye concealer goes on and stays on. It won&#x27;t slide off like with other eye creams/gels.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend Best Hyaluronic Acid Serum by Vernal Skincare. Absorbs very fast, softens fine lines and wrinkles. Softens skin reduces pore  size.  Love, love love it.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used it that long but my skin feels smoother and I would purchase it again</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast. Product was sealed just like it was stated. Haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my face yet. But it&#x27;s only been using it for a week.very easy transaction.</li>
    <li> Works for me.  Not a miracle cure, but it does seem to improve the texture of my skin.  The company is reliable and I would shop with them again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a week but am noticing some tightening! I like the consistency too. Looking forward to more results in future too!</li>
    <li> this works good i would def recommend this product to anyone it does make my skin smooth not all nasty feeling like other brands i also recieved a discount from snagshout for this product thank you for a great product</li>
    <li> Skin has looked heaps better after using this product</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle and LOVE this stuff.  Wrinkles around my eyes have significantly diminished.  My face feels taught after I put it on and let it dry - then I put on my daily cream.  BTW - I do not work for this company, just a 52 year old looking for a good Hyaluronic Acid serum that is less expensive than the dermatologist!  No issues with shipping, packaging, pump, etc.</li>
    <li> The dispenser (pump) does not work right so I have been wasting the product trying to get the serum out..  That&lt;br /&gt;I am not happy about considering the cost of the product.</li>
    <li> Love the products.  I can see a noticeable difference in skin tone, and wrinkles are not as pronounced.  Will continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> This product is no better than any of the others I&#x27;ve tried.  After one month I see no improvement at all.</li>
    <li> love this product. The feel the flow and how it makes my skin feel and look</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping. I have been using different brands of anti-aging products for many years. I have also had Juvederm ( facial filler) which is a ( hyaluronic acid) filler injected into my face a few years back.  I&#x27;m a 38 year old male in the entertainment business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know my stuff when it comes cosmetics, and the ingredients that SHOULD be in them to help in the Anti-Aging process! first off What is Hyaluronic acid??  It is a substance that is naturally present in the human body, Hyaluronic acid works by acting as a cushion and lubricant in the joints and other tissues. having the Vitamins C, A, D &amp; E, in this serum is fantastic.One of the most powerful functions of vitamin C is its role in the production of collagen, a protein that gives your skin its elasticity. As you age, collagen breaks down and wrinkles begin to form. Stabilizing your skin’s levels of vitamin C can help to counteract wrinkle formation by increasing collagen production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so do yourselves a favor, stop being indecisive and scared. You found what you are looking for. This company is awesome!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will the company give me a deal? ;-) just kidding.  because I definitely will be reordering their products. ( no deals needed)</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It instantly tightens my skin, and even though I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles yet, I can see the difference it makes.  I was surprised how inexpensive it is, I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> Have not seen any &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; results but I think that may be happening. I really like the &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; hyaluronic acid best.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used but a couple of weeks but my skin feels smoother already.  Also, I was surprised at the size of the container. Much larger than expected. Should last for a while!! Good product!! Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying I LOVE this serum! It smells &amp; feels incredibly good as it glides over your face and sinks into your skin. I first got a free sample &amp; then just had to buy a whole bottle and now - I&#x27;m hooked! Really helps minimize those fine lines and adds a wonderful glow to your skin.</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with this product! I have always had very oily skin but at age 55 I now have some dryness. Most moisturizers make me break out and those made for oily skin don&#x27;t provide enough moisture. I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see results for at least a month after first using it (if at all) but, to my great surprise, I started noticing a significant reduction in the depth of the lines around my mouth and on my cheeks within a week. I was stunned. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of moisturizers and serums in my lifetime and this is the first one that lives up to its claims.</li>
    <li> I been using this serum for two weeks straight and my 65-year-old skin loves this product. It provides me with an instant moisture and a smooth surface for the application of all makeup--or none if you prefer. While I use a more heavy-duty product for day time for SPF protection, this is my favorite daytime moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I am on my second  bottle, I really like it,  my skin looks great, very few wrinkles at 55..make sure you spritz your face with water or something hydrating.  I use an equalizing spray after use. And a very good moisturizer to lock it all in. I definitely see a difference over time for sure. Great item to add to my facial routine.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin soft and supple for the day and I see results of tighter and firmer skin every time I use it, lines are diminishing.</li>
    <li> So I was one of the lucky few to receive a sample of the Vernal HA serum . I have been using it for 2 weeks  now. I have tried many different products to help with the lines on my forehead and nothing even comes close to what you products can do. I wake up every morning and I can&#x27;t believe the results. The lines are almost gone. Thank you so much for the samples. I was tired of wasting my money on products that don&#x27;t deliver. I have just ordered the full size of both products. I really wish I had found Vernal products a long time ago.</li>
    <li> THIS is the most wonderful stuff I&#x27;ve ever used .....you can even have it on and nobody in the world would know its just unbelievable ......its about time they came out with a moistuizer thzts undetectable for guys to wear  without feeling like everybody know what you&#x27;ve got on and its not  heavy like a nitetime moisturizer either....its just really kool for guys</li>
    <li> It actually works. I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks. My skin is much smoother and my pores are remarkably smaller. I still have a lot of product left in my bottle but just went ahead with my reorder so I won&#x27;t have to be without it when my bottle is empty.</li>
    <li> You always are unsure when wrinkle creams make ridiculous claims.  I have tried this serum for 2 weeks now and I do believe I can see a slight difference.  I mainly have light wrinkles under my eyes and Iam 47.  You do have to use this morning and night.  However I think it&#x27;s worth a try, better then most creams!</li>
    <li> This Hyaluronic Acid Serum really worked for me, and I&#x27;m being very honest. I put it on after cleansing my face and within 30 seconds I could actually feel my skin firming up. And when I look in the mirror, I can see the difference, it is definitely firmer. I wait for about one minute then I apply the Vernal anti- aging moisturizer, my skin looks and feel wonderful. I apply these two products before bedtime and during the day only if I&#x27;m going out. I have used other Hyaluronic Acid but this is the best.</li>
    <li> I used a whole bottle of this product &amp; I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s worth the money. I see no difference in my skin since the I started using it.Wish I could say more that was positive but.... sorry.</li>
    <li> First of all, when I received the serum, I was impressed with the bottle...it has a classy look. The serum is gel-like, so unlike some others, it stays in place until you smooth it on.  It has a subtle scent, not overpowering. It goes on smoothly, and it makes my skin feel very soft. My dermatologist told me that hyaluronic acid actually attracts moisture to the skin surface and makes your moisturizer even more effective. I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t expect these kinds of products to work but I can&#x27;t stop myself from buying them. I read the claims and think to myself, &amp;#34;right.&amp;#34; And then I buy it anyway. Forever hopeful, I guess. So obviously I&#x27;ve been disappointed a few times. But I have to say, this time I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. This is a very cool product. It says in the description that it makes the skin produce its own natural collagen. I don&#x27;t know if it does that or not but it&#x27;s doing something. I&#x27;ve started taking pictures because based on the results I&#x27;ve had so far, after three days, I&#x27;ll be able do a fairly dramatic before and after shot. I can clearly see the dark areas under my eyes improving and small wrinkle lines disappearing. And I really like the way my skin feels after I use it, as ridiculously cliche as that sounds. I really do!. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product about three weeks now. My skin  seems to have a subtle glow about it, and instead of a more dry and sallow feel, it has a softer and more healthy, youthful feel. I see and feel positive results from using this product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Tightens and smooths</li>
    <li> This is my first time to use your product. I have not used it for over a week, but not daily. about 3 times a week. I am very happy with the results it has given me. I have even recommended it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I can definitely see a difference! I have searched high and low for an anti-aging moisturizer that won&#x27;t irritate. After a few weeks of using this product I can say my skin feels moisturized and shows less signs aging. Current fine lines are less visible and it absorb immediately, never leaves skin greasy but work to keep skin hydrated amazingly well. I&#x27;m hooked, part of my daily skin regimen.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I feel this serum is evening out my skin tone and improving my complexion.</li>
    <li> I have use this product a couple of times; I think it is improving my skin; I liked the photos I&#x27;ve seen and hope that the stuff is working and my photo has not been photoshopped</li>
    <li> I think it is doing better. Patience is the word.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer provides the perfect combination of regeneration properties. I really like the texture and scent. It feels great with no stinging and no break outs. My fine lines seem less visible.I find that it really improves my skin&#x27;s overall appearance, and it&#x27;s reduced my dependence on makeup.</li>
    <li> This serum is one of the best I have tried!  Love it and will continue to use it for a long time!  Give it a try and you won&#x27;t want to use another serum  :)</li>
    <li> Day three of using this product, and I can already see a difference... Or is it just fooling my eyes by hiding the wrinkles? I don&#x27;t know, and I don&#x27;t care. My skin looks younger and firmer, and I am quite pleased. Today, I didn&#x27;t even bother putting on my foundation!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin look and feel new.</li>
    <li> Started using this about a few months ago and love it. It works for me. My skin feels moisturized and shows less aging. This stuff makes my skin look flawless. All the fine lines, gone. All the uneven skin tone, gone. But the thing that sells me is the texture it makes my skin. After a week, my skin looks like I have a primer on and I don&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> This stuff is truly a miracle in a tube!!! My fine lines are far less noticeable. My skin is silky and much smoother. I never thought I would find a moisturizer that was as effective as this one. I will definitely purchase this again and again.</li>
    <li> I have not see enough difference in my skin to justify the expense of any of the Vernal products. I doubt I will order them again.</li>
    <li> Recently bought and have used for three days only and already see a difference in my skin. It seems softer and more glowing, fine lines are less noticeable. I was using Caudalie cream, which I do love, but felt I had reached the maximum benefit with it and wanted something that would firm a bit more. So far I&#x27;m loving this serum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this 5 days now, not greasy you can feel your skin tighten.  Face feels soft</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer that absorbs quickly, makes my skin look soft without causing breakouts, This is the best product I&#x27;ve used for diminishing the look of lines and wrinkles. The texture is very light, it is not thick at all. Goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. I feel that it evens my skin tone slightly, it&#x27;s noticeable to me, however I doubt colleagues &amp; friends would really notice. It does moisturize well.</li>
    <li> Gently reveals smooth fresh looking skin and makes those age spots slowly disappear.</li>
    <li> Product works as expected, I think. Too soon to tell. However, I did not know purchasing it would put me on an email marketing list and that I would receive multiple emails a day about this purchase. I haven&#x27;t had this happen with Amazon purchases before. Very irritated.</li>
    <li> Just received my order but when I look in the list of ingrendents no where do I see any vitamins listed that it states it has.</li>
    <li> Have a cabinet thats full of promises from companies that fell short .This product is the best so far have seen my skin and wrinkles get so much better will buy this again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This serum is everything it was promised to be...as advertised. The serum helped me tighten my skin up significantly. The service was prompt and I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love it but the pump stop working so I have to send it back,i hope this one works because I love it</li>
    <li> works very well, never going to remove all but softened creases and wrinkles a lot.</li>
    <li> Was pleasantly surprised! I&#x27;m skeptical of many health and beauty products. However, there was a noticeable difference in my face and neck within a couple of weeks. I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still not sure about this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed much difference yet.  It may be wishful thinking, but my skin does feel smoother, but really doesn&#x27;t look any different.  I will probably buy it again just to see if it takes a couple of months to make a difference.</li>
    <li> Overall a tremendous product.  Would recommend it to those who are looking for skincare products.  Absolutely would buy again! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> This serum has FINALLY brought balance to my combination skin. I don&#x27;t get greasy during the day and only have to apply a small amount in the morning. This improves skin tone and moisturize perfect, not too much not too little. Skin feels smooth without feeling greasy. No breakouts and can be used under any other product. Great product, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Been using this 3 weeks.  Softened my skin right away.  Appears to be minimizing wrinkles around mouth.  I plan to continue using.</li>
    <li> It seems to do the job. I noticed the fine lines have disappeared and my skin is smooth. Easy application. When it dries, it does feel a little tight so I put some high quality crème on top to alleviate the pulling sensation. Other than that, I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> amazing product ordered another bottle</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! I&#x27;m 46 years old and this serum has improved the overall appearance of my skin as well as minimizing my fine lines and morning eye puffiness. I have been using the Vernal skincare products for about 4 months and continue to see improvement. Although it is a bit pricey, it is definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> Dries on the surface of your skin to tighten it. That’s about all it does!</li>
    <li> have been used many different serums on and off. With that said. this is an amazing serum, I can feel my skin getting tighter after a few second. Skin texture is improving and fine lines becoming less visible! Definitely can&#x27;t wait to see the results with continued use!I will recommend it. People said the pump on the bottle is not a smooth pumper, I did not experience this issue.. By the way, this is a second bottle that I have ordered.</li>
    <li> After only 10 days, the texture of my skin feels supple and the fine lines around my eyes are diminished! I am 49 and use the repair wear laser focus serum and this new product works more rapidly! With three weeks of use, I continue to see the glow and my complexion looks more even and fine lines are even less noticeable. I have been a user of the spot correcting serum for a few years, and have loved it. I cannot say enough about this serum. If you are going to invest in one product for your skin, make it this serum -- you will not be sorry. My only negative comment is the pump as I enjoy getting every drop of my serum. That said, it is a wonderful product and if you want results, ASAP, purchase this serum!</li>
    <li> Started using this about a week ago and love it. It works for me. My skin feels moisturized and shows less aging. I like the feel of this product on my skin, which is naturally dry (ever since) seemed to be well-nourished and certainly not as dry. I have tried many products in the past, but this, I think is the best for one who has super dry skin. It is very lightweight and absorbs quickly. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a great serum.  Lots of good skin vitamins. Use it AM and PM.  Like to mix it with other serums I use.  Also have been using it as the conductor for my NORLANYA.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive and dry and as I get older i realized I needed something that would help me get moisture for my skin. However, half the creams I try give me acne on my face. I sometimes get stuck avoiding moisturizing that area because all serums give me acne there. With that in mind, I only use it once a day and not even every day and I have noticed my face is bright and more skin complexion is more even, best of all no break outs plus it keeps the skin smooth and soft ( my skin was very bumpy in this area). I plan to purchase the full size once I am finished with my samples.</li>
    <li> I suffer from many skin allergies with many products, and I get occasional dry patches on my face. It&#x27;s hard to find anything that works or that gets rid of redness but this stuff is amazing and did all that for me. My redness and hives are gone, skin tone is even, and my skin is clear :) i&#x27;m happy to say I will not be needing to switch to any other brands!</li>
    <li> Love this serum!  Can feel it tightening my skin!  Will be reordering!</li>
    <li> It helped to improve diminish my fine lines wrinkles</li>
    <li> Upon initial application, I felt the  tightening effects of the serum.  Immediately afterwards, my face felt very smooth!  It&#x27;s a perfect base prior to adding a daily moisturizer.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product a couple of days but I notice a difference already in the tightness of my skin and also my skin is very soft. So far, I think it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> I was obviously  allergic to something in it - turned my cheeks red and itchy.  Sent it back. They were very nice on the phone.  Still waiting for my refund.</li>
    <li> I did not see any changes after using it ...in fact, it made my face feel dry.</li>
    <li> Use on my face every day morning &amp; night.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend for a healthy glow and improved hydration.</li>
    <li> I liked this product..... but just to be clear, It doesn&#x27;t actually doesn&#x27;t get rid of wrinkles, it gets rid of some of the appearance of the wrinkles...</li>
    <li> I LOVE this serum and will be ordering it again.  I am 67 years old and have relatively good skin.  This product, however, tightens my skin enough to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and tightens the under-eye area nicely.</li>
    <li> I been using this product for almost a month now and I&#x27;m very happy with my experience so far. It is very moisturizing, but absorbs easily into your skin so that you don&#x27;t end up feeling greasy. When you first apply it, it does feel light and luxurious, but is somehow really hydrating (within the first few seconds). The smell is fantastic - very fresh and spa-like. I have been very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> This is really a good serum.  It tightens almost immediately.  It lasts about 24 hours and then I have to use it again.  I&#x27;m not sure about long lasting effects as I have only used it for about two weeks. It seems to be a good product. I am 63 so I don&#x27;t expect miracles. I use this in combination with Baby Face and that seems to work well.  My husband, who hasn&#x27;t paid me a compliment in 15 years, told me he thought I had less of a turkey neck lately!!!!  I didn&#x27;t know whether to thank him or throw the bottle at him. Anyway, I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I have ordered it a couple times now. Seems to be working a little, but I&#x27;m not using it consistently. I will probably continue ordering it because I like how it makes your skin feel tight.</li>
    <li> Using it and I haven&#x27;t have any results</li>
    <li> NO NO NO NO DOES NOT WORK!!!! DON&#x27;T WAISTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY</li>
    <li> This product seems to work okay&lt;br /&gt;It makes your skin feel tight.  I have used a lot of different serums and this one is good</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t quite finished the bottle yet but appears to be working fine as part of my skin routine.</li>
    <li> This product in combined with the vitamin C helps to drastically reduce the appearance of folds in the face due to tiredness. I have been using it for a month, but I noticed results in the first three days of use. It has only gotten better since then. I will recommend to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Not for me!!F.y.i people!!! Make sure to read information and warnings.I did not .Went out in the sun and suffered a severe&lt;br /&gt;reaction,very unpleasant!!!</li>
    <li> Nothing really special. I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about 3-4 weeks now. It makes my skin very dry and I need to apply extra moisturizer. No magic affects.</li>
    <li> It sits on top of the skin like a plastic layer, making your skin look pulled.  Haven&#x27;t seen any benefits yet, but maybe I will change my mind after using it longer.</li>
    <li> I could see improvements starting the first time my wife used it.  She loves it.  The wrinkles are now almost non-existent.</li>
    <li> I recently received a sample of this product and I can say I will definitely be going back to purchase the full size. I have eczema and suffer from severely dry skin. I added this to my moisturizer at night along with my night moisturizer on top and it has really helped eliminate any signs of flakiness. Just one pump of the bottle is all I use for each area of my face. What a go to product! My face no longer feels tight and my appearance has greatly benefited from it.</li>
    <li> So happy with this product and seller. I am on my 2nd bottle and plan to continue purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> I will never cheat on this product. It&#x27;s my new MUST HAVE! The lightweight formula soothes my combination skin that is on the dry side now that it is cold out. It also absorbs quickly and goes well on under my moisturizer. After allowing the toner to lightly dry on my face, I apply a dab to my fingers than I apply it to my face. I&#x27;ve noticed in 2+ weeks a fresher look, less dry, fewer wrinkles &amp; a softer feel overall.</li>
    <li> i bought vernal hyaluronic acid my face is so dry, i thought it was pure it has alcohol in it, very disappointed !!</li>
    <li> No pump. Next to impossible to get product out of bottle. I found it very drying to my skin. It contains witch hazel which is an astringent. Not good for my skin at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for almost 2 months now and it has really changed my skin to be the best I&#x27;ve has since my teens. I noticed more wrinkles and skin dullness over the past couple years and spent over $1000 on various lotions and serums trying to find something that changed my skin. My skin is brighter and has less wrinkles. It&#x27;s also a lot smoother. I used to use about 4 different creams or serums but this is now all I need. I will definitely continue to purchase this.</li>
    <li> Great my skin looks fantastic! !</li>
    <li> My skin feels tighter and smoother after using Vernal Skincare. Easy to dispense and apply. I have seen great results since I started using this product a few months ago.</li>
    <li> I have used this for several month and see no real benefit. Will not be buying this overpriced stuff.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t seem to do much and made my face look reddish.</li>
    <li> love it ! This was my third order  I think it works . I use the whole line</li>
    <li> Best one i&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
    <li> This did nothing to firm my skin or reduce my wrinkles.  If you want a suggestion on the best face skin product on the market, give nerium a try.  Nerium is the best firming and wrinkle reducing cream I&#x27;ve ever tried.  People cannot believe I&#x27;m 51.</li>
    <li> Terrible week at work with awful stress bumps around chin, and tired eyes. Serum made my face feel smooth and hydrated, and I would never have believed this, actually calmed and minimized the bumps! I have tried a couple of very expensive creams and, although I liked them, I had a hard time justifying the cost versus the results. I feel this product meets all of my demands - a fantastic product without breaking the bank.</li>
    <li> I like this. A little goes a long way. Quick results for me. I didn&#x27;t have luck with Vernal eye serum- but this facial serum is nice.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t notice any difference</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  IT WORKS and works well for me.  I have tried many wrinkle reducing, smoothing, plumping products and this one is the one for me!</li>
    <li> I believe the product itself is 5 star!  However, the pump applicator needs help.  It broke within a couple of uses, I replaced it with another pump, which works fine</li>
    <li> Similar to a product I was already using.  I may or may not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love this serum.  I really believe I see a significant improvement in my skin since I have been using it (I&#x27;m halfway through my second bottle). Worth the expense to me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a few weeks and therefore, not sure how effective it is.&lt;br /&gt;This product absorbs quickly and works well before applying my moisturizer and CC cream.&lt;br /&gt;When I combine it with a Vitamin C powder and they kind of combat each other, with pilling.</li>
    <li> This product has a nice texture and smell. It feels hydrating on the skin when you put it on. After using it for four days, I&#x27;ve definitely noticed reduced wrinkles and fine lines. The skin around my cheeks still feel a little dry, but has improved. Over time, I definitely notice my skin looks better and firmer when I use this everyday. I use every evening under moisturizer and many times during the day too.</li>
    <li> Works great, but if your skin tends to be dry, this may intensify that. It does what it says and works well.</li>
    <li> Would love to order more</li>
    <li> this is a wonderful product. After using olay for many years, I can &#x27;t believe the difference.</li>
    <li> Started using this about six months ago.  I&#x27;m 56 years old, I no longer have any lines on my face.  I have vowed to never use Botox or anything surgical on my face.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a week and a half. It is a very thin product, goes one well and I can feel a tightness as it dries on my skin. I think t is to early to tell if it going to work 100%. It has not caused any breakouts nor has it caused an reactions even with makeup over it. I will keep using it and report back when more time has passed</li>
    <li> Too soon to provide a rating, so two star isn&#x27;t really a bad rating.  I&#x27;ve had no allergic reactions, which is good ;-)</li>
    <li> I had high hopes when I ordered this product, but thought maybe the reviews might be a little too good to be true. After having used the serum for only a few days, morning and night, I&#x27;m thrilled with the results. Smoother skin, healthier looking, not as dull - I&#x27;m so glad I took the chance. If you&#x27;re on the fence like I was, give it a try. As for me, I won&#x27;t be without this serum from now on!  (Received a trial of product)</li>
    <li> Works great! Really seeing and improvement in my skin with tightening of wrinkles!</li>
    <li> This HA serum is heaven sent! I can not believe how well this product works with my skin. It fully absorbs and seals in a hydration that is really remarkable for an HA serum. I have noticed that my skin feels more firm and my fine lines are barely noticeable. Worth the money &amp; I am a repeat customer!</li>
    <li> I was o.k.  Personally, I prefer using Episilk&#x27;s Pure HA, as it is a tad &#x27;thicker&#x27; (so to speak) and like the way it glides and absorbs into the skin.  This particular product was just o.k. for me but don&#x27;t thing I&#x27;ll buy again.  I&#x27;ll use up what I have though.</li>
    <li> This product has become part of my daily skin care routine. I started using this when I needed to take a break from my other moisturizers especially when they start making me break out. I have noticed this serum helps smooth out my dry patches and strangely enough helps with my acne! Occasionally I use it around the eye area and so far it works better than my other expensive eye creams.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. My skin was so dry and would become flaky even after applying moisturizer. This product is a MUST HAVE for peeling dry skin. I use it as a quick mask over any dry areas and they absolutely vanish within minutes. It&#x27;s like magic! Use it as a serum or a spot treatment in addition to any skincare routine. One of my all time must-have products!</li>
    <li> Not sure I&#x27;m seeing any results at all.  I&#x27;m 47 and have a few fine lines and areas I wanted to &#x27;firm up&#x27;.  I&#x27;ve used this religiously morning and evening since purchasing and don&#x27;t see any improvement in either of these areas.  Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I don&#x27;t find this sticky at all and my skin soaks it up like a sponge. It goes under my moisturizer day and night. I finally repurchased this in the full size and remembered why I loved it so much in the first place. I find that my skin is getting oilier as I get older and I&#x27;ve used this for the past couple of days and it help reduced the appearance of my greasy looking skin. This is now on my HG list and I won&#x27;t ever stop using it!</li>
    <li> Since using the HA serum by Vernal I have noticed that my skin feels tighter and appears younger. When I say that my skin feels tighter I do not mean that feeling you get sometimes when your skin is dried out. My skin feels firm, tight, and hydrated. I plan on reordering another bottle one I reach the half way point of my current one.</li>
    <li> It really seems to help! Especially during that time of month when the breakouts get out of control lol</li>
    <li> I used to use Meaningful Beauty, Cellceudicals by Garth Fisher, and many other products.  As a 40 year old male just starting to age and this line of products worked much better than anything I had tried before, the eye cream actually does get rid of the dark bags.  I noticed the biggest difference after I quit using these products and went back to Meaningful Beauty and I my face and complexion was no where near as good as when I was using the Vernal.  I&#x27;m hooked on these until I find something better.  You need to also get an exfoliating cleanser like the Skinmedica AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser to get rid of the dead skin.  This stuff rocks!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer; it&#x27;s not too greasy, it absorbs well. It also has a nice light fragrance. I have noticed some improvement, my fine lines are less defined. The texture is very light, it is not thick at all. Goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. I feel that it evens my skin tone slightly also, it&#x27;s noticeable to me, however I doubt colleagues &amp; friends would really notice. It does moisturize well.</li>
    <li> There are many HA serums on the market with a certain percentage all claiming to do the same thing. After a couple of weeks of using this moisturizer I noticed that fine lines overall are less visible. I also have extremely dry skin and most moisturizer just soaks in to my skin and a hour later my skin turns dry and irritated again, but this lasts all day for me. I well definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I can really feel and see a reduction of wrinkles with this product!</li>
    <li> As a guy, I don&#x27;t wear or even think about make up or skin conditioners.  But I accidently got introduced to these sorts of products while in Vegas, when one of the counter saleswomen applied it to just one of my eyes, and all of my whole family agreed there was a noticeable improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Searching around here on Amazon I found this product based on similarity to what I&#x27;d tried in Vegas.  This was far more affordable.  After a few days application, after my shower in the mornings and after washing my face in the evenings I started to see the lines around my eyes and forehead disappear.  I&#x27;m using this stuff sparingly.  Only 1 drop or less below the eyes and around the corner where all the &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; are, and another drop on my forehead.  Completely invisible and seems to work well when used daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed.  Will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Love the firming action.  Has a very slight smell that doesn&#x27;t linger. Goes on smooth and isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
    <li> I do love this product.  It has made such an improvement in the look of my skin and I do believe it has improved the wrinkles (laugh lines?).  Love the tightening effect.  I have extremely sensitive sun damaged skin and have no irritation.  I plan to buy it as long as I can afford it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now been using this product for a year.  I order it every two months.  I wish I could use it all over my body!</li>
    <li> I find when I use this serum, then go about my day I look like I have more crows feet around my eyes than normal.  I do not care for this product.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  I will write another review after 30 days use.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. Does what it promised. Tightens skin and gives it a smooth appearance. I already reordered it several times.</li>
    <li> Feels great, thank you</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you have dry skin. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and I am noticing some major changes - my skin is brighter, complexion looks healthier and it&#x27;s definitely doing great in the moisturizing department! I am definitely going to buy a full size bottle of it after I&#x27;m done with the sample. I love that it&#x27;s not too thick or sticky.</li>
    <li> dried my skin too much</li>
    <li> first it was great... now my face is adapting to it and its making me break out more. I don&#x27;t know because I was messing with it or what but I start to get black heads again so I popped them and now im breaking out again. The product however is very light weight and is somewhat evening out my skin tone.</li>
    <li> As I indicated on the day product, expected better results.</li>
    <li> I have been using the anti-aging Vernal line for several months. My skin tends to be dry but this moisturizer feels great. I love that it&#x27;s lightweight and absorbs quickly. Since I have been using this and the rest of the line, I have received several compliments on my skin and how great it looks. I had fine lines showing up around my Tline and could never seem to hydrate them enough. This does the trick for me and gives an overall firmness that I thought was lost to time.</li>
    <li> I really like it.  Can&#x27;t get going without it..</li>
    <li> Very nice product. I like it very much, it makes my skin smoothly</li>
    <li> Dries out my skin - cannot even use it with face cream.  Did not see any difference after two months of use.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 2 months and no difference. I waited to write this review until I could tell if any difference. In the morning when you put it on&lt;br /&gt;it seems like it is doing &amp;#34;something&amp;#34; but it is not doing anything at all. Actually I got couple of new wrinkles after I started it. So sorry to say this&lt;br /&gt;but just save your money, until THEY come out with something better!!!</li>
    <li> So here&#x27;s the deal: I am REALLY enjoying this stuff so far.  I have naturally oily skin, which gets oilier when not properly hydrated.  Since I began using the product, because I&#x27;m more &amp;#34;naturally&amp;#34; moisturized, I get oily less quickly throughout the day, and get far less oilier than I used to.  Additionally, though I&#x27;m a bit on the younger side, I already have some fine lines and deeper wrinkles developing around my eyes, along with some marionette lines down below.  Within just a few days, this has helped to &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; those a bit and my lines are FAR less noticeable than they were just a few days ago.  Just a FEW DAYS!  I honestly have become excited to wake up in the morning, simply to look in the mirror to see what changes have occurred under the eyes.  Additionally, I have some indented acne scarring that I&#x27;m pretty much stuck with for the rest of my life.  Because of the natural plumping effect of the HA in this product, those have also diminished somewhat.  I&#x27;m not going to tell you they&#x27;re down significantly or have almost disappeared, but it&#x27;s definitely enough that I notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why only four stars?  Unfortunately, I&#x27;m a firm believer in truth-in-advertising.  The manufacturer/seller doesn&#x27;t list the entirety of their ingredients on their site, but the Amazon listing clearly states that the product contains retinol.  Imagine my disappoint upon receiving the product only to discover the ingredients include retinyl palmitate but NO retinol.  Yeah, it&#x27;s close...and they&#x27;re both forms of vitamin A...but close doesn&#x27;t cut it.  It&#x27;s NOT the same.  Shame on the manufacturer/distributor for a) not disclosing all ingredients, and b) advertising and claiming something that doesn&#x27;t exist (even worse if the manufacturer simply isn&#x27;t aware there&#x27;s a difference).</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Makes my face feel firm.  I am 50 and since I started using this, people have been saying how good I look.  I think it is this serum that is working for me!  I like the way my skin looks too!</li>
    <li> this is a hoax... not only does it not work, but you are charge restocking charge of 44.00 when you cancel and you cant talk to a person to contest.  DONT BUY IT......,</li>
    <li> its ok but im sure there are over the counter products that work just as well costing less money not sure if im going to purchase again</li>
    <li> Great product.  I was not sure whether I should try something new again as I have spent quite some time searching for the one that will have the result I&#x27;m looking for.  I was surprised.  I have been using this product for a week and I have seen a firmer looking skin.  Cannot wait to use tonight and see what is gonna happen tomorrow!</li>
    <li> Product did keep the facial area well hydrated.  Well worth the price when compared to other products at a higher price point.</li>
    <li> Did not do what it claimed. still look at wrinkles everyday. I&#x27;m sorry I couldn&#x27;t give you a better review.</li>
    <li> I love the Vernal product that I order- &amp;#34;Best Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  I apply it after my toner.  It makes my skin feel fresh and firm.</li>
    <li> Best wrinkle serum I have ever used. It works!! I have been using it for 6 months and my skin is much firmer and smoother.</li>
    <li> Only been using it for a week but like the changes.  I was using StriVectin prior to this and I like the results better with Vernal.  Cost is less also.</li>
    <li> ** received for review and inspection purposes **  Great stuff. No complaints. My skin glows a bit more and feels smoother and more supple. This company makes some great products.</li>
    <li> Arrived sooner than expected.  Exceptional results!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but am now a fan. It makes my skin soft and not so dull looking which is a problem I&#x27;ve been battling for a while. I&#x27;m not exposed to much sun, so my face looked pale and dull not matter how much exfoliating and moisturizers I used. Now tho, it looks healthier. Great serum, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I really love using this serum! I&#x27;ve tried using my other serums, and they worked well, but this is one is amazing! It improves my skin texture and hydration giving me a more firmer smoother look and some of the puffiness around  my eyes goes away immediately. Immediate results! Worth the money. A little goes a very long way too.</li>
    <li> I bought this product not having high expectations, given the hundreds of dollars i have spent between, anti-aging serums, lotions, creams and the like. However, this product simply blew me away. The second I put it on my face feels like silk.It has improved the texture of my skin. I had started softening in the around me cheek area and it really has improved the look and feel of the skin. I will purchase this product again when I run out. You do not need to moisturize over it.</li>
    <li> I generally loathe serums for two reasons: 1) They are insultingly overpriced. 2) They smell awful. A friend of mine recommended this product and I&#x27;m so happy to have found it. I use it in the morning under my moisturizer and my skin looks and feels better for it. I like that it immediately softens and firms, and long term my skin looks more radiant and I&#x27;ve noticed a lessening of fine lines and wrinkles. Terrific product. \\&quot;</li>
    <li> Initially, it felt like a face mask,  and I didn&#x27;t think it was a good product at all.  Kept it in my cosmetic drawer for a week,  and decided to give it another try.  Just as the directions indicate, you need to work it into your skin until it feels soft and dewy.  So far so good, no complaints from the second try.</li>
    <li> I got this product as a sample and from my first impression it is light weight, light fragrance, serum. Nicely packaged. Overall I am very happy with it. I wait until the product is fully absorbed before applying moisturizer, etc on top of it, so I am able to feel the tightening effect. After a full use which for me was about 32 days my skin now looks and feels years younger!</li>
    <li> It spreads easily and dries quickly with a nice tight and firm feeling to the face and neck without over working it.  Make-up can be applied minutes after application. I just recently started using this product, but so far I am please with it&#x27;s overall performance.  One note of caution, if you have dry to very dry skin you may not  want to use it on a daily bases,  but since I have normal to oil skin it works wonderfully without over drying or tighting.  I do intend on continuing to use it and I am planning on  reordering.  Best of Luck.</li>
    <li> I definitely works for tightening the skin and look forward to&lt;br /&gt;continual use.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this product. It helps the skin on my face stay soft yet firm under my make-up. I will be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> Sheesh, who really knows if products like this actually work.  But, I can tell you that as soon as you apply this product, you feel your skin tingle and tighten.  And, with all these proven ingredients for skin care, it surely helps over time.  It sure seems like it works to me.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Not very pleased with this product. When I received the serum the ingredients label is not on it and does not even tell you the percentage of Hyaluronic Acid it has in it.  It did nothing for my skin and I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
    <li> Have to try it for your self,  I love this stuff</li>
    <li> Just started to use this three days ago.  I was a little nervous to try a product line that I never heard off, but I am glad I did.  Very smooth on and I feel my skin is a tad bit brighter.  No breakouts, but will keep monitoring.  I am using this with Obagi Hydrate, skin was a little dry after some cold temps and now is back to normal.</li>
    <li> My skin feels tighter the moment  I apply this serum . Have never found any product that I like as well as Vernal skin care products</li>
    <li> I dont think any of these products really work.  Im sticking with coconut oil.</li>
    <li> This serum is fantastic. It works so fast. It&#x27;s been a week of me using night and day and I can visually see a difference. It&#x27;s so light weight and doesn&#x27;t make me feel oily. I was nervous about getting it because it&#x27;s so expensive but honesty worth ever penny. My face looked so plump and so bright the first morning and ever since. A lot goes a long way.They are pricey but I have NEVER seen results so quickly! Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> LOVE!!!!! Great product thank you!!!</li>
    <li> This light weight serum has a pleasing consistency and nice subtle fragrance. It is easy to layer under moisturizer and other products you might use. Skin feels softer immediately and fine lines appear to have diminished within just two weeks.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product once a day for two weeks and have not seen any results or change in my skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service and product.</li>
    <li> it worked real good thank you.</li>
    <li> Thanks god ... !!! Finally  I found it...  love it ..!!</li>
    <li> Very good. This serum works better than any I have used before. This is my second container.  I would never reorder if it wasn&#x27;t an excellent product.</li>
    <li> Sorry! this product does not work for my tipe of skin, I tried 3 times and makes my face look doll.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I can see they are very good beauty helpers . I was expecting more from &amp;#34;Repair care eye gel &amp;#34; but still good.</li>
    <li> Been quite a few weeks don&#x27;t see any changes in my fine lines I&#x27;m in my 20s</li>
    <li> I ordered the serum and the moisturizer &amp; began using both around March 20.  It has been just a little over a month, so I can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s making a difference or not.  I do want to mention that if you order the 2 products, it&#x27;s best to use 1 1/2 pumps of each or you will run out of one before the other is gone.  Previous comments said that the moisturizer wouldn&#x27;t pump as it was too thick.  I had to turn the first moisturizer container upside down and smack it on the palm of my hand multiple times to get it to come out.  The order I just received pumps much easier.  I am 68 &amp; have quite a few deep wrinkles, so I&#x27;m hoping that this product may slow the appearance of new ones!</li>
    <li> LOVING THIS PRODUCT - I use it before I go to bed every night and my skin looks and feels great when I wake up and I also notice my wrinkles have improved ~  I don&#x27;t have too much as I&#x27;m 39 but fine lines/wrinkles are definitely there and this product is great!</li>
    <li> Have as a gift &amp; she loved them</li>
    <li> THIS ITEM WAS DELIVERED ON TIME AND AS ADVERTISED. I ACTUALLY HAVE NOT SEN ANY DIFFERENCE IN MY SKIN. IT WAS A LOT OF MONEY FOR NOT MUCH DIFFEREENCE ON MY SKIN. I WON&#x27;T RENEW.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about this the first few days of use.  I had to use some more moisture over it on occasion.  But can certainly see some improvement in my face.  Brighter, lines less noticeable.  Will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> Did nothing to improve skin, felt a little tighter but soon went away. Would NOT buy again. Just because it costs more does not mean it works!</li>
    <li> The wrinkles around my forehead have improved using this product. A little goes a very long way. Perfect for moisturizing during the day. Makes your skin feel like silk and wrinkles are reduced! I&#x27;m 42 and can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff. I would recommend it to other individuals, as I am a person who has sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best used on clean skin and nighttime only</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd bottle and I love it. My pores are smaller, less wrinkles and no break outs. I recently noticed that by the end of the day my face is also not really oily anymore . Before I would have to touch up my make-up but not anymore.  I have even fallen asleep with my make-up on and the next morning my face is mostly dry. Will continue to use this as long as its available.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a little more than a month now.  I&#x27;m 53 yrs old with not that many wrinkles, but maybe it&#x27;s too late for me because it&#x27;s not working.  I have very oily T-zone.  I like that as soon as I put it on my forehead, my skin feels tighter.  The 3 lines on my forehead are still noticeable.  I was told by a nurse that this contains something that pulls moisture up on the face so makes it look like wrinkles go away a little bit.  I will continue to buy this because I like the tightness feeling on my face and upper chest.  And my face seems less oily.  Though I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a good thing since the oil is why I don&#x27;t have that many wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This trio of products has had a tremendous impact on my skin. I am a 68-year-old male. Vernal serum, moisturizer and eye treatment are probably the reason I have had such marked improvement. I recommend the trio. This really is significant improvement in skin health; both the appearance and touch. It even helps reduce the look of loose skin on front of the neck – no easy task. I&#x27;m not a product junkie, but I lucked onto this via Google because my skin just looked tired. I feel better and look better. Because the product is good, I am motivated to take better general care of my skin, too. All around, a five-star product.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. After an exhaustive (&amp; exhausting!) search for an anti-aging serum, I think I have found my hg! I tried a sample of this (3-4 uses) &amp; really liked the feel of it and the immediate impact it had on the expression lines by my mouth. I was hesitant to buy the full size b/c of the price, but splurged during a 20% off deal. Boy, am I glad I did b/c this has made an incredible difference in my skin - evening tone, smoothing texture &amp; visibly diminishing my fine lines &amp; wrinkles. I have since reordered &amp; am experiencing the same results! Love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work very well for me. It tightened a little.dissapointed.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product, on my third bottle and will continue to use the serum.</li>
    <li> Serum leaves a sticky film.  It&#x27;s not very rich, very much like aloe vera gel.  It&#x27;s not as rich as touted.  Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Works o.k. but you would probably have to use long term to see any real difference. I only used it a few months and could honestly not tell any difference than when using a cheaper store brand from my local drug store</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much change.</li>
    <li> great for the skin, I mix it with Botox Alternative:hyaluronic Acid,15% Matrixyl 3000, 20% Argireline,5 % Vitamin C,repair, Boost Collagen, 1oz Serum&lt;br /&gt;by PROTOXYN -X5, from amazon too,  both dry clean &amp; fast, no greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> Have used serum for about 2 weeks.  Slight improvement on a deep forehead wrinkle near my eyebrow and  on fine crow&amp;#34;s feet wrinkles.  No improvement yet on smile wrinkles.  I do feel a skin dryness upon application.  I use Skinlogics day cream and night cream and that takes care of the dryness immediately.  I am a 66yr old woman, who  smiles a lot, so I&#x27;m not expecting miracles.  Will continue uising Vernal Skincare and hope for more improvement by the time I use up the bottle.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see abit of difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> For me, it works! It has a silky texture and just a little goes a long way. It absorbs quickly and you can feel an almost instant firming so I especially like to use it during the day. I apply it twice a day on both my face and neck and over time, I think it has helped with my skin&#x27;s overall appearance.</li>
    <li> My skin is a combination, but my main concern was how dry and flaky my skin gets, especially after I have washed my face. I have only been using this product for about a week but I love it already! he gel texture absorbs in the way that it creates a shield that protects and nourishes your skin. It&#x27;s hydrating, but not greasy, so makeup goes on smoothly and looks better longer. I recommend this to anyone. Bye flaky dry skin!!</li>
    <li> Refreshing scent. Moisturizing, but does not cause breakout. I feel that my skins appears firmer and more radiant after 3 weeks of use</li>
    <li> I personally saw results as soon as 2 weeks! I am 58. In addition to wrinkles, sagging jowls and dull skin, I acquired Adult acne when I hit that time of the month! This serum addresses all of those issues. It is awesome, and it is it clearing up my skin. I have tried every skin care line around and this is definitely a superior product. This product works well because I don&#x27;t have any peeling that I get with similar serums and I&#x27;ve noticed results on the softness and the fine lines in my skin after about 2 weeks of use.</li>
    <li> This product really works.  I am 59 years old and dry skin has been a problem no matter what kind of moisturizer I use.  I have spent hundreds of dollars on many different products only to be disappointed.  I used the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and it is so silky.  It absorbs quickly and I only had to use a small amount of my moisturizer at night after this serum absorbed.  It really works fantastically well. I use it twice a day morning and night.  During the day I only use the serum before applying my makeup.  Not greasy, absorbs quickly, and really moisturizes well.  I rely on reviews myself for products I buy and want to tell others about my experience with this serum.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been so pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> It caused a terrible skin reaction.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t moist much for dry skin, but It works better combined with Vernal Anti Aging moisturizer cream. I have a dry skin, even combined with both products still not moist enough. but they do decreasing wrinkle though.</li>
    <li> Hve ordered twice...l love this stuff</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product did absolutely nothing for me. However, the vernal moisturizer is very good.</li>
    <li> My main area of concern was the area around my mouth.  I have noticeable vertical lines.  This product did nothing to decrease the appearance of these lines.  I will continue to use the prospect till finished...approximately 2 more weeks...thus a total of approx. 6wks...and see if it as made an difference.</li>
    <li> I have only had this product for a week, so it is too soon to tell of any long-term benefit. It does seem to tighten my skin when I put it on. However, as an informed consumer, I have spent some time investigating what are the best ingredients (sunscreens excluded) for anti-aging and collagen production, and I am impressed with the ingredients in this product, especially considering the price.</li>
    <li> I can see and feel the difference in my face.  It immediately feels tighter and silkier.  Apply first thing in morning and last at night.  Is fine under makeup.</li>
    <li> Product is very smooth. My faces feels very hydrated after I&#x27;ve used it.  Absorbs into face after application very well and can easily apply foundation on top of product</li>
    <li> The best facial I have ever used. I have found through the short time that I have been using the Venal facial products (I.e. repair eye gel,hyaluronic acid serum &amp; anti aging moisturizer) have had the most noticeable change in my skin. I am 68 yrs of age with dry skin and a chicken neck although wrinkles and lines are minimal except for lines on the upper lip. The moisturizers that I have used in the past did not retain any moisture, which I found rather disconcerting. Well, the Vernal Skincare - Best Hyaluronic  Acid Serum has definitely made a difference. I only use the products in the morning and when I awaken the next morning, my face is still moist. As I noted in my evaluation for the eye gel - one half of each eyebrow had thinned out to be almost not there for about 15 years, however after using the three aforementioned products for about 1-1/2 weeks, my eyebrows filling in. I cannot think of anything that has changed - my diet is the same and I do not take any medications. I highly recommend the Vernal product line.</li>
    <li> This.is.awesome! I have been searching for years for something that works like this product. I saw results in days. Will be buying more.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect a miracle, but had hoped for a difference another case of OVER SELL AND UNDER DELIVER this will be returned</li>
    <li> Use it everyday.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This serum is awesome! It&#x27;s light on my skin, but I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in my skin in just 2 weeks. My skin is more even and way less dry. I notice the biggest different when I apply at night and wake up the next morning. My skin has never felt softer or glowed more. I am happy and will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I thought that this was just another facial serum that got crazy hype, but having used it for 5 months, I can really say that it does make a difference. My pores are cleaner, smaller, and the redness on my face are almost non existent, and my skin is just way smoother. It also gives a bit of a healthy glow. A must have!</li>
    <li> I have been really sensitive to most lotions and moisturizers so I don&#x27;t use them (for the most part). But my skin was getting more and more sensitive and I&#x27;d heard dryness can increase re-activeness in your skin. I bought this serum. It&#x27;s light, hydrating, doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and absorbs really well. My skin feels so much softer and it&#x27;s visibly more even. I love it!</li>
    <li> This may be a great product, I don&#x27;t think it is right for me.  It feels sticky on my face and I don&#x27;t like the feel.  I always had to put another cream over this.  I did try to use it for at least a week, but I couldn&#x27;t get past the feeling.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Lightweight, non clogging, refreshing...pleased with how my skin looks.</li>
    <li> This gave me better results than the more expensive cream I was using</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no use applying moisturizer if it doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin. I have dry skin with patches of flaky skin on my chin and around my brows.A layer of this serum is a godsend for people like me because it draws moisture into the skin so that my other products can do their jobs I have been applying this product am and pm (before mousturizer) and the flaking has diminished. I&#x27;ve also noticed that my skin feels softer. My only complaint is with the pump on the bottle, which squirts the product out in a high arc, often missing my fingers. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> No miracles, but what does do miracles that comes in a bottle? I like this line...it does give a healthier glow and minimizes fine lines. It&#x27;s cheaper than many of the Dept Store creams, but just as good</li>
    <li> I am in my early 50&#x27;s and realizing my face is aging by the minute. I was looking for a skin care regimen that would make my lines disappear. I chose this product after seeing someone elses review. They claimed it helped improve their vertical lines above their lip. That is an area I also wanted to concentrate on. The serum makes your face feel tight after applying and I actually have to use more than I thought I would, however, I really like how the product makes my face feel after the application. I have even noticed a slight shine/brightness to my face after  week of use.</li>
    <li> Hydration is essential for all types of skin. I have tried many Hyaluronic products, and have settled on this as the best. The percentage of hyaluronic is highest and this is the best value. It does a great job at smoothing in the fine lines around the forehead and crease area. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This serum is wonderful!  I have been using this for approximately 3 weeks. The consistency looks like a gel, but when rubbed between the palms turns into a silky liquid.  It absorbs quickly into my skin and does not leave a sticky feeling.  My skin feels considerably more hydrated and my skin does look more supple and even.  I really like this serum and will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for couple of weeks now, havent seen any undesired effects on my skin. Leaves a smooth finish on the surface, enhances the youthfulness, feel and appearance of the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost all similar products of this kind and this stuff is the best. I don&#x27;t drink enough water, so my skin isn&#x27;t hydrated enough. this product helps me with that. This product is amazing! It really does what it claims. I&#x27;ve been using it ever since! I use this product on my cheeks because they get really dried out from using Proactiv. I this serum on in the morning and it keeps my cheeks hydrated all day. LOVE THIS!!!</li>
    <li> My skin has improved in only three days...smoother, clearer and softer.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product along with the Vernal Repair Care Eye Gel at the end of April, started using it in May - it is now the first week of August.&lt;br /&gt;I believe this is supposed to last about 4 to 6 weeks, and it&#x27;s lasted over 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;I just placed another order for both.&lt;br /&gt;The product lasted so long because I obviously did not use it according to the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in sales, I do a lot of commuting and traveling, so I forgot to put it on a few times.&lt;br /&gt;However, as a 49 year old male I am aware that age can become an issue in the public eye, and I am VERY satisfied with this product.&lt;br /&gt;When I use the face cream, I rub it on my cheeks, forehead and under my chin.&lt;br /&gt;(I have the Eye Care for that area)&lt;br /&gt;I can feel it tightening my skin after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some reviews here that state it \\&quot;feels like it drys the skin\\&quot; - I personally do not think that&#x27;s accurate.&lt;br /&gt;I can feel it tightening, especially the cheek area.&lt;br /&gt;Since I don&#x27;t wear make up, I can run my hand over my face and my skin does not feel &#x27;dry&#x27; at all, it feels tight and it&#x27;s smooth to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m wondering if some people are confusing the tightening with &#x27;dryness?&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;When I use the product per the directions, it makes me look younger.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how to explain it, but it seems like I have a certain &#x27;glow&#x27; that I didn&#x27;t have before.&lt;br /&gt;This product is much less expensive than some I&#x27;ve used in the past, no unpleasant odor and it does its job.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something better than a department store product but don&#x27;t want to spend the money for some premium face creams THIS IS THE WAY TO GO.&lt;br /&gt;Read my review for the eye care, then place your order for both of these.&lt;br /&gt;I will use my next order the way it&#x27;s supposed to be used and write an update.&lt;br /&gt;So far...VERY SATISFIED.</li>
    <li> okay, but not as good as others!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> In all honesty i havent tried it yet... However is packaged nicely, sleek looking bottle, very good size for $. Excited to use! Also amaZing customer service!</li>
    <li> I heard terrific things about hyaluronic acid.  I put this on my face after washing and before moisturizing.  I am fortunate to have healthy skin at my age, and it seems like this is helping to maintain it.</li>
    <li> This is the most effective product I&#x27;ve tried so far to diminish the bags under my eyes.  I am 69 and use it before my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Due to the fact that I am no spring chicken, I am not looking for a miracle cure for all my lines, but this seems to have made a dent in them. I will order this again when I need to. I use it with another of their cream and between the two they work pretty well. They are not as expensive as others and like most of us out there, we can&#x27;t afford 150.00 creams.</li>
    <li> I am really pleased with how this makes my skin look. I been using this product for less than a month on a daily basis. I&#x27;m pleased with the visible changes on my skin. The serum keeps my skin hydrated all day and goes well with other products. I&#x27;ve seen some fine lines around my forehead become less visible now and my skin looks more plump. Good product, It is refreshing to buy a product that actually does what they say it will do. It is also very affordable.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time. I&#x27;ve been using it everyday and I guess I can see some change but not as defined as what others have experienced. So either it doesn&#x27;t work or I got the stale batch.</li>
    <li> Words cannot describe how great this stuff is. It really works on my fussy, sensitive skin that has a tendency to break out. My pores appear smaller, my breakouts have diminished and my skin just glows. It tends to go by fast, but paired with moisturizer this is the bomb!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for 2 weeks now and i haven&#x27;t noticed a significant change in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I feel very dry and need more moisture.</li>
    <li> I have been using this about three months along with the face lotion and the exfoliant (which I use once a week).  I went home for the holidays and my family asked if I had gotten botox.  The lines around my mouth and eyes have greatly been reduced as well as the texture of my skin, which was previously a little dull.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference in &amp;#34;age, sun&amp;#34; spots and just ordered their spot reducer so we&#x27;ll see.  I have tried everything under the sun from Ponds to La Mer and this has worked the best.  My skin is sensitive to breakouts, which I haven&#x27;t had a problem with either.</li>
    <li> Goes on and soaks right into my skin.  No slimy residue.  My skin looks bright and smooth.  I live in a humid climate and need a light-weight moisturizer.  This is it for me!</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot.</li>
    <li> I was shocked how well this works and it feels great. I put it on under my eyes and it&#x27;s a noticeable improvement.</li>
    <li> Nice and easy packing. Stuff absorbs well.</li>
    <li> After use for a month I started getting wrinkled skin on my neck where there were no wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Ive only been using this for about 4-5 days and so far I love it!. If you have oily skin like me, this is great for you!. So far my skin looks brighter and more firmer. POres are gone and like I said, i put it on in the morning and my skin stays fhresh all day ! not oily at all. I will deff keep buying it!!!! love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Normally, I&#x27;m very weary of trying new products since from time to time I tend to get monthly breakouts, so that&#x27;s always a big concern. I want to make sure that my moisturizer is not going to exacerbate the issue. So, I reluctantly tried to this moisturizer thinking it may be too heavy and cause more oiliness. I was wrong!! It was an amazing moisturizer. I feel like my skin finally feels balanced after many years of possibly using moisturizer that was too lightweight for me. I realized that maybe a good intensive moisturizer was exactly what I had needed. So, my advice would be to give it a try. I have been using this for about a month and I notice such a difference! Fine lines gone, uneven coloring gone...my skin is healthy and soft.</li>
    <li> Having just turned 40 I&#x27;ve suddenly noticed that around my face I have some extreme dryness and early wrinkles starting - eek! No amount of moisturizer seemed to be helping so I did some research and found this cream from Vernal. This is extremely emollient and a little goes a long way. But the reason it works so well for me is because it doesn&#x27;t settle into my lines, it really does a lot to moisturize and by ingredient, it&#x27;s loaded with good for me antioxidants. Only if you need some significant moisture and you can tolerate a very emollient formula. For me this is exactly right for this delicate skin on my face.</li>
    <li> Really very good serum, but have found others as good and cheaper.  They all contain nearly the same ingredients and I loved this one, but there are so many good ones on the market and I didn&#x27;t notice any great advantages over others, but whatever serum I use has helped my skin tremendously!</li>
    <li> I have bought all of the really expensive products. This isn&#x27;t, but really works well.</li>
    <li> Light weight, but really hydrating. I love the way my make up looks when applied over this serum. It absorbs very quickly and I wake up with radiant and fresh skin. I do feel a difference (way softer, smoother face) and this one dry/flaky spot on my cheek isn&#x27;t flaky and dry any more. I wish they made a body moisturizer! I highly recommend this product for anyone with dry skin like mine.</li>
    <li> Caused pimples and breakouts. It caused wrinkles to look worse. Pure gimmick.</li>
    <li> Awesome serum.  Causes no breakouts and absorbs quickly and completely.</li>
    <li> I combine this with Vit C as a moisturizer and it works well as a skin tightener on its own.</li>
    <li> Over the last 3 years I have tried a number of skin care lines. I am in my 50&#x27;s and have a lot of sun damage from overexposure when I was younger. This serum has worked best for me. It softens fine lines, decreases pore size, and overall seems to brighten my skin without feeling greasy like some other products.I have never found any other product able to handle all that it promises without being harsh on my extremely sensitive skin. The results have been skin changing...which equals life changing. I cannot recommend this Vernal serum enough.</li>
    <li> AFTER A WEEK OF USAGE, NOTICED SMOOTHER SKIN</li>
    <li> I really do like this.  I have purchaced twice now.  Firms skin and tightens.....I do see a difference.  There is enough in bottle to last a month using twice a day...... or a little more.  I say give it a try.</li>
    <li> As soon as I put it on my face I felt and saw difference. Skin gets very smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Just started using this week. Light serum that goes on easy. You can feel it tighten as it absorbes. For my fair skin I need additional moisturizer after it soaks in. Even so, it makes my skin glow and feels firm and soft. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Love the results I have gotten! I&#x27;m 52 years old and my skin has never looked better.  I&#x27;ve been using this for over 4 months now and clearly see diminishing of fine lines.  I highly recommend the highly the Age-Defying Microdermabrasion Exfoliant and Anti-Aging Moisturizer...great combination.</li>
    <li> Was a bit skeptical when I bought it, but saw results right away.  Seems to tighten and tone the areas quickly.  It says to use it twice daily, but sometimes I only use it once in the morning and the results are great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for anti-aging and firming serums. After a lot of searching, this product ended up being my holy grail. I started with a free sample and fell in love; I&#x27;m now on my third bottle. Over time, I definitely notice my skin looks better and firmer when I use this everyday. I use every evening under moisturizer and many times during the day too.</li>
    <li> I love all Vernal Skincare products.  I see an Esthetician and I buy these products over everything she recommends, because I believe in them that much.  The Hyaluronic Acid Serum has become my favorite.  I use it every morning before applying my makeup.  Just give it a minute to absorb.  It plumps my skin and gives it a soft lift and beautiful texture.  I have been a customer for over a year and will continue to be.  I am almost 48 years old and I get carded all the time.....</li>
    <li> Great product.  This was the  second bottle.</li>
    <li> I have been using this going on 2 months and I have not noticed anything at all, i&#x27;m disappointed. They claim you will see tightness in your skin shortly after you begin to use it and unfortunately that&#x27;s not the case, I will try it for a while longer to see but do not be fooled by the advertisement as I was.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> My skin looks and feels noticeably younger after using this product for the last 8 months.  I am 60 years old so this means a lot!  I took a selfie and many of my friends remarked on how great I looked!  My skin is softer, more firm and wrinkles are far less pronounced.  Thanks for the best skin care product I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> I really like this product, I thin my skin looks better after only 2 weeks use/  Am I crazy?</li>
    <li> Great value. Very fast service.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best hyaluronic acid I have used!  My skin has a glow, wrinkles are greatly diminished, and overall tone is better.  This is my new &amp;#34;favorite&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> love it the best ever and it really works</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  Great product.  I use it everyday!</li>
    <li> Patches of dry skin on and around my nose appeared after using it for a few weeks. Additionally, something is causing my cheeks to break out in a stinging red rash. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> For the price, not a bad product</li>
    <li> Feels so good going on and gives me a glowing complexion.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks.  I&#x27;ve seen some improvement in my skin.  It feels smoother and hopefully after using for a while will make my pores smaller.  I would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I just began using this product not too long ago.  Not sure whether i am seeing the results but i&#x27;m quite satisfied with this product. It is not greasy/ oily and absorbs into skin rather well.</li>
    <li> I received the package on time..the only thing I was disappointed about was the pump on the bottle, when I opened it there was some leakage on the lid and pump area...other than that everything was fine. I used this for about a week and notice a little tighten to the face area. It kinda made my face feel dry during the day so I only use at night before bed..I would recommend this</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Tightens skin and looks smoother already after a week!</li>
    <li> got this cheap for review love it leaves my skin feeling better</li>
    <li> I love this stuff....it actually works...it tones and tightens...I am happy with the results I tried the pure hyaluronic acid and I prefer this blend...enjoy!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin smooth and soft</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a week and so far I just love it! I will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> This really works.  The first aging serum that actually does what is promised.  Recommend to anyone who likes to look a little younger.  Money well spent.</li>
    <li> I am looking forward to continued use of this product as I can already notice a difference in my skin. I see diminished pore size and softening of fine lines and wrinkles. I can actually see a difference after using this product for one week. The lines in my forehead are a lot less noticeable.</li>
    <li> Saw absolutely no difference other than it makes my face very dry. Into the trash</li>
    <li> I bought this product after hearing great things about Hyaluronic Acid. After some research, this product seemed like the best choice for me. And best of all, I did see results! My skin feels and looks more hydrated than ever before.</li>
    <li> Did nothing but caused my skin to break out which is odd considering I found it to be extremely drying to my skin. I think the rave reviews are written by the company itself.</li>
    <li> This does exactly what it claims and it lasts a long time so the cost evens out.  I use it every night and I really like how it makes my skin look in the morning.  I will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying this product for a few days and I am liking it. Simple to use and my skin feels better. My mother-in-law even said I look rested.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price.</li>
    <li> Another winner  and yes if u don&#x27;t use a moisturizer over this it will be drying ~ so far I  have see results in two days no kidding! Again I will state I have high priced treatments that have not delivered results this fast I plan on buying again.</li>
    <li> I just purchased my third bottle and will continue to use this as my moisturizer. I am 69 and after years of sun worshipping and bad genes I don&#x27;t expect miracles. I have spent from a few dollars to hundreds of dollars on skin cream and for me this works best. I feel better about what I am seeing in the morning😊</li>
    <li> At 68 years old, I have the expected skin &amp;#34;issues&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;ve always taken good care of my skin, following the day and night-time cleansing and moisturizing rituals.  BUT - too much summer sun and general &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; have taken their toll.  I&#x27;ve used several serums and the Vernal Hyaluronic Acid is THE BEST.  I noticed a difference right off the bat.  Firmer, smoother, softer skin.  Wrinkles reduced.  I&#x27;ll definitely continue using the serum and try the other Vernal Skincare products.</li>
    <li> The serum worked really well. It&#x27;s light and not greasy. I saw the results and love how my appearance looks. More refreshed and younger looking.</li>
    <li> Whenever I order I have expectations of what the product should and should not do. This product does everything and some! I am used to using other HA serums where I have to heavily moisturize after use. That is not the case with this product! I do use their moisturizer after applying the serum but the smallest drop. The HA serum has a great tightening effect while not drying out my skin. My skin looks and feels younger by the day!</li>
    <li> ** received for review and inspection purposes **  This is good stuff. You can&#x27;t beat the price and quality.</li>
    <li> I will give it a five because in a short time I am seeing a change in the toning and firming of my skin. I have sensitive skin and did not have irritation, redness or itching. Good product</li>
