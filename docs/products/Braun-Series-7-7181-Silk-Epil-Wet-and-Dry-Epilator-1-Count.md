<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I rebought this recently after using it for years. The battery lasts forever and it&#x27;s great for wet or dry use. I love it. It works so well.</li>
    <li> Great product, absolutely satisfied with it&#x27;s performance. Also packaging and product delivery time very satisfactory!</li>
    <li> Much more gentle than others I have owned.</li>
    <li> I love it... If you are worried about the pain. Its ok. You get used to it.</li>
    <li> My wife tested this product and found that it was easy to use and worked really well. When the product first arrived it made her wonder if I was trying to tell her something, but no just interested to see how the product worked.  She found the instructions and the use to be very straightforward and the results after a few weeks have been stunning.  Her legs are smooth, stubble free and did not redden after using the epilator.  She did comment that it pulled at times and was slightly uncomfortable as she used it the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall recommended, not by me but by my better half.</li>
    <li> I had not used an epilator before trying this product.  However, I have done plenty of waxing, and also have had laser hair removal, so believe me, I am no stranger to pain when it comes to body hair.  I suppose I thought, having gone through those other experiences, that the epilator would be no different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference between the epilator and waxing:&lt;br /&gt;Waxing removes the hair in entire sections, in one fell swoop, so you can brace yourself with each section, go to your happy place, and then it&#x27;s over.  The epilator is used slowly and methodically, and doesn&#x27;t stop, and you have to think about it every inch of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference between the epilator and laser hair removal:&lt;br /&gt;Someone else administers the laser, so again, you can brace yourself and think about something else until it&#x27;s over.  Plus, the laser is moved around rapidly, so the pain moves around, not isolated to one small area.  The epilator is in one area, moving slowly, drawing too much focus, and caused me to repeatedly pull away in a knee-jerk reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for my actual experiences...&lt;br /&gt;First off, this thing scared me right out of the box - the noise it makes when it starts is low and warms up to a high whir.  But hey, I thought, don&#x27;t judge it by the sound - give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, I did.  Actually, I have given this product quite a few tries over the last 2 months, because I wanted to be sure I didn&#x27;t give my opinion based on a one-time attempt.  I have tried using it both wet and dry, as well as on my lower legs, upper legs, lower tummy, bikini, and the tops of my feet &amp; big toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not notice much difference in pain or ease of hair removal when using this wet or dry.  The only upside I found to using it dry is that I could see the fine, blond hair on my upper legs much better, as opposed to when it is wet and those hairs become practically invisible.  This meant that I was able to tell if I got all the hair, or needed to go over it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- My upper legs were much more successfully done than the lower.  I didn&#x27;t notice nearly as much pain, and the results lasted for a good while.  I did get a lot of red bumps the first time, but they only lasted for about 12 hours.  The occurence of bumps has also gradually diminished with each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- My lower legs were just too darn painful to go very far.  I tried, I really did.  I don&#x27;t have a high threshold for pain - I have no desire to get a tattoo or piercings for that reason alone.  I&#x27;d rather shave every day than have to endure what I felt when I tried epilating anywhere from my ankles to my knees!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- My lower tummy area and the tops of my feet &amp; toes were relatively pain free.  I&#x27;m not sure if that is due to the fact that I have waxed those areas for more than 15 years, and the lack of pain is possibly due to the hairs growing back finer each time after waxing already.  The red bumps I ended up with on my tummy lasted for 4 days - I was not happy about this, so I haven&#x27;t done that area again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- My bikini area was almost a repeat of my lower legs.  My saving grace was that this is one of the areas where I&#x27;ve had laser hair removal done, and most of the hair is already gone.  I have a few stragglers that continue to grow in that area, so I still have to do something about them.  Those suckers hurt a lot to epilate (I still think I&#x27;d rather have it waxed!) but it was bearable because it is such a small section.  However, I noticed I had more breakage in this area, possibly due to my own hesitancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I also tried using this to remove the hair on my chin and upper lip.  I have fine blond hair in these places, but it has started growing longer since I hit 30, so I&#x27;ve been waxing it.  I did not use the special attachment for the face, and I felt the results were acceptable.  When I pull my lips in between my teeth, it made these areas taut,which made epilating easy and quick.  I did not get the usual red bumps that I normally get from waxing these areas, either, which I appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;--------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life of this product has been very good so far, lasting through 4-5 sessions of treating my upper legs and other small areas.  I like that the little low battery light blinks for a while before the battery is going to die, signaling that I have limited time left, instead of the product just dying without warning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference with the little light that is supposed to help with visibility.  I have a fairly strong astigmatism, so showering without my glasses means I don&#x27;t see very clearly anyway.  Light or no light, I can&#x27;t clearly see what&#x27;s going on in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to continue to use this for the areas that didn&#x27;t hurt much, but I am going to stick with shaving for those lower legs for sure.  My personal pain tolerance can&#x27;t handle any more than that.which made epilating easy and quick.

    <li> Ṱℏαᾔк УỚυ - मेत्ता from FelixLopez.org.</li>
    <li> Wife likes it, that&#x27;s all that matters. She had an older model and wanted a new one, a Braun, specifically. So I got it and she loves it. I got some pee pee hairs I&#x27;d like to pluck slso, but so far I&#x27;m too chicken. Someday though...</li>
    <li> Liked it but it broke in only 4 months:(</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first epilator. It&#x27;s nice to be able to use it in the shower. It definitely hurts to use at first, but I got used to it after a couple uses. It looks great when it picks all the hairs, but sometimes it doesn&#x27;t snag all. I use exclusively on my armpits. I think it would be too painful and take too long to use on my legs. Requires frequent cleaning to keep it working optimally.</li>
    <li> My 30-yr old Epilady finally died and I hate the stubbles from shaving my legs. Hoping this Braun Silk Epil would be comparable but so far it&#x27;s not. Perhaps I&#x27;m spoiled or not using it correctly, but I find many hairs still on my legs and wind up tweezing when &amp;#34;I&#x27;m done&amp;#34; with the Braun. Oh well, I&#x27;ll update if needed.</li>
    <li> Pretty painful but otherwise a good product. Does the job.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the first Braun epilator that my wife has used, but it is the best.  It has the great solid construction that you expect from Braun (yes, already dropped once, still works fine).  It also does what it says it will do with regards to hair removal, although it hurts just as much as any other.  The addition of rechargeable wet/dry use, however, is a wonderful enhancement.  Using it in the shower is not only cleaner for the bathroom floor, but does seem to work better and with less pain.  It charges up quickly, although out of old habit, I did charge it 24 hours before using it the first time.  The charge has held for two uses already without a recharge.  Also, the controls are completely intuitive (she used it without looking at the instructions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, durable, functional, and easy to use.  Simply the best on the market.</li>
    <li> Received my Braun Silk-Epil 7 Wet and Dry a day earlier than scheduled (always good) and tried it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually wax, but in the past couple of months had to shave my legs and armpits. And it sucked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SE works wonderfully, fast, powerful and take out every single hair. Even when I just shaved the day before. I&#x27;m smooth again. And I love that it can be used on wet skin, too. Helps with the sting (that normally fades after the first few seconds of use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect!</li>
    <li> It hurts so much! I was looking for an alternative to shaving that would last longer, and I read about epilators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The machine fulfills its function, but the pain is unbearable. Worse than waxing. It&#x27;s been sitting in the box for months.</li>
    <li> The Braun SE7181 Silk-Epil Wet and Dry Epilator is as good of an epilator as you can get. It is easy to use and has an ergonomic grip making it comfortable to hold for the useage session. It has a built in light that is stunningly brilliant, and the battery life is excellent. This is not a picky epilator at all, it will handle even the smallest of hairs, hair so short other brands would miss them altogether. While there is a discomfort factor when using the device, until you become accustomed to it, that is a problem with the person using it, not the device itself, so if you couldn&#x27;t handle eplilating on another brand, this one isn&#x27;t going to be some pain-free miracle device; it&#x27;s going to bother you just as much. For those that can handle the initial discomort of epilating, this is the unit to go with, hands down. It is well built, and the fact that it is a Braun product is reassuring that it will provide many years of trouble-free service. Even though you really can&#x27;t see it in the photos, the unit has a sort of sparkly finish that adds a little eye-candy to the epilator.</li>
    <li> It takes a long time to get the same result as a razor would and you never get totally smooth.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product.  First time I&#x27;ve used an epilator, and while the pain is pretty much what you&#x27;d expect, the results are great.  It works on everything from very fine hairs to the really stubborn ones.  I&#x27;ve noticed that the charger makes an odd buzzing noise after a while, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be having any adverse effects.</li>
    <li> This shaver is very nice. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. It functions well. I would recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> This is not my first Epilator.  My first one was one of the Epilady \\&quot;coil\\&quot; ones when it was first introduced.  That one was touted as painless and yowsers, it made me switch right back to razors.  A little over 6 months ago, I got my hands on an Emjoi Optima (the yellow one) and while it hurt, it didn&#x27;t hurt as much as the original Epilady and well, it did an ok job.  Since trying the Silk Epil 5, I have retired my yellow Optima and I&#x27;m considering disposing off it completely. Now I am trying the Silk-Epil 7181 which offers Wet-Dry!  Which means I can take it in the shower and it&#x27;s cordless once charged, so I can take it anywhere... (but probably won&#x27;t because I like to confine hair removal activities to the bathroom, but it&#x27;s nice to have the option!)....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this review, I&#x27;ll share my opinion on the biggest difference between the Silk-Epil 7181 and the other epilators I have tried.  This one can get wet.  So I took it in the shower.  I imagined that the addition of warm water would allow the follicles to open up and the Silk Epil would gently pluck each hair out.  Ok.  I&#x27;m not delusional- I didn&#x27;t think it was going to be an extremely gentle and painless/discomfort-free plucking, but I did think the warm water and even just the atmosphere would make it an easier and more pleasant experience.  And it did.  Kind of.  The discomfort was less than on dry land.  I&#x27;d say the discomfort was around 1/2 of the discomfort I felt when using a similar device (the Braun Silk Epil 5) on dry skin/dry hair, while standing on a dry surface.  It still took quite awhile, but I&#x27;d say it took less time than dry.  And then I got out of the shower, toweled off, and went about my life.  A couple of hours later and I was standing on my lanai wearing shorts and I looked down at my legs in the sunlight and was horrified.  I had somewhat of a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow scenario on my legs!  I had stubble and it wasn&#x27;t even 5 o&#x27;clock.  I&#x27;m used to longer term hair-less legs from using an epilator of any sort and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m willing to deal with the discomfort.  So what happened?  It seems to me that when wet, and this could be a \\&quot;my experience, go have your own and it might be different\\&quot; sort of a thing, but I think that it tugged on the hair and sliced, but more like a really painful electric razor and it broke the hairs apart instead of pulling them all of the way out.  At least that is what looked like happened, and that also makes sense as far as the discomfort level- they were still being pulled but not pulled out.  Of course, YMMV.  I&#x27;d still like this as a dry epilator, and intend to continue using it as such.  It is nice not having the cord in the way....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I liked about the Silk-Epil 7181- which are the same things that I liked about the Silk Epil 5.&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Silk Epil 7181 Epilator has 2 ridged rollers on both sides (the long way) of the tweezers.  The Optima only had one, in the middle.  The rollers are sometimes called a \\&quot;massaging\\&quot; action.  My experience is that with the Braun you get one massage, hair ripping out, another massage... You don&#x27;t actually feel any \\&quot;massaging\\&quot; but it kind of distracts your nerves for just a moment so the pain isn&#x27;t as much as something without a massaging roller or one in the middle which reads more like \\&quot;pain massage pain\\&quot;....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen the light!  The Braun Silk Epil 7181 has a handy dandy little led light build right into it.  This really illuminates the skin well, so you can see every hair and you can run &#x27;em down until you are nice and smooth.  My bathroom doesn&#x27;t have the best lighting, and I had to go more by feel with my Optima, which usually meant (after holding the motorized contraption in my hand for a long time) I was missing large swaths of hair.  So the light is definitely a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other positive I found, about this particular hair removal device when I used it \\&quot;dry\\&quot;, and this may just be a me-only thing, so your mileage may indeed vary.I have been on treatments for RA for a long time, and since tapering down (partially) my prednisone, my skin marks and scars in a lovely deep shade of purple that doesn&#x27;t fade.  A cut while shaving results in a little purple line.  My other epilator left little purple dots/bruising (my RA treatment makes me bleed easily).  This one left two legs that were so smooth, and after a good night&#x27;s sleep, they weren&#x27;t irritated or spotty (except for previous marks- no new ones!  and I wore shorts for the first time in ages...  (of course, when I used it \\&quot;wet\\&quot; and in the shower, I put on shorts and ran back inside, somewhat horrified at my beastly legs that should have been smooth and sexy after that much time and effort)....I have been on treatments for RA for a long time, and since tapering down (partially) my prednisone, my skin marks and scars in a lovely deep shade of purple that doesn&#x27;t fade.

    <li> For me this shaver took sometime for me to get use to it. The blades seem to cut very low which is a plus for me. Best results for me was when my legs were wet. I like the wipes that came in the set as that as well was a huge plus after shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a devoted epilator user for many, many years now (outside of the brief time period where I fell off the epilation wagon), and have strictly used Braun epilators for the bulk of that time. In light of that, anyone that HAS been epilating for any length of time already knows that, yes, it hurts when you start out, and yes, the hair DOES grow back in finer over time. Yes, epilating also can cause ingrowns if you&#x27;re prone to that, and don&#x27;t exfoliate DAILY. But once you&#x27;ve gotten past your first three months of epilation, and have decided to stick with it long-term, it&#x27;s pretty much easy street. So, in light of that, I&#x27;m going to continue this review with a focus on the seasoned epilator as my targeted audience (if you ARE an epilation newbie, and DO still have questions, I did write a very lengthy review for the [[ASIN:B004QI8UJK Braun SE 5280 Silk Epil 5 Epilator With Ice Glove, Pink]], so hopefully, you&#x27;ll find that review more helpful, if this one doesn&#x27;t answer your questions)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned in my review for the SE 5280, I DID end up buying the [[ASIN:B0016GTOHC Braun SE7781 Silk-Epil Xpressive Epilator Body System, Rechargeable]] as a \\&quot;yay! I paid my car off!!!\\&quot; present to myself (I know, but that&#x27;s just the kind of girl I am!), and I ended up getting all of the extra attachments that didn&#x27;t come with it from multiple external websites, including theessentials dotcom, which is referenced from Braun&#x27;s direct website, and seems to have some items in stock, but others that they&#x27;ll need to order from the Braun factory, which would explain the two to three week delay (it didn&#x27;t take that long for them to get what I&#x27;d ordered from them last time around, though, just F.Y.I.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, the one thing that I must say I was happiest to find, though (for me, maybe not so much for you), is that the base rechargeable unit for this model, the SE 7781, and the [[ASIN:B0077PLO60 Braun Se5280 Silk-Epil Epilator, Pink]] is the exact same base unit, but for a few cosmetic tweaks. Good, if you have multiples of these lying around, in that the heads will all interchange, and you can use one base unit until it no longer holds a charge, then switch to the next base unit in order to continue with the same epilation and shaver heads. Bad, however, if you&#x27;ve shelled out for each in hopes that you&#x27;ll find vast differences between them, because, honestly, you won&#x27;t. Each of the units DOES have that nifty smartlight, which DOES make all the difference in the world, but outside of that, minor differences in color accents, and a slightly different look to the power dial on this and the other models, everything is the same. The epilation heads all attach and release in the same manner, and the pivoting feature on this model is due to a somewhat spring-like metal bar that is attached to the rear of the base epilation head&#x27;s barrel, and not the epilator body itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried any of the Emjoi epilators out there, and I initially got into epilation WAY back in my early High school days when the Epilady first came out. I&#x27;ve been dedicatedly using Braun epilators for sixteen years now, and have been more than happy with them. The tweezers on THIS model&#x27;s barrel HAVE seemed to remove hair more efficiently than what was attached to my SE 7781, but they both look exactly the same, so that may just be a slight factory issue. Either way, no, all of the hair likely won&#x27;t come off in the first pass, but if you&#x27;ve got an unepilated area that you&#x27;re working on, logic indicates to me that it would require more than a pass or two to efficiently remove all of the hair. For the newbies, you SHOULD epilate every day or every other day for the first week, at least, perhaps longer, if you&#x27;re trying to get every strand as close as possible to the same growth cycle, but once you&#x27;re over that initial training period, it really IS much faster and less painful to maintain your hair removal. If you DO choose to thoroughly epilate every square inch of your highly sensitive bikini area, be sure that you hold that skin as taut as you possibly can. In this, I find that the underarm cap (which will fit the standard epilation barrel, but does NOT come standard with most models), does the best job of getting those hairs without undue (!) pain. Said underarm cap will run you just under eight bucks, before shipping, on the site that the Braun site directs you to (you just have to go a few pages in, looking for the link that takes you to the authorized dealer&#x27;s website). For further, most-thorough-possible hair removal there, the chin cap is my final step. I ended up buying the precision head attachment for my 7781, thinking that its diminutive, eight-tweezer ball-shaped head and corresponding narrow opening cap would cover the bases better regarding hair removal for my bikini area, but really, it&#x27;s that underarm cap and chin cap that do the best job for me. Using a wet/dry model makes things easier in wetting the head of the epilator, while trying to keep my skin pulled taut (I know, it&#x27;s a bit of a juggling act, but that&#x27;s what works best for me), as the wet plastic cap over taut skin seems to do the most efficient job. That, and that glass of wine that all the reviewers keep mentioning, really do the trick. The wine because it relaxes me, and it also seems to numb the pain quite a bit. I THINK I tried a simple Ibuprofen initially, but my go-to is a good glass of wine to really relax me, and those sensitive nerve endings. Once that&#x27;s been ingested, and I&#x27;ve got the right caps for the task at hand, I&#x27;m good to go, and my skin is soon as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom, and for days at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I hope my suggestions here have been helpful, and, really, that I haven&#x27;t been TOO candid, but honestly, in all of my research prior to settling on that SE 7781 of mine, I looked high and low for information on thorough hair removal for ALL of the bikini area, and really never came across anything terribly thorough and informative, so... I apologize if this is just TOO much information for anyone, but hope that it helps those of you that just don&#x27;t quite know who to ask for a straight answer! ; ) And, if you&#x27;re okay with the price difference, and don&#x27;t feel like hunting all over the Internet, or creation, for a Braun model with all of the caps (but not epilation heads) that I&#x27;ve mentioned, go with the [[ASIN:B004TL9A7U Braun 7681 Silk-Epil 7 Xpressive Pro Epilator]].

    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Precision light (really usefull under shower or in a dark bathroom as mine)&lt;br /&gt;- Waterproof&lt;br /&gt;- Speed&lt;br /&gt;- Not as painfull as other models (but yes, it still painfull when you&#x27;re not used to this kind of epilation)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- About 40 minutes of use with one charge&lt;br /&gt;- Speed which is not as fast as it&#x27;s supposed to be when you use it for over 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t work really well under water, I often need to redo it after when my skin is dry.&lt;br /&gt;- Brokes a LOT of hair instead of pulling them out. Not so prettty.&lt;br /&gt;- The price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I dosen&#x27;t think the results justify spending 120$. This epilator needs a lot of ameliorations.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;After using it my grow faster and thicker. Also massage head, just didn&#x27;t work for me. I wanted to return but it was too late. Thinking of selling it.</li>
    <li> It left my legs covered in bumps and ingrown hairs everywhere. It has been 2 weeks since I used it and they are not getting better! If you have sensitive skin this is not for you. Horrible!  -Mrs. Worley</li>
    <li> The head broke down after 15 months of purchase and Amazon do not offer any repair/replacement option. We looked for a head in the local shops but we couldn&#x27;t find any. My partner had a Braun Shaver for over 8 years and he had recommended Braun, but this epilator really disappointed us.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this epilator.  I&#x27;ve epilated for years with an older Braun corded model and was very happy.  Then I bought this one.  Wow! What a difference.  It was well worth the higher price.  It is quicker, cleaner, and I&#x27;m no longer tethered to the nearest outlet.  Plus...I can do it in the shower now!</li>
    <li> Pros Good quality product, I have been using it for more than two years and it never gave me any technical problem. Not messy like waxing Less costly in long term compared to parlor waxing. Time of hair growth - slower than shaving. Can be used both dry and wet Cons More time consuming than waxing. Charge runs out quickly, I cannot do more than half leg at a time. Time of hair growth - faster compared with waxing Plucks soft skin and causes horrible pain and bruises. I can never do my hands with it :(</li>
    <li> Awesome awesome!  Hurry bad the first couple times I used it but if you maintain it doesn&#x27;t even hurt.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my DBF has the inside scoop with an Amazon employee since I keep getting epilators offered to me to test -  (Just kidding, neither of us know a soul who works for Amazon), but he&#x27;s always complaining about my leg stubble.  I tried epilating a couple years ago but it hurt, so I went back to using Nair.  His opinion is I don&#x27;t Nair often enough, but I have blonde, fine leg hair and you have to wait for it to grow out a little to use either an electric razor or Nair.  I decided to try epilating once again. Just once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with this model&#x27;s features, such as it being cord-free and able to use this in the shower (wet or dry); the pivoting head is good for around the knee area; however, it was still painful.  I have a very low tolerance for pain.  I tried it wet - I tried it dry.  No difference.  I ended up doing one of my legs, and Nair&#x27;d the other. This works great as far as hair removal, so I&#x27;m still giving it 4 stars since we all have different pain thresholds.  If you think you can handle having your leg hair being yanked out by its roots, give it a try. Some of us are just not cut out for this.</li>
    <li> When I first used this product it was really painful but as time has gone on the pain lessens. My legs were silky smooth but not for six weeks. I am overall happy with this product. I reccomend exfoliating your legs three times a week to prevent ingrowns.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item when I &#x27;lost&#x27; my Braun epilator. This has to be the worst (&amp; most expensive) shaver that I have ever purchased. To be fair it may be operator error or a faulty product &amp; I would hope to hear from Braun to discuss this but I am not holding my breath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently reduced to wet shaving with cuts everywhere until I can order another shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless I hear from Braun I will not be buying from them again!</li>
    <li> Ok... so those were not the exact expletives that were used at that very first moment.  I have never used an epilator.  This is my personal experience as an Epilating Virgin.  I suffer from ingrown hairs on the outer part of my lower legs (below knee).  I carefully unpacked the package, Braun epilation wipes, read the instructions/care manual and charged my new device for a bit.  I couldn&#x27;t wait for too long so I cleaned my legs with the wipe.  The wipe does nothing but clean your legs and make them smell great.  Seems a very &#x27;placeboish&#x27; product.  I read up on online forums and took pain killers because it would supposedly reduce inflammation and pain later on.  Now onto the epilating...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sound when turned on is very nerve-wracking even on it&#x27;s low setting or as I refer to it as, \\&quot;chicken speed\\&quot;.  It made me nervous and a bit uneasy, but I still braved on!  OH MY!!  Add a few expletives and constant, OUCHES, OH MY GOD, HOLY HELL and so on and you get my point.  The kids came to my bedroom because they heard the commotion.  Trying to describe it, I would say it feels like lightening rods.  I believe that sensation is translating that way because you are tweezing 40 hairs at the same time.  When you tweeze one leg hair you feel that momentary Peter Griffin moment of, \\&quot;Ahh SSSSS Ahh SSS\\&quot;.  Multiply that by 40 times; hence my swearing as if I was being tazered.  So there I was and five minutes later I was epilating up and down my leg like a pro and even going into the top speed.  It no longer hurt!  Who would have thought that the pain would subside?  Rather that you could get used to that sensation.  I moved to my knee and the pain came rushing back; knees are painful and continue to be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience:  Initially I was nervous, just from the sound of the whirring.  I am so happy that I went through with it.  Excitedly I looked at the calendar so that I could put into my review the exact number of days between epilation.  I lost my epilator virginity on June 9th, 2012.  Today is June 20th, 2012 and I have not epilated nor shaved my legs since that day.  How do they feel?  They feel like day number 3-4 after shaving (depending on how quickly your hair grows).  This is insane and I only wish that I could have discovered this product sooner.  I have stocked up on the Braun wipes even though I believe they didn&#x27;t do anything.  Today I used it in the shower on my underarms.  The pain was excruciating and I had a dot of blood without it catching the hair.  I immediately stopped.  It wasn&#x27;t worth it and I am not sure if the water makes it more difficult for the hair to be caught.  The underarms will remain a strictly shaving region; as much as I loathe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair type/Skin color&lt;br /&gt;I am Caucasian and have very very fair skin that bruises easily.  Waxing leaves me red for two days but the epilation went smoothly without any snags.  A couple of hours later and my legs were not red and there were not any scabs.  It does not help with the ingrown hairs and I have to still manually remove them.  This has me motivated to pick up my exfoliation so that I could get to the bottom of those pesky ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend and suggest sticking past the first few minutes.  I am excited and my husband remarked how my legs felt great even though it has been so long since the last time.  Do I have that freshly smooth waxed feeling?  No, I don&#x27;t, but my legs have never been hair free and as smooth as this for 11 days.ginity on June 9th, 2012.

    <li> Easy to use, works perfectly&lt;br /&gt;It hurts a lot in the first couple of times and still cant use it except for my arms and legs, yet im so happy with it and definitely recommend it. Good product, reasonable price</li>
    <li> It catches on your skin and tears it. I do not recommend purchasing this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used epilators before and have stuck with it because I don&#x27;t mind the prickling and I loved the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, this specific one is just awful:&lt;br /&gt;- I get ingrown hairs (has never happened before)&lt;br /&gt;- my pores are larger (never happened before either)&lt;br /&gt;- it&#x27;s inefficient (doesn&#x27;t really take out my hairs)&lt;br /&gt;- it takes a long time (and the charge won&#x27;t last for me to full epilate my legs)&lt;br /&gt;- it&#x27;s EXPENSIVE&lt;br /&gt;- their customer service sucks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been calling in for their 60 day guarantee service, but I only get an automated machine that tells me an address to return it to (the machine says it too fast for me to write it down) and if I don&#x27;t call within business hours (9am-5pm est), then I don&#x27;t get any help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What. Kind. Of. BS. Is. This.</li>
    <li> I like this item because it&#x27;s wireless. The tweezers are working ok but my 10 year old braun works better. And the head is two big, so it makes difficult to reach the skin.</li>
    <li> After purchasing the Braun Series 5-5185 Silk Epil Epilator \\&quot;which was desribed to be cordless\\&quot;  I returned it and decided that I would spend the extra money  and upgrade to a real cordless and the bonus of being able to use it wet or dry.  Charged it for one hour like the description said and it works great.  I feel I have a high tolerance for pain so it really doesn&#x27;t bother me. For others it will. Just have a glass of wine or two and you will be fine.  I did use it on my underarms and yes then it can bring tears to your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend actually sold me on the Epil as she has used hers for about 3 years and has no hair grow at all. I would highly recommend on purcahsing it.  It&#x27;s better for me as I dont have to quick shave everyday missing strips of hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8-31-13 Update&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still working great and legs are nice and smooth. I did forget to mention that you will experience some ingrown hairs here and there. Note The Epil will slowly weaken your hair roots so they won&#x27;t grow back. So do not shave with a razor as it will strengthen your hair roots.</li>
    <li> I really love this product!&lt;br /&gt;its really good to use when you need to shave fast&lt;br /&gt;i am glad i got this product!</li>
    <li> I have been epilating for years and was quite happy with my older Braun model (the corded Silk Epil Xelle), which seems to me to be enough epilator for a beginner. The Xelle is still running strong after four years of use and abuse. But I didn&#x27;t want to miss out if the technology has improved substantially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy a new epilator to travel with (the old one has a big clunky electric plug) and chose this one because 1) it&#x27;s cordless and 2) it can be used in and cleaned with water. I was also curious about the technology that is supposed to catch the shortest hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t completely convinced when I first used it. It has a head that pivots around when you&#x27;re using it, which makes it more difficult to see what it got and what it didn&#x27;t. On the plus side, the pivoting head seems to catch most of the hairs instead of launching them all around the bathroom like my old one did. After a few minutes, I learned to have faith in the thing and just trust that it had gotten the hairs I went over-- which it did a remarkable job doing, better than the older model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The model is also travel friendly, even the charger is petite enough not to be annoying in a carry-on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After use number one, I was totally pleased. I had shave-soft legs for a couple of days, which I didn&#x27;t generally get with the old model-- usually my legs would look bare but feel bumpy here and there. So the catch-small-hairs feature seems to work OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any problem with the machine catching my skin which other reviewers complained about. The pivoting head did get some friction with my legs and kind of snap back and forth in an inelegant way, but this didn&#x27;t affect the utility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, the second time I came to use it, the wheel with the tweezers on it seemed to get off balance and it didn&#x27;t spin correctly. It click-click-clicked around and then stopped entirely. I returned it-- will not order it again because for $70 I don&#x27;t want torisk getting a delicate little machine. Maybe I will try again with the next Braun generation...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS a tip to get the most out of epilating: rub a face toner with salicylic acid in it on your legs regularly to keep away ingrown hairs. If you get ingrowns, scrubbing with melted down aspirin tablets gets them out quickly and brings down the angry red spots.</li>
    <li> Previously I used Panasonic&#x27;s wet/dry epilator and loved it...I use it on my upper lip and bikini area every few days and can&#x27;t live without it.  Braun&#x27;s epilator is good, but I still prefer Panasonic&#x27;s...I epilated my upper lip and Braun&#x27;s pinched my lip painfully, something that NEVER happened with my Panasonic.</li>
    <li> This epilator does a great job.  I have been using an epilator for many years and I have used many brands.  Braun is always the best.  This is the first epilator I have had that didn&#x27;t have to be plugged in while I used it.  I like the freedom of not having to be by an outlet.</li>
    <li> I got this product because my sister had recently gotten one and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the epilator, I don&#x27;t have to shave as often and the hair that grows back is thinner.  This product holds it&#x27;s charge really well and is very easy to use.  Great quality for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. The first time you use the epilator it&#x27;s painful, but still tolerable.  Each use afterwards hasn&#x27;t been nearly as painful as the first use.  Don&#x27;t let the first round deter you from using it (Also, be sure to use it at night especially the first time because your skin will be a little red and splotchy -- like when you pluck/wax your eyebrows.  I wasn&#x27;t aware of that the first time and just wore jeans that day)</li>
    <li> Yes, that is correct, prepare to be dazzled after the pain of course! Does it hurt? I will not lie and say it was a breeze. It is painful but the good news is that it gets better each time and you have to epilate less often as well. If you have always shaved and never waxed or epilated, you will never have felt legs or arms as soft. I&#x27;m reviewing both the Braun Se7181 and Se7681 since I have both and this review is for the 7181 model. Both the models are very similar except this one DOES NOT have a shaver attachment, facial and underarm cap along with a trimmer cap. Honestly, the only cap I liked is the underarm one and once you&#x27;re used to the feeling, you may not even use that. I mostly tried this on my arms and legs. This first time I used it, it was hard to get used to the yanking of the hair. I had tried an epilator in the past but gave up too soon due to the pain. So far, my legs and arms feel very smooth. The first time you use it, you will have to do it everyday for the first 3-4 days since new hair grow everyday. After that, you will notice the hair growth becoming slower and less painful and the no stubble feel is awesome. I do have red bumps on my skin for a few hours after epilation but I apply the Body Shop Aloe Body Butter and it just disappears after a while. If you have more sensitive skin, you may have them for a while longer. This unit also has epilation wipes which numb the area a little bit. I tried them and while the pain doesn&#x27;t go away, it does make a difference. This is a wet or dry cordless device which means you can use it in the shower as well. Since the pain isn&#x27;t too bad now, I haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower but you may want to try that incase it&#x27;s very painful for you. It charges quickly in under an hour and lasts for a good 40-50 minutes of epilation. The light feature is simply wonderful since with the light shining for the epilator, it is very easy to yank even the finest hair. I would say if you stick with this for a few days and bear the pain, you will never go back to shaving again.</li>
    <li> This thing really, really hurts.  I used it once and got a lot of ingrowns when the hair returned.  I wasn&#x27;t really interested in going through the pain of using it again only to have my legs look like minefields with ingrown hairs for two weeks afterwards.After I use it on my face I look ten years younger and my skin looks brighter because it doesn&#x27;t have a fine layer of fuzz making it look dull and ancient.  I love this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helps you.  If you have a question, just leave it in the comments below - I usually answer questions or comments within a few hours.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t be the only one here who once owned the notoriously hideous \\&quot;Epilady\\&quot; back in the 80s or early 90s, can I?  I had that thing, and probably used it twice, and could stand the pain no more.  I expected this might be similar, but I was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Silk Epil has some features that (I think) reduce the pain caused by (let&#x27;s be blunt) the ripping out of the hairs.  For one thing, it vibrates -- I think this must be the key to reducing the pain.  You know, you get stung, and you rub your skin to make it feel better -- this vibration thing seems to have a similar effect.  Yes, it hurts a bit, but it&#x27;s not that bad.  Besides, we&#x27;re women, we can take it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, this thing can be used when you&#x27;re soaking in a warm bath, which (for me, anyway) eases the comfort quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it has two speeds: Low (or \\&quot;tolerable\\&quot; as I would call it), and High (or \\&quot;don&#x27;t even go there,\\&quot; as I would call it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few seconds I used this thing, I thought, OUCH!  But I really was surprised that after a minute or two, I really did start to get used to it.  For your legs, it ain&#x27;t bad.  Now, on the bikini line, that&#x27;s a different story -- that took me a few \\&quot;rounds\\&quot; over a few days to get through...but no big surprise there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried it on my upper lip and underarms, just for kicks, and in those locations...well, I got through the lip (small enough area to take it), but the underarms?  No way!!  Just too painful (though when I get waxed, I do find that my underarms are quite a bit more painful that any other area, so that may just be me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with the Silk Epil.  If you mainly want it for your legs, you&#x27;ll probably find it tolerable enough, especially when you are doing \\&quot;maintenance\\&quot; work after that first session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and my hair had to only grow out for about 4 or 5 days for this thing to grab the hair -- much less hair growth required than for waxing.  That&#x27;s a big plus for me.</li>
    <li> The product is absolute value for money and extremely efficient. Braun as a company makes really good product and this is definitely one of them. The fact that it is wireless and chargeable is a definite plus!</li>
    <li> I will never shave again!!! Love this product, obviously it does hurt because it&#x27;s tweezing out the hair, but you get use to it after a while like you do tweezing your eyebrows. Definitely saving me money on shaving products so that&#x27;s a big plus too!</li>
    <li> Love it, works great!! The only problem I have is that it scares my cat but she&#x27;s a trauma kitty and everything scarce her. The other razors don&#x27;t work for me because I&#x27;m blonde they seem to be mostly for women with dark hair, Even the very expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kathy, CA</li>
    <li> So, this thing is awesome. I&#x27;ll admit the first use should be classified as illegal torture but keeping up with it has been nothing. I would suggest for your first use you get your legs waxed then use it frequently as the hair starts growing in. Don&#x27;t have the expectation that you will have perfectly smooth skin; This won&#x27;t get every single baby fine hair you have.  I read the reviews before choosing this one and I have been very pleased.  I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will note I didn&#x27;t think it worked well in the shower. I had expected to use it exclusively in the shower but I found I prefer to use it dry.</li>
    <li> i used to use epilady, not any more!!! this silk-epil 7 kicks epilady&#x27;s butt. first, the silk-epil 7 came charged and ready to go. nice! second, my legs were done in a tenth of the time. the silk-epil 7 pulled almost al of the hairs on the first pass (the epilady often took 5 passes or even more to pull some hairs). my legs feel sooooo smooth with the silk-epil 7 (much smoother than the epilady ever did). the silk-epil 7 fits in my hand better, has a prettier carrying bag and packs away better than the epilady did. i can&#x27;t tell you how happy I am with SILK-EPIL 7, it is the BEST. it really is.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun epilators for several years and have a collection of four or five--they are that good. Each innovation actually is an improvement, and having one I can use in the shower is a real plus. I understand that some people do not like the use of epilators because of pain, although I have not experienced any. The Silk-Epil 7181 gives nicer, longer-lasting results than any other type of hair removal I&#x27;ve tried, comparable to professional waxing. And, unlike razors, it does not remove the top layer of skin or irritate sensitive skin. Continued, regular use of Braun Silk-Epils has resulted in finer (and seemingly less) hair and slower growth. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> I was one of the many thousands who invested in one of the original epilators, thinking, that this would  be the end of all the shaving and I would stay hair free for ages!  Well, as others can testify, it was one of the most painful experiences of my life!  I could only ever managed one leg at a time, usually after a warm bath/shower to allow the hair follicle to be more &#x27;open&#x27;, so hopefully less painful!  Eventually the leg just went numb.  After a number of goes, the torture contraption just got thrown into the back of the wardrobe and forgotten about.  I did come across it recently, and was tempted to try it again, but back it went, with a shudder of remembered pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after much deliberation I decided to take the plunge again, and decided upon this model after reading the reviews which seemed to suggest that the pain was no where near as bad, and even, virtually painless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this model over the Braun 7681 with all the different heads.  I only really wanted it for my legs and underarms, so all the extra heads really weren&#x27;t worth the extra in price for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the item duly arrived (within 5 days from Amazon to Sydney! So I was very impressed with the delivery service).  Because this item was from America and I live in Australia, the charging cable had a US plug, but this wasn&#x27;t a problem as Hubby has a Braun electric shaver and hey presto, the charger fits this unit.  So no worries!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this out on my legs in the shower, as the water hopefully will help the epilator to glide over my leg and also the hair follicles will be warm and hopefully will ease the process.  So, with the pain of my previous experience charging to the front of my mind, I began the process, and to my amazement, there was virtually no pain!  I am not saying I didn&#x27;t feel anything, but it was no worse than having my legs waxed.  I must admit at this point, I was using it on the &#x27;wimp&#x27; setting with the &#x27;wimp&#x27; head on and haven&#x27;tyet progressed to the &#x27;non-wimp&#x27; setting and efficiency head, but so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also plucked up the courage to use this on the recent regrowth on my underarms, which I waxed a couple of weeks ago.  Again, I did this in the shower for the reasons already stated, and again virtually painfree, I have had worse underarm waxings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently I have not yet plucked up the courage to try the bikini line yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may make a difference to the pain issue if you have been waxing for a few years, which I have, also I am not a &#x27;hairy&#x27; monster, being fair and of Northern European by birth.  Another tip maybe to make sure that the hair is not long when you attempt to epilate. Bit like when you leave the hair to get long before waxing, it seems to hurt a lot more than when it is shorter.  So if you have never epilated or waxed, it might be worth shaving your legs first off and then when you have a small amount of regrowth then try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I am very happy with this product, and it should pay for itself very quickly when you consider the cost of a waxing at the beauticians or the cost of home waxing kits.  Hopefully, I can now keep myself nice and hair free without having to put up with the hair regrowth between waxings and having to hide fluffy legs! Or returning to shaving, which I was not keen to do as I am not keen on the stubbly regrowth feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and effective.  Use under water is a plus although I prefer dry use.  Significant improvement over the older models in terms of battery life.</li>
    <li> It works but I feel like it may work better dry than wet.  It does work though, but if you go against your hairline by accident it creates little bumps :(</li>
    <li> It works fast, battery is not bad at all, pretty easy to clean and cute &#x3D;) Really happy with it.</li>
    <li> After use the beautiful begins to grow thinner, besides taking the shortest is beautiful and the best thing is super safe</li>
    <li> Works very well.  I had an earlier Braun model and this one is less painful and works much quicker.  I have not used it in the shower, but the epilator works well dry.</li>
    <li> Works good and is efficient as described.  but I forgot america has different power points. This has been annoying :/</li>
    <li> Love, love, love, love , love, this thing. I got soooo sick to death of shaving and wanted something easier and something to keep me smooth.&lt;br /&gt;To anyone that has never plucked mass quantities of hair all at once, yes... certain areas are hell and the hair folicles get pissed off at being ripped out. So don&#x27;t be surprised when you see a little blood. The legs were a breeze, the vj was...challenging, and the pits were murder. Pulling the skin flat is pretty crucial downstairs. The pits...you&#x27;re at the mercy of your own steady hand.&lt;br /&gt;Glide the epilator gently across your skin multiple times to pick up all the shorties. Whatever you do, resist the urge to push down!!!! That is NOT how it works.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I use it every few days to just pluck any new growth and I&#x27;m smooth as silk everywhere. After the first time, it&#x27;s easy peasy, lemon squeezy. I will never waste money on razors or shavers again!!!!! So impressed that it really does grab the hairs and gets them root and all. I figured the hairs would snap or break, but this thing is perfectly awesome!!!</li>
    <li> love it! very easy use and smooth. will definately recommend!</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how little this hurt when I used it on my legs. Now, I&#x27;m a person who gets my legs waxed, so I am used to a fair amount of hair-removal pain. But this allows me to actually maintain the hairlessness of my legs. Unlike with waxing, I don&#x27;t have to wait anywhere near as long for the hair to grow in before I pull it out again. They&#x27;re also not kidding about the difference between waxing, which inevitably sticks to your skin to some degree, and this tool which only pulls out the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used this on more sensitive skin than the legs, so you&#x27;ll have to look at other reviews for that.</li>
    <li> I really like the Silk Epil it does a clean shave and lasts a long time, have been using one for over 30 years and don&#x27;t have to shave my legs but every six weeks.</li>
    <li> Best one I have ever owned. Would definately recommend this product</li>
    <li> Pretty much like the other models of EpiLady! It does a good job but after the advertising, I expected a closer shave for the money. I&#x27;d go with the basic model next time.</li>
    <li> It does work if you can stand the pain... i could not handle it but the areas i did do doesnt have hair anymore</li>
    <li> Comfortable, easy to use, removes leg hair well.  Little light is good for spotting those stray hairs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been frustrated with shaving.  I shave my legs nearly every other day and I shave my underarms at least once a day!  Nonetheless, my legs felt fuzzy within hours and my underarms always look so dark!  So I did some research on hair removal methods.  Waxing?  To expensive at a salon and too messy at home.  Plus, you have to let the hair grow so long! Shaving?  We&#x27;ll I&#x27;ve explained that already.  Laser?  Yeah, with what bank account?  Epilating seemed potentially painful, but potentially magical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when my mom asked what I wanted for my birthday, I quickly asked for an epilator.  She had me do some research and order it myself, since my husband and I recently moved out of state.  I did some research and figured out a few features I was looking for:&lt;br /&gt;At least 40 tweezers (more tweezers&#x3D;less pain)&lt;br /&gt;A pivoting head&lt;br /&gt;Wet and Dry&lt;br /&gt;A light&lt;br /&gt;Rechargeable&lt;br /&gt;So I did a lot of research before finally finding this epilator, which has all of the features I was wanting!  The price isn&#x27;t fabulous, but just a few months use, it will cost less than buying razors and shaving gel!  So I ordered this bad boy and, rather impatiently, waited for it to arrive.  Nine days later, it finally showed up in the mail box and I was ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I charged it (which only takes an hour) and set to it.  This epilator&#x27;s battery only lasts 40 minutes, and I&#x27;ve ready stories about the first epilation taking 3 hours or more!  Luckily, it didn&#x27;t take me nearly as long.  I started on my underarms.  I figured I would never be so brave again, and jumping right into a sensitive area might make my legs easier.  I pulled the skin tight, and set to it.  It hurt, bad.  But not too bad.  I trucked on through and then worked my way to my legs.&lt;br /&gt;About 30 minutes later, I had smooth legs and armpits.  That&#x27;s been a few days ago, my legs are silky smooth, and my armpits have never looked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all my features, the only I would change is maybemy tweezer limit.  Emjoi has a lot of 36 tweezer models, and I don&#x27;t think losing 4 tweezers would really kill me.  All of the other features, I love.  The pivoting head is great for knees and ankles, the light helps me notice hairs I would have missed, the wet and dry feature means I can relax in the tub while I epilate, and I couldn&#x27;t picture buying batteries for the thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that this model doesn&#x27;t work when it&#x27;s plugged in.  I could see it being an issue if I need to go out or something, and my epilator isn&#x27;t charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, I&#x27;m satisfied with this epilator and I think it&#x27;s a huge step up from my old shaving routine.  If you can get through the first epilation, I think you&#x27;ll be sold too!</li>
    <li> I love this epilator, it is so gentle compared to my old first generation epilady. The charge on this item only lasts about a half hour though, barely enough time to get everything done. The downside of this product is that you can&#x27;t use it WHILE it&#x27;s charging. But on the plus side you can use it wet or dry and it&#x27;s wireless! I loved it so much I bought one for my mom in orange.</li>
    <li> This is not my first time epilating but I am not experinced, I had used my sisters emjoi (not the one with 72 tweezers, the purple basic type).  I liked hers well enough, I used it on my leg dry.  My sister is as thorough as I am so when she said she would have bought this model (now that she has experience) I took it seriously.  I pained over this one or the next model (the one that is $100) or the panasonic ($90).  I read many reviews and decided that the additional attachments that go with the higher 7000 series models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have just used this and wanted to write the review while it is fresh on my mind.  I used this one my legs- I had anticipated this product (as a birthday gift) so I have not shaved for a few weeks (my husband is in Afghanistan).  I was concerned that the long hair would not pull out but just break so I used a hair trimmer in the opposite direction to get my leg hair somewhat short and even.  I use a dry body brush (i can not recommend this routine enough- it got rid of the little bumps on the back of my thighs) and took a warm shower.  I dried off, sat on the edge of my tub, and began.  It was very gratifying to see all the hair laying on the floor of my tub.  It was mildly uncomfortable- you are pulling hair out of the root!  Some of the areas that were more sensitive, I would go over quick with a few storkes to take some at a time then go over with slower longer strokes.  I very much liked the pivoting head- the hair on the back of my calves grows sideways.  The light was a great bonus too- my overhead light is at the end of the tub but I was sitting near the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a few passes to be acceptable- but I am giving a littlle leeway since I haven&#x27;t shaved in a while and the hairs were fine.  My knees were a little more sensitive so I kept my leg straight and pulled the skin taut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My armpits were painful- I actually yelled a little.  I then used the same technique where I would do a few quick strokes so I wasn&#x27;t pulling all the hair out at once and was a great help.  I made sure to go in all directions and was pretty pleased with the result.  There was none of the usual &amp;#34;five o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34; and I never realized I could be without it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The epilation did leave red marks everywhere- little circles where the hair had extracted (it has been about one hour and the red is about half of what it was).  I did not apply any lotion or deodorant or any topicals like hydrocortizone cream.  I am letting it go down on its own and keeping my arms out a little so my armpit area can stay dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try to remember to edit this and keep an update over a longer bit of time.  I should also say that I am Korean American (Irish/English) mix and I am very susceptible to ingrown hairs.sn&#x27;t pulling all the hair out at once and was a great help.

    <li> Needed one for a couple of facial hairs , this was the wrong one will return as soon as I can get a return receipt printed</li>
    <li> My girlfriend used my account to order this and returned it because she had to press pretty hard down to get really close to the skin. The caps make the epilator elevated from the skin. She did say she had the closest and best hair removal on the legs, however, the caps made it too difficult. Hair also gets trapped in the caps and it was very difficult to clean out the whole system. For this price, she expected the product to be easier to use and clean.</li>
    <li> I love the epil it so easy to work with wet or dry like it says and I don&#x27;t have to shave that often. Love it!</li>
    <li> i bought this 2 months ago, it is good but  the only thing is on charging i preferred to use it by using wire too because sometimes during using it need to be charged and it can not work by  wire so it need to wait to be charged and i don&#x27;t like this.</li>
    <li> This is my ever first epilator after only waxing and shaving. I love how it is near painless and how it is functional without having to be plugged in. HOWEVER, i have found a few flaws.&lt;br /&gt;1.) I have found the battery to not last a long time. I finished a leg and a half before the battery ran out. It&#x27;s not too bad, but it was an inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;2.) The epilator caught my skin and pinched it along with my hairs a few times. It seriously stings and hurts. :/&lt;br /&gt;3.) I found that if the hair stuck in the epilator is not cleaned out after a while, then it works less efficiently. It was a hassle to constantly empty out the hairs.</li>
    <li> I just got this thing today.  I didn&#x27;t use it after a shower or in the shower.  I just took it out and used it on high speed.  It hurt like hell.  I should have read the directions.  Despite hurting like hell,  it did what it&#x27;s supposed to,  rip the hairs out by the root.  Wow</li>
    <li> Battery dies very soon, doesn&#x27;t work while charging</li>
    <li> Having used an epilator since 1985 I know my way around them. I don&#x27;t use razors--they weird me out. After the initial shock of hair being ripped out there&#x27;s nothing to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always bought Epilady products. Unfortunately, every few years the adapter&#x27;s motor goes and then I shop around Radio Shack for a new adapter for a replacement until that one burns out. The last time I bought a new Epilady I hated it. It made big claims such as \\&quot;Quieter, faster, better ...\\&quot; and pssst, frankly, in every way it was worse worse worse. When I called customer service the male sales clerk told me I was clearly doing it wrong and that all I had to do was learn to do it right. Then I&#x27;d see: it WOULD be better better better. The jerk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw threw it away and for 4 long years I used the older Epilady--the one whose adapter died--with an adapter from my father&#x27;s electric razor. It ran on the wrong current and it ran slooooowly but it worked. Until recently I didn&#x27;t even know there were coil epilators made by other companies. Then that one died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that annoying customer disservice guy (whom I&#x27;m assuming has never used an epilator in his life) telling me I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing is the PERFECT way of insuring I&#x27;ll never buy another Epilady again. I did a bit of Google-ing and lo and behold: Braun. Even the name--you trust it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Braun product works fabulously. It takes a quarter of the time it took me to use the Epilady. There&#x27;s a function light that sweeps in the direction you are moving the rotating coil, which helps aging eyes. It has never removed a chunk of the loose skin in my arm pits the way the Epilady did. It runs on a charge without electricity. And it&#x27;s pretty quiet. Talk about BETTER BETTER BETTER. I&#x27;m thoroughly satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s probably too much to ask the manufacturers to design it with accent colors other THAN PINK. Gah, so girly. Why not GREEN?the root of the hairs in my legs.  Could this be?</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says.... Which is why I never use it.  This thing was made in the bowels of hell I&#x27;m pretty sure.  Got it to use on my baking area and didn&#x27;t get too far.  I have a pretty high pain tolerance and this was too much for me.</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun epilator. I hadn&#x27;t epilated my legs for 3 months and shaved once 2 months ago as I don&#x27;t have my old epilator with me. So the hair on my legs was more than double the recommended length. I expected it to hurt more than normal, but was surprised. The fronts of my legs which are bonnier and the hair coarser, the pain was the same as my old one. The backs of my legs didn&#x27;t hurt as much as the hair is finer. I think the new massaging rollers must make a difference. With the hair so long I wasn&#x27;t expecting great results but my legs felt like I had used a razor, they were so smooth. A couple of hairs broke off but I&#x27;m sure this is because they where so long, can&#x27;t wait to see how it goes next time. I like the way the rotating head follows the curves of my legs and its nice not being attached to a wall plug, so you can do them anywhere. I&#x27;m impressed. The wattage is 100-240 so I will be able to use it anywhere in the world with a plug adapter. I bought it through Amazon and was impressed at the quick delivery to Alaska.</li>
    <li> I was extremely disappointed. I tried using it after shower. I used it 4 days in a row then skipped a couple of days. My legs felt just like they would have if I had shaved two days ago. All it was doing was breaking the hair off at surface.  Stick with shaving or waxing.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! The light makes it so much easier!!!</li>
    <li> I would just warn people that epilation causes a lot of ingrown hairs, so don&#x27;t use epilators too often! Also, they hurt like the dickens for the first few uses, but I got accustomed to the pain over time. My underarms bled a little when I tried epilating in that area—mostly I use this on my legs, which is less painful. But everyone is different, so if you&#x27;re willing to endure some stinging, I suggest giving it a try.</li>
    <li> Epilating will always be painful. I have a hate-love relationship with this bugger. It gets the job done great, but the pain...oh the pain...</li>
    <li> I was concerned that this might be so painful that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it. It&#x27;s really not that bad at all. I&#x27;ve used it 3 times and it seems to be getting easier each time. I&#x27;ve waxed my legs before and this is much better I think. Since your hairs grow at different times I use it twice a week This keeps the new hair growth removed and my legs smooth.</li>
    <li> This was my first time buying/ using an epilator and I am very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Some things to keep in mind when  you get started:&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it will hurt (about the same as waxing) Because of this you many not get perfect results the first few times. If you pull away or jump when you feel a pinch you&#x27;re probably going to break the hair, instead of pulling it out. Especially if your hair isn&#x27;t the right length or very dense. Practice helps and with continuous use the hair will come back thinner and thinner and pull out with less effort/ pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the epilator most of the summer, I just go over the area once a week to catch any stray hairs and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holds a charge well, easy to clean, nice accessories to fit your preferences.</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to this purchase.  No more shaving would be amazing.  But for me, it only pulls out some of the hairs.  It breaks off many so my legs are never truly smooth.  It has that prickly feel to it that might usually be felt after a couple days of not shaving.  Maybe I am doing something wrong. But I do not think so because it is pretty straightforward.</li>
    <li> I use it for armpits, arms and legs, it lasts longer than shaving and after 1 month using it I&#x27;m still loving it .It takes a bit to get used to the sensation and it&#x27;s a big ouch if you grab your skin but as long as you learn the technique you won&#x27;t regret  it. Oh and of course, exfoliate!!  that is the only way to avoid ingrown hairs</li>
    <li> It does its job, and is usable under shower. I don&#x27;t use it that much tho, but just know that I have it if necessary. Recommend!</li>
    <li> at the time of ordering this Epilator, i was thinking that i might be the fake one (made i china) but because of the authenticate return policy, i thought to try once. And today I am very happy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Star to this product. I would definitely recommend this product to friends.</li>
    <li> First time using an epliator, it was intimitating at first but then once you get going it&#x27;s fine. I found using shorter strokes worked better than longer ones as it seemed to give the skin (and mind) a bit of a break. Have not tried it wet and probably won&#x27;t as dry seemed to be just fine. Good Luck!</li>
    <li> Vary fast delivery. My daughter is seticfied.</li>
    <li> Does what it says, but man is it painful! I have not been able to get my legs completely smooth, but as someone who cannot shave because of the irritation it causes, I am happy.</li>
    <li> I must admit it hurts...but it does the job!!! I want to use it on my underarms so bad but the pain!!!! lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast Delivery thanks!</li>
    <li> After purchasing the nair roll on wax wax and being highly disappointed I began my search for a better wax product. The nair wax left me with nasty red bumps, I began doing research on using organic extra virgin coconut oil for aftercare. This lead me to a wonderful blog on a website designed for Indian women. The article &amp;#34;Waxing vs. Epilating&amp;#34; was quite an eye opener. I soon realized this search had turned into me running down the rabbit hole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing extensive research on different epilators, I set forth to Walmart to purchase one of the $30 epilators that had received decent reviews. To my dismay they were all sold out... silly me thinking in the middle of July they would be in stock. I then headed over to target to see if they had some in stock. Sadly they did not. The only one in stock was the Braun series 7-7181 Silk Epil WD at a hefty price tag of $100! I reluctantly purchased this product and hoped it worked as well as the reviews had stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On day one I think it is safe to say I have become and addict! I absolutely love this thing. I am Caucasian with fair skin and white almost clear body hair. It hurt like a SOB at first but after doing my calf on the lowest setting with the massager I switch to the other head and the higher setting. I am a little bummed at its performance on the back of my thighs. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because my hair is thinner back there and it couldn&#x27;t grip it as easily or what but it left me wanting more. Since I had waxed a few days prior, the hair the wax didn&#x27;t pick up was 7 days without shaving.  But WOW are my legs silky smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, lets move on to the pits... my armpits that is. I knew this would hurt far worse than my legs but WOWZA. I had to keep making a conscious effort to remember to breathe. I found the best technique was to raise my arm above my head bend at the elbow and prop my arm against the closed bathroom door and watch in the mirror. I would much rather go through a million Brazilian waxes than go through that pain again. But as I sit here typing only 5 hours after the ordeal, and feeling how smooth my pits are I may just have to try it again. As for my lady bits, I think I will stick to using a hard wax.</li>
    <li> I bought the Braun Epilator actually by mistake.  I meant to buy a lady shaver, more for the bikini area than anything else.  I hate waxing, it&#x27;s messy and hurts like hell.  After getting home and realizing my mistake I decided to give it a try anyway.  I charged it up and after taking a warm shower tried it out.  I know it says not to use anything on the skin that&#x27;s greasy like lotion or oil but I did soap up my legs with bar soap and water and tried it out.  I will be honest and say the first time I used it, it hurt like hell.  But I kept at it and the pain was easier to handle.  I tried it on the arm pits and I won&#x27;t lie that hurt like you wouldn&#x27;t believe but I continued on.  Now, as I stated above I really wanted something for the bikini area so that I could stop waxing and I hate shaving, shaving just leaves sharp razor stubble behind which I hate.  Since I do wax I had hair but not tons and it wasn&#x27;t long.  It hurt, about the same as the legs but the pain got easier the longer I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first use, I did feel some hairs that were left behind, which was my fault I don&#x27;t think I went back over the area as good as I should have since it was my first time and I was adjusting to the pain.  I cleaned the epilator really good, charged it back up and put it back in the box until next time.  Two days later I decided to give it a try again and get the hairs I left behind.  This time the pain was very light and only in the beginning.  I went over my legs, underarms and bikini area again and I have to say I love this thing.&lt;br /&gt;My legs have never been smoother.  The bikini area has never been smoother unless waxed.  My underarms, I have dark hair so even when I used to wax and the hair was gone if I lifted my arm up you could see a dark patch.  Now when I lift my arm since it removes the hair like plucking them out all I see is my skin, no dark patch from hair just below the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it&#x27;s painful in the beginning, but so is plucking youreye brows and waxing.  But you will get used to it.  I have only used it twice and already I can see the difference in reference to the pain factor.  I can tell that within a couple of more uses I probably won&#x27;t feel much at all.  I think the key thing to cut down on the pain would be to use it as soon as you have new hair growth even if just a few, don&#x27;t use it when your hair is too long that would hurt.  I give it four stars, and I didn&#x27;t feel any pinching on my skin as other people have written, the safety tip should protect your skin from pinching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My legs, underarms and bikini area have never been smoother.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, practical shape to hold, adapts to all body parts with ease. I like it much better than the ones with a wire that always gets in the way.&lt;br /&gt;The battery charge lasts really long, so you can use it during a long time before it needs to be recharged.&lt;br /&gt;The light is very useful to see even small or thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only minus is that the tweezers aren&#x27;t very accurate/fine, so you need to go many times over the same spot to get all hair.</li>
    <li> Remember way back in the 80s, that awful product called &amp;#34;Epilady&amp;#34; that was a rotating coil that attempted to rip out your leg hair and failed miserably? This is the evolved version, and this one actually works! It is basically many rotating little tweezers, that yank your hair out! Yes, you will whimper at first. But it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I got this about a year and a half ago, and liked it a lot (and would have given it 5 stars until now), and it worked perfectly (with average use of every 10-14 days or so.)  But then the last time I used it, I noticed it didn&#x27;t last as long as usual - it only worked for about 20 minutes, when usually it stays on for about 45 mins with a full charge.  I thought perhaps I hadn&#x27;t really fully charged it even though I was nearly positive I had, so I charged it fully again, and I just tried it again but this time even though the light was lit as solid green (indicating a full charge) it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on.  So it&#x27;s broken.  I thought a Braun would last me years and years, and I&#x27;m disappointed.  Not sure how to find out about exchanging it, either?</li>
    <li> I purchased this product two years ago and a few days ago it suddenly stopped working. Nothing happened it just doesn&#x27;t turn on. My previous Braun epilator lasted for 14 years and was still working when I decided to change it with a new one. The battery also functions poorly. It lasts for a short time and takes long to be fully charged. And the problem is that you can not use it while it&#x27;s charging. The cord should be unplugged before it starts working. So when the battery is dead, you should wait until the epilator is charged again.</li>
    <li> This review is for the: [[ASIN:B0077PLNB6 Braun Se7181 Silk-Epil 7181 Wet and Dry Epilator, Pink]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I approached using this with trepidation.  I remember the original epilators from the 1980&#x27;s &amp; they were painful!  This was really not too bad!  The key is to not let your hair get tooooo long.  You need a bit of stubble but if you go too long, it will hurt.  Also, use the 1 setting; it&#x27;s more gentle &amp; really does not hurt.  There is an occasional squint/pinch but it&#x27;s minimal in my experience.  Move very slowly.  It reminds me of changing from a regular toothbrush to an electric; you let the machine do the work &amp; move very slowly.  I think if you move quickly, you are probably just cutting off the top of the hair not actually tweezing it out.  You also need to rotate the direction for some hairs because it grows at different angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included in the box are \\&quot;soothing\\&quot; wipes.  They actually work.  You just wipe them on, wait 60 seconds &amp; then start using the epilator.  I tried cold turkey the first couple swipes with the epilator &amp; didn&#x27;t like the sensation so I tried the wipes.  I find I don&#x27;t need them anymore but it helped the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It works! It really made my legs feel smooth.  I&#x27;m new to the epilator so I still need to use it more frequently but as time goes by, I&#x27;m hoping to need it less often.  I&#x27;m 4 days out now &amp; have very little stubble.  I usually shave my legs every other day &amp; underarms, every day.&lt;br /&gt;-The vibrating/massage really does make it more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;-The light is really helpful for finding any stray hair you may missed.&lt;br /&gt;-I like that it can go in the shower &amp; can be rinsed with water.  This makes it easier to clean.&lt;br /&gt;-It works on underarms.  This was more painful than my legs but really not that bad.  I do not have the special attachment for underarms &amp; managed it just fine.&lt;br /&gt;-It took about 1 hour to fully charge.  It held its charge for both legs with charge to spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;My charger cord does not fit well in the socket of the epilator; it&#x27;s loose &amp; falls out if bumped slightly.  So I have to make sure it&#x27;s engaged.  I may just have a defective epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*******&lt;br /&gt;Update 6/5/2012:  I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month now.  There is really no pain when I use it on my legs.  Still a little twinge when I use it on my underarms but nothing extreme.  I find I need to use it less!  There are some hairs on my legs that grow back faster but now I just need to spot-use the epilator. And I can go @ 5 days now.  I really notice an improvement in my underarms - I used to shave them every day; now I epilate them every 5 days &amp; it looks so much more smooth compared to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6/2013:  Still using this &amp; still like it.r /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;My charger cord does not fit well in the socket of the epilator; it&#x27;s loose &amp; falls out if bumped slightly.

    <li> This is a great product.  It works exactly as described.  I have tried epilators before, with mixed success.  This is the best of the epilators that I have experience with.  Top of the line all the way.</li>
    <li> First, let me say epilators are not for everyone. However, these newer generation of epilators on the market today are so much better than epilators of the past but they still hurt a little (or a lot for people with a lower pain tolerance) since, unlike a standard electric razor, it pulls the hair from the root with a rotating motion and there&#x27;s definitely a bit of stinging. At first, you&#x27;ll have to epilate every few days because of hair growth irregularities. You&#x27;ll want to get all of the hair as it grows in and, over time, say two - three weeks, you&#x27;ll have substantial progress in mainting a smooth leg for longer periods of time. By smooth, I mean waxing smooth, it&#x27;s that good. And the process gets less painfull each time you epilate until you are accustomed to the feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set comes with the epilator, a recharger (and it holds the charge for an impressive amount of time), epilation caps, a cleaning brush, a pouch and a package of Oil of Olay pre-epilation wipes to use before epilating. I don&#x27;t know if the wipes are supposed to ease the stinging (because they really didn&#x27;t) but they still had a cooling, fragrant effect. This epilator is water safe and cordless so that you could use it in the shower for a wet shave but I have only used it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epilators are a great alternative to waxing and other expensive hair removal methods. And though the price may seem somewhat high, I think the value you&#x27;re getting is worth the price over time because it really works. And it&#x27;s very comfortable in hand. A great grooming tool and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I approached using this with much hesitation as I had a very negative experience in the past using an epilator.  I actually was quite surprised at the ease of using the Braun Silk-Epil 7181.  I just wanted it for my legs and so far this fits the bill without the pulling and burning sensation and followup rash that I experienced prior with a different brand.  The first time I used the Braun I was so hesitant, I didn&#x27;t hold it properly and did a real hit and miss job. The second time was much better and by the third attempt I was doing pretty good!  There was some mild discomfort the first couple of times, but not bad.  I didn&#x27;t find the enclosed wipes to be of much use.  That would be a personal preference.  I find this Braun to be quite effective and definitely a step up in the &#x27;ease of use&#x27; category for an epilator.</li>
    <li> A little discomfort for the first few minutes. After a well I got used to the feeling of the hair being pulled out. Every time I continue to use the product, I notice less discomfort. Less hair growth and the hair comes out easier. Very happy with this product</li>
    <li> Awesome product, does the job it promises, stylish design and holds a charge for longer than expected. Only wish you could use it while charging.</li>
    <li> It is a very good product. I recommend. And shipping is also good.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. It is a little bit of pain but way better than waxing. I simply love it. The best return for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> Before using this, I had never tried an epilator before. So needless to say, I was a little nervous when trying this for the first time. I chickened out a couple times before the epilator finally touched my leg and I&#x27;m not going to lie-if you&#x27;ve never experienced it before, it does hurt at first. It&#x27;s like a bunch of little pricks that had me saying \\&quot;Ouch!\\&quot;, \\&quot;Oh man\\&quot;, and \\&quot;You&#x27;ve got to be kidding me!\\&quot; but as I went on, it didn&#x27;t bother me as much. But after I was done, my legs felt so smooth and looked good that I (kinda) forgot the pain that it took to get there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Epilator comes with soothing wipes that you use before you use the epilator. I think that those really helped with not creating any irritation. In addition to the soothing wipes, after I used the epilator on my more sensitive areas, I immediately followed up with a hydrocortisone cream that helped with not getting itchy or any bumps. There is also a light on the devise that helps you see any stray hairs that maybe harder to see. I really liked that feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The epilator works much than shaving, in my opinion. My legs feel just as smooth as they would if I had shaved and they stay hair-free for a lot longer than with a shaver. I can go about two weeks when using the epilator. So yeah, it hurts a bit but I&#x27;d say the results makes the bit of pain well worth it.</li>
    <li> Well, I thought this would make my life easier but it has been a big mess!  The epilator is painful, but I could deal with that.  The real problem is the horrible ingrown hairs that happen.  My bikini line has been so horrible with bumps after using the epilator once.  Don&#x27;t buy this product is my advice, I wish I hadn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> ... I lied. There is still pain. I have been using a Braun Silk-Epil 5 (dry, corded model) for several years and while I had gotten used to using it on my legs, my underarms were still far too painful to be worth it for me. I had hoped that being able to use this in the bath after letting my pores open up in the steamy hot water that it would make the underarm process more tolerable. I really don&#x27;t notice a difference in pain, but I do like the cordless option. I do wish the battery lasted a little longer because I feel like I have to rush to get my legs done before the battery dies and if I feel brave enough to do my underarms, I have to wait for it to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the cordless and \\&quot;wet\\&quot; option, this model is almost identical to my previous cheaper model. It&#x27;s hard to say if the cordless option is worth the extra money, but I do prefer to go cordless. I just wish the warm water really helped to ease the pain so I could continue to epilate my underarms because despite the pain, there are bonuses to it. My skin is extremely sensitive and I ALWAYS get irritation under my arms when using a razor and I have to wait a day (optimally) to apply any kind of deodorant after shaving because I will get painful sores and rashes under my arms if I apply the deodorant right after shaving. When I epilate under my arms, I do not ever have this issue of irritation and inflammation. My previous Braun epilator came with a mitt and ice pack to \\&quot;numb\\&quot; the area before epilating and this did not help either and seemed to actually increase the pain because putting the ice on my skin stung like a mother.. Oh well, maybe someday someone will invent a pain-free epilator and become filthy rich! Until then, this will have to do. ;)</li>
    <li> Great product, works well in the shower or out.  Great price.  Would purchase again.  I had been using another one, but this is like going from cave man to the current century.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really painful to use, but I can handle pain. What I don&#x27;t like is that I paid a lot for it and it leaves stubbles!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. This epilator is very efficient and I don&#x27;t have to use it as often. The skin remains smooth for much longer and I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to keep it plugged all the time.</li>
    <li> It works. Packaging was great, color was great, everything was there, blah blah. BUT OH MY GOD, I DIDN&#x27;T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT. THE EPILATOR WAS INVENTED BY THE DEVIL. Who on this earth decided that it was a good idea to basically put a bagillion tweezers together into a small hand held device that goes round and round while plucking at your hairs at two speeds, FAST AND HOLY HELL FASTER. Oh that&#x27;s right, SATAN. There&#x27;s a first time for everything I guess. BYE FELICIA, I&#x27;ll stick to shaving and Nair...</li>
    <li> This is the first Epilator I&#x27;ve ever used, and it worked very well for the most part, but my leg hair is so fine that it had a hard time gripping and removing the hair.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product, and used it a number of times over the course of the first 4-6 weeks I owned it. Unfortunately on its last use, it randomly began to catch - quite painfully I might add - on my skin. Nothing about the way I was using it had changed.  Perhaps foolishly, I was determined to finish my legs, optimistically hoping the first catch was a fluke.  I proceeded even more carefully than before, however it didn&#x27;t stop.  The 4th catch hurt so much I yelped and dropped the thing, which landed on the bathroom floor and broke irreparably. I couldn&#x27;t believe that: a) it stopped working well so quickly, and b) was so cheaply made that the plastic pieces crumbled from a short fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m extremely disappointed at the waste of money for something that only worked for a month!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying-- I generally write positive reviews for products--so it&#x27;s rare for me to give an item a 1 star.  TRUST ME, one star is generous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried waxing, plucking, shaving, creams, etc and was really excited to learn about the epilator. I purchased mine a few weeks ago and have given it three honest attempts. Here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s PAINFUL. Even with the wipes, my legs were burning with pain&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s not quick.  It took me over an hour to get both of my legs&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s not efficient.  The machine missed a lot of hairs and I had to run it over certain areas of my legs 4-5 times&lt;br /&gt;4. My leg hairs grew back within three or four days.  All of the pain was pretty much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would not recommend this product to a friend and I wish I could take my product back to the store for a refund.</li>
    <li> excellent product, Love the light feature.</li>
    <li> Once I got used to the Plucking it&#x27;s not too painful but I feel like I spend a lot of time getting little accomplished.  I have to go over then same spot multiple times before it grabs anything.  Not that great of a device.  For the time I was spending doing this I was  hoping to be smooth but it takes forever and have to do it multiple times.</li>
    <li> This epilator is Ok but not better than the previous generation of braun. I paid 60 USD for the epilator I bought in 2006 and though braun 7181 is more expensive I do not see any differenece between them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators for about 6 years. I have used older Braun Silk Epil models and a Philips Satinelle Soft. Braun epilators are far superior in effectiveness and durability. The new model is better at pulling hairs first time, quieter and can be washed thoroughly after use. The light is quite good although not brilliant. The fact that it is cordless is a bonus but it is quite likely that you&#x27;ll run out of battery and have to recharge before continuing. I&#x27;ve not used it in the bath or shower just because it takes me too long to do my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Optional shaver head - I decided against getting the optional shaver head for the first time on buying a new epilator as they are never great quality and the foil always breaks way before the epilator part does (I use it every day for armpits). I opted for a men&#x27;s Philips Body Groom shaver with different attachments for hair length (for bikini) as I had been using my boyfriend&#x27;s after my epilator&#x27;s shaver head had broken. I found it very easy to use wet or dry and the foil felt much sturdier and hadn&#x27;t broken even after many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time epilator users - Yes, it hurts. It hurts a lot the first five times you use it (unless you&#x27;re a frequent waxer) until the roots are weaker. After that, you don&#x27;t feel the hairs come out at all. Keep up with it, if you can bear it, as it is so worth it in the long run. Even when your hairs do grow back, they&#x27;re not rough and spiky and it&#x27;s not itchy. Watch out for ingrowing hairs though, regularly use an exfoliating sponge. A tip is to not epilate during or a few days before or after your period as your skin is much more sensitive then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it was an excellent purchase and I know it will last for a long time and be worth the money.</li>
    <li> This thing really does its job. The first couple times you use it you are in extreme pain, but after a while you get used to it. It doesn&#x27;t work as well in the shower. I recommend using it on dry skin.</li>
    <li> The Braun silk epil is a decent product. It did what I wanted it to do, removing the hair it comes into contact with. However, it is not pleasant at all! A little advice, stick to the legs only! It feels like pulling off a scab really - a scab that covers your entire leg. But after a while, the pain gets a little better. The worst spots were beside my ankles, underarms, and bikini line. I will be using it for my LEGS ONLY for now on :) It is supposed to keep legs silky smooth for up to 19 days; they feel pretty smooth right now but a little bumpy because of the irritation, which is supposed to die down within 12 hours or so. I like the results and it&#x27;s more effective than shaving. Beauty is pain!</li>
    <li> Am amazed at the amount of of &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; that is removed even after having just shaved. Enjoy the ability to wash the head  under water as well as the fact you aren&#x27;t connect by a plugin..</li>
    <li> I really like this epilator, it&#x27;s the second one I&#x27;ve had in the past 5 years.  The other one worked okay (it was an Emjoi).  But I like this one better.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun epilator since 15 years. I pretty much liked the old model . Though the new model has its own benefits like its waterproof and you can use while sitting in bathtub, there is one ting which I dint like about it. Sometimes when you are running it, when the angle changes (like when it goes from arm to hand) it sucks the skin.I have hurt myself many times. You gotta be extra careful with it. I wud rather prefer switching back to the previous model whose design was much better than this one.</li>
    <li> I got this, feeling quite anxious about all pain hooha, every1 kept talking about! Ahhh, but I had an Ace up my sleeve- or so I thought! I was gonna numb my skin w/ SuperNumb, that I recommend when using my dermaroller, right? No. Wrong. As I said, it hurt like a Mother, but ya know, not intolerable or anything- I just wish I hadn&#x27;t got my hopes all up on SuperNumb being my saving grace...&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I started on my lower leg, just above my ankle. The SuperNumb was reserved for my more sensitive area- yes, the dreaded bikini line... So. I start. Hmmm? Not horrible. I&#x27;m encouraged! Both legs, one full week later, are soft as a baby&#x27;s butt, I&#x27;m happy to announce! And, btw, this series 7-7181 IS, in fact, for the legs, so if that&#x27;s the only place you plan on using it without too much suffering- it&#x27;s great! Look no further...&lt;br /&gt;When I got to the bikini area...HOLY HEdoubleL!! The gov should consider it 2 torture! Lol! Pretty rough- as in, painful. I&#x27;ve had 3 kids, I can handle it! However, my legs- a success! Oh! My underarms! Another success! Although the underarm area was, of course, more sensitive than the legs, but so far- not so much as a SINGLE stubble! Back to the torturous bikini area... I tried. I really did. And I&#x27;ll try again after a few drinks, or so! But the area is spotty, at best. Hit-and-miss, I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s still a few months til bathing suit time! I&#x27;ll try the sensitive area again, as I said, but for legs &amp; underarms, it&#x27;s 5 stars. And know, as I&#x27;m sure you do, by now- it hurts!</li>
    <li> I waxed for years, and truly, it is the best thing if you want a perfect result. However, I got tired of spending hundreds of dollars every month so I tried epilating instead. I tried a couple different epilators, and this is by far the best one, it is faster and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin like the other ones I tried. It isn&#x27;t as painful as waxing, if you don&#x27;t count bikini and under arm...I still wax in those areas as it is too painful to epilate there.</li>
    <li> I loved this Epliator.  The reason I gave this a 2 star is on bought this for around $100, and The problem I have is getting a replacement head.  I called the manufacturer BRAUN, and the representative I spoke with stated this replacement part is no longer made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO BE CAREFUL!! NO REPLACEMENT HEAD---NO LONGER AVAILABLE!!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I have to spend more $$ to get a new one, but this time I will defintely check and make sure I can get a replacement.</li>
    <li> I was not at all happy with the item :(</li>
    <li> This process hurt sooo bad! I am a habitual waxer so I&#x27;d like to think of my pain threshold being somewhat high. I also did my extended research on this product and those alike before venturing into the Epilator World. Not even the worst review could have prepared me for the horror that I endured.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up returning it.&lt;br /&gt;The experience:  I first tried the epilator 7 on a section of my arm, as it suggested. After a noisy but tolerable experience, the test section was indeed hair free. There was tolerable pinching during this process. I discovered that applying more pressure resulted in a smoother process. Upon completion of the test section, I then went in for the kill; the underarm. Although I had experienced a bit on my test area, the initial pinching was excessive and only became worse. At one point, a whole tuft of my skin was caught in the &amp;#34;pinchers&amp;#34; and, yes, there was blood. I stopped, assessed the situation, treated my wounds, and proceeded on the other side with more caution, giving the benefit of the doubt. But alas, the other side proved no better. With less blood this time, more hairs were left unplucked and with more nerves damaged.&lt;br /&gt;I believe I will be sticking with my waxing routine (and threading for the face).</li>
    <li> Being I&#x27;m not the professional swimmer type, I snagged the Braun Se7181 for someone of the fairer gender &#x3D; my wife. The Better Half had been complaining about uneven shaving performance for years, also the inability for even highest end ladies razors to get at knees and other less streamlined shaving surfaces. I thought I had a potential solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, let the record state that the end user of this was therefore female, the review obtained from her feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First things first and at a risk of stating the seemingly obvious (which wasn&#x27;t to me initially): an Epilator is NOT a shaver. You&#x27;ll still have to properly shave, prepare the surfaces prior to use. Meaning, the Se7181 is not a fast track to the absence of shaving. The Mrs. followed the Se7181 instructions to a tee: shaved, used appropriate preparation, dove headfirst into the Silk-Epil 7181 for Wet use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I consider the Better Half a tough woman; she&#x27;s feisty and has never complained about shaving and/or hair removal.  Upon first use of the Se7181, she emerged from the bathroom, however, with an angry glare, one which made me realize that are better Vine products to have your wife test out. Husbands of Amazon: you&#x27;ve been warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To explain, &#x27;it&#x27;s like getting stuck with endless needles, so painful I couldn&#x27;t finish the process,&#x27; she proclaimed. I asked her if she&#x27;d be willing to give it another shot, maybe it took some time (like acupuncture, for instance) to adjust to the sensation. The instruction manual makes a similar said claim. The angry glare deepened. &#x27;I&#x27;ll stick to shaving, it&#x27;s simply not worth it.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all fairness, however, the areas on her legs where she applied the Silk-Epil 7181 were noticeably and substantialy smoother versus shaving alone, perhaps the smoothest I&#x27;ve ever seen her legs, period. And - despite the torture device nature - it left no visible signs of wear or tear, no bumps, discolorations, or any sign of leg ginsu having occurred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, the pain reigned, but clearly the Silk-Epil 7181 (with the Mrs. in begrudging agreement) works. It does so, however, only for those willing to truly earn it.rred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, the pain reigned, but clearly the Silk-Epil 7181 (with the Mrs. in begrudging agreement) works.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been epilating for about ten years, with a Braun epilator I bought, well, about ten years ago. I have very sensitive skin and fast-growing hair, so shaving never really worked for me -- I&#x27;d get terrible razor burn almost every time I shaved, and my hair grew quickly enough that by the time the razor burn wasn&#x27;t hideously ugly, I had to shave again. So, ripping the hair out it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither my old Braun nor this will get legs as silky smooth as a good shave, since hair has to be above the surface in order to be grabbed by the tweezers. Epilating won&#x27;t save you any time, either, because the process itself is slower, though it doesn&#x27;t need to be done as often. That said, I think it&#x27;s well worth it, and this is a great little epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve considered getting a new epilator for a couple of years, and specifically considered a cordless wet/dry model because I&#x27;ve thought it might be more convenient to do it in the shower and have the hairs go down the drain rather than laying out a towel on the bathroom floor. I hesitated to purchase a cordless model, though, because I once had a cordless wet/dry trimmer that simply stopped holding a charge after a few months, and it couldn&#x27;t be used while plugged in. This also can&#x27;t be used while plugged in (for safety reasons), and it&#x27;s too soon to know how long the battery will last, but so far, I love it. I find myself picking up the epilator to do little touch ups in a way I never did with my old corded model. It is nice to be able to use it in the shower, but, honestly, it&#x27;s not that big an improvement, and because it is a slow process, it feels like a big waste of water. (It takes me about half an hour to do both legs fully if it&#x27;s been long enough that that&#x27;s necessary.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest improvement of this over my old epilator is the light, which I think is one of the best product innovations I&#x27;ve ever seen. I&#x27;m now much less likely to miss hairs on the backs of my legs, in the crook of my knee, etc. Because the light is forward of the head, you can&#x27;t see what hairs have been missed after each pass without going back over (which kind of makes me wish for two lights), but it almost always requires multiple passes anyway, so this is acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been epilating long enough that I don&#x27;t bother with the \\&quot;high frequency massage system\\&quot; cap, but when I tested it it seemed like it might provide slightly greater comfort at the expense of being even slower. If you&#x27;re just starting to epilate, I&#x27;d go with the advice I read years ago in a review for another product -- shave, epilate immediately after shaving, then do it again every day while the hair grows out. The volume will be low enough that it won&#x27;t hurt too much, and then by the time the second round of growth is beginning, it won&#x27;t be so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model appears to be identical to the 7681, but comes with fewer caps. I don&#x27;t epilate anything other than my legs, so this is definitely the model I&#x27;d choose, especially given the current price difference. If you want to epilate other parts of your body, this may not be the model for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend both the epilation method and this particular epilator. If the battery ever fails, I&#x27;ll update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(If there&#x27;s something else I could address to make this review more helpful, please leave a comment!

    <li> This was the first epilator I&#x27;ve used, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to other than shaving. That said, I&#x27;ve become a fan, and now prefer it over shaving for a lot of reasons. I decided to wait to review this until I&#x27;d used it a few times, because the reality is that it did hurt quite a bit the first time I used it (seriously. a lot.), and I needed to see if it was true that the pain would become less each time, and finally wouldn&#x27;t hurt much at all. Now that I&#x27;ve used it a few times (over a period of several weeks) I can attest to the fact that, yes, it doesn&#x27;t really hurt anymore. And I do really like this method of removing leg hair because it makes my legs pretty smooth for a week or so with no extra maintenance. Here&#x27;s the sum-up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Hair doesn&#x27;t grow back for several days (at least) &#x3D; less stubble, less time overall.&lt;br /&gt;-The attached light makes it easier to see hairs to make sure you remove it all.&lt;br /&gt;-If you have a scratch or bug bite you can run it over it without a problem (I did, anyway).&lt;br /&gt;-After a couple uses, it is basically pain-free.&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to clean (a tiny brush is included for this purpose).&lt;br /&gt;-Rechargeable battery, pretty long charge.&lt;br /&gt;-Can be done in the shower, or on dry legs; so you don&#x27;t need extra lotions or creams and can do it anytime, anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Hurts like crazy the first time if you&#x27;ve never epilated before.&lt;br /&gt;-Can leave red bumps the first time (which go away within a day).&lt;br /&gt;-You often have to go over the same spot several times at different angles to get all the hairs (though since it takes so much longer for the hairs to grow back, I still think you end up saving time vs. shaving).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a quality product and does its job well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s painful. There&#x27;s no getting around it; if you&#x27;re going to be ripping hairs out by the root it&#x27;s going to hurt. It is much more effective and long lasting than using a razor however, which is why I use it. The first one I bought stopped working 2 1/2 years after I bought it which was right after the warranty expired so I suspect planned obsolescence. It works well enough that I bought the same one again and I&#x27;m hoping that this time it lasts longer.</li>
    <li> It took me a while after receiving this product to work up the courage to try it. The only method of hair removal I&#x27;ve ever tried is waxing so I&#x27;m used to a certain level of pain but some of these reviews scared me. My personal experience wasn&#x27;t as painful as I thought it would be but still, it did HURT. I felt that the product itself is well made and is pretty effective but after a little while, the pain in my lower legs was too much for me to continue. In fairness, I haven&#x27;t used any other epilators so I can&#x27;t compare the experience with this product to any others. The problem is that people have different thresholds for pain so this could work better for others than it did for me.</li>
    <li> Works great, smooth skin, no pain!</li>
    <li> I looked at all the various epillators here on Amazon, reading the reviews.  I&#x27;ve never owned one, but&lt;br /&gt;this past summer, I saw that my daughter, while visiting, was using one.  I was a bit fearful of&lt;br /&gt;pain, but using this model is really okay!  Not so much painful.  I do find I have to pass over&lt;br /&gt;areas repeatedly to get all the hair, but that is okay!  I like this machine, and I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I have read more of the reviews on here because I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work on facial hair.  I see&lt;br /&gt;than it CAN be used for the face, with the other attachment.  I&#x27;ll report back when I get the nerve to try&lt;br /&gt;this!</li>
    <li> Ouch!! It pinched and scratched my skin!</li>
    <li> For those looking for an efficient way to remove hair, look no further. I have been using depilating machines for 10 years now, and this machine is amazing. It removes the hair fast and I feel no pain at all ( I have been doing this for a long time, if its your first time, it will hurt a bit). It is easy to clean and to store, since it has its one bag.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife and she loved it. It is a great product and worth the value.</li>
    <li> Perfect...perfect....the best I ever had! a bit expensive but it is worthed! I recommend this item....especially if you use it in the shower</li>
    <li> Wife loves it. She only has to use every four weeks. Great alternative to having to shave every three days. Can use in the shower or not.</li>
    <li> This is my second Epilator from Braun. My first one was a cheaper model that had to be plugged in to be used. Not having to be restricted to a plug in is great and this seems to charge quickly.</li>
    <li> Horribly painful... Gets stuck and pulls hairs slowly.</li>
    <li> My wife likes this and gives it a 4. She says you have to get used to it but it works. I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s entirely impressed with the whole \\&quot;yank the hair off your legs\\&quot; thing but given what razors cost she&#x27;s willing to stick with it. She didn&#x27;t have any problem with rashes or any other issues. So I guess it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> First of all I have very dark coarse hair and I AM sensitive to pain.I like home waxing but don&#x27;t like the time in between waiting for hair to grow long enough to wax again. The epilator took care of all these problems. As far as pain goes, trust me...its almost NOTHING. It comes closest to maybe a mild pinch pr even less. The little rollers &amp;#34;massagers&amp;#34; sensation help distract from the little bit of pain when you pull hair. The light is Awesome, as I run the epilator along my skin the light shows hairs that I didn&#x27;t see before that I can be sure get pulled. Some people complained about the cord unplugging too easily which happens when it is not plugged in to the end of the epilator completely. The cord has a very tight fit and clicks into place which also makes it harder to pull out but not over difficult. I only have to use it about once a week to maintain. I Strongly urge you to wax what ever areas you want hair free the first time and then just do maintenance once a week. I have also used it in super sensitive areas and have found it annoyingly painful and not tearfully painful. Totally worth it if you HATE shaving</li>
    <li> It was everything I expected it to be. I used it on my whole arms and legs with ease. I am a very hairy person but it didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought it would. My arms and legs are smooth as silk now ! The great thing about this is also that you can go over old spots that you thought you plucked out but didn&#x27;t. Love it ! This will change the way I get rid of my hair forever.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I realized this was the &amp;#34;legs&amp;#34; version until I received the package. I bought it for the price thinking I was getting a deal on the Legs &amp; Body version. With the Legs version, you do not receive the additional heads to epilate face and underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the actual product: The Braun epilator works pretty much exactly as I had anticipated. It pulls the hair out from the root (most of the time) so it is painful. I have epilated my legs, underarms and have ventured to do my bikini line but haven&#x27;t quite built up the courage to do a full brazilian. It is especially painful in the more sensitive areas of the underarms and bikini region! I am hoping that over time, my hair will become finer and easier to epilate because right now there is a lot of teeth grinding and swearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find epilating in the shower to be a distraction from the pain but the light isn&#x27;t very good and I can&#x27;t quite get the right angles to epilate everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it may be very difficult (painful) to epilate slowly, the Braun does a much better job if you stretch the skin and move slowly over it. If you do short, knee-jerk motions with it (sometimes you just can&#x27;t help it), you are more likely to break the hair rather than pull it from the root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure what to do to prevent against ingrown hairs. I exfoliate several hours after I epilate and still have the ingrowns. I am hoping that with more epilating and exfoliating, it will stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I have the money, I will likely go the laser hair removal route, but until then, I will keep up with the epilating.</li>
    <li> I have had this Epilator for two years now. I like to wait on reviews for a while when dealing with electronic items...because you just never know. So far so good. This epilator is not perfect but works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cordless/rechargeable&lt;br /&gt;Wed/dry Epilator&lt;br /&gt;Has two power settings&lt;br /&gt;Seems to go for a long time on each charge&lt;br /&gt;Love the light it has to locate the hairs to pull out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t always get the finer/lighter colored hairs&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why but sometimes it grabs my skin (especially in the underarm area)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great epilator. I hope that it lasts for a long time!</li>
    <li> Totally awesomely excellent.</li>
    <li> I love this epilator.  As the bearded lady I can tell you this works fantastically.  This first time I used it, I saw no hair for 3 days, now it lasts a week at least.  Besides using it for my beard I also used it in the shower and it worked very well and it lasts a long time.  I know many reviews said that it was painful but for a woman who has plucked, bleached, used stinky hair remover and finally started shaving, I didn&#x27;t feel it was painful to such an extent but everyone&#x27;s pain tolerance is different.  I probably should have gotten the next one in the Braun series because I believe it had a facial hair attachment but this is working and I will continue to use.  I started out with a Phillips silk epilator but the first time I used, it didn&#x27;t work very well and immediately a piece fell out of it.  Maybe I just got the bad one.  I returned it to Amazon to get a refund.</li>
    <li> Super easy to use and much better than shaving. Plus you can use it in the shower which is very convenient.</li>
    <li> Love it!  The only thing I can say bad about it is that it does seem to break down after a couple of years and you cannot buy just the parts to replace.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this wet yet but it works well dry, and you do get used to the pain...after a few uses.</li>
    <li> I have used older Braun model and decided to upgrade to this one, cordless is a very appealing option to have. At this point doing my legs is a breeze, I barely feel it. Armpits is another story, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> The one i had was braun ,and it was over 10 years old the thing that connected to the cable became loose,so i t decid to go for a new one,after couple of research o came accross this one and am glad i did.&lt;br /&gt;very effective and i will recommend it</li>
    <li> Highly recommend Braun Silk-Epil 7181 wet and dry epilator. It has a smooth mechanism which is very effective. Easy to maneuver and I specially like the fact that it can be used on wet or dry skin. Appears durable.</li>
    <li> Not nearly as painful as on the ones in the 80&#x27;s. I&#x27;m an believer in these now, I don&#x27;t have to shave every day now. Yes, painful (not nearly as bad as I thought, but others wills disagree lol).</li>
    <li> much faster than the cheaper one I had first bought.  does legs &amp; chin very well.  Underarm is always tricky to get the angle right, but it does ok (again, much better than the cheaper one I&#x27;d first tried).</li>
    <li> This is the best Epilator compare to other epilators. The fact that you can use it wet &amp; dry is a definite plus. It is painful if you have never used an epilator before, but try using it in the shower with soap, and your experience would be much less painful. Definitely prefer it to waxing. I just wish i had known about it years ago.</li>
    <li> This is the worst epilator ever! For 10 min. it works fine, after that it has no power to do the job. Also, as head is made of metal it catches skin all the time.</li>
    <li> I had high expectation on this product because I had heard and read that it would be really good. Sure, it is good. The light is good and the fact that you can use  it in the water is very practical but I do not think that this epilator is better than the last epilator I had, Philips satin. Okey it is less painful because you can have it in the water but I think it is less effevtive than my previous philips, it is difficult to remove all hair. And it makes alot of noice as well.</li>
    <li> Works well, but save money and get the silk epil 5 or 3.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars +++++ for braun epilators, 3 for this particular unit compared to the older models.&lt;br /&gt;The wet feature is absoulutely useless, and because of it the unit will not work if it is plugged in. That means that if you forgot to recharge you have to wait till it charges before you can use it. I imagine the unit will get about a year of use before the rechargeable batteries do not keep the charge and you will have to buy a new one! Unless you use it where ther is no electricity the battery operation is more of a con than a plus! The head is much smaller that the older units, so it takes WAY longer to do the job. The (not bad at all) pain is the same for all models, the new technology is just a sales gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that every Braun epilator I have used did its job, so I will buy another one when this one dies. The pain is minimal and gets better as you use it REGULARLY! Do not let the hair fully grow back, tat is the trick! The only other brand/type I have ever used was the original epilady, and it worked but was painful!!! I considered buying a different brand but after reading various reviews I decided to stick with the silk epils, and I am happy.</li>
    <li> I owned an early model Epilady many many years ago, and my friend and I always joked that \\&quot;Epilady\\&quot; should be pronounced with a built-in scream.  I spent the subsequent years waxing my legs, instead, with only an occasional scream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was eager (and fearful) to try the new improved model.  What can I say?  It is truly new and improved.  I&#x27;m not sure if my years of waxing numbed me, but, for use on legs, this baby is pretty painless and extremely effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge lasts a long time, it does an excellent job, the hairs don&#x27;t grow in all stubble-y, and it&#x27;s great for quick touch-ups.  It says it can be used wet or dry.  I kind of thought wet and electricity sounded like a bad combo, so I didn&#x27;t go there.  And I don&#x27;t recommend it for underarm use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for legs... perfect.  I love mine, and the only screams are reminsicent of the model of days gone by.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. Works well and stays close to skin picking up all the smaller finer hairs too without much discomfort at all. Easy to use in the shower and this makes it less time consuming!</li>
    <li> This is just a waste of money. And painful. I&#x27;m a seasoned epilator (15+ years). This stupid thing just HURTS. It rotates too slowly and is excrutiating. It also doesn&#x27;t have as many tweazers as an Epilady Legend. The Epilady Legend is fast and efficient. I recommend it 100% over this ridiculous epilator. It didn&#x27;t pull all the hairs after 10 or more painful passes. I quickly went back to the Epilady after buying this. The Epilady doesn&#x27;t hurt as badly as this thing does.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! So easy to use, it grasp all the hair. Love the light, it really helps.</li>
    <li> The product itself worked fine. However, I was not prepared for the amount of pain this caused. I may have a low pain tolerance, but be ware that it is painful. Other than the pain, it worked great and te results were good.</li>
    <li> Why did you choose this rating?&lt;br /&gt;R / I chose this rate because I successfully fulfilled Supplier&lt;br /&gt;What do you like or dislike?&lt;br /&gt;R / So far I&#x27;ve enjoyed buying the product, I had no problem&lt;br /&gt;Who would you recommend this product?&lt;br /&gt;R / I&#x27;ve recommended it to friends and family</li>
    <li> This product is not only painful, but I went up and down my leg many times and still it seemed to do very little.  Use a razor.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because, it is really fast and perfect, but at the beginning it hurted a little bit but then it went really easy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for more than 7 months now and I regret buying it for a main reason that I wasn&#x27;t actually aware of and wasn&#x27;t so clear when I decided to buy the product.&lt;br /&gt;That reason is that this epiletor doesn&#x27;t work while it is plugged in, and by time as I am using it now for quite a long time the battery proofed that it can&#x27;t last for very long time. When I first bought it it was working okay but by time the battery became bad and doesn&#x27;t last enough to finish one leg.&lt;br /&gt;This product it designed for women who remove hair every week. But that is not the case here with me because the more often we remove the hair the faster it will grow again. I hoped this product would work while it is plugged in also.&lt;br /&gt;Now it takes me sometimes 5 to 6 hours to remove hair because I have to remove an area then battery will die then I have to charge it and it takes like 45 mins to recharge then to use it again. It is so painful and I am thinking now to buy another brand that doesn&#x27;t have this disadvantage. I am really so disappointed with this version because my last Braun lasted like more than 9 years and still it is working very good but I can&#x27;t use it because it is not compatible with the american electricity voltage so I had to buy this Braun Silk Epile 7 Wet and Dry thinking that it will be as good as by previous one, but I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;So be careful when buying this product and think about your needs and consider the battery&#x27;s life and according to that buy it or not.</li>
    <li> Yes, so thing is somewhat painful, but did you think ripping out several hairs at a time from their root wouldn&#x27;t be? After the first to times, the pain seems minimal though...so just stick with it. Wonderful quality, I am sure this one will last me quite a long time.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I have waxed my legs many times, so the pain of using an epilator did not bother me.&lt;br /&gt;However, this product was awful. First, the description clearly stated that this item could be used on the underarms with an attachment. When I received the product, the pamphlet says you should NEVER use this product under the arms. Fail number one.&lt;br /&gt;Next, when I actually used the product, it was useless. The bottom portion of my legs have thick coarse hair. The epilator would brush over the hair, pull it, and break it off. I tried again and again and again, both with dry skin and wet skin, to see if it had to do with the angle I was holding the machine. Nope, this continued to break off the hair. The worst part is that the hair didn&#x27;t break off at the end or keep the hair fairly long. The hair broke off right at my skin, which also made it impossible to shave the hair off without waiting a few days.&lt;br /&gt;In another attempt to redeem this product, I used it on the upper part of my legs which only have peach fuzz. Not only did this item not pick up any hair at all, it pinched my skin and caused bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT ever recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews before buy this item. Finally I received my Braun last week .... what a bad day, it&#x27;s not work .... It is horrible, I used one time and other and other, and does not work for me. MAybe my hair is not thick enough I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> The Braun Silk Epi 7181wet Dry Epilator is one of the better epilators on the market.  We compared this to a corded Braun Epilator along with an older Philips cordless Epilator.  This Braun cordless proved to be a lot less painful and took a lot less time than either of the other two models we own.  The results were very smooth skin that was a bit smoother than even the corded model we own.  Overall this is an excellent  choice for anyone  who uses an epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Positive Points Include: ***&lt;br /&gt;- Very comfortable and fast epilation&lt;br /&gt;- Long lasting charge (can last almost an hour)&lt;br /&gt;- Relatively fast recharge time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Negative Points Include::***&lt;br /&gt;- Poor performance when the battery is low.</li>
    <li> This is my second epilator.  My first was braun silk epil xelle. I used that one until it started shorting out and bought this one.  I chose a braun because I liked my previous one so much.&lt;br /&gt;I am very familiar with epilating. I know that you need to exfoliate every day, do it on clean skin etc.  I do all of those things.  This one just really sucks at grabbing hair.  I have been epilating with this every day and have yet to have achieved smooth legs. I have never really had ingrown hairs. With this one, I have so many I can&#x27;t believe it. It really chops off more hair than it pulls out. Thin fine hair is the worst.&lt;br /&gt;This morning I got so frustrated that I plugged in my old dying epilator.  20 mins later, minus the ingrown hairs, I was hair free.  this was after trying to achieve the same results for an hour with this machine.&lt;br /&gt;I can not say enough bad things about this epilator. It doesn&#x27;t even achieve epilation. This is one purchase I am very sorry to have made.</li>
    <li> This was my first epilator, and I think it worked relatively well, at first. Only a few months after use (no more than 3) the battery stopped holding a charge. The indicator light goes red almost immediately, despite hours of charging. I will be sending it in for repair, but I&#x27;m disappointed I even have to so early. This makes me doubt the quality of this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a painful epilator - but I was a newbie, so take that into account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update 12/9/2012***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent this in October 2012 for repair, and have only gotten a letter in the mail verifying a work order for repair. Very disappointed with the amount of time it is taking.</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of epilators, most recently the Emjoi AP-18, which is one of their most expensive models and nowhere as good as this one.  Having been very disappointed by that model, which is meant to be one of the best, I was leery of spending good money on another expensive epilator that too might be junk.  This model is far superior, much to my relief.  I am not one for attachments, so I can&#x27;t comment on that, but I find this model is better than most in terms of pulling (and not breaking) hair and not having to go over an area too many times.  Unlike the Emjoi, the head swivels making knee caps, arm pits, etc. much easier to epilate.  The light is a big help too, especially if you have fine or fair hair like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find it works well on wet skin, so I wouldn&#x27;t buy a wet/dry one again.  Others have mentioned that too I notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, having tried a multitude of them over the years, I am happy with this one.  As other have said, I think the models a decade ago that were basic were better at doing the job, but considering what is on the market at the moment, I think this is as good as it gets.</li>
    <li> I must have read reviews for 40 products and visited 3 websites over two weeks before finally picking this product:  The Braun Silk-Epil 7181 Epilator.  I ordered this yesterday morning, and had it in my hot little hands by 6:00.  I love Amazon Prime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a epilation virgin, as well as many of the reviewers that I see on Amazon.  I expected to be howling in the bathroom and warned my boyfriend to not worry if he hears swearing or whimpering.  So I decided to start with the most sensitive part first - My underarms.  I shaved the day before and cleaned my underarms (about 2-3 mm hair growth at time of epilation) about 1/2 hour before I wanted to start last night.  Yes, that HURT. I found that if I took a DEEP breath and held it while looking in the mirror the pain was less - just endurable.  I managed to get the left underarm done in about 3 breaths and the right one in only two.  My underarms did get really red and looked amazingly sore.  Where the hair was pulled out, I did bleed a little in a few spots.  So I washed them gently and put on some lotion.  No deodorant or antiperspirant.  Phew.  Done.  Scored major points with the boyfriend as he was very impressed.  This little device sort of scares him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the legs.  My hair grows somewhat slowly on my legs so I shaved 2 days before to give it a chance to grow out some.  I had about 1-2 mm growth. I started on my right leg and whee!  It really only hurt a little.  I had it on slow speed at first with the cute little roller head with the beads, and away I went.  This was a piece of cake after my underarms!  The first leg was done in just 15 minutes.  I ended up switching to the efficiency Cap and the higher speed at some point...  Easy.  Both legs done in just 30 minutes.  This hurt only a little bit and the more painful parts were the backs of my thighs and backs on my calves.  My legs did get all sorts of little red bumps where the hair came out, but a little lotion seemed to calm them down a little and I went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****&lt;br /&gt;The morning after:  Legs are smooth and the skin is totally calm.  I still feel some really small stubble on my lower legs, I suspect that either the hair was broken off instead of pulled, or maybe those hairs were lot long enough to get pulled out.  My underarms are still sensitive and still have little red dots, but they have NO HAIR AT ALL.  None.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I really like this product.  It works as expected and as advertised.  The pain was a lot less then I thought it would be.  5 stars for now, but I thought about giving it 4 stars because of the leg hair thing.  I will follow up and let you all know if the hair on my legs is getting pulled out or broken off - I want it pulled out, not broken off.  And if I can get the nerve up, I may try the hair on my face...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****&lt;br /&gt;12/1/2012 I have been using this for a few months now and here is my update:  I dropped the rating down to 3 stars.  It is definitely breaking the hair off and not pulling it out at the root.  Seems that the hair in my underarms is actually getting pulled out because it is thicker - and as a result of the hair getting pulled out it is growing in more sparse.  This is exactly what I was hoping for... love it!  However, the hair on my legs and face is just getting broken off.  I have a feeling the hair is a little too fine to be pulled effectively - maybe the little tweezers are moving too fast and just breaking the hair before it has a chance to pull it out?  anyway, I&#x27;m trying to decide if I want to try a different brand or try the No No instead.wn a little and I went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****&lt;br /&gt;The morning after:  Legs are smooth and the skin is totally calm.  I still feel some really small stubble on my lower legs, I suspect that either the hair was broken off instead of pulled, or maybe those hairs were lot long enough to get pulled out.

    <li> I picked 4 stars because after I was done using it, my legs would be red and when the hair started to grow back, I would get ingrown hair. But other than that it was really good removing hair.</li>
    <li> I bought mine at Target, but only because I didn&#x27;t want to wait. I have had NO issues with mine. I&#x27;ve used it on my legs, arms and armpits, even the top of my girlie parts. It&#x27;s not as bad as some make it out to be. I had one of the first eiplators that came out in the 80&#x27;s... Now that one sucked! I&#x27;ve been using mine for a month now and my skin has never been softer! No more ouchies or dry skin from shaving. No more ingrown hairs.... Amazing product!!!</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed with this product. I always trusted Braun Epilators, therefore I bought this upgraded one in July 2013, and I always took care of it, cleaned it after I used it each time, and when it says it is waterproof or can be used under water, I didn&#x27;t try that even, and now it is always out of charge, even when I charged for a whole day, when it used to take less than an hour to recharge. I don&#x27;t know what happen, but I expected more since I took real good care of it, and I only used it on my legs and arms.</li>
    <li> Once you use this epilator a few times it is almost pain free (on legs and armpits).  I still don&#x27;t enjoy using it on my upper lip but it beats the heck out of waxing ANY day.  I have the corded model also and prefer this one.  It seems to spin a little faster and work a little better.  This cordless one is also so much handier.  I find I use it more frequently because I can just grab it, do a quick touch up, run it through hot water, give it a little scrub, leave it to dry and back in the drawer it goes.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this thing. I normally wax but this just seemed like it would be faster and more convenient since it could be used in the shower.  Not the case at all. It took longer than waxing since you have to make several passes over one area. It wasn&#x27;t very painful, just slightly uncomfortable. Unfortunately though, I ended up with horrible painful ingrown hairs. I exfoliated before using this and did everything I was suppose to do.</li>
    <li> works well, especially on wet skin. Needs to come with a bikini adapter to make the process a bit less intense.</li>
    <li> It work ok I like it&lt;br /&gt;Good to shape&lt;br /&gt;It perfect&lt;br /&gt;I feel so exciting&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much&lt;br /&gt;Kiss</li>
    <li> Ok, so this is my first epilator.  I knew that it would hurt, I mean, duh, you are ripping your hair out by the root.  As a quick back story, I cannot stand the feeling of hair on my legs, so I have been shaving daily for as long as I can remember.  I wanted a longer term hair removal solution as I have two young boys, and my alone time is nearly non-existant.  I bought a home laser hair remover, but I have mostly blonde hair on my legs, so the laser recommended epilating prior to the laser treatment.  That is where my story begins...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was getting all sweaty and nervous to try this thing, so I positioned myself under a fan and took a deep breath.  The very first pass I did wasn&#x27;t THAT bad.  I kind of giggled at myself about what I big deal I had made out of it.  The best comparision that I can come up with is that it is like getting a tattoo; that slow, sharp, dragging feeling.  So, I epilated one strip of my calf, then decided that I would go to town when the boys went down for a nap.  That one strip stung a bit afterward, but no big deal.  I was chomping at the bit to do more because I was impressed with how smooth that strip was, so I put a movie on for the boys and started going nuts.  Let me tell you, that first strip was a tease.  After you really get going it hurts!!!  And I know I have a high pain tolerance; I&#x27;ve sat through 5 hour tattoos without any problems, birthed two babies, not really a whiny type girl.  But man, this !@#$%^&amp; HURT!  My boys were laughing at me because I was talking outloud, with my leg on the coffee table, saying, &amp;#34;why do I keep doing this to myself?!?!  What haven&#x27;t I stopped yet?!?!  Why does this hurt so bad?!?!  This is NOT like petting puppies as I had hoped!!!&amp;#34;  Anyway, after what seems like a sweaty eternity, I was done, and my legs were incredibly smooth!!!  Granted, they were COVERED in red bumps and irritations, but soooo smooth!!!  I did have to go over some spots (my knees, calves, side of my thighs) multiple times because the hair grows in all different directions.  I completed my first run with the epilator on low, and using the gaurd with the skin massagers.  Again so someone who normally shaves every single day, I was elated to have smooth legs for several days!  In fact, I finally started to get stubble about 4 days later, but not even enough to shave until about 6 days later!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m pretty certian that it is impossible to get every single hair, I mean, how often do you miss a spot when shaving?  I did have to do some &amp;#34;touch ups&amp;#34; about two days after my initial epilation because there where single hairs that I missed that were bugging me.  I almost feel like I&#x27;m becomign addicted to epilating because everytime I feel a little stubble, I bust it out and epilate!  As many other reviewers mentioned, that first run was the worst because there was so much hair.  When I do the touch ups, it&#x27;s not as bad (though, my last touch up was behind my knee, which HURTS, and I had to pep talk myself, &amp;#34;Come on!  Don&#x27;t be a wuss!  Just do it!!!&amp;#34;, to get through).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, I am also using the home laser, so I imagine that is helping to deter the hair growth as well, but I&#x27;d say that the pain is most definately worth the gain!  I&#x27;m so, so very happy that I bought this product!</li>
    <li> Where have you been all my life?  I love this thing.  Best purchase all year.  Easy to use and easy to clean.  Can use on very very short hair.  Im very hairy. After shaving my legs i will have stuble within the hour.  With the braun, after i shave i have smooth legs all day and the next day.  Until i can afford laser on my legs this is the next best option.  I use to wax and it was such a horrible time consuming mess.</li>
    <li> This epilator has loads of features which seem really nice, but there&#x27;s a problem. If you have thicker/coarser hair -- women with PCOS, women of certain ethnicities, and so on -- you are going to find that some of the features actually work against you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main one is the battery-only operation. I have quite troublesome hair that is sadly not as thin as many women&#x27;s, and 40 minutes is about the MINIMUM amount of time required to do my legs. As a result, this epilator just doesn&#x27;t work for me, because that&#x27;s all the charge it can hold, and you can&#x27;t use it with it plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really too bad, because everything else about it is superior to their other models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this doesn&#x27;t detract from the product because you can just not use it this way, but i feel like it&#x27;s worth pointing out that wet hair is structurally weaker than dry hair -- depending on your hair type, trying to use this in the shower is very likely to lead to breakage instead of actual tweezing. If you find yourself coming out with lots of stubble, you should switch to doing it dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an epilator before, but was pleasantly surprised with this.  It&#x27;s very easy to use, and a couple sprays of Bactine Pain Relief spray keeps it from being too painful.  I used it for the first time over a week ago and the hair is just barely starting to come back.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s new to epilation.</li>
    <li> Silk Epil is great, saves money by not having to buy razors and shaving cream, hair grows back softer. Only have to use the silk epil once a month compared to shaving once a week.</li>
    <li> This is my third epilator and the best so far. There is absolutely no pain when using it (it is going to be different for first time users - it hurts a lot when you use an epilator for the first time). The light is a great feature - you can see every single hair when depilating. I love the cordless feature as well. The design is lovely as well.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve had it for a month and don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about the product yet. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am very very please with how quickly I can finish up with epilating my underarms and legs. I previously bought two other epilators the emjoy  brand and they both fall way behind to this one. One of the emjoy i had was the 72 tweezes one and I thought it was the best until after using for only 6 month it stopped working so i got this one. I was very upset at fist that i had spend another 70 dollars but this epilator works so well that I&#x27;m almost glad that the other one crashed after such a short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with two attachments but i have never felt the need to change the heads cause the one it came with does a nice job of lifting the hair. I think this is partly why the hair is removed so quickly and thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first i thought that i should&#x27;ve bought the more expensive one that comes with even more attachments but if you don&#x27;t need the shaving head then you don&#x27;t need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of all it&#x27;s not as painful at all. I wish that I had chosen this one when i first started using an epilator.</li>
    <li> This item works great!  You have to be cautious and read the intructions, but it does a great job!  SS</li>
    <li> My wife just love it. Best thing I ever bought to her.</li>
    <li> like the light and cordless.  Works very well.</li>
    <li> This hurts and dies before you can even finish your thigh. It hurts WAY too much for armpits, bikini areas, or anywhere else sensitive. It hurts. Period.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I could tough it out, so I threw out the box. Now it just sits in the drawer.</li>
    <li> Easy to operate ... great results !!!</li>
    <li> I love that it pulls the whole hair root out, just like waxing but without all the mess. AWESOME! AWESOME!!!</li>
    <li> Very painful for first time users (like me). It does quite a nice job, though.. I didn&#x27;t have to shave for a couple of weeks!</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd Braun Silk Epil I&#x27;ve owned.  They are pricey,  they work really well, but they only last about 3 years, and more expensive to repair than to buy a new one.</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator, I find it very easy to use. Once I got over the noise, I found it did not hurt as I thought it would. My legs feel smooth for about a week or two until small hairs start growing back. So it doesn&#x27;t last as long as waxing but it is saving me money. I don&#x27;t have to go to the salon. It doesn&#x27;t take long, I just sit down and run it over my legs for 20-30 minutes.</li>
    <li> I have had this item for about three years now.  I bought it with the intention of using it for my legs and underarms. I tried using it on my legs a few times, but the pain wasn&#x27;t worth it to me. My leg hair is only dark around the knees anyway, so I wasn&#x27;t concerned. I do, however, use this regularly for my underarm hair.  It hurts just as much as it hurt on my legs, but nothing compares to not having to worry about stubble there --however -- it&#x27;s not perfect.  I like it, I don&#x27;t love it. It&#x27;s still better than shaving but it has its drawbacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to use this about 2 to 3 times a week (which is obviously less often than shaving, but still more than I had imagined I&#x27;d have to use it). I do get regrowth between uses but it&#x27;s only partial, and keeping up with it every few days makes this easier to use as it&#x27;s pulling less hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do get a lot of hair breakage, which is why I think I have to use this so often. I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a way around this or if it&#x27;s normal. This is the most frustrating part because if the hairs breaking then it grows back just as if I had shaved (boo, stubble).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still get in-grown&#x27;s occasionally. No more or less than I did when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About once a month I will shave because, well, it&#x27;s easier, but also because I feel like this gives the hair a chance to &amp;#34;reset&amp;#34; and I feel like I get a better result when I switch back to this.</li>
    <li> This is so much more painful than waxing!! It didn&#x27;t pluck out most of the hairs, it broke them at the surface, and now I&#x27;ve got ingrown hairs like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. It&#x27;s terrible! I&#x27;m going to stick with waxing.</li>
    <li> I bought this epilator for my legs. I wont lie and it is painful unless you are someone who can withstand any amount of pain.. I had to go over the same area 3 to 4 times to be hair-free... i would prefer waxing anyday better than an epilator. Its a personal choice though. So if you can withstand pain you can buy it...</li>
    <li> I decided to try the legs and in the shower..and crikey, there is a little sting to it.  I think I prefer waxing, but maybe I need to get use to this little twang.  it helps if you warm your legs sufficiently before hand, which I tried after the first buzz!  i am not brave enough to try it on other more sensitive areas!  I will give this another go on the legs as this does keep the daily shaving down and hair less course.  Sorry, it is a pain contraption if you dont apply it correctly, and you do need some trial and errors to make it as comfortable as you can.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. A good product that does the job. Fast. Convenient to use. Arrived super fast. I read some reviews where people are complaining that it is painful to use. well... the first times when you start using epilators... are always painful. But it gets much better. I hardly felt aything with this product compared to older models.</li>
    <li> the epilator itself works very well. I was an epilator virgin. i got it 2 months ago and used it since. it removes fine and thick hair effectively. the pain for me was very minor except bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT... I noticed i was getting so many ingrown hair on my legs and bikini area. I&#x27;ve never had ingrown hair in my life and now my skin is full of red bumps which is very irritation and painful. I&#x27;ve been shaving for 10 years my life never got any ingrown and now suffering from lots and lots of them because of this epilator. I HATE IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> i love it!! takes some practice if your new to this. but better than a scary razor that can cut you. It did kind of bite my skin when it ran out of power. so keep the time in mind when you use it. make sure to fully charge it before you use it. only 4 stars because the tweezer head broke when i dropped it without the cap. so be careful.</li>
    <li> I have being always a fan of Braun Silk Epil since I was 16, I bought my first braun when I was 18 and it lasted me 10 years yes 10 years but this one it lasted me one year and one month . I bought it from Amazon  and after one and a month the battery started to die so quickly so I had to recharge for each leg . I have to stop and do the other leg either after two or three hours or after one day then the hair stock in the machine between the blades and now way I tried everything washing it while brushing the hair . I am surprised I have less hair than most and I donot let it grow long . I use the machine twice a month so for it to have hair inside the blade is so annoying. I called Braun and of course they want me to pay for replacement around $50 which is not worth it not to mention their customer service really really suck . It is supposed to be used with wet skin . I never did and then the customer service lady asked me where I charge my machine claiming that because I charge it in my bathroom that&#x27;s why the charger and the battery is not working probably . I am an educated person yes I know with humidity it can affect the machine but I donot store it there and considering a customer for a very long time and had no problem with previous Baun then I thought it would last me at least 3 years but not one year . I throw it away and bought Philips  instead . so the bottom line . while this braun is a dream since they finally create a hair remover that is cordless it will die in a year or less than any other machine.</li>
    <li> OUCH. Thats all I have to say about this. I don&#x27;t think this is right for me because when my hair grows back it is inside the skin even if I exfoliate often. It itches so bad!!! I don&#x27;t really use it anymore.</li>
    <li> Good:&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;* Grab most hairs, even the fine ones that my old Remington couldn&#x27;t. You&#x27;ll notice that you may have missed a few hairs afterwards on close inspection.&lt;br /&gt;* Comfortable. It doesn&#x27;t feel the plucking in my legs at all. My previous Remington hurt and kept grabbing my skin.&lt;br /&gt;* Feels great to use. Its ergonomic, balanced and light.&lt;br /&gt;* Light illuminates hard to see hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad:&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;* For me, it only works for legs. Anywhere else is too painful. This will vary with each person.&lt;br /&gt;* This will not work while plugged in. It gets annoying when it dies prematurely and you have part of your legs epilated. As the battery ages, the duration of each use will decrease. When the battery goes, so does the shaver. I can think of two reasons why Braun would do this: 1) Profit - The device would be perfect. It would never fail, so they would not get another purchase out of you, and 2) Safety - Some people would probably plug this in and use it in the wet bathtub because it was Wet &amp; Dry. That would be a lawsuit Braun wants to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;* Multiple passes are needed.&lt;br /&gt;* The light should be on top in addition to the bottom. When I epilate, I like to look over the device to see my progress. Instead, I have to look awkwardly below it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All being said, this is the best epilator I have ever used. It does the job painlessly (for the legs) and gets me almost 100% hairless.</li>
    <li> Okay, so what&#x27;s a man doing with this thing? Easy answer. If you&#x27;re brave and willing, it gets rid of back hair and other places you don&#x27;t want it. Just charge it up and turn the switch. Remember that epilators pull hair quickly out of its follicle. The process can smart a bit and you get used to it. I can&#x27;t begin to imagine how waxing would feel, nor would I care to. If you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t like a lot of body hair getting in the way, you have several options and after trying this one, I have to say, I really like it. It&#x27;s fast and really does the job. I immediately noticed the smoothness and relief from hairs pulling though my shirt. Just charge it up, turn on the switch and it spins up to speed. The roller bezel provided, works well or you can use the grooved one but it doesn&#x27;t sweep across the skin as smoothly nor does it pivot like the roller head. It is expensive but it really does the job. I can imagine how nice it would work on legs for women. Braun makes fine products and this is no exception. It could stand to be a bit less expensive for the unit but then their very good shavers aren&#x27;t inexpensive either. The included pre application sheets lift the hairs and make it easier but I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference. Great unit, Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to everyone, who needs the best. I&#x27;d been using this for more than 4 years and prefer it over all other hair-removal products.</li>
