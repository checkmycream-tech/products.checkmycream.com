      <li>This all sounds great, but the features I like best about this shaver are the good battery power, the pop-up trimmer (which provides a nice crisp edge), and the wash ability of the shaver (just pop the head off and rinse).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Close shave and SMOOTH as a baby&#x27;s bottom!!</li>
      <li>[[VIDEOID:moX5QDJIAA5ENM]]It is a great looking shaver, shaves very well for me (better than my Philips Norelco XL), trimmer works excellent for me, is easier to clean monthly, and has great charge level status lights.  </li>
      <li>and I found it to work amazingly well.  </li>
      <li>I thought it was amazing.  </li>
      <li>Shaves good, nice to be able to use as cord or corded.  </li>
      <li>I have used the Braun Series 7 Pulsonic electric razor (A razor costing twice as much as the Remington), and the razor I consider to be the best electric shave</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a pop-up trimmer that does as good a job on sideburns and  mustaches as most tools, although a specialized beard trimmer might be a bit</li>
      <li>No question that this Remington is a nice piece of work.  </li>
      <li>I tested it on my own legs</li>
      <li>This is a super great electric shaver, which is so smooth to use and is very easy to keep clean!!!!</li>
      <li>The push-button is very easy to accidentally turn off while</li>
      <li>The battery meter is very easy to read.</li>
      <li>This model has one great quality, though: It charges in an hour and gives about two weeks worth of shaves from one charge.  </li>
      <li>It also is a very comfortable feel in my hand.  </li>
      <li>Good price, arrived quickly</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thrilled to have a quick alternative to Mr. Razor!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite travel shaver.</li>
      <li>That is like a 335i BMW with more options being cheaper than a 325i.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Sure.</li>
      <li>Much better than the black-on-gray LCD on my Braun.</li>
      <li>I say more?</li>
      <li>Overall, I am highly impressed by this shaver.  </li>
      <li>I found it gave me a closer shave than my rotary razor (which is also a Remington), and I was able to shave faster, which alleviated the rash issue as well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not terrible, mind you, but with a blade</li>
      <li>It is quicker and he looks even more handsome.  </li>
      <li>(I understand most people reading this review won&#x27;t be affected by this, of course)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I assume he will need to use it more often to get the feel of it.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I am very happy with it and am going to immediately stop using my Norelco XL and use this from now</li>
      <li>battery life indicator will help me make sure that it&#x27;s always charged, so I don&#x27;t run out of power before I finish a shave.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;He has owned many electric razors</li>
      <li>It is better around my neck, chin line, and lip than my rotary, but still takes some time on my neck.  </li>
      <li>It is noticeably better for both than my Philips Norelco XL.  </li>
      <li>I thought it was okay.  </li>
      <li>I cleaned the shaver with alcohol and it works ok.  </li>
      <li>Like most men, I don&#x27;t love shaving but for all the reasons we do this barbaric thing to our faces, I still do it.</li>
      <li>I have been a blade razor shaver for 40 years, and decided to give this product a try: I was not disappointed!  </li>
      <li>If you are more concerned about convenience and don&#x27;t worry about a more significant five oclock shadow.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The head is quite large and covers a good deal of your face whilst shaving with the head pivoting to match the contours of your face quite well.  </li>
      <li>But most importantly, what did my husband think about it.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use</li>
      <li>Once you cut through the tape, the contents are easily removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Pivots easily in all directions&lt;</li>
      <li>Also cleans easily.  </li>
      <li>Charges easily and holds its charge well.  </li>
      <li>He wasn&#x27;t thrilled when he opened his present, but once he tried it, he loved it.  </li>
      <li>It leaves much to be desired when it comes to a good clean cut.</li>
      <li>This is fine, but I prefer the slider switch on my Braun.</li>
      <li>Just a quick rinse under a running faucet while running the shaver gets most, if not all, of the hair out.</li>
      <li>On the positive side, the shaver looks nice, is easy to hold and maneuver, and is easy to clean.</li>
      <li>This made a *huge* difference in the closeness of the shave I got.  </li>
      <li>It provides a smooth, close shave</li>
      <li>Also easy to clean.</li>
      <li>It felt so cheap</li>
      <li>it is easy to clean and store;&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>This razor shaves as close but does not glide as smoothly.  </li>
      <li>It has a cheap, plastic feel to it.  </li>
      <li>This Remington feels cheap and plasticy.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>It is important to start this review by stating that I am NOT a fan of electric shavers.  </li>
      <li>Easy to clean</li>
      <li>The important areas, the cheeks, chin, etc never had ANY discomfort whatsoever.  </li>
      <li>In any case, you&#x27;ll get the best shave if you use it every day, since short bristly hairs are much easier to cut with any electric.  </li>
      <li>The Remington you simply clean with water which is quick, easy, and affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I think it works just as well as many higher priced razors.</li>
      <li>Shaving has never been so much fun!</li>
      <li>I have always preferred the simplicity and convenience of an electric shaver; however, I&#x27;ve spent most of my adult life searching for the perfect electric while knowing in my heart that one will never match a bladed shave.</li>
      <li>I would have given it a three at first, but i&#x27;m liking it more as time go&#x27;s on.</li>
      <li>but it does cost significantly more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The instructions tell you that you can clean the head by holding it under running water but not to immerse the shaver under water.  </li>
      <li>You can expect this shaver to give you a quick, close, irritation free shave with lots of shaves between charges.  </li>
      <li>Super comfortable to hold</li>
      <li>I keep the blades changed and clean it</li>
      <li>/&gt;But if I didn&#x27;t have access to water, foam, etc. and needed a clean-up, or wanted to entertain my fellow commuters by shaving in my car, or want to clean up in the evening before going out to dinner, would I recommend this?  </li>
      <li>I was able to shave with the blade about twice as fast and upon testing, the blade side was a significantly closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Significantly, the \\&quot;Remington FR-730\\&quot; can be quickly cleaned by removing the snap off head and rinsing it in water--no special cleaning cartridges are required.</li>
      <li>then this is an excellent shaver and one I would recommend but to me this is a fairly major oversight and hence only the 3 star rating.</li>
      <li>The shave charges is a good time and lasts for several days.</li>
      <li>razor may not replace a blade for most people, but it works very well and does provide a close shave.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does not cut as close as expected.</li>
    <li> It is important to start this review by stating that I am NOT a fan of electric shavers.  I have not used one in well over a decade due to their poor performance.  I have given away, returned, or resold (unopened) all the electrics that I have been given over the years.  However, I decided to go out on a limb with The Remington FR-730.  The first thing I noticed bout the product was its ergonomic design.  Are people tired of hearing about \\&quot;ergonomic designs\\&quot; yet?  Well, in this product it is worth mentioning.  As a person who has to shave everyday, wielding a comfortable tool is an important aspect of the product.  Next I noticed how quickly this shaver worked.  It provided rapid performance as well as a smooth shave at the same time.  I know shaving is not a race, and nothing is faster than a blade, but as we all know, sometimes time is of the essence and getting the groomed look is paramount before heading out the door.  I would say that as a daily maintenance shaver, the Remington FR-730 is going to get you clean and smooth as fast as a blade.  I can say that because this is a dry shaver and the time is made up in not having to prep or clean up a shave cream or shave gel.  LEt&#x27;s briefly talk about the after-burn.  Is it there?  Well, that depends on how long you dwell on one particular area and how sensitive your skin is.  I noticed a very slight irritation on my neck, due to working a little too hard on those stubborn neck hairs, but I do not fault the shaver for that.  The important areas, the cheeks, chin, etc never had ANY discomfort whatsoever.  The product is about as simple as you can get.  It includes the shaver, a charging cord and a small travel bag.  Do you really need anything else.  Overall, I am highly impressed by this shaver.  These things have come a long way, and it looks like Remington might be leading the pack with this item.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, rechargeable, and comes with a carry case that fits the razor and charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s reason enough, but I won&#x27;t stop there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head design is just like my older Braun 3-series. 2 foils with a trimmer in between. The first foil has irregularly shaped holes like the later Braun 3, 5, and 7 -series shavers. I&#x27;ve found that gives you a closer shave than the traditional circular holes. The back foil is the traditional circular lattice. Unlike my older Braun 3-series, this head has a very large range of motion and it&#x27;s well-damped so the head doesn&#x27;t just bobble all over the place. The smaller foils, light weight, and range of movement gives the shaver a light touch on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a nice big clear plastic cover than clips over the entire head. This is a crucial component for a travel razor because if you dent the foils, they will make contact with the blades, which will create a hot spot and dull the blade. This cover will protect the foils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s much quieter than my Braun. That&#x27;s something I think people often overlook when shopping for shavers. But comparing the 2 side-by-side, I really like how quiet the Remington is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A battery seems to last a long time and on short trips, you may not even have to pack the charger. The battery meter is very easy to read. 4 green bars taper down towards the 5th bar which is red. Much better than the black-on-gray LCD on my Braun. When you turn it off, the bars turn off and you can&#x27;t see them under the mirrored plastic. It gives the shaver a seamless look when it&#x27;s not in use. The description says it will last 10 days. I haven&#x27;t verified, but it seems plausible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger is a switching type that works both in 110V and 220V countries. You just need to find the right adapter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is waterproof, but I would refrain from getting the charging port wet, for obvious safety reasons. Just a quick rinse under a running faucet while running the shaver gets most, if not all, of the hair out. Be sure to shake it off and let it dry before you pop the cover on. The stainless blades and foils can probably tolerate a bit of moisture, but I don&#x27;t recommend pushing your luck if you&#x27;d like this to last you a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body is slim, rounded, and arched which makes it easier to handle. Brauns are usually flat, which is less comfortable to hold. I understand the reasoning for a flat razor. The asymmetrical shape increases your proprioception. You intuitively know when the blades are parallel with your face. Having used the Remington&#x27;s rounder grip, I don&#x27;t miss the flat shape. It&#x27;s only a bit of an issue when using the trimmer because the grip arches away from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is pretty decent. It cuts pretty close. It&#x27;ll trim a side-burn well, but this is definitely not for serious beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The on-button has a short stroke and a positive click. This is fine, but I prefer the slider switch on my Braun. The push-button is very easy to accidentally turn off while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was convenient too. Seems Remington stole a page from Amazon&#x27;s Frustration-Free Packaging handbook. It came in a stylish black and red box. Once you cut through the tape, the contents are easily removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I would down-classify this as a travel shaver rather than a full-time shaver, because it doesn&#x27;t feel very durable. My Braun has lasted 8+ years and the only thing it ever needed was a new foil. This Remington feels cheap and plasticy. I may be overthinking it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: It does everything well. It&#x27;s my favorite travel shaver.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moX5QDJIAA5ENM]]It is a great looking shaver, shaves very well for me (better than my Philips Norelco XL), trimmer works excellent for me, is easier to clean monthly, and has great charge level status lights.  But it is a little noisier, daily cleaning takes a little more work, and the bag is just okay.  Overall, I am very happy with it and am going to immediately stop using my Norelco XL and use this from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is noticeably louder than I had expected (as seen in the video), but isn&#x27;t too loud compared to some really cheap ones I&#x27;ve had in the past.  I really wish it were a bit more quiet, but is ignorable enough to only be a small negative in my mind.  But in shaving performance, it works really well for me.  In both shaving and trimming.  It is noticeably better for both than my Philips Norelco XL.  It also is a very comfortable feel in my hand.  I really like the battery status lights shows the level clearly.  They are nicely hidden under the shiny surface.  The daily cleaning is a little more work to pop off the head, shake and brush out, compared to flip open, dump, and rinse from my rotary.  But the monthly cleaning is much easier, still some work, but nowhere near the complicated work described for my rotary.  Of course a more expensive shaver with a cleaning system would be nice.  But this seems doable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether a rotary or foil shaver works best for you will vary.  I have found no rotary shaver can really pick up my hair without using a lot of force.  Foil shavers are just a different design and work better for me.  Now this foil shaver has a good foil design with various shaped holes that for me really do catch hair pretty well, better than my rotary XL.  It still doesn&#x27;t mean only one pass, but it generally takes less pressure and work than my rotary.  It is better around my neck, chin line, and lip than my rotary, but still takes some time on my neck.  One thing to remember is that you still need to use circular motion with this foil shaver.  If you are shaving only in straight motions, it will not grab some stubborn hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacement Parts: [[ASIN:B008KHV0WC Remington SPF-73 Screen and Blades]]</li>
    <li> I have been a blade razor shaver for 40 years, and decided to give this product a try: I was not disappointed!  I used it for the recommended three weeks before making any judgments, and can offer the following observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- the razor shaves my heavy, dark beard very closely, much more closely than other electric razors I have tried;&lt;br /&gt;- it holds a charge very well, lasting a week or more before having to recharge it, which is very simple - just plug it in;&lt;br /&gt;- it is easy to clean and store;&lt;br /&gt;- it is somewhat loud, the sound measuring about 70 decibels, which is equivalent to loud street noise or an individual singing fortissimo at three feet or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I will probably go back to a blade razor. My heavy beard is visible by noon or so using this razor, and I prefer a closer, longer-lasting shave than this razor can deliver.  If you have a light beard or sensitive skin, this may be the razor for you!</li>
    <li> Close shave and SMOOTH as a baby&#x27;s bottom!! Shaving has never been so much fun! So, did I over do it?</li>
    <li> Great shaver. Just to add that, when you have to use it corded, the bungee-type power cord is only 24&#x27;&#x27; long (approx. 36&#x27;&#x27; when stretched out). So, your face must be that close to the power socket to shave.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice razor!  It provides a smooth, close shave and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  It&#x27;s not perfect, but it offers a lot of features that make it desirable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;- Trimmer works very well&lt;br /&gt;- Super comfortable to hold&lt;br /&gt;- Nonslip grip&lt;br /&gt;- Battery life indicator helps prevent an unfinished shave&lt;br /&gt;- Pivots easily in all directions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quiet enough and I really like the way it feels in my hand.  The trimmer works very well, and opens to just the right angle and distance to get a close and accurate trim.  Some trimmers are awkward to use, but not this one.  It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, but it shaves closer than some other electric razors that I&#x27;ve used in the past.  The thin shield allows it to shave about as close as you can get with an electric.  I also like the way I can rinse it under water, making it a breeze to keep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life indicator will help me make sure that it&#x27;s always charged, so I don&#x27;t run out of power before I finish a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, but it doesn&#x27;t feel as well made or sturdy as other razors and I&#x27;m left wondering how easily it might break if I drop it.  The body is made mainly of plastic, which helps keep it light weight.  Some plastics are very durable and you can just tell it when you hold it in your hands.  Unfortunately, this one gives the impression it might crack easily if dropped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor may not replace a blade for most people, but it works very well and does provide a close shave.  The light weight and rechargeable aspect makes it perfect for travel.  So perfect that I wish it came with a car charger.  It&#x27;s a good razor and I think it works just as well as many higher priced razors.</li>
    <li> The Remington FR730 is constructed with two \\&quot;flexing foils\\&quot; (I would call them straight shaving heads) and something called an \\&quot;intercept trimmer\\&quot; which is designed to shave long hairs. This all sounds great, but the features I like best about this shaver are the good battery power, the pop-up trimmer (which provides a nice crisp edge), and the wash ability of the shaver (just pop the head off and rinse).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I am not crazy about is the basic design of straight shaving heads, especially in comparison to my old Norelco shaver, which has three rotary shaving heads. The advantage of the old Norelco is that the shaving head flexes in just about any direction and follows the contour of your face much more easily. While the Remington 730 has \\&quot;full-flex\\&quot; technology, in reality it flexes back and forth (minimally) and side-to-side (very minimally).  To some extent, it&#x27;s like rolling a two-inch length of wooden dowel across your face. It&#x27;s not completely uncomfortable, but it&#x27;s certainly noticeable. In any event, I&#x27;m definitely partial to the Norelco style with the three rotary shaving heads (by the way, today&#x27;s equivalent model would be the Norelco PT730 at just over half the price of the Remington FR730 - and, no, I have no idea why both models end with \\&quot;730\\&quot;!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;ll give it three stars since it does shave fairly close and shavers are such a matter of personal preference, but I think I&#x27;ll stick with my old razor.</li>
    <li> Admittedly it&#x27;s been a while since I have used a really good electric razor.  In fact I have been away from them for so long I was amazed at the blades on this thing, the pivoting head, the battery life and performance.  No question that this Remington is a nice piece of work.  It seems very solid to me and is very easy to use.  Although the instructions specify a classic circular motion while shaving, I have found that the pivoting heads on this actually work a little better just moving it up and down for the most part.  The heads move over your face and adjust to its contour effortlessly. The battery promises 10 days of shaving on average with just a one hour charge, and a clear battery meter provides you with plenty of warning when it is about to go dry. Although the razor has a convenient pop up trimmer for finer areas, its basically just for side taps or small mustaches.  I found it lacking as a real trimmer around my big mustache and even a little irritating. I think many would find it next to useless trying to keep a beard well groomed with it. Despite that one minus, I feel it really just doesn&#x27;t come any easier than this as far as a shaving experience from an electric razor. That being said, I have to confess that I am still not sold on an electric razor.  My beard is medium heavy and I had to continually go over the same places a number of times to really feel it was close enough.  A liquid pre shave improved the performance a little and I recommend one if you don&#x27;t mind the extra step and expense.  But even then it is my opinion that this razor cannot come near matching the closeness of a wet blade.  This razor is nice when you just want to touch up a 5:00 shadow for a night out, or, if you are just in a hurry and don&#x27;t feel like going through a regular shave.  But make no mistake about it, if you have even a medium beard you will feel some definite fuzz left behind with this razor unless you want to spend an exorbitant amount of time going over your face time and again.  In conclusion, this razor is a quality piece that in my opinion feels like it will last a while and give you a good enough shave with its blade technology to justify its price.  However if you are a die hard wet shave man like myself, I feel that I can only recommend this to those that want the occasional convenience of a shave without all the soap and time it takes.  This still can&#x27;t beat the wet shave... : )time and again.  In conclusion, this razor is a quality piece that in my opinion feels like it will last a while and give you a good enough shave with its blade technology to justify its price.

    <li> I should first of all say that you will not get as close of a shave with any electric razor as you can get with a normal bladed razor. With that being said, there are situations where electric razors make sense. If you are more concerned about convenience and don&#x27;t worry about a more significant five oclock shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you have decided to go with an electric razor, the question becomes which one. I have used the Braun Series 7 Pulsonic electric razor (A razor costing twice as much as the Remington), and the razor I consider to be the best electric shave that one can have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the Braun as the benchmark, I consider the Remington to be an excellent electric razor, with some advantages over the Braun. The braun has a cleaning station which automatically cleans and lubricates the head after each shave. The problem with this is that the cleaning cartridges are insanely expensive, and end up costing more per shave than using blades and shave cream. The Remington you simply clean with water which is quick, easy, and affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe the Remington yields a shave that is as close and comfortable as that given by the Braun, but the Remington costs half as much and you dont have to buy those expensive cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that if you have decided to go the route of an electric razor, I believe this Remington delivers maximum bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> pros:&lt;br /&gt;- fairly close shave, though not as good as the Remington FR-500.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;- the worst build quality of any razor I&#x27;ve ever tried over $30. It felt so cheap I thought the vibrations would cause the whole razor to crack open in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;- I was so distracted by the cheapness of the razor, the extreme vibration of the plastic handle, that I couldn&#x27;t stand using it. I used Remingtons for many years, but if this is the future of Remington, I won&#x27;t buy their razors any more.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in a long while because the shavers of old irritated my face and especially my neck.  Although a little apprehensive, wanting a quick weekend and vacation shaving solution, I gave this one a shot.  Eureka!  Even after repeated and aggressive strokes to get a closer and closer shave, NO irritation what-so-ever.  You can expect this shaver to give you a quick, close, irritation free shave with lots of shaves between charges.  And it is super easy and fast to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head attached to the shaver body and the snap off foil assembly can be cleaned under running water, however, the razon is NOT submersible.  I found that my shave is MUCH closer if I run the foil and head under running water.  The screen and cutters are replaceable and other spare parts are available on Remington&#x27;s web site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charge level is clearly shown, is easy to see, even in the dark and similar to a battery meter, with four green lights (full charge) and one red light (charge).  After the initial charge, it is lasting about 15 shaves.  AC power charger is 100VAC to 240 VAC making it international.  Shaver does not have a holder (no big deal), charger cable just plugs into the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaver came with charger, cleaning brush and a carry bag.  I&#x27;m thrilled to have a quick alternative to Mr. Razor!</li>
    <li> I selected the Remington FR-730 Pivot &amp; Flex Men&#x27;s Rechargeable Shaver for my husband.  My husband shaves every day and also has a mustache.  He uses a regular disposable shaver for his face but he uses our dog groomer shears for his mustache, side burns and the back of his neck.  This is my job to shave the back of his neck.  I do not particularly care for this chore as the cord on the electric groomer is constantly in the way.  I am always fearful that I am going to cut the cord in half while trying to shave all the fuzzies from the back of my husband&#x27;s neck.  To my surprise when I opened the package there is a pop-up trimmer that offers more precision to this tedious task.  We immediately went to the bathroom to try out this pop up trimmer and I found it to work amazingly well.  There was not any cord to get in the way and it trimmed fast and close and did not irritate his neck.  I thought it was amazing.  But most importantly, what did my husband think about it.  He said he did get a close shave, but he kept losing track of where he started shaving as his shaving cream helps him out with this.  I assume he will need to use it more often to get the feel of it.  He did say that it would be good to have when we go out in the evening and he wants to get rid of 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver operates with a rechargeable battery that lasts for up to 10 days of shaving with a 60-minute charge. The entire head snaps off for easy cleaning.  The instructions tell you that you can clean the head by holding it under running water but not to immerse the shaver under water.  It has a pivoting neck and comes with a charging cord, travel pouch, and instruction guide.  A digital LCD battery gauge shows the charge left on the battery by indicating a full charge showing green going to red as the battery runs down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it does have some great features, gave him a close shave but I am not sure that he will use it on a daily basis.  Old habits are hard to break.ak.</li>
    <li> I shave every other day and I don&#x27;t have thick hair. That said, I have used a Braun with a cleaning unit for quite a while and it&#x27;s been a great razor. I keep the blades changed and clean it every few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington FR-730 is a good razor. The head is a lot larger than I am used to using but it flows across my face well enough. It&#x27;s louder than my Braun but that&#x27;s not a big deal. I was surprised when the razor arrived fully charged. I pretty much unwrapped it and used it for the first time in minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is a breeze, it doesn&#x27;t have a separate cleaning unit like my Braun but some water on the head cleans it right up. I have no hesitation in recommending this unit.</li>
    <li> First, a little background info.  My beard is very heavy, which I normally shave clean every day with a blade.  I have shaved with an electric as well on occasion but I prefer a blade for speed and closeness.  I also let my son try this razor and recorded his comments.  He has a pretty heavy beard, although not quite as heavy as mine.  He normally shaves with an electric but he does not typically shave every day.  My first razor was a Remington electric and at the time, it was the king of electrics in my opinion.  I tried a newer Remington a few years ago and is was different breed.  It was way cheaper and I felt they lost their #1 standing to other foreign brands.  I jumped at the chance to try this new high end razor to see if they made a come-back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did three comparison tests: Remington vs. a blade, Remington vs. another brand name electric and finally let my son use the razor to see how it handled 5 days of growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Test One (day one) was Remington vs. a blade.  I shaved one side of my face with my normal Fusion blade.  I shaved the other side with the Remington.  This was no contest.  I was able to shave with the blade about twice as fast and upon testing, the blade side was a significantly closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Test Two (day two) was a blind test.  I shaved one side of my face with the Remington and the other side with a Panasonic electric razor.  The Panasonic glided more smoothly over my face but the end result was a very similar shave in closeness and comfort.  I had my wife do the blind test.  She first chose the Remington side as being more smooth but as she felt the areas around my chin and neck, she thought the Remington side had a lot of rough areas.  At this point, I did not tell her which was which but went back in the bathroom and I went over the areas again more carefully.  After the more careful re-shave, she could not tell the difference.  Still, I had to re-shave with the Remington.  Not so with the other electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Test Three was my son&#x27;s test after not shaving for 5 days.  This was a good test because the Remington is supposed to have a center strip for cutting long or stray hairs.  With 5 days of growth, he said it was \\&quot;ripping hairs out\\&quot;.  When it did cut, it cut fairly close without having to push too hard.  He thought the trimmer was so/so.  I thought it was okay.  He also said the razor had a general feeling of cheapness, which I agree.  It has a cheap, plastic feel to it.  I doubt it would survive a drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can find this on sale, it is a decent razor but for $90, it is not such a deal.  My $50 Panasonic does a better job overall.  This razor shaves as close but does not glide as smoothly.  My son&#x27;s high end Panasonic with linear motor is way better overall but it does cost significantly more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Fast Charge (under an hour)&lt;br /&gt;Pretty close shave for an electric&lt;br /&gt;Nice battery display&lt;br /&gt;Small Charger&lt;br /&gt;Includes soft carrying case&lt;br /&gt;Easy rinse to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Rather large razor&lt;br /&gt;Feels cheap&lt;br /&gt;Motor rather weak&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t glide across face as well as some other brands.</li>
    <li> Is this Remington much better than other modern electric shavers at this price?  No, but it&#x27;s pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The metal foils covering the blades on my old shaver would heat up, making for discomfort while shaving and a rash afterwards.  The Remington doesn&#x27;t.  Despite thorough use all over my face, I felt no increase in temperature. And the head is mounted on a very responsive set of springs, so it floats and conforms to your face.  No pinching of hairs, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s rechargeable.  It fully charges up in couple of hours, and the charge lasts for about an hour of use, which is a week&#x27;s worth of shaves.  That&#x27;s convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head can be rinsed under a faucet, so you don&#x27;t have to use the brush exclusively, flicking stubble all over your sink and huffing and puffing at it.  You just pop off the foils covering the blades, rinse, let them dry and pop the foils back on.  It&#x27;s recommended that you still use the included brush on a regular basis, but at least you don&#x27;t have to do it constantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a pop-up trimmer that does as good a job on sideburns and  mustaches as most tools, although a specialized beard trimmer might be a bit better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering its size, it&#x27;s lightweight, because it has a lot of plastic parts. It fits very well in the hand, and feels solid, but because it&#x27;s largely plastic I doubt it&#x27;ll last a long time. Don&#x27;t count on using this razor for fifteen years, especially if you drop it on a tile floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most users of electrics don&#x27;t expect them to equal a blade for closeness, and this Remington won&#x27;t change that view. It doesn&#x27;t come close to eliminating the need for a blade if you want a close, clean shave on every part of your face, unless you want to rub and rub for ten minutes, and then maybe, if you happen to have the kind of beard that is well suited to an electric shaver--thick and coarse and short works best.  Yes, it does shave reasonably close, but the basic configuration of thefoil and blades makes it almost impossible to cut the hairs that don&#x27;t spring straight out from the skin.  In my case, no amount of effort would cut all the hairs on my neck, since like most mens&#x27; neck hairs, they grow parallel to the skin rather than perpendicular.  I use the short, circular strokes recommended, and go over and over certain areas, and still, I wouldn&#x27;t want anyone looking very closely at the results.  Not terrible, mind you, but with a blade it&#x27;s all gone with a quick swipe, and here, it&#x27;s just not.  In any case, you&#x27;ll get the best shave if you use it every day, since short bristly hairs are much easier to cut with any electric.  But no matter what I do, I have to use a blade at least once every four days to trim the neck hairs that simply will not be cut using this razor and will otherwise just keep growing longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is using an electric less expensive than using a blade?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you change your razor blades frequently, costs of blades,  shaving cream, and anything else you may like to use do mount up.  But if you replace the blades on this shaver every six months as suggested at $30 a pop (including a new screen, which you have to buy with them), keep in mind that you&#x27;re spending another $60 per year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is an electric faster?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not in my experience. With all the rubbing and going over problem spots, using this electric takes twice as long as using a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if I didn&#x27;t have access to water, foam, etc. and needed a clean-up, or wanted to entertain my fellow commuters by shaving in my car, or want to clean up in the evening before going out to dinner, would I recommend this?  Sure. But for the price, it&#x27;s just adequate.</li>
    <li> Electric shavers have been around for quite some time, and as such, there are many models available in many different price ranges. The Remington FR-730 is probably somewhere in the upper-middle class. It&#x27;s a well-built shaver, but it doesn&#x27;t have some of the frills you&#x27;d see in a much more expensive (think: $250+) electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, rather than the self-cleaning features that more expensive brands have, the F-730 allows you to rinse the head under water. This feature makes it a lot easier to clean than cheaper electric razors, but, yes, it still requires a little bit of work. Similarly, the battery life - 60-minutes to charge for 40-minutes of operating time - isn&#x27;t as amazing as the very expensive electric shavers. Fortunately, it&#x27;s good enough that you can go 2-3 days without charging or, if you&#x27;re forgetful like me, you&#x27;ll have time to charge it up in the morning before going to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the shave itself, the FR-730 has two pivoting in-line blades which, according to the description, are meant to give a \\&quot;close, consistent shave with smooth results.\\&quot; But unless you press the shaver firmly against your skin - an action warned against in the instruction manual - the shave just doesn&#x27;t compare with a traditional blade. Of course, this is typical of most electric razors. You&#x27;re getting convenience (and fewer accidental cuts) while giving up the smoothness of a manual shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So would I recommend the FR-730? Definitely. I would, of course, recommend that everybody have an electric razor because (even if you prefer a manual blade) they are so extremely convenient sometimes. And for its price, the FR-730 does a good job. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> As part of my participation in the Amazon Vines program, I received on of these for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now.  The shave is a closer, cleaner one than I had been getting from my Braun model.  It even does a credible job on that difficult to get scruff on my neck.  The trimmer is smaller than what I&#x27;ve had on other models of electric shavers, but it feels like you have more control and is a good size for tackling pesky hair around the ears.  The Remington&#x27;s battery holds its charge nicely as well and the carrying case and plastic guard means it will travel with minimal problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a quality product that I will continue to use for the forseeable future.</li>
    <li> I only bought this because it was on sale. The trimming head leaves lots of stubble behind. The on/off button is in an awkward spot on the handle and I keep shutting it off by accident. The mustache trimming head is at such a way that you can&#x27;t see your face over the top trimmer. Poorly designed and well worth passing on.</li>
    <li> First let me say that my brother in law swears that the Remmington is the only electric razor that is tough enough to  cut his thick beard.  I do not have a thick beard.  It felt plenty strong, but I had a hard time keeping the screen on my face.  I never felt I got a good shave and had to work pretty hard to cover every spot.  I have always used Norelco razors in the past.  I never adapted to this one and returned it for a Norelco.  One other negative for this razor.  I was surprised that I had to recharge it after about two weeks, maybe a little less.  The Norelco holds a charge for at least a month.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a superb shaver.  Easy to use and I use it to shave my scalp - a large area..  VERY easy on my skin - my last electric razor was a cheap Wahl which irritated my scalp.  Charges easily and holds its charge well.  Also cleans easily.  I cannot imagine a truly better shaver ESPECIALLY for the price.  Note however that I have only used it for about two months so I cannot vouch for its longevity.</li>
    <li> This is a super great electric shaver, which is so smooth to use and is very easy to keep clean!!!!</li>
    <li> My son got this for Christmas&lt;br /&gt;and everything is working well</li>
    <li> I have been a blade shaver for as long as I can remember. My collection of razors goes from the old Gillette safety razor days through injector blade shavers, on to double, triple and now more blades than you can count units. However, being lazy, I tend to shave in the shower. Not only does that result in a sloppy job, it really adds time and gallons of hot water to the job. I got this razor because it seemed simple enough to use, had a good price and I trust the Remington name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basics: The razor is ergonomically shaped. The sides are made of a non-slip rubber material that works well. There is a green light-red light \\&quot;gas gauge\\&quot; so you can visually judge the charge level of the battery. Noise level is moderate. The sideburn trimmer slips out and back in easily.&lt;br /&gt;On the Face: For the broad, flat surfaces of my face (e.g., cheeks), the shaver does a decent job, leaving behind a smooth feel. The sideburn trimmer squares off the hair line without digging into my skin. But I have one complaint and it&#x27;s the same one I&#x27;ve had with the few other electric shavers I have tried. Because of the shape of the head or the weird way my beard grows, electrics just don&#x27;t do a good job cutting the hairs that grow horizontally (like along the jaw line). These hairs don&#x27;t stick up enough to make it into the slots on the head so they can be lopped off. This shaver is no worse and may be a bit better than most cutting these off without having to go through a lot of gyrations.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: I have been using the Remington FR-730 for a few weeks and it&#x27;s making me an electric saver guy. Like most men, I don&#x27;t love shaving but for all the reasons we do this barbaric thing to our faces, I still do it. Not having to stay an extra few minutes in the shower wasting water and then realizing later that I left a hunk of beard unshaved is worth the price of admission.  If you&#x27;re looking for a good way to make the transition to electric shaving, you could do a lot worse than this reasonably priced razor.reasonably priced razor.</li>
    <li> I really like this shaver. Unlike every other electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned it will actually cut all the strange thin and curling little hairs that grow on my neck and under my chin. It&#x27;s the center of the three heads with the little slots that seems to do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington FR-730 is basic, hefty, solid, functional and seems reasonably well-made. A charge seems to last for a couple of weeks or more. It&#x27;s not fancy but gets the job done and I&#x27;d recommend it to anybody who values function over all else in a shaver.</li>
    <li> My husband typically only uses traditional razors on his beard, since his beard grows in so thick.  He was pleasantly surprised to discover that this electric razor can really pull its weight.  Small, portable, and extremely powerful.  This is an exceptional little razor.</li>
    <li> My husband normally doesn&#x27;t like electric razors because they irritate his face but wanted to try one again for days he was in a big rush. After trying this one two times he gave it back to me and said it didn&#x27;t work at all, he said he had to go over the same spot over and over again and it still missed 1/2 the hairs, the plus side was even with all this it didn&#x27;t irritate his skin but it also wasn&#x27;t cutting his hair and was taking vastly longer then a traditional shave. Thinking maybe he was just doing something wrong I tested it on my own legs (I already use an electric razor sometimes myself, and have used mens in the past as normally I feel they give a better and closer shave). No dice with this on my legs either, I checked and checked and it&#x27;s assembled correctly but it simply misses most of the hairs, it&#x27;s so gentle I let my 2yr old play with it while I used my normal electric razor! Maybe we got a dud but I just can&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> I am getting tired of electric shavers.  I can&#x27;t wet-shave, so I have to find an electric shaver which works.  This one is neither worse nor better than any other I have tried, but it takes a solid ten minutes to get something which resembles a close shave.  This model has one great quality, though: It charges in an hour and gives about two weeks worth of shaves from one charge.  That is way better than any other shaver I have owned.</li>
    <li> I have always preferred the simplicity and convenience of an electric shaver; however, I&#x27;ve spent most of my adult life searching for the perfect electric while knowing in my heart that one will never match a bladed shave. Having tried electric razors from most companies, from rotaries to foil, from wet to dry, I always returned to my bladed razor with occasional guick uses of an electric while traveling etc. I continued my search for the Holy Grail of electrics with the new \\&quot;Remington FR-730\\&quot; and while not ending my search, it has proven to be a very acceptable and efficacious electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Remington FR-730\\&quot; is a sleek looking, ergonomically designed electric razor that performed well during my testing period.  It is by no means a small unit but it does feel substantial in one&#x27;s hand while shaving but it is worth noting that the use of plastics and synthetics reduce its weight to allow for comfortable maneuvering on the face. It has a pop up trimmer that is most useful as a sideburn trimmer and cutter and less effective with mustaches and beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit has two surgical steel foils surrounding what they call an intercept trimmer designed to catch longer hairs during the shave cycle.  It has a pivoting and flexible head which allows it to move freely from left to right and up and down to more closely follow the contours of the face throughout the shaving experience--a feature I found useful especially along my neck and jaw areas which are difficult for me with most electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit has a battery that requires a 60 minute charge and will supposedly last for 10 days of shaving.  There is a tastefully subdued LED battery gauge on the handle that lets the user know how much battery time remains.  Significantly, the \\&quot;Remington FR-730\\&quot; can be quickly cleaned by removing the snap off head and rinsing it in water--no special cleaning cartridges are required. So far I have only cleaned mine with brush and compresssed air so I cannot report on how efficacious this wet cleaning is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this electric shaver a lot and am now using it in place of my older rotary but I still alternate shavings with a wet bladed shave.  Someday an electric shaver with sharp enough blades coupled with a motor generating sufficiently high speeds will be developed to match the quality of a bladed shave.  But until then, those users who prefer an electric for daily use or for travel can feel comfortable with this new Remington.</li>
    <li> The Remington FR-730 is a dual foil shaver that gives an excellent close shave.  The handle is adorned simply with a charge meter and an on/off button.  The shaver is very confortable to hold with the weight distribution being just right. In that respect it&#x27;s a pleasure to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;Since getting this shaver a couple of weeks ago, I&#x27;ve not yet had to re-charge it from being on a full charge so it&#x27;s great for taking with you on vacation.  The head is quite large and covers a good deal of your face whilst shaving with the head pivoting to match the contours of your face quite well.  The pivot mechanism is quite stiff although I&#x27;m sure with more use it might free up a little.&lt;br /&gt;The beard trimmer on the back of the razor does a good job and easily shaves down a few days worth of stubble.&lt;br /&gt;My main (and really only) problem with the shaver is that it actually misses some spots.  Right beside my ears (both sides) and just under my nose.  No matter which angle I turned the shaver it just would not reach these areas and I finally had to give up and just use the bear trimmer, which whilst good does not give the smooth, close shave of the main shaver foils.&lt;br /&gt;If you can live with this then this is an excellent shaver and one I would recommend but to me this is a fairly major oversight and hence only the 3 star rating.</li>
    <li> Took too long to get a clean shave.</li>
    <li> My husband disliked electric razors and has been using disposable for years.  I took a chance and purchased this shaver as a Christmas present.  He wasn&#x27;t thrilled when he opened his present, but once he tried it, he loved it.  It is quicker and he looks even more handsome.  I appreciate the product information provided by Amazon.</li>
    <li> It leaves much to be desired when it comes to a good clean cut. I spend more time having to go over the same area than my old eletric razor. Battery life is weak at best, I get 2 maybe 3 days on a charge. It works good for the actual face, but for neck and chin requires multiple passes at differnet angles to get the job done.</li>
    <li> I use electric razors almost exclusively, which might be a bit odd, since I&#x27;ve got the bald thing going on.  I&#x27;m typically not a fan of foil-based razors, as I&#x27;ve found they don&#x27;t get close enough and tend to give me a rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I was really surprised (and a bit happy) to see Remington gave this particular shaver a head that pivoted both forward and back as well as side-to-side.  This made a *huge* difference in the closeness of the shave I got.  I found it gave me a closer shave than my rotary razor (which is also a Remington), and I was able to shave faster, which alleviated the rash issue as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is quite good. I can shave my entire head 7 or 8 times before it&#x27;s time for a charge (this translates in almost double that for most guys just shaving your face).  After you&#x27;re done, you simply pop off the cover and rinse the entire works out, and you&#x27;re ready to go.  As a note, if you have hard water, this tends to dull the blades faster, so be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was overall very comfortable to use, and maneuvered very well over my entire head.  The only downside I had with the performance was when I was shaving my head. The foil razors in general tend to be very hard and don&#x27;t get as close as rotary razors, but only on my noggin - it&#x27;s kind of like rubbing a rock over your head.  (I understand most people reading this review won&#x27;t be affected by this, of course)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite that, I&#x27;ve essentially replaced my rotary razor with this one. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it, especially if you&#x27;re not bald. :)</li>
    <li> I gave this to my husband and he loves it! I asked him about his opinion and this is what he told me:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;My beard is light and usually let it grow for many weeks before and few weeks interlude of shaven face. My shaving requirements are thus not heavy.&lt;br /&gt;As a result, this is only my third Remington electric shaver over about 20 years, most recently the MS2 280.&lt;br /&gt;This new Remington FR-730 is a vast improvement: a more ergonomic shape and balance for the hand, more flexibility in the shaving head, a narrower clipper, and an indicator of charge level on the shaver. The shave is close, quick, and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Really a delight to use!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Need I say more?</li>
    <li> This is a shaver that does provide a close shave. The head is able to move to the contours of your face but it has its limitations because there is only one head. If you are looking for a super close shave then you would be better going for a shaver with multiple heads that have independent movement. The shave charges is a good time and lasts for several days. Overall this is a nice product for the price and I would consider purchasing it again</li>
    <li> I have just purchased the Remington 730 shaver but it has not arrived yet. I have not had a chance to review the performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the Cyber Monday deal which is going on as I am typing, has the Remington FR-730 model with 2 blades for about $54. However, you can get next higher model CHEAPER. The FR-750 model is the same shaver, but has THREE(3) blades instead of TWO.&lt;br /&gt;On checkout for the 750, select the coupon option and your price is reduced to&lt;br /&gt;under $50 for a higher model. The coupon gives you a $25 discount.  You save about $3 to $4 dollars by buying the 750.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why purchase the 730 when you can get the FR-750 cheaper? The 730 was listed at a higher price than the 750 from the beginning. That is like a 335i BMW with more options being cheaper than a 325i.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If someone could post the reason why the 750 is cheaper than the 730 please let me know. Post your opinion on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The link to the FR-750:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Remington-FR-750-Rechargeable-Flexing-Intercept/dp/B007P1T7HE/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1354243158&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;fr-750</li>
    <li> I ordered it as &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; .  That used to be it was returned for wrong product or was missing a piece.  I got it and to my surprise someone actually &amp;#34;USED&amp;#34; it.  I cleaned the shaver with alcohol and it works ok.  The clipper part does not work a all. Overall, it takes forever to shave and probably have to get the cover and blades reordered.  Never again will I order from the seller.  USED was USED aright!  If your going to resell please clean it first!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Shaves good, nice to be able to use as cord or corded.  Also easy to clean. Good price, arrived quickly</li>
    <li> I would have given it a three at first, but i&#x27;m liking it more as time go&#x27;s on.</li>
    <li> Hubby was the guinea pig for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has owned many electric razors this product doesn&#x27;t work any better or any worse.  He has dense hair growth.  This product doesn&#x27;t shave as well as manual-blade razor but, the battery life is the best he has owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Intercept Trimmer is poorly placed.  It is rough to trim side burns; it position creates issues with viewing the intended trim area.</li>
    <li> Though this shaver by Remington has some significant positives, my regular razor still outperforms it. On the positive side, the shaver looks nice, is easy to hold and maneuver, and is easy to clean. It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and can be used without shave lotion or soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t found any shaver that can compete with the closeness of a razor, and this shaver is no different. It just doesn&#x27;t deliver as close of a shave and is worthless if you have more than two days of stubble. In all fairness, the package insert does say that you have to use this product consistently for a few days to start getting a good shave. I used it for two weeks, and though the shaver did get better over time, ultimately, it just can&#x27;t beat the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I am in a hurry and need to shave quickly, I might turn to this shaver (even though the package advises otherwise), but for everyday work shaves, I will still use my razor.</li>
