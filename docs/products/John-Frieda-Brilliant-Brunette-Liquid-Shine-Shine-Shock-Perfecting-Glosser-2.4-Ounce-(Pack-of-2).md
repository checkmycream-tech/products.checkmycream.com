      <li>I love this product so much :)</li>
      <li>Thanks!!!</li>
      <li>I have alot of grey hair that is dryish and this makes it look very healthy!</li>
      <li>The best thing to do is to apply about a small amount on your hair and to work it in until evenly distributed.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, to be honest I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference in my hair.</li>

      <li>Exactly as it is named.  </li>

      <li>This really disappoints me when a company does this.</li>

      <li>They need to start selling it again and for a reasonable price too</li>
      <li>it really does make your hair shiny.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need to use as much of this product compared to Chi Silk Infusion.</li>
      <li>Since this gloss is transparent, it works very well on hair of any color, gives it shine and smoothness.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> OMG works well for curly thick hair to make her stay and look curly all day long</li>
    <li> Really Love This Product!  Can&#x27;t seem to find in local!  Do you have this product in the Lumberton, NC area!</li>
    <li> love this product from john frieda! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I love this product! It really adds a nice shine to my hair.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this product &amp; it really helps keep my dry curly hair looking healthy &amp; lush</li>
    <li> I EFFING LOVE THIS STUFF. I haven&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere near me. I have super straight extremely long brown hair. I get out of the shower and work about a nickel size squeeze of this stuff into it and I&#x27;m good to go all day. I wish I could find the leave in conditioner that John Frieda used to make. That was the best. Anyway the product is awesome and smells great.</li>
    <li> Great for dull old hair.</li>
    <li> This was an accidental order. I thought I was ordering John Freida&#x27;s Conditioner - which I love. I was disappointed when I realized my error, but decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m glad I did. It instantly adds instant salon-fresh shine. Great!</li>
    <li> Trying to get rid of frizz and straighten my hair. This works better than other products Ive tried.</li>
    <li> LOVE Shine Shock.  This was discontinued a few years back so I am thrilled I can still get in on Amazon.com.  Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. It&#x27;s the ONLY thing that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down but gives shine and controls frizz. So happy you offer it on your site!</li>
    <li> The shine it gives your hair is amazing. I wish they would bring back the blond liquid shine.</li>
    <li> I went to a medium brown shade on my hair (from a box) but my hair was so dull looking.  I had read about the John Frieda products and decided to try the John Frieda Brilliant Brunette Liquid Shine on my hair.  Believe me when I say it was amazing how my hair took on a shine that lasted for such a long time.  Every time I shampooed by hair, I used the Liquid Shine.  I so recommend this product.  Even if you have not dyed your hair, I think your own natural brown hair will benefit from the beautiful shine you will  get from using this amazing product.</li>
    <li> I love this hair product, even though my hair is mostly white now, not so much brilliant brunette!  It offers a shine without the greasiness that most products give.  The  stores do not seem to carry it as much as they used to, so I am glad I was able to purchase it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I am very disappointed that I can no longer buy it in the store though.</li>
    <li> I like this product smells great and does the job.  Sorry it&#x27;s been discontinued, they never ask us, do they? Hope I have enough to last until they bring it back again. Service was great, will definetly check shop here for other items in the future.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell the difference between this product and other Shinning products.  There is nothing special about Brunette.&lt;br /&gt;I like the shine produced by Aveda or Chi more than this one.&lt;br /&gt;I dislike the smell of most Frieda products, this one stays longer and the product does not feel good in your hands.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quite a good product. The only &#x27;complaint&#x27; : I was expecting the glosser to add a lot more shine to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;And it works best if you add it to damp hair, not dry hair.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that controls my frizz and I am so sad they have discontinued it.</li>
    <li> Long lasting shine and manageability!</li>
    <li> Okay product but I don&#x27;t like it as much as dry shampoo with a hint of color in it.</li>
    <li> I use it occasionally to add gloss to my hair, but not all the time because it is very heavy.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff. I apply a small amount to my wet hair and then I use it after I dry. It makes my hair SUPER soft and almost acts like a styler. It is my favorite thing I use as far as hair products. It also makes dry hair or dull hair look like it has more dimension.</li>
    <li> I use this in addition to Bumble and Bumble curl conscious and it leaves my hair manageable and shiny.</li>
    <li> This product really helped to tame the frizz.</li>
    <li> My friend told me about this product in October and I have been using it ever since. It can only be found at Ulta and it is $10 per box. I love this product as well as the price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Exactly as it is named.  Love it</li>
    <li> For some reason they discontinued this product and any that they have left they want your right hand for ! This really disappoints me when a company does this. I have hard to manage soft curly hair and this was the only product i have ever found that would tame my unruly curls. They need to start selling it again and for a reasonable price too or i won&#x27;t buy they&#x27;re products at all........</li>
    <li> Always my go to after I curl my hair so that it isn&#x27;t frizzy. I love this product so much :)</li>
    <li> Have used for several years - Good product, not able to find in stores.  Pleased to have found online.</li>
    <li> I love this product but it&#x27;s hard to find.It leave my curls soft and with some shine.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  My hairdresser wanted to know what I used to make my hair so soft and shiny.  Keeps the frizz down in humid weather too.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and I like the inverted squeeze bottle because I am able to fully use the product.</li>
    <li> Thanks again for making a difficult to locate product available!!  This leaves my hair smooth, manageable and shinny.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> I have thick rather unmanageable hair and this product really helps give my hair shine and tames the \\&quot;broomstick\\&quot; look of the ends.  I have just a bit of curl and it tends to go every which way.  The Shine Shock seems to soften the hair.  I use only one pump, the size of a large pearl, on wet hair, and comb it through before I blowdry and style.  Don&#x27;t use too much and don&#x27;t use it on dry hair.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and recently I used a shampoo that made a lot of my hair fall out. Basically it made my hair unhealthy so I&#x27;ve changed shampoos. I was looking for a hot oil treatment but saw this and thought it might make my hair just as shiny. Well I used it as directed and found out which way was best. Using this on damp hair is recommended. I did not have such great luck using it on dry hair. The best thing to do is to apply about a small amount on your hair and to work it in until evenly distributed. I would not recommend you use this on your bangs. It seems to weigh them down a bit too much. This product did make my hair super shiny - I could see my hair glistening in the sun when I caught a reflection of myself in the window as I was working outside on my patio. So beneath lights or out in the sun it really does make your hair shiny. It seems like there is some glitter in this product which also reflects light well. I&#x27;d say this is probably best for people with thick curly hair or people with thick straight hair that needs taming. If you have fine hair then you have to use very little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> This product works really well on my thick, wavy hair. I rub about a dime size amount between my palms and smooth it onto the lower 1/2 of my hair while it is still damp. This gel formula is thick and can be a little greasy if you overdo it. I would definately recommend NOT using on the roots of your hair as it will weigh hair down. Also if your hair tends to be on the finer side this might not be the best product for you. There are thousands of little silver sparkles suspended in the clear gel formula which I assume helps make the hair shinier and reflect more light. This product makes my hair softer, shinier, and more manageable. I also like the smell of this as well. This product is getting harder to find in my local stores so I was glad to see it here on Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Brunette version since John Frieda discontinued similar product for blonde hair. Since this gloss is transparent, it works very well on hair of any color, gives it shine and smoothness. It&#x27;s never sticky as many other styling products on the market.</li>
    <li> I use this product at least twice a day on my hair.  It helps in styling and gives it a great shine.  Love, love, love it!!!</li>
    <li> I can no longer find this item in my local stores so I am happy to get it online.  It gives my hair a great shine without making it hard like many gels do.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is hard to find in stores. Has been my go-to product for my fine, straight, natural dark brown hair.</li>
    <li> Been using for some while no longer able to find in stores. Use to style hair and give shine</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, can&#x27;t rave about the shine..</li>
    <li> This gives a nice gloss to my hair, I&#x27;ve used it with highlighted, dye and natural hair color, and it works well most of the time. I do think it lightened my hair when it was dyed an auburn color, so you may want to stay away from this product if you sway too far from brunette. The bottle is small, but you don&#x27;t need much so it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received a ton of compliments on how shiny my hair is.  It also helps take the tangles out after I wash my hair.  I always keep a couple tubes at home so I won&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> Have used it previously and always liked the product.</li>
    <li> I love this product have been using it for years.  Makes my hair real shiny and soft, I have recommended it to all my friends.  I ordered from amazon as I am having a real hard time getting it in stores</li>
    <li> My husband is not one for cosmetics but he really likes to use this one.  He has bought many other brands and this is the one he likes.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t do without this product.  It makes my hair much more manageable, with a healthy shine to boost.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year now and love it. I have alot of grey hair that is dryish and this makes it look very healthy!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have curly, frizzy, thin hair, and I finally gave up on keeping it straight.  I use this on dry hair, and it keeps my curls defined without weighing it down.  I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, so thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> The product is good, unfortunately, I found that I&#x27;m allergic to it.</li>
    <li> This was too slick or oily for my hair. I gave it to a friend who has dry hair, she seems to like it.</li>
    <li> love how my hair looks</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, to be honest I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference in my hair. I have naturally curly hair, and used this after flat-ironing. It does help a little with fly-aways, but really didn&#x27;t make my hair glossy or shiny.</li>
    <li> I have course and wavy/curly hair. This works better than any high-end product I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried so many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes my hair smooth, shiny, soft and bouncy. I especially like that it does not weight my hair with long term use like other products seem to do after about a month of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to apply it before I set my hair and I apply a little more once I&#x27;m done styling to add extra shine.</li>
    <li> So sad this is discontinued, but glad I found it here on glamazon!  Bought three to stock up...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adds shine and keeps fly-aways to a minimum without adding weight, light scent.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This product puts a nice sheen on the hair without being greasy looking and helps with the flyaways as well.&lt;br /&gt;Have been using this product for many years.  Good price on Amazon...</li>
    <li> This is the best drugstore category shine serum I&#x27;ve tried. I have repurchased this item because it works well, and smells good.  It&#x27;s hard to describe the fragrance, but the closes I would call it is &amp;#34;warm coconut&amp;#34;, but not in a fruity or tropical way.  I much prefer the fragrance of this to Chi Silk infusion, which smells rather masculine.  I don&#x27;t need to use as much of this product compared to Chi Silk Infusion. and it also doesn&#x27;t gum up the opening of the container when it dries, as Chi Silk Infusion does.</li>
