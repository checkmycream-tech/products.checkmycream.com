### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;Nothing is perfect though...</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>good product.</li>
      <li>So what good was this review?  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say the product didn&#x27;t work, as it wasn&#x27;t a fair test case.  </li>
      <li>Also, not too effective for skin conditions.</li>
      <li>Should be able to give 6 stars</li>
      <li>Will buy again.:-))</li>
      <li>Interesting stuff.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t take more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also tried it on my daughter who gets sores inside her mouth (more like ulcers) but it doesn&#x27;t help with healing those type of sores.</li>
      <li>It is like Magic.</li>
      <li>Way better that swallowing all the pills I would take.  </li>
      <li>I am usually able to use the pills and they work great, but this time it was too much.  </li>
      <li>Arrived quickly, has a nice flavor</li>
      <li>Great product thus far. .</li>
      <li>He doesn&#x27;t mind the taste and takes it easily.  </li>
      <li>I know it&#x27;s early in my own personal testing to say if this product is &#x27;excellent&#x27;</li>
      <li>He also can&#x27;t sallow the lysine pills because they are huge.  </li>
      <li>ordered this from Amazon, it took a week to arrive and was package lightly.  </li>
      <li>I was thinking that perhaps it could be a virus infection, so I took 2 droppers full.</li>
      <li>I took one full drop two times a day in water.</li>
      <li>Works well in combination with Super Lysine Ointment.</li>
      <li>The taste isn&#x27;t very good, but in a small glass of juice, it&#x27;s tolerable and well worth it.</li>
      <li>but so far everything&#x27;s ok.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find available the one I normally get</li>
      <li>This stuff really works!</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I was looking for: an \\&quot;everything and the kitchen sink\\&quot; cocktail of ingredients.</li>
      <li>Not much, sorry.</li>
      <li>and I can hardly taste it which is good.  </li>
      <li>This really works.  </li>
      <li>This absolutely works...Will continue to buy.  </li>
      <li>I have recurrent shingles and this really does seem to get rid of them</li>
      <li>Today is the first day I have had no fever and feel normal.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t damaged but the packaging was only light.  </li>
      <li>Probably effective but cannot get past the smell.</li>
      <li>Would recommend highly.</li>
      <li>I just put a little juice with it in a shot glass makes it better.</li>
      <li>, I ordered over the weekend, was leaving on a trip, so I really couldn&#x27;t give it the old college try.  </li>
      <li>The smell of it is ok, nothing too harsh.  </li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m usually the kind of person who&#x27;s medical motto is &amp;#34;No pain, no gain.&amp;#34; I take NyQuil, Alka Seltzer, and gargle with salt water.</li>
      <li>Finishing out my old bottle.</li>
      <li>was nearly gone by the time the products arrived.  </li>
      <li>All natural.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t been taking for too long but so much easier than the pills.</li>
      <li>Horrendous taste like others stated, but it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re taking shots and swigs of it for social enjoyment.  </li>
      <li>We haven&#x27;t been using long enough to fairly evaluate where it is helping with his cold sores.</li>
      <li>It is amazing stuff as my cold sore never surfaced.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My son has periods of terrible cold sores.  He also can&#x27;t sallow the lysine pills because they are huge.  He doesn&#x27;t mind the taste and takes it easily.  We haven&#x27;t been using long enough to fairly evaluate where it is helping with his cold sores.</li>
    <li> Seems to help.  Horrendous taste like others stated, but it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re taking shots and swigs of it for social enjoyment.  I mixed part of it with Benzyl Alcohol and made a lip treatment similar to Zilactin-L(which is no longer produced).  It helped, but granted my cold sore was nearly gone by the time the products arrived.  I&#x27;ll update IF(&amp;#60;not tempting fate)  I ever get another.</li>
    <li> beats L-lysine tablets. I think, it really made a difference this past winter - my immune system got a boost. I will continue buying it.</li>
    <li> This absolutely works...Will continue to buy.  Would recommend highly.</li>
    <li> Smells really, really bad. Can&#x27;t hide the smell in anything. Probably effective but cannot get past the smell. Not for me.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been taking for too long but so much easier than the pills. Does taste pretty nasty like alcohol with mushroom juice. I just put a little juice with it in a shot glass makes it better.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t smell or taste because I refuse to.  I just put drops in tea or juice.  It is amazing stuff as my cold sore never surfaced.  Way better that swallowing all the pills I would take.  It is like Magic.</li>
    <li> I take a few drops every time I drink coffee or tea.  This keeps the acidity level of my body low.  YEA  I can drink coffee and tea again !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used the capsules of this brand of L Lysine for years. I have recurrent shingles and this really does seem to get rid of them quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used these drops last night, when a stubborn sinusitis had given me a low fever for 2 weeks.  Tried antibiotics, but nothing changed. I was thinking that perhaps it could be a virus infection, so I took 2 droppers full. Today is the first day I have had no fever and feel normal. I am not sure these drops are the reason why, but there does seem to be a connection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will always keep the capsules and these drops on hand for immune system support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is not pleasant, but worth it. Just wash it down with water after squirting them in your mouth.</li>
    <li> Great product. Will buy again.:-))</li>
    <li> took forever to get here!- but this stuff really works for prevention and treating cold sores/viruses</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working! Need I say more😊</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! I take Lysine myself for fever blisters. My granddaughter suffers terribly from them. She is 4 so she can&#x27;t swallow a big pill. I give her 1 dropper  a day in her juice to prevent them. If she does start to have an outbreak I give her 2 droppers. Works well in combination with Super Lysine Ointment.</li>
    <li> Every time I get a cold or flu, I end up with cold sore on my lips. I used to take lysine pills but they are hard to swallow. This was the first time I tried this liquid product when I got flu and did not get a cold sore. That mean it really worked. I took one full drop two times a day in water. I like this product.</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;ve not been sick since I started taking it.....but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because of this product.  I should really get sick and take it and then see how it effects me....right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway.... He&#x27;s my story....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this from Amazon, it took a week to arrive and was package lightly.  It wasn&#x27;t damaged but the packaging was only light.  The bottle is big...IE it&#x27;s 2oz.  I take 2 drops 3 times a day so this bottle will last a long time.  I use a shot glass of orange juice and add 2 drops and I can hardly taste it which is good.  The smell of it is ok, nothing too harsh.  I&#x27;m also taking Oregano in fluid/drop form and I add 1 drop to the 2 of this product to my orange juice.  I&#x27;ve been doing this for 3 weeks now and not been sick and even felt tired.  I don&#x27;t appear to get the mid afternoon &#x27;crash&#x27; at work and start yawning anymore.  I know it&#x27;s early in my own personal testing to say if this product is &#x27;excellent&#x27; but so far everything&#x27;s ok.  I&#x27;ve not been sick, it doesn&#x27;t taste bad, I&#x27;ve had no side effects such as an upset stomach or headaches etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I remember I&#x27;ll update this review in about 6 months.</li>
    <li> This is the nastiest tasting stuff ever!!!!!! I cant bare to take without feeling nauseated.  Wasted my money!!!!!!  Might work but ill never know cause I cant get past the taste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d noticed that the Label was different &amp; instead of mushrooms on the label it has flowers. I didn&#x27;t find available the one I normally get so I ordered this one, especially equal in price &amp; both Lysine.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not yet begun to use this bottle yet. Finishing out my old bottle. So I can&#x27;t say for appx 30 days if it&#x27;s same. I hope it is.!&lt;br /&gt;thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Jada Brown</li>
    <li> Thought it was something you just drank, like cold medicine, it needed to be mixed with water, no big deal, just didn&#x27;t realize.  My condition was too severe, had to go to Dr anyway and get prescription.  I am usually able to use the pills and they work great, but this time it was too much.  I wouldn&#x27;t say the product didn&#x27;t work, as it wasn&#x27;t a fair test case.  I purchased this because to swallow the pills was too painful, took a few days to get, I ordered over the weekend, was leaving on a trip, so I really couldn&#x27;t give it the old college try.  Now that I have it, I&#x27;ll use it next time it flairs up.  So what good was this review?  Not much, sorry.</li>
    <li> This is the worst tasting stuff I have EVER put in my mouth. And I&#x27;m usually the kind of person who&#x27;s medical motto is &amp;#34;No pain, no gain.&amp;#34; I take NyQuil, Alka Seltzer, and gargle with salt water. But this was unbearably awful. Bought it to sneak to my daughter, but after a dab on my tongue, I didn&#x27;t even bother trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, must admit that I cannot speak to the efficacy.</li>
    <li> I use it for cold sores that pop up.  Used under the tongue, it is vile stuff, but if you catch it early it usually stops the blistering.  I swear by it and have been using this brand for 15 years.</li>
    <li> We bought this product because my son often gets cold sores on his lips. When he starts to get a cold sore, I give him a few drops of Lysine in a small glass of juice and after a few doses, the cold sore is already healing. Lysine speeds up the healing process for him! I also tried it on my daughter who gets sores inside her mouth (more like ulcers) but it doesn&#x27;t help with healing those type of sores. The taste isn&#x27;t very good, but in a small glass of juice, it&#x27;s tolerable and well worth it.</li>
    <li> Interesting stuff. This is exactly what I was looking for: an \\&quot;everything and the kitchen sink\\&quot; cocktail of ingredients. After using it for about 3 months this fall, I noticed fewer throat problems that I was prone to (phlegm, shortness of breath, irritation), the cold episode I did get didn&#x27;t last as long and better sense of overall health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste and smell is mostly propolis but not as nasty as pure propolis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems to work for me: Half a dropper in a glass of water is enough for maintenance, two half-droppers (1 morning, 1 evening) when getting sick or around sick co-workers. I won&#x27;t take more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing is perfect though... My GF and I feel nauseous sometimes after taking this. Also, not too effective for skin conditions.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t state it had echinacea in it which I am allergic to. Not happy with what I believe is false advertising.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, has a nice flavor</li>
    <li> good product. Should be able to give 6 stars</li>
    <li> Great product thus far. .</li>
    <li> This really works.  All natural.</li>
    <li> Lysine tablets can cause horrible gas, this is better.  It tastes horrid, but it heals cold sores very quickly.  I squirt it down my throat and then follow with water or juice.</li>
    <li> I buy this for one of my cats, as she will eat this when mixed on her food.</li>
