    <li> I was skeptical of this products authenticity and a little disappointed that container was not full with product (note seller, plse try to give customers full amount of product purchased).&lt;br /&gt;But I must say thus butter is awesome how moisture rich it made my hair look. I put on at nite, root to tip, wrapped hair and then in morning rinse my hair as I do every morning and I luv how my hair felt.  The smooth moisture look and feel remained and my hair dried softer than how it usually does, which is kind of dry tight curls. Oh and that&#x27;s the other best part, it seemed to loosen my curl pattern a little!! I have think natural curly hair recent big chop.</li>
    <li> Loved this product. Smooth to the touch and keeps skin moist for hours! I loved the ease of application as opposed to shea. It works on lips hair and skin, and I used it for all three. I wish I could put it on a continuous order.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on my hair and body and having great results. A must have for anyone wanting to use all natural products.</li>
    <li> Horrible, oily, greasy and the amount that was given is not what was advertised. The butter barely only reaches midway of the jar. The buttter is like vaseline. Doubtful that its,natural...will never buy again.</li>
    <li> the butter is great as a moisturizer for your body and hair. I love using it on my face and my hair.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t research until after I bought this that avocado butter isn&#x27;t an actual pure substance like mango butter, kokum butter, etc. It&#x27;s a whip of basically coconut oil and avocado oil. I could have made that myself basically but this is a nice creamy butter and I&#x27;m liking improvising skin and hair mixes with it nonetheless.</li>
    <li> Another of those things I needed to add to my soap recipes. does everything I needed it to do and wanted.</li>
    <li> Works great in your hair! I learned the hard way not to use too much and completely covered it all...I&#x27;m not sure how many shampoos it took to get it all out! Lol But to mix w other products to make a hair mask or facial, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> I bought this, it&#x27;s good, and the large size of the enclosure, also smelled good, I bought two packs to my mother and her friend and is happy with this product</li>
    <li> The texture of this product is unbelievable!  Moist, smooth, creamy!  I do wish however  that the container was completely packed !</li>
    <li> Not good no organic at all</li>
    <li> See the review I gave for the aloe butter. I comibined this with the other butters and other organic items for a winter body butter.</li>
    <li> It last long, it coats well, thick, and I am ordering more. In fact today . I wish I got more. It was a awesome buy</li>
    <li> With my new line of hair product, this oil is so good for your hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 16 oz avocado butter and received a 16 oz jar that was sent not even half full. It had maybe 7 oz in it. There are also no ingredients listed on the jar and I&#x27;m not sure this is avocado butter as it looks and smells greasy and not like avocado butter at all. I will not be ordering from them again.</li>
    <li> I made a combo butter with this as part of the mix and it mixed great and I use it for my body &amp; hair</li>
    <li> Avocado Butter is a very excellent product to use, when making DIY bath &amp; body products. I LOVE the way it makes the skin feel ❤❤❤</li>
    <li> Great for mixing with other butters and oils.  Used it on my skin and hair.</li>
    <li> like always good butter</li>
    <li> How am I supposed to trust the ingredients in this tub when they are not listed?????? Contact me ASAP with the ingredients.</li>
