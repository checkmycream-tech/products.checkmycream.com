      <li>and the quality is also good,</li>

      <li>I love Dove soap!</li>
      <li>love this and love Amazon for seeming to always have products I cannot find anywhere else!</li>
      <li>This is a pretty good deal but not as good as it looks.  </li>
      <li>and I absolutely Love the fragrance.</li>
      <li>I love &amp;#34;Add</li>
      <li>I love Dove soap and have been using it for years</li>
      <li>I give it as part of a gift package and my friends love it.</li>
      <li>I love the way it feels on my skin</li>
      <li>I love the having it shipped to my home.  </li>
      <li>, the scent, the clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The need more words...</li>
      <li>My mommy buys this because she thinks it&#x27;s better than Ivory.</li>
      <li>Could have bought soap at Costco, and probably received more quantity, but who beats Amazon when it comes to convenience and comfort?</li>
      <li>It smells so fresh and clean, and the value for your money is great.</li>
      <li>She liked it instantly and that is great.</li>
      <li>Works perfectly in my feminine pink bathroom.</li>
      <li>The price seemed fair and Dove is a very reliable soap maker.</li>
      <li>Dove Pink/Rosa is soft on your skin and have a pleasant sent.</li>
      <li>My favorite is the Pink/Rosa, it smells fresh and rinses off easily.</li>
      <li>no need to search it in store and also cheap compare to store.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is worth paying more for it.</li>
      <li>Dove is unique among beauty bars, its moisturizing quality and fragrance make it my favorite.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so rich and creamy.</li>
      <li>Smells devine and leaves skin feeling clean and fresh!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, smells and feels great.</li>
      <li>I tried this soap, since Amazon had a special Prime offer on it, and because I am a faithful user of Dove bar soap.  </li>
      <li>I love this soap so much.</li>
      <li>It has a mild fragrance</li>
      <li>or I started having tremendous dryness....</li>
      <li>The fragrance that comes from these soaps is very vibrant and strong, it certainly smells a lot better than someone before taking a much deserved shower.</li>
      <li>I noticed that the soap I get in a store is fresh and is replaced faster, but when I buy from amazon the soap lasts longer.</li>
      <li>AND it comes right to my door.  </li>
      <li>pink rose anymore</li>
      <li>I love the pink color and it&#x27;s soft clean scent.</li>
      <li>A little of that type of smell is nice but not every time I wash up and</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Unusual for bathroom supply items, but I&#x27;ll take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have tried many soaps...but everything either made my face skin rough</li>
      <li>Thus, I was foolish to purchase a product whose name clearly suggests that men would possibly not find it appealing.  </li>
      <li>True to the original Dove, it leaves the skin feeling  soft and not taut and dry, which is what the claim of 1/4 moisturizer in each bar seems to prove.</li>
      <li>Just wait for the bell to ring and your order is right outside!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very soft and makes me feel refreshed.</li>
      <li>and I also have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I like this soap because it leaves my skin so soft and silky.</li>
      <li>My face feels soft and supple...</li>
      <li>The pink and white foam is so creamy and cool.</li>
      <li>Fresh soap does not last as long as soap the sits in storage.</li>
      <li>I did not particularly care for the fragrance, but I am certain that virtually all women would like it.  </li>
      <li>Nonetheless, the QUALITY of the soap itself was in keeping with the outstanding reputation of all other Dove bar soaps I have tried, and so I feel obligated to award it at least 3 stars, even though I, myself, would likely not order it again.  </li>

<li> I had not seen pink Dove in quite some time and once again Amazon came through.</li>
<li> and this is one of the few soaps I can use.</li>
<li> every time anyone walks past the bathroom.  </li>
<li> A very heavy perfume smell.  </li>
<li> but this is false advertising!</li>
<li> Unfortunately I bought a six pack.  :-(</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Very nice. Had a gift card I needed to use and worked out perfectly. Thanks</li>
    <li> Great smell and leave skin feeling good.</li>
    <li> If you want your body and your entire house to smell like a geriatric hospice center, then this is the bar of soap for you. Whatever room you&#x27;re in and this bar of soap is present it overtakes the room. It&#x27;s so pungent it permeates the wrapping, which is a box covered in plastic. I have to store it in the laundry room because of the stench. I wish I was overreacting but I&#x27;m not. It reaks!</li>
    <li> This is a good deal - nice not to have to go to the store for these products! I can shop with Amazon for all of our household needs.</li>
    <li> Great price for a go-to classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My family still loves Dove for the feel, the scent, the clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The need more words... well, I&#x27;d recommend it, I guess.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good deal but not as good as it looks.  They advertise that these are 4.25 oz bars but what they ship is 4.0 oz bars.  You can buy these locally on sale and use a coupon ad get it cheaper paying tax.  I love Dove soap and have been using it for years but this is false advertising!</li>
    <li> My woman did not like this.</li>
    <li> I love this soap so much. It smells so fresh and clean, and the value for your money is great.</li>
    <li> always a great purchase</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the dove white moisture bar, I&#x27;ve tried the cucumber also but wanted to try this and I absolutely Love the fragrance. It&#x27;s very soft and makes me feel refreshed. I love the way it feels on my skin and I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Happy to have this and the quality is also good,no need to search it in store and also cheap compare to store.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and Dove is a wonderful brand . This product is listed at a great price.</li>
    <li> Best Smelling soap in the world!</li>
    <li> I love Dove soap! This add-on item, when it ships for free and is not taxed, is actually slightly less expensive than my local grocery store AND less than the price at our Walmart AND it comes right to my door.  Unusual for bathroom supply items, but I&#x27;ll take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good job with the add-on item pricing Amazon!</li>
    <li> What a great add on price. Smells devine and leaves skin feeling clean and fresh! I would suggest to a friend.</li>
    <li> Excellent product Iwill buy it again</li>
    <li> Fresh soap does not last as long as soap the sits in storage. I noticed that the soap I get in a store is fresh and is replaced faster, but when I buy from amazon the soap lasts longer. I chalk that up to curing. Just a thought.</li>
    <li> I have used Dove beauty bars for thirty years or longer. My favorite is the Pink/Rosa, it smells fresh and rinses off easily.</li>
    <li> Dove is unique among beauty bars, its moisturizing quality and fragrance make it my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;It is worth paying more for it.</li>
    <li> Bought it for Big Mama, who always requires and prefers bars of soap over liquid versions. She liked it instantly and that is great. Could have bought soap at Costco, and probably received more quantity, but who beats Amazon when it comes to convenience and comfort? Just wait for the bell to ring and your order is right outside! The price seemed fair and Dove is a very reliable soap maker. The fragrance that comes from these soaps is very vibrant and strong, it certainly smells a lot better than someone before taking a much deserved shower. Received a total of 12 bars and Big Mama smells like a pink rosa!</li>
    <li> All we use is dove soap..</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for a while now. The stores no longer sell the Dove  pink rose anymore and I happy I found it. It moisturizes the skin and smells just like roses in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> We use this product all the time.  I love the having it shipped to my home.  Great product and great price!</li>
    <li> I have tried many soaps...but everything either made my face skin rough or I started having tremendous dryness....after I started using dove Rosa.... My face feels soft and supple...its just an awesome feeling.</li>
    <li> Dove Pink/Rosa is soft on your skin and have a pleasant sent. I give it as part of a gift package and my friends love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a soap... What else can I say? It works: you pass it through the body with water and get cleaner... Works like it should.</li>
    <li> I like this soap because it leaves my skin so soft and silky. It has a mild fragrance and I also have sensitive skin and this is one of the few soaps I can use.</li>
    <li> I had not seen pink Dove in quite some time and once again Amazon came through. I love the pink color and it&#x27;s soft clean scent. Works perfectly in my feminine pink bathroom. True to the original Dove, it leaves the skin feeling  soft and not taut and dry, which is what the claim of 1/4 moisturizer in each bar seems to prove. In the months of needing indoor heat it is especially nice to use this on my face as well as a bath soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this and love Amazon for seeming to always have products I cannot find anywhere else!</li>
    <li> Dove soap is so good! I loved this one. It&#x27;s so rich and creamy. It&#x27;s satisfying to rub a bar of rosy pink soap on a tired body, huh? The pink and white foam is so creamy and cool. It never dries up your skin and it leaves you smelling good. This soap makes you smell like a rose, a real rose. My mommy buys this because she thinks it&#x27;s better than Ivory. I think so, too.&lt;br /&gt;Buy your Dove soap now!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, smells and feels great. It lasts a long time and inexpensive to buy.  Thank Dove!</li>
    <li> I tried this soap, since Amazon had a special Prime offer on it, and because I am a faithful user of Dove bar soap.  I did not particularly care for the fragrance, but I am certain that virtually all women would like it.  Thus, I was foolish to purchase a product whose name clearly suggests that men would possibly not find it appealing.  Nonetheless, the QUALITY of the soap itself was in keeping with the outstanding reputation of all other Dove bar soaps I have tried, and so I feel obligated to award it at least 3 stars, even though I, myself, would likely not order it again.  Interestingly, my favorite Dove bar soap is the Revive/Go-Fresh, whose fragrance is more pronounced and spicier-scented than the Pink/Rosa, but which I think both males and females would find delightful.  That variety of Dove soap gets a definite 5-star rating from me.</li>
    <li> A very heavy perfume smell.  The bathroom smells like I have a bunch scented candles burning.  A little of that type of smell is nice but not every time I wash up and every time anyone walks past the bathroom.  Unfortunately I bought a six pack.  :-(</li>
    <li> I love &amp;#34;Add On Items&amp;#34;. This is another great deal on a great product. We have been using this soap for years.</li>
