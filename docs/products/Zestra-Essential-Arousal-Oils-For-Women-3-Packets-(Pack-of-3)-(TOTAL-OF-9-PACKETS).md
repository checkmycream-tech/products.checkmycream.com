<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I tried other products&lt;br /&gt;This works&lt;br /&gt;I use a packet for more than one episode&lt;br /&gt;Enuf said</li>
    <li> My wife and I are very pleased with this product. It has helped her climax each time we have used it, which for her was getting harder since she is postmenopausal. We highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I looked at many reviews about this product and was surprised to read the varying degree of effectiveness expressed by different women/couples.  I have been  using Zestra for the past five years.  Luckily, this product does work for me.  I love it and am very satisfied with it.  I used to be able to buy it at Walgreens, but cannot find it in drugstores or supermarkets.  I have to order it.  I don&#x27;t mind paying the price as long as it works for me, and I guess you just have to take a chance and try it.  Each woman&#x27;s body chemistry is different and obviously if it doesn&#x27;t work you won&#x27;t purchase it again.  I tried many, many products prior to finding Zestra and paid three and four times what I pay for Zestra on other products only to leave a full jar, tube, spray unused and then finally tossed because their ingredients did not work for me.  I am sensitive enough by the ingredients in &amp;#34;Z&amp;#34; that just a tiny drop on the clitoris works.  I end up getting up to three applications from one packet.  You do not need to insert all the oil into the vaginal area; just on the outer lips concentrating it on the clitoris. Obviously if you do not feel aroused after 30 min.  the ingredients in this product does not work with your chemistry.  As for me, 10 min. after application I&#x27;m ready for action. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap to remove the smell from your fingers. The oil does have a petroleum type smell/taste to it, but my husband has not complained about it or been turned off by it because I get very aroused and that&#x27;s worth it to him.  A little tip:  5 min. upon applying &amp;#34;Z&amp;#34;, dab a little honey over the same area as the &amp;#34;Z&amp;#34; (make sure your partner likes the taste of honey or that you or your partner are not allergic to honey) this really helps conceal the unpleasant smell/taste of &amp;#34;Z&amp;#34;, plus the honey is a natural antibiotic, kills bacteria and soothes the vaginal area. Good Luck.</li>
    <li> Great product, my wife has been using for five years now.</li>
    <li> Good product, helps with arousal .</li>
    <li> Burns the skin, but the lady liked that. Smell is 3 stars too. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Dunno why ppl are goin off on this stuff. It&#x27;s greatness! The smell isn&#x27;t fantastic but shoot it makes up for that in other ways ;)</li>
    <li> Zestra is an all natural product. My friend is very about his health and what  he ingests. As for me it&#x27;s a stimulating&lt;br /&gt;product. It really starts the night out on the right level. I&#x27;d like to buy it in a bottle, but I didn&#x27;t see it sold that way on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really do a thing for either of us.&lt;br /&gt;A little messy.&lt;br /&gt;No &amp;#34;additional&amp;#34; effect detected either.</li>
    <li> A good choice for woman looking for a product that is similar to pot.</li>
    <li> GREAT FOR US MATURE WOMEN. LOST A STAR AS IT IS TO EXPENSIVE.</li>
    <li> Excellent effect and acceptable smell.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and service.</li>
    <li> This product is promoted as a feminine arousal product, and it does work for most woman.  But in reality its better function is to deliciously change the viscosity of the vagina.  No matter how good the sex is, a dab of this stuff on the clitoris enhances the experience from both the male and female perspective.  I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews on this stuff; its wonderful.  I don&#x27;t want to have intercourse without it -- and I am a man!</li>
    <li> I bought this with high hopes and was let down enormously... DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY... GO BUY SOMETHING ELSE TO ENHANCE YOUR LOVE LIFE. THIS PRODUCT IS TERRIBLE.</li>
    <li> It smells and had really no positive effect for my girlfriend</li>
    <li> The little foil squares require scissors to open (or very strong fingers.) Contents leak and spill. One was empty so called the company who said it could not be replaced without the sales slip!  The odor was a real turn -off and the effect was no big deal.  I have had more effective enhancers for a fraction of tbe cost with other products. Sorry folks...seemed like a good idea but not so.</li>
    <li> It work very good for us...</li>
    <li> By far the best all natural Arousal product - retaiers are missing out herel</li>
    <li> Very little oil in the package, feels a little warm but nothing spectaular. Nasty taste. Have to apply this prior to lubricant, otherwise won&#x27;t work. Overpriced, will not buy again.</li>
