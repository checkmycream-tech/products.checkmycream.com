### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This time, I got some awesome reactions.</li>
      <li>This blend is great.  </li>
      <li>I honestly would not have ever tried this type of product if I had not already been drawn to this Perfumery because of their excellent custom fragrances.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just thought that the products from the company need some honest feedback from people who have used the product for years, are happy with the products, and are also happy with the level of customer service they have received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a fascinating phero blend - you can almost see that it&#x27;s working by the reactions of the men around you.  </li>
      <li>Loved the idea of this.</li>
      <li>so this is a wonderful light</li>
      <li>This is as good as water.</li>
      <li>it was pretty great!!!</li>
      <li>i smell nice</li>
      <li>; on your skin, then apply a nice cover</li>
      <li>LPMP makes many that are specifically designed to do that, or choose any of your own favorites with the ability to cover.</li>
      <li>but it does have a somewhat strong smell on its own.</li>
      <li>(this is an unscented blend) - most of the reviews on here are from the rewards program over a love potion perfumerie!&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does have a distinct aroma, so you will need to have a good cover</li>
      <li>Men will notice and you will get lots of sexual attention and preferential treatment.  </li>
      <li>I love this one</li>
      <li>and I noticed that many of the comments&lt;br /&gt;although</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to get more.</li>
      <li>I love the LP line of phero blends AND their perfumes</li>
      <li>I used 5 sprays and that has been my magic spot for this one.</li>
      <li>Someone made a comment at me and told me my perfume smells really great and there must be something with my body chemistry and the Perfume.... that he really likes the smell on me..</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more from this company.</li>
      <li>I really love this one, I always get a ton of self-effects</li>
      <li>However, I wore one of the samples that was sent to me and got many, many compliments.  </li>
      <li>Creates a lot of sexual energy.</li>
      <li>the girls are more friendly with u.</li>
      <li>This is surprisingly easy to cover with a perfume.</li>
      <li>But if you want some special sexual attention then you should give this one a try.</li>
      <li>The second day, I got a little more brave with it and covered it with another one of the wonderful samples that was sent.</li>
      <li>I work in s huge company where the majority are men</li>
      <li>Instead it had led to attentive behaviour and interest.</li>
      <li>and I know of many others who have had success with it also.</li>
      <li>The item actually had a nice smell and the samples that came with it were nice.</li>
      <li>This holds true for many loyal customers of LP...</li>
      <li>It adds a sexy, adventurous vibe to our evening and definitely spices up the love life.  </li>
      <li>, I&#x27;d say the first step is trying one through a respectable company.</li>
      <li>They would stop me in the hall and say that my smile was great and that something about me was different.</li>
      <li>This is NO problem as long as you apply a swipe of your favorite Love Potion Scent over the top.  </li>
      <li>there are some people that will not be able to control them selves over you and will keep a really close distance and be touchy...</li>
      <li>Definitely gets results, but need to use a good cover scent.</li>
      <li>Definitely use a good cover-scent with this one.  </li>
      <li>However the samples of the other scents they included smell great, will be ordering some of those just for the smell.</li>
      <li>I have used pheromone products from many different companies, and so many are garbage.</li>
      <li>The men were really helpful with almost everything and seemed more willing to work in a teaming environment with me.</li>
      <li>I will say that I have not bought the product here, through Amazon, but through Love Potion&#x27;s direct website.</li>
      <li>This one works wonders covered by one of the other LovePotion scents, especially a sweet scent.</li>
      <li>purchased &amp; haven&#x27;t noticed very much of a difference beside people commenting</li>
      <li>It does EXACTLY what it claims to do.  </li>
      <li>Firstly, is there any truth to the varied claims?</li>
      <li>It is one of the first pheromone products I have tried, and one I keep returning to over and over.</li>
      <li>Keep in mind however, that it is important to allow this blend appropriate &amp;#34;dry down time&amp;#34</li>
      <li>a soft, clean powdery scent)</li>
      <li>well of course other people gave me a very very special treatment!</li>
      <li>So, the first day, I didn&#x27;t get much reaction.  </li>
      <li>Men are more inclined to talk to you and assist you and they do want to be around you, they linger longer than expected.</li>
      <li>would definitely recommend this to anyone that likes lightly scented perfume.</li>
      <li>Some phero sellers really push some junk</li>
      <li>This one works really really well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still relatively new to the whole pheromone market and I often approach those products with caution.</li>
      <li>your new to the whole idea</li>
      <li>Definitely allow a short dry-down time before getting dressed and wear a favorite perfume with it.</li>
      <li>It is an aggressive blend, not subtle.</li>
      <li>No negative reactions from women.</li>
      <li>Only wear this if you are interested in receiving the attention though.</li>
      <li>For me that place is a small boutique perfumery called Love Potion.</li>
      <li>only reason i&#x27;m giving them 2 stars instead of 1 is because they do offer stellar customer service &amp; plenty of yummy perfume samples with your purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;d</li>
      <li>Once it has dried down, it would be a good idea to use a &amp;#34;cover scent&amp;#34; for it as one should do with any product containing copulins.</li>
      <li>Very intense session, highly recommended, but keep in mind you need to let it dry down first before putting clothes on, and use a scent cover!</li>
      <li>It really works definitely I&#x27;ll buy it again</li>
      <li>Allow for dry down and cover with your favorite fragrance.</li>
      <li>Oh, and the guy that I really like lingered in my office for quite a long time.</li>
      <li>I lurked around on the website&#x27;s message board and learned that you can actually OD on this and get an opposite reaction of what you really want.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Blatant Invitation was the third phero I tried at LPMP and wow, was I surprised.</li>
      <li>probably purchase perfume from them but am not sold on whether pheros really work in general (purchased several from different vendors)</li>
      <li>The label does say Unscented, but that means that it is JUST the pheromone in this blend, no other perfumes or scents, So some of the copulins are detectable to the nose.  </li>
      <li>The first day I wore it, I went a little too soft with it in fear that I might over do it.</li>
      <li>I do have trouble finding the correct amount to apply for consistent results, though.</li>

<li> This is a foolproof pheromone blend so long as you are wanting male attention!</li>
<li> for the person who said the reviews are fake....I can tell you they are ABSOLUTELY NOT.</li>
<li> I read that you should really not wear this to work</li>
<li> I will be careful about wearing it around the office....</li>
<li> Other then that not much to say.</li>
<li> The other poster is correct:  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t get self effects from this one (other than an increase in energy when i wear it to work out)</li>
<li> I took the time to review them as the other poster said</li>
<li> and I usually always get some type of hits from this when I&#x27;m out in public....</li>
<li> I suggest applying the Blatant Invitation first, wait 15 to 20 minutes before getting dressed, THEN generously apply your cover scent.  </li>
<li> any of your other favorited perfumes should work to cover as well.  </li>
<li> Blatant Invitation, when applied alone may go on your skin  a bit loud, but it does dry down after about 20 minutes.</li>
<li> A few times, I could see him blush and get speechless.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> so yes, I&#x27;ve done a few reviews here on Amazon</li>
<li> /&gt;they review the same way and with the same language (and bad English)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I wore it, this past weekend</li>
<li> It does have a bit of an unpleasant scent due to its copulin content, but some of that dissipates upon its drying down.</li>
<li> Every girl needs a secret weapon in her arsenal and Blatant Invitation is among a few I have in mine.  </li>
<li> really disliked that this brand needs to hire people to post fake comments!</li>
<li> don&#x27;t want to send the wrong impression.</li>
<li> Yes, it seems blatantly so.</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> When wearing BI, I don&#x27;t get any self-effects, however, what I do get is lots of stares and looks. I feel like a diva!! This phero blend will help you become Miss popularity among men!</li>
    <li> This blend is great.  It does EXACTLY what it claims to do.  I have used pheromone products from many different companies, and so many are garbage. This is definitely NOT. IT WORKS. It does have a distinct aroma, so you will need to have a good cover scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the person who said the reviews are fake....I can tell you they are ABSOLUTELY NOT. I will say that I have not bought the product here, through Amazon, but through Love Potion&#x27;s direct website. I have been buying from them since 2006, and have never been dissatisfied. I just thought that the products from the company need some honest feedback from people who have used the product for years, are happy with the products, and are also happy with the level of customer service they have received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, you can also see.....these are not the only products I have reviewed, either.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still relatively new to the whole pheromone market and I often approach those products with caution. Firstly, is there any truth to the varied claims? Secondly, what&#x27;s in this? Some phero sellers really push some junk I would not want to put on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;If your new to the whole idea, I&#x27;d say the first step is trying one through a respectable company. For me that place is a small boutique perfumery called Love Potion. I honestly would not have ever tried this type of product if I had not already been drawn to this Perfumery because of their excellent custom fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;Blatant Invitation was the third phero I tried at LPMP and wow, was I surprised. The phero blend with the added dose of couplins make this a head turner and will attract interest of varied degrees. Only wear this if you are interested in receiving the attention though. I would not wear this to work. But a date night with \\&quot;that someone\\&quot; YES!&lt;br /&gt;This is an UnFragranced phero blend but it does have a somewhat strong smell on its own. Definitely allow a short dry-down time before getting dressed and wear a favorite perfume with it.</li>
    <li> This is surprisingly easy to cover with a perfume. I have never found it to cause any creepy or leery behaviour, despite being blatantly inviting. Instead it had led to attentive behaviour and interest. I do have trouble finding the correct amount to apply for consistent results, though.</li>
    <li> I took the time to review them as the other poster said and I noticed that many of the comments&lt;br /&gt;although from different people seem to review almost every &amp;#34;Love Potion Brand&amp;#34; fragrance...&lt;br /&gt;they review the same way and with the same language (and bad English)&lt;br /&gt;I really disliked that this brand needs to hire people to post fake comments!</li>
    <li> I love this one it&#x27;s definitely a keeper! I wear it and then cover it with my Viva La Juicy... Someone made a comment at me and told me my perfume smells really great and there must be something with my body chemistry and the Perfume.... that he really likes the smell on me.. well of course other people gave me a very very special treatment! you just have to watch out coz there are some people that will not be able to control them selves over you and will keep a really close distance and be touchy... taking their chances to feel you! Hahahahah</li>
    <li> If you want guys to give you attention- this phero is for you! It&#x27;s extremely blatant and sexual. It&#x27;s Unscented but does have a smell. Allow for dry down and cover with your favorite fragrance. I almost always get hits while wearing this.!</li>
    <li> purchased &amp; haven&#x27;t noticed very much of a difference beside people commenting i smell nice (this is an unscented blend) - most of the reviews on here are from the rewards program over a love potion perfumerie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only reason i&#x27;m giving them 2 stars instead of 1 is because they do offer stellar customer service &amp; plenty of yummy perfume samples with your purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;d probably purchase perfume from them but am not sold on whether pheros really work in general (purchased several from different vendors)</li>
    <li> If you look at the dates of the reviews you will see that they were all written on the same day, by the same person, in the same time zone. This is as good as water. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> i was worried about what it would smell like, but opening the bottle it reminds me of the smell of baby powder.  I use deodorant that is scented as baby powder so this is a wonderful light fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone that likes lightly scented perfume.</li>
    <li> Loved the idea of this. Have worn it for almost a week with no results. However the samples of the other scents they included smell great, will be ordering some of those just for the smell.</li>
    <li> This one works wonders covered by one of the other LovePotion scents, especially a sweet scent. I applied it to the torso and minutes later my partner was all over me! Very intense session, highly recommended, but keep in mind you need to let it dry down first before putting clothes on, and use a scent cover!</li>
    <li> I work in s huge company where the majority are men n yes this definitely work they go the extra mile with attention for you before i just to be another man but when i wear this they just g o crazy also the girls are more friendly with u. It really works definitely I&#x27;ll buy it again</li>
    <li> Definitely gets results, but need to use a good cover scent. Fruity smells cover this one well. Creates a lot of sexual energy.</li>
    <li> I have this in spray (60%alcohol-40% oil). To my nose it&#x27;s not a stinky phero although others seem to have a different opinion. I don&#x27;t get self effects from this one (other than an increase in energy when i wear it to work out) but i do notice a difference in others. I don&#x27;t have a SO but i have worn outside with caution. Men are more inclined to talk to you and assist you and they do want to be around you, they linger longer than expected. No negative reactions from women.</li>
    <li> This is a foolproof pheromone blend so long as you are wanting male attention! It is one of the first pheromone products I have tried, and one I keep returning to over and over. It is an aggressive blend, not subtle.</li>
    <li> This is a fascinating phero blend - you can almost see that it&#x27;s working by the reactions of the men around you.  Keep in mind however, that it is important to allow this blend appropriate &amp;#34;dry down time&amp;#34; on your skin, then apply a nice cover scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to the reviewer that said these are &#x27;fake&#x27; reviews, nothing could be farther from the truth.  I love the LP line of phero blends AND their perfumes so yes, I&#x27;ve done a few reviews here on Amazon BUT I review LOTS of stuff on Amazon.  This holds true for many loyal customers of LP... their product line and customer service are second-to-none.</li>
    <li> I really love this one, I always get a ton of self-effects and I usually always get some type of hits from this when I&#x27;m out in public....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blatant Invitation works up to its name and then some.  I wore it, this past weekend and as I was chatting with my friends, a gentleman that my friend knew came up and immediately started talking to me after only being at our table for a minute. Three minutes into that conversation another group of folks came over from another table and started chatting with me.&lt;br /&gt;I had folks who have known me for years, talking me up that night like they had not seen me for years... This one works really really well. I used 5 sprays and that has been my magic spot for this one.</li>
    <li> I know you are not supposed to wear this in public unescorted, but I did. If you are shy and need to come out of your shell sexually. Or if you have an inhibited gentleman that you have your sights on then this is the phero you should wear. Men will notice and you will get lots of sexual attention and preferential treatment.  Again, not advising that you wear this alone in public.  But if you want some special sexual attention then you should give this one a try.</li>
    <li> Definitely works on my husband.</li>
    <li> The item actually had a nice smell and the samples that came with it were nice. Other then that not much to say.</li>
    <li> This will bring out the animal in your man!!  Definitely use a good cover-scent with this one.  I suggest applying the Blatant Invitation first, wait 15 to 20 minutes before getting dressed, THEN generously apply your cover scent.  When I wear this with my husband, I am the ONLY woman in the room, no matter where we are.  And, by the way, I ONLY wear this out if he is accompanying me.  I definitely don&#x27;t recommend this for solo outings.</li>
    <li> I have owned BI for a total of two days now. The first day I wore it, I went a little too soft with it in fear that I might over do it. I lurked around on the website&#x27;s message board and learned that you can actually OD on this and get an opposite reaction of what you really want. So, the first day, I didn&#x27;t get much reaction.  However, I wore one of the samples that was sent to me and got many, many compliments.  (Tarot Empress...a soft, clean powdery scent) The second day, I got a little more brave with it and covered it with another one of the wonderful samples that was sent. This time, I got some awesome reactions. Oh...I should mention that I work with nothing but men. I read that you should really not wear this to work but, I did and it was pretty great!!! The men were really helpful with almost everything and seemed more willing to work in a teaming environment with me. They would stop me in the hall and say that my smile was great and that something about me was different. Oh, and the guy that I really like lingered in my office for quite a long time. A few times, I could see him blush and get speechless. So, yeah, I think I&#x27;m hooked. I will be careful about wearing it around the office....don&#x27;t want to send the wrong impression. I wish that I could just target one person with it..the guy I like. I will be ordering more from this company. For work, I&#x27;m going to go with the pheromone based perfumes. I can&#x27;t wait to get more.</li>
    <li> Yes, it invites. Yes, it seems blatantly so. This has worked for me and I know of many others who have had success with it also. It does have a bit of an unpleasant scent due to its copulin content, but some of that dissipates upon its drying down. Allow ample time for it to do that. This will vary from person to person. Once it has dried down, it would be a good idea to use a &amp;#34;cover scent&amp;#34; for it as one should do with any product containing copulins. LPMP makes many that are specifically designed to do that, or choose any of your own favorites with the ability to cover. I have had no problems covering the scent myself.</li>
    <li> Every girl needs a secret weapon in her arsenal and Blatant Invitation is among a few I have in mine.  I like to apply this Pheromone blend when I&#x27;m with my S.O.  It adds a sexy, adventurous vibe to our evening and definitely spices up the love life.  The other poster is correct:  You need a scent to cover this.  The label does say Unscented, but that means that it is JUST the pheromone in this blend, no other perfumes or scents, So some of the copulins are detectable to the nose.  This is NO problem as long as you apply a swipe of your favorite Love Potion Scent over the top.  any of your other favorited perfumes should work to cover as well.  If you&#x27;re in doubt, try at home fist.  Blatant Invitation, when applied alone may go on your skin  a bit loud, but it does dry down after about 20 minutes. Just don&#x27;t get it on hair or clothing, or the scent will stay on them until you wash your hair/clothes.</li>
