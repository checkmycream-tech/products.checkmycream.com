      <li>This soap is amazing.</li>
      <li>Nice smell and size.</li>
      <li>I wish people would research stuff before they perpetuate this kind of nonsense.)</li>
      <li>I asked her what kind of soap was it</li>
      <li>So, I loved it then and still love it now.</li>
      <li>Honestly.</li>
      <li>However, with continued use, it also does a nice job of evening out my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not going to lie at all, being 100% honest ...</li>
      <li>Normally, I have to use my bath brush to get all traces of deodorant from my armpits and today I just used my washcloth and my armpits are perfectly cleaned.</li>

      <li>rash was getting better.</li>
      <li>so we&#x27;ll probably end up buying more.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll probably be better using the Papaya soap to help achieve a more even skin tone.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will be order some more soon.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many acne products.</li>
      <li>I decided to give this a test run, and if it met my expectations, I will order more.</li>

      <li>it leaves brown residue everywhere and has strong smell</li>
      <li>BEST SOAP EVER FOR FADING DARK SPOTS AND EVENING SKIN TONE.</li>
      <li>I ordered this product on the 24th of July and it arrived on August 1, and that&#x27;s good timing considering that I live in the Virgin Islands</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s fine for my oily skin.  </li>
      <li>People, this soap is for everyone, not just black people (do you know how incredibly ignorant that sounds?!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve been impressed with this - been using it for a little over a month.</li>
      <li>The soap actually smells great and makes my face feel as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
      <li>and I have since been rash free.</li>
      <li>In addition, shipping was FREE,</li>
      <li>Within two weeks I found the result I was looking for: even skin tone, prevent blackhead, smooth skin.</li>
      <li>Decided to try it for my skin issues; works great, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>and she told me, that it’s good making your skin soft and clearing up acme scares.</li>
      <li>but right now its more of a cleansing thing.</li>
      <li>It was great on my face, and left it feeling squeaky clean with no residue.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen any difference but it smells good I give it that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie at all, being 100% honest ... I love the smell of this soap, it&#x27;s refreshing. For the first use, you might really feel a weird sensation, but it leaves your skin sooooo soft and smooth, clears up your face from dark spots and etc, I had a cigarette burn on my arm and it cleared up within 3 weeks. Gone. Another advice is to moisturize yourself, I&#x27;d prefer vaseline aloe</li>
    <li> Smells great and lathers well but leaves black stains on bathroom wall. However, the stains can be removed.</li>
    <li> Decided to try it for my skin issues; works great, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this soap it makes your skin so smooth and soft.  I will be order some more soon.</li>
    <li> As soon as I used this soap in the shower, I started feeling itchy everywhere.  I shrugged it off thinking that maybe my skin was just getting used to it. Less than a week later I found dry patches all over my body that burned and itched like crazy.  They went away as soon as I switched back to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, but I know I will not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Love this soap!!  Will buy more!</li>
    <li> Can be a little drying.  I use cold cream mixed with a little baking soda to remove makeup then use this to make sure I&#x27;ve got everything.  Overall, I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This soap saved my skin&lt;br /&gt;I break less frequently and my old dark spots are fading quickly :)</li>
    <li> Heard the hype about this and it didnt live up to my expectations. Didnt dry up my break outs but it does remove all my makeup</li>
    <li> I had a buildup of some kind on the top of my head.  I always felt like I could scrape off some skin under my fingernails.  This soap has reduced this immeasurably!</li>
    <li> I decided to try more natural and herbal products for my face, body and hair. So this is the 1st product Ive purchased on my new \\&quot;natural\\&quot; journey. I ordered Dudu Osun African Black Soap as of last week, this is my first time actually using an organic authentic black soap. I decided to give this a test run, and if it met my expectations, I will order more. I am African American and have alot of scarring from bug bites, playing with my Cane Corso, discoloration and also suffer from seasonal allergies which gives me heat rashes during the spring going into summer and summer going into fall, so Im hoping this will help to tone my skin and help with my skin rashes.  When it arrived, I opened the package, and the smell was amazing. Ive used it twice so far, but wont use it everyday due to the fact that it can dry your skin...but I can already see and feel a major difference in skin. I SIMPLY LOVE IT! My skin hasn&#x27;t felt this cleansed and fresh before. I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because of a friend&#x27;s friend who seemed to have had some great experience with this soap in terms of drying out her pimples. And since I have been suffering from pimples for two months now (which is unlikely), tried several over-the-counter products for my face but seems to have NO effect, I thought trying this product won&#x27;t make it worse than it is.  Long story short, I have been using it for a week now and the redness on my face is gone, bumps on my cheeks are less tender than before so I think it is working. Giving it a full star once I get my desired result. Still have high hopes on this soap or else this would end on a visit with a dermatologist. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited: And it did dry out my pimples!!! :) so 5 stars it is!</li>
    <li> Bye-bye blackheads.  Hello squeeky clean!</li>
    <li> Great soap, great scent. People, this soap is for everyone, not just black people (do you know how incredibly ignorant that sounds?! I wish people would research stuff before they perpetuate this kind of nonsense.) It is called \\&quot;black\\&quot; soap because there are plant ashes in the soap, giving it it&#x27;s dark appearance. It is made from leaves and bark of various trees and plants that are burned in a kettle or vat. The leaves are from banana trees, plantain skins, leaves and bark, palm tree leaves, cocoa pods, shea tree bark, etc. The ashes from the leaves are then mixed with water and then filtered. Oils such as shea butter, coconut oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, and cocoa butter are added to this water to create the soap.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first when ordering this product but in the end I was pleasantly surprised. I was like another reviewer who opened up the package in the living room and was taken back by the smell. I don&#x27;t know what I expected but it want that. After ignoring the soap for a few days I decided to give it a go. I&#x27;m very happy I did. The soap actually smells great and makes my face feel as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
    <li> Wow they don&#x27;t mess around, I just got this today 3 days after ordering and was eager to try this out, I love the smell of this, after lathering myself up and rinsing off it made my skin feel great, I will order this again when this runs out!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle cure, at least not for my spots, but it&#x27;s the only thing that has come close to clearing up my messed up fungasy toes!!! And it makes my skin all glowy, which is always a bonus!</li>
    <li> I read so many great reviews so I was eager to buy it, however it did not clear the discoloration on my face. It left my face clean but it stripped my face of all its natural oils, unfortunately I won&#x27;t buy again. I was really hoping it would work :(</li>
    <li> Thank you for creating this soap. I have tried so many acne products. This soap works it cleared up my skin beautifully.</li>
    <li> Face is looking amazing</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t really help my acne but I think it helped to lighten my acne scars. Leaves your body feeling soft and moisturized. Would recommend for all over body use as it leaves your body feeling great.</li>
    <li> I had a gotten a rash after going outdoors, the doctors could not even cure. I tried expensive creams and medications, nothing worked. Three months I suffered and could not sleep from the horrible rash. I looked online and this soap was something people said would be&lt;br /&gt;a cure. I was skeptical, yet I ordered the soap. Everyday I washed with this soap, and to my amazement in a week&lt;br /&gt;my rash was getting better. My skin was clear next week and I have since been rash free. This product does work and should&lt;br /&gt;be tried out for good skin complexion and rashes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this before. So, I loved it then and still love it now. I do not use it everyday, I use every few days, as it does dry out my skin a bit. However, with continued use, it also does a nice job of evening out my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good soap, for a decent price.</li>
    <li> My skin was dry and ashy all of the time, I hated it. Every time I took a shower I would have to bathe in lots of lotions afterward because my skin would be so dry. I happen to be over my sister house one day when I notice this black bar of soap sitting on her sink. I asked her what kind of soap was it and she told me, that it’s good making your skin soft and clearing up acme scares. She gave me a bar to try, I must say that after using it for two months I do see difference in my skin I’m not ashy anymore, Yea!. Also, I did not have any problems like some people said they did; I will continue to use this product. Oh, i almost forgot I don&#x27;t have to lotion anymore.</li>
    <li> I definitely recommend this product. It&#x27;s a little drying but it&#x27;s fine for my oily skin.  Good if you&#x27;re acne prone.</li>
    <li> This soap lathers very well, and the bar seems to maintain its solid shape without falling apart though I can tell it is on the soft side. It cleans well and rinses easily. I have not found it to be harsh on my skin. I do follow with a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mixed race granddaughter with eczema.  She really loves it and she doesn&#x27;t share!</li>
    <li> Within two weeks I found the result I was looking for: even skin tone, prevent blackhead, smooth skin. It does not change my skin color.</li>
    <li> I have not really seen an improvement in my acne, but the product does smell good (to me) and cleans my face pretty well.</li>
    <li> I have several different skin conditions that leave my skin feeling very rough and dry at times, and most soaps seem to make it worse. I had been wanting to try African black soap for awhile now, mainly due to the fact it&#x27;s all natural. I was a little unsure of how my skin would react as other reviewers stated this soap can be drying, but I finally just decided to give it a try, and I&#x27;m glad that I did! I have only been using this soap for about two weeks now. Within that short time frame, I&#x27;ve noticed my pores have reduced significantly in size, and the black heads on my nose that I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of for at least a year using other skin care products, are GONE! My skin tone does appear to be more even, though I haven&#x27;t really noticed a change in the mild adult acne I have along my forehead. I&#x27;m hoping that will clear up with continued use. Over all it has helped improve my skins texture, and I am very pleased. Though I&#x27;m not sure I will be purchasing this brand again as this is not raw African black soap, and has been processed (the reason for four stars).</li>
    <li> im still using this i havent noticed a difference but its only been a couple of weeks. i bought this for dark marks on my face i still have alot left because i break little pieces off. ive only been using this for a couple of weeks. i will continue to use everday(it doesnt burn anymore) and use the whole bar and i will update my review onces im done or if i start seeing results. but right now its more of a cleansing thing.</li>
    <li> Great soap and the most &amp;#34;lathery&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve ever seen.  Really good for oily skin and one bar lasts a long, long time.</li>
    <li> A lot of people swear by this product. However, i&#x27;m not necessarily one. Although it is GOOD, it&#x27;s not the best thing out there. It didn&#x27;t get rid of my body acne whatsoever.  But the reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars out of 5 is because it did help in getting rid of acne on my face (which i love&amp;#60;3). Also it didn&#x27;t leave my skin dry after using it. In addition to this i did notice my (light-caramel) skin become a little lighter after a bath.. Which is kind of weird but cool lol.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Can&#x27;t beat the price and the delivery was prompt!</li>
    <li> Cannot go wrong with this soap, especially if you are oily and/or acne prone.  I happen to be both and this soap rinses so clean and doesn&#x27;t burn on the skin.  I use witch hazel toner afterwards and my face is soooooo much better now.  I have to watch herbal soaps due to essential oil allergies.  This one is great.</li>
    <li> I honestly purchased this soap for childish reasons.  I bought this soap as a gag gift for my mom because it had &amp;#34;Dudu&amp;#34; in the name and was brown.  It got a few chuckles.  Then she immediately re-gifted it to me.  So I gave it a try.  It is actually very good soap.  It is great for sensitive skin and moisturizing.  The dry skin on my hands was smooth in less than 3 days.  It was great on my face, and left it feeling squeaky clean with no residue.  The only drawback is that it is extremely soft, so it melted away pretty quickly when left on my sink.  It quickly dissolves when sitting on a wet surface (even a slightly wet one).  I ended up using a soap holder with holes that let water drain out.  The second bar lasted probably twice as long doing this.  I plan on buying more.</li>
    <li> Perfect to wash your face 2-3 times a week&lt;br /&gt;Love it! Perfect for oily :) and normal :)skin not to dry! :(</li>
    <li> This soap not only makes you feel clean and fresh but the scent of it makes the whole bathroom smell good.  It was when my husband asked me one day what is that small and he meant it in a good why, that I knew I had to order more.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great as a face wash! I have never been able to use anything except an acne product that has ingredients that I&#x27;m not thrilled with. Now I&#x27;m able to use this in the morning and my acne stuff at night. I have pretty tricky hormonal acne and I&#x27;ve been impressed with this - been using it for a little over a month.</li>
    <li> Soap is highly fragranced to the point that it is annoying and it didn&#x27;t clear up my skin, it actually broke it out! I don&#x27;t know if I had an allergic reaction to the fragrant ingredients, but it is an extremely overpowering scent. I&#x27;ve decided to switch back to Shea Moisture black soap and Nubian Heritage African Black Soap, which have more subdued scents and aided in clearing my acne and complexion.</li>
    <li> This is my second bar. I mainly use it on my face. Does not dry out my skin. I had some light spots from past acme and they are gone. My skin is bright! ( I have an olive completion)</li>
    <li> it foams up really fast so a little goes a long way, it leaves my skin soft and smooth and my acne has been improving!</li>
    <li> This soap didnt really do anything for me unfortunately. I had high hopes bc of the reviews, but no. I threw it in the trash and wouldnt repurchase. Might be just my skin, but it dried my skin out. I swear by manuka honey now for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I love using Dudo Osun black soap, it makes my skin feel very clean without that tight, stripped feeling. Over time, I&#x27;ve noticed that the soap works well for dark spots and blemishes but you must use consistantly.</li>
    <li> I got this soap because I saw really good reviews on it on youtube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Afro Caribbean and have that problematic hyper pigmented skin that runs is my family. I&#x27;ve grown up using skin lightening and toning soaps to help my skin. This soap in comparison to others was not as amazing. It really messy and leaves brown stains EVERY WHERE and is too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll probably be better using the Papaya soap to help achieve a more even skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Shipping was efficient</li>
    <li> I was curious to try this soap because I hear a lot about it but the soap itself really did not do much for me...The scent it kind of strong for me (I guess it just my nose)....My skin also felt kind of weird after using.....It&#x27;s okay....</li>
    <li> I am 35 years old and have dealt with acne most of my adult years. I tried everything from over the counter medicines to infomercials and it would help but only for a little while. I was ready to make an appointment at a dermatologist but someone told me about this soap. I was skeptical but tried it. This soap is amazing. My skin has never looked better. Yes I still have a few very small blemishes but I am not embarrassed of my skin anymore. It does dry your face out, but I just used lotion and that really helped. I noticed a difference right away but it took about a week to see a dramatic difference. I am planning on continuing to buy this. I am beyond impressed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for a couple of years now. The smell is wonderful. It does have a brownish color it leaves behind but it rinses off clean and leaves no residue. This soap is great for many skin problems. I am prone to boils and acne and using this soap I get NONE!!! My mother has skin problems due to her diabetes and its slowly clearing that up as well. Will take the moisture out of your skin if you use it too much so I use it twice a week. Overall love this soap!</li>
    <li> I love the soap, it does it&#x27;s job. It&#x27;ll last longer if you use a loofa or soap saver. It helps with my skin allergies.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a month. I have to evaluate it further</li>
    <li> I have transitioned from proactiv to a less expensive skin care routine to control my acne prone skin. This soap is not only economical but it is very effective. Makes my skin feel so clean! I use this at night to clean my face and then Dickinson&#x27;s witch hazel as a toner and then my medicine from my doctor. I am completely happy with the product!</li>
    <li> was burning my face, maybe its too sensitive...</li>
    <li> This is great for my acne.  It keeps it under control and doesn&#x27;t give me allergic reactions like some of the expensive higher end products.  I will say though that if you suffer from dry skin this may not work for you.  I have combination type skin and if I don&#x27;t use moisturizer my cheeks right under my eyes will start to flake.  But I will be sticking to this product.</li>
    <li> My skin loves black soap. Honestly. I&#x27;m a cancer survivor and I like to use the best products on my skin. Natural products with few additives are my focus. This makes my skin gleam and it doesn&#x27;t feel tight. I just feel like its one of the best soaps that I can use on MY skin. The scent isn&#x27;t all that great but I can live with that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week. I like that it is a natural product but other than that, it isn&#x27;t better or worse than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> cleanses well, great smell, but will stain your shower area and washcloths, just make sure to clean up after it even so often and it doesn&#x27;t cause a problem, I never had a permanent stain even after nor being able to wash after it in a timely fashion whether it&#x27;s because I couldn&#x27;t make it to the laundromat that week or because I was too busy or tired to get to my shower area that day!</li>
    <li> My order was delivered promptly. No complaints there hence the 5/5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap: Nice smell and size. A bit fragrant for those that are sensitive. I have psoriasis on my forehead and this soap lessened the flare ups after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: If you have sensitive skin, pre-rinse your face with cold water. This soap may be a little harsh. Do not leave it on your face more than five minutes!!!! Also, rinse thoroughly! If you leave traces of it on your skin it may irritate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everybody&#x27;s different. This was my experience and I decided to share it with anyone whose interested.</li>
    <li> From reading other reviews on this product I expected more from it. It didn&#x27;t clear up any problems from my skin. It left a residue that was hard to rinse away. It does leave my skin dry. It does smell good.</li>
    <li> It was a bad product and they never responded to me!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the soap for my husband. He has a few acne problems on his face and some eczema on his belly and arms. When he uses it on the eczema, it really dries his skin out but other than that he is a fan of the soap. We keep it out of direct water in the shower so it doesn&#x27;t dissolve away quickly.</li>
    <li> Make my skin feel great....downside...it leaves brown residue everywhere and has strong smell</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT.....</li>
    <li> Lovely! I use this soap along with another vanilla soap. Didn&#x27;t create any negative reactions- although others are right in warning not to scrub harshly.</li>
    <li> This soap smells so good! And the shipping was super fast.</li>
    <li> BEST SOAP EVER FOR FADING DARK SPOTS AND EVENING SKIN TONE. I swear this is the best soap ever. Makes my face feel squeaky clean and lightens my acne scars. Also reduces acne [I only get mild breakouts]. The smell isn&#x27;t too bad to me, but this could be because I&#x27;m Nigerian and I&#x27;m used to the smell of home lol. But I would definitely use it. Also works pretty well on clearing eczema.</li>
    <li> helps clear up my acne! love it!</li>
    <li> I have been fighting acne for about a year and I used everything!!! So my boyfriend recommended that I try this.....well I did and although it leaves my face extremely dry my skin eventually got used to it........  however I put a moisturizer on at night after I wash my face when I go to bed.....will recommend !!!</li>
    <li> I got this hoping it would treat my acne. It was horrible and dried my skin out. My acne did not improve at all. Disappointed</li>
    <li> excellent product!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Shipping: I ordered this product on the 24th of July and it arrived on August 1, and that&#x27;s good timing considering that I live in the Virgin Islands and it appears most sellers act like that&#x27;s in the jungle. In addition, shipping was FREE, oh I love free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Scent: The Dudu Osun African Black Soap has a good scent.&lt;br /&gt;Product size: It is a standard size soap, like the size of the DOVE bar.&lt;br /&gt;First Use: Well today is the first and I used the soap and I feel CLEAN. It lathers well and a little goes a long way. Normally, I have to use my bath brush to get all traces of deodorant from my armpits and today I just used my washcloth and my armpits are perfectly cleaned. Thus far I don&#x27;t have any weird skin irritations to report. I even use it on my hair, I don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone because the product didn&#x27;t say it was for hair. I just washed my hair with it because I test everything for future reviews. After this bar is finished, I will come back and let you know if I got any negative or positive reaction from the use on my body and my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I give this product 5 stars, especially since the shipping was FREE.</li>
    <li> Working great for my sons acne. It  irritated my skin, cleared up my acne. Jt made my skin peel and itchy amd then my forehead started to break out. I THINK THIS WORKS WELL FOR SOME OTHERS IT DON&#x27;T!</li>
    <li> I ordered this soap for my boyfriend after reading a friend&#x27;s post on FB about how well it worked on her face and body acne. We&#x27;ve only had the soap for a week so we haven&#x27;t seen much change in his skin but he seems to like how his skin feels after using it so we&#x27;ll probably end up buying more. It has a great smell too!</li>
    <li> I was a little worried about the scent after a friend described it as smelling &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34;, which for some reason made me think of the smell of dirt and soil. I was pleasantly surprised however that wasn&#x27;t the case at all, it actually smells very fresh and clean. Hard to describe, but to my nose it smells slightly like green apple/orchard/garden/soapy. It lathers quite well and leaves my skin squeaky clean and soft.</li>
    <li> I love this product; however, you will need to find a moisturizer to use with it after because it makes my face kind of dry.</li>
