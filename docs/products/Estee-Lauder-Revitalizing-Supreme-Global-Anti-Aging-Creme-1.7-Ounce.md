    <li> This is perfect for winter skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent facial moisturizer. Been using it for 1 year and I really like the results. Non greasy and even feels good going on. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The cream is thick ( I hope it&#x27;s full of good things!) but not greasy, smells nice and absorbs fast. I use it on top of Serum as recommended. Feels great.</li>
    <li> great product, does what it says and seller got product as listed and fast</li>
    <li> I have never had such an amazing skin care product.  My skin feels amazing, soft, and even hydrated (all day long).  The price is so much better here on amazon than buying at Dillards for $90.00.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Purchased @ Neiman Marcus by recommendation from sales associate.  Very little is needed to moisturize and nourish skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and the best price i could find was on Amazon.  The texture is different from most creams and feels very moisturizing wehn you apply it.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product !!! Worth the investment :)</li>
    <li> After a month of use, no real difference to speak of. Disappointed .</li>
    <li> Best night cream and very moisturizing !  My skin has never looked better..</li>
    <li> Great product. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I really like this product and have noticed a difference in my skin. I used oil of Olay products for years and switched to this after my mom and sister let me try their sample.&lt;br /&gt;I was hooked.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is not as dull as before, a bit more even toned, and seems to be smoother and softer.&lt;br /&gt;  It has worked for me!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive and combination skin. I&#x27;ve used up 6 bottles, of size of mixing 1 oz and 1.7 oz. And there  were small bumps around the jaw area from time to time. After using this cream, my face gets rid of those bumps and it gets obviously smoother.&lt;br /&gt;For a skin which has minor issue (like the sporadic bumps), this product stabilize the skin but doesn&#x27;t do anything dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;For a skin which is usually stable but gets into problem for some reason (suddenly allergic or menstrual acne), this product dramatically help recover the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I can wear this under makeup too.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot comment on the effect of smoothing out the fine lines because I don&#x27;t have a severe line problem.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot comment either on the effect of firming the skin.&lt;br /&gt;One thing to notice is that only wearing this in a heated room in winter is not sufficient to resist an hour.. And wearing this along cannot resist even non-heated room overnight.&lt;br /&gt;If you are seeking for a cream for early aging skin, and help irregular allergic problem or acne, you could try this.&lt;br /&gt;But in heated indoor, I recommend toning your skin before wearing this to get enough moisture, and wearing a oil-based cream after this to secure the moisture in your skin.</li>
    <li> I just used a free sample I got and I am amazed at the difference! Have never noticed a difference before with eye cream. this was instant and still going into nxt morning. Will be purchasing</li>
    <li> Great and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I noticed a difference immediately</li>
    <li> Hydrating and absorbing well, but gel like texture made me use it up pretty fast.</li>
    <li> This makes your face feel great.  I really like it</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Expensive but worth it. Works better than any moisturizer I have used.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive eyes and using this product caused my eyes discomfort.  I am sure it is a good product but not for me</li>
    <li> WOW! Miracle in a jar! Does not make my face feel greasy and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores!! Acne is actually cleared up. My skin feels like &amp;#34;velvet&amp;#34; after applying. Fine lines seem to be diminished. Very impressed and have made this part of my skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> Good. My mom likes it.</li>
    <li> This product does not need of presentation. Really good product, even for men considering it is odorless and not greasy. I will buy again this product.</li>
