<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The colors in this palette are very pigmented and there is every color that you need! Great buy for the price!</li>
    <li> Not one eyeshadow pod was broken.  the colors are beautiful.  There are so many choices to chose from.  I love this cant wait to purchase more.</li>
    <li> Well, one was broken but i live in another country so i guess it was a shipping problem. Anyway i really love them and the colors are amazing. I have not wailings, i think the price is great and also the product.</li>
    <li> So many colors, great package and very pigmented. Great quality. I love makeup and am very conscious about how the quality is, its great. Take me forever to use all the colors :)</li>
    <li> Like all the colors, goes with all my clothing. Also like that the colors have a lot of pigment so they actually show up.</li>
    <li> The pallette met my expectations. The colors go on smoothly and bright. The only thing is getting the white to show however I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find a solution.</li>
    <li> i loved that there are alot of vibrant colors.  They very pigmented how ever the colors on your eyelid tend to crease after a few hours.  otherwise i would have given it a 5 star.  overall i really liked these eyeshadows.</li>
    <li> i was hesitant at first about buying this palette but i was trying to stray away from always buying individual shades. This makeup palette is very vibrant, colorful, and worth it. If you want the colors to really pop use an eye shadow base such as Nyx eye shadow base in white and/or nyx jumble eye pencil in milk. i use urban decay eye primer on my lid so the colors don&#x27;t crease. will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! There are so many colors to choose from! At first, I was a bit skeptical because I hadn&#x27;t ever heard of bhcosmetics. Also generally from my experience, larger palettes do not have the greatest of quality. After doing a bit of research, I found a couple of youtube videos of people using this eyeshadow &amp; I was convinced! Anyways, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this palette.. I&#x27;m focusing on becoming a MUA When I came accross this palette I was actually a little fishy about buying the product at first I didn&#x27;t believe the colors were really bright and pigmented.. When I received my Palette it got shipped in 2 days which I loved and there&#x27;s so many colors to use I JUST LOVE IT!. Ever since I posted a picture of my palette on FB Girls have been asking me where did I get I recommend BH cosmetics to all of them the services are great and so is their product. I now have 3 palettes (:, Hopefully later on in the future I can purchase more palettes from them but I mos def recommend this companys product. THUMBS UP (; Hopefullly I can post up a picture to show you girls how good they are.</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas gift for a good friend who lives far fromme.  She LOVES it, says there are colors for every occasion.  She loves it so much, I just ordered one for myself, and I am an eyeshadow snob. I can&#x27;t wait to try it for myself!</li>
    <li> I wanted this palette for quite a while and finally ordered it. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get it. When I got it (this morning) I was so disappointed. Not only was the case broken (a hinge), but the darkest color (looks like dark charcoal) on the bottom palette was completely crushed to powder and it was ALL over the rest of the palette. What a mess it is. Trying to swatch some of the eyeshadows, thinking I can brush off the whole palette a few times to try to clean it, I discovered how powdery and how much fallout there is from the shadows. UGH.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this palette! Most of the shadows are super pigmented, and the ones that aren&#x27;t are probably meant to be highlighting colors, so they don&#x27;t have to be. They apply smoothly with a brush, and they blend extremely well! I&#x27;m an amateur at makeup, and normally not too daring with my eyeshadow choices, but I went crazy with color when I got this palette and created two super dramatic looks that could have been done by a professional! Free shipping was a plus, and it even arrived a day earlier than expected. The only downside is that one shadow came kind of broken, but it was only a couple of pieces that came apart, so pretty good packaging-wise. I may be buying other editions of this palette in the future...but only after I&#x27;m done playing with this one, first!</li>
    <li> I bought this palette because I needed a lot of colors, and the professionals brand where too expensive. I checked a lot of reviews on youtube and this seemed to be the better one, and they werent wrong. This palette 120 colors, I havent try them all, but the one that I have used are very bright colors and they stay in place. Im really happy about this. the only thing is that it dosent have a lot of neutral colors, most of them are glittery or shinny. For that I would have to use a neutral palette.</li>
    <li> Love this! The colors are gorgeous and the quality is amazing shipping was extremely fast. This palette is a very pigmented comes with a variety of colors so you can create many different books I highly recommend BH cosmetics in general they have awesome high-quality products for an affordable price.</li>
    <li> The quality of this product was so well made. I love everything about this eyeshadow palette and could not be more satisfied with all of the beautiful colors provided.</li>
    <li> Not a single shadow broken..the colors are very pigmented.and theres a large variety of matte and shimmery shadows. Love it! Id def purchase again!</li>
    <li> I loved it and the colors are amazing its worth buying none of shadows were broken it was well package its amazing you should buy it don&#x27;t think about so much its the best decision u will make today.</li>
    <li> I thought that the price was a reference to the quality of this product but I was wrong, I don&#x27;t know what I expected but it surprised me how much I liked it from the moment I opened that neatly packaged box. The colors in this palette are simply amazing, is not only the different hues (120 of them!) but the pigmentation it&#x27;s top quality and it also has a nice combination of matte and shimmery colors, I had to love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27; am very happy with this product. High quality althoug i expacted a Mac product! I&#x27;am using the eyeshadow, lovely colours.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a photographer and I needed this kit for my models. I&#x27;m not a make-up artist but I know good quality make-up when I use it. I honestly thought this was going to be crappy eyeshadow, but I was absolutely wrong. This eyeshadow kit went above and beyond. I not only use it for photo shoots but I use it on a daily basis for myself. It has all the solid colors and the shimmery colors one could think of. Try and think of a color that isn&#x27;t in this kit. You can&#x27;t. The shipping was great, it was packaged very nicely and came within a few days. I&#x27;ve recommended this to many of my friends, some models, some photographer, and some cosmetology students and they&#x27;ve all had nothing but great reviews. The only thing I will say, is this, if you do not have a good make-up brush set, this eyeshadow kit will be worthless to you. If you don&#x27;t have the right tools it won&#x27;t work. But good news is, there&#x27;s an awesome brush set here on amazon for like 15 dollars, if I remember correctly, and its a perfect match. With that it&#x27;s totally worth the money and it&#x27;ll last awhile, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeshadows, they are colorful, bright, and this palette is all you need. Applying an eyeshadow primer is what I recommend so the color pops up even more and it will last longer.  Most of the people I know has complimented my eyeshadows, my sisters in law and mother in law have their own palette since they liked mine so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping is really fast. I ordered mine on a Tuesday and by Thursday they were in my door.</li>
    <li> I bought this yesterday, yes YESTERDAY and it was waiting for me at my door when I got home from work! Nice surprise! The box was well packed and my pallet made it to me completely unharmed. All the shadows are in wonderful condition and the color payoff is fantastic! I&#x27;ve been wanting this pallet for a long time now and decided to pull the trigger. Very glad I did. It&#x27;s perfect for neutral looks as well as outlandish fun looks! I&#x27;m very excited!</li>
    <li> This was shipped very well. Nothing was broken. The case measures around 9 inches by 6 inches. The eyeshadows are about the size of a dime. But there are so many colors thats really all you need. There is a nice closure on the lid of the case so it wont come open. There is a full color range, blues, yellows, greens, purples, reds, pinks, metallics, neutrals, mattes, shimmers, glitters. The eyeshadows are very bright and the pigmentation is great. Only takes a little tap to get all the color you need. I was skeptical because there were only two reviews, but I&#x27;m so glad I bought it! The packaging is great on it, it was wrapped in bubble wrap inside the product box, wrapped in bubble wrap outside of it, and this laid in the middle of paper for cushioning. Thank you BHcosmetics!</li>
    <li> The palette was delivered safely bubble-wrapped, so nothing was broken.  I looked at the casing, and much to my dismay, the first ingredient is Talc.  The second ingredient?  Mica.  These are terrible, cheap ingredients that have been linked to cancer, so I&#x27;m not sure if this palette was worth the price.  The colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant as in the picture, and they&#x27;re pretty much all mattes.  The ones that are supposed to be shiny barely even throw a sparkle.  The packaging was all right.  I don&#x27;t really like the way the two halves are stacked on top of each other.  It would have been nice if they stuck to the two panels, or if it were easier to hold them without having to touch the shadows.</li>
    <li> Awesome quality in the pigments. Love every single color.  Had some problems with the packing but I contact the company and they solved the problem right away.  Great experience and I would definitely buy more products from them.</li>
    <li> I placed my order yesterday afternoon and received it today.....UNBELIEVABLE!!!!! The product was WELL packaged and not a single pallet was broken or out of place. I love the range of colors, they are nicely pigmented and the colors are BEAUTIFUL. I am sooooooo excited to begin doing makeup!! I am so glad i chose this company over the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU SO MUCH Bhcosmetics for your wonderful service, your dedication to great customer service will keep you around for ever!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/12/11- update love most of the colors some I didn&#x27;t find use for and others i just haven&#x27;t gotten to, I found a liking for the shimmer colors so I plan to buy the metallic kit.There are colors I may never use due to the tone of my beautiful chocolate skin but I have many that I love that the few I wont use dont matter.</li>
    <li> I saw several videos recommending these palettes and finally decided to purchase them. I couldn&#x27;t decide on 1st or 2nd Edition, so I splurged and bought both! I ordered them on a Saturday and they were at my house by Tuesday ~ super fast shipping! I&#x27;m amazed at the colors, they are just so vibrant and are almost TOO gorgeous, I had a hard time actually using it at first! I would highly recommend either palette to anyone, it&#x27;s such a good price compared to single eye shadows! I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I bought this palette for my sister(21) as a gift. She was so ecstatic! She wouldn&#x27;t stop talking about it and she just kept staring at it{mesmerized}. She did complain that one of the colors was broken up. She already had one not from bh, I think it was coastal and she instantly gave it to the younger sister. I think I&#x27;ll buy one for myself.</li>
    <li> I have an Amazon Prime account, so I have free 2-day shipping, which is what I opted for. (who wouldn&#x27;t? it&#x27;s free and it gets to you faster!) I know the most common complaint about these palettes is due to poor shipping, causing the palettes to be broken, colors to be crumbled, and colors to be mixed. The reason I chose this particular palette from Amazon, is because it had the best written reviews related to condition of the product upon receipt. I&#x27;m not sure if there is better luck by ordering it directly from BHcosmetics.com, but as far as I&#x27;ve read, most people seem to receive the product in wonderful condition. My biggest complaint is the condition of the case, not the colors (you can fix the colors, it just takes some patience and a dime). My case does not close, due to the fact that the plastic and the metal pins that form the hinge are broken. What good is a palette that won&#x27;t close? The entire point of having a palette is to have everything compact and easy to store, and easy to travel! I&#x27;m very disappointed in the packing of the product, and for this to be such a common issue, it really needs to be fixed. I did have three colors that were crumbled, infecting surrounding colors with pink and green on the top layer, and one red crumbled on the bottom later, but it remained in its own pot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I&#x27;m going to try out the colors and see how the colors hold up. Going by product reviews I read, it seems to be an amazing palette, and the colors seem to be very high quality. So, despite the horrid condition of the packing and my palette itself, I&#x27;m so excited to try out the colors!</li>
    <li> BH cosmetic kits are great and inexpensive way to travel easy with all your colors to photo shoots they are lightweight and compact with a profession look to them. I also have their brush set and i was impressed with the quality you get for this price.</li>
    <li> i use it almost everyday, And with so many colors to choose from its great</li>
    <li> Thank you!!! I received my package within a few days. It was totally secured. I heard horror stories about others who ordered makeup palettes similar to the Bh 120 eyeshadow palettes from another company and when they received their palette some of the colors were broken. I received my palette in excellent condition!!! I appreciate the extra effort in packing the products for safe delivery. I plan on ordering the neutral and shimmer palettes soon.  I plan on ordering some for Christmas gifts too!    Thank you BH Cosmetics!!</li>
    <li> it came two days after ordering, it was wrapped up and packed really nice, and everything was all together !colors are beautiful</li>
    <li> So I Just Got My Palette in the mail today and i am really content with it. The colors are Nicely Pigmented nothing was broken and it came earlier than the estimated date. I Cant waite to Play with it more. I Definitly Recommend This palette it has great colors that will last you. all you need is alittle bit on your brush, im definitly gonna buy more makeup from BHcosmetics</li>
    <li> The colors are so bright and vivid, I love it! I just got it in today, it got here in about 4 days, which is pretty fast. The only reason I&#x27;m giving this four stars is because one of the eyeshadows on the bottom was broken, but it was a pinky-orange. It still can be used because it wasn&#x27;t broken into complete dust. I will be buying more, thank you!</li>
    <li> when i saw this i thought that this would be the perfect gift for my best friend for x-mas and it is none of the colors were cracked it is in perfect condition! the colors are great and came fast great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this palette a few times now for doing my anime make-up for cosplay.  I am a black person with a rich brown skin tone, and the bright colors show up even on me.  The colors turned out really nice in my photo shoot as well.  I highly recommend.  I found out about BH cosmetics through this lady on Youtube who does phenomenal make-up, DestinyGodley.</li>
    <li> As a true makeup addict-this is by far one of my favorite palletes EVER!! The colors are so rich and thick!</li>
    <li> I love this palette and have been wanting this for awhile. I ordered it on a Saturday and received it on Monday even though they said it wouldn&#x27;t be here until Tuesday so I was super excited to be receiving it sooner. It was packaged really well although two colors were broken (the black and the aqua)there&#x27;s still a large amount of those colors left though it was only the top of it that was damaged. I&#x27;m still so happy and recommend this product to everyone. Amazaon.com &amp;BH cosmetics are the best ever... :)    If you are unsure or skeptical just go for it you will not be disappointed at all. It&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
    <li> Even though this palette took a long time to ship, I must say that this is one of the best products out there. Mainly because it offers a wide variety of colors in a compact, slim case, which is great. It has a great mix of neutral and standard colors, as well as bright, eye-catching colors. I can&#x27;t wait until summer and spring so I can really use all the colors and have fun with it. Also, all the colors are very pretty and pigmented and I just can&#x27;t get enough of it!!</li>
    <li> This palette has every color you&#x27;d want. It&#x27;s highly pigmented, and lasts. i love mixing colors, or lining my lids with a bright color that matches my outfit, while keeping most of the shadow neutral. Go big and bold, or nicely neutral. Not for use with travel unless you have a huge makeup bag. All of the colors arrived completely intact. This was also perfect for my daughter who is learning cosmetology. You can&#x27;t beat the price for this quality</li>
    <li> The colors are highly pigmented.  For ultimate results use with a eyelid primer.  The color will last all day.  The array of colors are essential for all the upcoming spring colors.  I always love ordering products from Amazon, they are always delivered quickly and the products are wrapped well.</li>
    <li> This was definitely a good buy and well worth the money! I love this palette. The shades are beautiful. I have a honey, golden brown skin tone and the shades go on wonderfully! Can I say again, I love this product! The case is beautiful and provides a great way to travel with my makeup!!</li>
    <li> Hello all, I bought this palette for my girlfriend, she loves make up and knows a lot about it. When she saw a palette with 120 colors, she was crazy! :)&lt;br /&gt;She told me that this product is excellent! She loved, and I will bought another in soon! I really recommend you to buying it for 2 important things: Price and Quality!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! It was all intact when I opened it. The colors are well pigmented! You definitely get the bang for your buck!</li>
    <li> I received the three BH eye shadow pallettes. I&#x27;d ordered 1st, 2nd and 3rd edition pallettes and I was more than excited to be receiving them and as I opened the 1st one I saw that I&#x27;d had 3 broken eyeshadows on top and on the bottom I had 4 broken the second box I began praying that it would be better to find the same on top and on the bottom and at this point I was just eager to open the last one and found that the condition of that one was no better I was furious because my decision on ordering these was not easily decided upon but never the less the colors were soooooo beautiful so that made me all the more uppset. Anyway I did get things put through to return the items. If I had received the make up in tact I would surely give it  a  5 but since it was all broken up I give it a 3 the packaging gets a 2 for effort but after the bubble wrap in the product box being wrapped all nice they had just put in a brown package box and sent off. I am going to try this thing again though and I hope all my make up is in tact with not one thing broken.</li>
    <li> I am now ordering another I love it soooo much. Colors are extremely vibrant!</li>
    <li> Ok. I love make up world, even though i&#x27;ll be a nurse soon, i try a lot of products and i choose which is the best for me...120 eyeshadow palette and just for $20 something...and you don&#x27;t have it yet...well let me tell you something...if you don&#x27;t bye this palette, you do not have the right eyeshadow on your eyes. 120 colors, a mixture with mat and shimmery eyeshadow, both last 24 hours on your eyes...and it is so cheap you will not believe it...run e buy it...you will have the rainbow on your palette...</li>
    <li> I love this eye shadow. It has a variety of colors and stays on pretty well. I have ordered 2 so far.</li>
    <li> This palette has all matte, glitter eye shadow. there are strong colors and a big variety :)I LOVE this palette, yes maybe, a MAC palette is better but for the price? It rocks :D</li>
    <li> I love it, the eye shadows are super pigmented really nice colors very vibrant and a good verity of colors to pick out a lot of diffrent color shades.</li>
    <li> I bought this a week ago and I recieved it yesterday. I immediately opened it up. I was afraid that my makeup would come with broken eye shadows but the packaging was great. There was bubble wrap inside the box. The colors in real life look a little darker than in some photos. I only used a few of the colors but I am very happy. I want to order a base primer to really bring out the colors. Overall I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this palette! It came wrapped so well and nothing was out of place. The colors are FAB and I&#x27;ve been using them for 4 months now. It&#x27;s ALL I use! No other palette can compare! I bought 3 for my girlfriends!</li>
    <li> I liked all the color it has, is very nice to have all of them together in only one case. I was wooried about receiving the eyeshows colors broken because of the shipping, and I received them intact, but surprigsinly, the cover of the case came broken in one of its corners, what a shame, I didnt worry but I think this problem is related to the manufacturing of the product.</li>
    <li> WOW, never had so many different colors of eye shadows before! This is a value product! Good price with good quality, I definately love the colours!!! It&#x27;s just that I was a tiny bit dissapointed with the size, I thought the \\&quot;circles\\&quot; were bigger.But other than that, it&#x27;s all perfect. Well may be if they added more a mirrior.</li>
    <li> I was toying with the idea of buying this for a couple weeks before I ended up breaking down and ordering it, and I have to say I don&#x27;t regret that decision at all! It is a great little palette. I was definitely worried about the quality because it was so cheap, but it has surprisingly good quality. Now, this is WITH a primer/base. Without those a lot of the colors don&#x27;t show up too well, and that is why I took away a star. However, with a primer/base (I personally use the Urban Decay Primer potion and the NYX eyeshadow base in white), these colors have an amazing pop.   This palette is so versatile because get so many different colors to choose from so the combinations are endless. Not only can you go with a bright bold eye, you can also do a neutral eye with the colors that are in this palette. One thing to mention is that the pans are pretty small (about the size of a dime), but you don&#x27;t need much of the product so even though the pans are small, they should last a while.  Bottom line, if you love having a bunch of different eyeshadow options or if you are new to makeup and want to learn about how to use eyeshadow and the different colors, this is a must-buy palette. Be aware that there are NO brushes that come with this palette.  Pros:  -WITH a primer/base, the colors are very pigmented  -Very affordable for pretty good quality product  -Endless color combination possibilities  -Cute compact case. Great size, especially for traveling!  -GREAT shipping! It was fast and they packed the box well to protect the product. There were no broken shadows when I opened it.  Cons:  -WITHOUT primer/base the pigmentation isn&#x27;t too good with a lot of the colors.  -There are parabens in this which is an very common preservative used in cosmetics/lotion but still best to limit the exposure to them  -There is some fallout, especially with the matte colors.  **WARNING: If you are not careful lifting up the first tray, it can be a little tricky getting it out so when you do pop itout don&#x27;t be too forceful with it because it could fling right out of your hands and end up on the floor.</li>
    <li> I am a dancer, and I need heavily pigmented, long lasting shadows that won&#x27;t fade or sweat off, and I&#x27;ve found that in the BH palettes. You really only need a sweep of the brush across the pan to get enough shadow for both eyes. The colors are true, intense, and blend extremely well. I LOVE this palette!</li>
    <li> This product is really affordable and of good quality. I loved it so much I bought another one for my sister. Very bright colors, stay on perfect! Definitely would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I gave it 3 stars because the packaging was very disappointing. My palette&#x27;s lid seems as if it&#x27;s about to snap right out since part of it came in broken. Plus, 2 of my colors came in smashed &amp; about 6 of the colors came out of the palette. So I super-glued them right back into place. The colors are pretty pigmented;although they weren&#x27;t as pigmented as I hoped it&#x27;d be. You would definitely need a Eye Shadow Primer to keep them in place if you&#x27;re planning to wear it throughout the day, or a cream eye shadow should do. If not, the colors won&#x27;t stay on your eyes very long at all. Either way, it&#x27;s a decent palette. I recommend it to those who aren&#x27;t looking to buy expensive cosmetics &amp; if you wouldn&#x27;t mind having to re-touch it here &amp; there;but, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m willing to repurchase since this is the 2nd time it&#x27;s happened to me.    *I would like to say to BH Cosmetics that they need to make sure the packaging is done better. It needs more cushion &amp; as well as a &#x27;fragile&#x27; sticker on the outside of the package. This way the palette won&#x27;t come in distorted.</li>
    <li> I like this palette a lot. The colors are vibrant and they&#x27;re not too wild. I like the gradient of colors they provide. They are easy to pick up on your brush. But the staying power isn&#x27;t so great if you use it alone. Primer is very important here. This is great it is a steal. Amazon had a better offer than the company this product originates from. The only real problem there is with this is the mattes... haven&#x27;t come across any really. Even though they&#x27;re supposed to be in this palette. A serious problem is that there is no flat black in this palette... at all. There is a gorgeous sparkly black, but no flat black. Which is a problem because since there are so many colors in this palette, you&#x27;d expect it to be a \\&quot;all you need\\&quot; deal. But this is not true. Not enough flat matte colors, no flat black. But this is still a great deal. If you choose to buy it... which you should.. I advise you to invest in an eyeshadow primer for longevity and if you wanna go the extra mile, purchase a setting spray too.</li>
    <li> these eyeshadows are very pigmented, last a good while, good buy.</li>
    <li> I honestly bought this because I wanted red shadow.  Red shadow is very hard to find and I love the pigment and color payoff I have come to expect from BH Cosmetics</li>
    <li> My daughter loves her eyeshadows.  She loves all the colors and all of the variety there is to choose from.  She said they are all nice and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to show enough color. Great</li>
    <li> Pretty pretty colors :) I&#x27;m loving my BHcosmetics eye shadow ! Will recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend as a christmas present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package came better wrapped and quality better than expected.  It was wrapped in this paper mesh and tissue paper covered by extra large brown paper (look in images) to compensate for the size of the box and better protection of the product on top and bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When opened the palette was wrapped in bubble wrap along with plastic covering on the case itself to protect from scratches, I didn&#x27;t notice any on mine. VERY satisfied on that part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors themselves are very nice; there are the glitter colors next to the non glitter colors with plastic covering on both palettes to protect the colors from running or smearing onto other parts of the product.  None were broken, missing or cracked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t personally wear make up so I had to read other peoples&#x27; review on the applying part and they said to use primer before applying the eye shadow.  They said it comes out crusty and flakes off if you don&#x27;t use primer if i remember correctly...I read them a while back, so go look for yourself for conformation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL IN ALL- Pictures for all stated below, except for last:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside of product well protected (pictures)- CHECK&lt;br /&gt;Colors NOT broken, missing or cracked- CHECK&lt;br /&gt;Colors of decent size (U.S. Penny), picture for reference- CHECK&lt;br /&gt;Variety of colors- CHECK&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use primer before applying (read other peoples&#x27; reviews)-GO LOOK FOR YOURSELF</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this palette because I wanted a variety of colors. I&#x27;ve had this product for awhile now and I still like it just as if I just brought it. My favorite are the neutral color. Its worth the money I spent instead of going to a beauty supply store and paying way more. Other than that I&#x27;m a pleased customer.</li>
    <li> I knocked off one star rating due to 4 of the mini pots of color being broken in the mail, but they are still usable.  Every color I&#x27;ve tried is far more saturated than the drug-store variety (even the name brand stuff).  This means you use less of it and can actually see the color you are applying without using a trowel.  Most of the colors have a matte and shimmery version, and there are loads of matte neutrals so you can use this palette for whole-face contouring rather than just eye shadow, making this a wonderful kit for theatre makeup.</li>
    <li> The packaging was impeccable!!! I&#x27;ve nvr seen anything like it lol. Needless to say my 120 palette (Edition 2) was intact! EVERY SINGLE COLOR! The matte colors were very pigmented which was surprising! IN LOVE! :)</li>
    <li> I ordered it, came in great condition. Love it, has every color I need -and dont need-, highly pigmented, totally reccommend it.</li>
    <li> From the bad reviews i was expecting the worst but it arrived at my house today in ABSOLUTELY PERFECT condition. It was packaged VERY well, and the colors are absolutely beautiful. what a great deal for the quality of the product. I am completely happy with my order and cant wait to use more of it..</li>
    <li> I bought this palette about 2 months ago. Since i have bought this palette i havent used any of my other eye shadows. Overall i think it is a good product for the money. There is a big variety of colors and shades. There is a good balance of shimmers and mattes. I will probably purchase another palette with more nuetral colors because the colors in this one are very vibrant. So if you are having a hard time finding the instyle vibrant colors (which is why i bought this one) this is the palette for you! It shippe fairly fast and nothing was broken. It was packaged very well. Bh cosmetics also have the option to buy products on their site. I found the cost of most items plus shipping is cheaper on amazon.</li>
    <li> I was supposed to receive it by January 13, but it got here on January 8  NOTHING was broken or damaged.  As soon as I opened the box I fell in love with the colors;  I will definitely buy the 1st and 2nd edition!!  I LOVED IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> I got my palette a few days ago in excellent condition.It is so pretty that I couldn&#x27;t take my eyes off it for initial 15 minutes.It&#x27;s very compact making it easy to carry along while traveling. There are colors to suit every skin-tone and occasion. The pigmentation is awesome,especially the matte black color which is so intense that you don&#x27;t really require much to smoke out your look(unlike my other chalky expensive eyeshadows). The shimmery nudes in this palette are my absolute favorites. They actually show up on my Indian-medium skin tone without washing me out. For me, the color pay off is good and they don&#x27;t crease with or without eye primer.They are easy to blend and easy to take off. I prefer 120 palette on my Kat Von D eye-shadow palette. If you are a beginner like me, this is a must-have. I am glad I bought this.So far I have no complaints from this palette. I use it with Coastal Scents 22 piece brush set and Urban Decay Primer Potion. I will most definitely recommend it to friends. I love this palette and I will order again from BH Cosmetics :)</li>
    <li> I HAVE PURCHASED MULTIPLE ITEMS WITH BH COSMETICS. THE MAJORITY OF THE PRODUCTS ARE WONDERFUL... THE SHADOW PALETTES ESPECIALLY. THE LIQUID LINER ARRIVED DRIED OUT..&lt;br /&gt;THE CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT THIS COMPANY IS A JOKE. YOU CALL AND CALL OR SEND EMAILS, AND YOU RECEIVE NO RESPONSE.&lt;br /&gt;I NOTIFIED THE BBB IN ORDER FOR THEM TO LISTEN TO MY COMPLAINTS.&lt;br /&gt;SO, PEOPLE... IF YOU WANT NICE COLOR PALETTES, THIS IS THE COMPANY TO SHOP WITH... IF YOU WANT EVEN DECENT CS. THIS IS NOT THE COMPANY. BH DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THAT.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS A SHAME THAT AMAZON.COM DOES NOT SHIP OUT THEIR MERCHANDISE.</li>
    <li> The 2nd edition 120 palette is just awesome. The colors are vibrant and when used with an eye shadow base, last for hours with no hint of creasing. The palette has a great mix of mattes and shimmers. Some of the lighter colors do seem a bit sheer but if you add more than one layer, it works just fine. This palette is great for anyone who wants to do a variety of looks but doesn&#x27;t want to spend too much money. Shipping was quick and BHCosmetics has great customer service.</li>
    <li> As a woman of color (bronze/caramel complexion), I just love the colors. They blend perfectly, compliment my skin tone and last all day, also a little goes along way.  Not only do I use the shadows for my lids, I use the colors as eyeliners and blush. This case of shadows is my face and I just love it.</li>
    <li> The product arrived very fast and over the past few weekends with halloween just passing and what not i was able to use a variety of the colors and LOVE them!!!! the makeup stays on beautifully and is gorgeous and vibrant. i highly recommend this product. Just would advice buying an eye shadow primer with it and applying it before you apply the shadow. Also if you apply shadow with your finger it will literally stay on for days. Trust me it happened this weekend!</li>
    <li> this palette is really good for anyone who likes to play with shades...and the quality is really good too...the  quantity of each eye shadow is not a lot but its not too less either. not everyone can afford an eyeshadow palette by MAC, so you can get this one and then if u like certain eye shadows by mac u can get them separately, this way u will always have all the colors whenever u need them :)</li>
    <li> I got this makeup palette very fast and it actually came 1 day earlier than its due date. It came in a bubble wrap sleeve inside of another box because I also ordered another palette. When I opened it, there were no cracks or loose pots. The colors are extremely vivid and vibrant. If you&#x27;re interested in pigmented makeup, this is the makeup palette for you. It&#x27;s also not tested on animals!</li>
    <li> Love this thing! It&#x27;s got every color you could ever need, it&#x27;s got a matte and metallic version of each. The colors are true and they stay on your face really well. I definitely recommend BH Cosmetics. Great price!</li>
    <li> This is a great over all palette offering a lots of usable shades.  The color lasts fairly well but if you are going to use it for daily wear, or need it to really pop, you will get better color and it will last better if you use a good primer before applying color.</li>
    <li> I love this so so much it has a &#x27;new and improved design&#x27; so it doesn&#x27;t have a string to uncover the second pallets instead it has an opening. I will post pictures soon! The cardboard packaging was very decorative I loved it and didn&#x27;t expect it from other pictures since it was a new design. I love this so much the delivery was SO fast! I got it in two days! There was one broken color, it was a shimmery black shadow on the bottom palette on the very bottom left but i don&#x27;t mind it so much since I really wanted the matte black one and there are other shades of the shimmery black.</li>
    <li> This palette is a HOT MESS. Received it in the mail with broken shadows that scattered everywhere. The colors are overwhelmingly bright yet they do not show very well on medium-olive skin tone, especially the matte colors. The shimmer colors however are very pigmented and blend pretty well. I will most likely return this product asap simply because it was not packaged right. Such a shame :(</li>
    <li> ive never really been a fan of eyeshadow palattes so it was a big step for me to buy this one, most of the ones ive bought before have really dull colors and they fade super easily but thank God i bought this one! this eyeshadow palatte is amazing! the colors are beautiful and vibrant! i will say that 2 of the eyeshadows came a little cracked (not completely broken) but not enough to bother me. i recomend using an eye primer (i use palladio which is awesome) so you can get the brightest color possible and so it will last. i will say i havent used every eyeshadow in the case but the ones that i have used are gorgeous! def buying this again for gifts or for myself ;)</li>
    <li> The palette was nicely packed so nothing was out of order, there are so many colors to choose from shimmers mattes and all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i think the pigment is good but could be better, as long as you use primer your good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so many colors to mess around with-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ingredients are not good but overall the collection and performance is outstanding</li>
    <li> Great selection of colors to choose from, Easy to use pallet, and the colors show up bright and lasts when wearing.</li>
    <li> So many colors. Its like.... 3 years later I think. I still have this thing... I use colors all the time. They are bendable. I put on a primer before. Colors look great and vibrant!</li>
    <li> I love it!!!! I was worried some of the colors would be broken during shipping but none where. Colors are pigmented well  and I love how some are shiny and some are matte. It also came quickly and even a day early. Good buy!!!</li>
    <li> I am so glad I bought this palette! I had been considering an 88 or 120 palette for a long time but couldn&#x27;t decide between Coastal Scents or BH Cosmetics. After comparing the two brands and options I finally purchased this palette. The estimated delivery was between July 18th and the 23rd, but I received my package on the 17th which was a nice surprise. Only one of the shadow pots was cracked, but I definitely don&#x27;t blame the company; the package was marked as fragile, and the palette was wrapped in bubble wrap. The only reason I am giving this four stars instead of five is that the colors aren&#x27;t quite as bright as I had hoped. They are very highly pigmented, but a little more muted than I had expected. I would suggest this palette to someone who wants to experiment more with makeup or is looking to add a little color to their routine without breaking the bank.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this palette! There are so many colors to choose from and they don&#x27;t go on chalky like some eyeshadows I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> I ordered this palette about a month ago and I really really love it. It shipped in perfect condition. I live in Hawaii so that was really awesome it made it here without any problems. The colors in this palette are so pigmented and go on very smooth. It is fabulous quality for the price. I have since bought 2 more palettes from BH because I was so pleased with this one.</li>
    <li> I had high expectations after reading all the reviews online! Upon opening the palette of shadows, I noticed that there was excess shadow throughout the palette and it was because one of the eyeshadows was cracked (the rounded half was broken off, still usuable)! :( I looked at the other shadows and some looked as if they&#x27;ve been touched slightly (or maybe thats just the way they look?).     If this was a brand name product I would for sure return it, but seeing that it&#x27;s only $25 (for 120 shadows which some I will prob never use) and the eyeshadows are tiny anyways, I&#x27;m letting it slide!     Bh cosmetics, please make sure that this does not happen to other customers!!!!    Otherwise the shadows are great if you want a variety of colors for cheap!</li>
    <li> I got this palette on Valentines Day. It came perfect and intact.  The colors are so pigmented!! I can&#x27;t wait to try new looks with this palette.  I will be getting the blush and concealor palettes in the near future!!</li>
    <li> I have had this palette for a while now and I waited to review this and take the time out to play with all the colors, seeing as how their are so many :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+120 eyeshadow colors! Great!&lt;br /&gt;+Dominantly matte colors (which I prefer)&lt;br /&gt;+Rare colors like Red (matte) Black (Black matte is really hard to find) and a bunch of other colors.&lt;br /&gt;+Greatly pigmented&lt;br /&gt;+Takes a while for each color to reach the bottom (my white is the only one)&lt;br /&gt;+When accompanied with a eyeshadow primer they last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;+In a nice package and easy to work with&lt;br /&gt;+PERFECT for a gift. I gave this to my friend on her birthday and she loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Few of the colors do not blend well.&lt;br /&gt;-Few are not as pigmented as id like but its not a big deal since they are colors I would not wear anyways.&lt;br /&gt;-The hinge on my palette broke when UPS delivered it. And 1 color broke on my friends palette while shipping, so be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons are very minor and It does not bother me at all because the price I would pay for 2 MAC eyeshadows I get 120 eyeshadows that In my opinion are equal to or even better than MAC. I would highly suggest this palette for anyone who wants to experiment with colors and looks or even as a buy it as a gift.</li>
    <li> amazing price for Great pigments with good primer of course, the colors pop up when i apply it&lt;br /&gt;good packing, delivered on time and not damaged at all&lt;br /&gt;diffidently i&#x27;ll get more</li>
    <li> All the colors came in good shape and they&#x27;re wonderfully pigmented. To answer some confusion for anyone who may want to buy this in the future I would guesstimate that 1/3 of the colors are sparkly. There is a matte black, a sparkly almost black, and a silver color. Not really a solid gray. Also these colors look wonderful on top of a white cream. Most of the brows are also sparkly btw. There are also two slightly different shades of red in the palette, one very slightly more orange than the other. The case is also really nice and compact enough to fit in my mailbox, even though the colors are half decent sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside to getting this palette is that I can see the tray on tray design eventually being kind of annoying in the morning. Still, out of the other large palettes I&#x27;ve bought in the past this is one of the best with variety, quantity, and quality and I&#x27;m willing to live with the possibility of loosing one tray.</li>
    <li> i love how it shows up and am dark  so really good you dont to get alot there a lot of COLORS the delivery was fast i got it in 2 days so i will get this again :) love</li>
    <li> I love all the different shades, and its bang for your buck. I would recommend this product to others...very satisfied</li>
    <li> The Eyeshadow palette came fast and in perfect condition. Nothing was cracked and the colors are vibrant. I use them with my Urban Decay Primer and am good all day/night long.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this eye shadow palette! I couldn&#x27;t wait to get it in the mail &amp; start using it!! Each color was intact when I opened it, nothing was broken or missing. The colors are so bright and will actually stay on all day! I was a bit skeptical about that part... but... I&#x27;ve worn them all day &amp; even gone swimming &amp; the color stays! I still prefer to use the eye shadow with primer first, but you don&#x27;t necessarily need it. If you&#x27;re using a brush to put it on, I would suggest that you place a tissue under your eye while applying the shadow, so that it doesn&#x27;t land on your skin &amp; smear or smudge. I think I may end up buying the 1st edition as well. These are all the colors of eye shadow that you could ever need! I haven&#x27;t even used some of them yet!! If you&#x27;re looking for quality as well as quantity for THIS price... Stop Looking!! You&#x27;ve found it!!</li>
    <li> I this on time and I really do like it. This, is a good set to use.if u are a beginner like me. Even though colors are small u get a lot. Still haven&#x27;t used half of my colors, but having fun experimenting.</li>
    <li> I had put off ordering this palette because I was shopping around and I tend to sit on a purchase before making the leap of faith... esp with online orders cause you don&#x27;t always get what the pictures/product descriptions promise. When I found myself wishing I already had this in my possession every time I did my make up I decided to go for it! I got my palette promptly and not only was every color intact, they look just as vibrant in person as in the photos! I ABSOLUTELY LOOOOOVVEE IT!!!! Just about every color you could possibly want or need is in here, save for straight up neon colors! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it!</li>
    <li> I Recieved My Order Very Quickely, That Was A Plus!! Im Not Very Patient When It Comes To Those Things, But I Was Excited To Know It Was A Fast Shippment. I Had Ordered The BH 120 Palette Along With Another Palette (Which Was Not From BH Cosmetics). I Opened The Palette Which Was From A Different Brand First Just To Find One Of The Eyeshadows Broken!!! I Was So Dissappointed, Also Scared To See If The BH Palette Was Gonna Come In The Same Condition As The Other. Luckily It Was Perfect, No Broken Shadows And Swatches Very Pigmented On My Fingers. I Have Not Been Able To Use It Yet, But Just By The Look Of It I Am Very Pleased And Is of High Quality. I Am Looking Forward To Getting More BH Products.</li>
    <li> I was so desperate to get my makeup and finally after seven days of waiting I finally got it! It came in perfect conditions, for sure I&#x27;m gonna get more soon!!!! ;)</li>
    <li> I must say that I was majorly disappointed when I received this palette and realized that it is not BH Cosmetics palette. I had been watching many youtube videos of reviews and was really ready to start experimenting with that product. If you are looking for BH cosmetic palette then you should avoid purchasing this product. Since I spent the money on the palette I decide to give it a try and found that the colors are still very pigmented and I really do like the palette overall. I have been trying many makeup looks with the palettes and have seen great results and have received awesome feedback. So in conclusion, I would still say get this palette for the number of colors that it has and the fact that they are pigmented. However, just know in advance that this is not a BH Cosmetics palette.</li>
    <li> i am a new fanatic of this product. the eyeshadow is amazing if you like a subtle look brush on clean lids. for a drastic bold amazing color cover your eye with primer or civerup. this make up lasts allday and doesn&#x27;t smudge or crease. its the best eyeshadow i&#x27;ve found yet. highly recommened you will be very happy!</li>
    <li> On the positive side, this is a good starter palette for aspiring makeup artists and makeup enthusiasts.  The negative side is not all of the colors are pigmented enough to show on all skin tones and a few colors fell out of this palette.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves makeup and love to experiment with bright colors. So when I saw this I knew I had to get it for her. It arrived in about 2 days and it was in perfect condition. They bubble wrap it. The colors are very beautiful and vibrant and both my daughter and I loved it! especially her. She does very cool effects that she learns from youtube makeup tutorials, and with this pallete she has every color she needs. I absolutely reccommend this to anyone that loves eyeshadow!</li>
    <li> My wonderful boyfriend recently bought me this eyeshadow palette. I love everything about it! Because I am very creative makeup artist, this palette is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Just LOVED my palette, it came in 2 days, arrived in perfect conditions, full of bubble wrap, nothing was broken or dirty.   Already used some colors.. and I&#x60;M AMAZED.. it&#x60;s really pigmented, beautiful colors, stays long hours when used with eye primer. I went to a party for about 5 hours.. was tired and lazy to take everything off before sleep.. I was sleeping for 3 or 4 hours, and when I woke up to bring my kids to school.. what a surprise.. I could go to another party.. the make up was still there in perfect and beautiful conditions, I could just apply once more eyelash mask and be ready for another party!! LOL.   There&#x60;s about 4 to 5 iluminating shadows, I loved them! .. and all shadows beautiful colorful options that you can choose from.. if you want to be more discret, normal..  or if you want to be the one that everybody looks to your eyes.. you can do whatever you want with them.  Really satisfied, I TOTTALY RECOMEND THAT FOR ANYBODY THAT JUST WANT A BIG VARIETY OF COLORS WITH GOOD QUALITY. I LOVED THIS PALETTE. USE EYE PRIMER.   I like the NYX primer its around $7 or from E.L.F it&#x60;s only a dollar (yes only $1) you can easily find at Target or farmacies.. I have both and like them. For brasilian people I do highly recomend Make B Eye primer from O Boticário  é maravilhoso!!  Another tip is to buy the elf brushes.. their are cheap and good to start and you can make professionals make ups using them! and they cost $1 some and $3 others.. I spent $20 in 11 elf products, brushes, cream eye liner, etc..   LOVED THIS !! YOU CAN BUY AND WILL LOVE IT TOO !!!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;WOW\\&quot; That&#x27;s all I said when I finally received my Palette (7 days early ). The Colors!!! I was impressed with the colors and promptly decided to swatch a few on my arm... and yes they were TRUE TO COLOR! ( use a primer!) and I&#x27;m still walking around ( 5 hours later) with them still on and between the E.L.F ( Another cheap surprise) eyelid primer and the BH... There will be many mornings I stumble home from a night out looking as good as I did when i left!!!! *Fistpump*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Colors are plentiful and beautiful, in both matte and shimmer. Total win for me. Many colors I would have never worn/purchased before are at my finger tips to play with and for around 20 bucks ( I think that was WITH shipping) I am very very happy with what BH Cosmetics are offering to us for a more than fair price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was wonderful, packed with lots of protection. I received my product in PERFECT condition.</li>
    <li> the package was nice and the palette has no damaged. The colors are as advertised. overall a good buy.    shipment took about a week.</li>
    <li> The colors seem to be very pigmented. It was packaged nice and nothing was broken. Overall I&#x27;m pretty impressed and would recommend this to someone who was traveling.</li>
    <li> Absolutely stunning shadows. Unfortunately, mine was in not great shape. The colours (like, 10) were broken but fixable, but 2 were everywhere.</li>
    <li> Great, I like this palette. Many color we can use. Although one color is broken, there are still some similar colors can replace it.</li>
    <li> i was so excited to get this product... i was happy that it was sent to my home with in days, but when i got it i loved the packaging... then i opened it and not one not two but three  was broken. both blacks and one yucky cream color... over i am satisfied.</li>
    <li> I ordered this pallet yesterday afternoon and I got it this afternoon, I was REALLY shocked at the speed my package got here! The only downside was when I finally opened my package, one of my eye shadows were broken, but I was able to fix it with rubbing alcohol and a dime. It seems that the box it came in was too big causeing the pallet inside to shift a lot and there wasn&#x27;t sufficient bubble wrap to protect it from this. Other than that I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and the delivery.</li>
    <li> So, I recieved mines today. It didnt have any print on the box or on the actual case, but I didnt make a major deal out of it. But when i opened it, just one was broken and it was BLACK HAIR stuck on the plastic covering... NO I AM NOT MISTAKEN!!! BLACK HAIR. After being disgusted and pissed about my palette, some of the colors were not the same as on the website, like one role had celestial colors like orange and yellow or dark green n light green together. I thought that was a plus..</li>
    <li> Very pigmented but kind of messy. Overall some beautiful and varied eyeshadow colors.</li>
    <li> This pallet is definately worth having. The pallet includes all different colors from light to dark. From matte to shimmer. Within the pallet you will find every color you need. I recond this product for those who want to have a variety of colors in their collection.</li>
    <li> i got this product, and within 2 days of ordering it! i was very pleased with the fast shipping and proper packaging. i was hoping nothing was broken and was pleased to find everything was in tact. so far i love the product, but i haven&#x27;t been using it much because i&#x27;m still waiting on make up brushes! i&#x27;ve heard great things about this product and i can&#x27;t wait to try it out.</li>
    <li> good product and excellent price...unfortunately one of the shadows was all smashed up...since it was for my use that was fine, but not good for a gift.</li>
    <li> The colors in the eyeshadow palette offered a wide variety from fun, flirty colors to nice earth-tone colors. The make-up stayed on and looked wonderful. I received everything perfectly packaged and it was delivered in a timely fashion. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love the vibrant colors especially that some come in matte and glitter finish.[[ASIN:B002TPQPEE BH Cosmetics 120 Color Eyeshadow Palette 2nd Edition]]</li>
    <li> These eye shadows are absolutely amazing! They are super pigmented, stay on for hours and come in every color of the rainbow (literally). I love how there are a good mix of matte colours and glittery colours. This should be a staple in any person&#x27;s makeup collection.</li>
    <li> When i got it,   it came in amazing condition This was shipped very well. Nothing was broken.  i got it exacly when they said i was sopoose to get it!  it is small and compact it was soo worth the spend!   i can take it anywhere without any problem.   i use it everyday and i will consider buying  another one for a present!   i dont regret a thing! It is great for smokey eye!   The colors are VERY pigmented! Love every single color. The colors are gorgeous   enough said If you&#x27;re thinking about buying this palette DONT THINK IT TWICE, !   You will love it. BECAUSE I sure LOVEEE ITTT!! :D  it deff deserves to be a 5 STARR!</li>
    <li> If you want a lot of eyeshadows from natural to dramatic, from nude to colourful, this is a great way to get a lot for your buck. The quality isn&#x27;t fantastic and you will probably need to build up the shades or apply a base to really get some bang out of them, but this is a great way to start experimenting with makeup.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this palette would be that amazing for $16 only,very nice colors great quality I just love it</li>
    <li> I really hate spending a ton of money on makeup. The only makeup I&#x27;m ever uber picky about is my foundation because I don&#x27;t want something that&#x27;ll cause me to break out, so for the rest of the stuff I use, I go for what&#x27;s as good of a quality as I can get for not a lot of money. I&#x27;ve seen pallets with half the colors for 2-3x the money, so I really liked this pallet. I don&#x27;t use it every day, only on nice occasions when I do more color mixing and for costume makeup. The colors themselves are small, but there&#x27;s so many colors, it&#x27;s not a big deal. I try to vary my color choices as much as possible, but you can definitely tell that I&#x27;ll run out of neutrals much faster than the other colors. But for the price online, it&#x27;s  worth it, even if you don&#x27;t use all the colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s cheap&lt;br /&gt;-A little shadow goes a long way. You just need a light tap with a brush for a full application&lt;br /&gt;-The colors are blend-able (however, the shimmer colors blend much easier than the matte. The matte are a bit hard to blend with).&lt;br /&gt;-Once it&#x27;s on, it stays on well. You can leave it on all day and it doesn&#x27;t fade.&lt;br /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t smudge TOO much either, but I try not to touch my eyes just in case.&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-there is a lot of fallout during application (which I just take care by applying eyeshadow first,cleaning the fallout, and then applying my foundation.)&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t smudge too much, but it&#x27;s not as smudge-free as I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> All the details in the offer were very well explained, the attached pictures helped to have an idea of what exactly the product was (referring to size, type of colours).</li>
    <li> 3 of the colors where broken and when I opened it, they all fell off I don&#x27;t I&#x27;ll be buying again</li>
    <li> My bh cosmetics just arrived and it was so much more than I thought it was going to be! I love that there are bright colors but also more nutural tones! this is a must have if you are a make-up artist or just an make-up guru! I bought the second edition and im hooked!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, Awesome colors, Awesome price!!! Everything I&#x27;ve wanted in a pallete!  Colors are highly pigmented so a little swipe of the brush goes a long way!!!</li>
    <li> I received it in excellent conditions, none of the shadows came broken and fast shipping. I would recommend this product and seller. Just Perfect!</li>
    <li> I bought this item over a year ago and i absolutely lovee it!!! It has all the color you can imagine. If you&#x27;re brown-skinned you might need a primer before you apply the product!! it has the bright summer colors and also cool winter colors.  Perfect for every occasion!</li>
    <li> For the price, this product is great! You just need to get a primer to keep the color in place all day, and to make the color look as bright as it should. But, overall, you really can&#x27;t beat it for the price. With a primer, it stayed on for 8+ hours for me!</li>
    <li> It was ok 3 of the shadows were broken when i got it but i recive the palet in the same week i bought it</li>
    <li> It was shipped fast but the one thing I didn&#x27;t like is that it should have been more secure better 2 of the eye shadow was cracked and loose  but for the most of it all I loved it</li>
    <li> i just started wearing makeup this year, and i&#x27;ve learned so much from youtube about techniques and all that jazz. i bought this palette because i thought it was cheap,had a nice range in colors, and would be perfect for a newbie like me. i also bought urban decay&#x27;s naked palette. i know it&#x27;s twice the price and it features less colors, but i find it to be a hundred times more useful than this palette!     first off, i didn&#x27;t know what i was thinking buying this many colors. when would i ever wear red, pink or green eyeshadow? it has 120 colors, but over half of those are useless. secondly, the pigmentation is pretty bad compared to urban decay&#x27;s. third, it uses mica and talc, which are ingredients that are hazardous to your health.     i don&#x27;t think you should buy this unless you&#x27;re daring with colors or love giving people wild makeovers. definitely do not get this if you are a beginner. this set is basically collecting dust in my makeup drawer.</li>
    <li> After  reading and watching tons of reviews via you tube and pinterest, I decided to purchase this and it did not disappoint! the colors are amazing and as long as you use and eye primer they stay on as long as MAC and others! I usually use this palette for a natural  smoky eye look but you can do almost anything with the variety of colors. You cant beat this with a stick!! this palette should definitely be in every beginners makeup must have!</li>
    <li> Some of the colors are very bold and bright. Others apply very lightly and require building it up to achieve the actual color.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeshadow pallete Ive ever had so far, I like the variety of shade of browns especially. The shipping was fast too, it was carefully packaged with bubble wrap. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I just received the makeup kit today and so happy with the appearance of it.  NONE of the colors were broken and I was super happy about that!  I did not use it yet so I can not rate it 5 stars. :)</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!! Great eye shadow kit&#x27;.. actually one of the BEST ones out there so far!&lt;br /&gt;you get a lot of beautiful colors that last a very long time!</li>
    <li> just received the palette and the colors are great, lots of shades, fast shipping, no colors broke which is alsome, so i will probably order the 1st edition too just because a women can&#x27;t have enough colors to use. lol</li>
    <li> The pallete was packaged great, none of the colors were disturbed. The colors are  very pigmented and some bright. Overall I would say this is a great pallete if your looking for fun bright looks, however it does have smimmery AND matte black which I thought was awesome because I love to add black for a edgy colorful smoky eye.</li>
    <li> i bought this eyeshadow pallet after seeing alot of really good reviews and now I SEE WHY!!! there is SO MUCH pigment in each color it&#x27;s insane even the lightset colors show up as if they were paint! SO HAPPY with this pallet i will never buy any other eye shadow product again!</li>
    <li> I love all these colors. They&#x27;re so bright and beautiful. At first I didn&#x27;t think there were 120 colors but there are two layers. Remember to make the colors pop put white eyeliner on your eyes before the eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> The colors are super pigmented and they are super soft. I&#x27;ve done looks where they were smoked out to the extreme and these babies blend so well omg. I love all of their colors, you won&#x27;t regret this buy.💋</li>
    <li> Great Variety of colors. Very Pigmented.</li>
    <li> You get every single color in the world in one palette.  Theyre so pigmented and long lasting. This product is amazing. Sooooo worth the money. Theres mattes and shimmers, nudes and vibrant colors!! Cant get over it....</li>
    <li> Pretty good quality for a decent price. The pigmentation is as I would have expected and hoped for, it&#x27;s non-irritating on my sensitive skin, and there&#x27;s a good variety. The only design flaw, to me, is the two-tiered design that requires keeping the tiny little ribbon looped between the two tiers and carefully prying them apart to access the bottom layer of colors-I&#x27;m always afraid I&#x27;ll drop it and ruin product when carefully prying them apart. I think a better idea would be either a larger, one-layer case, or a case that had both tiers attached and easily mobile. Color-wise, I&#x27;m pretty happy with the quality for a basic variety of casual, everyday colors.</li>
    <li> Well I got My palette and it&#x27;s AMAZING!!! The colors are way better than I thought they would ever be for this price I haven&#x27;t used them with a primer yet and they still come on wonderful. I&#x27;m sure with the primer they will be even more gorgeous!! I received it a day early which was great..another review said they were the size of a dime but their more like the size of a nickel. I can&#x27;t wait to play with more of the colors!! I&#x27;m telling you if your doubting this don&#x27;t...you wont regret buying this Palette!</li>
    <li> I got mine today in the mail after ordering it on Saturday. It came far earlier than expected and in perfect condition. Love the colors and love the pigmentation of the colors.  Soooo excited to use my new palette</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow has some brilliant colours, Love the mix of colours. Bought some with the 13 Piece Brush Set with Case and sold to my co-workers they loved it.</li>
    <li> It took me a little while to fully like this palette. However it is great and I won&#x27;t need to buy eye shadows for a while. It&#x27;s great for someone starting out with make up.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these. There was one color pot slightly damaged from shipping but not do to poor packaging. Probably rough handling once it was out of the warehouse. Color pot is still useable but was not a color of major concern for me. Colors are slightly muted unless you use a eye shadow primer then they are as vibrant as the color pots. absolutely love this my 17 yr old daughter wants to get into theatre makeup so we have a lot of fun with these colors together!</li>
    <li> The price was very good for so many colors, and I&#x27;m very happy with the product. The colors aren&#x27;t quite as vibrant as I would have liked, but a white liner/eye shadow underneath helps a lot.</li>
    <li> I just started using makeup and have been using the Walgreens brand of Wet N Wild. I wanted to branch out to something better and started using the Sephora pallette&#x27;s which in all honesty isn&#x27;t the best at all... So I finally decided to try BH Cosmetics and I promise you it&#x27;s worth the buy. It is very pigmented and it came fast. :D I plan to buy another pallete asap! one thing i will be honest about tho is that two colors were broken. I was a little disappointed by once I fixed it i was inlove... :D</li>
    <li> Ive had this for nearly a year. It is great all of the colors are pigmented really well and some have very nice shimmers. well worth the money and will purchase another set one day.</li>
    <li> I received this product at lightning fast speeds, i was so happy with the shipping. It said between 8 days for shipping but it got here in 3, absolutely awesome. I was slightly disappointed with the packaging because it was a little plain for my taste but I figured that for 20 dollars it was more than sufficient. When I opened the package one of the shadows had shattered but not too badly there was still a sufficient amount off powder left for my use so I wasn&#x27;t at all upset over that. I did a few swatch tests on some of the colors and they are VERY brilliantly pigmented, so vibrant and the power was so smooth. The first day I used this palette I was absolutely floored. The colors looked amazing on me with my primer on and they LASTED ALL DAY! The colors hadn&#x27;t faded and it still looked as fresh as I had put it on that morning. Overall I do give this palette a five star rating. I would not hesitate in buying this I prommise you won&#x27;t be upset :)</li>
    <li> I had been wanting to get a palette for some time, I do makeup for people every once in a while and I wanted something that was small and compact but still offered a good variety of colors.  I just got the 120 color 2nd edition a few days ago had have been toying around with it.  First of all it was shipped very well and nothing at all was broken inside, I was shocked.  It looks good and the design is functional.  There are some good colors and the shimmers work well but first and for most you HAVE to use a eyeshadow primer with it! If you don&#x27;t the colors look cheap and lifeless.  So far I haven&#x27;t gotten any of the mattes to blend at all. But the metallic and shimmer colors have been working very well.  So if you can live without the mattes I would say just get BH cosmetics 88 shimmer palette because the mattes definitely a fail.</li>
    <li> I just received the 120 color palette 2nd edition from BH Cosmetics, and I completly love it! I have been using it all day, testing the different colors, shimmers, mattes... I have to say this palette is perfect! The colors are very vibrant and not chalky, very pigmented. The delivery was great because the product arrived perfectly. I was very affraid because I read reviews which people says that the product arrived broken. My 120 color palette from BH Cosmetics is perfect! Congratulations BH Cosmetics because you have a great product!!!</li>
    <li> I lovveee makeup and was told that this brand is the way to go if I wanted to buy a pallete buut for loose shadows this brand is my absolute fav -&gt; [...]   I suggest it:)</li>
    <li> I ordered this product it was delivered very promptly..The colors are amazing..I could not be more pleased.  I am a makeup artist and I bought this to add to my collection of brand name shadows this stacks up better than some of the high priced items...love love love it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product due to price and reviews written by others and they didn&#x27;t steer me wrong. Very vibrant colors that last the entire day or a night out on the town, as nice as any MAC shadows that I own ( which are quite a few). Very reasonable priced and well worth the buy. Received in a timely manner, in a high quality packaging that I don&#x27;t believe would break very easily. I have owned it for quite some time now and never any problems with the hinges or the trays containing the shadows even after dropping it once. There are also other palettes available through BH such as neutral colored, blushes and etc. Don&#x27;t hesitate to give this company a try, you&#x27;ll love the variety and quality of each shadow.</li>
    <li> the eye shadow is realy good and the color last a long time in the eyelids. Even, they had some troubles with my order they were very responsible and finally i got the complete order.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this, I just couldn&#x27;t wait! So the day it came I was so happy!     The first thing I saw when I opened the box was the sealed air bags. Then under that was the box. I opened it and took out the palette, which was wrapped in bubble wrap and also had a protective layer of sticky plastic. I opened the palette and my jaw dropped. I was so amazed at the colors. They are very bright and every one of them is different. There are matte and shimmer colors and all of the colors are very pigmented. Although none of the colors were cracked, there was a few that came completely out, but I just glued those back and everything was perfect. It really stands out on skin. I am mexican and I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding eyeshadows bright enough for my skin, but I read a lot of reviews about this product and I decided what the heck! This would definitely be a great gift! or something for yourself! This is a great alternative to all the well known brands like mac, smashbox, and urban decay. This is SO worth over 25 bucks. Every other website was the same price or higher, this is the only one I found with free shipping. so GO FOR IT!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this color palette. If you use a shadow base these colors have excellent color payoff!  Will be purchasing some of the other editions as well. I have used almost all of the colors and they all go on smooth and are so vibrant. Without the shadow base they are slightly less vibrant but still great.</li>
    <li> good as describe. the color is very beautiful. I use it ever time I go out. I love this eyeshadow</li>
    <li> cause it was not the original of BH cosmetics of 120&lt;br /&gt;that is why i hate it i was expecting the original one</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002TPQPEE BH Cosmetics 120 Color Eyeshadow Palette 2nd Edition]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT AND GREAT PACKAGE WITH NO DAMAGE.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVED IT AND IT&#x27;S LOOK GOOD ON COLOR FOR EYESHADOW!</li>
    <li> Price and shipping was excellent.  Cheaper than ordering direct from the manufacture and surprisingly got here a few days before the estimated shipping date.  Product is a little chalkier than I like (creates a lot of loose powder), but the colors are true to skin once applied.  I would order again.</li>
    <li> The colors look much brighter then in the picture (and thats not a bad thing) The pigment is so so, but for the price and the numerous amounts of colors you get its great! all the colors i have used so far blend great and i am definitely interested in buying another palette!</li>
    <li> This is a good buy. Would recommend it for anyone. The colours work well and all my friends comments on it and even want to buy their own! :)</li>
    <li> Bought this 2 years ago and i still have it! It  has all the colors of the rainbow and more! For a more glittery effect I use another pallatte but for everything else this is my handy dandy go to kit. Be sure to buy good soft brushes to apply these....those tiny spongy ones are useless if u want a good effect</li>
    <li> Love it! I have this pallet and i love how the colors are pigmented  bought this for a family member and she loves it def worth buying! Also pretty fast shipping</li>
    <li> Some were broke when I got them (delivery problems) but I fixed them :) wonderful colours and outcome</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this palette. It has a ton of colors in it and I don&#x27;t really use them all, but the product was well worth the money spent on it. It was shipped and recieved before the expected arrival date which, in my case is always a plus.</li>
    <li> I would recommend buying this product. the colors are really vibrant and the case is very nice. it was exactly the way I thought it would be. The only problem is that a few of the eye shadows did get damaged in the process, but overall still worth it.</li>
    <li> First of all, did bh come w. a different kind of palette aside from the glossy one b.c mines wasn&#x27;t glossy, box was different &amp; it had a mirror. Secondly, the 2nd edition does not have different shades of black, therefore, the palette you&#x27;re looking at on this product is actually belongs to the 1st edition. This needs to be updated</li>
    <li> I loved this eyeshadow. I&#x27;ve been using it ever since I received it 2 days ago in the mail. The only thing I hated was opening the box, unwrapping the super thin bubble wrap, and seeing black plastic pieces everywhere. The lid was completely broken off so I have to keep suran wrap on the eyeshadow case.     Just word to the wise, expect broken package. But good eyeshadow nonetheless.</li>
    <li> person I got this for is very happy to receive and has already used it looks forward to continue using it</li>
    <li> Product came before expected delivery date. Love the colors. The packing was excellent, eyeshadows were intact. Haven&#x27;t used them yet but will soon n by the looks of them, I will look amazing. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Perfect!!! It was.everything I wanted! If you love color this is for you. The bh website has soo many great deals.</li>
    <li> Works great and pays for itself. You dont even need to use primer for it to look good. If you dont have the money to buy  a whole lot of different colors or to get professional stuff, than this is perfect !</li>
    <li> i must say that this make-up out of  all has tobe my favorite! it goes on smooth and blends very nicely! being into cosmetics i know good quality of make up and and use various products that are name brand that dont give results as well as this make up does.. i love it</li>
    <li> Every color imaginable! Brights, darks, neutrals, shimmers, mattes..too many colors and combinations to choose from... Although two of them came broken :/</li>
    <li> I absolutelt love this palette. It has all the colors i wear and they mix very well. Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> The colors are so pigmented and easy to blend!</li>
    <li> When I received this product (a few days earlier than expected!) nothing was broken.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are small, but what i would expect for such a great price.&lt;br /&gt;The shadows are highly pigmented and great for blending, but work better when applied with a finger.</li>
    <li> Beyond expectations!  Arrived promptly. And I am loving every color on my palette! might want to purchase some white shadow base so the brighter colors can pop.</li>
    <li> Love love love my palette. It came quickly and was not broken at all. Colors are pigmented but I use a base to intensify it. Its so many colors to choose from! I currently have my hair red so.I choose not to try some of the brighter blues pinks and greens which really make up the bulk of the kit but I have used some if the colors which I love . I would recommended this to anyone</li>
    <li> I am a makeup fanatic...especially when it comes to eye shadows.  I came across this palete when I was looking for some other items.  I figured it was so cheap, I couldn&#x27;t really go wrong.  Well...the quality of the shadows are far from cheap. I love the colors, the stay-on quality, and the PRICE!!!  I can&#x27;t even imagine wearing all 120 colors, but I&#x27;m gonna spend a long time trying.  I&#x27;m getting married in 4 weeks, and I plan to use this for my wedding day.  I&#x27;m so excited to mix and match to see what will look good for my big day.  And I saved a ton of money doing it.  I wish I could give this item 10 stars...  I&#x27;ll try to do a video of me applying it this weekend.</li>
    <li> Not Too Good to Be True: It&#x27;s Really That Good! Really \\&quot;that great\\&quot; is more like it. All my girlfriends and I thought, \\&quot;120 colors for under $40 means it&#x27;s got to be low-pigment, low-quality eye shadow,\\&quot; but that&#x27;s so far from the truth. These are richly pigmented, quality shadows in an unbelievably array of colors, plus you get a mixture of mattes, shimmers and metallics. With or without eye shadow primer or base, this makeup applies like a dream. However, I recommend using a primer or base, whichever you prefer, to prevent creasing or fading that may occur from your eyelid oils, not from this shadow&#x27;s tendency to do either, because it doesn&#x27;t. Whether you&#x27;re a pro or simply a gal who loves to play and experiment with color, stop worrying that this is too good to be true and just order it. You won&#x27;t be sorry. Additionally, this would make an awesome, affordable gift for any loved lady in your life. I must add that if I&#x27;d started with this palette, I wouldn&#x27;t have had to buy as many other palettes, quads, duos, etc. because this palette of 120 colors covers the spectrum. In fact, I&#x27;ve compared it to other palettes I have and aside from a few colors, I&#x27;ve been able to match up almost every color I have to either an exact match or an extremely close match (with differences so minor that it&#x27;s negligible). Finally, I chose the 2nd edition because I saw a picture on Makeupbee.com where the artist used colors from this edition, but I&#x27;d love to know what the 1st and 3rd editions have to offer and what makes them different enough to get them, as well. If you know or find out, please let me know. :0)</li>
    <li> I finally decided to try BH Cosmetics and I am glad I did, I love that they r very pigmented colors one stroke is enough for me, Love it! And will definitely continue buying their products! Product Arrived within 3 days pretty fast and well packed nothing broken :-)</li>
    <li> This palette is absolutely amazing! I just recently got into makeup, didn&#x27;t know exactly what I was doing when I first got it. But once you see the colors you burst with ideas of how many looks you can try with just one palette. They are all highly pigmented and has colors that will work with any skin tone. It is well worth the money and I recommend this to any girl who loves color or even anybody who wants to just learn how to do makeup for themselves and all your girlfriends! Love it!</li>
    <li> I like all the color choices. I also used this for halloween. Some of the colors don&#x27;t show up as vivid as you would have thought they would but for this thing costs, it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002TPQPEE BH Cosmetics 120 Color Eyeshadow Palette 2nd Edition]]I love my new Eyeshadow Palette! Neither the case nor any of the shadows came damaged - no scratches, no dents, nothing! I&#x27;ve had this item shipped for about a month now but I wanted to truly test it before writing my review and so far, I absolutely love it. The colours are very pigmented with both matte and shimmer selections. I&#x27;ve realized that the colours only last when used with a primer or concealer. That should be a considering factor to whomever wishes to purchase this item. I, however, am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I am soooooooo happy! my eye shadow palette is perfect! I searched a lot and read about some experiences that other people had with Bh cosmetics and Coastal Scents and I saw BH Cosmetics&#x27;s eye shadow palette was much better.The colors are beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;It arrived without breaking! I can tell you , you can buy and enjoy it!&lt;br /&gt;good luck guys!</li>
    <li> Love this, wish there were more mattes but it is super cute and I love the colors, makes me go out of my comfort zone!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing and the large variety of colors are so vibrant, but it does tend to crease a bit throughout the day even though I apply primer before. I get a lot of compliments on any color I wear! If you buy it you just have to touch up when it gets wonky during the day.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about two years ago, still love it! I don&#x27;t use it often, because I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup everyday, therefore I haven&#x27;t ran out of any colors thus far. Love the mirror in it, comes in handy. My sister-in-law also got one, she was excited, and was very pleased with this product too.</li>
    <li> Its soooo nice I love it the colors are beautiful, and they last long the shipping was REALLY FAST and I got them In PERFECTTT condition so Im really happy with this product I actually order one for my mom 2 and she loved it :)..</li>
    <li> Just what we needed to have and at a very great price. Definitely recommend this to all of you looking for this.</li>
    <li> Im no make up artist but I love make up!! I have this for a yr and I use it everyday!! Love the shades color the texture it lasts all day!!! I have nothing but positive things to say about this A+++++++ so happy w product!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping amazing product.  the colors are even better in person. Great i Quality its a must have ladys I will buy more thank u :-)</li>
    <li> got this for my bfs lil sis some colors arent as pigmented as others but all in all great product for the price, and as long as you use primer, itll help alot, she uses too faced shadow insurance.</li>
    <li> I got this set bc I saw it in u tube videos. I had pretty low expectations.The quality is very poor. Only the shimmer colors work. most of the matte colors are VERY sheer and some don&#x27;t come out at all. Your better off getting something cheap at the drugstore at least u wont pay for shipping. I will probably throw it out.</li>
    <li> I bought one on there website years ago and I&#x27;m in love with their palettes!!! The price was great and I use white eyeliner (nyx jumbo pencil in &amp;#34;milk&amp;#34;) before applying to bring out the true pigments. They are very vivid when used properly. I bought one for a very good friend for her birthday this year and she loves it as much as I do...don&#x27;t forget you&#x27;re white pencil for more vibrant color!!!!</li>
    <li> The colors are nice and vibrant, and last along time, definitely recommend. Worth the price, would definitely consider purchasing again!!</li>
    <li> this is just a palette i needed... fast shipping and the package was neat......i would order a next one in due time</li>
    <li> I love this product!! All of my eye shadows were perfect! none of them were harmed from shipping! when i received my palette it came with a ton of bubble wrap around it! So there was no possible way of the eye shadows breaking! The eye shadows are very very pigmented which is super good! It comes with a ton of amazing colors! The picture does this palette no justice! The colors are much more richer! I completely recommend this palette!! plus the shipping was really fast Evan thought i picked the longer 5-8 day shipping because it was $5.00 cheaper! I love this palette! now im going to try to buy more because of the amazing deal and great quality!</li>
    <li> I never thought i would use so many colors but when i purchased this it was well worth buying I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> I recieved this package bubble wrapped inside and out in a few layers. It also had air pocket packing, to say the least I was impressed. None of the colors were broken. I opened it and tested a few of the colors to find they were highly pigmented and went on very smooth! It lasts longest with eyelid primer, but that is true for basically every shadow. There is a wide range of shimmer/glitter/matte colors, which is great because I am the makeup artist for a local art and drama photographer, and I never know what I will need next! I was expecting a \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; scenario, but instead I was pleasantly surprised. I will be buying from this company again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this palette! The colors are vibrant, and I was able to make nice lip glosses from them!  The case although flimsy is of no consequence when you figure the low price and multitude of colors in palette. Handle with care!</li>
    <li> Received it in the mail and it was wrapped up with bubble wrap and when I opened it - there were 4 colors that were cracked. :( My daughter picked this out for her birthday for November 25th and I am hoping that it isn&#x27;t a big deal. It is always a pain to send things back so I kept it. I would have given a better rating if some of the colors weren&#x27;t cracked.</li>
    <li> So many beautiful colors! Being African American, I was concerned but the colors showed nicely on my brown skin. I am so happy I have found a good eyeshadow palette!</li>
    <li> Lots of colors to choose from, only thing is it does crease easily but still fun for days you want a random look but don&#x27;t want to pay for expensive colors!</li>
    <li> it was jus perfect, my mom loved it !! looks just like the picture. came on time amd just so darn beautiful lol :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this simply for halloween, when I needed a red eyeshadow and I couldn&#x27;t find one anywhere, and this was cheaper than buying a name brand eye shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is really great to have all these colors right where you need them, especially for a cheap price. I am not a make up artist, and I really, only wear makeup on Halloween or on special occasions, and so this will last me a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is that some of the shades aren&#x27;t pigmented enough, it would take several layers of the color to make it the same color as in the palette. On the other hand, some colors are pigmented enough to stain your skin afterwards. I did a big pink/red eye makeup and when I washed my face several hours later, my skin was slightly stained with the hot pink color, and I used eyeshadow base, as well. It was no big deal for me, I just washed my face around my eyes really well the next morning and it seemed to work just fine.</li>
    <li> some color is dry n less pigmented then other u need to add base eyeshadow to help it.. anyhow.. its an awesome collection for fairies makeup</li>
    <li> Amazing colors. If you like colorful, artistic makeup, this is the color palette for you!!! I absolutely love these colors. My designs are endless. Highly Recommend a 12-32 pc. makeup brush set for best effects!!</li>
    <li> i wish some of the colors were brighter but over all its a good product in a beautiful case :D</li>
    <li> I really like this color palette, however, the product came damaged. It looked as if the pallet had been smashed around so a lot of the colors were broken and all over the place. I cleaned it up and love running to this palette</li>
    <li> Love this palette. Colors very bright and pigmented.</li>
    <li> I love the color variation a pigment.</li>
    <li> Colors are amazing and stays on... Love love love it</li>
    <li> These eyeshadow are the best I have found quality and price so far. Vibrant colors you barely have to use much. I bought a set for my 16 year old niece and she loves it too. This product is not tested on animals and are a member of peta.</li>
    <li> Love the colors..it came wrapped very tightly...quick deliverly at a very good price..if you love pretty colors.. give this a try..you will love it</li>
    <li> This product is better than what I ecpected</li>
    <li> The case arrived way earlier than expected which was a pleasant surprise.  The case was also very well packaged like described in other reviews, however, when I opened the package 3 of the top colors were completely cracked, and one on the bottom.  As it would be they were colors I would&#x27;ve used the most so that sucked.  But the quality and variety of the other colors is nice.</li>
    <li> Loved this product! Get it!</li>
    <li> These eye shadows are excellent quality for the price. For years I wore drugstore brand eye shadows. Either they creased in my eye lid throughout the day and became messy or were too pigmented and had major fall out. These eye shadows, with a eye primer (I use NYX) look great. I&#x27;m very sensitive to eye products and have had no problems. I have a few expensive eyeshadows as well and the shadows in this palette are just as good.</li>
    <li> I think the colors are beautiful, I just hate that a few of my colors were already damaged before I was able to open them. I still kept it because I didn&#x27;t get a good deal with returning it to receive another palette. I guess I still got a great deal because out of 120 about 8 of the colors were ruined. so I really got 112 which is still a lot of colors, but I just feel like when you pay for something you should get what you paid for and nothing below that.</li>
    <li> my daughter love, loved, loved the assortment of colors. and used not only for glamor make up but special fx applications, too.</li>
    <li> this set has both matte and non matte shadows, can basically create any look, as long as you have a good primer, even though the pots look small, it lasts a lot, and you get a lot of bang for the buck, plus i follow a lot of muas on youtube and they have this palette, so i can easily recreate the same looks.</li>
    <li> Bought for my lady and it has milca talc and hell other s*** we dont need, other than the chemicals I gave 2 stars because there is an assortment of colors and she looks hot</li>
    <li> OMG this is the best cosmetic palette that I have ever bought.I really love it. The colors are absolutely amazing and there so many to choose from.</li>
    <li> OK SO....The package arrived as scheduled however it was not the 2nd edition...it was the first. Highly disappointed!!!!!!! The bright side is that the colors were all in tact.</li>
    <li> I love all the colors , there everything I&#x27;ll ever need . I received my package two days earlier then expected which is a plus , I&#x27;ve been waiting to get one of these palettes for a while to improve my makeup skills and it&#x27;s going to come in handy especially since Halloween is around the corner I never had a palette that gave me every color.&lt;br /&gt;It was all wrapped up when I opened it but once I took the bubble rap off i seen pink dust all over the box so I knew something had cracked off and was making a mess . I opened the palette and got pink dust all over my black pants. Only one of the shadows was cracked but it was really messy and also spread to some of my other colors. So it could off been better,  I hope it doesn&#x27;t happen again.</li>
    <li> I just love the heck out of this palette. I took pics of it and put them on my facebook page and my coworkers have been putting orders in also.</li>
    <li> I used only Mac until I tried this brand and was very very skeptical but suprised that it was just like MAC makeup brand! Color stays on long and shows up really well on my skin however I am light skin. Came packaged well and nothing broken. Very pretty colors in palettes. This should last me for years and I will be saving hundreds of dollars not having to buy MAC eyeshadow brand again! :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the colors that come in this palette. Between the shimmer and the mat, from almost 5 or more different shades of each color. This palette will give you the versatility of doing your eye shadow in the most creative way possible without caring around several different eye shadows. I do believe my next BH Cosmetic purchase will be the Nuetral EyeShadow Palette.</li>
    <li> Bh cosmetics have some of the best pigmented eye shadows&lt;br /&gt;These are very vibrant and very little fall out I will most definately be ordering again</li>
    <li> A couple of the colors had broken, even though it was carefully packed.  These pallettes are nice and the colors are intense.</li>
    <li> Came in no tome, no more than a week, but when i received it, but it was not bh cosmetics, it was a dupe version, most eye shadows were okay and pigmented, but i didn&#x27;t pay my hard working money for a dupe or a fake, i payed for the real thing</li>
    <li> I got my pallet and I&#x27;m more than happy to say that I am very pleased. The colors are vibrant and nice I love them. I use them almost everyday. It&#x27;s a great gift idea. This was a good buy</li>
    <li> pretty colors to be found in this palette. i like bright, vibrant colors and there are quite a few of those here. some of the colors aren&#x27;t that great and don&#x27;t go on well and don&#x27;t stay on well unless you wear an eye primer before putting on the shadows. but most of the colors are awesome and i really like wearing bright stuff as i get compliments on it all the time.  just be sure to wear an eye primer before venturing into some of the bright/deep colors in here otherwise your eyes will have creases relatively quickly after putting them on.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday and even got some of the other palettes 3rd and 5th and the neutrals as birthday gifts. Great value for money.</li>
    <li> sent this as a gift to my sister. she absolutely loved it. the colours are nice and she used a bit of primer to boost the colour. she&#x27;s a pretty happy camper</li>
    <li> I use this everyday! I love it! I suggest you buy a good primer, so it will last all day. With primer it looks just as good as the expensive shadows.</li>
    <li> Product itself is amazing !  Used it for Halloween for my 2 girls and the color saturation was super!  I needed&lt;br /&gt;Red for around the eyes for one daughter&lt;br /&gt;And all the Halloween makeup kits said not to use red around the eyes (I don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;Know why).  I was skeptical if the red would be dark enough, but it was great!  I used some primer underneath and it stayed put all night.  My only complaint is that it was broken in a couple of spots when I got it.  Just the powder itself, not the case.  Fabulous product.</li>
    <li> It came in before its original time. Packaged nicely and secure. Opened it and EVERYTHING was PERFECT. No broken pallets. I love this. I bought it as a gift for someone and I think I might have to buy myself one now. The colors are so vibrant and pretty and a very durable case. Good buy!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this kit.  The range of colors and finishes are a lot of fun to play with.  The shadows blend nicely and last.  A girl can&#x27;t ask for more.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> We got this for our daughter for Christmas...she has had a similar set that needed to be replaced...this is much better quality the reds and pinks do not stain her eyelines...she is loving this eye shadow and loves all the colours...</li>
    <li> I have to give this pallets a five because I use it everyday and I love it the colors are the best thing ever shipping was great my package was in great condition BH palletes are a must buy they last all day omg please Dont miss out on good quality make up I would give 10 stars</li>
    <li> Great quality. Love the colour constradt and variety. The shadow lasts and is applied easily. Some shaddows are falling out og tje container already. Very fragile.</li>
    <li> This blush palette is the bomb! All the colors are pretty and very pigmented,it goes on well and does not break out your face.The quality is like Mac cosmetics</li>
    <li> I expected the colors to be richer... I may try with water and see if helps. Good colors though.... Once I figure out how to make them pop on my brown skin</li>
    <li> Great color variety but one or two of the eye shadows was broken and was messy when I opened it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve created so many looks with this palette! I get so many complements also! The best part is that it is so cheap and very pigmented.</li>
    <li> So the shipping was very fast i literally ordered it 2 days ago and it arrived on my b day very quick so it was an awesome birthday surprise lol i loved all the bright colors and i cant wait to start doing different make up but when i opened my package i was upset because 3 of my colors where broken thats not fair and it was the main colors such as red and blue and orange i was very upset i would give them a 5 star if it wasnt for the way that 3 colors were broken :( please package safer next time</li>
    <li> This has every color you would ever need and more.  Love love love it for the price its a steal. Hss all the in style bright colors that are so fun.  Make sure to use a primer so you keep the true color.</li>
    <li> I love the quality of the product for the price. It goes on so opaque no matter what color it is which is good for me because of my mocha skin tone. My skin is really sensitive and I had to find another eyeshadow to use because it was breakin&#x27; out my eyelids everytime I used it. I heard a lot of great things about BH Cosmetics as far as the quality and price, but not much about how well it works on sensitive skin... I tried it and it works! Stays on alll day and night. I always use a shadow base though.</li>
    <li> It was a great present for my little sister in law she loved it!! I also hot my self one amazing.</li>
    <li> I love all the bright colors in this palette, they show up nice and vibrant. I would recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> I really love this palette!!! The colors are Very pigmented. I usually only have to go to this palette to get the colors I need. Plus, the shipping from bhcosmetics is GREAT!! I received my order with in 8 days of ordering it and everything was in tact. None of the shadows were broken. I will definitely be purchasing again!!</li>
    <li> Love love love this palette!!! It&#x27;s a definite must!! I usually don&#x27;t buy stuff online but this was well worth my 17$$$</li>
    <li> Love them thanks fast shipping</li>
    <li> I just received the make-up case and it is very nice; love the colors and came two days early!!!! thank you, great experience with seller.</li>
    <li> I must say that this was quite a surprise!  I&#x27;ve been a big fan of MAC products for the past few years.  However, I was getting extremely tired of spending so much money on one color at a time, so when I stumbled across this, I figured...why not?  This palette offers all kinds of colors, some of which I haven&#x27;t even used yet.  I&#x27;ve been getting compliments left and right on how good my eyes look.  I&#x27;ve been doing all kinds of new stuff.  Before this palette, I was really keeping my makeup neutral.  Not anymore!  I really like matching my makeup with whatever color I&#x27;m wearing.  Nice!  However, I must suggest that you use a really good primer.  I use Urban Decay, and I&#x27;ll swear by it each and every time.  The only reason I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because there were no reds in this palette, but the small pictures seem to suggest that there are.  I could really use some reds since I wear those type of colors all the time.  But again, this palette is great for any age, from day time (work) to an evening out on the town.  :)</li>
    <li> Not sure if it was just me but this certainly did not look like it was from bh it had no brand name and 2 of the eyeshadow were broken very upset!!!!😠</li>
    <li> This says it&#x27;s a bh product but it&#x27;s not. The pigmentation is kinda low but you get what you payed for</li>
    <li> Shipping was late and when i recieved it the brown color was broken and smeared all over the box but other than that it was good.</li>
    <li> I was looking this for a very long time and its perfect. Thank you very much for everithing. :-) ;-)</li>
    <li> This palette is awesome! For the price you get with all the colors you can choose from is awesome! They are pretty pigmented as well. If you&#x27;re first starting out with makeup or not which ever one it is this is a good palette to get.</li>
    <li> I love this palette. There are so many beautiful colors both sparkling and matte. I would recommend it to anyone looking for vibrant colors.</li>
    <li> My bh pallette came quick and was packed very well....this product is great the eyeshadow will blow your mind ...the colors will blow your mind they are very pigmented ....buy it you will be so amazed and happy......love bh cos i will buy again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this palette!!! The colors are VERY pigmented, you only have to tap your eyeshadow brush softly and you will get a good amount of product. I usually only have to go to this palette to get the colors I need. Plus, the shipping from bhcosmetics is GREAT!! I received my order with in 4 days of ordering it and everything was in tact. None of the shadows were broken. I will definitely be purchasing again!!</li>
    <li> imagina 120 colores de sombras colores matte y con brillo wow increible esta mucho mejor que la edicion 1 .les recomiendo la 2 edicion.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased my first makeup eyeshadow palette and are thoroughly impressed.  It was packaged extremely well and it looked exactly how I saw it online.  The colors have enough variety for me to experiment with and learn different techniques of applying eyeshadow.  Because I have a darker tone for a lot of the vibrant colors I have to wet my eyeshadow brush to realy get a true pigmented look, but I don&#x27;t have to pack on tons and tons of the eyeshadow to get the color I desire.  For beginners like myself, I&#x27;d totally recommend this product.  And even if you aren&#x27;t sure about the colors itself, try mixing them with a darker or lighter shade and have fun with your creativity. For the price compared to going to MAC or Sephora...or even buying different mini-palettes from Wal-Mart or Target...this is a really nice kit.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product a few weeks back, came in when it said it would and the quality is amazing. This was definitely worth the $30. The only thing that would&#x27;ve made this product even better would be to have came with a few brushes. It was a little difficult to keep cleaning my own make up brushes for different colors. But it wasn&#x27;t a huge issue at all. I&#x27;ll still be buying the neautral pallete soon. :)</li>
    <li> I spent a few weeks trying to look for a very big palette. Many were either way too expensive or flimsy looking. When I came across this palette I thought it was just going to be another little cheap little plastic pan with lowly pigmented colors.   Well boy was I wrong! I looked through many of the reviews and watched some people demonstrate it on youtube. With the great reviews and low price, I decided to just go for it. The shipping was at light speed. The package was marked fragile and was double warped with bubble wrap. You will be shocked to see how compact the palette actually is. But that just makes it way easier to take places. The outside look of the palette is very sleek. It catches finger prints but it&#x27;s not a big problem. The two trays are very easy to separate. The colors are gorgeous! Both matte and shimmer shadows galore! And they are very pigmented. Especially if you use primer. I am just a beginner and I can create awesome looks with the palette. I would recommend addition 2 over 1 because this has more neutral colors witch are always a must. If you&#x27;re thinking about buying this palette, don&#x27;t have a doubt in your mind! You will love it.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to let people know that I love all the color, the shipping were fast, I got my palette on time it wasn&#x27;t broken.I will continue to do business with you. Thank U</li>
    <li> The main thing I loved about this eyeshadow palette is the brightness of all the colors! All of the Eyeshadows came in perfect condition because this company sends the eyeshadow with a fragile label and they bubble wrap it. :) I&#x27;m in love with each and every color and If your looking for good quality in an affordable eyeshadow palette this is it !</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors :D arrived a day before it was supposed too :D</li>
    <li> quality product, great price.</li>
    <li> great product great value! i will be getting the neutral set too</li>
    <li> I currently own a smaller pallet by Coastal Scents. I loved it and read some promising reviews for this product. I received the product on time and in great condition. Unfortunately I&#x27;ve used about three to five of the colors and was very disappointed. The pigment was very weak and it took a lot of playing to get the color even remotely close to what it looks like.  It is also messy and powdery and doesn&#x27;t stay well on my brushes (like my other makeup)&lt;br /&gt;I suppose the two stars I give are for the quantity of colors and the shipping haste.&lt;br /&gt;Overall the product is maybe good for a beginner or younger person. Not someone who can tell the difference between good quality eye shadow and the &amp;#34;impostors&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> For some reason eye shadow doesn&#x27;t like my eye lids very much, I have tried many, even the most expensive ones in the local stores, that&#x27;s using a primer also, but this set is perfect. Every color and combination you may need is there, and by the end of the day, the make up is still all there! I don&#x27;t have the money to buy high class make up, and to tell you the truth, I once had a small pallet from sephora (idk if it was old, I hope not cuz it was bought from the store when given to me) but compared to that one, I prefer this one waaaay better!! Any day, plus the price you can&#x27;t beat!!! You will fall in love also, trust me ;)</li>
    <li> I am really pleased with this product.  Colors are very pigmented with a primer.  Very good product few just a few dollars!</li>
    <li> Good colors that go on very well. There is a good amount of product for it being a palette. Very happy with it</li>
    <li> i love this makeup. great qulity and price</li>
    <li> I love the colors and the quality of the eyeshadows, especially that there are some that are matte and shimmery.</li>
    <li> The palette was packed so nicely. The case material is very good, i liked the profesional look it has. Lots of colors to choose. I like better the shimmer colors than the pale ones because they blend better. I think this palette is good for the price it cost, but if your looking for quality good pigmented colors this is not for you!</li>
    <li> Okay, so I was super skeptical about these shadows because of many of the negative reviews, but I just got them in the mail and they are GORGEOUS! They&#x27;re very pigmented and I mean, they&#x27;re obviously not gonna be MAC quality, they&#x27;re 11 bucks, but they&#x27;re definitely about revlon status or good drug store brands. I&#x27;m obsessed with makeup and wanted something that had all the colors I needed in one so I will most likely throw away all my other shadows away and put these in my makeup box instead. I LOVE these!&lt;br /&gt;They also arrived very quickly, like two days after they were shipped. I&#x27;m definitely a happy camper.</li>
    <li> neat colors and long lasting... great product</li>
    <li> Not a Real Happy Camper the colors dont show that good when u apply then</li>
    <li> The item came damaged and covered in eyeshadow, wish i didnt have to give it any stars.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. I love the pigment colors</li>
    <li> Some colors are easy to keep on and many others fade so fast. I only really like the browns though I actually only bought it for the brights :(. Definitely needs eye primer before usage.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeshadow it is the best!!!! I have all the eyeshdow i&#x27;ll ever need and since I am in beauty school this is an excellent product to have!</li>
    <li> I was glad when the shipment came which was fairly quick but when I used it, it left a rash over my eyelid &amp; the colors applied were notthe colors that showed up on my lid.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THIS BEST PRODUCT IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD....All my clients are coming on saturday for my make-up party and they are going to love this i love the colors i actually ..put it on this moring ...I LOVE IT you must at all times use a great primer so the colors can show bright and last long as in up to 8 hours in the day yess ..i love it..</li>
    <li> Got this early but when i open it one of the eyeshadow was cracked. I didn&#x27;t have time to send it back and make any complaints because I needed it for a photoshoot. The black eyeshadow (cracked one) was all over my table and my hands trying to collect most of what was left. That was the only bad part about it. Other then that, everything looked good!</li>
    <li> I received this within a few days and I am very content with this palette. Not only are there so many great colors to create gorgeous, sultry looks, but there are both, matte and shimmer colors! A little goes a long way, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about wasting any product. Those lil&#x27; pans last a long time, especially with 120 gorgeous colors; and all colors in between. I&#x27;ve received many compliments on the way I do my eye makeup with this palette. I like to do candy pastel barbie looks to a wash of sheer, and even deeper, smokey looks. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this palette. A really great buy. Will purchase again. Thanks, BH Cosmetics.</li>
    <li> When i received the palette it came in a beautiful package and in perfect condition. I expected it to be damaged in some way but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Tons of colors that have lots of pigment! There is every color combo imaginable in this set. I would highly recommend getting this as a gift too. For the price of 120 colors, you cant go wrong. I will be picking another one up for my sister soon. Best if used with a primer or a base. I use the MAC paint pots and the color lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Big choice, good quality, small size, no Irritation of the skin and careful delivery. My gf really love this palette, because she has relevant makeup for every dress. I&#x60;m really happy that she doesn&#x60;t mix eyeshadows from different box of different dubious producers already. It&#x60; s really save my time, when i&#x60;m waiting her. She also can choose sexy colors for our night games.</li>
    <li> It have alot of colours and this helps with my makeup class.&lt;br /&gt;Colours are true to what you see in the picture.</li>
    <li> These colors are amazing!! Price is right, they adhere perfectly with the primer, and the variety is great. Best makeup I&#x27;ve purchased in ages! Also cruelty free!</li>
    <li> love this Palette. prefect for me who wear alot of make up. I recommend anybody&lt;br /&gt;to order this Palette prefect, prefect. I know I will be ordering again in the future</li>
    <li> A few of the colors are broken. I am a little disappointed and hope that my daughter isn&#x27;t to upset.</li>
    <li> At first when I bought this i was a little if about this..because i have med dark skin.I wasn&#x27;t liking that i had to pack it on so much...then I got eye primer and a white eye shadow .With primer alone it shows up so much better. I also noticed if you dampin the brush little the color comes out stronger.</li>
    <li> excellent product, in perfect condition. Already know the site, because I have done many safe shopping. keep buying satisfied and satisfying family with gifts.</li>
    <li> Omg I love this palette!! The colors are so bright and pretty,I have gotten so many complements,because I love to wear mixture of colors.. Utube have tutorial on this palette..</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow achieves such rich and vibrant colors, and it blends like a dream. Definitely a good palette to have</li>
    <li> This is AMAZING! Loved the quality, came exactly 3 days after I ordered it. It&#x27;s perfect for MUA&#x27;s! Love it!</li>
    <li> i am very sensitive to makeup and this did not cause any issues! now the quality of the makeup isnt amazing but it is not bad either. i would say comparable to a drug store brand.i have had this pallet for 2 years now and i still use it daily! my favorites are the shimmery colors those seem to stand out better and last longer.good variety of colors to play with also</li>
    <li> This is a great palette for a beginner who wants to experiment with lots of things. I do a lot of stage looks and dramatic huge eye looks. I was tired to buying new colors every time and having tons of loose pans floating around. This is perfect for experimenting with color without spending tons of money on individual shadows. When I find color combinations I love, I might buy higher end makeup to use in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makeup is really chalky and you can expect fallout with just about every color if you&#x27;re not meticulous. Definitely use an eye primer or it won&#x27;t really stay on at all. I use Urban Decay&#x27;s eye primer potion and it&#x27;s very effective with this palette. The colors in the pans look a lot darker than when they&#x27;re applied, so swatch things to get a better idea of color matching. Everything is very pigmented, but chalky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin, so pretty much everything irritates it. So don&#x27;t read too deeply into that part of the review. Finding things I can use without irritation is impossible.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, some colors isnt as pigminited. Some colors are drier than others only used a few times. I got better eyeshadows.</li>
    <li> BEAUTIFUL COLORS THAT STAY ON AND LAST.</li>
    <li> I bought one for a gift as well.  They come in about a dozen color combinations, so choose wisely, make up lovers.</li>
    <li> the best of the best, just love it</li>
    <li> I love this palette the colors are so pigmented I use with my nyx jumbo pencils makes the color really stand out</li>
    <li> got this for my sisters bday.. she loved that it came with so many colors.. n said it stays on good.</li>
    <li> Very good only the black color is broke😔so everything is good😄</li>
    <li> I just got my Bh Cosmetics eyeshadow and I already love it . It&#x27;s so many colors too choose from and I could always have eyeshadow for any outfit I wear . When it came in the package everything was good and in order and nothing was cracked . It looks just like the picture !</li>
    <li> Okay. So I recieved the 120 Palette by BH Cosmetics. As far as shipping goes, I got it like FOUR DAYS EARLY!! (yay!) So that&#x27;s always a plus. The product itself...all I can say is A+ !! The colors are pigmented. U barely have to tap the colors to get some on your brush. I love to do makeup and I can tell that I will have this for a long time. No colors were broken (came in bubble wrap around the container). Also, I love the back of the box because they suggest other products to buy (Professional Camouflage Concealer, Professional Blush, Contour &amp; Blush, etc.). Um, EXTREMELY GOOD EYESHADOW!! Great variety!! They also give you two &#x27;blacks&#x27; which is a very popular color with me.</li>
    <li> I really like all of the colors in this palette, they are very bold and bueatiful! One problem I had was when I got the palette the box was damaged, this left one of the shadows busted, and the case cracked. Other than that I am still able to use the shadows and was able to fix the busted one buy using a dime, rubbing alcohol, and pressing it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m particularly fond of this palette because of the wide variety of colors. The only real complaint that I have was that one of the colors was broken up from being handled roughly, but it was a shade I&#x27;ll never use. Other than that, it was exactly what I wanted. *TIP* This eyeshadow works best and up to it&#x27;s full potential if you use a eyeshadow primer first.</li>
    <li> I knew people spoke highly of the pigment BUT WOW its so much better than i thought!!!! First of all my palette arrived a day early (yay!) and it was packaged so well and nothing was broken. I opened it and wanted to stare at the amazing colors all day long!!!! I can&#x27;t stop using Exclamation points thats how happy i am!!! best product I&#x27;ve invested in.  I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone.</li>
    <li> I was so worried that this pallet was going to be broken upon arrival. I had read so many reviews about where people had gotten them and the shadows were broken.  None of my were. They are all perfect. The case is tough, and it weighs alot.  The pigments are amazing, and with the NYX shadow stick in milk, all of my BH eyeshadows stand out very well, and last!</li>
    <li> The Price is Excellent, the quality is good/okay and the shipping time was good.&lt;br /&gt;I have had no problem with creasing using the product as long as a use a primer and I would say that the stay wear is between 8-11 hours.</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful, pigmentation is great. Packaging was very well since none of the colors were broken. arrived in perfect condition. couldn&#x27;t be more excited to try it out !!! &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> One Of The Shadows Had Crumbled, Lucky For Me It Wasn&#x27;t My Favorite Color. I  Will Be Purchasing More Items.</li>
    <li> Just got this yesterday. Came in great condition. When I opened the palette, it seemed gorgeous!! But when I started playing around with it, the colors weren&#x27;t showing well, seemed faded. Use primer. So far, its good.</li>
    <li> Especially being only around 20 dollars you can&#x27;t go wrong. This palette has 120 shades of neutral, and bright alike. You cover all your basics, the whites, off-whites, blacks greys browns, shimmers and mattes, as well as a full range of blues, reds, oranges, greens etc. They are very highly pigmented unlike the other cheap eyeshadows that you can barely tell are on. This is a HUGE deal and definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> I liked the palette, colors are vibrant and stay on....WITH PRIMER. I use NYX High Definition primer. Without primer they don&#x27;t seem to adhere. I ordered it on nov.16 and it arrived on jan 6th. For the price its a really good deal. The colors are about the size of a dime. I will eventually order it again.</li>
    <li> very nice the colors look great i have not used it much but i did tried few colors i would have given 5 but when the package arrived one of the color was damaged and part of it was on the packaging it is not a big issue I might have happened during delivery. so really 4.5 rating.</li>
    <li> Love the palette, vast array of colors , colors are very pigmented.  Show up nicely on darker skin.  Colors show up even better if eye primer are used, they also last well.</li>
    <li> I give it five stars bc it&#x27;s a lot of eyeshadow but some colors r cheaply made and don&#x27;t even stay on my eyelid for ten seconds.</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow are amazing....!!!! I never used because I do not going out yet, but I tried at home and is so beauty, they arrive so fast and very well...! Thank U</li>
    <li> great selection for color which is why I bought it. keep in mind the quality is not all that great but if you know how to apply eye shadow you can make it look great, a lot of my friends had no idea this was a cheap brand they compared it to urban decay even. the only issue i have is the application and wear tons of fall out to get a nice coverage i use visine to get a creamy texture sometimes especially if I want to use it as eyeliner which works pretty good to.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t rate on the packaging in which it arrived, because it was a Christmas gift, however I can say that all the colors are in tact and I can rate on how much I love this palette. The colors are vibrant and the shimmer colors are GREAT. I use these colors with a primer and they last all day! This is my first large eyeshadow palette and I can&#x27;t be happier!!!</li>
    <li> I love the colors and dey look just as dark &amp; light on ur skin as u see dem in da set</li>
    <li> The palette I ordered was the 2nd edition, which it clearly states in the description, but ended up with 3rd edition. Was trying to duplicate some makeup looks from a youtuber that uses the 2nd edition from BH cosmetics exclusively.  Annoyed but didn&#x27;t bother sending it back. Palette also had a few broken eyeshadow pans.  Buyer beware, make sure you get the right edition you order. Just order directly from BH cosmetics, I certainly will the next time.</li>
    <li> I used it for Halloween.</li>
    <li> Great colors but the pigments aren&#x27;t very good. It seems to fall off the eyelid with a small breeze. Bummer. :-(</li>
    <li> The palette arrived quickly.  I ordered on a Sunday and received it on Wednesday.  The colors are absolutely beautiful.  They&#x27;re vivid and rich.  However, I&#x27;m extremely disappointed that one of my eyeshadows was completely broken into tiny pieces upon arrival.  It&#x27;s bad enough to receive a damaged product, but this is particularly bothersome because I bought this as a gift for someone.</li>
    <li> This palatte is fantastic!!! I&#x27;ve had it for over a year now and it still like brand new. I love all the colours...both matte and shimmer. The colours work even better with an eyeshadow base. They are bright, highly pigmented and blend well.</li>
    <li> So pleased with this product!! Arrived two days before it was suppose to get here. Nothing was broken and was so well packaged!!! Thank you BH cosmetics!!</li>
    <li> I. Love. This. Palette. I couldn&#x27;t WAIT to receive this, &amp; when I did, I used it right away! Delivery was on time, maybe early; I don&#x27;t remember. But overall, a must buy for makeup lovers. Pigmentation is very good.</li>
    <li> I love MAC eyeshadows and NYX isn&#x27;t bad in comparison. These are definitely better than my NYX shadows. The colors are rich and strongly pigmented so they go on beautifully and give good contrast. (note: a good primer will help shadow stay put if you have oily eye lids.)</li>
    <li> I received this item earlier than the arrival date which was a pleasant surprise. When I opened it up, it was wrapped very carefully and there was no damage to any of the colours. When I used them for the first time, I was pleased to find out they went on very easily and very bright! Very, very happy! Would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> This product arrived in EXCELLENT condition...I love this tons of different color choices that your able to choose from... It goes on very even and smooth...The first day i put on the eye shadow i got so many compliments on it...i can see now that im gonna have to purchase the other editions as well...GREAT JOB BH COSMETICS...</li>
    <li> The package arrived two days earlier than the ETA date in excellent condition. Can&#x27;t wait to try out the colors. I did a quick  comparison to a few of my MAC shadows during my lunch hour and they seem extremely comparable as far as pigmentation.</li>
    <li> This review has been delayed for a very very long time.. I got this product after reading rave reviews, but am not at all satisfied with this product. I will never buy this again and never recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the shades had already cracked when I opened the package, but i let it pass only because I needed to use the product like NOW when I had got it. But the worst part was that the pigment would not stay, I had to literally dab the brush too many times for the eye shade to even be visible on my skin and I am not talking about a light natural shade, this is the hot pink (i am pale skinned) and lastly the eye shadow was so powdery that it would fall all over around the eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not the first time I am using make up. I am a professional dancer and used to make up a lot. But this product sucks even if you want to use it for a &amp;#34;regular evening out kinda make up&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I order this pallet on a Sunday night received it on Tuesday the packaging was great .Not one color was damage  the colors are beautiful and bright very nice pigment I will most definitely order again......</li>
    <li> Got it today, Lots of Pretty colors. I have the galaxy chic and it&#x27;s great, hoping this one would be too.</li>
    <li> This is my go to palette when my other BH palettes don&#x27;t have a color I need. This pallet has so many colors! The problem is I have so many other BH palettes and they are some repeat colors but overall they are good repeat colors :) Its not the best BH palette I own but I don&#x27;t regret buying it :)</li>
    <li> The delivery was fast and the package was safely delivered nothing was broken and it was the same thing as in the picture. I am very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the BH Cosmetics 120 palette (2nd addition). The palette is colorful and compact so it can be taken easily to everywhere you go. The shades are of high quality; I wear them sometimes 12 hours a day without having to renew them. Excellent value to the price paid for them!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an awesome product for the price. Although one shadow came broken I easily fixed it. All the colors are pigmented but to make them last you really do need a good primer.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughters birthday.  She is just getting into makeup and loves all the colors this set has.  They are small samples but good enough to play with when her friends come over for girly make overs.  The colors are fun !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers posted that theirs came in broken but not one was out of place, they did a good job packaging it for shipping.</li>
    <li> Its a nice eyeshadow pallete but some of the colors doesnt stay like you would think it should but I love the variety of colors . I dont wear the shadows all the time so I cant say for sure if its certain colors</li>
    <li> The product was wraped very good but one of the eyeshowes was broke ... But the quality is very good I love them ..</li>
    <li> at first i was iffy as to get it or not because i read a few bad reviews. about 3 colors came messed up due to shipping. but they are well pigmented. i love the way the colors look. you dont need much of them. great product for a great price... screw MAC cosmetics lol.. item would have received 5 stars but was damaged due to shipping :(</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors, high pigmented,perfectly wrapped, shadows were intact.. although i did have to wait about 2 weeks to receive them but i was in no rush so i didn&#x27;t mind at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All my makeup has to be waterproof,nothing stays on me for longer than 30 mins, so i was nervous and skeptical that these eye-shadows were not going to stay on..but i was pleasantly surprised! stayed on the whole night! they remind me of Mac&#x27;s eyeshadows...one thing though i used paint pot from mac as a primer which really helps any eye make up stay in place...one more thing you do need to know how to use these colors (lots of blending) otherwise if you just use the colors as is , they might be a bit too bright, so not highly recommended for beginners.</li>
    <li> Very well packaged with an amazing amount of care. Both the palette and the case were wrapped and the package was delivered to me quite quickly. It made it just in time for my friend&#x27;s birthday and totally made her night. I actually have been using my palette for almost a year and I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  When I bought it my husband asked if i was going to use all the shades.  its been 2 weeks since I purchased it and he is totally impressed with the look each time I put it on.  really impressed!!</li>
    <li> Purchased this product for Halloween. I absolutly LOVE all the colors. It lasts all night long; Does not fade away. This is a great product for the money I spent. I wear the colors daily. They are awesome. Great product!</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and none of the colors were damaged like I had read in other reviews. The colors are so beautiful and I love it! As soon as I got it I put them to use :-)</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m loving it! the colors are amazing - despite there&#x27;re some colors that are very similar to another, they are amazing.</li>
    <li> Arrived early, wasn&#x27;t broken. I got exactly what I ordered. Amazing long lasting color. I do do have to go over the color a few times, but the colors are super bright. Worth whey penny!!!</li>
    <li> I love this a lot. It doesn&#x27;t stick very well without a nice base, and I use NYX white so it shows a little brighter.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t realize it had another layer underneath, and was a little dissapointed how bright the colors were, but then I found they bottom palate and was very very happy with the darker more gentle tones.&lt;br /&gt;I like it a lot(:</li>
    <li> It arrived super fast and I was afraid some of the shadows would be broken but all was good. i have tried some of them and they have a lot of colour and look incredible!</li>
    <li> The colors are strong and vibrant and easy to work with. True to the pictures. I am very very happy with this palette!</li>
    <li> I loved the colors, i was scared for the shipping, because is such a delicate item, but, It really was well wrap and only two of the shades were broken, which is way better that what I expected.</li>
    <li> it came in one piece. .. love the colors</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Speaking As A Makeup Artist.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Have Absolutely Nothing But POSITIVE Feedback On This Product. BH COSMETICS NEVER Disappoints.!!!!! As A MUA, I&#x27;ve Tested Almost Every Product You Can Think Of, From (L.A. COLORS,WET N&#x27; WILD ETC.) To (MAC, DIOR, URBAN DECAY ETC). I PERSONALLY Use BH Cosmetics Color On Myself. And Save My Higher End &amp; Pricier Eye-shadows For My Clients..... I CONSTANTLY Get Asked About MY Eye Looks, And They Always Assume MAC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, BH COSMETICS, Paired With A Primer. Is Always High Pigmented, NEVER CREASES On ME. You Definitely Get Your Money&#x27;s Worth!!!!! I Promise You That.MUA</li>
    <li> My order arrived a bit later than expected so i took off a star for that, but thankfully it was all intact. The colors are pretty vibrant but u must use a primer!!  other than that it works well and lasts all day. For $25 it is a great deal.</li>
    <li> I heard about this eyeshadow palette from watching youtube and I am so happy I ordered it. It gives the opportunity to follow along with makeup tutorials and the color selection is great for trying new color combinations. There are shimmer, matte and frosted shades so the possibilities are endless.</li>
    <li> This is my 1st makeup pallete and I love all the colors!  The colors show up great with some primere and a base coat and for the most part blending is pretty easy!  The makeup can be a bit cakey at times, deppending on which color your using... But for the price it&#x27;s a STEAL!!!  I highly reccommend and I can&#x27;t wait to buy more of these paletts!</li>
    <li> Great colors, product and the shipping was ok...reasonably priced. my daughter loves it :) She also like the fact that it has a rather good size mirror on it as well...</li>
    <li> Win I ordered this pallet I was so excited it has gotten great reviews and it looks fabulous! When I received it I opened it with high expectations and they were met! The pigments are true to the picture and don&#x27;t wear off though out the day! Very pleased</li>
    <li> Delivery was bad! It got delivered to the wrong apt and we had to track it down.   It wasn&#x27;t like UPS or FEDX it was an unknown company.   Product is awesome! Colors are lovely! You just put on a little and it looks pretty. Not like other eyeshadows that u have to keep putting some on to show the color you want.   These Colors are hard to find and im glad I ordered them. Love it!</li>
    <li> I am enjoying the BH 120 color palette 2nd Edition. The colors are highly pigmented, the texture of the eye shadows are soft and easy to blend compared to other products I have used. What I like most about the product is the colors last throughout the day and they stay vibrant. I would say the cost and the quality of the product exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> Beautiful selection of colors. But they do not stay on. Even with an expensive eyelid primer. Matte colors were decent. But not great. I rather get my eyeshadow at the drugstore.</li>
    <li> The colors are vibrant.  The mix of shimmers and matte are perfect.  I can coordinate any oufit with my eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> Recieved this the other day.. fast shipping...Had the same issue as everyone else though had a few shades that had broke durring shipping . they were still useable it just made a big mess to clean up. As for the colors... Love them!! the pots were a little smaller than expected.. dime size.. but good pigmentation had a little more fall out that I would have liked but they blend well and the shimmer is very pretty.. sparkly but not glittery didnt crease too bad... I work 12 hour days so even with primer on my lids at the end my eye make up is creased :(  overall very happy with my purchase and would buy other pallets from this brand.</li>
    <li> I have to say that i love it!! The packaging was so secure i was impressed!!it was really taken care of and secured...i also love the colors! I feel like im in paradise when i use it! Plus the colors are reaply pigmented and i couldnt ask for anything else! Theres so many combinations! Thank you bh cosmetics!</li>
    <li> The colors arr gorgeous and normally they do not wear away quickly, which is always a plus! And for the price I didn&#x27;t expect them to be top-quality. They&#x27;re pretty good! There are some ups and downs though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I was slightly disappointed with the packaging. The colors aren&#x27;t well fastened in to the kit, per say. If you move the kit the wrong way in the slightest, a color smashes and is pretty much destroyed. I normally stand my kits such as this up in a little storage basket, but I&#x27;m nervous with this one! Other than that, the product is pretty good!</li>
    <li> This eye shadow set surprised my expectation. The colors were great very bright and show up extreamly well.only problem was one color had broke but all the other colors were in perfect condition. Great product for beginners.</li>
    <li> I really love this pallet. It has great pigment, and goes on evenly. It does crease over time, but using a good primer helps. However I have very oily eyelids and all eyeshadows crease on me eventually. I have recomended this pallet to many people, including my family and fellow make-up artist. I love the packaging, as much as the product. The only thing that I have found about it that is negative, it is not good to get wet. It works to apply, but when it dries it becomes chunky or rough on the surface, it still is usable but not as good. Still all together a great product.</li>
    <li> The colors could pop a bit more, but this was perfect for a school project. I think if they were used wet it would be more intense. The product arrived as expected, completely intact.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks BH you helped make a great project:)</li>
    <li> This a great eyeshadow set every color is pigmented and vibrant, especially on deep brown skin like mine. All you need is a good eyeshadow primer, not a base but a primer life the one from ELF which is only a $1 and you are good to go. I cannot wait until I can get the 3rd edition.</li>
    <li> They were broken colors but I had no choice but to keep them because I needed to use them for a job.</li>
    <li> The make up arrived broken and it is a gift for my daughter for Christmas.  She will not be very happy when she opens it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few yrs now. I know I know. It&#x27;s time to switch em out, but there are still colors I haven&#x27;t touched! Anywho, this is a great palette.</li>
    <li> No I don&#x27;t like it because was made in China, when they made the products, they used bad material to made it. They are bad for people to used it. I am afraid to use it o give to my family.</li>
    <li> Successful! Is the stuff that I&#x27;ve wanted for long time. Color variety are spectucaler for a woman, I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great price, amazing array of shades, what&#x27;s not to love?  I&#x27;m pretty much a novice at eyeshadow but even I can mix shades well with this kit.&lt;br /&gt;Eacg color is also a decent amount so will last for quite a while.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and the description is right on point. I would definitely recommend this to a friend. k</li>
    <li> This may not be the most expensive palette but i love the results. I always prime my eyes with Urban Decay but my eyeshadow lasts me all day although i haven&#x27;t tried in the hot summer months yet</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this. It is really good with lots of colors. I love it. And it is has a very nice case.</li>
    <li> I love this palette! It has amazing colors and is great for all occasions. It is also an amazing price!</li>
    <li> The product came quickly and nothing was broken the colors in the pallet are very pigmented and they show up very well with an eye shadow primer I recommend this to anyone looking for good eyeshadow had a very low cost</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s so many colors I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever have to buy eye shadow again! Literally every color of the spectrum which is awesome. Just what I wanted. BH Cosmetics last long, but my only complaint is that right after you put it on if you accidentally touch or itch your eye it smears and got all over my face. But after I had it on longer I had no issues.</li>
    <li> I bought this in January and got it for around $17. I had been looking for a decent palette and spent time reading reviews. I found this one had many good reviews and after some comparing and contrasting, I finally purchased it. I love it. It has matte and shimmer colors (my favorite) in one palette. Just recently a friend and I were using it and she got a beautiful rainbow-eyed look from the colors. The shadows are the size of about a penny and have a decent amount of pigment. It was packaged well and I received it in perfect condition. For the price, it truly is wonderful.</li>
    <li> So happy I decided to purchase this palette. It had so may great colors. Really enjoying it right now. It&#x27;s my first palette and it was really impressed.</li>
    <li> I simply adore this palette.  It has so many vibrant and fun colors!  Like many others, I do recommend using a primer, but I would do that with any eye shadow if you really want it to last.  I have had no issues with the matte or shimmery colors.  They all seem to blend very nicely and are very &#x27;true to form&#x27; pigments.  I loved it so much I bought another one go give as a gift.  It was shipped nicely, too...not one speck of a broken color when it came out of the packaging.</li>
    <li> I am 17 years old, and I want to be a makeup artist when I get out of high school. I bought the eye shadow pallette to practice with and I love it so much! I love the colors and I love how vivid they are when applyed. The only flaw is that when I open it, some of the colors pop out and I put them back in there circle.</li>
    <li> Got it for my wife and she loves it!</li>
    <li> For the amount of eyeshadow you get in these palettes and the price you can&#x27;t go wrong! The colors are well pigmented, running close with expensive department store brands. I bought one for my sister and one for myself. I still have plenty, my sister has ran out of hers in a little over a year! I really like the BHCosmetics eyeshadows. Everyone is different and some prefer to spend more money, but if I can save money and still get a comparable item then I am all for it and this was one of those purchases! I love the price as well you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price for all of the colors you get!</li>
    <li> I love this palette but when I received it I had 3 broken shadows. That was very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Goes on super bright. Stays on pretty well. Did not irritate my sensitive skin. AND SO MANY COLORS!</li>
    <li> Best eye shadow pallet I&#x27;ve ever bought. I love it! Totally worth it! Arrived safe and sound.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!! I will be ordering the other pallets as well! The colors are very vibrant and blend so well! Definitely a must have for makeup fanatics!!!</li>
    <li> This palette is awesome. I really like to match my eye shadows to the clothes that I wear each day. This palette has a wide range of colors. So happy that my husband purchased this one for me. Not only are they great colors but they last through out the day.</li>
    <li> The pigments are beautiful and the arrange of colors in this edition all compliment each other. Great deal for the amount of colors it comes with.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to all of my girlfriends.  I even bought one for my Step-daughter and she loves it too.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my Daughter &amp; she is at the age of experimenting with all colors. She watches videos on YouTube on how to apply eye-shadow &amp; she absolutely LOVES these eye-shadows! I wish she would let me take pictures of her eyes so I could share them on here, but she&#x27;s too shy for that.....right now anyways...lol.&lt;br /&gt;She actually wants all the series in these shadows, &amp; I will work on that as gifts are needed quite frequently. VERY VERY quick delivery, GREAT &amp; SAFELY packaged, &amp; price is AMAZING!!  &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I just got my palette 2nd Edition. I got it on time and nothing was broken. It was well wrapped. It has a variety of colors. It was in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I was expecting these colors to be a lot more pigmented than they were... I use this palette often but more for the nude colors as the brights really just are not as pigmented as I&#x27;d like them to be. Good for an eyeshadow amateur and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> The colors are very vibrant.There are greens, pinks, purples, browns etc. They look like the illustrated picture. This palette is similar to ML cosmetics palette, except this one has more browns. I use a primer before applying.</li>
    <li> With an exception of the color red (which is not present in the palette) , the 120 colors have almost every shade you would want. Plus, the pigment is strong and the colors dont run. Unfortunately, I managed to drop the palette once and the cover broke and a couple of colors popped out. Am having to keep it in a zip lock now to keep it clean. Other than that, I have a shade to go with very dress of mine!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome Pallet. The colors are true to their visual appearance. Very pigmented. I love this and it was a great purchase. Came intact. No cracks!</li>
    <li> a few of the eyeshadows came broken but for the price and quality and quantity its fine, not really a big deal, the eyeshadows smell a little funky though, like kids paint but whatever for a beginner its a good palette to start with, a lot of variety</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter to do Rainbow Dash costume last year.  She did her eyeliner like a rainbow.  See You Tube tutorial.  Worked great!  Nice set of colors.  She has used them other ways for every day and likes them!</li>
    <li> Great palette. It has colour imaginable</li>
    <li> The colors are great. I use Mary Kay face primer and use it for my eyes prior to the eye shadow and the colors last all day!!! Looking to see what other colors are available. Great product especially for the price!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived fast and the quality and color are as expected! Super pigmented :) also it was very very well packaged</li>
    <li> My girl loved it. It got here on time and was exactly what was described on the webpage, indeed a great product</li>
    <li> The model receiving this said the colrs are brilliant and better than she expected. Very pleased with the product choice.</li>
    <li> 다만 이중 한개가 깨져서 와서 ㅠ 친구에게 돈을 적게 받아야만 했었어요.&lt;br /&gt;그렇지만 전체적으로 색감 훌륭하고 너무 좋아서 다음에 또 살거에요;</li>
    <li> Great quality , but I ended up maybe using 15 out of the 120 colors . Some of the colors are so bright , they might come in handy for Halloween !  I probably could have ordered less colors but more usable ones !</li>
    <li> their so pretty!!! the colors are so pigmented and feel like there&#x27;s nothing on. many styles could be achieved with this. in all i love it. soon i will buy the other editions!!!</li>
    <li> Colors are exactly as the image.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product. Although when I did receive it, one of the eyeshadows was busted. Not too bad, though.&lt;br /&gt;It is also very good eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow palette is wonderful for creating different looks. It isn&#x27;t too heavy on the face. I would rev omen it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I wanted bright and vivid eyeshadows for a while after MAX Factor shut down, but couldn&#x27;t find any. I found this palette and don&#x27;t want to use anything else. This is the best makeup I have ever used and I love it!</li>
    <li> i just got this in the mail today and i LOVE IT!!! i love all the colors! very nice/bright and i know the colors will pop out more when i use my NYX white eyeshadow base. i recommend that eyeshadow base to anyone. works great with any eyeshadow you have. anyways when i was reading some of the reviews i was at first wasnt going to get this cause some were saying when they received this palette some of the colors were broken,etc....but i decided to take a chance anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when i got the box from ups and i opened it..it was packaged VERY NICELY and when i opened the BH Cosmetics box it was bubbled wrapped very good. i opened my palette and NONE of the colors were broken. everything looks very nice and brand new. i would recommend this palette to anyone that loves using and experimenting with different colors.</li>
    <li> This applies smooth, looks fantastic and the colours are just fabulous.  This palette is perfect for make - up lovers.</li>
    <li> Great product. Just make sure you look at all the different editions cuz there is a big difference between them all.</li>
    <li> Colors are as brilliant as advertised. Delivered right on time . Thanks !</li>
    <li> I purchased this set for a Halloween Makeup costume that I was doing. It has all the colors you need! The quality is great, the pigment is perfect. The colors are easy to blend and great to work with. Great price for all those possible color combinations too!</li>
    <li> This eye shadow has an amazing performance. I was actually interested in a MAC palette since all of the tutorials with shadow I watch use them. But I wanted to NOT spend 80+ dollars so I tried this one instead, it looks nearly identical other than the name of course. I must say, the pigments show up quite well. I personally pair it with eye primer (link included) and it makes it show up and last all the better. Even the yellow shows up well and I&#x27;m very light skinned! There is literally every color one might need and even there isn&#x27;t you could certainly mix one up. I am able to sport a different look every day now and I love it. I can&#x27;t say every color is astounding since it will take months to wear them all, but I have no doubt they are all 5 stars with pigment and lasting ability. If you aren&#x27;t a name brand junkie I definitely recommend this. You will have a longevity and great wear from it. I guess my only complaint would have to be that it is rather large, so it&#x27;s not exactly portable unless you have a giant purse. Although I myself don&#x27;t actually need to take it anywhere I&#x27;m sure many of you do make up for friends and family so that&#x27;s really the only issue! Have fun and express yourselves. [[ASIN:B00373DIYM e.l.f. Mineral Eyeshadow Primer elf]]</li>
    <li> I have not a single complaint about this pallette! It&#x27;s pigments are amazing and it has every color I could possibly need. WIll be looking into getting the 1st and 3rd edition to add to my collection.</li>
    <li> It was package great none of the colors were broken or out of place. Love the mixture of bright and neutral colors......</li>
    <li> i love the colors and how they stay put. the only thing that i dont like is that its kinda of hard to pull out the top part to get to the bottem one...</li>
    <li> Great colours.  Good staying power. Reviews of this product are good and live up to real thing. Enjoying the variety</li>
    <li> Thia palette is more than what I hoped for! Love the colors! I recomend buying it, shipping was fast and the packaged properly, no broken shadows here..I am considering buying more since I love this one so much :)</li>
    <li> I really like this product!  Some of the colors were a bit dark but so far it hasn&#x27;t been a problem!</li>
    <li> I just tried this on, and I can&#x27;t believe how pigmented it is! I am so excited to keep using it, and I want to buy more! Thank you for such a great product, at an amazing price!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my palette. It came with lots of variety for a great price &amp; very pigmented ! TRY IT !</li>
    <li> Very nice range of colors to be used in different occasions for different make ups. I think itdelivers its promise.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use all the colors, but the pigment is great and stays on pretty well. even better when you use a primer.</li>
    <li> But the dissapointing thing is says bh cosmetics its not comes cheap plastics cover case no mirrors like 3 or 4 shadows were broken and the eyeshdows mostly all look shimmery so the safest thing you could do if you want bh cosmetics buy it on their site.</li>
    <li> This palette is complete, it has beautiful colors, you dont need much to get the results you want.. I highly recomend it. It was wrapped securely, and it was delivered before the estimated time. I cried Bingo with this one</li>
    <li> HAVE TO USE TWICE TO APPLY NOT THAT GOOD</li>
    <li> Great product. Decent colors for dark skin</li>
    <li> Shipped well, After waiting for 6days, I just got mine this morning, no damage or whatsoever because of well sealed. after opening it, I tried in on.. Its pretty awesome. There&#x27;s a instruction on outer box how to use it, just follow it and you gonna have a glamorous eye shadow.. Its been 8hrs since I apply it and i havent reapply... I love this product. Two thumbs up ! &lt;3</li>
    <li> Hi, So I just ordered this item and by looking at everyone&#x27;s review I know that this will be a good item.</li>
    <li> I bought this set because a friend in cosmetology recommended it. I don&#x27;t really wear makeup, but when I do I prefer several options to meet my mood that ranges from neutral and modest to bright and crazy. This set more than met my expectations! I&#x27;ve used it for everything from everyday eyeshadow to costume makeup. The colors go on easily and are vibrant. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for quality eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> i am in love with this product, i like to play around with a neutral and bright color so its not too extreme but when you base your eyelid first (i use face foundation) it stays all day. love &amp; recommend</li>
    <li> Its came to me in one peiece, the box was in brand new shape. The colors are highly pigmented beautiful almost evry color u can think of. It came right on schedule, very happy with it !</li>
    <li> Great gift for my wives birthday.</li>
    <li> Comes with plastic &#x27;screens&#x27; to go over each layer/shelf of make-up, so they don&#x27;t smudge into eachother. I don&#x27;t use the mirror in the case, but it is firmly attached, so no worries of it falling off. The button to open the case is nice and firm, not a cheap latch like I&#x27;ve experienced in other eye make-up cases. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> My deaf finacee, she need buy mores color eyeshadow palette collections and she really a love work on the different brush her add color eyeshadow palette she can order in bh cosmetics too.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift. Everything was intact. The colors look so much better in person!! I know shes going to love it &#x3D;) thanks</li>
    <li> Some colors apply better than others, and I received mine with one color shattered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, great for the money. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> The best eyeshadow!!! This product is amazing.</li>
    <li> I loved it :) !!!!  The colors are just perfect and very pigmented! I seriously recommend this product! Can&#x27;t wait to get another one !!!</li>
    <li> THIS WAS NOT BH COSMETICS!!!!! The colors are nice and pigmented but I&#x27;m so upset that this is not what is displayed because I have the EXACT SAME PALLET I got from a hair show years ago by a company called Beauties Factory.</li>
    <li> I love the variety of colors the palette has, i feel in love with it right as i opened it! Everything was well maintained nothing was broken. I love doing my eyeshadow now happy buyer will purchase again in the future</li>
    <li> The palette came nicely packaged, shadows were intact and not cracked or broken, and it also arrived within 2-3 days.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting this product for some time. Finally got the chance to buy it, thought the price was a steal. The product arrived earlier than I thought. So that was a plus. I love the colors and the pigmentations of the colors. The only thing that I had a problem with was that one of the colors was broken. When I had opened the box with my items I could tell that there was a chance that the color would be broken, if I moved the box, I&#x27;m sure that the eyeshawdow palette could have moved around.</li>
    <li> EYE PRIMER, EYE PRIMER, EYE PRIMER! it will only work if you use an eye primer. I have three kinds of primers with different effects. I use a MAC paint pot in a skin color if you want a matt effect. The other option that works very well giving you a glossy effect is Covergirl Intense Shadow Blast in nude. Loreal Paris De-crease eye shadow base is another inexpensive option. Without eye primers, the pigment does not stay.</li>
    <li> So in love with these eye shadows-- the pigments are bright, use a primer and they will stay on all day and night. Will definitely order from BH again!</li>
    <li> The palette comes with an array of beautiful and unique colors to choose from, I haven&#x27;t gotten more eyeshadow since because I haven&#x27;t felt the need to. I love it for the price, package came fairly quickly and none of the product was broken or breaking. The only reason it&#x27;s not getting five stars is because some of the colors are not as heavily pigmented as others, which doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me.</li>
    <li> My BH  color palette is great because of the great colors they last all day, ladies you can&#x27;t go wrong ordering this palette.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not even legit, no mirror, no BH Cosmetics label. It was a complete waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was absolutely horrendous. When I took the palette out of the package at least 35 of the eyeshadows were cracked or in complete powder mixed with others. I swatched the ones that were still all in one piece and they&#x27;re not-so pigmented. I tried to form them back together with alcohol, but it was a waste of time, I ended up throwing it away.</li>
    <li> The payoff isnt as pigmented as I expected from previous reviews of this product for some of the matte colors, which is unfortunately why I purchased this product. I did also get the first version,  not the second as advertised.  I still love most if the colors and have to try a lot of them.</li>
    <li> I received my palette a week early and I was so excited about it that I had to whip out my makeup brushes and try them out right then. I LOVE MY PALETTE! It has so many colors, everything from bright to nudes, matte to shimmer. When I ordered the palette, I didn&#x27;t have high hopes that it would be of good quality because the palette cost less than $20. But OH BOY I was WRONG! I have found that BH Cosmetics 120 Eyeshadow Palette 2nd Edition had way less fallout then your regular store brand and costs less. It has so many vibrant colors that there is endless possibilities. Its a great buy and I strongly recommend it for everyone from stay at home moms to party girls!</li>
    <li> i love how this pallet has fun, smokey, and natural colors in it. MOST of the colors show up great and are pigmented but there are a couple i wouldnt use because the color comes out chalky which of course is not the sellers fault. besides that, no complaints! i would purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I order this Palette and it arrival is good condition, NOO eyeshadows was damage, like the las Order, so ask them to wrap it good and there will be NOO problems. love it.</li>
    <li> Although the set came smaller than i hoped, i was very happy with the many colors and shades available.i gave this to a friend as a gift and she loved it! i recommend buying this product. it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> OMG I just love makeup and this palette is wonderful. The colors are perfectly pigmented! Its so hard to even choose a color! I didn&#x27;t break out and I think this brand is vey good!</li>
    <li> Awesome beautiful super pigmented and vibrant colors for an amazing price! I&#x27;ve been using this palette every single day since it arrive to my house ! I swear you will love it !</li>
    <li> Worth the price.... but i think coastal scent its more picmented than bh cosmetics. I have both pallets and I compare afew colors they look exactly the same and coastal scents came out with more pocmented colors.eve n with out a consealer.</li>
    <li> I love this palette but on the downside when i received it in the mail i opened it and there was brown eye shadow dust all over the package as well as the box!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit disappointed the brown was cracked but its still a great palette especially for the price, the colors don&#x27;t show up as vibrant but eyeshadow primer helps ! In the end i am happy with this palette! So pretty i use it like everyday!</li>
    <li> The pigmentation is great!!! With the right tools it applies super smooth!!! All around amazing and well worth it!!! I would purchase every single edition if I could.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love THESE palettes! I feel like i scored big! These colors are so pigmented and beautiful!! When i got this in and saw them with my owned eyes i almost was in tears. Just amazing, even the shipping was really quick!! I ordered this tuesday night and got it by thursday afternoon on standard shipping!! I would definately recommend this to a friend!</li>
    <li> I bought this product a couple weeks ago and i must say that i am in love with this palette, the colours are bright and it does not take a lot for them to show on my skin. At first i used it without a primer and it was okay but when i used the primer it was just perfect. The eyeshadows were not shattered or smudged when i received it, and it was shipped to Jamaica. The seller packaged the item perfectly! Will buy another edition from this brand soon!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my make up pallette. Its easy to use and has a lot of colors thak you can chose from :)</li>
    <li> Muy buen producto. Buen Vendedor! La palette llego en excelentes condiciones, sin colores rotos hasta Venezuela. Gracias! Recomendado para futuras compras.</li>
    <li> Love the colors, very bold and a great variety!  It&#x27;s better to use a shadow base (NYX jumbo pencil in Milk works great) but you don&#x27;t HAVE to.  NONE of the colors were broken when I received them, each one is about the size of a dime, maybe a little bigger but plenty to get a colorful look.</li>
    <li> I received my palette on time &amp; triple wrapped. The colors are vibrant &amp; easy to blend. Definitely going to order more bh cosmetics in the future.</li>
    <li> My daughters aged 10 and 6 loved this 120 color eye  shadow palette. I think it is a great value for money.</li>
    <li> It was just what I wanted, great colors, great pigment...Arrived packaged well and safe..I am extremely satisfied with this awesome palette.</li>
    <li> I love this product! When I made up with them .. I was very surprise, because they look just like in the magazine..They look proffesional,because they are profesional..I love it !</li>
    <li> Purchased pallet about a month ago. I love it the it has every color you could imagine. The pigment is great. I actually like it better than MAC bc its inexpensive and shows up really well and lasts all day, but I.go use primer. Will definitely be purchasing again from this company. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This set just arrived today.  Please note that I did not have any broken pots.  It was bubble wrapped several times. I will post an update later.</li>
    <li> I always wanted one of these palettes and I finally ended up buying one and it was so worth it. It comes with 120 colors to play around with. I even found it cheaper on Amazon compared to the BH Cosmetics website so I caught a deal. I seen some reviews that they received broken eyeshadows but I did not have that problem at all. You do have to be very gentle because there are two levels and you can mix up the color so easily. Colors come out great but I suggest if you want the colors to be more pigmented to get NYX jumbo pencil in milk [[ASIN:B001TK4LM8 NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil Shadow Liner 604 Milk (SEALED)]]  or NYX eyeshadow base in white[[ASIN:B0030O3VRW NYX Cosmetics Eye Shadow Base, White, 0.21 Ounce]] it works best and worth every penny.</li>
    <li> The color are brilliant, so many colors! The colors are pretty bold without a base, pr an initial cover up or foundation. So I am sure with a base layer the color impact would be explosive. I love it. Definitely an upgrade in makeup for still an unreal yet reasonable price! I love it so much. Very happy with my purchase, I plan on buying these for my sisters. Love it! It is just a palate with no brushes, just in case you thought you wouldn&#x27;t need them. Mine were broken when I opened them. I bought all 3 editions at once, and the came all boxed separately in individual boxes, inside the boxes the were also bubble wrapped. I honestly think it may have happened after they were delivered to by front office, but it was upsetting. But still not a big deal! Well for me at least.</li>
    <li> Beautiful bright colors, love them, but the packaging sucked!  My case was inserted into a thin bubble wrap sleeve....and thats it! So of course 2 of my colors are broken up and spreaded all over the palette.  This did upset me a little, i feel that more bubble wrap should have been used to protect shadow and take up space inside box.  But i do love the shadow, ive been wanting a color palette for a long time so this was definately a great buy for me.</li>
    <li> The colors in this palette really compliments&lt;br /&gt;each other. Product goes on rich and smooth, and lasts all day.long. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> The product was rapped so well and everything was perfectly intact. I called to get more information and the service was very good and the people were nice. Awesome gift and colors!</li>
    <li> I live in the Caribbean and I&#x27;m brown in complexion. BH is very high pigment and carries an awesome range of colours. I love it. My product however, got damaged via shipping :(</li>
    <li> I love this eye shadow palette I will buy  this again when I need it</li>
    <li> Beautiful palette but it will help if you use a primer or eye shadow base first.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this the colors are very bright and there is a such a variety to choose from. You don&#x27;t really even need a base that&#x27;s how bright the colors are. Great especially for the price</li>
    <li> I received this palette just today and I carefully opened it the minute it came in! The packaging is exactly as the picture shows but it was mailed in an giant envelope! I was surprised thinking it would be in a cardboard box! Which leads me to opening it and finding 4, FOUR broken colors. I was very disappointed but the colors were great! It still bums me out but hopefully next time it will be better!</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful, about the size of a dime. The only downside to this set is that the colors come out easily. When I received the box, I opened it and there was makeup alllll over the place. The colors kept popping out too. BUT it&#x27;s cheap and contains some good colors, so its worth it.</li>
    <li> Great pallet of color. I use primer and a good base and all the colors so far show great and bright. I took away a star for poor packaging. Nothing broke but package could&#x27;ve been better.</li>
    <li> i loved all the pretty colors and the way they go on so smoothly, it was so pretty that my daughter wound up getting it from me lol</li>
    <li> Love all the colors. Love how there&#x27;s matte and shimmer in all colors. Some colors go on smoothly and others take a few tries to see color. But I still love them. Wish the lid was a mirror ;)</li>
    <li> Shimmery and beautiful! Package arrived on time as stated and in great condition! I have worn it twice and the colors lasted all day!&lt;br /&gt;Its a little heavy and bulky but not that big of a deal when you have all these choices of color! needed a little more neutrals so the reason i gave it a 4.</li>
    <li> Love the makeup and the name brand I like how it apply on the face love the fact how fast i received it. Thank You</li>
    <li> It arrived fully on time and I had no time to spare opening up the box and getting to use this beauty! I found that 1 green eyeshadow(E.S.) had cracked, but I could definitely live without it.&lt;br /&gt;It has a variety of matte and shimmer, cool and warm, &amp; neautral to vibrant. Some people have trouble blending the matte ES but I didn&#x27;t have the same problem, they blending really well with the other colors. I&#x27;m a freelance makeup artist and this has enabled me to practice more with color.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend purchasing because for what you get the price is insane; I love this palette, now its a staple in my MU kit. If you want to check out some of my work follow me on iG: @/makeupbykaylannie !</li>
    <li> Has every color you can imagine. Easy to open and use, the only thing I&#x27;d change would be to have the colors on both sides and the mirror underneath. I don&#x27;t use the mirror as I have one on my table, so opening up the kit like a book would be great. Otherwise, nice product, has not irritated at all and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> so many beautiful, vibrant colours! i like that there are shimmer and matter, most palettes are either/or. i really like this</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! I love the make up... It&#x27;s so pigmented like the other reviews said. I have months of doing different color combinations.... Sooooo excited I haven&#x27;t even touched my other shadows... Will buy and already have bought other make up products from Bh.</li>
    <li> Was so excited to receive this but sadly, bh did not package it well enough and one eyeshadow was broken upon opening :( The variety of colors for the price is great. These shades do not appear to be super pigmented so if you buy this just be sure to have some make up setting spray to apply to your brushes before applying this eyeshadow. I&#x27;m on the fence about buying anything else from bh because of the packaging issue..definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for pricier items but $18 for 120-1&#x3D;119 colors, I&#x27;ll take it. Also, great palette for beginners or those wanting test out different shades :)</li>
    <li> LUV THA COLORS!!!!! ITS WAS A GREAT X-MAS GIFT FROM MY HUSBAND HE KNOWS I LOVE PALETTES WITH LOTS OF COLORS</li>
    <li> This is such a fun set. It&#x27;s got so many colors! It&#x27;s perfect for anything-- I can wear hot pink and silver for my best friend&#x27;s New Years Eve bash, and a soft aqua for date night. There&#x27;s a color for every occasion! Just be careful, the pigment is long lasting-- it took me a day, plus a shower and multiple times scrubbing and rinsing, to finally get the color off. You don&#x27;t need a lot, but it&#x27;s still awesome!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my teenage sister and she loves it. None of the shadows were broken and the selection is great.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s an amazing palette for an even better price! I bought it as a gift for a secret Santa and she loved it.</li>
    <li> This palette was so worth the extremely low amount that I paid for it!! The colors are amazing and they are very well pigmented! I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this purchase, and very glad that I took the chance on this palette after reading the reviews.</li>
    <li> bought this for a friend of mine and she absolutely loves it. she&#x27;s now has enough colours to play with</li>
    <li> Just bought this for my college-age daughter for Christmas after reading many reviews on here for similar items.  We had seen a few at department stores and they had many blushes and lip colors with them, which is not what she wanted.  This arrived very quickly in perfect condition and she LOVES it.  120 colors to play with and mix and match.  For the price, even the small shipping charge, this is very worth it and a gift I would buy again for a woman who loves variety in shadows.  Some colors in here are VERY bright, so not for everyone, but for the young and/or daring this is ideal.  Two thumbs up from our house!</li>
    <li> I love this palette! There are so many colors and the price is great also. The shadows have good pigmentation on their own, but look even better and last longer with a primer. (I use too faced shadow insurance) This is my first time using a bh cosmetics product and I can honestly say I will be ordering again. Only issue I had was that it took a while to get the product. I opted for standard shipping (2-7 days) but it took two weeks for me to get the palette. However; it was worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I feel of the shadows are very good quality, so many colors that will last me for years...I only use them when I got out on a special date with my boyfriend and girl&#x27;s night out. I want to buy more colors and will do so from BH Cosmetics!!!</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t even need an eyeshadow primer for these to stay on! The only bad thing is that you might need to apply much product to achieve the necessary colour</li>
    <li> The beast buy ive done so far love it n enjoyed it happy i bought it very good prouduct as well</li>
    <li> I bought this palette out of curiosity. I watched product reviews on YouTube, and it seemed like a good product at an amazing price. The shadows are chalky and there&#x27;s a lot of fall out. I don&#x27;t know for sure, but I suspect that the shadows contain harmful ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I bought a Tarte palette with an orange-gold-pink shadow, and it looks amazing on me. I thought there might be more colors that I should try, which is why I bought this rainbow palette. I also thought it would be fun to do sports themed and holiday inspired makeup looks. I&#x27;ll use these shadows for Halloween and other events when face painting is appropriate. However, I won&#x27;t use these shadows on my eyes, because they&#x27;re low quality and may contain harmful ingredients.</li>
    <li> I love love love that it arrived well in advance of the estimated delivery time! unlike some of the other unpleasant reviews left, my eyeshadow arrived in stellar condition... all shadows were in tact, and the colors LOOK just as amazing as they do in the photo ( I just got it 1/2 hour ago, so I have not had a chance to apply any of them). My eyeshadow came in a BH cosmestics cardboard box and the case is also labled BH cosmetics and comes with a mirror... Judging on appearance and packaging, I&#x27;m in Love with this product and my expectations of its utility is just as high, cant wait to apply them</li>
    <li> I love this palette of colors! The shadows are good quality, the shadows stay on all day! I will be ordering another palette soon!</li>
    <li> It arrived with the makeup crumbling away.  As I lifted it out of the package 2 more colors broke in half (horizontally).</li>
    <li> I have been looking in store for something like this I&#x27;m so in love with it so many colors well worth the money</li>
    <li> package came in less than a week, nothing was damaged. Case it came in is great, easy for on the go although its slightly large due to all the colors. Ive never used an eye shadow primer and the color stays on all day. There is matte and shimmer colors. Love it!! Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Some shades are better than the others</li>
    <li> Great pallet and absolutely love it but a few of the colors got broken in delivery. Was abut disappointed that the entire pallet was covered in eyeshadow dust very messy.</li>
    <li> love love my main palette</li>
    <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good pallet for the price. Some colors are more pigmented then others as long as you wear a primer the eye shadow will last all day. The shipping was fast and the product came in great shape.</li>
    <li> Every freakin color ever born! -_- Stunned.</li>
    <li> Brilliant colours and lasting power...a must buy</li>
    <li> Love This Palette, Great Color Pay Off.</li>
    <li> Lots of colours but they aren&#x27;t vivid enough for me. This is a starter pallet</li>
    <li> AWESOME! Beautiful colors, long lasting, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Love it its affordable it blends well colors are amazing. Its just awsome</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. It shipped fast and nothing was broken! The packaging was great as well! I recommend this. The only complaint is that the colors dont really show up good on my skin because im pretty dark skinned but its still pretty and i just have to add layers of the color!</li>
    <li> Bellisimos los colores, puedo jugar con la gama de paletas que trae, puedo hacer desgrades y pinta muy bien, espero que saquen uno para carteras</li>
    <li> great product! lovely colors last all day long! I would recomend this to everyone! very inexpensive for the quality of the product!</li>
    <li> The colors are so highly pigmented, I have a very dark African American complexion and it shows up great on me even without primer! The colors are so beautiful and high quality, I love this palette so much!</li>
    <li> I absolutly love this product!!!! the shadows are vibrant easy to apply!!  the colors are just so fun!! They really do make your eyes pop!!  I would recemend this and have to everyone that I know!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Ladies if you are looking for a long lasting highly pigmented eyeshadow palette, then look no further! This palette has every color of the rainbow available for every taste. I was extremely pleased how the eyeshadow was shipped. BH cosmetics specifically stamped FRAGILE HANDLE WITH CARE! on the box and if that wasn&#x27;t enough they took extra care in wrapping the palette in two layers of bubble wrap and this cardboard mesh type paper around the box, so no shadow was damaged. Thank you so much BH cosmetics for the extra care you put in to shipping my palette. My only conplaint would have to be that you absolutely NEED an eyeshadow primer before applying these colors as they will not stay and will fade off but I was smart and bought a NYX jumbo eyeliner in MILK and so far they are staying on beautifully.I will definitely be purchasing more eyeshadow palette from this company!</li>
    <li> Not pigmented enough for me but will still use.</li>
    <li> luv it .... came super quick , packaged great no shadow was broken so super great!!!!!! luv the colors they are  beautiful</li>
    <li> Grest pigment, works even better with a eyeshadow primer.&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is the packaging, some shadows were broken :(&lt;br /&gt;But great product overall !</li>
    <li> Best eye shadow I have spent my money on the colors are so bright on me and the blend together so well love it</li>
    <li> I like the way they package the palette. The colors are so vibrant and the variety was awesome. It makes it so easy to chose different color combinations,</li>
    <li> daughter love&#x27;s this!!! she has worn her make-up in a different way, everyday since she recieved it! so many possibilities!!!</li>
    <li> One of the colors was broken, but it does it&#x27;s job when I use a high quality base. Colors are vibrant and go a long way.</li>
    <li> I received the product in great condition.  Being an international customer I was a bit worried but BH secured the package properly.  The actual case is  chic and sleek, I am impressed.  The pigmentation is great for the price. I have dark skin and have had problems with some makeup showing.  This palette, both matte and shimmer, goes on smoothly and the colors are just as vivid on the eye.  The shimmer is not overdone and can be used for professional wear.  The range of colors is pretty impressive and not repetitive.  It blends easily and the vast number of colors allow customers to blend properly.  However, primer should applied prior to use to enjoy the beauty of the palette.  Having used higher- end brands, I must say that the palette is a great alternative and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Every year when Halloween comes around, my sisters and I get crazy with our makeup. YouTube videos and Chinese food is what it&#x27;s all about. San Antonio&#x27;s Zombie Walk is our highlight and we have fun with this gruesome art. I bought the 120 color set for that reason. It holds a lot of the colors that are needed to make some good zombies.&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, I also sometimes use it for its traditional purpose and like the brown shades.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and was intact. I love all of the colors in the palette and would definitely recommend this for someone who is looking to get more color into their makeup collection.</li>
    <li> It shipped quickly and in perfect condition, no damage. I use this every single day, there are so many colors to choose from and they wear so well! Suggest using a good quality primer when using these though to enhance the pigment and make them wear longer. They only stay on about half a day without primer, and are much duller.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product .. it has lots of colors shimmer and matte. Ofcourse with any eye shadow use a primer ...the product arrived on time in great condition I love it and so do my customers and its very affordable I plan on getting all additions :)</li>
    <li> I will be ordering another palette. Highly pigmented fun colors!! Fast shipping. Love this palette!! Very affordable no ashy colors. All colors are true to its color. Great communication.</li>
    <li> Colors not very pigmented as advertised wouldn&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> I thought I would really like this but I&#x27;m not really a bright colors person and I thought there would be more neutrals. It is good creamy eyeshadow though and it stays a long time. If you like brights, go for it!</li>
    <li> very good product 2 colors broke but it still functions well.&lt;br /&gt;use with a white base or eye primer. xoxo</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this palette to death. I&#x27;ve had it for 6 months now and I&#x27;m still in love. I&#x27;ve used every color and the only complaint I can find is that the whites are not high pigmented and it barely shows up when I apply it.</li>
    <li> OMG I JUST RECEIVED MY PALLET AND ITS AMAZING I LOVE IT AND DONT REGRET GETTING. SHIPPING WAS FAST GETTING THE THIRD EDITION NEXT IF YOU GUYS NEED MORE INFO ON IT FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME I HAVE NOTHING BUT GOOD THINGS TO SAY ANOUT THIS ITEM.</li>
    <li> great makeup , stays well and good quality .. works great with eye primer !!!  im a makeup artist its so convienant to carry with all the colors for my clients</li>
    <li> THe package arrived on time but was not in the best condition. One of the shadows had been damaged that caused it spill into the rest of the colors and package. Overall, I am still happy with it!</li>
    <li> It came in really fast and the eyeshadows are great, really soft and pigmented BUT when the came in, one of the eyeshadows was broken. Which wasn&#x27;t surprising to me because the item was packages carelessly. There was only one sheet protection over the product.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift for a friend and she loves it!! It goes on so nice!! Excited to buy more palates :D best of all affordable!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an inexpensive, extremely pigmented eyeshadow palette, I highly recommend this palette.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are all pigmented. While applying the eyeshadow with an eyeshadow brush, there was no fall out. I&#x27;m very impressed with this palette. I will most likely try different palettes and products from bh cosmetics.</li>
    <li> IM VERY PICKY when it comes to eye shadow, i&#x27;ve used mac &amp; even Victoria Secret eye shadow as well among other drugstore brands and I have to say the variety of blues &amp; greens are truly my favorites! the colors in the pallet are easy to blend &amp; im no make up artist but it alows me to look like one! you dont have to apply a whole lot either!I am caramel complexion  &amp; these colors pop on my the skin like nobodies business!</li>
    <li> Unfortunate some of the spot eyeshadow was damage, and the rest was in good condition, however the item was nice and it’s as the display picture. thank you</li>
    <li> OMG!!! I love this. Very pigmented. They took extra precaution on packaging. Thumbs up on that. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Yes this makeup is perfect and the colors&lt;br /&gt;Are awesome.&lt;br /&gt;The colors last all day long 👍</li>
    <li> I recieved my 2nd edition palette in one week after I ordered it and the colors was beautiful it had lots of shimmers as well as matte colors very pigmented and its very affordable and I will definately be ordering from this company always!!</li>
    <li> It is an excellent Cosmetics 120 Color Eyeshadow Palette. I love it because it is a 120 Color Eyeshadow Palette and I love makeup.</li>
    <li> Beautiful . fast delivery ! I was very pleased with my B.H palette.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my friend birthday , she is in love with it and the pigmentation is excellent</li>
    <li> These eye shadows are great!! They come on smooth and look great!!</li>
    <li> I just received my package today. It was hard trying to decide which one chose. i selected this one and the 5th edition. I am looking forward to using both.  There are tons and tons of lovely colors. I figured if I get the sets and not purchas 2 packs for $5+ each this would be a much better buy. I lover earth tones and the 5th edition has about 12 shades. Also, there was 1 broken in each kit. But I guess it couldn&#x27;t be helped. No reason to return it because the corner where they broke may happen again. By the way if you need any assistance on how to apply the wonderful gorgeous shades of eyeshadow to to Youtube and put in how to apply eyeshadow. you will get every thing you need, and I can&#x27;t wait. Good luck and enjoy.</li>
    <li> BH Cosmetics is a great line. I love the colors and the fact that it&#x27;s long lasting. My family is now into BH cosmetics as well...We are always checking for new products and giving feedback to each other.. They have colors that are great for every season and skin tone... Ladies at work are always talking about how pretty my eyes look and to buy them some (as a gift)... Make great gifts and also affordable!</li>
    <li> this was a great price and was shipped in great time! I really enjoy these eyeshadows! I love all the colors!</li>
    <li> NICE MAKE UP i do like the color the texture and also them seems to be good quality. i hope arent people disappointed about it!</li>
    <li> This makeup palet has amazing pigment just be sure not to go to crazy with it or else it&#x27;s too overpowering.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few months ago and I love it! I&#x27;ve owned other 120 pallets and this one is in my top 5. the price is great and the pigment in the colors is great... also it doesnt fade or come off in the middle of the day.</li>
    <li> It actually took longer to arrive to my house than expected. But I love the product. of course its best to use a good eye primer with any eye shadow. That being said, this pallette is very highly pigmented. And it says on the whole day and into the night. I am very happy with my BH cosmetics pallette. I just have to find someplace to put it where it won&#x27;t get broken? :)</li>
    <li> When I ordered a makeup pallette I did so because I wanted to have&lt;br /&gt; 1)all the colors i could need without havin to buy many individual ones as I had done in the past.&lt;br /&gt;2) modern vibrant colors as well as nude and smokey shades, (no pale, ugly, awkwardly arranged on their palette,colors.)&lt;br /&gt;3) not only colors but also a Good quality products with a velvety finish and high pigmentation for optimum blend-ability,  otherwise it would defeat the purpose Of me buying it.&lt;br /&gt;4) all of these colors intact upon arrival, packaged with the knowledge of the fragile nature of palletes.&lt;br /&gt;My greatest fear that kept me from purchasing it online was that I would end up with a cheap \\&quot;Christmas gift for little girls\\&quot; palette.&lt;br /&gt;Well I am glad to say that when this arrived I was able to have a sigh of relief because each one of my worries had been addressed.&lt;br /&gt;The box in which it came was heavy because of the enormous amount of precautionary tissue bubble wrap and paper that was used to keep the makeup intact.&lt;br /&gt;The eyeshadows were vibrant and well organized, velvety and blend able.&lt;br /&gt;If used with an eyeshadow base the colors stay for a very very long time and this is something I already do even with my Mac eyeshadows.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that I don&#x27;t want to carry the palettes with me anywhere because I don&#x27;t want them to crack so they stay on my makeup counter where I already do my makeup anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I am buying another one of these for my sister :)&lt;br /&gt;if u are serious about makeup, I recommend this palette (the second version)over all others.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with how nice this item was.  The colors are beautiful and plentiful.  Now I have all the choices I would ever need to choose from!</li>
    <li> This is a cool palette of eyeshadow. The colors are rich and pigmented, that is the dark colors. The lighter colors you have to pack on the color or layer it. If you use to much, all you will get is a shimmer of color with hardly any distinction between colors. Not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pots are dime sized so you don&#x27;t get much product.  If you are using it for personal use then I would recommend to have it. If you are using it professionally I would say no. But I like it none the less.</li>
    <li> I have to say this surpassed my expectations. I ordered this one afternoon and recieved it literally the next morning. The colors are very vibrant and the palletes were in meant condition when I recieved them. For such a great price I wasn&#x27;t expecting these to be super amazing, but a little goes a long way with these. The shimmers are brilliant and the mattes are just as well. I would recommend this pallete to anyone who loves color and is looking for a good price. :3 Awesome job to the overnight shipping! I didn&#x27;t even pay for fast shipping...I was going to wait the two weeks... Love it~!</li>
    <li> loved this product it was exactly what i wanted and expected. the colors are great and very pigmented. i used it everyday</li>
    <li> This product was worth every penny spent on it and more.  The colors were just as pictured if not better. There are lots of colors and you can have lots of fun playing around and experimenting with different looks.</li>
    <li> Love the colors in this Palette.  I also love that it is compact and travels well.  When i go on a trip i don&#x27;t have to try to figure out what color eye shadow i will need to take with me.  With this palette i have all the colors at my fingertips.</li>
    <li> great everything i expected. came on time and was neatly wrapped. great product for the price. i would buy again</li>
    <li> geat price and fast shipping. Pigments are great, seem to show more if you have shadow primer or a white shadow on first. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Love this makeup the colors and everything great product.</li>
    <li> So many colors and bright I use this for when I&#x27;m doing a photo shoot a good product!! A must buy</li>
    <li> I love the wide variety of colors, but was disappointed that a few arrived cracked an falling out of their spot in the case. It seemed to be well packaged, but maybe it needs another layer of packing? Not sure; But I am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> The colors are very pigmented on my skin. I&#x27;d say for reference my skin tone is a little darker than caramel. I&#x27;m very happy with the shadows.</li>
    <li> Some colors are great, but some are chalkey in texture and the color payoff is lacking. Most colors are decent.</li>
    <li> IF you LOVE makeup like myself then you cannot go wrong with this palette!!! Has all the colors you need in one...whether you want a conservative daytime look or a spiced up night time look, you can get them all with this palette!!!</li>
    <li> It does the job. The shimmer colors are the best. And you must apply a primer before using unless it will fade away and/or look cheap.</li>
    <li> Nice product, the product is the same as the description and arrive without damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are nice as I was expected!</li>
    <li> I had this on my Amazon wishlist for maybe 2 months before buying. I&#x27;m 26 years old and JUST started getting into makeup!!!! Sad I know lol. I&#x27;m not a complete makeup buff because I feel as though I still don&#x27;t need that much but I have come to be obsessed with eyeshadows, lipstick, and lip glosses. When I saw these 120 colors my eyes lit up. So many colors to choose from! After ordering and counting down the days until I&#x27;m suppose to receive them... and tracking my package lol.. the day finally came to receive them. They were suppose to arrive this past Saturday. I waited 2 hours outside for the mailman *I live in Alabama and it&#x27;s hot here around this time of year*. The mailman didn&#x27;t come and then it was a substitute mail carrier. I called the post office and they said they deliver sometimes as late as 7:30pm. I finally got  my mail *had ordered something else off Amazon that was coming at the same time as my eyeshadows* and I got that package.. but no eyeshadows. I called again and they said the mail carrier would come back to deliver it and that sometimes they don&#x27;t realize there is more than one package. I went back to my house and kept tracking my package. Here it was 7:50pm and it still said out for delivery. The post office was closed at that time. I was confused as to why it said it was still out for delivery. 9:05pm came around and when I tracked my package again, it said attempted delivery and a notice was left. I was a little irritated but excited. I checked the mailbox Sunday... AND NOTHING!!! NOT EVEN A NOTICE!!!!! I was frustrated at this point. I honestly thought since it was a female substitute that she took my eyeshadows! *I can laugh about it now but I was serious at the time LOL*. Monday came and I went to the post office with my I.D. and tracking number in hand. The post office worker went to the back to find my package... then came back and said he couldn&#x27;t find it. I told him to check again because I know it&#x27;s back there. He went to check again and sure enough he found it. The box was definitely too big to fit in my mailbox *the case could have fit perfect but not the package box it came in*. Then he gave me another package. I ordered something that was suppose to come Tuesday and thought it came early. I got in the car and tore open the box and stared in amazement....at the paper it was wrapped in. I&#x27;ve never seen wrapping paper like that before and it reminded me of my fishnet dress I own except my dress was white. *random observation...moving on*. Well after unwrapping it from what seemed to be 3 boxes worth of paper... I got to my eyeshadows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Condition of Product: The case was beautiful and I love how you have to push the button to open it. This means it will stay securely closed. When I opened it, my eyes carefully scanned over each eyeshadow color. I then came upon the purple. The purple was broken *sad face* but it was still usable. Then I counted and noticed that was only 60 colors. I was looking around wondering where the other 60 was. After inspecting the side I saw a little hole where your suppose to place your nail and lift up. Up under the shadows I was looking at, was the other 60. All 60 of those were in perfect condition, none of those were broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprise Bonus?: Ok I&#x27;m not sure what I did to deserve this next mention or if it was by accident but the other package...was ANOTHER 120 eyeshadows! It was the same thing I ordered. I checked my orders and sure enough I ordered only 1 set but they sent me a 2nd order of the same set. I gave the 2nd set to my 15 and 17 year old cousins because they are just getting into makeup too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEAR A PRIMER FIRST: I can&#x27;t stress this enough  because if you want it to last longer and bring out the colors more, use a eyeshadow primer first. I use De-Crease Eyeshadow Base by L&#x27;Oreal Paris. So far I&#x27;ve did a ombre green and that lasted me from 6:40am until I took it off around 7pm that night. It still looked as though I just put it on when I went to take it off. The next one I did was a pink hued smokey eye. My boyfriend went crazy over that look on me LoL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HEAT WARNING: Even with a primer, in humid conditions like here in Alabama, the shadows still creased. My other shadows do it as well when it&#x27;s really humid. Maybe I need to apply more primer before putting it on in weather conditions like that but just a usual application of primer won&#x27;t keep them from creasing if it&#x27;s very humid outside or your in a humid environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I&#x27;m loving these colors! There are so many different looks I can create from just the FIRST 60 set of shadows. Just imagine how many can be created if you choose from the full 120!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side Note: When my cousins opened their set that I gave them, all the shadows were in perfect condition....except the purple. So it wasn&#x27;t just mine, I&#x27;m starting to think the purple breaks easily or it was the delivery to the post off? I don&#x27;t know but it&#x27;s still usable, the purple in mine and theirs are just broken a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Note: These don&#x27;t burn my eyes after wearing them for long hours. My other eyeshadows tend to burn my eyes if I wear them for too long and to this day I&#x27;m not sure why...but these BH Cosmetic eyeshadows don&#x27;t hurt nor burn my eyes and that&#x27;s a definite plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend them to others?? YES!!!!!!!!!!!t it on when I went to take it off. The next one I did was a pink hued smokey eye.

    <li> I dont really like it because its very flaky and in order for it to stay on  my eyelids i need to make it into a past with my primer and its not worth it to me because a lot of the colors are the same and the mat colors are very mat there is still a hint of shimmer to them.</li>
    <li> There is such a wide range of colors, you can find a color to go with anything, it is a really nice set.</li>
