<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Would not allow me to shave in a circular motion as suggested, even with pre electric shave products. Moving with the grain didnt remove much hair at all. Moving against the grain felt like it was ripping every single hair out. Returned it for a Remington F5 5800 which was about the same price. The F5 can shave against the grain with no hair ripping, no irritation, and gets much closer.</li>
    <li> After only 5 minutes of shaving the performance of this razor drops dramatically. After using it for a month now I find that it fails in many ways.  Power is a major issue.  The very sound of the motor seems weak.  This area for improvement is evidenced by the result of comparing this brand new razor to one that is three years old, a Norelco.  The Norelco, with the original blades, simply cuts better.  This razor does glide smoothly, yet perhaps this is due to the lack of cutting ability.  It cleans easily and is lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> love it, really like how it showes the amount of battery left before needing charged</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fiance. He loves it and said it works great.</li>
    <li> Received wrong product, different number, different features.  item received used, not new.</li>
    <li> Great shaver, holds a great charge and makes a clean shave. My old shaver broke and I was excited for this one to come in the mail. My anticipation was justified. Does a great clean shave.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome. I love it :)</li>
    <li> Pros: Comprehensive battery indicator, small size of the wall charger, razor replacement price is reasonable&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Does not shave well, shaver head seems like cheap plastic/falls off easily when opening, VERY LOUD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I owned bottom-of-the-line Norelco shavers for 15+ years and I was sick of it dying on me on trips where I&#x27;d forget my charger. Finally, after the plastic that holds the razors in busted, I was determined to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I thought I&#x27;d try this Remington that is about the same as the price-point of the Norelco ($30-35) and the basic same features with the added bonus of the charge indicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months later I&#x27;m looking to buy a Norelco again. As great as the Remington&#x27;s battery indicator is, it doesn&#x27;t make up for all the complaints I constantly get about how stubbly I am. Maybe if I was going for the dark complexion, this wouldn&#x27;t be a problem. Oh and boy is it loud. I wasn&#x27;t ready for that. As for the problem where my Norelco finally broke, I&#x27;d say the build quality of the Remington&#x27;s shaver head is about the same. The plastic housing may be a little more cheap feeling and easily falls off so I&#x27;m concerned it may end up falling off and breaking anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the travel bag and wall charger it comes with. The battery holds up very well. But I simply can&#x27;t get over how poor the shave is. In the end, this product had one job and it couldn&#x27;t deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if I could just figure out whether it&#x27;s worth spending more than $40 on an electric razor...</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband as his facial hair grows really fast but he likes to be clean shaven.  This was his first electric shaver and he played around with it until he got the hang of it.  But overall he found it just didn&#x27;t have enough power to cut the hairs close enough to the skin and not irritate his skin at the same time.  He said he&#x27;d just rather go back to manual shaving for a better cut than deal with this nosy, heavy thing everyday.</li>
    <li> My husband loved the electric razor! It is easier for him to use than a regular razor.</li>
    <li> I replaced my old Reminton R845 razor with this one.  It does a good job.  I would like to have a case for it when traveling, but otherwise it was a good value.</li>
    <li> The head of the razor seems loose and makes a shaking noise, but it works okay and I guess that&#x27;s the way it is suppose to be.  I am disappointed that the quality of the razor is not a little better.</li>
    <li> Get the LAST OF THE OLDER MODELS.They have Titanium tipped blades, and they stay sharp for a long time. The newer version &#x27;may&#x27; be as good, but it doesn&#x27;t have the Titanium blades of the older model. And, by the way, if you soak your face with Mennen brand pres-shave, and also drip some on the blades and leave them wet, you get a fast, close, comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Hands down the worst shave of my life. I&#x27;ve owned numerous Remingtons and Norelcos over the decades. Have essentially never been a blade shaver. Every day now I&#x27;m guaranteed pain. Startling pain. Turn the thing on and it sounds like the most under-powered motor ever in a shaver of mine. It just loves to grab and pull, grab and pull and grab and pull. Can&#x27;t be the blades I figure. It has been doing this since day one and the blades are \\&quot;titanium coated dual track blades\\&quot;. Sounds impressive. Hurts like hades. I&#x27;ve owned the shaver for three months now, and it&#x27;s the same routine every single day. To say that I don&#x27;t look forward to shaving would be an understatement. I&#x27;m nervous just wondering when (not if!) the first grab and pull will occur. I never have to wait more than a few seconds, and this repeats itself at least a half dozen or more times per shave. I&#x27;ve tried every variation of shaving known to man in an attempt to stop the pain. All to no avail. I keep the unit clean. I keep it well charged. I&#x27;m nice to my shavers cuz I want them to last. I think Remington has cut some serious corners here as it relates to the motor....a complete piece of junk in my opinion. I am routinely in the middle of a shave with a clean and fully charged shaver. Suddenly the motor starts to lug at half its&#x27; already unimpressive speed. Each time this happens, I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27; s ready to die. I check out the charge indicators on the handle and they&#x27;re all lit up green. Did I get a lemon? I don&#x27;t know. Quite a few high ratings for this shaver, so I don&#x27;t know what to think. Either way I&#x27;m screwed. An expensive hassle to return it to the manufacturer for repair, and then what do I use for the weeks it&#x27;s gone? Does the thing even need repair? Probably should break down and send it in. I very rarely leave a negative review, and I would hate to have done so if in fact this really is a fine product -- except for the one I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the time being, this has put me off Remingtons completely -- and I have been loyal to that brand like none other.ns completely -- and I have been loyal to that brand like none other.</li>
    <li> For the money it is a good shaver. I have not used an electric razor in the past but this is good if you are in a hurry.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Smooth shave.  Easy to clean. Easy to recharge. Ergonomic--fits comfortably in your hand. Have been using Remington for years.  Always dependable.</li>
    <li> I bought this for our son because every time he came home to visit, he&#x27;d use my husbands. He said he&#x27;s got 2 very expensive shavers at home that don&#x27;t even begin to compare with this one.</li>
    <li> I was a big remington shaver fan. In the past, I got a good shave for a relatively cheap price. I have bought $200 &amp;#34;highly rated&amp;#34; shavers in the past  and found that I was getting better shaves with these $30-$40 Remington Shavers. I bought this model expecting the same. Although it started well, within 2 months, the shaver acted as if it were losing power and gave a poor shave. Even fully charged, it seemed to &#x27;Kvetch&#x27; along. I just couldn&#x27;t handle it anymore and I moved on.</li>
    <li> bought this for my son.  he said the best razor he has ever had.  he is 53 and has tried many.</li>
    <li> I was looking for the Remington R-600 , I had this model for a number of years and was very well pleased. It started giving problems about six months ago. I searched in a number stores and internet , this model appeared to be close to what I had so I ordered it. I&#x27;m not sure what  I don&#x27;t like about it. I don&#x27;t care for the floating head, also the blades get extemely warm, I don&#x27;t know why? I will try to get use to it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 5 different electric shavers, and this one is the first to give me a closer shave.  I use a blade usually, and this is one razor that matches as close as I&#x27;ve come to a shave with a blade. One thing that bothers me is that the cutters spin slower than expected, and it will tug a hair occasionally. I guess nothing is sooo perfect. I first used one in the hospital.  Before your shave, put talc powder on to make it shave better, AND eliminate the pull.</li>
    <li> this is my husbands favorite razor.  His old one went  to the hospital with him and when he came home the cord to charge it was gone.  He was due for anew one anyway so he is really pleased with this one.</li>
    <li> It shaves great and was an excellent buy!</li>
    <li> shaves ok but head seems loose and moves back and forth</li>
    <li> it is new like it said  shave of this razor is fair at best  i used to have a brawn recharable and it did much better  job</li>
    <li> very good better results with remington than norelco</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought tons of razers, and this is the best razer I have found so far. It feels well built, has excellent flex capabilities and it lasts a long time on a charge.</li>
    <li> GREAT RAZOR, WILL BUY AGAIN</li>
    <li> It works very well for me. I took it on vacation to Twin Falls,Idaho , and I was very pleased with the performance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a month and have used it almost every day since I got it.  It is a decent razor for the price.  The battery life is good.  I have only had to charge it twice since he initial 24 hour charge.  The reason I give it 3 stars (3.5 if it was possible) is because it just doesn&#x27;t produce as close a shave as I had hoped.  My previous Remington razor was less expensive and shaved closer.  Not a bad item but slightly disappointing.</li>
    <li> My dad complained that his face was caught in the shaver several times and the charge seems weak....replaced this with an expensive norelco which he is happy with now. He had a norelco for years and believes in their brand.</li>
    <li> for the price this is a very nice shaver.  it holds the charge for a long time and easy to manage.</li>
    <li> Works fine, a little larger than my last razor.</li>
    <li> Disappointing. Pulls and drags. Have used Remington for many years and this is my worst one yet. Wish I had just replaced the blades in my old one. If I&#x27;d have known ahead of time  it was this bad, I would have tried Norelco again. Also, who would sell a new razor without giving you a cap to cover and protect the blades? How much could it have cost? 25 cents? Shame on you Remington!</li>
    <li> Have only used one time on friend but works really well. Better than the one he had been using that missed most whiskers.</li>
    <li> I had used an electric razor all my life but with triple straight heads.  I was a little leery about using a rotary razor for the first time.  I was concerned about the 3 rotary heads allowing me to cut a straight line especially at the bottom of sideburns.  After shaving with the rotary system, I found that exact concern is true.  I now have to use a trimmer to make a straight cut.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Had purchased this quick because mine broke. Love the Remingtons. Works great and is very gentle once I shave to stubble. Charges quick and lasts a long time on one charge.</li>
    <li> Very close shave.I have two of them.</li>
    <li> Shaves well but I always have to go over it again</li>
    <li> Overly legit razor. Charge lasts for a couple of days! Usually does pull hair, but leaves a nice smooth shave afterward.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor since June 2014. I paid around $33. The first month it produced a shave that was close to a 5 blade manual shave. After about a month it still gives a good shave but not as close as a 5 blade Gillette can. No one will notice unless they are staring at your face, it still produces an even smooth shave that is pretty close to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 year later I am still using this, I have used it 1 time per day approximately 4-6 times a week. I charge it once a week or once every two weeks. It started to sometimes cause that tug and pull pain when I shave but that is only when I let my hair grow for more than two - three days before I shave. When I first had the razor it did not produce this irritation. As long as I shave regularly no discomfort. I am still using original blade. Charge stays in unit very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The side trimmer has definitely lost its ability to cut. It will cut with several passes but not nearly as well as when it started. Like trying to use safety scissors. I did not use it that much either sometimes on sideburns maybe once or twice a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than those minor complaints I am completely satisfied with this razor. I last used it yesterday morning with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;Even if it fails tomorrow I feel I would have got my money&#x27;s worth out of this unit. It is the best one I have ever owned and has lasted the longest. I have never used a really expensive unit so I have no comparison.&lt;br /&gt;I have used cheaper units and they hurt, they dulled quickly and they could not cut close to skin. They would leave approx 1-2 mm of hair and I would have to use a manual razor if I wanted that removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this razor I have not touched my 5 blade Gillette razor in a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Close shave, good charge, original blades still work (except side trimmer) worth it.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have invested in a shaver like this, and I must say I am not disappointed. This shaver shaves very close I didn&#x27;t know my face could feel that smooth, all in all very good product and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great razor at a great price, super fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> Good shaver and close shaves. Quiet running . Delivers a good shave in short order,much quicker than my old shaver. Wish it came with a case.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a remington before, it lasted over 20 years, motor was still fine, battery was shot. I&#x27;ve owned very expensive shavers and quite frankly, they didn&#x27;t shave very well. This one shaves my face nicely, like my old Renington did. After two months, I&#x27;m getting about 2 1/2 weeks per charge, quality is very good,  very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> It works great and was at a good price.  I recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Not as close a shave as my old Remington. A plus is that it holds its charge as long as advertised.</li>
    <li> It cuts very close and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin. I love how it&#x27;s very easy to clean, just run it over the tap and... your done!. It fully charges in one hour which is great!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my dying Norelco. While it does give a good shave, the heads got very warm to the touch causing me to stop shaving for a few minutes until cooled. I bought a Norelco and still have this as a backup shaver. If your beard is kind of heavy I would consider a different choice. For lighter beards this will be fine.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this for my then fiance, now husband bc he would shave with traditional razors and wouldn&#x27;t shave often out of sheer laziness! I was done dealing with his scattered peach fuzz! He now uses this almost daily and his face is always super smooth! comes with a plug in charger but the battery lasts for a good while. I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
    <li> I could not have asked for better treatment and results.  The shaver came to me sooner than expected and it works very well.  No complaints at  all.</li>
    <li> I can not use this Remington R4-5150A. It is hurting several days at my neck area after I shaved. It is very danger to shave at neck area. I returned it and buy other kind shaver.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.  The blades feel like they will fall off the razor, it doesn&#x27;t shave very close and if you have a mustache or beard you are trimming around, it has a tendency to grab longer hairs and jerk them out.  Needless to say, this isn&#x27;t very comfortable.</li>
    <li> Very happy to find and purchase item used before previously And at an even lower price.</li>
    <li> Very pleased. Works great. Shaves great.Easy to clean.Delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> Basically a good shaver. However does not seem to have the cutting power of its predecessor. It takes a tad longer to shave than the previous model</li>
    <li> I was actually shocked at how well this worked. I have been using it for a month or so, daily, and It is easy to clean and shaves well, with almost no &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34;. So far it has been worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I like the smooth shave but it takes about two weeks to let your skin and facial hair respond to the rotary blades and cutting heads on the shaver.  It re-charges in 90 - 120 minutes and I get approx. 3 -4 days of shave time in-between charging the battery.  It is much quieter than my previous  shaver which was not a rotary style.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best electric shaver I have ever owned &#x3D;&#x3D; and I&#x27;ve owned a lot!  It&#x27;s extremely effective, takes half the time it did with my Norelco rotary, great for two-day and more beards, gentle on the skin, and the price!!  You can&#x27;t beat this one.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my elderly father, who is on blood thinners so he can no longer use a razor. He is OK with it, but not thrilled, as it does not provide a close shave.  I verified that it definitely leaves a slight razor stubble behind.  Some guys may like that, but my father doesn&#x27;t.  Other than that, it holds a charge well, and at least provides a consistent shave.  It also does not pull, tug, or nick skin, which is very important for my father.  All in all, it is not bad for the inexpensive price, but it&#x27;s not great either.</li>
    <li> This shaver was ok for 6 months and 17 days.  Just ok.  I can&#x27;t say that the shave was spectacular, but it worked ok.  I was really hoping for something reliable, that I might be shaving with for several years, perhaps.  That certainly was something I had come to expect of a shaver.  This one, however, died on the 17th day of the sixth month of our relationship.  I guess if you&#x27;re looking for a disposable shaver this might be just the ticket for you.  Personally, I&#x27;m switching brands.</li>
    <li> This is a good shaver for a reasonable price. I like the fuel gauge on it that gives&lt;br /&gt;an instant view of how much charge is left.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the identical razor for about 3 years, but it seemed to be slowing down. The old one never gave me a problem, always did the job, so I bought the same one again. Why mess with success. I do like that you have an indicator telling you how much charge is left.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent razor for the price.  It gets the job done, but sometimes it pulls hair a little bit.</li>
    <li> I have used these razors before...it seems the motor runs about half the speed of the older one I purchased last year?</li>
    <li> good value good shipper</li>
    <li> Perfect. My husband hasnt had any issues with it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first serious electric shaver, I very hopeful waiting, arrived in perfect condition, and exactly the time said. I did not expect the gift of aftershave lotion, an excellent gesture on the part of the company Remington, but hoped razor left buttock skin like me baby, it was not so. But shaves well, almost does, it is not as perfect as a razor, but looks good, feels very slight beard, but the price would buy, but I hope I last a few years, but so do not buy another, is very quiet, and hardly feel the razor, I had to put myself in the mirror to realize that if I had shaved great, I had to cut my beard first, it hurt a little with long beard , quisas po Why is my first time, hehehehe ... If shaved, if so, although a little slow, I think I expected a mower ... All very good, give it a 4 star, wanting to give a 3 star, because honestly expected a close shave as the publication, buttock type of drink, 4 stars because it is very nice and grippy, comfortable, the gift of cream, and if it works well, and does the job, not perfect but very good, I think with more power is achieved an excellent machine.</li>
    <li> The battery seems to die quicker than my old razor. Also, the shave is fine, but it does not plow through as easily like my old Remington. OK razor for the money though.</li>
    <li> This razor works really well and I have been surprised at how long the battery can last when fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my last razor had a NiCad battery and it would only last 2-3 sessions before dying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor I believe has a lithium ion battery and the other week I didn&#x27;t realize I hadn&#x27;t plugged it up until it finally died after about 5 or 6 days of solid use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good shave overall also. Cuts clean and close and I have not had any razor burn with this model so I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> Exceeded my Expectations...</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these for my sons for Christmas - I knew it was a good brand as husband has one: they are even better than I expected, and they came quickly, so I had them in plenty of time.</li>
    <li> Works great so far after a week its holding charge good and cutting my beard</li>
    <li> Like all rechargeable razors I&#x27;ve owned over the years, these work best when connected to 120 VAC.  There is an audible change in power when the razor is plugged in, even when the unit is fully charged.  You&#x27;ll still get 5 or 6 shaves on batteries, but by the end of the fifth shave, you can tell there&#x27;s more tugging and pulling by the slower rotating blades.&lt;br /&gt;The unit opens and breaks down easily;I&#x27;m pleased so see that Remington has adopted the Norelco &#x27;blades mounted in a carrier&#x27; assembly that comes out with a quarter-turn of a central locking retainer instead of the older, spring-held configuration of my old Remington.  A good deal, especially at this price point!!  Great for traveling when you know you&#x27;re going to be away from AC power, as long as it&#x27;s not more than 5-6 times.</li>
    <li> I have owned this exact razor for the last 4 years, it was given to me by my Dad. The model number was different, but it is essentially the same razor. I purchased the RA-5150A based on my previous experience. My old razor finally no longer charged the battery, but still worked when plugged in, which was nice, and it still works now. However, I wanted the convenience of the battery feature again, so for $30 I bought this. Although the build quality is slightly cheaper (what isn&#x27;t these days) the razor works every bit as well as my old model. The razor is quiet and gives a nice close shave. Once every couple of months I take it apart and give it a thorough cleaning. Daily I simply tap the razor stubble into the sink. The razor head can be rinsed under the faucet but I prefer not to, I like dry cleaning with a little brush. The battery holds a good charge, at least 3-4 days worth of shaving. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> nice quite smooth shaver, i would recommend it to anyone, nice to have the charge lights also and cord/cordless feature</li>
    <li> Yep, it shaves well.  I used to have hair on my face, not it&#x27;s... it&#x27;s... GONE!  Can you BELIEVE it?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Remington rotary razors for years and love them.  However, this is the first one I&#x27;ve ever received that has no travel pouch, no cleaning brush for the blades, AND NO COVER TO PROTECT THE BLADES.  Previous plastic covers from other Remington razors I&#x27;ve used don&#x27;t seem to fit, I&#x27;m going on vacation soon and don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;m going to pack this.  I&#x27;ll probably keep this to use at home until the blades wear out, and will then buy another Remington in the future that specifically says it has the travel accessories.</li>
    <li> The lights in the shaver do not work.  The battery gets really hot when I leave it plugged in.  It does not shave as close as other models.....just a so, so shaver.</li>
    <li> My son in his twenties shaves his head, this razor gives a very close, smooth, look and feel. Is a great gift.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these that I have owned. I dropped my other one several times. It still works, but the head is loose. Great buy and a great price.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best shaver in this price range. You just have to decide where to draw the line: for $10-$15 more you get something better, and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t consider the heads to be independently floating. Each one tilts toward the middle, and the base that all three are on tilts in a few directions. This accommodates the curves, etc. of your face, but not perfectly. Also, these heads tilting have sort of a clunky sound and feel. Again, functional, but it just doesn&#x27;t feel like a great razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get about four shaves / charge, and I have a normal beard: thick enough to have to shave daily, but no shadow really noticeable until the next morning. When fully charged, the LEDs stay on 100% for three days (shaves), but then drop to 0% before I&#x27;ve finished shave #4. I&#x27;ve just learned to charge every four days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For travel: There is no travel case or head protector. The power cord is small and lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, I do get a great shave every time I use it, and that&#x27;s what matters.</li>
    <li> When I turned 25 all of my hair took off..... For years after, I just razor blade to shave my head which needless to say was very costly considering the razor prices. It wasn&#x27;t until I visited a friend of mine (also bald), when I noticed he an exceptionally close and smooth shave. I quickly asked him what he used for his head.. enter this bad johnny!! Works great, battery lasts about two weeks, and I get as good of a shave as a razor without the cost. I will tell you it takes a good three weeks for your head to adjust to the razor but after that it&#x27;s nothing but smooth sailing if you shave eveyday. If you wait a day you&#x27;re also good to go, anthing more than that and you&#x27;d have to use a razor. RDE</li>
    <li> This is the bargain version of the other cordless shavers. Overall, it does the job but the pivoting can use a lot of work. It doesn&#x27;t move or feel smooth as it moves around your chin and the blades isn&#x27;t as sharp as the other higher end models. You can feel it tugging on your hairs.</li>
    <li> I got this for my 16 yr old to start shaving. Easy to use. He has no complaints and it is giving him and nice close shave.</li>
    <li> Everything is satisfactory</li>
    <li> A bit klunky but does the job and the price is right. I like the rinse-clean feature rather than the elaborate disassembly and brushing my previous Remington required. I also like the remaining-power display and 5-minute quick recharge for a single shave.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  It shaves really close, the trimmer works well, and the battery lasts me close to a month between charges.</li>
    <li> Just got it today, and very satisfied, only gripe i have is, it&#x27;s been mentioned that it comes with a brush to clean the blades... but it didn&#x27;t come with miine. But it&#x27;s not a big deal, as i know how to cleanse the blades from previous shavers, Instead i got an Aveeno lotion for after shave.  :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of different shavers over the years. This was by far the worst one I&#x27;ve ever had. It does not cut hair at all it just pulls your hair. And it takes 10 times as long to try and shave. I gave it a fair shake for about six months but I&#x27;m tired of facial hair being pulled instead of cut every day. On my way to the store to buy a real shaver now.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping works great for me.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly great and the battery charge last a long time. Very easy to clean too. The manual is not clear on a few things.</li>
    <li> This is the worst electric razor I have ever used. After allowing 24 hours to fully charge the motor barely turns causing the blades to get caught in a two day beard. Do not waist your money. Spend two-three times more and get a shave. This is just an awful waist of money.</li>
    <li> This razor is definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have an old Remington, non-flex heads, non-pivot and it works better.  I bought this because I thought new would be better than old and because my old is more than 25 years old.  However, I was wrong so this one won&#x27;t get use until the old one stops working.</li>
    <li> My dad&#x27;s first electric razor ~ he was very happy with it and it&#x27;s performance!</li>
    <li> A great little unit, shaves close, easy to clean and holds its charge for about two weeks.  I carry on trips without the charger.  Remington did a great job on this inexpensive unti.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Have not had any issues with it. Can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I use this razor every day in my office.  It&#x27;s been 4 months or so since  bought it with not one issue.  Stays charged, shaves very well.</li>
    <li> I get a closer shave that the old one gave.</li>
    <li> My old Remington R-600 wasn&#x27;t really giving me a close shave, so I looked to replace the shaver head. The replacement heads were kinda expensive so I added a few more dollars and bought a new Remington model from a local store.  Unfortunately, it felt like I was having my whiskers pulled out individually.  So I returned it.  Still needing a new razor, I turned to Amazon for a different model. I liked the new features on the R4-5150. What I did not like was the feeling of my whiskers being pulled out. I don&#x27;t know what is happening to Remington, but I can&#x27;t figure why they are allowing these poorly made razors onto the marketplace.  I&#x27;m sending this one back. I ordered then received the SP-27 replacement heads from Amazon today. After installing them in the R-600 I was very happy with the close and smooth cut.  No pulling.  The old trimmer blades may not work like a new razor, but for now, at least I get a comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Razor dose not work as well as I expected may need to use a little longer &amp; let battery die and be recharged</li>
    <li> Very happy with my new razor the battery indicator doesn&#x27;t work right but still I really like it.</li>
    <li> for the money, this is a great razor. it would be great for just about any price. I shave my head as well as my beard and it does a good smooth job. It does not feel particularly solid but it works great.</li>
    <li> Worst electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s been sitting in a cupboard after the first month of trying to use it,</li>
    <li> The razor gives you a close shave and you don&#x27;t have to charge it that often. This is a good razor.</li>
    <li> A close comfortable shave with a good price to match</li>
    <li> Crapped out within 6 months</li>
    <li> Had to return this as it was not exactly what my husband wanted</li>
    <li> Prior to buying this razor, I had very little experience with electric razors. For my purposes, this razor does a good job of providing a close shave and leaving your face with a clean feel. I did not rate the razor at the &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; level because it is not particularly effective in trimming sideburns and mustaches. Overall, however, it is good value for the money.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my husband and he said it gives him a clean shave, and it&#x27;s light weight.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Shipped quick, works well, thanks!!</li>
    <li> I like a lot of the features of this shaver but it has a tendency to pull hairs, especially if one doesn&#x27;t shave every day.  Remington offers a 30 day satisfaction guarantee or a refund of the purchase price.  I am thinking of exercizing that option but hate bothering with returns by mail.  It would probably be good for a daily shaver.</li>
    <li> does the work but...&lt;br /&gt;it is noisy,&lt;br /&gt;the battery  needs to be charged after 15 to 20 minutes of use.</li>
    <li> It cuts close, the blades last long, it works with the cord even when the battery is dead. I bought a second one for my car. Only glitch is that when the five green lights go out and the red one is left, the red lasts longer than the five green lights together so that the red light hardly serves its purpose. But not a big problem.</li>
    <li> I am Very pleased with this shaved ! Holds a Good charge and Shaves perfectly .</li>
    <li> My sons likes it quite a bit</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver for the price.</li>
    <li> 5 stars because it deserves it,I have had a Remington shaver all my life,I am 63, this is a very good shaver and I would recommend it to any one who cares!&lt;br /&gt;Very quiet,easy to clean the head area of the shaver!!</li>
    <li> This was a great deal on a very nice Remington shaver. It was a gift and he absolutely loves it. It does shave very close and no nicks.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves it. He was looking for an electric shaver that would give him a closer shave since the one he already had was old. This one is great.</li>
    <li> This razor is the best one I have ever owned. I have tried about four different other ones, but none of them even compared to this one. The battery lasts for a long time on a charge. The clipping collecter is very easy to clean, and the pivot feature actually works.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light weight and easy to recharge. However, it does not come with a travelling case. It is easy to use, and clean after useage.</li>
    <li> Works like ones from the store.</li>
    <li> Very strong and easy to use...close shave bottom line....</li>
    <li> Had this for over a year now and haven&#x27;t needed to replace the blades yet. It gives you a pretty good shave for the price, however doesn&#x27;t go over too well with semi longer hair. I didn&#x27;t shave for 3 days which gives me a little longer 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, tried using the shaver and it took some time with lots of pulling... the little shaver that flips out on the back side isn&#x27;t that great when trying to clean up the sideburns.</li>
    <li> I read reviews that indicated that if you are the type who tends to let his beard go for a couple of days between shaves, than the rotary style is better than the foil.  That tends to be my MO and this particular razor does the job at a fraction of the price.  No razor burn and good enough results for daily activities if not formal events.  I also like the ability to use it corded or cordless since I usually shave at the sink and cordless doesn&#x27;t offer any real advantage and will eventually lead to having to replace your battery which can cost as much as the razor itself.</li>
    <li> very good electric razor, I bought it to replace a terrible Phillips Norelco and after getting this one for a notably lower price I was able to get a very close shave in no more than a couple minutes, no skin irritation, good battery life. I don&#x27;t give it maximum rating because the overall building looks cheap and the head tilts too much and feels like it was about to dislodge and fall apart. But I grant the performance fully satisfies me.</li>
    <li> I replaced a Norelco shaver which took a long time to get a reasonably close shave.  My initial opinion of this shaver is great!  Shaves closer and quickly.  The noise is not much louder than my old Norelco.  So far very pleased.</li>
    <li> Good razor. Not as close a shave as I was hoping, but I do like the pivoting head. Time will tell on how the razor holds up. Charge lasts twice as long as the older Remington models which is a big plus!</li>
    <li> It works very well,but I wish the charge time would last longer than 6 days...&lt;br /&gt;Mark</li>
    <li> It needed a new blade as soon as it started using it.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased.  Not because the first one broke, but because my wife stole the first one and uses it for her leggs.  *sigh*  Its a good little razor and it gets the job done.  Shaving is not as close as a blade, but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my excessively sensitive face and neck.  I may never go back to my Mach-3 blades!</li>
    <li> Best electric razor that I have ever owned, bar none, and that includes even other Remingtons for a lot more money. Titanium coated cutters provide durability.</li>
    <li> I use this shaver in my barber shop regularly. It is easy to clean and sanitize and I haven&#x27;t had any problem with its performance. the drier the skin surface the better it works.</li>
    <li> I have had a lot of electric shavers over the years, and this is the worst. It pulls at my beard, making for a very uncomfortable shave. It actually HURTS!! Terrible</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t grow a thick beard, but this razor left me stinging every single time after having used it for four straight weeks.  For me, it&#x27;s good in a pinch, but I have since stopped using it and wil shave with it only when I have nothing else.</li>
    <li> This item met all my expectations! Amazone and Remington have been there for me whenever I rquired something Now!&lt;br /&gt;My face is clean Shaven!</li>
    <li> I typically use a straight edged razor, but there are days when I don&#x27;t have much time. That&#x27;s when I use this electric razor. It does the job well and easily. It&#x27;s almost as smooth as when I use my regular razor.</li>
    <li> it could have been better quality but the price was right.  husband has a beard so not used on the whole face.</li>
    <li> it is very easy to use and does a good job ,my grandson is a little slow to learn but has had great time using this new razor.</li>
    <li> Does a great job shaving, and has a percentage-light indicating how much power is left in the shaver&#x27;s rechargeable battery.</li>
    <li> Bought this on product reputation, history with brand, price and having such a good experiences with Amazon recently (kudos, guys!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time anything ever came with a problem. One of the foils (the round part of the cutters on top) had a virtually microscopic dent in it which didn&#x27;t allow the blades underneath to spin. I really don&#x27;t think this was a problem that occured anywhere else but on the assembly line before packing. So, not actually anything that Amazon did or could prevent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, to Amazons credit, they issued a &#x27;return ticket&#x27; immediately and we are presently in the process of resolving this matter. Thanks again for the wonderful customer service!</li>
    <li> The R4-5150A Remington Razor gives a good shave once broken in. The razor lasts more than a year before blade changing and the power of the razor lasts more than 3 years when plugged into a wall outlet. It suits me just fine. I like it over all the other razors.</li>
    <li> The blades on this electric shaver move so slow that I can&#x27;t possibly get a close shave. The older model Remington shaver that I still have was twice as fast. I guess I&#x27;ll try Norelco next time.</li>
    <li> I think the only reason there are good reviews in here is because we&#x27;ve lost our ability over the years to separate quality from trash. Now granted, it does seem to shave close, but I could be wrong since I&#x27;ve used the same Norelco for the last 10 years, and it wasn&#x27;t exactly sharp anymore. It quit working even plugged in so I was forced to buy another shaver. Norelco for some reason thinks their shavers don&#x27;t need flip up trimmers any more, which is really bad for me because I&#x27;m stuck with cheap trash. First thing I noticed was how much it felt cheap, plastic and light compared to my now dead Norelco. Upon using it I noticed how much weaker the motor was in comparison too, as the blades snag on hairs every so often and you can hear the revolutions slow a bit. It&#x27;s even worse when not plugged in because there isn&#x27;t &#x27;as much&#x27; power available when on battery only. Getting tired of Chinese garbage. Bought a manual edge trimmer recently from depot that collapsed/bent under my 155 lb weight. Are you kidding me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Might have the wrong model. Mine might have been the R5150, but like that could make a difference. It&#x27;s actually more expensive&lt;br /&gt;2nd Edit: Norelco&#x27;s do have pop up trimmers. Not sure why I was having a hard time finding one at the stores. Woot, now I can take it back&lt;br /&gt;3rd Edit: Got my Norelco. 7130 I think. Also made in China of course, and also feels a bit more cheap than my old one, but still a bit better than the remington, but then again it was $20 more. I&#x27;ll stay with it. Getting away from garbage is near impossible these days anyway.</li>
    <li> Brought this to replace a old razor that that I had been replacing the blades on every six months, first thing I noticed is how close my shave is now and how light weight this remington is.</li>
    <li> Better than the more expensive ones.</li>
    <li> Husband very happy with this gift.  Says &#x27;it gets the job done!&#x27;</li>
    <li> GREAT BUY 1/2 COST OF NORELCO , SHAVE AS WELL AS A RAZOR</li>
    <li> Gave to my father and he loves it - and he hates to shave!</li>
    <li> This razor give a good shave at a low price. I would highly recommend it. Plus remington is a great name</li>
    <li> this is actually my 2nd one of these - we bought the first one locally and my son scarfed it for himself when we took off for college.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually prefer a cheap bic razor in the shower...but there are times when this comes in really handy.  Holds a charge for a LONG time and actually cuts super close.  Oh yeah...it was cheaper here on Amazon and Prime at that!</li>
    <li> Not great, but for a cheap electric shaver it does a very good job.  Lightweight, charges quickly and holds a charge for a long time, and does a decent cutting job. I do use a blade primarily, so for me an electric is filler for the days I need a break or don&#x27;t have time. I literally shaved with this while driving (not in traffic, thank you!) and it was easy to use and did a decent job. Good product for the money, but if you want a really great shave, look elsewhere (or use a good blade!)</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s inexpensive then there&#x27;s Cheap. I didn&#x27;t shave close and blades seemed dull from the start. The battery couldn&#x27;t hold a charge, so I had to shave with it plugged in. Ended up going back to a Norelco.</li>
    <li> works well, easy to clean,  shaves close,  like feature that can be portable or plug in.  overall no complaints.  quiet also.</li>
    <li> GREAT ITEM - EASY TO TAKE TRAVELLING.</li>
    <li> The best value out there for electric razors.  This model does just fine for my regular scruff.  I shave with it every day and now after a year it is still as  good as new.  The charge indicator is great and the unit recharges in about an hour!  I had the older version of this and was reluctant to try another new model.  I am just as happy with this one.  I read all the reviews and looked at all the choices.  This is the one you want.</li>
    <li> I have always been much more satisfied with the quality of the shave from a Remington shavers versus Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit however only lasted about eight months before it just stopped working altogether one day mid shave?!?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, for the price, I bought another!  I hope the first one&#x27;s failure was a fluke!</li>
    <li> This is good gift to buy for a male member of the family. I bought this for my younger bother because the last one he had was a piece of crap it had to stay on it charger in orderings to be use. But this one is a whole lot better.</li>
    <li> This razor may not be the top quality of $100 razors, but it is solid and functions perfectly.  The head pivot is a little rattly when following face contours, but the cut is very close and even. The head mechanism is easy to take apart for cleaning.  The battery life is very good and the LED battery life indicators are very convenient. For the money, you can&#x27;t beat it. (P.S. My previous NEW Panasonic inline razor was terrible, leaving hairs that it never again could cut.  That&#x27;s why I tried this unit.)</li>
    <li> The shave is good but it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long sometimes have to plug in to finish the shave.</li>
    <li> Good razor for the money. Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Great price... Excellent value!</li>
    <li> Works very well as long as you use it at least every other day.  If your beard is too long, the blades pull at your skin.</li>
    <li> Just got this in today and I&#x27;m impressed!! Hubby used it with the FaceSaver stick and we were both pleasantly surprised at how smooth his face was! It barely left any stubble at all!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He said it did pull a few hairs though, but I guess when you&#x27;re dealing with anything mechanical vs hair, you&#x27;re gonna get that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I don&#x27;t like, it shows the head detached for rinsing. We can flip the head up, but can&#x27;t figure out how it comes off. It actually doesn&#x27;t appear to at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, definitely worth the money if you can&#x27;t afford the expensive ones and it beats razor burn or nicks from a regular manual razor!</li>
    <li> My husband was thrilled to find that his favorite razor could still be purchased with Titanium blades!</li>
    <li> Cuts pretty close, daily scalp groomer, not bad at all and quicker/easier than blading every day. Recommend to Amy and all!</li>
    <li> They have improved these things over the years.  Battery life is excellent and it shaves well too. Has a handy battery level indicator built in.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed in the quality of this Reminton product although, I didn&#x27;t expect the best since this was a pretty inexpensive razor. The razor was not very powerful and the battery drained down quicker than desired.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor and, so far, is only recharging it once a week and is using it daily.</li>
    <li> great shave,easy and fast. price very good . you don&#x27;t  need a high priced shaver to get the job done. this will do fine. I would  suggest this razor for everybody.</li>
    <li> Yes yes yes great product totally satisfied. Great seller</li>
    <li> box looked like it went thru the mill, product works fine</li>
    <li> This is an amazing razor. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this razor he got for his birthday! It is a great value for the money! Money well spent.</li>
    <li> I liked my old Remington a bit better than this new one, but I will give it time to wear in. This razor seems to tug and pull on hairs a bit more frequently than my old Remington did, but it&#x27;s still not enough to annoy me. Washing the blades is easy and the head of the razor makes shaving against the grain comfortable and easy. As others have mentioned, the tugging/pulling problem seems to be a bit more frequent if you go 2-3 days between shaves. All in all, it&#x27;s a great electric shaver if you shave every day. If not, the tugging and pulling may start to annoy you.</li>
    <li> Crapped out in less than a year.....trimmer was engaged, but wouldn&#x27;t trim. Tried cleaning and even blowing it out from the air compressor at work thinking something must be trapped in between the blades, but no luck, bought another shaver. It DID do a nice job when it worked, although battery could be a bit stronger</li>
    <li> Not as good as my old one.</li>
    <li> The shaver part of this is actually really good. The issue I have is with the trimmer, it just doesn&#x27;t want to cut anything. I&#x27;ve had this issue every since I got it too.  It looks like I&#x27;m combing my facial hair more than cutting. Its frustrating beyond imagine trying to cut a couple weeks worth of growth. Do not buy if the trimmer is just as important to you as the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life isn&#x27;t that great either, half hour to 45 mins of use per charge.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t charge while shaving - it has to be off the charge.  Otherwise, it works fine.</li>
    <li> This is the best shave I ever had with a Electric shaver. This dose not hurt your face and leaves it very smooth.</li>
    <li> Im a Remington shaver fan, but I never could get this to work real well for me. Now I do like to let my beard grow out for a few days and then trim it and shave, so that may be it, but this shaver was always splotchy at best for me. I like that it has the ability to plug in the wall and be used or be charged and used.</li>
    <li> The shaver works well, is quiet, fast and does not pull at my whiskers.  I find that the shaving head flops around supposedly to follow face contours.  I do not like this feature and prefer a fixed shaving head.  Otherwise it would get 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver in 2013, and have used it off and on because it does not give a very close shave. I have had to go over the surface of my skin several times to get all the hairs. I also own a corded/non-battery Remington, and it gives a much closer shave. I have owned the corded shaver for over 3 years and actually prefer it to this battery one.</li>
    <li> My dad and uncle own a barbershop and they use these to finish off the neckline. We have purchased 10 in the last 2 weeks so that should tell you something. After the first one was used, every barber in the shop just had to have one and even a few long time customers asked him to get them one for home they liked it so well.</li>
    <li> It is a good razor for the price. I get a good clean shave with it. II would recommend it. I is better than some of the more expensive ones I have had.</li>
    <li> close comfortable shave, quiet operation, I just purchased the F 5800 I like this one better because it shaves closer while being quiet, I recommend.</li>
    <li> Great razor....would refer it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I had a R-950 Remington for years, batteries finally got weak.  After weeks of deciding I went with this.  Won&#x27;t look back.  Should have done long ago.  Can&#x27;t believe there might be a razor better than this?  Excellent razor.  On my 4th shave and batteries still strong and motor is quiet and does a very good job.</li>
    <li> Super smooth and super quiet. So far it&#x27;s my best Remington ever, and I&#x27;ve had at least eight.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy it again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> Great razor for the price!</li>
    <li> I ordered this Remington R4-5150A Titanium Rotatry with Pivot and Flex Technology. Because I kept cutting myself with the old type razor. So for I have not cut myself with this and it gives me a perfect close shave.</li>
    <li> Weaker than expected, does not hold a good charge. I&#x27;ve had many electric shavers, so I have a good and long basis of comparison. It&#x27; a Remington, yet it feels like a knock-off - as far as performance.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it is a knock-off...</li>
    <li> I have used this brand of shaver before.  It does not cut close enough. Have to repeat over and over.</li>
    <li> Great razor, first rotary shaver I tried. Nice close shave and a lot more quiet then my previous razor.</li>
    <li> The pivot is sloppy, but seems to do the job.  The razor has to be plugged in every week, but doesn&#x27;t take long to re-charge.</li>
    <li> great value, my old replacement blades work for it too!</li>
    <li> Great item for the price. A bargain compared to Norelco razors. This did replace an upper model Remington razor that was better and almost as cheap at the time. This one has much less battery life and will not function from A/C current alone like my old Remington. In other words, if my other Remington razor was completely dead, you could still plug it in and use it immediately. This model cannot run off of ac power alone as  you will have to wait for it to build up a charge before use.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    UPDATE:  I cannot say more positive things about Remmington. I really feel my review was fair and I was certainly not trying to bash Remmington in any way. In fact, like I stated, they are a bargain compared to Norelco razors. The company makes high quality razors at great prices.    So, apparently, Remmington read my review and reached out to me. After thoroughly discussing how this razor was performing, they believed that the one I received had a defect. They sent me a brand new one at no cost. This one works perfectly. LISTEN, no company has ever stepped up to the plate like Remmington did. Talk about standing behind your products. I did not EVER contact Remmington. They contacted me    My suggestion to ANYONE looking to buy an electric razor is to seriously check out the Remmington line first. They make high quality products at much better prices than Norelco... In my opinion and experience. I wish I could now change my review to 5 stars because it&#x27;s worth that rating!</li>
    <li> Purchased several for me and my friends, so far so good, and the price is cheaper than the local grocery stores.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product and Service</li>
    <li> I like it :a lot&#x27; smooth shave, cheap price and good feel. this shaver is the best I have owned over 50 years. I have owned a lot of norelcos that didn&#x27;t do as well.</li>
    <li> Before I bought this razor I read the reviews and overall it had a fairly high rating.  It has the led indicator to indicate how much of a charge is left which I really like and my old shaver didn&#x27;t have.  Considering everything, I thought for the price what can I lose?  I was using a Braun that I was really happy with but the battery wasn&#x27;t holding much of a charge.  Previous to the Braun I had always used a Norelco so I thought I would give the Remington rotary shaver a try.  I expected some initial irritation but after more than a month it shouldn&#x27;t still be continuing.  The reason is having to continually go over the same places several times to get all of the hair.  The performance is nothing as described, pretty much a big disappointment when it comes to getting a clean shave.  On the upside, I can get 2 days worth of shaving on 1 charge which would probably be more if I didn&#x27;t have to spend 15 minutes each time!  If you have sensitive skin I would really think twice before buying this shaver.  You&#x27;ll end up with razor burn like you won&#x27;t believe and probably remove a little skin as well as hair!</li>
