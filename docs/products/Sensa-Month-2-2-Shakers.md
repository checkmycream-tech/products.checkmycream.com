      <li>For me that&#x27;s amazing!  </li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not good business at all.</li>
      <li>This is not a miracle cure, but it was a good aid in reducing my appetite.  </li>
      <li>IN my opinion this product was hyped up to look good.</li>

      <li>and i still have to use my own</li>
      <li>I have been using this for 2 months now and it does work as advertised very easy to use I</li>
      <li>this stuff works great if you use it right.</li>
      <li>, I figured I can lose weight on my own better :)</li>
      <li>It would be more effective if you went to the Magic Kingdom at Disney World and bought some Fairy Dust to sprinkle on your food.&lt;br</li>

      <li>Will continue a while longer to see if there is any more reduction in weight.</li>
      <li>glad i bought it here intead of getting it where it cost more.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It may cost more on SNBC, but you best believe it will be a fresh batch, and it will be the real thing.</li>
      <li>We thought we followed instructions, but after more than three months, we did not notice any weight loss at all.  </li>
      <li>then sure.  </li>
      <li>One more month to go.</li>
      <li>I found that I could still eat more if I wanted to, but I didn&#x27;t need to.  </li>
      <li>I will try one more month and that&#x27;s it.  </li>
      <li>I PERSONALLY USE IT AND HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL.</li>
      <li>To be fair, I have not been as consistent as I should have been.</li>
      <li>So far seems to be working great.</li>
      <li>Your suppose to smell it in your food and the scent is suppose to communicate with your brain to trick you into getting full faster!??</li>
      <li>it was in good shape and brand new .</li>
      <li>No side effects, just nice steady wt loss-even  </li>
      <li>Both month supply came in an original box from  Sensa exept Month 2</li>
      <li>and I feel full even with a light snack.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
      <li>The product seems to help me feel full, however; I lost 3 pounds in month two.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The good news is I have lost four pounds without doing anything differently.</li>
      <li>tea works better than this stuff or the new version of Phen-phen.</li>
      <li>it is worth trying it and see what happens....</li>
      <li>I fell into the lose weight quick gimic of this product, I tried the first month lost 5 pounds that month</li>
      <li>The people who made this drug i would say had to be already rich and well off on the count of how much they must have put into publicity and advertising because this stuff was all over the news, the internet etc..</li>
      <li>Yeah right.</li>
      <li>I exercise daily along with selective healthy food eating.</li>
      <li>i did exactly what they told me.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
      <li>I lost some weight, I ate better and was exersizing and didnt lose any weight the second month</li>
      <li>My first month I weighed 426 and in a wheel chair I cannot exercise.</li>
      <li>I dropped 4 lbs in the first couple of weeks</li>
      <li>Will continue for several more months.</li>
      <li>On her diet you can also eat meals with whole grains like true whole wheat bread and pasta and brown rice, but these meal can have NO fat or protein</li>
      <li>After no sucess with loss from the first month(I don&#x27;t think I puy enough of the shaker on the foods), I decided to continue with month # 2 and made sure to put ample ammount on my foods.  </li>
      <li>I should have bought all six months as a set and then followed directions exactly.</li>
      <li>get the starter kit and the second month together for a better price.</li>
      <li>I am now into first week of month 3.  </li>
      <li>shortly It works easily.</li>
      <li>but yes, but you do have to remeber to use it every single time you eat:)</li>
      <li>I need to loose 200 more.</li>
      <li>There has definitely been a huge decrease in my appetite.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work for me</li>
      <li>Also with Sensa you don&#x27;t have to use much of this stuff.</li>
      <li>When I remember to use it, it works very well.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t do much research on the ingredients on that month.  </li>
      <li>Works, but you have to remember to sprinkle it on everything, absolutely everything.</li>
      <li>I could not believe how fast it came .  </li>
      <li>Yes I know that month two has a less powerful scent, than the rest of the months, but the scent of the product was non distinct(non-unusual), as it is with the genuine Sensa.</li>
      <li>This product does nothing it doesn&#x27;t help you to eat any less or more for that matter.</li>
      <li>would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to lose weight</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t know how soon I should see any results, but so far have not seen any.</li>
      <li>I noticed right away that the shakers I received from the vendor D-D&#x27;s CR were different in EVERY way than the ones I previosly purchased @ SNBC.</li>
      <li>I spent many $$$ for this product thinking maybe it would work after several months.</li>
      <li>When food comes along at unscheduled times, i have to make myself aware of the difference between actually being hungry  or just experiencing desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I tried it one time and had an allergic reaction - they first refused to give me any money back.  </li>
      <li>I wrote them again and got the exact same results.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes I eat fruit, (except bananas which are too sweet), too, but it has to be eaten on an empty stomach.</li>
      <li>The smells of genuine Sensa are so odd that you would recognize an immitation.</li>
      <li>Then you will absolutely experience results, when following the program.</li>
      <li>I used more of this sensa on my food, wondering where is the odd smell; but still not really smelling anything.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have result with the first one so money not well spent</li>
      <li>I tried the sensa 1 mixed results since any given week I normally weigh +/-</li>
      <li>in the middle of month 3 and have purchased through month 4, so I’ll use that much up, but I have not lost an ounce and have actually gained weight.  </li>
      <li>if you really want to loose weight</li>
      <li>Stop eating when full, even when not satisfied.</li>
      <li>After the first month and a half, I wrote their customer service and all they did was repeat the instructions that came with the package.  </li>
      <li>The first month I did see a couple pounds missing on my weigh ins.  </li>

<li> So, you can eat all the fat and proteins that you want (as long as you don&#x27;t eat starchy or sugary food), and lose weight.    </li>
<li> I went through the entire series, spent alot of money and lost NO weight.</li>
<li> It is hard to remember to use it particularly when you are away from home.</li>
<li> But even though I used it only a few days, I have to admit that it could possibly work.  </li>
<li> 2 months later, no success.</li>
<li> I was amazed how it help me loose weight.</li>
<li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD -EARNED</li>
<li> I have only used Sensa for a few days.  </li>
<li> Sensa has absolutely no effect</li>
<li> Sensa just absolutely do not work.</li>
<li> I think I got other problem that will not let me lose the weight.</li>
<li> give me $5 back which is nothing compared to what I spent and what it cost to return the 2 month supply - Horrible and would NOT recommend it to ANYONE!Not worth 1 star!!!  </li>
<li> You will be spending about the same amount of money that you would on this sensa but with those products at least you get results and not get played like a fool.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> SENSA IS AN AWESOME PRODUCT. I PERSONALLY USE IT AND HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL. TRY IT YOURSELF BEFORE YOU MAKE A JUDGEMENT. YOOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED IF YOU FOLLOW AS DIRECTED</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping and great packing! Good product. Works, but you have to remember to sprinkle it on everything, absolutely everything.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t believe that sensa worked but to my surprise I lost 5 pounds in a month and my appetite decreased.</li>
    <li> I do amazingly feel fuller and stop eatting sooner , kinda shocking but yes, but you do have to remeber to use it every single time you eat:)</li>
    <li> Sensa Month 2 worked for me, but it did take more effort than Month 1.  My appetite did decrease.  This is not a miracle cure, but it was a good aid in reducing my appetite.  I did use the entire Month 2 container.  Once Month 2 was over, it was easier on Month 3.  I guess I am one of the luckier people.  Sensa has worked for me.  I have lost 30 pounds in 4 months (with moderate exercise, too.)  There has definitely been a huge decrease in my appetite.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost through the second month of using Sensa and I believe it works.  I use a wheelchair and can&#x27;t stand to get weighed but I think I&#x27;m loosing weight.</li>
    <li> Sensa just absolutely do not work. They are selling lies and tall tales. Sensa has absolutely no effect and it&#x27;s all sensory to trick in to believing that your experiencing something. I got it to try for a month free(1 month supply they said) but then they sent me a 6 month supply and tried to charge me for it. These people just want your credit card info to have a field day on it. The people who made this drug i would say had to be already rich and well off on the count of how much they must have put into publicity and advertising because this stuff was all over the news, the internet etc.. and it&#x27;s just a BIG BIG scam to get a hold of your credit card and money. This product does nothing it doesn&#x27;t help you to eat any less or more for that matter. Your suppose to smell it in your food and the scent is suppose to communicate with your brain to trick you into getting full faster!?? Yeah right. I smelled nothing in my food and if i did it didn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money. if you really want to loose weight Tadin Zendo Dieters tea works better than this stuff or the new version of Phen-phen. You will be spending about the same amount of money that you would on this sensa but with those products at least you get results and not get played like a fool.</li>
    <li> this stuff works great if you use it right. you have to kinda watch what you eat and don&#x27;t over used it</li>
    <li> waste of money...glad i bought it here intead of getting it where it cost more. Didn&#x27;t do anything for me at all.</li>
    <li> I went through the entire series, spent alot of money and lost NO weight. It might work for some people but not for me. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have only used Sensa for a few days.  I stopped taking it because I became constipated and that never happens to me.  But even though I used it only a few days, I have to admit that it could possibly work.  I ate only one plate of spaghetti!  For me that&#x27;s amazing!  I found that I could still eat more if I wanted to, but I didn&#x27;t need to.  The other thing that I noticed is that I wasn&#x27;t hungry for hours!  That is definitely like me.      I am going back to my no-carb diet.  I eat meat,cheese, eggs and non-starchy vegetables.  Sometimes I eat fruit, (except bananas which are too sweet), too, but it has to be eaten on an empty stomach. That means that you must wait two hours after a meal to eat fruit, or 1 hour after eating fruit before having a meal.      The premise of this diet is that if you eat starchy or sugary foods your body secretes insulin into your bloodstream.  No insulin is released into the blood from proteins, fats, and non-starchy vegetables. Only when insulin is in your blood can food be stored as fat.  So, you can eat all the fat and proteins that you want (as long as you don&#x27;t eat starchy or sugary food), and lose weight.    I have based this on the Suzanne Somers diet.  On her diet you can also eat meals with whole grains like true whole wheat bread and pasta and brown rice, but these meal can have NO fat or protein, otherwise your body will store any extra as fat.  These meals must be eaten 3 hours either before or after a protein/fat meal.      I just prefer to eat meat, eggs, cheese, and vegetables so that I can eat all day and I don&#x27;t have to wait 3 hours before eating another meal.  You can eat fish, too, but I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because it helped me to lose a lot of weight.  I&#x27;m on my second time around.  I especially like the little&lt;br /&gt;to go packets.  I would definitely recommend it to family &amp; friends.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t change the flavor of the food it was sprinkled on, but it didn&#x27;t curb my appetite or help me lose any weight.  It seems like a great idea, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> this product, is wonderfull , for lost weight, I tell you buy is excellent muy body is differnt, and my weight actually is very low . I to recommend buy!!!.</li>
    <li> i have lost weight on it but can be expensive if you use it long term.....it does NOT curb my appetite and i still have to use my own will power to do that,,,,you must use it on everything you eat and you can NOT forget to do that.....it is worth trying it and see what happens....</li>
    <li> Just weighed myself. 7 weeks on system and I&#x27;ve lost 9 lbs. will order Sensa 3 shortly It works easily.</li>
    <li> This product is horrible!!!!  I tried it one time and had an allergic reaction - they first refused to give me any money back.  give me $5 back which is nothing compared to what I spent and what it cost to return the 2 month supply - Horrible and would NOT recommend it to ANYONE!Not worth 1 star!!!  Terrible customer service!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;unsatisfied customer</li>
    <li> I bought it and didn&#x27;t use the#2series I didn&#x27;t have result with the first one so money not well spent</li>
    <li> It seemed to dull my appetite a bit, but it&#x27;s very expensive to keep using.  I did not use it beyond the 2 shakers and did not see any weight loss.</li>
    <li> There are people who have said they lost pounds.  i did exactly what they told me.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Push away from the table.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 2 months now and it does work as advertised very easy to use I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to lose weight</li>
    <li> Product didn&#x27;t do as promised. Appetite was not lessened and no weight loss occurred. I spent many $$$ for this product thinking maybe it would work after several months. Did nothing. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> It does not seem to be working. I am currently using the step 5 in the hope that something will happen. IN my opinion this product was hyped up to look good.</li>
    <li> Great for traveling. Lost 5 lbs and still ate well.&lt;br /&gt;Like the energy drink as well. Will continue for several more months.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t know how soon I should see any results, but so far have not seen any. It is hard to remember to use it particularly when you are away from home.I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s not going to be a short cut to calories in-calories out.</li>
    <li> It would be more effective if you went to the Magic Kingdom at Disney World and bought some Fairy Dust to sprinkle on your food.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in the middle of month 3 and have purchased through month 4, so I’ll use that much up, but I have not lost an ounce and have actually gained weight.  I followed their directions to the letter.  Never felt any loss of appetite at all.  After the first month and a half, I wrote their customer service and all they did was repeat the instructions that came with the package.  I wrote them again and got the exact same results.  There is no support and no results.&lt;br /&gt;I shake this stuff on everything I eat.  I haven’t changed any of my lifestyle as they suggest and it hasn’t done a thing.  Save your money and join Weight Watchers On Line; it cost less and works better.&lt;br /&gt;This is nothing but a long term expensive scam….</li>
    <li> I started the Sensa diet, being optamistic because I had someone tell me that they had lost 20lbs in 1.5 months. After no sucess with loss from the first month(I don&#x27;t think I puy enough of the shaker on the foods), I decided to continue with month # 2 and made sure to put ample ammount on my foods.  2 months later, no success. I actually gained 5lbs and I discontinued the drops. The person I had gotten the information from was a good sorce of information, just wish it could have worked for me the way it had worked for them.</li>
    <li> I have not lost a pound after using Sensa Month 1 and 2.  I just ordered Month 3 and 4.  I will try one more month and that&#x27;s it.  This is not cheap!</li>
    <li> The product seems to help me feel full, however; I lost 3 pounds in month two.&lt;br /&gt;I lost about 5 pounds in month 1. For just adding this product to my food, the&lt;br /&gt;result are satisfactory.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on month 5 and have lost a total of four pounds. To be fair, I have not been as consistent as I should have been. I should have bought all six months as a set and then followed directions exactly. The good news is I have lost four pounds without doing anything differently. One more month to go.</li>
    <li> I  purchase Sensa  while on vacation .  it was at home waiting for me.  I could not believe how fast it came .  it was in good shape and brand new .</li>
    <li> Sensa is working for me, i have lost  pounds and inches.</li>
    <li> Looks like it is working.&lt;br /&gt;I missed the Sensa Chews from the shippment. I got that with Month 1 and Month 3 too. I don&#x27;t know why was it not included in the package I received. Both month supply came in an original box from  Sensa exept Month 2 (what came from Amazon)&lt;br /&gt;Lets hope it&#x27;ll work.</li>
    <li> I like the commercials on Sensa, so I have tried it.  I am in the second month and plan to use it for the recommended 6 months.  I cannot tell I have lost weight because of using it as I am also on Weight Watchers 360 degree plan.  I figured it could not hurt.  I appreciate the efficient handling of my order by Amazon, you rock!</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot and see what it can do. It&#x27;s worthless. Do not spend your money.</li>
    <li> I dropped 4 lbs in the first couple of weeks I used Sensa.  I stayed on it through month 2 and haven&#x27;t lost an ounce.  As of a few days ago, I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> The first month I did see a couple pounds missing on my weigh ins.  I didn&#x27;t do much research on the ingredients on that month.  This month I found the ingredient \\&quot;Maltodextrin\\&quot; in the list.  It is a known excitotoxin.  If you don&#x27;t care about that then sure.  If you do you should check out this link to see if you want continue with this product.  [...]&lt;br /&gt;or&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;Links were removed, but you can google \\&quot;Maltodextrin Excitoxicin\\&quot; and found what I am talking about.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still trying, i&#x27;m persistent. Hold my apitite a little but i didn&#x27;t luse waight yet and i hope this work &#x27;s.</li>
    <li> We thought we followed instructions, but after more than three months, we did not notice any weight loss at all.  Dom</li>
    <li> Did not meet my expectations, lost no weight at all. You can eat the food you want but will not lose weight.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for approx. 3 months, have seen some weight reduction but was expecting more.  I exercise daily along with selective healthy food eating. I eat somewhere between 800 to 1200 calories each day.  Will continue a while longer to see if there is any more reduction in weight.</li>
    <li> My first month I weighed 426 and in a wheel chair I cannot exercise. In 3 weeks I weighed 411. I need to loose 200 more. Hopefully by 2/7/2014.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, doesn&#x27;t work.  Tried for 2 months, doesn&#x27;t work.  That&#x27;s all I have to say about this product.</li>
    <li> I could not have believed this until I tried this. I was amazed how it help me loose weight. Keep it up.</li>
    <li> Sensa produce did not work well for me I tried twice and I was gain weight. I would not purchase again....</li>
    <li> You need to remember to use it every meal every time. I&#x27;m not disciplined so it didn&#x27;t work. note: I tried the sensa 1 mixed results since any given week I normally weigh +/- 3 lbs.  I wanted to try sensa 2 since #1 spilled out in my purse, forgot to close it.</li>
    <li> have lost 14 pounds in almost 7  weeks.  No side effects, just nice steady wt loss-even  though there are a few times I haven&#x27;t used it because I forgot it at home.</li>
    <li> No change in pounds, tho&#x27; \\&quot;shaked\\&quot; on food as directed. Would not purchase again. Could not recommend as did not wrk.</li>
    <li> Great buy....get the starter kit and the second month together for a better price. Follow the plan and instructions it works:)</li>
    <li> Sensa definitely works.  Month 2 worked better than month 1. It has given me an awareness of fullness .  I eat much less and I feel full even with a light snack.&lt;br /&gt;Once having experienced fullness, I had to adopt a strategy&lt;br /&gt;1). Stop eating when full, even when not satisfied. There is a difference.&lt;br /&gt;2) Eat something before getting hungry again.&lt;br /&gt;3) Put sensa on  everything, no matter what, otherwise the brain does not register it.&lt;br /&gt;4) When food comes along at unscheduled times, i have to make myself aware of the difference between actually being hungry  or just experiencing desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lost about 5 pounds and about an inch around my waist.&lt;br /&gt;I am at the end of month 2 now. I am female, 80 ,160 lbs and exercise regularly.</li>
    <li> I used this product for two months thinking that maybe it takes some time to kick in, but after two months I&#x27;ve decided it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  Other reviewers like this product, but it must work differently for different people.</li>
    <li> So far seems to be working great. Just started and notice a difference in appetite. Can&#x27;t wait to see the end results.</li>
    <li> Month 1 I lost 10 pounds.  Month 2 only 1pound.  I wonder about the month 2&lt;br /&gt;product.  I am now into first week of month 3.  Still hoping it will work.&lt;br /&gt;I read that others had this same concern about month 2.</li>
    <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD -EARNED MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work for me</li>
    <li> When I remember to use it, it works very well.  I even use the cell phone app to remind me but I still forget.  I would definitely recommend it, if you can stay on track.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it. Did not work for me but wife lost 60 lbs. I think I got other problem that will not let me lose the weight.</li>
    <li> You cant use it in liquids or soups..needless to say not happy.</li>
    <li> I have used Sensa in the past and it works for me.</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase month 2 on Amazon, because SNBC hadn&#x27;t restocked their supply at the time. I noticed right away that the shakers I received from the vendor D-D&#x27;s CR were different in EVERY way than the ones I previosly purchased @ SNBC. I also noticed that the smells of the tastants are almost nonexistant. Yes I know that month two has a less powerful scent, than the rest of the months, but the scent of the product was non distinct(non-unusual), as it is with the genuine Sensa. The smells of genuine Sensa are so odd that you would recognize an immitation. I used more of this sensa on my food, wondering where is the odd smell; but still not really smelling anything. Also with Sensa you don&#x27;t have to use much of this stuff. You are supposed to smell it on your food, and smell it in your mouth when it enters the back of your nasel cavity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not good business at all. Argh!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may cost more on SNBC, but you best believe it will be a fresh batch, and it will be the real thing. Then you will absolutely experience results, when following the program.</li>
    <li> I fell into the lose weight quick gimic of this product, I tried the first month lost 5 pounds that month so was stoked I lost some weight, I ate better and was exersizing and didnt lose any weight the second month so I quit using the product, I figured I can lose weight on my own better :)</li>
    <li> lost 4 pounds in 1 month with this product and moderate exercise.  works well, will keep using this product on to month 3</li>
</ol>
