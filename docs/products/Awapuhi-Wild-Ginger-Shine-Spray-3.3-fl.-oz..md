    <li> Love the Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger line of products.  This Blow Out Spray is just what a girl with straight hair needs to add a little lift without heaviness as well as add a little hold without stiffness while styling with a blow dryer. It also helps with humidity control.</li>

    <li> This a wonderful product. MY hair has never looked so good. My hair is shiny and bright. It is esy to use and is especially helpful between shampooings.</li>
    <li> In addition to making my hair slightly shiny (not greasy looking or weighed down) it also makes my hair very soft!</li>
    <li> I love the Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Shampoo but I don&#x27;t think the spray make a big difference. I&#x27;ve used some times and I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair. I have really fine and thin hair and the spray made my hair look greasy and dirty. I usually have problems with any spray but after reading some great reviews about this product I decided to give it a try, but it was not different from others sprays. Maybe it&#x27;s my hair that doesn&#x27;t like this kind of stuff.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this hair shine spray.  It makes my highlights come to life, it smells great and even has a light hairspray hold without actually being a hair spray.  My hair is not oily or greasy with this shine spray.  I would recommend this hair shine spray to anyone who is looking for one to use on their hair.  It gives your hair a silky look and feel.  You won&#x27;t go wrong using this.</li>
    <li> This is the best product ever....I am a woman of color with natural hair and this is the only hair spray product that I have found that does not weigh my hair down.  When i wear my hair blown out straight, it gives my hair a wonderful shine all day!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great -- non-greasy, lightweight and leaves your hair with a glossy, silky look. Totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> Even though this stuff does not have any smell like the rest of the line it does leave my hair shiny. It is almost unscented which was a little bit disappointing but all in all still a good product.</li>
    <li> This is a new product by Paul Mitchell and is almost as good  as the Modern Elixis Illuminating Shine (that was discontinued)  I have gray/silver hair and the shine does may it look better.  I will continue to purchase this line of shine but still prefer  the discontinued shine.  The product is very a very light spray.</li>
    <li> I love it, please do not discontinue this product. It gives my hair a beautiful soft shine. Thanks</li>

    <li> This is a real treat to use!  It makes my hair so shiny and the light ginger scent is gorgeous</li>
    <li> It is a light shine-enhancing spray that is silicone based. A little goes a very long way. It&#x27;s good, it does what it says, but I have found that the drug store shine sprays work just as well for much less money</li>
    <li> My hairdresser just used this on my hair. It&#x27;s awesome! Totally have to buy some for myself, my mother, and my sister!</li>
    <li> Horrible!  Does not smell like one bought in salon!!  Will not buy again!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother with this spray. It made my hair feel greasy and flat. I applied it per the instructions and tried several times. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I love the shine spray and would totally give it five stars except that the seller sent me the sea salt spray</li>
    <li> My salon noe carries only Redken products, so I turned to Amazon for this.  Wonderful scent and perfect shine!</li>
