      <li>The replacement heads for this shaver are well worth the cost.</li>
      <li>This razor does exactly what it says: gives you a close, quick shave any time, day or night.     </li>
      <li>They dropped right in and functioned</li>
      <li>They were not for the right razor.  </li>
      <li>For about 20 more dollars, I could have bought a whole new shaver.</li>
      <li>The new blades make a huge difference.</li>
      <li>I received the replacement blades for my Norelco shaver in very fast time.</li>
      <li>Product was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>My husband has had his electric razor for years and this is the first time we have needed to replace the heads.</li>
      <li>Exact replacement for my Norelco razor, but</li>
      <li>This is my first electric razor.  </li>
      <li>sure enough they had some.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been a year since I bought my Cool Skin Shaver, so I ordered a new set.</li>
      <li>Being the razor is about 4 years old, buying replacement blades isn&#x27;t easy at local stores, finding them at Amazon and at a cheaper price then other sites I checked was great.</li>
      <li>My hubby is disabled from a stroke, and I am the one who handles his shaves, nice that he doesn&#x27;t flinch from old worn out blades, and the razor is easy for me to handle.</li>
      <li>He prefers the dry Norelco shaver, but does definitely use this and happy to have replacement heads so that it works like new again.</li>
      <li>You can tell right away what a difference the new heads make.</li>
      <li>Regular shaving cream works just fine.</li>
      <li>In case you&#x27;re wondering, the main body unit has performed admirably for years, the battery still holding a charge good for a few days of decent shaves.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>These replacement blades work very well.</li>
      <li>There are so many different makes and models that to shop in a store is nearly always unsuccessful.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect this, but for $30 it would have been nice, especially since, as other reviewers have pointed out, the blades and assembly have a tendency to accumulate residue, particularly if you don&#x27;t use the special Nivea shave cartridges.</li>
      <li>amazing quality (wore out several other makes)- stunning low price.</li>
      <li>somehow I do not feel the same smoothness of my shave as the blades that came originally with the razor.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
      <li>Better than my old ones, and well enough I&#x27;m not shopping for a new shaver.</li>
      <li>The performance of the razor was kike a new one!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t even look anywhere else, just order them here and by the end of the week you will feel like a new man or woman depending on what your shaving !</li>
      <li>Shaver is like new!</li>
      <li>They lack the power of the older ones.</li>
      <li>But there&#x27;s a difference in how it cuts and I was expecting to get the older HQ177 blades from someone who might still have some in inventory.</li>
      <li>Product is of a high quality.</li>
      <li>I highly reccomend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Ed</li>

    <li> These blades cut well for around a year or so.  I like this e razor</li>
    <li> Re: Philips Norelco HQ177 Cool Skin Replacement Heads for 7700 Series Shavers    Get the replacement heads for this great shaver: you WON&#x27;T be dissappointed.     Bought the Philips 7737X Electric Shaver two years ago and the shave still ROCKS! The replacement heads for this shaver are well worth the cost. I have fairly sensitive skin and have had several electric shavers in the past. After shaving with ANY sort of razor, I end up with red, irritated skin, or cuts, or both.....until now. This razor does exactly what it says: gives you a close, quick shave any time, day or night.     Being able to use it in the shower is the best benefit. Also, the included moisturizer (from Nivea) makes the shave as close as any blade, with NO irritation or cuts.      Replace the heads once a year and you&#x27;ll never have a bad shave again.</li>
    <li> Looked everywhere couldn&#x27;t find them  except here on Amazon. It&#x27;s been a year since I bought my Cool Skin Shaver, so I ordered a new set.</li>
    <li> It gave me smooth shave,  exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Changing the blades yearly is like having a new shaver yearly.  Very easy and not too expensive!</li>
    <li> just replace your shaving heads once or twice a year and you continue to get a easy smooth shave. also remember the shaving gel/lotion.</li>
    <li> I have had a cool skin razor for several years and always liked it. I finally got around to replacing the heads, and the difference in shave quality was dramatic (my old blades were at least 5 years old).  However, I only give this product three stars because the blade kit is expensive to replace yearly as recommended and only includes new blades, not an entire new blade assembly. I didn&#x27;t expect this, but for $30 it would have been nice, especially since, as other reviewers have pointed out, the blades and assembly have a tendency to accumulate residue, particularly if you don&#x27;t use the special Nivea shave cartridges. (I want to be able to use a big cheap can of Barbasol dam***!) Manufacturers are entitled to charge what they wish for their products, but I don&#x27;t have to like it.</li>
    <li> I received the replacement blades for my Norelco shaver in very fast time. Although I, ordered 2 replacements by mistake, it was very easy to return the unwanted replacement.</li>
    <li> Amazon is great. It is so easy to find items. I have looked in several towns to buy these replacements and simply typed it in Amazon and ordered it. It came as advertised, on time and in great condition. I would order from this vendor again and of course Amazon is always on my list when buying anything. No I don&#x27;t work for Amazon. Laugh.</li>
    <li> Norelco recommends annual replacement of these blades. The new blades make a huge difference. The performance of the razor was kike a new one!</li>
    <li> These replacement heads are always of quality and refurbish the razor to like new.You can only find these at amazon for some reason.You can tell right away what a difference the new heads make.The HQ177 heads give a clean smooth shave.These heads can be used on the SmartTouch models also.These heads are all slots which seem to give a smoother shave than the heads with slots and holes.As always,received quickly from Amazon with no hassle.</li>
    <li> Great shaver, as allways you need to replace the blades every year or so to keep it cutting close.</li>
    <li> Granted, the replacements aren&#x27;t quite as good as the originals, but they work well. Better than my old ones, and well enough I&#x27;m not shopping for a new shaver. It was a good buy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product now for approx. 2-1/2 years. It gives the closest shave I ever got with an electric razor. I use the lotion provided in the cartridge on spots where my beard is rough (chin area).&lt;br /&gt;It is somewhat heavier than your typical electric shaver, but the results are great. I highly reccomend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Ed</li>
    <li> I bought my 7700 series electric razor several years ago and don&#x27;t use it every day but I was noticing the shave was getting less close. Instead of buying a new razor, hundreds of dollars, I bought these heads which were a snap to change out and I feel like I have a brand new razor, man what a difference and Amazon is just about the only place you can find them. Don&#x27;t even look anywhere else, just order them here and by the end of the week you will feel like a new man or woman depending on what your shaving !</li>
    <li> Good price for replacement heads. Hard to find these sometimes at department stores, let alone for a decent price.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads are fine, as would be expected for a orig. manufacturer-branded item.    I definitely recommend using the gel-dispensing inserts over canned shave gel/cream to reduce build-up in the heads. That said, it&#x27;s not a cheap option. I&#x27;ve been using mostly Edge shave gel for at least the past year and since you can run the whole thing in water (I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower in a couple years), it&#x27;s easy to clean. Unfortunately, it will still get pretty nasty over time. And I think the inserts generally helped get a closer shave in less time. So there&#x27;s trade-offs...    In case you&#x27;re wondering, the main body unit has performed admirably for years, the battery still holding a charge good for a few days of decent shaves. I don&#x27;t let it run down too much as that drastically affects the closeness of the shave, which has never been the best, but pretty good for an affordable wet/dry. For longer trips, I typically shave every other day since the charging base is not travel-friendly.</li>
    <li> The replacement heads for the Norelco Razor makes for a great shave. I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor in years, figuring you could not get a close shave. I was wrong. The Norelco shaver is awesome.</li>
    <li> What can you say about replacement razor blades?  They either work or they don&#x27;t.  Well, these ones work just fine.  They came packaged just as if I bought them in a store.  No problems.</li>
    <li> I was originally given the Norelco razor as a gift.  I kept it for a couple of years, enough to warrant the purchase of these replacement blades.  Ultimately, the blade are fine, but as some men might experience, (especially those with coarse facial hair) will find electric razors/blades such as these to be uncomfortable.  Additionally, I often had to reshave some areas with a manual razor to achieve the close shave I desired.  Ultimately, electric razors are for some, but not all.</li>
    <li> It seems no retail store in Massachusetts ever has the HQ177 in stock.  Since its not the newest Norelco razor currently out there most stores don&#x27;t bother to stock it.  Makes no sense since most men don&#x27;t buy new electric razors ever couple of years.  They do last quite awhile and there is no need to update a razor frequently. You do need new heads and cutting blades depending on useage and thickness of your beard.  I placed my order and got the HQ177 in 2 days. Great service.</li>
    <li> This was a very convenient and cost effective way to get the right size and model razor heads. There are so many different makes and models that to shop in a store is nearly always unsuccessful.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Norelco 7775X for about a year and three months now and it is a great product.  When it came time to get replacement blades I could not find them anywhere so I looked on Amazon and sure enough they had some.  I think the price is good and they work in my razor perfectly.  I would recommend them to anyone who needs them.</li>
    <li> It was over a year we had these blades in the shaver and they still worked well.  We got this order so quick and they were just what we needed.  Great shaver and great blades!</li>
    <li> New blades for this razor and it&#x27;s like having a brand new razor for 1/4 of the cost.  I had forgotten what a great shave this razor gave until I put these blades in... I won&#x27;t be waiting so long to change them out again.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric razor.  I got it several years ago, and It&#x27;s just kind of so-so.  The issue I have at this point is that it&#x27;s becoming increasingly difficult to find parts for this thing.  Especially the shaving gel packets.    I suppose that&#x27;s more of an indictment of the razor itself, instead of the blade.  But anyway, the blade works.  I&#x27;m disappointed that it seems to be dropping out of the support sphere for Phillips Norelco.  A year from now, the machine will work fine, but I may not be able to get a blade for it.</li>
    <li> Just buy this online. It&#x27;s almost impossible to find these replacement heads in regular stores like Target, etc...    Makes a great shaver even better. If it&#x27;s been a year since you replaced your blades, or if you have no idea how long it&#x27;s been, try these.     Also, forget about the Nivea gel packs that come with this shaver. Regular shaving cream works just fine.</li>
    <li> If you never get the blades wet or use gel or creams the blades will last 5yrs or more Ive had mine 10 yrs dry shave</li>
    <li> If you own one of these shavers, then you need to replace with these every year. Buy the BEST, buy these, and shaver will stay like new!</li>
    <li> These replacement blades work very well.I&#x27;ve had a Norelco cool skin shaver for about three years and I&#x27;ve just now got around to changing the blades mostly because I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere.Don&#x27;t even try to find HQ177 replacements at traditional retail outlets such as Wal-Mart or Target because you won&#x27;t find them there.Just order them here.</li>
    <li> Being the razor is about 4 years old, buying replacement blades isn&#x27;t easy at local stores, finding them at Amazon and at a cheaper price then other sites I checked was great. Tried a few other electric razors, but always go back to the old standby.  Delivery was quick too, now my hubby has a nice smooth shave again.&lt;br /&gt;PS......My hubby is disabled from a stroke, and I am the one who handles his shaves, nice that he doesn&#x27;t flinch from old worn out blades, and the razor is easy for me to handle.</li>
    <li> As long as I can continue to get replacement heads for the 7700 Series razor, I will use this razor.  It&#x27;s great for a &amp;#34;tough beard/soft skin face&amp;#34; such as mine.</li>
    <li> Works really good.  No fuss, no bother.  It was like shaving with a safety razor without the fuss and mess.</li>
    <li> Ordered these and they came within 5 business days. Cheaper than in the stores (if you can even find them.) The original set that came with the shaver last about a year and a half, so hopefully Ill get about the same out of these...</li>
    <li> It took over one long month for delivery of this product. By the time the Norelco shaving heads reached me, my beard had grown to my waist. The proverbial and literal, &amp;#34;slow boat from China.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Shaver Knives do not work, they do not cut my beard and mustache. They are old as they are used about 1000 times before</li>
    <li> My husband has had his electric razor for years and this is the first time we have needed to replace the heads. He loves them</li>
    <li> Easy replacement.  Razor cuts like new.</li>
    <li> Item was as described and arrived promptly</li>
    <li> They actually work in the razor. Due to the age of this razor no one carries these blades locally. Will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> These blades give a smooth shave.  The blades on this razor should be changed regularly to avoid irritation.  Good Price. Good Value.</li>
    <li> I&#x60;m very pleased with this product, it works great. I will definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> The title and the image shows HQ177 but the actual product that was delivered was HQ8. Big difference and very misleading. I know they discontinued making HQ177 and HQ8 now fits models that required HQ177. But there&#x27;s a difference in how it cuts and I was expecting to get the older HQ177 blades from someone who might still have some in inventory. If I wanted HQ8, I could have purchased it from other vendors for less, but I was willing to pay a bit more because I was really expecting to get HQ177.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seller needs to change the image and the product description so it won&#x27;t be so misleading.</li>
    <li> Advertised as one thing, came as another . . . but they do fit and seems to be working fine.</li>
    <li> The replacements are not the same as the originals. I feel like my originals shaved closer. Unfortunately there is no way to purchase the originals again. besides that it works well</li>
    <li> The Norelco shaver head replacements I ordered are pretty standard.  The review I have is for Amazon - amazing! Cannot find these replacements in ANY store - Amazon to the rescue!!!! Thanks</li>
    <li> I truly like my Norelco cool shave razor and the HQ177 heads that make it work.</li>
    <li> Exact replacement for my Norelco razor, but somehow I do not feel the same smoothness of my shave as the blades that came originally with the razor.&lt;br /&gt;On a scale of 1-10 the replacement blades were 8 in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know if there is a manufacturing lot difference betweem OEM and replacement spares. Otherwise good value for money though I must say they are expensive, but this is how manufacturers make money.... make the product lower cost them make the money on the spares to keep it going.</li>
    <li> It makes my old shaver perfect.  I hate the new models of Norelco Shavers.  They lack the power of the older ones.</li>
    <li> Received item on time and in the condition as advertised. These Norelco Cool Skin Replacement heads made my Norelco electric shaver perform just as it did the day that I purchased it. Excellent value. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> gift to my hubby to replace worn heads in his shower shaver.  He prefers the dry Norelco shaver, but does definitely use this and happy to have replacement heads so that it works like new again.</li>
    <li> Arrived much quicker than expected and the works great! Shaver is like new! Also replaced battery.</li>
    <li> excellent very useful product</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as the original blades so I don&#x27;t think I will order anymore of them. Or maybe that&#x27;s not what is the matter with the shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Norelco shaver for many years. I finally damaged the screen on one of the heads by bashing it on the towel rack. So I ordered these replacements. They dropped right in and functioned perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the rub. For about 20 more dollars, I could have bought a whole new shaver. I do hate to throw away a perfectly good appliance though.</li>
    <li> Title says it all. If you ordered these thinking you were going to get the EXCELLENT HQ177 Coolskin Blades beware… They are full of it and they KNOW it. This is a deliberate deception and you will end up paying more money for a set of blades that you didn&#x27;t order. You can buy the HQ8 on PRIME with free shipping and for less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE IF YOU ARE READING THIS… SEND THEM BACK TO THE SELLER! THEY ARE COUNTING ON YOU SIMPLY KEEPING THEM AND THUS, KEEPING THE EXTRA PROFIT THEY MADE AT YOUR EXPENSE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes you have to take a stand. Please join me in complaining to Amazon directly and perhaps they can stop this deception. &amp;#34;Shavers and Replacement Parts&amp;#34; should be ashamed of themselves. They know full well what they are doing is wrong.</li>
    <li> The blades are good quality and have a good life using it every day. I will purchase it every time when replacements are required.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> They were not for the right razor.  I can&#x27;t find the correct ones.  Perhaps they are discontinued.</li>
    <li> I FOUND THE REPLACEMENT HEADS EASY TO CHANGE FROM OLDER HEADS. THE BLADES ARE GIVING ME A CLOSE SHAVE WITHOUT ANY RAZOR BURN. I WILL ORDER AGAIN WHEN NEEDED.</li>
    <li> recieved quick  and easy pppppppppppppp pppppppppppp ppppppppp p p p p p p p p p p p p p p</li>
    <li> Norelco replacement blades were easy to install and provide a cool, clean efficient shave. Product is of a high quality.</li>
    <li> Made a big improvement on my shaver.  A little pricy, though.</li>
    <li> amazing quality (wore out several other makes)- stunning low price. good quality does not have to be painful to the wallet, I may buy several for gifts</li>
