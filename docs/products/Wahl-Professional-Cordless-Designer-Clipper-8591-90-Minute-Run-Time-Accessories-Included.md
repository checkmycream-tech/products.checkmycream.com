      <li>I buzz cut my own hair.</li>
      <li>Nice to hold in hand and adjustable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found using this on my beastly front side works like a warm knife through butter.</li>
      <li>but the these new cordless designers are the best!</li>
      <li>Quality is very good, charging is fast.</li>
      <li>Runs smooth and cut my dogs hair good.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best cordless clipper I have ever owned!</li>

      <li>cordless clipper that does a great job and is light and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving my own head for about 20 years with an Oster corded clipper and over time while the blade stayed in good condition, the guards seemed to stretch so they were all falling off if you didnt hold it right.  </li>
      <li>the cut is very smooth.</li>

      <li>They are a lot more clipper than I was expecting.  </li>

      <li>I can&#x27;t express how much I love this machine.</li>
      <li>Based on my experience with cordless hair clippers, this Designer Clipper is the best of all because it saves the power of its battery for later use which is the number one feature every one must put in mind when buy any cordless hair clipper.</li>
      <li>Flimsy, rather poorly fitting comb attachments.</li>
      <li>Love them.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I got them.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I love not having to deal with a cord.</li>

      <li>to manually change between adapters (like most machines, but I had a BabyLiss machine that didn&#x27;t need adopters)&lt;br /&gt;Hard</li>

      <li>we are having issues with one pair charging but going to get them replaced will order more</li>
      <li>then it will be my most favorite clippers I have owned.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> As a hairdresser I should have bought long time ago .. Its fantastic</li>
    <li> Solid switch with a satisfying detent.  Cuts hair effortlessly.</li>
    <li> Not at all like the cord ones.</li>
    <li> The first charge lasted a long time. Wouldn&#x27;t recharge after that. Still runs on the cord though.</li>
    <li> Great Clippers! Well made, just as loud, smaller and lighter than my plug in Wahl..Comes with a lot of attachments for different preferences. So much easier to maneuver with out the cord and you can use it with a cord if you forget to charge it, i believe the other wireless models don&#x27;t allow that. So far so good. Will update my review if i have any issues.</li>
    <li> I just got my clipper an hour ago. I liked it in the beginning, but I felt something wrong with this clipper. It doesn&#x27;t look like a new. Then I checked it closer, and it saw a glue make on the left side corner of the blade. I also saw some scratches on it. They said this clipper come with a styling comb. Does anyone get one? I don&#x27;t mind missed a comb, but it shows that I was right. They didn&#x27;t send me a new one.I am so disappointed now.</li>
    <li> This is an exquisite clipper.</li>
    <li> excellent for a magnetic motor clipper.</li>
    <li> the clipper works good but quit working on battery right as return time ran out</li>
    <li> Company is very very professional at handling any issues product was shipped quickly and works well and cuts well and is very light! Love my new Wahls!</li>
    <li> I brought the clippers on a two week vacation recently, charged it once, used it three times, and they worked perfectly fine!  I wish the blades were &amp;#34;zero-gapped&amp;#34; however.  Other than that...I love &#x27;em!</li>
    <li> Great clipper, I&#x27;m no pro but I cut like one. I bought this because salons are too pricey. I looked at a few youtube videos on how to cut hair.... took a chance and poof... now I&#x27;m cutting my hubby&#x27;s hair all the time. I started out with the larger #&#x27;s juuust in case I messed something up big time.</li>
    <li> Wonderful an great delivery</li>
    <li> does what it says it will do.  A lot of choices on the clipper guards/length of trim, sturdy clipper, comes with oil for the blades.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly strong and reliable. Great for my children clients. And adults as well. I was worried these clippers would be underpowered I was wrong.</li>
    <li> Great gift item. Works. great.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT product! A great purchase if you are in the cosmetology field and have to use clippers all day!</li>
    <li> They work amazing! By far my favorite clippers so far!</li>
    <li> Love these guys! I&#x27;m a cosmetologist, and I do a lot of clipper cuts. These are light, quiet and don&#x27;t vibrate as much as my other ones. The cordless is amazing especially with clipper over comb. I&#x27;ve had them for a few days now and I&#x27;m in love and can&#x27;t stop talking about them.&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;ve had before was the wahl sterling , and wahl tapper. I love my sterling but the these new cordless designers are the best!</li>
    <li> blades do not cut that good. they get stuck.</li>
    <li> Yes ...i am using it everyday ! Thank.</li>
    <li> Really nice ! Superb quality and no cord to get in the way !</li>
    <li> Charged it up and went to work the next morning on hair , I have thick hair and it buzzed right through it . Very nice that I can take it outside !</li>
    <li> I love it so far! Hopefully they last a long time..then it will be my most favorite clippers I have owned.</li>
    <li> ordered two pair love them we are having issues with one pair charging but going to get them replaced will order more</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for 30 days and the battery is already failing. Also the zero setting cuts my hair too long and so I find myself having to cut my hair twice as often.  This is my second wahl product and both have had disappointing results with the batteries. I will not buy a wahl again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sending mine back.  The clipper doesn&#x27;t cut close enough for me.  It is much quieter than the Andis clipper that I had for about 10 years.  I don&#x27;t care for the blade alignment screws.  I removed them to attempt to get a closer cut, but you can&#x27;t adjust the blade closer and the blade adjustment screws were difficult to get back in correctly.  I&#x27;m probably going to buy another Andis clipper since my last one lasted about 10 years.</li>
    <li> Flimsy, rather poorly fitting comb attachments. Unit is lightweight and easy to handle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my own head for about 20 years with an Oster corded clipper and over time while the blade stayed in good condition, the guards seemed to stretch so they were all falling off if you didnt hold it right.  Nothing worse than a surprise cut without a guard in the middle of a shave.  This Wahl has snap on guards so I don&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;ll have that problem any longer.  The difference in ease of shaving while cordless vs. corded cant be overstated.  I&#x27;m done twice as fast, I seem to miss less spots, and I don&#x27;t knock over stuff on the bathroom counter with a cord overtime I move the clippers.  The rare win-win-win.</li>
    <li> Sorry...couldn&#x27;t resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the plug-in version of the bald head shaver from Wahl, as well as the Costco special for $35. I use this for BMS since I am rather Saskatchewan. I&#x27;ve found using this on my beastly front side works like a warm knife through butter. I have not crew-cut my hair with it yet but I seriously doubt there is any lack of power w/this unit unless you&#x27;re using it to trim hedges. It is lighter and probably mostly plastic inside, but with less mass to move the rechargeable batter has an easier time of it.</li>
    <li> Not having a silly cord in the way is great when doing fades. I loved these. But they are definitely not as powerful as corded clippers. Although these made some fades easier,  especially on squirming children,  I will not be ordering another pair.</li>
    <li> Luv it. Very smooth an light.  I will tell everyone to buy it. I will buy nothing else. It&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> So far the clippers work great. I have only cut my husband&#x27;s hair twice with them, but they work great and I love not having to deal with a cord. I went with Wahl Professional clipper because the last one I bought lasted 15 years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this amazing top of the line long lasting battery Hair Clipper as a gift for personal home use to my brother. Based on my experience with cordless hair clippers, this Designer Clipper is the best of all because it saves the power of its battery for later use which is the number one feature every one must put in mind when buy any cordless hair clipper. Another important feature of this top quality clipper is the sharp blade and super powerful motor i never experienced with any cordless hair clipper before. The bottom line, if you want to cut your hair in a professional style at home this the only best option i could ever recommend to you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the first cordless that works well, I&#x27;m pleases</li>
    <li> Went to the website saw the videos read the reviews and my clipper does not charge. Left it plugged in for 3 hours no joy, then over night then a whole 24 hours nothing ziltch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in Hong Kong and the thing was made in China so instead of sending it all the way back to the States can someone tell me who makes it so I can get it fixed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark.</li>
    <li> good hair clipper, durable battery and solid engineering.</li>
    <li> Work as well as my expensive ones and stay charged as long too.I Would recommend to anyone. I love them</li>
    <li> I purchased this clipper a few weeks ago at a professional hair show, and so far, I will give this clipper a four star rating.  Out of the box, I got the same results that I get with the corded designer.  It is advertised that it has a battery life of 90 minutes; I&#x27;m not certain yet if this claim is true.  I purchased the display model from one of the Wahl educators, so I don&#x27;t know how much of the battery life was used prior to me using it.  It is significantly lighter than the corded clipper, but it is just as powerful.  I recommend this to any professional barber or cosmotologist looking to have a back-up for the times they may lose or conserve power in their places of work or the ones looking to lighten their load as a mobile professional and desire not to carry as much weight in between jobs.  The battery life remains to be proven; however, I won&#x27;t be entirely disappointed if I don&#x27;t get 90 minutes.  Who really counts anyway?</li>
    <li> no compromise here... cordless and precise. Couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
    <li> I am a Barber and use these with every Client. Love them.</li>
    <li> Awesome! No more cord to wrestle with! Cut hair 3 times so far and haven&#x27;t had to charge again yet.</li>
    <li> Writing this after about 4 weeks, and 2-3 haircuts. I&#x27;m cutting my own hair for 18 years, with different clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Very precise and sharp: very quick cutting process, with 1-2 movements reached very even length, no skipped hairs or weird &amp;#34;lines&amp;#34; in the shaved hair.&lt;br /&gt;Good option of adopters&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No cord&amp;#34; working well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Heavier from my last machine (but still lighter than most machines)&lt;br /&gt;Noisy&lt;br /&gt;Need to manually change between adapters (like most machines, but I had a BabyLiss machine that didn&#x27;t need adopters)&lt;br /&gt;Hard to clean (under the razor)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion: would definitely buy again</li>
    <li> Will not fully charge........ way less power than expected. You can tell major difference between being plugged in to bring unplugged. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Cuts very nice don.t half to go to the barbershop anymore.Works great cordless very convient.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of clippers over the many years.  This is the best one.  Powerful, sharp, and cordless.  All good stuff.</li>
    <li> These are the first clippers I&#x27;ve ever bought I&#x27;m not a professional barber or anything. I bought them to cut my own hair from the top with the #10 and #12 guard also from Wahl, still have to go to the barber to get my hair faded from the sides though. So far they feel high quality and they cut nice, I like that they are cordless and I like the fact that it has a blue led light that turns off to let you know when its fully charged. Overall I would recommend these to professionals and anyone that wants to cut their own hair.</li>
    <li> the greatest clipper ever, recommend this product to all my friends</li>
    <li> Im a barber and these clippers are sold in our local beauty/barber supply for over $100.00...been useing them for a week...so far so good! I got two pair, one for work, and one for  cutting hubbys hair in the back yard!</li>
    <li> i actually just looked if i could return it and i missed the return day by about 10days -2weeks. When i first used it i loved that is was lighter and courless, after using it all the way untill it dies down then putting it on charger and waiting for it to be fully charged then taking it off. Now it doesnt hold a charge at all so ive been using it on the charger so i could at least still use it. After doing that for a few weeks it must have blown the battery life of sometime bc it wont even work at all now. the concept is great, but now built to last.</li>
    <li> Have not used yet, but doesn&#x27;t seem particularly well made. Was supposed to come with a plastic storage case and did not.</li>
    <li> I use this clipper 2 to three times a week, to cut my hair #8 guard and trim my beard #2 guard and it has work very well.  Love the fact I do not need a cord, it lasts about two weeks and then when it goes dead I can plug it in and be trimming in about ten minutes with the power cord.  Quality is very good, charging is fast.</li>
    <li> Stopped charging after 2 months.</li>
    <li> Great option over the home use model (the home use model includes a small ear/nose trimmer).</li>
    <li> I buzz cut my own hair. I was using a corded clipper up till yesterday when I received this beauty. I can&#x27;t express how much I love this machine. It&#x27;s light, just the right size for easy one handed operation and it runs so smooth. No cord to get in the way, one pass cutting with no fragglies left behind makes for quick work of my hair. Comes with lots of attachments, starting at 1/16 which is what I use. And it&#x27;s made in the USA, which is a huge plus in my book. Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I am a professional barber student, and saw these on Amazon and decided to try them out.  I just received them this afternoon, and after school, I opened them and played around with them.  Wow!!  They are a lot more clipper than I was expecting.  From some of the reviews here, I thought they might possibly be toyish and flimsy..  I was wrong!!  I have not cut hair with them yet, but will give them a workout tomorrow at school and see how they do.  I have charged them, which took about 30 minuters, and played around with them running.  Very impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review once I have had the chance to use them for a few days and see if I remain as impressed with them as I am now.</li>
    <li> my best friend is a barber he loved it</li>
    <li> I had this for almost a year... I will say, though it stopped working cordlessly after a month</li>
    <li> I was excited to see that the classic Wahl Designer was being offered in a cordless version. After using it professionally, I am more than pleased with the performance and quality. It offers all the best features of the classic design with the added benefits of being lighter and slimmer. The blades are the same as the corded model, so all the guards and blades that I already own are interchangeable saving me money. I love using these clippers! The battery life hasn&#x27;t failed me yet. The only test left is time. I really hope that these hold up like the corded model. I have proudly used my original designer for the past three years (over a thousand cuts, easily) without any problems. I now own two corded and one cordless pair. Next year I will add one more pair to the set to reduce the number of times I have to switch blades for technical cuts. This is a GREAT product from a well established brand. Way to go Wahl!</li>
    <li> This is a great clipper. Cuts very close and evenly. It&#x27;s light and maneuverable. Power is strong and stays that way through the job. Recharge is pretty quick. Not having a cord is a great convenience thanks to the lithium batteries.</li>
    <li> Battery life is great! I&#x27;m a full time barber and does everything a corded Wahl senior does. Blade can be adjusted to zero gap. And very lite weight. Does not get hot like regular corded clippers. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! 👍👍👍</li>
    <li> Great battery life and power; quality seems to be quite good. Power adapter seems to be able to use 240 and 120, but haven&#x27;t tested yet.</li>
    <li> Smooth operation and excellent cutting.  Replacing a Conair system that only lasted a year and a half - hopefully with the lithium batteries I&#x27;ll get a longer life span with this one.  If so, I&#x27;ll rate it 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hair stylist. Work part time and got tired of paying a fortune for cordless clippers. I had the mini one of this and never realized I could just use it plugged in. My old clippers lasted 14 months. Couldn&#x27;t directly plug in to use if battery was dead. These come with a stand however you can also just plug in to charge or use corded. Big advantage over others. Very reasonable price too.</li>
    <li> Love them favorite clippers</li>
    <li> I am pleasantly surprised at the power of this cordless clipper. Cuts great, and light weight. Probably not going to last long its made of a lot of plastic including the taper lever. Not sturdy so if its dropped I dont expect it to make it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive used both the cordless designer, and cordless magic clip and I actually like the designer a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things I dislike..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the light weight but I wish there were a premium version with aluminum housing and high quality components.&lt;br /&gt;I hate the plastic taper lever it feels cheap and flexes when making adjustments&lt;br /&gt;There are no markings to note the position of the taper lever...I like that on my masters.&lt;br /&gt;Cant speak to durability but Im not expecting much.</li>
    <li> Great product to use, I have 3 dogs (Shih Tzu) so I&#x27;m always trimming.  I have used Wahl Clippers before, but this is my first cordless and I love it...</li>
    <li> I have used these clippers for about a week now and so far so good. I do about 50-60 mens cuts a week and they cut better then expected. I feel like I can go faster since I don&#x27;t have to fuss with a cord. I just hope the chargeable battery holds up better than the Wahl chargeable trimmers.</li>
    <li> LOVE THEM! I work at a high volume mens salon, so having cordless clippers that truly hold the charge all day makes my job so much easier. It&#x27;s nice not having to constantly move the cord around my clients especially kids. They&#x27;re a little loud for my liking, but cut very clean and smooth even through the thickest ethnic hair and product &#x3D;) Buying them for retail price at $100 would be well worth it, but not an option for me, so thank you Amazon lol</li>
    <li> I been using this clipper at my shop for about two weeks and I love this clipper. It does have a little trouble taking down thick hair but it still gets the job done. I use the oster fast feeds and andis masters and this for being cordless have more power then those two clippers witch also have trouble cutting threw thick hair. The blade this clipper comes with can&#x27;t be zero gap so I got a wahl 5 star senior 2 whole blade slider and replace the blade this clipper comes with to the wahl 5 star legend blade(crunch blade/wedge blade) and it&#x27;s zero gap now and cuts close and very nice. Super light, strong motor and on a full charge I went the whole day without pluging it back in. over all great clipper beside the blade it comes with that can&#x27;t be zero gaped.</li>
    <li> Good  but not as powerful as I expected</li>
    <li> This is by far the best cordless clipper I have ever owned! I&#x27;ve had a few other models of cordless clippers that I USED to think were great...that is, until I used this clipper. I rarely need to go over the same section more than once, as it seems to cut 100% of my hair in the first pass. The previous set of clippers I used required 2-3 passes before all of the hairs were cut.</li>
    <li> Best Wahl clipper i ve purchased, so light and i am a woman i dint heavy clippers, its a great purchase for the price, lets see how long it last !</li>
    <li> works amazing, did have a problem after about 9 months where clipper wouldn&#x27;t work with out the  cord&lt;br /&gt;wahl replaced it</li>
    <li> Awesome set of clippers, I have been waiting for a long time for Li-ion to reach the hair cutting world.  My hair is pretty thick and they glide right through without a snag.  I was missing a size 5 attachment but I don&#x27;t really care, I have tons of those from previous kits.  Have not had to run it long enough to test battery time,  I think it will go for an hour or more easily.  Charging is easy to do and you can use it plugged in.</li>
    <li> The plastic casing is a little cheap feeling, but the clipper is well made and cuts very nicely.  Very smooth &amp; effective cutting action, doesn&#x27;t miss any hairs.</li>
    <li> Great clipper. Even better when you put Super Taper blades on them. Modify the screw assembly and they can be zero gapped. These are my go to clippers now.</li>
    <li> Runs smooth and cut my dogs hair good. Love the cordless feature. Can&#x27;t imagine doing it with a cord to get in the way.</li>
    <li> I’ve been cutting my own hair off and on for about 7 years now.  I go through phases when I’m tired of cutting my hair and just let it grow and then I get tired of combing my hair and so I just cut it all off. In other words, I’m lazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I’m in my lazy “cutting” phase, I use cheap corded Wahl clippers or cheap cordless Norelco clippers and both leave much to be desired. Note to self: lazy plus cheap do not make for desirable qualities in a person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with my “cheap home haircut guy” Wahl clippers were the 1) noise, 2) vibration, 3) cord 4) heat and 5) uneven cut. The problem with the Norelco clippers was a lack of power and ability to cut hair evenly when using the longer guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I thought to myself: “This is ridiculous; I need to man up and buy an expensive pair of clippers that will do what I want. Also, I should probably start exercising and lower my salt intake. But also, baby-steps.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new Wahl Cordless Designer clippers arrived yesterday and I gave myself a haircut this morning. While I’m not a professional, I can now play one on TV because these clippers are d to the ope, holmes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) They are not loud; 2) they do not have an uncomfortable vibration; 3) there is no cord; 4) they do not get hot; 5) they cut evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anything happens to change my perception of this product, I will update my review. But for now, I am one lazy, cheap, happy camper.</li>
    <li> These clippers do a great job. Excellent quality and the first cordless clippers I&#x27;ve had that don&#x27;t seem to slow down when not plugged in. These cut just as well as my corded Wahl clippers, but no cord to get in the way. Gives a very smooth, fast cut. I was hesitant to buy these at first because of the cost, but they are worth it and I&#x27;m glad I got them.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I was a little surprised and disappointed about was that they didn&#x27;t come with a full set of combs and it was missing about 4 of the combs I normally use including the Right and Left Ear Taper combs. I don&#x27;t know if not coming with a full set of combs is normal or if they were just missing from my set. I bought a full set of combs from Amazon to replace the missing ones, so that&#x27;s the reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5 and had nothing to do with the clippers themselves.</li>
    <li> I used Wahl&#x27;s since I started cutting hair. My only problem was that the clipper could would not charge when I plugged it in. When out of battery, the clipper runs fine when it&#x27;s plugged in, but as soon I take it out, it&#x27;s dead. The battery life shouldn&#x27;t be drained because it was brand new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it was an good clipper. Basic, lightweight, and  portable. I read other reviews and some did and didn&#x27;t have the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For future buyers, just FYI because you might get a faulty one like mines.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last me more than 3 months. Problems with the motor and adjuster keeps getting loose. Not a quality clipper.</li>
    <li> Charges fast and lasts for a long time  Cuts great. Case fits all components.  I&#x27;m saving a lot of money cutting my sons hair using these clippers.  It will easily pay for its self fast.</li>
    <li> This is a nice powerful (enough for my needs, anyway) cordless clipper that does a great job and is light and easy to use.  The only problem I&#x27;ve had is that the battery was dead when I went to use it last week to cut my son&#x27;s hair, even though I know I charged it after using a few weeks prior.  Hopefully this is just a one time thing and isn&#x27;t a sign of a bad battery.  I left it plugged in for an hour or so and it lasted long enough (~20 min job) to cut his hair with no loss of power.  Having no cord to work around is very convenient, especially with kids.  It works with the cord too, so either way there&#x27;s always plenty of juice.</li>
    <li> Great product. I am a male hair dresser and can do up to and over 12 hair cuts a day. It lasted my hole shift with out any worry.</li>
    <li> Bought one for husband and then bought another for son.  They both like it.  Nice to hold in hand and adjustable.</li>
    <li> I bought this cordless clipper to replace a very similar, but corded, model. I was afraid the power would not be adequate, but if anything it is slightly more powerful than the corded version, and quieter. The blade choices covered all of the lengths we needed, including a lot of variety in the shorter lengths, which is mostly what we use. It was efficient in cutting, comfortable, and left very few hairs uncut.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue (and it&#x27;s minor) is that the storage box it comes with is quite small and does not stay closed. If I could, I would give it 4.5 stars, because that issue is little more than an annoyance. I will probably just buy a different box to store it in, but of course would prefer not to have to. Other than that, it is a terrific product.</li>
    <li> Great product! Quick delivery and helpf payment options. Very pleased with entire experience!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months now.  I use it once per week for a close trim.  I&#x27;ve charged the battery twice.  Once when I got it.  Once a week ago.  Great power.  Clean cut.  I wish I purchased it long ago.  I&#x27;m glad to be rid of the cord.</li>
    <li> Amazing.  Best clipper I ever used.  I clip both my 3 year old twin boys, and while it buzzes, it is quiet enough the boys do not panic.  And without a cord to wrestle with while clipping, I can finish both kids hair in under 10 minutes.  I also clip my husband&#x27;s hair, and have not had to recharge the batttery yet.  I clip them every 4 weeks and have had the clipper 2 months now.  I can not say enough good things about how easy it is to use without a cord, and it is lighter than most clippers with cords, also making it easier to use.  Absolutely one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made....</li>
    <li> Dope. I use it in my travel barber bag. Def can&#x27;t notice the difference in power. And much better for a carry around clipper</li>
    <li> Works perfect,it is strong. the cut is very smooth. Is very light and thin. The design is very cool it fits your hand pretty nice, very comfortable. The &amp;#34;taper lever&amp;#34; part seems to be kind of weak if you put a little strength on it it bends. the red blade guard came like struck with a white spot on the plastic. Battery works perfect, i used it like 5 days ago ( first use, i charge it 5 hours as instructions indicate before first use) and today it still has enough charge to work. Blades adjust and fits perfect. It comes with a little oil bottle, i think it should come with a bigger and better presented oil (has a very &amp;#34;made on china&amp;#34; presentation). Clipper case (box) has 0 stars, it is very weak, ugly, unstable,bad quality. Maybe case (box) design could improve. A nice feature is that you can use it even it is uncharged connected to the power supply. Clipper seems to be well built. Charger has a detachable connection but has just one. hope this machine works for years</li>
    <li> I have not been to a barbershop for over 45 years and do not plan to start now.  My wife has always cut my hair and during these years we have used a variety of devices.  This one has worked well, although I tend to use a spacer in most places so as not to avoid cuts.</li>
    <li> Absolutely great. Used this several times and no disappointments.</li>
    <li> I have only used this 4 times now but it is so much better than my old Remington.  The motor sounds stronger, it cuts so much cleaner and I love that its cordless.</li>
    <li> The clippers themselves seemed well constructed and the convenience of cordless was a plus. My only real issue was it lacked power. Even at full charge the power was weak. I reordered the Wahl 5 Star Magic which needs to plugged into a socket and I am completely satisfied with it. I don&#x27;t think the battery technology is there for cordless to compete with the plug in models yet.</li>
    <li> I have purchased an assortment of hair clippers over the years, and most start off good, but somewhere along the way they break or stop recharging or generally stop working for one reason or another. This particular model does impress me with motor power and ergonomics. The balance is very nice in hand and it cuts hair very well,, so I say I&#x27;m cautiously optimistic. It holds a charge for a very long time without loosing torque. You can use it with the power cord connected or without being tethered for mobility. I give it 4 stars because I believe the $75 price point is just way too expensive for a clipper whose technology is quite simple and mass produced by a company that&#x27;s been manufacturing hair clippers for a long, long time.</li>
    <li> Great! And made good time!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter that works in a very upscale Nashville salon, and she is more than pleased with these clippers.  As a matter of fact, she thinks her colleagues are envious of her new clippers and is protective of them!</li>
    <li> I bought this to cut my own and my two sons&#x27; hair and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  This clipper is very quiet and smooth, cuts easily, and the cordless operation is very convenient.  At this price there&#x27;s no Reason to buy a lesser model anywhere else.</li>
    <li> nice style and light weight for this item. they work right out the box but it is required to charge them before use. they are great and come with attachments oil and guards.</li>
    <li> These clippers are very powerful and light. As a barber they really make my job easier.</li>
    <li> Very pleased, would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase of the WAHL 85910 cordless designer clipper. They come in handy when traveling.</li>
    <li> This is a great clipper for the money. Can feel it&#x27;s made well not light piece of plastic. Seems to have a lot of power when you turn it on. Mine is only for home use but wanted something that would last with lithium ion battery. There cheaper model had a lot of bad reviews so I chose this one. Very happy with purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update. Been over two years now and these Clippers work as good as the day I bought them.</li>
    <li> actually the plastic covering feels a little cheap, but overall the device performs remarkably well.</li>
    <li> Good clippers but looked used</li>
    <li> Powerful clippers without needing to worry about a cord.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This item works great!  Works just as well as any AC powered clipper but without the cord getting in the way.  Seems to be a well build machine that will last many years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had these clippers for a month and a half, but I absolutely love them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a guy and I use the clippers for shaving my head and trimming body hair. I use them quite often and so far I haven&#x27;t had to recharge the clippers yet so the battery lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the same corded Wahl clippers since 1995 (that&#x27;s almost 20 years) and they finally bit the dust before purchasing these. Wahl makes a high quality product and the cordless model is so much better than a corded model in my opinion for more than a few reasons. I disliked having the cord getting in the way when shaving my head. It&#x27;s also nice as a man to be able to do my &amp;#34;manscaping&amp;#34; in the bathtub without having a long extension cord running across the bathroom so that the hair doesn&#x27;t make a mess all over the bathroom floor. In my hand they feel like quality clippers, but at half the weight of my old clippers, which is another plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guarantee you&#x27;ll be happy with these clippers. And if they last 20 years like my old Wahl clippers, I&#x27;ll still continue to be one happy customer.</li>
    <li> Arrived early and was everyhting I expected. Great purchase</li>
    <li> Great hair cutting and trimming tool. Extremely well made and powerful. This clipper is just as good as any you will find in a barber shop. The battery life is phenomenal. If you want professional results in your own home, this is the clipper to get.</li>
    <li> As someone who is losing his hair at the back of his head, I had decided to remove most of my hair and was thus I was looking for a clipper. I previously used a $20 Costco Wahl that needed new guides and after seeing the price of them, decided to upgrade entirely. I am glad I did! Aside from everything else, I no longer have to drag the cord with me when I use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great! I keep my hair at about 1/4&amp;#34; and trim it once a week or so. The battery in this lasts a long time - I normally go a few months in between charges! It&#x27;s well built and comfortable to hold - the designers clearly put some thought into the way different people would use it and made it comfortable for multiple positions. It looks a little like an odd shape but I assure you it feels fine in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You wanna know the best part? Of course you do. The switch. The ON/OFF switch on this is one of my favorite switches. It has that satisfying mechanical switch feel to it - a little resistance than that *CLICK* as it goes into position.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted great shipping excellent product and great price!</li>
    <li> i am aa hair stylist and have always used clippers with cords but i have only had my new cordless clippers for a week and i absoultely love them!! nice and smooth cut especially when blending. i do alot of mens cuts and these are perfect.</li>
    <li> Very light.  Makes trimming around the ears and neckline easier than compared to my ancient plug-in clippers...j</li>
    <li> Exceptionally quick same day delivery! Lightweight, battery life holds up to several client haircuts, but if you plug in the cord in between clients you can cut up to 14-20 per say with it holding a charge.  Con: Be very careful of your transformer placement,  as the cord will short out if it gets bent or twisted. Note: Whal will replace the cord if this happens.</li>
