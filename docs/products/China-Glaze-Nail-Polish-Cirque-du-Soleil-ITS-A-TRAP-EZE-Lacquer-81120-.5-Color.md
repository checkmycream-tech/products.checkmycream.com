<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ok this is a beautiful polish completely different then any that I have definitely happy I have one BUT it came kinda thick like its been old used and sitting forever but I added a few drops of remover to thin it out so its ok now but when you buy something new you should expect better consistency on first opening so that&#x27;s why it got down graded by me.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product ! It has become one of my faves</li>
    <li> The description for this polish said that it was NEW, and never used. However, when I received it and opened the bottle for the first time, it appeared that somebody had used it before, as there was crusted polish around the opening of the bottle. How disappointing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides this problem, I love this polish! The base is a blue-white, with multicolored glitter pieces throughout. The seller obviously loved it as well, since it came to me used.</li>
    <li> Very cute and fun polish. Very hard to get off also. But I still wear it</li>
    <li> Delivered before I expected but the brush was not screwed on tight so it leaked in the packaging. Luckily I got to it before too much got out but the outside of the bottle is ruined. Definitely not the best choice of packaging for shipping nail polish.</li>
    <li> Love this! So young and fun!</li>
    <li> This nail polish topper is so dope that&#x27;s it!!! It goes great with any color!!!</li>
    <li> I wish I had ordered more than one bottle. They colors are great and the milky white contrast makes it subtle. I used mine with a bright under color and got tons of compliments :) definitely a great addition to anyone&#x27;s nail polish collection!</li>
    <li> I first used this polish at a shop and loved it. I could not find it anywhere when i finally stopped in Sally&#x27;s and was informed that the polish was discontinued. I then looked on china Glaze&#x27;s website to order it and couldn&#x27;t because their site SUCKS!!!! I then found it on here. It was delivered in a timely manner and I am happy!!!!</li>
    <li> This color was recommended to me by a fellow nail polish lover and it&#x27;s a really pretty glitter and goes on great.</li>
    <li> I love the color a lot, I was looking for something similar to Oh, Splat and I found it. The only issue I have is that the color chips really easily. Which is surprising, considering it&#x27;s a glitter nail polish. The color is a really pale blue, so it&#x27;s pretty sheer as well - takes a few coats. But overall, I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted this nail polish for forever, and I couldn&#x27;t resist the deal that it was on here.... It&#x27;s just awesome.</li>
    <li> This polish is so much fun. You can use it alone with 3 coats or put a thin coat over another color to spice it up. Really a great mix and I love the white base.</li>
    <li> My daughter has this polish that I bought her.  It is really colorful, and makes her nails so shiny, and bright.</li>
    <li> Very pretty polish, looks great with black stamping over.  Like some other China Glaze glitters I have tried, this one chips pretty easily after only a day or two.  I change my polish frequently, so no big deal, but if you&#x27;re looking for something that will wear well, this definitely isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> this is a really cute polish color! Its not necessarily a grayish-blue with sparkles like it looks in the picture. its more of a milky color, but the sparkles in it are so cute. It reminds me of pop tarts! Plus its great to put on top of a pastel polish. I like to wear it over china glaze&#x27;s &amp;#34;electropop aquadelic&amp;#34; or essie&#x27;s &amp;#34;play date.&amp;#34; And just to forewarn you... like any glitter, it is extremely hard to get off. The trick is to soak them, ladies! :)</li>
    <li> This is a milky base with multicolor glitter of varying sizes. There is plenty of glitter and it looks pretty good with two coats. This is really fun to wear.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the rough texture that the bits of coloured &amp;#34;confetti&amp;#34; leaves on my nails. I won&#x27;t be buying this one again.</li>
    <li> Not the color i thought it was, before i purchased. Dont like the color at all but China Glaze is a very good product</li>
    <li> I like this China Glaze color It&#x27;s a Trape-eze, but I don&#x27;t love it. It was the perfect nail polish to wear on my birthday, because it reminds me of birthday cake with confetti icing. However, it&#x27;s not an everyday color for me, which is why I only gave it 3 stars. China Glaze polishes are always long lasting though, so if you like what you see I would definitely recommend buying it.</li>
    <li> Pretty cute, but the base is gray, not white, and since it goes over some of the glitter, I thought my nails looked a little...dirty, I guess.</li>
    <li> But it&#x27;s certainly festive!  And has the same wonderful quick coverage for aging nails that the Fairy Dust does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see myself using it for maybe the 4th of July - and maybe Christmas!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really pretty.  But not me on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I got this in the mail yesterday! I was so excited to put it on! It is such a cool color with awesome glitter. Its not a white color and not a grey, but somewhere in between. The glitter is red, blue, pink, yellow, green. Just a rainbow of glitter! I will say, I did have to put about 4 thick coats on, and it took a little while to dry, but I couldn&#x27;t be more happy! I LOVE this one, I will be buying more :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the color choices of the glitter but be sides that its pretty could use only one coat.</li>
    <li> This is a very unique polish. It&#x27;s pretty chunky, but I believe that&#x27;s normal because it is packed with glitter. You can do one coat, or more if you want it opaque. Delivery was about normal. I think this polish is a good one to have in your collection, and it reminds me of cake batter;)</li>
    <li> Nice &amp; came super fast (4 days) for free shipping. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I applied the nail polish over an other color thinking that it had a transparent liquid but I just made a mess. It looks great on its own. the colors of the glitter are really pretty. I don&#x27;t give it a five because it can be a little messi because the glitter pieces are really big and they kind of clump toghether. But other than that it&#x27;s nice.</li>
    <li> Thought I would enjoy wearing sparkle. Guess it is made for younger people.</li>
    <li> I love China Glaze nail polish! They have such awesome colors and glitters! This one&#x27;s really unusual. Repeat buyer will buy again. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I got this with free shipping which was great,  it came right on time. Shipping stated from the 10th to 15th and I got it on the 10 th. I was very impressed with shipping and packaging. The color is gorgeous! I love glitter bombs and indie polish though I don&#x27;t have the $$ for indies :-( and this happily makes me think of a indie polish. The glitter is beautiful and it&#x27;s packed. One coat as a topper and by itself makes a great mani! I wish they had more polish like this!</li>
    <li> This nail polish is super groovy and super cute!&lt;br /&gt;This is defiantly a must have if your into glitter!&lt;br /&gt;Im super happy i purchased this nail polish, it makes me really happy to see it in my collection.&lt;br /&gt;The formula is just perfect.</li>
    <li> Not the typical glitter but the typical (and awesome) China Glaze quality. Applies easily and no digging for glitter. Smooths out with a coat of Seche Vite.</li>
    <li> Very unique polish. Loved the look. With this being a glitter polish it was extremely hard to remove. That&#x27;s why I have it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> This polish consists of multiple sized foil hex-ish glitters suspended in a really light blue jelly--almost white, maybe even a blue-based white. The glitter is fairly dense, so can take only one coat depending on the look. Can be worn alone, opaque in 2-3 coats, or over another color, or I suppose as a single opaque coat over bare nails. I personally really like it as a sheer coat over turquoise, with a matte topcoat. Subtle enough for a full-hand manicure, but also great as an accent. Consistency slightly on the thicker side, but by no means needs to be thinned. Drying time normal.</li>
    <li> Came quick ( haha) and was what I wanted so yup yup I&#x27;m a happy customer! I really love this color it&#x27;s so unique.</li>
    <li> Amaaaaazing nail polish, absolutely love this stuff! Glitter polish is my thing. I am always trying to find one that I don&#x27;t have and when I saw this I knew I needed it in my collection.&lt;br /&gt;the coverage is great. It&#x27;s semi-dense colorful large and small hexi glitter. I was surprised by how evenly it covered.&lt;br /&gt;this is great for a full mani or even for accents or accent nails. There are a lot of colors in it so there are a lot of choices for polish to go with it.  There&#x27;s green, orange, blue,  purple, yellow and silver. I used it on my toes and did a reverse stamp accent nail that utilized all those colors. Turned out so well! And I used a white base as it&#x27;s suspended in white but isn&#x27;t enough to cover.&lt;br /&gt;you could put a couple of top coats on afterwards to make it feel smooth. You definitely need to because the glitter will catch on fabric and whatnot. Or if you use a gel topmost it only takes one. It&#x27;s very chippy without.&lt;br /&gt;very fun polish, one of my new favorites</li>
    <li> First if all, it was supposed to come on the 27th and arrived on the 23rd! Yay! It was in a tiny, bubble-wrapped envelope, and the nail polish itself was rolled in another sheet of bubble wrap. Much better than other places that just shove the nail polish in a huge box...&lt;br /&gt;Even though I had JUST painted my nails, I ran to get the nail polish remover as soon as this arrived. I love the color! Its very confetti-ish. You can use one coat to go over a light color, (the sparkles are very easy to get on the brush) or use it as itself. I used 3 coats, which I think is enough. As I mentioned before, you really don&#x27;t have to go digging for sparkles. Just dip the brush in, and you get plenty! :) I&#x27;m definitely planning on buying China Glaze nail polish from this seller again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally would&#x27;ve said five stars but it chips sooooo quickly. :( Other wise, I love it!</li>
    <li> this color does not at all look as good as it does in the picture, it&#x27;s a milky semi-translucent white filled with multi-shaped glitter, i would not recommend this and if i could return it i would</li>
    <li> This is such a unique polish and I love it. It is great because if your polish chips you can apply more and it looks the same. However, it takes 3-4 layers to fully cover the nail. Great purchase overall</li>
    <li> I just put this on - again - for my &amp;#34;Spring&amp;#34; look!  This time I put it on over  a hot pink - and the effect is fabulous!  One of the prettiest polishes in my collection (which is huge)!  I love this polish and will purchase it again!</li>
    <li> verry different with white back ground instead of clear bu great with all colors of polish,!</li>
    <li> This color is awesome. I love it &amp; use it often. Would definitely recommend this color to anyone that loves glitter polish.</li>
    <li> Wonderful polish.  Great for any time of the year.  Can use alone or with other color polishes.  Will buy more.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!! Beautiful color and great quality!!!!!!!! Would definently buy this product again. I tried for a week to find this product at stores and this was the only place I could find it!</li>
    <li> ITS JUST PLAIN AMAZING AND I LOVE THE LOOK ON MY FINGER NAILS :) And shipping was very  fast :)  I totally recommend this item to all the ladies out there even teens :)</li>
    <li> When I received the bottle of polish I was concerned because it didn&#x27;t appear like the image posted here. The bottle seemed to have far more visible glitter. This must just be part of the settling process or the stock images are meant to highlight what the polish looks like on. It really is a beautiful and fun polish. It reminds me of funfetti. It goes on easily and looks like the samples of this color I have seen on other sites. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I got this in the mail today(dec 31)-much sooner than the estimated delivery date of January 2nd- 7th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately put it on my nails even though I had 3 other nail polishes delivered along with this one. I have been super excited about this nail polish since I saw the first swatches of it.  The color is a light GREY with LOTS of glitter in it. Seems like a lot of people are under the impression that it is a pink base. It isn&#x27;t. I put 2 coats on and got loads of glitter. And it looks great. This will be my New Years Mani. Fantastic nail polish. Beyond pleased with this order. : )</li>
    <li> This is just a party in a polish!  Looks great, whimsical without being too obnoxiously loud.  The same high quality formula I have come to expect as \\&quot;standard\\&quot; for Chine Glaze.  Milky-colored base with pink/teal confetti glitters.  Brings to my mind memories of \\&quot;bubble-gum\\&quot; ice cream from when I was a little kid. FUN &amp; DIFFERENT!!</li>
    <li> I love this color. Other customers have complained that it may be harder to remove or lacks a solid whitish color. But, there&#x27;s ways around those problems! For heavily caked-on polish, be it glittery or not, just soak the nails for an extra 10, 20, or even 30 seconds (depending on how many layers you&#x27;re removing) and it will come off no problem. As far as getting a solid color along with the glitter goes, you should probably use 2 or more layers for an opaque effect. This one chips a little easier than other China Glaze polishes, but I am currently wearing this color, I&#x27;ve had it on for 3 days now and no major chips or anything yet!I only had to touch up 2 really small spots, China Glaze holds up extremely well.</li>
    <li> everything I expected and more &amp;#60;3 I love this nail polish, the fact that it&#x27;s some sort of milky makes it great!</li>
    <li> this color does not at all look as good as it does in the picture, it&#x27;s a milky semi-translucent white filled with multi-shaped glitter, i would not recommend this and if i could return it i would</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift. It arrived ahead of time (estimation was like feb 2-7, I got it on jan 31), and I had actually just painted my nails maybe 5 minutes before delivery. But I still wanted to put it on immediately, so I painted it over the light blue that was on my toes. It&#x27;s milky enough to go on well over another color, but it seems like it wouldn&#x27;t be too difficult to build up on its own.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend layering it over a pastel for an ideal spring mani. The colors remind me of Pop Tarts :)</li>
    <li> I have similar glitter polish made by KBShimmer &#x27;Oh Splatt&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a milky base glitter polish and the result was same as the picture on the website.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to compare this one, it&#x27;s got more sparkly glitters in it, but too much.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick to oh splatt.</li>
    <li> I get tons of compliments on this polish. I like to keep something on my nails to keep from biting them and this is great. I can just keep adding layers if is chips or peels and it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rating this 5 stars because of the formula and how well the glitter packs on. The mix of glitter reminds me of cupcake sprinkles. This is a polish I&#x27;d recommend wearing by itself, or over white or light gray; the base gets opaque in about 2 coats.</li>
    <li> its a beautiful color I like a lot of the whites with a lot of glitter and pastels with glitter they are great colors for spring. shipped fast so I was able to wear it within a few dayys of my order</li>
    <li> Pretty colors! Had to paint 2 coats on for it to show up good on my fingernails. Otherwise, it looks cool when dry!</li>
    <li> Love it but it&#x27;s really hard to get off.  Definitely be prepared to use a little more effort when taking off this nail polish.  Other than that the color is fun and looks good.</li>
