      <li>I bought this little machine and liked it so much I ordered refill rollers fearing I would wear them out soon.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great price and effective. Fast ship and great price. I walk around barefoot all the time, this helps keep the feet and heels looking good.</li>
    <li> feet are like a baby butt</li>
    <li> They work great and are a great replacement for the Emjoi.</li>
    <li> These work great with the Emjoi Micro Pedi.  They&#x27;re not cheap but they&#x27;re worth it.</li>
    <li> I have really bad dry skin on my heels, and other methods of removing it have been unsatisfactory. I like the Emjoi machine that these fit very much, but these rollers are not really &amp;#34;extra coarse&amp;#34;. They help remove the dead skin, but I wish they were even more coarse, since they don&#x27;t remove all that is needed, even after going over the same area multiple times. This works better than creams or hand-held scrapers, but I need an even stronger roller.</li>
    <li> Good for smoother spots.</li>
    <li> It filled alll my desires</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product</li>
    <li> We love the emjoi refill rollers the price can,t be beat and the quality is excellent, will order again.</li>
    <li> To be fair, I haven&#x27;t used other types of rollers but these work great.</li>
    <li> I bought this little machine and liked it so much I ordered refill rollers fearing I would wear them out soon.  They last longer than I expected and are as wonderful as the Emjoi machine.  My calluses aren&#x27;t thick but are tough.  It takes very little time to use, the roller and batteries are still going strong, and it is so easy to use.  My feet feel and look much better.  Have already recommended this product to several people.</li>
    <li> JUST WHAT I ORDERED AND RECEIVED JUST FINE.</li>
    <li> Love these refills. One roller lasts me with bi-daily use about 2-3 month</li>
    <li> They do wear out with use. These are a bargain.</li>
    <li> Emjoi refill rollers are the best ,they really do remove the dry skin from your feet well.Without any pain and&lt;br /&gt;very smooth. i would recommend this prouduct to anyone who like to have nice feet for men and women.&lt;br /&gt;You have to have one.</li>
    <li> These were good, not QUITE like the authentic  ones, but still do the job. Just takes a bit longer. I would buy again. But probably would go up to the next  more course option.</li>
    <li> Just Love my Pedi and the refill rollers!!  Excellent product!!</li>
    <li> I bought the micro pedi that uses these rollers. I love the sanding effect which is much nicer than the cutting wheel on other other dead skin removers.</li>
    <li> Probably not &amp;#34;as good&amp;#34; as original but gets the job done. I also do my elbows and knees. Do love the Emjoi and will continue to buy these.</li>
    <li> The Micro-pedi is a great little machine, but it would be nothing without the refill rollers.  I ordered them and received them in the time I expected them.  They fit my Micro-pedi, and I am good to go.</li>
    <li> Just Love my Emjoi Pedi refill rollers! Will come back for more, great price, great product.</li>
    <li> Can be a little overwhelming...sometimes a little too coarse.</li>
    <li> These were fine for smoothing the sides of my feet, but forget it when it came to the callouses on the bottom of my feet. &amp;#34;Extra-coarse&amp;#34; is not how I would describe these.</li>
    <li> These rollers do a great job to help get rid of those nasty calluses. So easy to use -- I love it.</li>
    <li> These replacement rollers work great.  This is a much better way to purchase them as well.  It saves you money.</li>
    <li> These rollers have given me back my sandal feet!  Very effective at removing dry skin and callouses.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> great product it is addicting  I can get my feet smooth enough after all these years of calluses but I&#x27;m almost there  you have got a customer for life. just bought one for my best friend she loves it too. I will be buying more thanks julie</li>
    <li> Decent replacement for Emjoi Micro-Pedi.  Emjoi Rollers are 3-4 times more expensive so&lt;br /&gt;even if doesn&#x27;t last as long, still worth the money.</li>
    <li> These fit my Micro-Pedi great. They are just like the Emjoi brand, just less expensive. I would like to try a coarser roller for my husbands feet, but these are good for everyday use for me.</li>
    <li> This fit the shaver perfectly, yet cost much less than the name-brand refills that are made for it. The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because they seem to either be less coarse than the originals or the coating wears off of them really quickly. I&#x27;d guess it to be that they are just less coarse to begin with. I don&#x27;t have really tough calluses to buff off, so would not normally need to order the extra-coarse versions. But I&#x27;m considering doing so for these &#x27;generic&#x27; brands and crossing my fingers they aren&#x27;t taking my tender skin off in the process. Hopefully, the &#x27;rough factor&#x27; is consistent with the generics and by going up one level, I can find the right thing. For those of you with REALLY tough calluses, I&#x27;d skip these entirely and go for the next level (or two). They do fit perfectly though, so no worries there. And the price is great!</li>
    <li> Emjoi is the best exfoliator for my feet. After I use it my heels are baby smooth. The refills last for me because I rinse them off after use. Not sure if that&#x27;s what you are supposed to do but it works fine for me.</li>
    <li> they work and the price is super</li>
    <li> Works great.  I find it comparable to the original ones.</li>
    <li> Been using my Micro-Pedi about a month and haven&#x27;t had to replace my roller yet. These should last a long time.</li>
    <li> I love my emjoi  micro pedi that I purchased after Christmas .  I ordered replacement rollers for my micro pedi.  I used one roller( the one it came with) all winter .  I am going to use the replacement rollers next fall.  They last a while and are great.</li>
    <li> i am happy with emjoi products and with my delivery from amazon  fast and easy.thank you</li>
    <li> Works just like the one that came with the unit.  Love the Emjoi Micro-Pedi machine and will always have an extra roller around.</li>
    <li> Received and and works as promised and described!</li>
    <li> Emjoi compatible, just as described, works perfect!</li>
    <li> Good refills, shared with my son-in-law and family.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE THE SAME ROLLERS SOLD ON THE TV SHOPPING CHANNEL WE ALLL LOVE !  BUT THESE PRICES ARE SO MUCH BETTER  !!</li>
    <li> Really great product. I assume if you are buying the refills, you know how good it is.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the Prudocte &amp; the Delivery.</li>
    <li> As good as the original emoji rollers. Will purchase again. Great price.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin, especially my heels - these work very well, they also make a finer coarse and an Extra Strong coarse.  I find the Extra Coarse works best for me</li>
    <li> Great product! Helps keep my feet very smooth and I only have to use it twice a week for a few minutes.</li>
    <li> Works just like the original ones that came with the product. Much cheaper than ordering from Emjoi.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this. For years she used a hand file so having an electric file makes it much easier for her.</li>
    <li> Excellent transaction, highly recommend</li>
    <li> I will definitely buy this again. It is a great product and it works well. It is well priced too!!</li>
    <li> I love this system. It is easy to use and gets the job done.  I plan on using until it dies.</li>
    <li> Always fine a great deal on amazon.... Will come back for more emjoi micro pedi refills!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been enjoying my Micro pedi and this roller works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Love this item, really works.</li>
    <li> My emjoi micro pedi worked wonderfully.  thanks.</li>
    <li> Very effective. Cleans easily with dry toothbrush for extended use.</li>
    <li> Does a good job of removing dead skin.  Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I go barefooted most of the time so I am prone to dry heals.  This keeps them smooth and soft.  The roller last for many uses.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  JUST AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL AND SUCH A FANTASTIC PRICE.  WORKS GREAT!!!!!  WILL DEFINITELY BUY  AGAIN.</li>
    <li> good but didn&#x27;t last as expected</li>
    <li> They do an extremely good job at keeping my feet smooth.  I am quite pleased with them.</li>
    <li> Not as expected. Thought this would be stronger than the original rollers but it turned out to be the same.</li>
    <li> Love being able to get refills.  Great!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. Just wish the refill rollers worked a little bit better at removing the calluses.</li>
    <li> Better than using the Pedi egg. It makes my feet feel nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> These work just as well as the ones that came with the Emjoi.  I ordered the extra-extra coarse as well and was pleased with those.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Like the product &amp; was worried about replacements.  No worry, Amazon came through quickly.</li>
