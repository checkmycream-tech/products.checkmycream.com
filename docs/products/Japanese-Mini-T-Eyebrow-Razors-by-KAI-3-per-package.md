The problem I had with them is that the face of the blade is very deep, making it difficult to get the actual sharp razor edge close to anything you might want to use it on, on a woman&#x27;s face.  They are simply  much too thick to be able to use them on my eyebrows or upper lip.  I can&#x27;t get close enough under my nose to use them for what I purchased them...my upper lip! A waste of money!  Even at under $9.00!  There are better facial razors out there.  The single blade, straight edge on a handle type facial hair remover for me, from now on!</li>

They were out of stock when I went to order so I got the ones on this page instead... I wish I would&#x27;ve waited!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** [[ASIN:B000FYOXFO Petite Mini T Grooming Safety Razors]]</li>
    <li> They were sharp, the right size for the small areas that needed to be shaved. Great for the bikini area.</li>
    <li> Again, these little razors just don&#x27;t stay sharpened as much as I would like. I find that I can&#x27;t put them in my purse without wrapping them up in a Kleenex. Too bad.</li>

    <li> very shard and you need to be carefull especially to the first users..i love it,its still sharp and need to be carefull</li>
    <li> Why oh why do they call these things eyebrow razors?  The razor part is way too wide to fit in the space between your brow and eye.  I tried contorting myself every which way to get the stray hairs I was targeting.  I ended up bloody in three different places.  You have been warned!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quality is very good. But I think it&#x27;s little hard to be used for me.</li>
    <li> Great for doing the fine work around your goatee. I&#x27;ve used them for years.</li>
