      <li>These were exactly as described.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have small hand so I need to fold it on my fingers but anyway I use it with every manicure and protects my hands from the lamps UV light. The results will just be evident in the long run but is practical and I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> Gloves are made to fit very small hands. Thumb hole gets into polish as you are applying it.</li>
    <li> Got these for a friend who has an older UV lamp. She loves them, and says they protect her hands and wrist areas well. Good purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought 2 pairs. One for use when doing my nails under the UV light, and one for working in the yard. I can not have sun exposure to my hands/arms. Works great. A tad snug, but otherwise a good product and value priced.</li>
    <li> Comfy, long enough for my long fingers</li>
    <li> Great idea for protecting your hands while curing under the UV lamp! My daughter is constantly doing her nails so I think she&#x27;ll love them. Also great deal as an add on.</li>
    <li> I wear these every time I do my nails - they make me worry less about the UV damage to my hands. They&#x27;re great quality.</li>
    <li> These fit perfect and does the trick to pretext my hands and arms from the light. The extra length is helpful to ensure full protection.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit and good protection from UV rays during gel fill.</li>
    <li> I got these as a free addon to the UV nail dryer. I got it for my wife and I think she&#x27;s going to like them. They look a little small as far as width but I think they&#x27;ll do ok. Plus, you can&#x27;t beat free.</li>
    <li> I do not have large arms but I think these would be small if you are on the heavy side.  They fit me well.</li>
    <li> I like it.  I have smaller hands than average so when I use it I have to fold the finger openings.  The length of the glove is really long.  I should have got the shorter one, but that is something I can deal with.</li>
    <li> These gloves are great! They&#x27;re inexpensive and really long so they cover up your whole arm. They&#x27;re pretty soft and easy to put on. I have big hands and they cover me well.. someone with small hands and short fingers may find that the finger holes, and especially the thumb hole, cover their nail too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I use them every time I give myself an at home gel manicure. The only con- they&#x27;re WHITE! I would love these in a darker  color... I&#x27;ve already gotten dark nail polish on them and they are starting to look dirty. Although, I suppose that&#x27;s user error more than anything else :)</li>
    <li> they look pretty but they slip off and the nails start to get covered slowly so one need to stop several times and correct them. now I just dont wear them anymore. I just put them on top of my hands while the nails are drying. plus they do not really cover from the rays, it&#x27;s in the specs when you get it. i should have returned them when I got them</li>
    <li> Protects your arms while you let them dry in UV nails driver,  I would recommend very much for your own protection.</li>
    <li> perfect...no more UV exposure with gel manicures!</li>
    <li> I had no problem putting them on, but I can see how somebody else with thicker arms can have a problem.</li>
    <li> These gloves comes in very handy if you do your nails a lot like I do (once or twice a week). I had to roll the thumb and pinky up a little but that&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
    <li> The UV Protective Gloves for UV Light / Lamp / Nail Dryer &amp; LED UV Nail Dryer Curing  Does the job. However not everybody has long fingers. I had to fold down where my fingers were so I could paint my nails. Still will recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> Gloves fit well &amp; I expect they will work well. They look like they will offer good protection. (I haven&#x27;t used them yet because my Gelish LED light cures so quickly!) I should really get into the habit of using them though.</li>
    <li> One size does not fit all, maybe it fits most. The thumbs are  very uncomfortable for myself and the fingers are too long for my relativly small hands. The ends barely go up my arms, they are tight so I keep pushing them back down.</li>
    <li> I have average sized hands, and they fit perfect. Except my pinky- the glove is a little long. Other than that they are nice quallity and comfortable. Shipping was immaculately fast!!! Thank you for a wonderful product that came free with my lamp!</li>
    <li> I got these to cover my hands when I&#x27;m driving.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money while I tested out the feasibility of wearing gloves to keep the sun off so I tried these.  They are good, but obviously meant for salon use. (the brand name is in pink and highly visible).  They are light weight so in this Texas heat they don&#x27;t cause me to overheat.  They serve their purpose for me.</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE!!! way too big for any size fingers. Get in the way of doing nails yourself and cause errors in applying polish. completely unable to use these because they get in the way. Now I can&#x27;t return them because the return period ended. Not happy amazon!!</li>
    <li> Bought these for my friend in the nail business, and she was so happy with them.</li>
    <li> great idea to avoid the early aging of your hands and dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;good quality.&lt;br /&gt;easy to use. i like it :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only met 3 people in my life who have smaller hands than me and this was pretty tight on me</li>
    <li> fingers are odd lengths so some are too short and some are too long - its not just me - my friends have tried them on and they are all odd lengths as well.  I bet if I cut the long fingers it would be better.</li>
    <li> If you do your nails frequently this is a must have I am nearly 60 and can&#x27;t afford any more damage to my hands and this helps.</li>
    <li> These gloves were supposed to be free with the UV light for the nails.  I&#x27;m not sure if it was actually free or not.  It was confusing how they broke it all down.  The gloves are okay, and I do use them when I do my nails.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good does the job. I prefer using sunscreen but friends like using it and it&#x27;s easy for them. They like it. Does what its supposed to.</li>
    <li> These were exactly as described.  I have small hands and would have to roll up the fingers to keep off my nails. Very hard for me to use because I do my own gel nails.  I guess I could have cut off the fingers a little, but did mnot try this.  Probably would work fine if you have someone else do your nails. I think it probably is a good idea to use these type of gloves for protection.</li>
    <li> After reading all the other reviews, I thought the lamp wouldn&#x27;t work, but it did. the lights were packaged carefully and everything. It has the timer which is nice. I used it with Harmony gelish nail polish and it worked just fine.</li>
    <li> These gloves feel  really smooth and silky, but my only concern for others is that they might be a bit too small. I consider myself to have a smaller frame (not super skinny, but about average) and these glove fit pretty snug. So if you have large arms or chubby hands, these may not be the best bet for you..just a word of precaution. Also, I get these are to protect against UV, but the tips of the fingers and nail beds are, of course, still exposed. I guess it&#x27;s good that it protects the rest of the hands and wrists. Overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
    <li> The past two months, I have used USpicy Anti-UV Gloves for UV Light / Lamp / Nail Dryer &amp; LED UV Nail Dryer Curing every 7 to 9 days while drying my fingernails under my &amp;#34;Superior&amp;#34; Nail Dryer.  The gloves are well made and durable.  I am very pleased with this item.</li>
    <li> I really like these protective gloves. I think it is important to protect our skin on our hands from the UV lights. I have had my nails done for many many years and have asked many nail techs about the damaging effects of the lights. I was always told there is nothing to worry about. I knew there was! I would not sit under the dryer lights. I was happy to get a pair of these gloves. I love the feel of these gloves on my skin, they feel very nice. I have very long fingers and have to pull the gloves up all the way, and make sure they stay pulled on all the way. I have concerns that anyone with short fingers will have problems with the gloves. They may have to cut the fingers off.</li>
    <li> I like these gloves. I think the more I can protect my hands from harmful uv exposure the better. They are ok, its not like they are unique in any way, it&#x27;s just a pair of polyester blend gloves with the fingertips cut off. They fit my hands and fingers fine except for the pinky which is a bit too long. No problem, I just fold it a little bit and everything is fine.</li>
    <li> The finger holes are small, you&#x27;d definitely have to put the gloves on before you do your nails or you&#x27;ll mess them up</li>
    <li> I use these about twice a month when I get my nails done.  They are very useful, though I&#x27;m not an expert on the science behind them.</li>
    <li> These gloves are a great idea and work great with the USpicy UV lamp I purchased. They only allow my fingertips to show through so my whole hand is protected from the UV lamp. This is useful because I can see using these often as I do my nails often,</li>
    <li> These are helpful when I want to do my nails. These glove fingers are too long for my short fingers, but all i have to do it just fold the fingers of the gloves back. no problem!</li>
    <li> I have not used the gloves at this point.  I bought them to have on hand in case I have a customer with a concern of UV Exposure. None has had that concern as yet.</li>
    <li> Was exactly what I wanted. Very easy set up. Now I never have to go to the nail salon again!</li>
    <li> The gloves do cover my hand -- but they are too long -- I have small fingers also, so I had to fold them up on each finger, or&lt;br /&gt;they would cover the fingers also.  Should by sized by small, medium, and large.  One size does NOT fit all.............</li>
    <li> the theory is good, tried them the material in the fingers kept sliding while nails were being painted haven&#x27;t worn them since</li>
    <li> I really like like them because they are large and it cover your entire hand and further more. Does not get in your way while painting your nails. I must have.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo37SY05C2I187O]]Ladies just love the beautiful high gloss nail gels on their fingernails. These polishes are UV cured and these gloves help to protect your hands from overexposure to UV light over a long period of time. They are lightweight micro-fabric polyester that blocks 98 % of the UV rays that cure your nails. It helps to keep your hands, wrists and arms protected and only the tips of your fingers and your nails are exposed. We believe that is better to be safe than sorry. My wife has always protected her skin from the harmful effects of the UV rays from the sun and she feels that she should also protect her hands while curing the gel polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One size fits all and they are easy to put on and remove. I have attached a short video of the gloves in action for your information. This is just good insurance to protect your hands and it is well worth the added effort to use these gloves. This is a very good product and we rated it a five star product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied with a sample of the gloves for test and evaluation and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.</li>
    <li> These gloves definitely disappointed.  They slide down on the fingers and with wet nails it can get tricky to keep pushing them up.  I feel like buying this product was a waste of money. I wish I could say differently but it is what it is.</li>
    <li> Fingers are a bit long, but served it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> Thumbs are long. If you have short fingers you will have to roll or cut it to avoid touching your nails.</li>
    <li> I use the shellac at home set every week or so and the gloves are great for added protection.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> for the price these are great protective gloves. They fit good on average size hands. Not sure how they do on large hands.</li>
    <li> I cannot wait until I use these gloves with my home manicure. I want to protect my hands from uv rays. Safety is a great concern for me.</li>
    <li> This gloves serve as a good block against the UV rays. There a little long on the fingers I had to cut them to fit my finger. You can feel the heat for the UV lamp with the gloves on although my hand or never in the lamp more than minute, minute and half at a time.</li>
    <li> Item does what it says! Bought them to protect my hands I do my own gel about every three weeks</li>
    <li> These gloves fit really well on me. They leave just the right amount of space for my nails whilst keeping my fingers, hands and lower arms covered. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> SHIPPING WAS GOOD&lt;br /&gt;ALL I KNOW IS I LOVE AND ENJOY FREE THINGS&lt;br /&gt;ALTHOUGH I DO NOT PERSONALLY USE THE PRODUCT MY WIFE&lt;br /&gt;DOES AND NO COMPLAINTS JUST HUGS AND KISSES&lt;br /&gt;BROWNIE POINTS GUYS.</li>
