<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff really works. I have just a couple areas at my temples that need covering when I pull my hair back and this product does the job. I would prefer it in a lighter shade. When I order more I will look for a lighter shade to blend with my highlights.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome for thinning hair. I use it everyday . (Have been for 2 years!) I cannot go out of the house without it. Try it once and you will apply it before you style every time!</li>
    <li> I love this product but the colors are deceiving. Having dark hair I ordered the brunette which is almost black. Now I use the blonde which is still quite dark but does what I want it to do. I didnt like the brush at all, but luckily I had a makeup  brush which works great. The product last a long time and stays on until u wash it out. It does itch once in awhile but all in all I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> The product packaging had previously been opened and then sealed with a piece of wide tape.  The packaging also appeared to be old.  The actual product appears to be unopened and unused, otherwise I would return.</li>
    <li> Excellent coverage. Looks so natural, no one can tell. Blends in so well with my highlighted hair.  3rd purchase of this great product :)</li>
    <li> The color is a little dark for me.  I have trouble spreading it.  It doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as the powders that you shake on.</li>
    <li> It works! I ordered the one for blond hair and I thought it was a little dark for very light blond, but when I re-colored, it was great!  I didn&#x27;t find it messy at all; you only need to put the powder on the very bottom of the brush.  You have to experiment with your own method, but I&#x27;m happy to say it actually does work!  Good for my self-confidence when going out.  Thanks Joan!</li>
    <li> When I started growing out my blonde highlights, my dark brown roots showed a lot of unwanted scalp wherever it was parted. I heard that Brown could be too dark so I ordered Blonde &amp; it&#x27;s versatile enough to take care of blonde, brown, and salt &amp; pepper hair. It mutes the shine &amp; dulls the demarkation btwn hair &amp; scalp. I like that it comes with an included brush &amp; it&#x27;s very easy to apply (if a tad cumbersome when covering several sections such as temples &amp; sides).     I dislike the scent of this powder but other than that it&#x27;s an excellent solution to scalp-show, especially when taking flash pictures. It wears until you wash it off &amp; doesn&#x27;t flake off everywhere.</li>
    <li> I love this product--and I&#x27;ve tried many others.  The powder for this shade is suited to darker blondes and those who who have extremely light brown hair.  If you are a true, light blonde, opt for the powder with that name.  The blonde powder has no red tones, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush provided will help you separate your hair to &#x27;paint&#x27; the powder in the specific spots you choose.  If you have very large areas to cover, buy a soft bristled brush and use that instead.  A hair stylist suggested this for someone with extreme hair loss and it worked quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This powder is superior to others in that, it will not wear off until you wash it out.  It doesn&#x27;t shed, flake, crack, drip, etc.  It stays put. It won&#x27;t appear on your clothes nor, pillow. I use it on both scalp and roots.  For the scalp, it provides a shadowy coverage; you just don&#x27;t see scalp anymore.  (By buying the right color, it blends into the rest of your hair color.) For the roots, there&#x27;s just enough coverage to not see defined lines of color versus incoming gray.  (Of course, if you are long overdue for color or, trying to grow out your hair, this product won&#x27;t do.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience is that I need to re-order only a few times per year.  Unless your scalp has very little hair, this will probably be sufficient for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended Great Hair Day to others and they are very pleased with it.  When a hair stylist suggested another product, I researched it and discovered that, if caught in the rain or, when sweating, it would actually drip off the scalp.  No thank you!  I will stick with this one.</li>
    <li> I have grey hair and I thought the day blonde would work. It is a little dark. SOmehow there should be someway to &amp;#34;see&amp;#34; the color better.  I am going to pass this off to a friend so it may not be a total loss.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this as it does hide my scalp and doesn&#x27;t come off even if a perspire.  I even like the fragrance of the powder when I apply it.</li>
    <li> Adequate cover/  Would have been better if I got a darker color.  My hair is dark brown.  Blonde was the wrong color for me.</li>
    <li> This product is very hard to use on yourself even with a mirror.  The powder doesn&#x27;t cover easily and I think the blonde is very dark.  However, I&#x27;m still using it ever hopefull that it will get easier and cover better.</li>
    <li> This time the product does not live up to what it used to be. Doesn&#x27;t cover the way it did. Has the formula changed? Not pleased at all.</li>
    <li> Amazing product with amazing results.  I am in my early 30s and have a cowlick on the back of my head that makes some of my scalp show.  I have dark brown hair and got the blonde color, and it blends in perfectly.  No more scalp showing.  It&#x27;s truly amazing.  I have looked my whole adult life for something like this and finally found it.  I am so happy!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this, it literally changed my life. It&#x27;s very hard to be balding as a woman and I honestly don&#x27;t know what I would ever do without this Great Hair Day.  It works incredibly well.  I do wish they would make it unscented as I don&#x27;t like scented things and this is a little bit perfumy, but worth it.  The blonde shade is great for my light brown hair, perfect color.  It&#x27;s really more of a light brown.  I tried the pale blonde, and that one&#x27;s too light, but would be good for very pale blondes.  I just purchased the red for the times when I like to color my hair red, so the verdict&#x27;s not in on that one yet, but I think it should be great.  All in all, this product is magic to me and I feel so blessed to have found it.  Keep up the good work making this, but please take the scent out of it!</li>
    <li> This met my expectations greatly!! My hair is very, very thin in the front. It covers the baldness which was caused from medications very good. You just need to match the color that blends with you hair. GREAT PRODUCT! I highly recommend it for people with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I ORDERED BLOND POWDER THRU AMAZON. IT IS SO DARK THAT I CANNOT USE IT. I SENT YOU AN EMAIL COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT AND I DIDNT GET AN ANSWER.  I NEED TO GET MY MONEY BACK.[[ASIN:B004Y0FKNE Joan Rivers Beauty Great Hair Day Fill in Powder-Blonde]]</li>
    <li> I have thinning areas on the top of my head.  This product is awesome.  I could not be without it.  Lasts until you wash it out with no transfer of color.  Great for the brows too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product really not knowing how it would do I had never used anything like this before but I was at the end of my rope.  My hair was thinning and I really did not want to go to a wig.  So, I took a chance and ordered it, I had to get used to it, it can be messy but now I have it down to a science and I can apply it very quickly.</li>
    <li> This product works very well for me. Yes, it&#x27;s a powder therefore it can be a bit messy, but the brush application is much easier to use than many \\&quot;shaker bottles\\&quot; and sprays I&#x27;ve used in the past.  And it stays on great so I rarely need to touch up.</li>
    <li> The brush came apart with the first use ( it could be glued together).  However the bristles continue to fall out.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like this product after using it for a short time. I have had hormone issues and have really noticed some thinning around the front of my hair.  So, I wanted to try something that might help until I get the issue (hopefully) under control. Here are a few things I noticed and I have also seen others comment in their reviews:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have light brown/blonde hair so I was not sure what product to get.  The Blonde is definitely for BROWN hair.  It is dark and it is not something I would use as a blonde at all. The picture is really close to the real color of the powder you will receive.  So, if you have darker roots like me, it works great.  Especially since I get my hair highlighted and the places where I use the product the most are at the root.  However, I will probably buy the light blonde as well so that I have it when I do highlight my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, as many other reviewers mentioned, I am not a big fan of this brush.  When I use it I definitely make sure to massage my scalp and rub in the product because it likes to deposit a big gob of it in one place if you aren&#x27;t careful.  I saw another review where they recommended Claudia Stevens Brush so I will probably buy this product too because it is much much cheaper and if the product isn&#x27;t any good at least I have the brush!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review again later after I have used this product longer and try Claudia Stevens!</li>
    <li> This product does a great job of covering thin spots on the scalp.  I would recommend this product.  Just use it sparingly to get the effect you want.</li>
    <li> Really does work to hide your thinning hair.  My sister put me on to it.  Only have to reapply after shampooing.  Although I have brown hair I used blonde.  Hope you continue to carry it.</li>
    <li> This product makes any bad hair day into a great hair day. I use it to cover thin areas and collick.</li>
    <li> This product works well for me, I would recommend it for anyone with thinning hair or bald areas on your scalp.</li>
    <li> Joan Rivers Great Hair Day brings back the look of having a full head of hair. I&#x27;m thinning on top and this stays in place even during high temperatures. I would recommend this product to any one. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with the Joan Rivers hair product. It made the scalp look like dirt was on it. I would say to save your money.</li>
    <li> The blonde shade works perfectly on my medium brown hair. I still can&#x27;t believe how well it fills in my thinning hair to make it look thicker.</li>
    <li> It hides that thin spot that I am so self-conscious about.  It stays put and doesn&#x27;t get on clothes or my pillow.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent item to use on your hair, not only does it help you to look like you have more hair but it also help you cover the gray between coloring.  LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works fantastic! Has stay-put power, lasts all day! Professional quality brush included. Excellent product I should have tried years ago.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to see such a dark color when I chose blonde,..it&#x27;s actually brown. I tried to dab lightly but now my roots were very dark, not blonde.</li>
    <li> Quick and easy to use!It produces the right covering/coloring....I use it every single day. My sister, Bernie, introduced me to the product; and, then when I used it up, I purchased it again.</li>
    <li> I have a scar on my head and this covers it.  Such a relief to have since my head injury!</li>
    <li> I Love this product - I use it almost every day - either to fill in thin spots or to cover the roots between colorings.  I highly recommend it.  You can apply it with precision and it is not messy.  It lasts all day and seems to make the hair much fuller.</li>
    <li> This was a product I ordered for my mother.  I have ordered it for myself and friends and we all love it!!  Great for anyone who has thinning hair and doesn&#x27;t want a mess to deal with.  Doesn&#x27;t shed or fall out.  Lasts until hair is washed.  Merely fill in the part (or in my mother&#x27;s case most of the front of her head).  It immediately looks like you have lots of hair just by covering the scalp. ...</li>
    <li> Glad I bought this product.  Pricy for the small amount you get but i think it will last a while and works really well.</li>
    <li> Great coverage and easily applies and blends with my natural hair.  It does not come off during the day until I wash my hair.</li>
    <li> If you have thinning hair - this is a great product to add a look of thickness!  I use it everyday.  Blonde is good for medium to dark blonde hair color.  Lasts all day without reapplication.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says it does. The Blonde works well for me. I have medium brown hair. I would recommend it without hesitation. It does not disappoint.</li>
    <li> It makes all the difference in how thick my hair looks.  I have thin hair and wear a hairpiece on top of crown and I&lt;br /&gt;can make my hair appear thicker on sides and back.  I love this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you were to see my hair when I first wash it before the great hair day is on scalp and see the finished product of&lt;br /&gt;hair fixed and how thick it looks you wouldn&#x27;t believe I was the same person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you can never run out of Great Hair Day Blonde, I HAVE TO HAVE IT!!</li>
    <li> This product works great and I am so pleased to have found something like this to help my hair to look thicker and not see any scalp.</li>
    <li> This does a good job of hiding those thinning areas that make us look older.  The only negative I can say about this is there is a lot of the product that is wasted.  A better brush would prevent this as well as prevent the mess that occurs when the powder falls all over your counter.</li>
    <li> Been using Great Hair Day for years and cannot live without it.  Makes hair look thicker, especially in the front.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great!!!!!!!  I&#x27;ve used it for 2 yrs.For a person that hair is thinning it is a wonderful product. As long as available I will use it.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s hair got a little thinner when our son was born and she was really upset that she had thin hair.  She found this stuff and it worked like a champ and helped to restore her confidence.  Looks matter to women and I&#x27;m not even going to joke around about that.  She ran out of her Great Hair Day about a year ago and I ordered two of these for her and accidentally chose \\&quot;blonde.\\&quot;  She was almost ready to cry when she opened the box (because I was trying to surprise her) and it said blonde.  She opened it up and noticed it was much darker than she anticipated and fell in love with it.  Now all she wants is the blonde.  This product will work for brunettes just fine.  My wife can vouch for that. I&#x27;m not sure how much variation there is between how long these last but just one of these will last my wife six months.</li>
    <li> My sister-in-law recommended this product to me.  It&#x27;s wonderful!  It lives up to every claim!  Fortunately, she showed me the &amp;#34;Blonde&amp;#34; is actually perfect for brown hair.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It covers up my scalp and gives the illusion of having thicker hair.  I can even go longer between colorings because I can cover up my roots for a while longer.  I just wish it was not so expensive.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for thinning hair. I buy this for my mother who has very very thin hair at the front of her scalp. She has been uding this for years and no one knows she has that much hair loss. Product stays on until you wash it out. Great product. Could not be without it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff to hide gray roots and bald spots.  I have been using it for several years now and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 55 and menopause has  caused hair loss, it&#x27;s embarrassing when the wind blows and you can see where you&lt;br /&gt;have lost hair. This product saves you, easy to apply and your hair looks thicker and your hair part  no longer looks like&lt;br /&gt;race track!</li>
    <li> I use the blonde powder with the Claudia Stevens brush. I&#x27;ll stick with Claudia Stevens since it&#x27;s so much cheaper and works just as well but with a better brush.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on the advice of my hairdresser. I am &amp;#34;blond&amp;#34; with her help, but by the third week my white roots are showing. This touch up blends in perfectly and disguises my old-lady hair! At first I thought it was too dark (I ordered the blond color) but it blends in and looks entirely natural. Much better than the waxy lipstick-style root touch ups. So much more natural.</li>
    <li> this product is awesome - it has made me regain my confidence.  although i have medium brown to dark brown hair, i use the blonde and it matches perfectly.  the only gripe i have about this is it makes my scalp itch and it is messy and gets all over the place.  i use a towel to cover the sink to avoid that problem, and use a medium blush brush instead of the brush provided, as it helps get more coverage.  i couldn&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
    <li> This product is great ... it hides those shiny, thin scalp spots and does, indeed, make your hair look thicker.  I would advise buying a shade lighter than your own hair color, especially if your hair is dark.</li>
    <li> I have a terrible problem with thin hair and I swear by this product!! It completely hides my problem and looks great!!! Thank you Joan Rivers!!!!</li>
    <li> What a rip off! If you are blond DON&#x27;T DO IT!! AND it will cost you more than they charged you for the product to return!! RIP OFF BIG TIME!</li>
    <li> This is a great. The blonde shade is a little dark but works great. Covers my white hair and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says it will and almost anyone can use it with easy and be assured they look better with it than without.  Try it, you will look as if you have more hair while gaining comfidence that your lookin&#x27; good.[[ASIN:B004Y0FKNE Joan Rivers Great Hair Day Blonde]]</li>
    <li> I have been using the JR  great hair fill in , for 2 years...it&#x27;s perfect for me..my hair is blond but I like it darker around my face...so this does the trick for me..THANK YOU JOAN..!!!</li>
    <li> Great for brown hair can not live without it, best on market and I&#x27;ve tried a lot don&#x27;t hesitate get it</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a year and wouldn&#x27;t live without it, I love it! I have a little thinning by my part and this covers it up perfectly. The only trouble is a slight itch, which I only notice a couple times a day, so it isn&#x27;t much of a problem. I have medium brown hair which is turning to salt and pepper, and the blond is perfect.</li>
    <li> Was surprised to be so pleased with this product  -it blends well with my brown hair, looks very natural and doesn&#x27;t wear off like until washed.</li>
    <li> My hormone related hair loss was starting to take a toll on my self esteem.&lt;br /&gt;This product gave me my life back and I don&#x27;t know what I would without it. I always make sure I have 2 on hand. I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
    <li> I am 47 years old and have coarse but thinning dark brown hair.  With a blow dryier and a big round brush I am able to make my bobbed hair look thick EXCEPT for those areas on either side of my widows peak and along my part where I can see the hairs growing out of my scalp (hairs meaning a few).  I use the Great Hair day Blonde on my scalp in these areas.  Perfect!  It is plenty dark enough,  I pat pat pat it on as I move my party around and it takes away from my scalp peeking through.Heck, I wear make-up to make my complection look younger, why not my scalp?</li>
    <li> I like that this \\&quot;hair powder\\&quot; came in a compact and less messy. It came in a VERY timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleased with the experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because a friend, who bought the same thing on line, advised me, I ordered the \\&quot;Blonde\\&quot; instead of the DARKER&lt;br /&gt;color which I normally would have done, and the \\&quot;Blonde\\&quot; blended in perfectly with my darker brown hair. One would&lt;br /&gt;never know it was \\&quot;blonde\\&quot; on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would advise anyone with thinning hair and \\&quot;shiny spots\\&quot; on the scalp to use this product. It definitely makes&lt;br /&gt;your hair look thicker.</li>
    <li> Love the product hides the scalp. Looks like I have full set of hair.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair &amp;amp; this product works great.  I no longer see my scalp when I look in the mirror.  I would recommend this product to anyone with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> The color is too dark for me, and I have auburn hair - I cannot see how this is going to work for blonde hair. It does help hide my shiny scalp from showing through my thinning hair, but be careful with application, otherwise you might end up looking splotchy.&lt;br /&gt;It might just be than I&#x27;m crap at applying it. Perhaps with more patience you&#x27;ll have more luck.</li>
    <li> I love this product, and cannot do without it!!!  My hair is thin on top, which was always an embarrassment to me.&lt;br /&gt;I have dark blonde hair, so the blonde is perfect for me.  Since I have been using it for the past 2 years, I have gotten&lt;br /&gt;several of my friends to try it, and they love it too!  The blonde seems very dark, but when you blend it in, it works&lt;br /&gt;perfectly.  It stays in your hair until you shampoo it out.  It does not rub off, or come off in the rain, or the pool. I can only&lt;br /&gt;hope that they never quit making this product.  The product lasts about a year.  They only thing I don&#x27;t care for is the&lt;br /&gt;brush.  It wears out halfway through the product.  I would like the option to purchase extra brushes.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly as it says, is easy to use, and makes a huge difference in the appearance of hair thickness at the scalp. You have to use it a couple of times to know how much of it you need, but it&#x27;s very easy to work with. I was totally amazed at how well this worked on pale blonde, highlighted hair because it looked like it would be way too dark. But I&#x27;ve got to say, It blended perfectly and is virtually undetectable. It makes your hair look great in any light and is completely natural. I would recommend this to anyone who has thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I liked this color better than the Salt &amp; Pepper or Brunette, but it is still a little too dark for my hair.</li>
    <li> Thank you Joan, and Amazon for stocking this color, since everyone else is out!  LOL&lt;br /&gt;I just tried it today and I must say that it will require some finesse and a learned technique on my part, but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, in that it nicely camouflages bare or sparse scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I think I may also buy another brush (like a mini kabuki) which will work much better than the one provided in the kit.</li>
    <li> I read many of the other reviews about what shade to pick first, so I went with the blonde even though I am a medium brunette.  It was a perfect match.  I have been using it regularly to help hide the natural part in my hairline, and it looks great.  Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I am very thankful for this product.  It covers very well and stays on for a long time.  I am very pleased with the results..</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend of mine who is bothered by thinning hair.  She is overjoyed by how natural the product looks and how much thicker her hair looks.  She often breaks this powder out of her handbag to show people how well it works.  One thing to beware of...my friend is a medium brunette, not a blonde.  Based on other reviews, I went for a lighter color and I was not steered wrong.  Go for a shade lighter than your hair color.</li>
    <li> I really love this product!! It has made my hair look so much thicker and I can finally wear it down for a change.  I usually wear it up, because I can camoflage the thin areas better.  I originally bought the brunette, because I have medium brown hair, but it really was too dark and after reading other&#x27;s reviews purchased the blonde which realy is more like a medium brown.  That would be my only complaint, that the colors are a little confusing.  Other than that I LOVE IT!!  Try it if your hair is thin!!!! I doubt you will be sorry!!</li>
    <li> I would say depending on how much you still have on top, it&#x27;s a good buy better than without it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter to hide her loss of pigment(piebald). It worked so well for her that I decided to try it for my gray roots - it works! I can put off root touchups for a couple of weeks. I have dark auburn hair but bought the blonde shade and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> product covers well, advertises it will not transfer this is untrue very disapointed in this can purchase cheaper product that covers just as well. wanted this because of the claim of no transfer to fabric or hands. know that it does transfer</li>
    <li> Great product  for  quick  cover up  for  special  occasions  or  just  everday usage. Blonde  color  works excellent  on dark brown hair too, price and shipping is extremely  resonable on Amazon, have  not  found it this cheap  ANYWHERE, so I  stocked up! Very  Quick  delivery too!</li>
    <li> When I took this product with me to show to my hair dresser I wanted her opinion.  She applied it to my scalp after washing and styling my hair.  The results were amazing.  The ease of application and the packaging make this product a winner.  My hair dresser is now recommending it to her customers.</li>
    <li> I am writing this review for people who need to see reviews before purchasing, such as myself. This product is great. It covers the part so well and looks so natural. I love it. I got it to add more volume and lessen the appearance of white scalp. If you are on the fence about it, def purchase. I got blonde but have dark brown hair. It works great but next time I may get brunette and see how that works.</li>
    <li> Not what I thought. I thought it was to color roots between colorings, it was meant for thinning hair to apply to scalp.</li>
    <li> It covered very well for my wife&#x27;s thinning hair.  She uses it often and ordered another color when she changed hers.</li>
    <li> Great product, very little time to get accustomed to using it correctly.  For me this product has made me more confident in how my thinning hair appears.</li>
    <li> I think it is a great product, but it is much too dark for blond hair.  I have medium blond hair with blond highlights and light brown low lights and i find it much too dark for me.  If it was a lighter color, it would be wonderful.</li>
    <li> The color, Blonde, was much too dark for my hair. I will not use the product. The company needs to make a lighter color.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00DRFGKCM Joan Rivers Great Hair Day Fill-In Powder - Blonde]]I am a brunette that has skunk stripes, uneven ones, in front. I am also going grey now in my widow&#x27;s peak. This makes me look pretty bad as my hair is very fine and silky, so the white/grey hairs make me look weird, like there is no hair there. Whenever I do a touch-up, I look 10x better and a lot younger. I just don&#x27;t look good with the greys like some of my friends. So since my hair grows rather fast, I have to dye my roots at least every 2 weeks to cover a lot of grey skunk stripes. My mom noticed one day when we were out eating my skunk stripe (I was just too tired during that time period to keep up on the root touch-ups) and she pushed this Joan River&#x27;s Blonde Hair powder on me. I did not want to try it, but I relented under pressure and my mom ordered it for me. I used it and it blends the greys away perfected. You can&#x27;t even tell! I can be lazy and go a month without touching up my roots...as long as I have this powder (I use the blonde one, as my mom does as well). It&#x27;s AWESOME. I am hooked now. A little goes a long way, I have been using it over 6 months and no need to replace it yet (but then I have just the skunk stripes I cover). One word of advice: try to look where you put the powder on and rub it with your fingers, blend it, maybe apply 3 times or so this way. Last week, I was very, very tired and I just went crazy putting it on without my glasses or contacts on. I got it on my forehead and looked very funny. My coworkers were too polite to say anything but YE GODS when I went into the bathroom, I looked like I had a skin disease. Fortunately, I just rubbed it out easily with my bare hands. I don&#x27;t know how, but this stuff just sticks to hair...even when it rains. Even when I swear. GET IT. You won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/4/17 I am still using it everyday. Even when I had the flu a few months ago, I still used this. I feel like it helps me look younger. The shade really beefs up your hair, given a fuller head of hair illusion. I now use some dry shampoo or hair spray and put some volume. People now think I have a lot of hair. My boyfriend runs his fingers through my hair when we watch a movie and Joan Rivers Hair Powder NEVER comes off in his fingers. He doesn&#x27;t even know I use it.given a fuller head of hair illusion. I now use some dry shampoo or hair spray and put some volume. People now think I have a lot of hair. My boyfriend runs his fingers through my hair when we watch a movie and Joan Rivers Hair Powder NEVER comes off in his fingers. He doesn&#x27;t even know I use it.</li>
    <li> Love this product as I have lost hair due to medical conditions and it is very&lt;br /&gt;hard to go out in public.  This product gives me my confidence back again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish all the women who go through this could find this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the product was as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t ever stop carrying it.</li>
    <li> I have tried other powders you shake on, those are awful and make a mess, this goes right where you put it, no one knows your wearing it.</li>
    <li> I use this every time I wash my hair since my hair is thin, feels thicker, wonderful product. Glad more products are coming out like this.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.  Have two extra.  Covers just in the spots needed and it is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Is a really good a simple make up that stays till you wash your hair again.  The empty spaces that use to make me sad just desapears.... At least I do not see so much.  I really recomend it.</li>
    <li> I very reluctantly ordered this product.  I don&#x27;t want to have to use it.  Unfortunately, when I hit 40 my hair started to thin slightly right at the top front area of my hair.  I had always had nice, thick hair that I was very proud of.  What a bummer.  I visited dermatologists and various other physicians trying to find out what was wrong with me.  I quickly found out that (much to my surprise) thinning hair and hair loss is actually quite common in women.  Who knew?  Not I.  So, here I am 4 years later feeling slightly self-conscious when I go out due to my thinning hair.  Funny thing is, most people swear they cannot tell my hair is thinning, but I can.  After I point it out, some say they do see a little thinning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product sparingly to disguise my scalp showing through in the previously mentioned area where my hair has thinned (I probably have half the hair I used to have there.)  It works great!  I can look in the mirror again and not see this shiny, white scalp glaring at me through what is left of my hair.  It has really helped with my self esteem.  I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product.  It&#x27;s easy to apply, stays put for me, and looks great.  My hair color is a medium brown and the \\&quot;blonde\\&quot; works very well for me.  I really have found this to be a very helpful product so I totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I was skeptical when I ordered this product, but I have been very pleased with the result.  I ordered the dark blonde since that is my hair color, and it is perfect.  It really does fill in the gaps, just make sure that you blend it well.  Thanks, Joan,&lt;br /&gt;for a great product.</li>
    <li> I use this when I want to delay a touch-up of hair coloring.  It&#x27;s easy to apply.  Fun to use.</li>
    <li> I have used this to cover the balding spots on my scalp.  Here&#x27;s my thought on the product.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Does what it claims - covers the scalp and eliminate the shine so it&#x27;s harder to detect hair loss.  I&#x27;ve used it around family and friends and they were not aware I was using anything&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t stain pillow or hats - I&#x27;ve slept with it, wore hats with it and have not noticed any staining&lt;br /&gt;- Have sweated and swam with it without it streaking down my face - have been in pools with it and have not noticed any streaking. Seems to stay put until you wash it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s a little messy sometimes to apply, as it&#x27;s like taking the equivalent of an power eye shadow and dabbing it onto the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;- if you really examine your hairline super closely in the mirror, it&#x27;s obvious that this is not something that looks like hair, but is a scalp cover-up&lt;br /&gt;- I recommend not wearing this overnight as I believe it will cause you to lose more hair.  I was doing keeping this product on overnight and sometimes for two days between washes for a while and I started noticing a lot more hair falling out and my hair loss accelerating,  Not sure if it&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t allow your scalp to \\&quot;breathe\\&quot;, but once I stopped doing that, my hair fell out a lot less.  I also found that by night, my scalp becomes very itchy and any attempt to scratch my scalp will cause the powder to smear all over my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think it&#x27;s definitely worth using to help cover up the scalp. I&#x27;ve also tried XFusion and find that XFusion is easier and faster in covering up the spots, however I have not tested xFusion in sweaty/rainy/swimming situations.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Mother who has gray hair.  It was so-so.  Her hair color is better natural. It is great for filling in eyebrows.</li>
    <li> This really does work to camoflage bare areas on scalp.  The negative is the gritiness you feel on your scalp.  It also does take a little time to apply so espect that.  Consequently, it is very good for occasional use, not so great for daily living.</li>
    <li> This is the best product.  I have &amp;#34;see thru hair&amp;#34; and using this product makes it look like I have a ton of hair, I have been using this for about a year and a half and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> It works great&lt;br /&gt;Nice product, no mess, easy application.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for both men and women&lt;br /&gt;Great great great great</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product! Works exactly as described! I have light brown hair and the Blonde color matches perfectly. I have read some reviews that mentioned a scent but I haven&#x27;t noticed one.  It stays on without fading or wearing off yet washes out when you shampoo. If you are looking for something that colors the grey and fills in areas, this is the product for you! Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I hope this is never discontinued. Great product. I have referred this product to others and they love it to.</li>
    <li> My friend told me about this product a year ago and I haven&#x27;t been able to live without it since! The top front of my hair is thinning (I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s) and I was embarrassed to go out in public because I always had beautiful, thick hair. This product covers the scalp area so that it&#x27;s not noticeable. I have light blonde hair, so I use the light blond and it&#x27;s perfect. (My friend has brown hair, but she uses the red because it matches better - the brown is too dark for her.) And I never noticed that it has a scent and I don&#x27;t find it messy at all. I have no problems with it, it&#x27;s so easy to apply. It just takes a minute to apply and the brush it comes with is perfect. The color doesn&#x27;t run or rub off on my pillow, it&#x27;s just perfect! One unit lasts a whole year for me, so you can&#x27;t beat that! Thank you Joan for creating this wonderful product and giving me back my confidence. Buy with confidence, you will love it if you have thinning hair!</li>
    <li> I was extremely disappointed with this product.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to stick to my scalp or hair at all.  And the brush is of pretty poor quality.  You are much better off with TOPPIK fibers.</li>
    <li> Waste of time and money.  Feels awful and is messy.  For me it didn&#x27;t work or look anything like it did on the commercial.  Yuck!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It gives me confidence that I didn&#x27;t have before.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  I have never used the application brush.  I use my index finger and apply it that way.  It gives me better control where it goes. I always have a couple of them as back up. I gave one to my Mom since she gave me the thinning hair gene.  She loves it as well.</li>
    <li> I really like joan rivers , \\&quot;great hair day\\&quot;  However for the past two times I&#x27;ve ordered it I have gotten the wrong color in the right container.  The container says blonde but the color of the powder is brown.  I even tried a little in my hair to see if the color was off and it surely was.  The blonde looks like a golden color.  I give up !!!</li>
    <li> This product was suppose to be a blonde powder to cover thinning areas or gray hair.  It was clearly as brown as the brunette product that I already own.  I tried the product to see how it would work on my gray hair, the area that I used it on was actually more obvious than the actual gray hair that I was trying to cover up.  I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> First compact lasted over 1 1/2 years!  Love that her colors have no red in them.  Very natural looking matte brown, works well on my thinning medium blonde hair.  Does seem to make it seem fuller though I&#x27;m not too thin ...yet! (50 yrs old)  Highly reccomend this product!!!  Oh, and unlike some other posters here I find the smell pleasant/clean smelling.</li>
    <li> It seams like a good product, but I got the wrong color.  It does cover the gray very well. Try it you will love.</li>
    <li> It is the perfect &amp;#34;cover up&amp;#34; for thinning hair.....the best invention yet (for hair!) I use it every time I shampoo my hair.</li>
    <li> Best product for hair.  Have told all my friends and they have purchased and are very satisfied. Thanks for the product.</li>
    <li> I had a long while ago seen a commercial that Joan Rivers had on television.  I have had thinning hair in the front for a long time - I tried this product and love it - The way it works is that it adds definition.  Even if someone is standing right over me and looks at my head, they don&#x27;t realize that my hair is so thin.  If anyone out there has the same problem with thinning hair - I STRONGLY recommend purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> when I started loosing my hair in spot&#x27;s due to thyroid condition I was devastated! I  am normally a very friendly outgoing person. Didn&#x27;t want people staring and  Didn&#x27;t even want to leave my house...  I found this product quite by accident, and thought &amp;#34;well it&#x27;s got to be better than a hat or a wig or hiding in my house&amp;#34;...  Didn&#x27;t even imagine it would work as well as it has!  I&#x27;m so thankful!!!!  I order this again and again. Thank you from the bottom of my soul.  The price here is reasonable and shipping is fast too!!!</li>
    <li> Thank you Joan, for this product. I wish I would have ordered it a long time ago. It works great! On QVC they offered more colors. I only had 3 choices when I ordered here. I would like a shade just a bit lighter. But this product is exactly what I have needed for a couple of years. Thank you again. I will order it again!</li>
    <li> The best product on the market.  It covers thin areas of the scalp and I would recommend to anyone who has thinness of hair to cover shiny scalp areas.  I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Dark Brown Hair.  Thin because I am 70.  My roots aren&#x27;t a problem, my scalp showing is a problem.  This makes such a difference and is even easy for me to apply by myself at the back/crown of my head.  A very small brush lets you apply it to eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I thought it was difficult to tell what color to order from the picture.  Having light brown hair with some highlights I ordered the Blonde which seemed to match the most.  It may be a little too light for me.  However, the product goes on easily and is not detectable.  It probably is meant for people with more thinning than I currently have.  All in all I am not sorry for the order and am using it.</li>
    <li> The blonde was not for blondes!!  I had to choose the light blonde or the blonde and since I am a darker natural blonde, I went with blonde. It looked like I had ashes on my head.  Returned &amp; got my money back. Maybe if you dye your hair a darker shade of blonde and your brown roots are showing, this might match.</li>
    <li> Life changing product !! A powder that easily covers the GREY!! No sticky feeling and STAYS PUT until you wash your hair - will save me another week or two. Between color touch ups !&lt;br /&gt;making it 3 less salon visits a year !! Yeah !</li>
    <li> This product works as described and has a great gentle fragrance too.I love the packaging because it is written as if you are talking to Joan. Great marketing for an equally great product. Gets my highest recommendation!</li>
    <li> I have used several different colors of the Great Hair Day product with good results.  The compact and brush are so easy to take with you when you travel and take up no space in your drawer at home.  It makes thinning hair look much fuller and does not show or come off between washings.  Wish I&#x27;d had it 20 years ago.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend!  I have been using this product for years to cover up those fussy gray hairs in between colorings----it is definitely a product that I would not be without.  Stays on your hair and does not transfer onto pillows, hats etc.</li>
    <li> I choose this item because I was looking for a present. The item was just as it was described in picture. I would definitely recommend this item to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> The best thing made out there for hiding your gray growth between touch ups and it&#x27;s not a greasy lipstick tube of touchup color.  Its a powder &amp; brush and does an excellent job covering gray.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended I try this based on feedback from another client. This is a wonderful product and I don&#x27;t leave home without using it. Imitation products from local beauty supply shops are ok, but definitely inferior.  Thank you, Joan!</li>
    <li> I had used this product before and was very pleased.  The only problem I had with this was the color.  I ordered the blonde hue and it seemed darker then the one I had before.  But the coverage was amazing.  I showed my girlfriend how it worked and she ordered one of her own.</li>
    <li> As always, this product is a great help in covering hair thinning.  Tho I have dark brown hair, the blonde seems to work.  Stays on..</li>
    <li> For years, as a teacher of young children, I would hear remarks such as, &amp;#34;You have a bald spot&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;I can see your scalp.&amp;#34;  Now with great hair day I feel much more confident that hair looks even with no scalp showing.  Thank you Joan Rivers!</li>
    <li> This product seems to do the trick and cover bare spots. Stays put, even if you touch the area on your scalp where it was applied. I&#x27;m extremely frustrated by poor color labeling of the product! There are reviews of this product on multiple sites where people complain about this. Word to the reader: \\&quot;light blond\\&quot; is really blonde. \\&quot;Blonde\\&quot; is really brunette and \\&quot;brunette\\&quot; is really black. Now I have a $37 mistake on my hands, as do many others.  What a scam. Due to poor labeling..a fortune to be had by this manufacturer.  Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but I only gave it 3 stars because there was no selection for the light blonde.  I didn&#x27;t realize this, and ordered the &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; which is way too dark.  It is a great product, and I have used it for a couple of years.  Just be careful if your hair is any shade of light blonde, make sure you order that shade of great hair day.  The blonde is more for people with brunette to lighter brunette hair.  Again, a great product, and it does exactly what is says it will do!  There is a &amp;#34;light blonde&amp;#34; shade - it was just not offered here at this time!</li>
    <li> First found this product on QVC and paid twice the price for it. Was thrilled with the way it goes on and covers and wears so naturally and well.  I was thrilled to run across it on Amazon.  A very happy customer! I have thinning hair on top because of thyroid problems and this is a great way to cover the areas and it still looks natural.  What a confidence booster!</li>
    <li> The blonde was a little dark for my hair. Next I&#x27;ll try light blonde. I don&#x27;t know how to explain its effects. It didn&#x27;t REALLY cut the shine, but it made it LOOK like I had a bit more hair. Maybe the \\&quot;powdery-ness\\&quot; made my hair fluffier near the roots. It would be great for covering roots that have grown out in colored hair. I too found the fragrance somewhat unpleasant. Also, if I scratched my head, the powder came off on my fingers. Generally, however, it adhered to my scalp well.</li>
    <li> this is an ok product. it doesn&#x27;t go on as easy as i thought but it does cover the spots</li>
    <li> I have very thin, fine hair and my scalp is visable. The fill in makes my hair look thick! I am glad I followed the advice of others and got the blonde. Very happy to find a hair product that works!</li>
    <li> This does not transfer or come out until hair is washed. Use around crown to look like you have thick hair. I just love this item..I hope you never stop offering it..</li>
    <li> The product arrived as promised and it performs great.  Will buy again when needed  With having thinning hair from age and weight loss this product greatly improves the appearance of thicker, fuller hair and stays on till washed out.</li>
    <li> I love this product! For us gals with fine, thin hair, it does the trick. Friends and family all say that my hair actually looks thicker and fuller. Easy to use, washes out. I will continue to buy this product as long as it is available!</li>
    <li> Works great in cover small spots.  Blends nicely.  I don&#x27;t know if this will work in larger  spots to cover</li>
    <li> Read other Reviews and went the the Blonde as others stated it worked well on Brunette hair.  NO!!!  Way to light.  Wish I had of gone ahead and ordered the Brunette.  Otherwise seemed ok but can not use.</li>
    <li> My complaints are it takes so long to apply and the blonde color is no longer available at a reasonable price</li>
    <li> My sister and I love it. I hope this product stays available for years to come.  Baby boomers need it. Thanks Joan!!!!</li>
