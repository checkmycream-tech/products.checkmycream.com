      <li>It was exciting to have so many choices at the beginning, but not any more.</li>
      <li>and they are easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>The creamy consistency, and super pigmented colors are to die for!</li>
      <li>i am a huge fan of Shany products</li>

      <li>The case is light weight and can fit in all my purses.</li>

      <li>Wide range selection of nice stunning colors.</li>
      <li>the colors are very nice, theyre extremely shiny and pigmented as all shany colors are.</li>
      <li>This makes a really great gift for your special lady, or the little lady in your life.</li>
      <li>It was definitely worth the price</li>
      <li>I cant tell anything about the quality of the make up because it was a gift to someone that I rarely see and did not ask her.  </li>
      <li>it is the applicators never stay in place besides that the eye shadows are worth buying</li>
      <li>Regardless, this set is worth your money.</li>
      <li>You have many colors to choose from and its compact and easy to pact, while also being large enough to use.  </li>
      <li>She has used lots of makeup kits in the past and says this one is by far the BEST.</li>
      <li>Great price for what I call &amp;#34;practice makeup.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m really not sure about the quality, but My daughter loves it and that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
      <li>theyre fun to use and blend very well!</li>
      <li>But the shadow is beautiful, every color imaginable from subtle too bold, its creamy and blends very well.</li>
      <li>Color goes on exactly where you place it and stays (even through a shower, so get your oil based remover out)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> you will not be disappointed when you get your palette. the colors are highly pigmented and long lasting. i was so excited when it arrived. the tri-fold design is too cute and is great for travel. i love it! and you will too!</li>
    <li> this set is perfect !!  rich in colors, comes in a cute book like case.  different colors, use with a jumbo pencil and the colors last longer.  all night!</li>
    <li> Was very &amp;#34;grainy&amp;#34;.  Emphasizes wrinkles.</li>
    <li> this eyeshadow ensemble is terrific. the colors are vibrant and exhilirating. i love it. i have received so many compliments on the eyeshadow colors or how i have made my eyes compliment the outfit i am wearing. i have never been excited about makeup in general, however this eyeshadow makes you feel young, beautiful, and sexy.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for a teenager. The makeup selection is decent.  Lots of browns and purples and only a few greens and blues, but still leaves you with enough choices.  It arrived in good condition with nothing broken unlike other makeup kits I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon. The case itself is very nice and can be used to travel.  The only down side is it contains what is alleged to be a dangerous chemical: Titanium Dioxide (the whitening agent in many tooth pastes).  I&#x27;d prefer to not put this on my skin and wish I had known about this before purchasing.</li>
    <li> i am a huge fan of Shany products so i wasnt expecting for this product to be bad. the case is cute (besides the button part ripping off, no big deal) the colors are very nice, theyre extremely shiny and pigmented as all shany colors are. just a little too shiny for me but i make them work. theyre fun to use and blend very well!</li>
    <li> I purchased sets for My nieces and daughters to go along with their Christmas cash since adult kids are harder to buy for. all were very impressed witth quality. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive, nicely packaged and displayed in a variety of rainbow colors.  Was given as a Christmas gift for a young lady.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a pallet to play with lots of colors rather than just a small one color eyeshadow. I love honor has all the colors of the rainbow and some so you can blend and mix to coordinate with any and every outfit. The color also goes on VERY well like Mac quality. I am a medium tan (&amp;#34;light-skinned&amp;#34; some would say) and I don&#x27;t use primer and it goes on and stays great. Primer would probably make it even better I guess. I bought my own brushes to use though (I don&#x27;t use the ones included) very nice packaging. Great size to carry for travel and such. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Take it from a girl that wears Chanel, MAC, Dior, NARS... I was shocked at the amazingly high quality of Shany products when I first tried their eyeshadows. The creamy consistency, and super pigmented colors are to die for! Also, the variety of colors will surprise you. There are colors that I&#x27;ve never imagined. I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other Shany palettes and they are all amazing. I recommend their eyeshadow palettes to everyone-way before you hit the expensive brands, pls pls try this!</li>
    <li> Lot&#x27;s of different shades here to experiment with, and mix and match, folds up into a compact little package to slip in you purse</li>
    <li> Great price for what I call &amp;#34;practice makeup.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m really not sure about the quality, but My daughter loves it and that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
    <li> I give the eye shadow an A+++ because of the beautiful shades of eye shadow and this case is so unique, and it snaps closed.  You would just have to see it to believe how cool this case or makeup set is!!  My daughter and I both ordered it, and we love it!!!  The shades are gorgeous!!!!</li>
    <li> My 4 year old obliterated this pretty much the same day it came, so I didn&#x27;t get much mileage out of this product. I am planning to replace it immediately, because this is some awesome eyeshadow. The colors are pretty, and there&#x27;s a wide range to choose from. I woke at 4am yesterday to discover my child was a shimmery bronze-grey from head to toe. No, seriously, head to toe. The colors she chose blended together beautifully, and stayed put through 1.5 baths--I had to scrub to get all of it off and she&#x27;s still bronze-grey in places. This eyeshadow will last through your work day, your night out, quite possibly even a torrential rain. It does not survive a four year old, but it puts up a hell of a fight! 10/10 am definitely buying again.</li>
    <li> I cant tell anything about the quality of the make up because it was a gift to someone that I rarely see and did not ask her.  However, the price was really affordable and the packaging and presentation of the product gave the recipient of this gift a really nice impression.  It really looked good.  There is a ton of colors to choose from and the 6 applicators are very convenient.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this little set</li>
    <li> All the colors I ever wear are in this set from neutral to spring summer and night. I never use cream but I’m switching. The cream just glides on and stays.</li>
    <li> Okay so I have been seeing Shany products on here for over a year, this is my first purchase. The product arrived in tact, not a single shadow broken, not even any loose shadow dust. I work in a fast food restaurant, where some days it can exceed 95 degrees. My shadow stays in tact and beautiful all day. I even took an hour long nap today woke up still looking great! It goes without saying you should always use a primer, I use E.L.F costs about $4 and works great. The shadow wands they provide are terrible, I threw them away. But the shadow is beautiful, every color imaginable from subtle too bold, its creamy and blends very well. The shadow sizes are much larger than I expected as well. Awesome awesome product with an even greater price! I will only be purchasing Shany products from now on, and I can&#x27;t wait to tell my teenage sister about this stuff!</li>
    <li> Every color I need in one set.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for this set; it does not glide onto the eyelide even with primer on. The case is cool though.</li>
    <li> Nice set for the price. It&#x27;s fun to have such a wide variety of colors and it comes in a nice case. Would recommend to anyone who wants to spice up their eyeshadow collection without spending too much.</li>
    <li> So i ended up using only a few colors on this panel. It was exciting to have so many choices at the beginning, but not any more.</li>
    <li> I really love this item. Gonna have to invest more in this brand. The colors are really long lasting, lasts for the entire day. LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> 1.  The product came fully intact.  I have even traveled with it in checked luggage and it stayed intact as well.      2.  The case is cute and stylish.    3.  The color choices are excellent.  There is no need for additional colors...at least for me. :)    4.  The colors are concentrated and you only need a wee little bit if you want to go subtle.      5.  I took the applicators out as they kept falling out of their little spaces.  But truly you want to use brushes with this set to get the best effect.  The applicators are just a little bonus.    6.  KEEP the clear film that comes with the set.  This prevents the colors from integrating with one another.    I have a blast choosing from the choices of color and they are easy to apply.  Happy Make up!</li>
    <li> Umm, well I love the packaging and the large array of colors, but it takes a long time of application to get to my right color.</li>
    <li> Wide range selection of nice stunning colors. I&#x27;m not sure if my brushes are the culprit but the colors are not that pigmented to me. Regardless, this set is worth your money. Bought it to practice with my eyes and that I would do. :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because it was compact to use on vacations. I took it on my last vacation with me last week for the first time and I was right.  You have many colors to choose from and its compact and easy to pact, while also being large enough to use.  The only thing that I don&#x27;t care for are the applicators.  That is okay, because I have my own.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift but ended up keeping it for myself :). Nice colors and very nice case which attracted me so much. Very useful when travelling.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time, and absolutely love it. It&#x27;s the only eye shadow I use now. Great Pallete</li>
    <li> I was really excited to purchase this eyeshadow kit.  The colors looked really vibrant from the picture. When I finally received this I was somewhat disappointed.  First the case design is a bit clumsy and hard to manage. Next, the thin plastic protective overlays do nothing to protect the eyeshadows. Finally the shadows themselves don&#x27;t apply very well. The shadow pigments are a bit faint for my taste. I wear glasses, so they didn&#x27;t do much for the overall effect I was going for. The colors start off looking a bit chalky at first, but eventually settle to a pearly finish. On the upside, the eyeshadows don&#x27;t require a primer, and wears well throughout the day. No need for touch ups which is a major plus. In addition the product was shipped undamaged. Next time I will spend the money and purchase a more professional brand; something with a higher intensity pigmentation. Will I continue to use this particular eyeshadow palette?  Yes.  Will I ever buy this again once it runs out? Absolutely not.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a niece Christmas of 2012. When I got the &#x27;wish list&#x27; for Christmas 2013 this was on her list again. She loves the make up and I love the price.</li>
    <li> This set has some great colors, many metallics and is perfect as a complimentary set to my regular palette. (I need more neutrals with a matte finish) I love the case and it makes travel a snap. These shadows are highly pigmented as well.</li>
    <li> There are  so much color you cannot go wrong with this purchase. I would recommend it to everyone. You&#x27;ll get more bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> This set was a great buy for the price. You get so many colors to choose from, and a little product goes a long way. I just wish that I had payed closer attention to the description before buying because I did not realize that ALL of the colors would be shimmers. There are no matte colors in the set so be aware of this before you purchase. If you&#x27;re looking for a lot of shimmer options, this is a perfect buy.</li>
    <li> What a fabulous find! I am surprised at how beautiful these colors are and what a great deal I got. It is much larger than I thought it was. If you love experimenting with eye shadow, this is a must have. What else can I say, I love it!</li>
    <li> I love the assortment and the selection! It was definitely worth the price I paid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not crazy about the brushes that came with it, but I have my own that I have been using.</li>
    <li> I bought this color set because of the brilliant color scheme and I was not disappointed.  I use it with Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer and the colors stay on and vibrant all day.</li>
    <li> omg i love this the way it is package is so cute it comes in a pouch that is so easy to fold up and put in your purse it you want to the colors are great it has such  vibrant colors, they have the neutral the fun colors the everyday colors its great for traveling if you don&#x27;t want the big palettes great buy highly recommend</li>
    <li> I have some expencive eye shadow brands , but it really works as well as them even better.Colors are vibrant and rich and stay for several hours without smudging or creasing.My sister loved it too and I&#x27;m buying another one for her.Highly recommended</li>
    <li> These are so shiny and look great when combined with a matte color. I don&#x27;t really use the applicators though since I have my own set of brushes. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter for her birthday. She absolutely loves it. The colors are true and go on smooth. She has used lots of makeup kits in the past and says this one is by far the BEST. She has told me thank you at least a hundred times since she got this in March.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting the colors to be as creamy as they were, so I thought that that was a little weird (I&#x27;m used to only powder shadows), but the color palette was beautiful.  And the colors stay on really well with my eyeshadow primer.  they are so vibrant and pretty.  I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a gift for my beautiful wife, and she loves it! My wife is not usually the type to wear makeup everyday, but since receiving this product she has been. She has been having a lot of fun trying all the colors with her different outfits, and gets a lot of compliments. Everything arrived packaged perfectly, and we recieved it very quickly. She has told me she will only be purchasing Shany products from now on. This makes a really great gift for your special lady, or the little lady in your life.</li>
    <li> Love the colors. Need to apply quiet a bit to get a decent shade, but over all im satisfied, i wanted a decent amount for a reasonable price and this does the job</li>
    <li> I love all the colors on this, I love this product so much. I might end up buying a smaller version because I don&#x27;t wear makeup as much as I though cause they&#x27;re so many colors I didn&#x27;t get to use. Still an amazing deal for ALL these colors compared to Ulta and Wal-Mart and I work at Wal-Mart lol</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking to upgrade your eye makeup this is the perfect all-in-one product at the ridiculously cheap price. I look forward to doing my eye makeup at every opportunity and have yet to repeat a color combination. I read other reviews then was shallowly expecting compliments and I got them! Color goes on exactly where you place it and stays (even through a shower, so get your oil based remover out) no cream base needed. I can&#x27;t praise this kit enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re considering it, just buy it. You will have no regrets.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeshadow! Better than any other brand!!!!!! Seriously, it goes on true to color and does not fade off, not even into the night.</li>
    <li> The case is light weight and can fit in all my purses. If you  add eye primer before adding the eye shadow it will last you all day. The only thing I did not like about it is the applicators never stay in place besides that the eye shadows are worth buying and it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
