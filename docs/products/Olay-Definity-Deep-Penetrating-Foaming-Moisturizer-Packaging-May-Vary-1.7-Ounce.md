      <li>I liked this moisturizer but wouldnt say I love it.</li>
      <li>Very light since it is foam when it comes out of the bottle.</li>
      <li>This product is okay....</li>
      <li>They do make a version with UV protection, but I surely hope they keep manufacturing this one.</li>

      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>AND THIS OLAY DEFINITY DEEP FOAMING, KEEPS MY FACE LOOKING GREAT!</li>
      <li>The bonus for me is I cannot use any SPF or UV protection, so I am so glad there is none in this product.  </li>
      <li>The product that I received does not, making it of no use to me on most days.  </li>
      <li>I liked this face cream because it goes on light and did not leave my face feeling sticky like many creams.</li>
      <li>I am sure the vacation itself helped</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an okay moisturiser</li>
      <li>so I trust it even more.</li>
      <li>Yes, the texture was new to me but it works great for something that goes on so light.  </li>
      <li>That one goes on nicer, is in a more familiar form of a lotion pump, does not sting and has sun protection.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of the Olay Regenerist line, so when I read about this one, with skin lighteners, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Being a huge fan of Olay products, I knew that I could trust this, and have not had any irritation whatsoever.  </li>
      <li>The package is  wasteful on this and all the Definity products in terms of the huge hunk of plastic involved.</li>
      <li>My mineral makeup goes on smoothly with this product.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly; you can feel it \\&quot;plump\\&quot; up your skin.  </li>
      <li>It wasnt cheap either.</li>
      <li>Still, for a moisturizer that helps to minimize spots (or lighten&lt;br /&gt;the dark ones), it&#x27;s a VERY good product.</li>
      <li>A  soft, silky feeling product I am sure you will; love.</li>
      <li>I noticed a difference after the very first use in the size of my pores and how smooth my skin felt.  </li>
      <li>It seemed to sit on top of my skin without really sinking in.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a good enough answer for me, I will return my order.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see that it is any better than most similar products....</li>
      <li>This lightwieght foam moisturizer is great as a lightwight moisturizer if you don&#x27;t like heavy products or have oily skin.</li>
      <li>and if you have sensitive skin, and acne prone skin like me you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
      <li>but I also noticed that my spots were lighter, pores smaller and skin more smooth.  </li>
      <li>I kept on using it after I got back since it seems to work better than the quinine.  </li>
      <li>It really is deep penetrating and does not roll off like many moisturizers.</li>
      <li>When I first applied the moisturizer, it was so nourishing</li>
      <li>First of all, I don&#x27;t notice any smell as did one reveiwer.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling super moisturized an not heavy with gunk.</li>
      <li>Has amazing results after a few weeks&#x27; time.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t really say anything about its anti-aging ability</li>
      <li>The moisturizing foam is so smooth and does a terrific job of softening my skin.  </li>
      <li>I really like the foaming moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I am very unimpressed with this product.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this Olay product, but it&#x27;s getting harder to find.  </li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need the much when putting it on.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles</li>
      <li>I love this product for the fact it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin to wet that makeup runs.  </li>
      <li>This foaming moisturizer goes on smooth and a little covers a lot.</li>
      <li>My skin broke out and took a couple of weeks to clear up.</li>
      <li>Makes your face feel so soft.</li>
      <li>Not to heavy and really smooth when applying.</li>
      <li>Even in the morning, my skin felt soft but not oily.</li>
      <li>It leaves my face soft.</li>
      <li>At 37 years old, I thought that glow was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The foaming action is so light and isnt messy.</li>
      <li>There really is a radiance to my face, even after a long day at work.</li>
      <li>is the only new product I have tried in over one month.  </li>
      <li>I enjoy the foam, &amp; a little does go a long way.</li>
      <li>This is the only moisturizer that gives clearly visible results for me.  </li>
      <li>This includes the cleansers, daily and night moisturizers which have made my skin soft and never break out using any of the products.</li>
      <li>(  This was the first cream/lotion that I have used that truly made my dark spots disappear.</li>
      <li>:o</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely not for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>only wish is that it had more active ingredients, like white tea or vita C or other antioxidant.  </li>
      <li>MAJOR definitely lessened.  </li>
      <li>The product, which my wife wanted for her birthday but which I had been unable to find in stores, arrived quickly and was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>This is a product that I have used for a few years, so I wonder if this particular product is old or was stored incorrectly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of messy and smells a little sour.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product, which my wife wanted for her birthday but which I had been unable to find in stores, arrived quickly and was exactly what I was looking for.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This lightwieght foam moisturizer is great as a lightwight moisturizer if you don&#x27;t like heavy products or have oily skin.</li>
    <li> After 2 months use, 2 spots on my cheeks have faded from dark brown to pale pink - very noticeable improvement.</li>
    <li> as always Olay has very good products. I got this one at a terriffic price.</li>
    <li> To start off I dont see any improvement in wrinkles, but the worst part is that if you rub your forehead it rubs off and flakes, nasty. It wasnt cheap either. The way it goes on is annoying too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. Very light since it is foam when it comes out of the bottle. This moisturizer is a Good Housekeeping number 1 product so I trust it even more.</li>
    <li> This product is okay....I don&#x27;t see that it is any better than most similar products....many of which are less expensive</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 35 and have oily acne prone skin.  I was a loyal Proactiv customer, but over the last year my skin was looking dull and starting to show signs of aging.  I love this product.  I have been using it for 2 months with the Definity Pore Redefining Scrub and have seen noticable results.  I noticed a difference after the very first use in the size of my pores and how smooth my skin felt.  Since then, my skin had gotten brighter, clearer and some of the dark \\&quot;sun\\&quot; spots have faded. When I first applied the moisturizer, it was so nourishing I was afraid it would make me break out, but it didn&#x27;t.  Even in the morning, my skin felt soft but not oily.</li>
    <li> Olay does it again.  I love this product for the fact it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin to wet that makeup runs.  Yet it provides instant results and lasts all day long.  I have very dry skin.  However I  perspire constantly always have since a kid.  Other moisturizers only add to the sweating.  A  soft, silky feeling product I am sure you will; love.</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizer that gives clearly visible results for me.  It fades my sun spots.  I stopped using it for a few months because I had switched to hydro-quinine for the spots.  Then I went on vacation for 2 weeks and pared down my skin care to this one essential moisturizer.  After 2 weeks of using it again everyone remarked on how refreshed I looked.  I am sure the vacation itself helped but I also noticed that my spots were lighter, pores smaller and skin more smooth.  I kept on using it after I got back since it seems to work better than the quinine.  It also helps a dry scratchy spot on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that it had more active ingredients, like white tea or vita C or other antioxidant.  But it does work as is.</li>
    <li> First of all, I don&#x27;t notice any smell as did one reveiwer.  Yes, the texture was new to me but it works great for something that goes on so light.  I also noticed that my makeup stays fresher longer, and that my wrinkles are alot less noticable.  Being a huge fan of Olay products, I knew that I could trust this, and have not had any irritation whatsoever.  It will continue to be part of my morning routine.</li>
    <li> Although I ordered this product, I didn&#x27;t realize it was different than what I had bought previously in the store.  Beware that this is a scented version without any SPF.  In the store, I bought an unscented version with SPF 15.  I thought I was buying the same thing here.  They do sell the other version, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.  I personally do not want something without SPF or with a scent.  The scent isn&#x27;t horrible though and it does go on smooth, like the other version.  I really like the foaming moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 4 days the moisturizer was greasy on my face and I felt like my skin could not breathe, I did not see any difference in my skin due to my time using it but I broke out from it big time. I am very unimpressed with this product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this Olay product, but it&#x27;s getting harder to find.  The moisturizing foam is so smooth and does a terrific job of softening my skin.  I&#x27;ve noticed that this particular product from Olay also lightens those annoying dark age spots better than all the other Olay products.  Sure hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it!</li>
    <li> Olay foam moisturizer is the best moisturizer I have ever used. The foaming action is so light and isnt messy. It hydrates your skin as well as refreshes it. I love this product.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this product the photo and description stated that it had SPF15.  The product that I received does not, making it of no use to me on most days.  In addition to that the product has a tan color and stings when applied to the skin.  This is a product that I have used for a few years, so I wonder if this particular product is old or was stored incorrectly.</li>
    <li> I HAVE VERY DRY SKIN AND THIS OLAY DEFINITY DEEP FOAMING, KEEPS MY FACE LOOKING GREAT! I ALSO USE IT AT NIGHT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite a while and it works extremely well on brown spots and discolorations on my face and chest.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of the Olay Regenerist line, so when I read about this one, with skin lighteners, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have freckles and a few large sun spots on my face. The freckles really don&#x27;t bother me, but the sun spots do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see any skin lightening, but my skin texture is so much smoother and the little lines are plumper and less noticable. There really is a radiance to my face, even after a long day at work. At 37 years old, I thought that glow was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope it helps the sun-spots, but even if it doesn&#x27;t (nothing else has) I&#x27;ll keep using it for the skin-texture improvements.</li>
    <li> I love this Olay Definity Foam Moisturizer. It&#x27;s not that big of a bottle but it does go a long way. You don&#x27;t need the much when putting it on. I am 28 and I have still have a little acne, not as much when I was a teenager, but I think it also helps for people who has acne on their skin, it&#x27;s not greasy and if you have sensitive skin, and acne prone skin like me you&#x27;ll love it. Doesn&#x27;t bother or make you flare up at all... I wish I had known about this when I was a teenager maybe it could have helped me sooner. Great Product that I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> My order is labeled made in China. With all the recent problems with products manufactured in China I am a bit leary about using them. I emailed the seller thru Amazon 3 days ago, asking if this a knock-off product, and they have not responded. That&#x27;s a good enough answer for me, I will return my order.</li>
    <li> This foaming moisturizer goes on smooth and a little covers a lot. I have been an Olay customer since the age of 15 and these are the only products I use. I have tried others but always came back to Olay. This includes the cleansers, daily and night moisturizers which have made my skin soft and never break out using any of the products. Olay products really do moisturize and your skin does not feel tight or dry. This product and all Olay products are wonderful!</li>
    <li> Smell?  What smell?  None that I noticed.  I&#x27;ve been using this product since it was introduced to the market.  I am 42 &amp; have those hideous sun blotches we were all warned about, but didn&#x27;t care when we were teens!  I don&#x27;t have wrinkles or lines, so I can&#x27;t speak to those, but the sun blotches definitely have lessened.  MAJOR definitely lessened.  Big improvement in my skin.  I enjoy the foam, &amp; a little does go a long way. The bonus for me is I cannot use any SPF or UV protection, so I am so glad there is none in this product.  They do make a version with UV protection, but I surely hope they keep manufacturing this one.</li>
    <li> Why foam? It&#x27;s kind of messy and smells a little sour. It definitely tingles on application for me which is uncomfortable. A little goes a long way. It seemed to sit on top of my skin without really sinking in. The package is  wasteful on this and all the Definity products in terms of the huge hunk of plastic involved. It&#x27;s an okay moisturiser but it does not hold a candle to the correcting protective lotion in the same line. That one goes on nicer, is in a more familiar form of a lotion pump, does not sting and has sun protection. Gives all the same glucosamine benefits too.    Skip this one and get the Definity correcting protective lotion.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It&#x27;s foamy and it moisturizes well.  I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles so I can&#x27;t really say anything about its anti-aging ability but I do like the way it feels.  I use it as a night moisturizer since I have oily skin and don&#x27;t need something like this during the day.  I do like the way it feels. It leaves my face soft.</li>
    <li> I loved this stuff!  I hate Olay for discontinuing it. :o(  This was the first cream/lotion that I have used that truly made my dark spots disappear. I don&#x27;t understand why they would quit producing something that actually worked.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I have used it for about two years now. It really is deep penetrating and does not roll off like many moisturizers. My mineral makeup goes on smoothly with this product.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I have ever used. It leaves my skin feeling super moisturized an not heavy with gunk. It also has a great illuminating effects that give you a glowing look.</li>
    <li> Product is wonderful.  Goes on smoothly; you can feel it \\&quot;plump\\&quot; up your skin.  Has amazing results after a few weeks&#x27; time.</li>
    <li> I liked this face cream because it goes on light and did not leave my face feeling sticky like many creams.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on the recommendation of a well known magazine. It&#x27;s definitely not for sensitive skin. My skin broke out and took a couple of weeks to clear up. Also, because it is a foam, it&#x27;s really hard to control the amount you want. I don&#x27;t know why anyone would make a foam moisturizer...doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense. I didn&#x27;t find it all that moisturizing. Will never buy again.</li>
    <li> Olay products are the best-This moisturizer in the store has been replaced by another one-But I use sunscreen separately so this is the best moisturizer I have used-Glad I can still get it on Amazon</li>
    <li> I liked this moisturizer but wouldnt say I love it. I reallly do not notice a difference between this and Aveeno moisturizing lotion. Perhaps it&#x27;ll work if you continue to use it but who knows? It is quite expensive. But works well.</li>
    <li> I tried this product on a recommendation from a leading magazine.  Two days after using the product, my skin broke out in bumps and my eyes and lips became swollen.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only new product I have tried in over one month.  I am returning it.  Beware.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Great for Daytime wear. Not to heavy and really smooth when applying. Makes your face feel so soft.</li>
    <li> One of the best products on the market. It is a little pricey but less than the plastic surgeon. Only requires a very small amount.</li>
    <li> I recall when this was an under $5 product.  However since Olay has discontinued&lt;br /&gt;producing this - it&#x27;s $$$.  Still, for a moisturizer that helps to minimize spots (or lighten&lt;br /&gt;the dark ones), it&#x27;s a VERY good product.</li>
</ol>
