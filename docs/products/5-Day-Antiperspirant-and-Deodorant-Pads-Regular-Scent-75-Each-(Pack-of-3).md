      <li>My wife highly endorses the product and is pleased with the purchase.</li>
      <li>It is probably worth a try if you have that problem, but does not work for everyone.</li>
      <li>I am surprised  it has been removed from many stores and replaced by these roll on that require a pasty solution to allow the roll on process.</li>
      <li>Well of course when I was younger I had my own ideas of what I preferred</li>
      <li>It is effective in keeping both of us dry and</li>
      <li>This is a very good antiperspirant and deodorant but is very hard to find in stores.</li>
      <li>It was the only thing that kept my boys all through school and after school activities Love it</li>
      <li>For me, I now sweat more on my torso and even shoulders, but for me I can hide this with an undershirt, and is the lesser of two evils.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for ages and it&#x27;s no longer available in any stores near me.  </li>
      <li>cost effective, never lets you down</li>
      <li>Fast delivery</li>
      <li>VERY STAND UP</li>
      <li>My dermatologist said is was ok to use in areas other than armpits.</li>
      <li>My Mother always used and liked the Five Day Deodorant Pads, she always stated to me that it really does last five days long if you need it to.  </li>
      <li>Much better than all those other so called deodorants.</li>
      <li>I went to Michigan where I previously was able to get it and</li>
      <li>I have used the product for more than 40 years and I find it is not available readily at stores anymore.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>Now being a little older and a whole lot wiser and also needing to find the product for my mother one day because it was no longer on the shelves of the drug stores or super markets, I turned to Amazon and found exactly what I needed and was looking for, for my mother.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This antiperspirant is the same type that you are supposed to apply at bedtime (&amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34;).  </li>
      <li>This has a very high percentage of the active ingredient, yet it has absolutely zero burn compared to the others out there, many of them with much less of the ingredient.</li>
      <li>This product is a clear liquid that comes on disposable pads.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for years and now can only find it on amazon ...  Works very well for me</li>
      <li>This has really allowed me to go out and be in public in the summer months.</li>
      <li>Far surpasses all &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; formulas.</li>
      <li>Several of the damp pads in a sandwich bag are perfectly legal in suitcases that can be carried on the plane.</li>
      <li>Found it here online, and I&#x27;d say it lives up to the expectations I remembered from the old days.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately, this is a product that is not carried by most stores that sell many other brands.</li>
      <li>It is a little inconvenient to apply but it is the BEST deodorant in the world.</li>
      <li>I was shocked at $46.00 shipping but happy to have the product.  </li>

<li> That is the only bad thing I can say about this product.</li>
<li> Very hard to locate..</li>
<li> Also very hard to find it in the stores.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s too bad they don&#x27;t sell in stores anymore</li>
<li> One of the roll on products had a burn that was terrible.</li>

    <li> I have used this product since College, I graduated in 1972. I have tried all others and I keep coming back to this product. It was the only thing that kept my boys all through school and after school activities Love it</li>
    <li> This is the real MCCoy and at a fair price with fast turnaround from this seller.  My wife highly endorses the product and is pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for ages and it&#x27;s no longer available in any stores near me.  Being able to get it online is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Got these for my grandmother who LOVES these. She was so happy to see it arrive. I heard her talking about CVS not carrying it anymore so i found these online and made her day.</li>
    <li> We have used this product for 55 years and have never had any perspiration or staining of clothing. It has always worked great, don&#x27;t know why it is not advertised more. Much better than all those other so called deodorants.</li>
    <li> This is a very good antiperspirant and deodorant but is very hard to find in stores. That is the only bad thing I can say about this product. Otherwise it is very good.</li>
    <li> 5 Day Deodorant pads are an excellent product. Besides being an effective antipersperand and deodorant, it&#x27;s also good to pack for airplane travel. Several of the damp pads in a sandwich bag are perfectly legal in suitcases that can be carried on the plane. Unfortunately, this is a product that is not carried by most stores that sell many other brands. It&#x27;s great to be able to get it online at a good price.</li>
    <li> VERY STAND UP ITEM DOES NOT BURN OR STAIN CLOTHES WILL USE AND TELL OTHERS ABOUT THIS PRODUCT NOT A LOUD PRODUCT</li>
    <li> This antiperspirant is the same type that you are supposed to apply at bedtime (&amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34;).  I tried this because it&#x27;s cheaper than roll-ons and sticks with the same ingredient.  This product is a clear liquid that comes on disposable pads.  My jar, once I opened it, leaked every time I accidentally tilted it.  I quickly decided that I don&#x27;t like getting antiperspirant on my fingertips (and this is difficult to wash off), so I went back to what I was previously using.  Note that this product may take a few days to start working...You can&#x27;t just use it once and expect to not sweat (like traditional antiperspirants).</li>
    <li> have used it for fourty years.no marking of your clothing.  dependable protection. clean easy application. cost effective, never lets you down</li>
    <li> These are very effective and without a strong scent</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for a person in my family who has excessive sweating. It is probably worth a try if you have that problem, but does not work for everyone.</li>
    <li> It is a little inconvenient to apply but it is the BEST deodorant in the world. We love it a lot and have been using for YEARS.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and it is a best product my mother uses and she loves it</li>
    <li> This product works and I have used it for years.  Just wish I could buy it at a local pharmacy!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 years.  I like that it works for me neutralizing odor and helping with perspiration.  No white marks on clothing. I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My husband won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> Best deoderant out there! Far surpasses all &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; formulas.</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant I have ever used. It don&#x27;t leave a ring on your clothing or your skin. You can go a day without using the deodorant and you are still covered. I gave a jar to my grandson and he love it, so it he think it is great since he wear sleeveless  shirt.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a long long time and finally found something that worked for me it&#x27;s too bad they don&#x27;t sell in stores anymore</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and now can only find it on amazon ...  Works very well for me</li>
    <li> This is a great product, especially for summer.</li>
    <li> This is the kind of deodorant I&#x27;ve used for years and it works perfectly for me!  I would recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I have used it all of my life and I am 72. I went to Michigan where I previously was able to get it and no-one had it.  I found it on Google and sent for it.  I was shocked at $46.00 shipping but happy to have the product.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Works great,but the fragrance could be better. Also very hard to find it in the stores.</li>
    <li> My Mother always used and liked the Five Day Deodorant Pads, she always stated to me that it really does last five days long if you need it to.  Well of course when I was younger I had my own ideas of what I preferred and that&#x27;s what I purchased.  Now being a little older and a whole lot wiser and also needing to find the product for my mother one day because it was no longer on the shelves of the drug stores or super markets, I turned to Amazon and found exactly what I needed and was looking for, for my mother.&lt;br /&gt;I can always count on Amazon.com to have what I need or at least a close replacement and/or suggestion.&lt;br /&gt;This product also comes in a Roll-on form as well (which I like and prefer to the pads) but it works just as well as the pads for I have tried both and both work great.&lt;br /&gt;This is a super product and I am so glad that I can now still get it for her the way she likes it (in the pad form) and now for me (in the roll on form).&lt;br /&gt;It really is a great product that should never have left the shelves.  It is effective in keeping both of us dry and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;D. Baker</li>
    <li> Most effective. This deodorant is a winner. It is not sticky and tacky. It dries almost instantly and the protection is 100%. I am surprised  it has been removed from many stores and replaced by these roll on that require a pasty solution to allow the roll on process. This product is the essence without the gook.</li>
    <li> 5 day antiperspirant and Deodorant Pads meet my needs perfectly.  I have used the product for more than 40 years and I find it is not available readily at stores anymore.  Very hard to locate.. I was very happy to see that I was able to order it at Amazon..</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this deodorant! Can&#x27;t buy it in stores anymore! Hope it stays on Amazon, great price and fast shipping</li>
    <li> This product has been around for a long time, but is pretty much impossible to find in stores.  Found it here online, and I&#x27;d say it lives up to the expectations I remembered from the old days.  It does take a while to dry after applying, but that is to be expected, since it is liquid form instead of a solid.  I expect we will be purchasing more when this shipment runs out.  We bought the three-pack.</li>
    <li> This has really allowed me to go out and be in public in the summer months. I have cranial hyperhidrosis really bad (facial and head sweating), and with this product, I am able to curtail it by about 85-90%. My dermatologist said is was ok to use in areas other than armpits. The problem is that I experience compensatory hyperhidrosis (sweating in other areas instead of the treated area). For me, I now sweat more on my torso and even shoulders, but for me I can hide this with an undershirt, and is the lesser of two evils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to put this on before bed; it&#x27;s not meant to be put on in the morning before work. Your sweat glands need to absorb it and nighttime is when they aren&#x27;t active. I also need to use it nightly. This has a very high percentage of the active ingredient, yet it has absolutely zero burn compared to the others out there, many of them with much less of the ingredient. One of the roll on products had a burn that was terrible.</li>
