      <li>These are great for getting to those hard to reach places and great for kids that wear braces.  </li>
      <li>this product is great when you don&#x27;t have the opportunity to brush and great to get to all of the hard to reach places the braces create.</li>
      <li>the gum line, and the pointed brush tufts easily reach the area between teeth.  </li>
      <li>If you have remaining wisdom teeth or other hard-to-brush spots, the dual angled heads will give you the perfect orientation to get your mouth perfectly clean.</li>
      <li>These things work great to get in the back areas where the tooth meets the gum line, where a brush won&#x27;t fit.</li>
      <li>It works great on the back teeth to toughen up your gums so they don&#x27;t bleed when you get your teeth cleaned.  </li>

      <li>I have 2 implants to hold in my lower dentures and this is where I need a fine brush to get under the gum line to clean.</li>

      <li>I still have the original one that I bought years ago.  </li>
      <li>Got the first Sulcabrush from the dentist and bought another for my spouse because I was so satisfied with it.  </li>
      <li>Works great, and my teeth feel cleaner all day long!</li>
      <li>It is slim and I can now clean the inside bottom teeth to remove coffee stain.  </li>
      <li>The Sulcabrush clean and the toothpaste make you teeth like granite.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for over 10 years and my dentist can&#x27;t believe how clean my teeth are.</li>
      <li>This brush is designed to clean plaque from around the gumline.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent toothbrush,it gets to the back and between my teeth like no other.</li>
      <li>Thank you for such good service</li>
      <li>I love this, it really works in removing  plaque on the gum line.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a full lengh sulcabrush.  </li>
      <li>good for in-between cleanings, but not for daily use.  </li>
      <li>They wear out kinda quick, but I am using it with Ultrapro Tx tooth polish, so that might be it...</li>
      <li>It arrived really quickly.</li>
      <li>I can get that fresh flossed clean feeling without spending half an hour picking the floss out of my teeth, and it is great for stains, too.</li>
      <li>This sulcabrush makes such an amazing difference.  </li>
      <li>I purchased new handles and replacement brushes for other members of my family, and just replacement brushes for myself, because my original handle is still in great shape.</li>
      <li>It just feels plain great to use this product once you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I began using the Sulca Brush right after a cleaning, and I use it every morning.</li>
      <li>Now, when I get my teeth cleaned, my hygienist says there isn&#x27;t much for her to clean.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to use and only takes a minute to do the job.</li>
      <li>One of the best little inventions in the dental world--IF you know how to use it properly.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was quick &amp; the cost reasonable.</li>
      <li>I like this very much.</li>
      <li>I think it has improved my oral health care very much.</li>
      <li>Got this toothbrush on time it is exactly like described.</li>
      <li>I use this daily and love it.</li>
      <li>works exactly like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
      <li>My hygienist first introduced me to the sulcabrush.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much more than a regular toothbrush</li>
      <li>I use this brush to work around the gum lines and in the hard to reach back areas of my teeth and it is awesome!</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s doing any good.</li>
      <li>My dentist always tells me on my bi-annual dental check up that my teeth are so clean she barely has anything to do!</li>
      <li>Certainly does not get between teeth like floss,</li>
      <li>and I can enjoy my coffee withouout worrying about my next dental cleaning since my dintist scolded me everytime because of my coffee stain.</li>
      <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>It really stimulates my gums.</li>
      <li>This has helped so much.</li>
      <li>Handle provides very convenient angle for brushes.  </li>
      <li>It has one side for top side of teeth, and the other side for the underside.  </li>
      <li>As a result a regular toothbrush (even baby toothbrushes) won&#x27;t clean the interior of my front bottom teeth.  </li>
      <li>My teeth have seriously never felt cleaner.  </li>
      <li>Clever invention.....</li>
      <li>If you, like me, use soft toothbrushes (as I&#x27;ve been told everyone should), just break in new sulcabrush heads with your thumb before first use.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I started using a Sulcabrush about a year ago.I think it has improved my oral health care very much. I use this little brush,after I brush my teeth with a traditional tooth brush,solely near the gum line and to get in between my teeth, for that extra clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this item !</li>
    <li> I am at the beginning stage of peridontal desease, and trying to keep it at bay. My dental hygenist recommended I use this for getting at the back gum area of my teeth. I am using it, but find it very difficult to manuvere.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s o.k. It&#x27;s what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I have used a Sulcabrush for years after being introduced to it by a dental hygienist.  I always get rave revues from my dentist about the health of my gums and the absence of plaque.  It doesn&#x27;t take long to use it, and it is priceless.</li>
    <li> I use this brush to work around the gum lines and in the hard to reach back areas of my teeth and it is awesome! Works great, and my teeth feel cleaner all day long!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  However, the packaging was slightly open exposing the product.</li>
    <li> This brush gets at the gaps between your teeth the way no other brush can. It can also get at the area behind your back teeth. It has definitely helped me avoid cavitites.</li>
    <li> This product is one of my faves, as a replacement to flossing.</li>
    <li> This product works great for me with my braces. with classes all day plus two jobs and a sport it is difficult to brush throughout the day. this product is great when you don&#x27;t have the opportunity to brush and great to get to all of the hard to reach places the braces create. i use mine everyday and will continue to do so until my braces come off.</li>
    <li> My periodontist &amp;#34;prescribed&amp;#34; the daily use of a sulcabrush and taught me how to use it.  The theory is that most of the plaque and teeth-ruining gunk settle at and around the gum line. So between flossing and sulcabrushing, you remove 90% or so of the bad stuff and your regular ol&#x27; toothbrush takes care of the rest.  My teeth have seriously never felt cleaner.  My only gripe is that I did not start using (or even know about) the sulcabrush until last week.  My teeth would be in better shape had I started years ago!  This should be a part of your daily oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> This is my second Sulcabrush.  My first was given to me by my previous dentist.  It is an excellent tool to brush at the gum line.  It has one side for top side of teeth, and the other side for the underside.  It is very easy to use and only takes a minute to do the job.</li>
    <li> This brush is not the same as the Dr Sulcabrush, it&#x27;s much thicker and does not fit under the gum line as well as the Dr Sulcabrush. I have 2 implants to hold in my lower dentures and this is where I need a fine brush to get under the gum line to clean.</li>
    <li> This has helped so much. I love the tips, the way it gets below the gum line. My cleanings are much improved when I use this product along with my other dental tools.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> It cleans well in between my teeth and it helps keep my gums in better condition. I use it regularly.</li>
    <li> My dentist gave me a free Sulcabrush to use for behind my wisdom teeth. This brush is fantastic for cleaning behind there, no more cavities there and better breath. I just buy the sulca tips to screw on the handle. I wish I knew about this product ages ago.</li>
    <li> The bristles are very stiff. If you like a softer flexible bristle this is not the sulca brush to buy. In my opinion you should not be using stiff bristles on the gum line.</li>
    <li> The sulcabrush is an incredible invention--it has done wonders for my gums and is extremely easy to use.  I will always use one and would recommend it to all!</li>
    <li> Handle provides very convenient angle for brushes.  Highly recommend it.  More comfortable than flossing.....or for use in addition to flossing.</li>
    <li> This product gets into the cracks of you teeth and gums and cleans away all unwanted foreign mater in your mouth. It works great on the back teeth to toughen up your gums so they don&#x27;t bleed when you get your teeth cleaned.  I do recommend this product after using it for a while now and going to the dentists office is not so bad any more.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dentist and I found it on Amazon at the best price.  I think you will like it.</li>
    <li> A useful tool for good oral care.  I had difficulty finding a replacement in local stores I would expect to carry such item</li>
    <li> The Sulcabrush cleans the hard to get places that I don&#x27;t get well withmy regular toothbrush.  Great for touch-ups after brushing</li>
    <li> I was having a problem with staining both behind my lower, front teeth and between the front of my lower, front teeth. Even though I would get my teeth cleaned every 6 months and brush fastidiously twice a day, the brown stains would always appear several months before my next cleaning.The staining was from coffee and cigarettes. My dental hygienist recommended the Sulca Brush for the staining, even though that&#x27;s not it&#x27;s intended use. It works like a MIRACLE in preventing the staining!! I began using the Sulca Brush right after a cleaning, and I use it every morning. Now,I NEVER get any staining. Now, when I get my teeth cleaned, my hygienist says there isn&#x27;t much for her to clean. I&#x27;m so grateful my hygienist told me about the Sulca Brush for staining, or I never would have known because it&#x27;s not advertised for stain prevention. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My hygienist first introduced me to the sulcabrush. I have found it to be extremely valuable in preventing the build-up of  plaque near the gumline and stimulating my gums. The brushes can be popped out and replaced in the handle whenever they start to wear.  Obtaining the travel pouch and keeping one in the car for use while commuting is one way to gain increasing benefits from the sulcabrush, or just taking a minute of additional time during your hygiene routine or while watching a favorite program on television. It doesn&#x27;t take long to trace the gumline inside and out and the soft brushes are great for focusing on any weak areas.</li>
    <li> My check ups at the dentist have improved since using the sulcabrush. The overall health of my gums has improved and the hygienist was very happy with the results. My gums are firmer and healthier. The hygienist told me to keep doing whatever I was doing!</li>
    <li> I have hybrid dentures and this product works great for cleaning the posts.  The different angled brushes make it so much easier.  I&#x27;m really happy I tried it, it works just the way they say it will.</li>
    <li> I love this, it really works in removing  plaque on the gum line. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Got the first Sulcabrush from the dentist and bought another for my spouse because I was so satisfied with it.  Much more effective and easier to maneuver than either floss or picks.</li>
    <li> I have a very narrow jaw line.  As a result a regular toothbrush (even baby toothbrushes) won&#x27;t clean the interior of my front bottom teeth.  The Sulcabrush does the job and I think my front bottom teeth are whiter/cleaner already.</li>
    <li> Ordered several of these a few yrs ago &amp; still love it.  It&#x27;s perfect for people who don&#x27;t like to floss.This works better.&lt;br /&gt;Again, had a good experience in ordering &amp; receiving product.&lt;br /&gt; Thank you for such good service</li>
    <li> THe kids got a kick out of mastering it&#x27;s use and I wish all dentists made this recommendation.  Mine did.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent toothbrush,it gets to the back and between my teeth like no other. I couldn&#x27;t live without this.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product as frequent use will show when you visit your dentist.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent, reduces ware and tear on the teeth, and good to get between the teeth.I have bought many times, Unfortunately the tips are rather expensive.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great good for gum care..</li>
    <li> My wife likes these. She is a big flosser so it fits her well. I tried to get her to just buy the tips but she says it&#x27;s too combersome.</li>
    <li> This is the product for you.  This is my second one and it works very well around gums and between teeth.</li>
    <li> Best thing ever for my gums</li>
    <li> This Sulcabrush was a replacement for one I dropped down the drain at a hotel.  At least it wasn&#x27;t my own drain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of the Sulcabrush.  I use it with a fluoride paste after brushing and flossing.</li>
    <li> This is an effective dental tool which helps me get areas of my mouth I couldn&#x27;t otherwise get using just a toothbrush....</li>
    <li> Works great and the design makes it easy to reach harder places. I like this very much. This ridiculous web page keeps telling me that I need to add more words. How dumb is that?</li>
    <li> Cleans the inside of gums and outside very well. I get compliments from my dentist on the good job I&#x27;m doing.</li>
    <li> These are great for getting to those hard to reach places and great for kids that wear braces.  Love these.</li>
    <li> Have been using Sulcabrush for 15 years. My dentist always tells me on my bi-annual dental check up that my teeth are so clean she barely has anything to do!</li>
    <li> Came early and as described - this brush is excellent and does exactly what it says. It works great instead of flossing if you have braces. Our dental check ups have been excellent.</li>
    <li> I use this daily and love it.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the product.  It is slim and I can now clean the inside bottom teeth to remove coffee stain.  My dentist is going to be happy with me and I can enjoy my coffee withouout worrying about my next dental cleaning since my dintist scolded me everytime because of my coffee stain.</li>
    <li> LIke a small firm toothbrush... I thought one side was a cup. My mistake. They wear out kinda quick, but I am using it with Ultrapro Tx tooth polish, so that might be it...</li>
    <li> On the recommendation of my dental hygienist I purchased  this Sulcabrush to enhance my dental care regime of brushing and flossing.  It performs well in getting to the areas along the gum line that flossing and brushing can miss. It also messages the gums to help keep them healthy.</li>
    <li> It really stimulates my gums.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for over 10 years and my dentist can&#x27;t believe how clean my teeth are.</li>
    <li> I have never been a fan of flossing, always struck me as a messy job involving &amp;#34;icky fingers&amp;#34;.  A few years ago I received my first Sulcabrush gratis from my dentist, &amp; it opened a new world!  Rather than deal with the ick factor wrapping floss around my teeth, (&amp; I&#x27;ve tried the waxed, non-waxed, flavored) this Sulcabrush is simple &amp; basically &amp;#34;ick-less&amp;#34;.  The tiny bristle brush ends do a marvelous job cleaning away the tartar from teeth @ the gum line, and the pointed brush tufts easily reach the area between teeth.  This brush makes a once-dreaded end-of-day job into an easier task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One brush end&#x27;s marked &amp;#34;inside&amp;#34; for inside teeth, the other&#x27;s marked &amp;#34;outside&amp;#34;, angled for outside areas.  Couldn&#x27;t be simpler.  When not in use I park my brush on one of those little character eyeglass rests you find in stores, that way the brush ends air- dry &amp; it&#x27;s handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I have yet to find a retail store that sells these brushes, thank God for Amazon.com!  Shipping was quick &amp; the cost reasonable.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my new Dentist due to the fact that I floss every day, but was still having problems with my gums bleeding. After a couple of weeks of using the Sulcabrush, they&#x27;ve stopped and are no longer hyper-sensitive. It&#x27;s a cheap, must have tool for good dental hygiene.</li>
    <li> This brush is designed to clean plaque from around the gumline. Then use a regular toothbroush with 1.1% fluoride toothpaste and say goodbye to  dental problems. The Sulcabrush clean and the toothpaste make you teeth like granite. Have to buy the toothpaste from a dentist.</li>
    <li> I got this brush to reach my molars. It is hard to brush the back of them. This brush is as wide as a regular tooth brush. It just shorter with one small group of bristles rather than a long group of bristles. Thus it is almost as hard to clean tight spaces with this brush. I wish it was thinner.</li>
    <li> My teeth are very close together, to the point that even extra thin dental tape is prone to breakage and getting stuck. This makes regular flossing a nightmare. This sulcabrush makes such an amazing difference.  I can get that fresh flossed clean feeling without spending half an hour picking the floss out of my teeth, and it is great for stains, too. If you have remaining wisdom teeth or other hard-to-brush spots, the dual angled heads will give you the perfect orientation to get your mouth perfectly clean. Once you get started it can be a little addictive. It just feels plain great to use this product once you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will warn you that they bristles tend toward medium.  If you, like me, use soft toothbrushes (as I&#x27;ve been told everyone should), just break in new sulcabrush heads with your thumb before first use.  Then take the first few brushes slow and easy until your gums get used to the new head.  In general, never apply much force when brushing near the gums.</li>
    <li> I been using te Sulca brush for years (15) .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This enables me to continue keeping my teeth/gums&lt;br /&gt; exercised &amp; healthy.</li>
    <li> Clever invention.....good for in-between cleanings, but not for daily use.  I would say once or  twice a week to remove early build-up of tartar and coffee, tea and tobacco staining is sufficient.  Also, use it instead of a toothpick to remove food stuck between teeth.  Well made, simple and bristle shaping smartly done.</li>
    <li> Got this toothbrush on time it is exactly like described.</li>
    <li> Great product. Good value.</li>
    <li> I do floss once a day, but the second time I brush I follow with the sulcabrush.  I think it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Works very well -- a good piece of dental equipment for working with tooth pockets</li>
    <li> These things work great to get in the back areas where the tooth meets the gum line, where a brush won&#x27;t fit.</li>
    <li> Neat brush for cleaning near gum line, but not that much different than a toothbrush.  Certainly does not get between teeth like floss, so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s doing any good.</li>
    <li> Great oral device that provides cleaning and massaging of gum areas. Two tip angles provide access to easy and difficult areas.</li>
    <li> it was okbut brush was hard for me</li>
    <li> This handle lasts forever. I still have the original one that I bought years ago.  I purchased new handles and replacement brushes for other members of my family, and just replacement brushes for myself, because my original handle is still in great shape.</li>
    <li> Well designed for cleaning teeth - there is no substitute. Reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> This is the ultimate way of keeping your teeth and gums in great shape.  My dentist has always recommended this.  I purchased this online because the price was better than purchasing one through my dentist.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a full lengh sulcabrush.  For some reason none of the stores around me carry any so I ordered it from amazon.  It arrived really quickly. The one I got was orange.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Registered Dental Hygienist. One of the best little inventions in the dental world--IF you know how to use it properly.  Never see it sold in stores.</li>
    <li> This was so wonderful, I ordered some for other family members. Ever get popcorn stuck behind the last molar? This baby will find it. You can almost get away with not flossing - not that I would recommend that - it gets between teeth so well.</li>
    <li> USE THIS EVERY DAY.  THE ANGLE OF THE BRUSH MAKES THE AWKWARD BUSINESS OF BRUSHING THE BACKS OF YOUR TEETH EASIER.</li>
    <li> Perfect for cleaning around gum lines-helpful in preventing placque</li>
    <li> Package has arrived.  Thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist for cleaning my teeth where the gums have receded. Soft bristled, small brush head, allows fine control. Still tricky to get all the different angles the outside/inside ends are helpful.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much more than a regular toothbrush</li>
    <li> works exactly like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Sulcabrush for several years on the advice of a periodontist, and am very happy with it. My teeth are cleaner, my gums healthier, and my cleanings easier and less frequent (every 6 mos. instead of every 4 mos.). Highly recommended.</li>
