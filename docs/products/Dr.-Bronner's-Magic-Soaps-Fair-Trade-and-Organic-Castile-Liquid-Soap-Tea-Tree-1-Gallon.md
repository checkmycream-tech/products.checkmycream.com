      <li>Love this for all sorts of reasons!</li>

      <li>in comparing the ingredients, this had some pretty impressive things in it...</li>
      <li>As their own literature indicates, this is a: vegetable oil-based soap, versus animal (tallow) fat-based soap.</li>
      <li>I no longer keep one kind of soap for my face and another for my body in the shower....</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s cost effective as well.</li>
      <li>Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps are absolutely the best.  </li>
      <li>but I do like the soap itself, its really nice.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how effective this soap was.  </li>

      <li>/&gt;This also is great to clean things you want to sanitize.</li>
      <li>I use this soap to make my own hand soap, the foaming kind, works best with 3 young kids!</li>
      <li>Good, strong tea tree oil aroma and lathers nicely.  </li>
      <li>Tea tree has natural antibacterial properties, so it makes perfect sense to use this one for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but the odor was so refreshing.  </li>

      <li>I love all of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s  products and this soap is no exception.</li>
      <li>Love Dr. B&#x27;s tea tree soap.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>do wish it was a bit thicker to stay on my washcloth better with a squirt from my dispenser</li>
      <li>, I feel even better.</li>
      <li>I love Dr. Bronner soap.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s healthy and biodegradable, and its made from plants instead of petroleum.  </li>
      <li>Always love Dr. Bronners.</li>
      <li>and i really liked how clean it got my skin with no itchy feeling after taking a shower.</li>
      <li>All are gentle and effective and have wonderful natural scents.</li>
      <li>soap is &amp;#34;Tea Tree&amp;#34;, so be aware it does not smell as good as the peppermint or lavender soaps, but it&#x27;s not supposed to.  </li>
      <li>This is a pretty good deal per ounce.</li>
      <li>bottle I got from the Vitamin Shoppe for $15 plus $1 shipping, which is also a pretty good deal.</li>
      <li>And as an anti-fungal agent, it proves more effective in fighting a wider spectrum of organic infectious agents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Diluted with distilled water in a foaming pump bottle, this has been our primary body soap for more than a year, and I&#x27;m about to order another gallon.</li>
      <li>always with the Bronner&#x27;s soaps, great foam, really cleans well, and rinses off quick.  </li>
      <li>I swear by this soap now, it makes cleaning easy and quicker.</li>
      <li>The smell is strong but after reading about the anti microbial and anti-fungal properties of tea tree oil</li>
      <li>recently discovered a great use for the tea tree... washing the inside of sandals.  </li>
      <li>Take it from me, a genuinely obsessive compulsive germaphobe - once you try Bronners (I recommend peppermint for all purpose use)</li>
      <li>There is also hemp oil and other great things...but no parabens and sulfates that most soaps have</li>
      <li>it smells very fresh but does not linger on</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s really great if you workout and sweat or simply want to keep your kid&#x27;s hands clean.</li>
      <li>I received it quickly and in great condition, will definitely order again!</li>
      <li>I clean my iphone screen with a damp cloth with it and wipe off</li>
      <li>It will clean anything.</li>
      <li>, I clean my yoga mat, I clean the wood floor where my cat just decided to cough up a fur ball...</li>
      <li>the anti-bacterial properties truly clean</li>
      <li>if they walk across it then clean their paws by licking.the anti-bacterial properties</li>
      <li>truly clean</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll literally feel squeeky clean.</li>
      <li>if they walk across it then clean their paws by licking.</li>
      <li>I do feel really clean though.</li>
      <li>how clean it feels.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>The whole bathroom smells clean!</li>
      <li>Makes a good suds, and the bottle lasts a very long time!</li>
      <li>I rarely write product reviews but I am compelled to after using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil Soap.</li>
      <li>In fact, DHC makes an olive oil facial wash because of this that I also own.</li>
      <li>especially the peppermint kind.  </li>
      <li>I think it is worth it.</li>
      <li>Tree oil smells a bit like fresh pine...hard to describe...</li>
      <li>And I know I&#x27;m being healthy  since there&#x27;s no harsh chemicals in it</li>
      <li>Disinfecting is important to me, and most \\&quot;natural\\&quot; floor cleaning products I&#x27;ve found tend to fall short in that department.  </li>
      <li>From kitchen cleaner, to hand soap, to even shampoo/body wash, I depend on the gentle, yet powerful clean of this soap.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line, you will have better success avoiding a MRSA infection with this, than with the standard chemical hand cleaner!</li>
      <li>He said most of the guys in the class uses the same product.</li>
      <li>is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the tea tree type.  </li>
      <li>The anti-microbial,anti-fungal &amp; anti-bacterial aspect of the soap is really evident.</li>
      <li>I am planning to try it on my laundry and dishes as well and phase out the other kind.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve pretty much tried every scent they have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Leaves your skin clean, refreshing &amp; not a chemical heavy feeling.  </li>
      <li>\\&quot;Pure-</li>
      <li>very \\&quot;green\\&quot; product with containers made from recycled plastic and nothing to throw away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>to much like paint remover.</li>
      <li>This product works very well for that purpose.</li>
      <li>Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile Soap is one of those rare products that works well, is natural and eco-friendly, and is produced by a conscionable company.</li>
      <li>This shampoo has worked really well for my itchy scalp.  </li>
      <li>Really helped with mosquito bites and maybe even repels them</li>
      <li>Tree smells very medicinal and has the benefits of antiseptic.  </li>
      <li>After extensive research I decided to try going more natural.  </li>
      <li>It cuts through oil very well but at the same time it is very easy to wash the soap off unlike regular dish detergents.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a green alternative to medication or harsh chemicals.  The tea tree oil has an earthy aroma which takes getting used to, but I know my skin is cleaner than clean and doesn&#x27;t have that dry, drawing feeling of dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My regular personal cleanser is the castile soap with peppermint for bathing, shampooing, etc., but I will use the tea tree oil blend if I want to be hygienic.</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Bronner soap.  They make me feel good, especially the peppermint kind.  And I know I&#x27;m being healthy  since there&#x27;s no harsh chemicals in it, I feel even better.</li>
    <li> n all honesty I bought this because I was looking for the Jason Tea Tree oil soap and this kept coming up on the search engine with really great reviews and, in comparing the ingredients, this had some pretty impressive things in it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, all the ingredients in it that CAN be organic are. Tea Tree oil has been used for ages as it&#x27;s a natural bacteria killer so it&#x27;s really great if you workout and sweat or simply want to keep your kid&#x27;s hands clean. It&#x27;s also used by homeopathic docs as an acne cure because of its antibacterial properties. Olive oil is used in Italy as a facial wash because it binds to makeup etc and helps eliminate wrinkles. In fact, DHC makes an olive oil facial wash because of this that I also own. There is also hemp oil and other great things...but no parabens and sulfates that most soaps have and that are best avoided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will notice a difference immediately with this soap...you&#x27;ll literally feel squeeky clean. I no longer keep one kind of soap for my face and another for my body in the shower....this works great for both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tea Tree oil smells a bit like fresh pine...hard to describe...it smells very fresh but does not linger on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says on the bottle that you can get the container refilled at any store that sells this. I&#x27;m not sure how this works but I&#x27;m curious...that&#x27;s quite green. Obviously it won&#x27;t work on an internet site getting a refill, but apparently I can take it to any local store once I do run out if they sell the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it was a bit thicker to stay on my washcloth better with a squirt from my dispenser but it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very \\&quot;green\\&quot; product with containers made from recycled plastic and nothing to throw away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also is great to clean things you want to sanitize. I clean my iphone screen with a damp cloth with it and wipe off and it&#x27;s like new, I clean my yoga mat, I clean the wood floor where my cat just decided to cough up a fur ball...the anti-bacterial properties truly clean well yet the ingredients are not harmful for pet paws if they walk across it then clean their paws by licking.the anti-bacterial properties truly clean well yet the ingredients are not harmful for pet paws if they walk across it then clean their paws by licking.</li>
    <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile Soap is one of those rare products that works well, is natural and eco-friendly, and is produced by a conscionable company. As their own literature indicates, this is a: vegetable oil-based soap, versus animal (tallow) fat-based soap. \\&quot;Pure-Castile\\&quot; is now also your guarantee that what you are using is a real ecological and simple soap, not a complex blend of detergents with a higher ecological impact due to the waste stream during manufacture and slower biodegradability.</li>
    <li> Tea Tree oil based soap, while taking some time to get used to, provides superior protection against spreading germs. It gives the same protection of alcohol-based hand sterilizer. But with the added benefit of promoting natural immune system response. And as an anti-fungal agent, it proves more effective in fighting a wider spectrum of organic infectious agents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, you will have better success avoiding a MRSA infection with this, than with the standard chemical hand cleaner!</li>
    <li> the ordered item took awhile before it got ship out by the seller but over all i got my order in one piece no defect or damage. The item is as expected.</li>
    <li> I have used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile Soap for a few years now.  I use it for everything.  I even use it to brush my teeth when we are out of toothpaste.  From kitchen cleaner, to hand soap, to even shampoo/body wash, I depend on the gentle, yet powerful clean of this soap.  A little goes a LOOOOOOONNNNGGGG way.  So it&#x27;s cost effective as well.</li>
    <li> Dr. Bronners is the best soap that has ever been created. Take it from me, a genuinely obsessive compulsive germaphobe - once you try Bronners (I recommend peppermint for all purpose use) you will never want to go back to that toxic triclosan containing crap.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has worked really well for my itchy scalp.  I no longer have to use Head and Shoulders which can dry your hair.  I like that it is biodegradable.  I am planning to try it on my laundry and dishes as well and phase out the other kind.  They have it in the bulk bin of my local health food store, Nature Mart in Los Feliz (Los Angeles) for 4.99 pound, although you have to buy or bring a container.  I compared the sizes when I got home and figured I paid $10 or $12 for the same volume as the 32 oz. bottle I got from the Vitamin Shoppe for $15 plus $1 shipping, which is also a pretty good deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bronners castile soaps for over 20 years.  I&#x27;ve pretty much tried every scent they have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently discovered a great use for the tea tree... washing the inside of sandals.  Not only does it get those annoying \\&quot;toe marks\\&quot; off (with the use of an old toothbrush for scrubbing), but it leaves the sandals smelling very fresh.  Tea tree has natural antibacterial properties, so it makes perfect sense to use this one for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the tea tree for when I need a quick swish of the toilet bowl.  The whole bathroom smells clean!</li>
    <li> I have loved Dr. Bronners soap since I was a teenager.  It&#x27;s healthy and biodegradable, and its made from plants instead of petroleum.  My only complaint with this order is that when my gallon bottle was packed, they used too small of a box and bent the spout of the bottle to fit it in, so I lose some each time I pour it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen anyone mention this soap&#x27;s floor cleaning superpower yet... I&#x27;m surprised!  My 8 month old just began crawling, and I use this (very diluted) tea tree soap in a spray bottle with my Swiffer wetjet on our stained concrete flooring &amp; bathroom tile.  One of these days I&#x27;ll figure out how to hack the Swiffer&#x27;s bottle but I digress.  Disinfecting is important to me, and most \\&quot;natural\\&quot; floor cleaning products I&#x27;ve found tend to fall short in that department.  Tea tree being a natural anti-fungal also helps me to rest a bit easier since we don&#x27;t wear shoes inside.  THANK YOU DR. BRONNERS for giving this new mommy peace of mind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED 7/12/2012: This gallon bottle lasted *14 months* for my family of 3. Diluted with distilled water in a foaming pump bottle, this has been our primary body soap for more than a year, and I&#x27;m about to order another gallon. My husband and I use it exclusively to control our sensitive acne prone skin, and I even use it on our toddler. Seriously, I doubt I will ever buy another brand again!!</li>
    <li> I like it but I do not love it. the smell is awful. Its a smell you have to get use to. The soap is thin and glides on the skin into a foam, its very luxurious. If the smell was better I would buy again but its just not a good smell. It reminds me of a machine shop. maybe the lavender or the other smells are better but the tea tree is yucky but I do like the soap itself, its really nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this mainly to use to wash my hair. The prod. description said that I could use it for this purpose. Well, it does not work. The dandruff is still  there. Oh well, back to real shampoos.</li>
    <li> I rarely write product reviews but I am compelled to after using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil Soap. I have dealt with body odor the majority of my adult life. I have tried tons of different soaps that would seem to help only temporarily . I would sometimes take two showers a day and after sweating this &#x27;funk&#x27; smell would start to form in my groin. Frankly it was embarrassing! A couple of weeks ago I decided to end this so I did research on different soaps. The all natural aspect of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s was the original thing that brought me to the product but then doing further research on the benefits of Tea Tree Oil was what really sealed the deal for me. The anti-microbial,anti-fungal &amp; anti-bacterial aspect of the soap is really evident. I have used it daily for a week and that &#x27;funk&#x27; in my groin is completely gone. Even after a long day at work I get home and there is no odor. I&#x27;m completely impressed with this product, the people at Dr. Bronner&#x27;s have gained a life-long customer!</li>
    <li> Love Dr. B&#x27;s tea tree soap.</li>
    <li> Good, strong tea tree oil aroma and lathers nicely.  Would have preferred it to be a little thicker, thus four stars instead of five.  I use it in the shower for both hair and body.  Good, invigorating soap.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use exclusively for my face.  I have had bouts of mild adult acne all my adult life.  I&#x27;ve tried everything you can imagine from home remedies to store bought to infomercial.  Nothing worked.  After extensive research I decided to try going more natural.  Over a month of using this tea tree castile from Dr. Bonner&#x27;s with a tea tree astringent I made and a tea tree/almond oil moisturizer and I have not had a single pimple.  My roscea has calmed to near existent as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I turned my daughter on to this last week and she swears overnight her face cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping, decent price, GREAT product!</li>
    <li> Tea tree oil soap is wonderful.  Leaves your skin clean, refreshing &amp; not a chemical heavy feeling.  Your skin can actually breath after using this soap.  i have several of Dr.  Bronner&#x27;s soaps, lavendar, almond &amp; now tea tree----they are all great!@  Try them, once you do you&#x27;ll never go back to chemical soaps again.</li>
    <li> I started using Dr. Bronner soaps for myself and i really liked how clean it got my skin with no itchy feeling after taking a shower. Then I read about using it for dishes and floors. It cuts through oil very well but at the same time it is very easy to wash the soap off unlike regular dish detergents. It leaves no slippery residue. Even on the floor, it doesn&#x27;t leave a slippery, sticky film that is hard to mop up. I swear by this soap now, it makes cleaning easy and quicker. this 1 gallon usually lasts me about 3-6 months. The Tea Tree Oil is the best for dishes, it overpowers the food and oil smells and is still pleasant. Also the Tea tree oil version seams to cut oil the best.</li>
    <li> My children get rashes from regular hand soap. We have tried some other hand soaps that work nicely, but they are quite expensive with four children using them daily. We put Dr. Bronner&#x27;s in an old foaming hand soap bottle--about an inch or so--then fill the rest up with water. Makes a good suds, and the bottle lasts a very long time! They also use it in the bath. Our favorite is the almond scent, but this scent is okay. Slightly medicinal--smells just like what it says, tea tree.</li>
    <li> I love all of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s  products and this soap is no exception. I&#x27;m super fussy about the detergents and soaps I use; I don&#x27;t like harsh, unnatural ingredients in my soaps or in my food. The tea tree oil in this soap adds to its effectiveness. I use it  to wash my dogs and they have trouble with fleas and dry skin sometimes. This product works very well for that purpose. Try Bronner&#x27;s lavender soap as well. As with all things, the price has inflated and now I can&#x27;t buy it as often as I used to. I wish the price would come down a bit.</li>
    <li> The Tea Tree option of Castile&#x27;s liquid soaps is my favorite of all their choices! Helps to keep my skin a little bit more moisturized.</li>
    <li> Does not burn eyes, economical in a gallon, heals wounds quicker, skin is smoother after, hair can be hard to manage after</li>
    <li> The tea tree scent is no longer in the soap.  That was one of the reasons for purchasing it previously.  Two sisters, two brothers, a daughter, a friend and I have purchased it for years.  Not only did we like the way it cleaned but the odor was so refreshing.  My brother even groomed his horses with it.</li>
    <li> I am very with the castile soap base but not crazy about the tree oil aroma...to much like paint remover. We will continue to use the product but will order a different aroma.</li>
    <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps are absolutely the best.  All are multipurpose products.  I use the Tea Tree in the shower, Lavender in the bath, and Peppermint at the sink.  All are gentle and effective and have wonderful natural scents.</li>
    <li> I am never without this soap.  It will clean anything.</li>
    <li> I use this soap to make my own hand soap, the foaming kind, works best with 3 young kids! When I would purchase it before, it was around $15 for a small container, so I decided I would order a large container, seems expensive upfront, but is a wonderful value for the price! It will last quite a while too which is wonderful! It only take around 1/4 c. to 1 1/2 c. water to make the foaming soap so it will go a long way! I received it quickly and in great condition, will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> I use this soap everyday in the shower.  It has the tea tree scent which can be harsh smelling at first, but it rinses clean for me and I don&#x27;t notice any smell when I get out of the shower.  I do feel really clean though.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how effective this soap was.  It has replaced nearly all my cleaning reagents!  The smell is strong but after reading about the anti microbial and anti-fungal properties of tea tree oil I think it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Love this for all sorts of reasons! Keeps away foot cooties, heat rash, and lasts forever!</li>
    <li> Always love Dr. Bronners. Only soaps I buy anymore. This is a pretty good deal per ounce. Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Used the Eucalyptus and Orange citrus,&lt;br /&gt;my rankings&lt;br /&gt;Eucalyptus is still #1.&lt;br /&gt;Tea Tree a close second.&lt;br /&gt;Orange is third.&lt;br /&gt;Tea Tree smells very medicinal and has the benefits of antiseptic.  Really helped with mosquito bites and maybe even repels them a bit.&lt;br /&gt;As always with the Bronner&#x27;s soaps, great foam, really cleans well, and rinses off quick.  Uses way less water to keep clean!  (my favourite characteristic!)</li>
    <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps are great, I&#x27;ve been using them for about 15 years, at the sink and in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is &amp;#34;Tea Tree&amp;#34;, so be aware it does not smell as good as the peppermint or lavender soaps, but it&#x27;s not supposed to.  If you understand that, you will like it.  If you are are looking for a good smelling Bronner product, I would go with the peppermint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the tea tree type.  I prefer the peppermint over this... but all Dr Bronner&#x27;s products are great.</li>
    <li> Great price. Cleared up my skin I believe. Qualityyy product.</li>
    <li> Great product, my son uses this after his gym classes. He said most of the guys in the class uses the same product.</li>
    <li> been using for 40 years great product</li>
    <li> have used the product for several years. love the nature smell and how clean it feels. great value with the gallon bottle.</li>
