      <li>and I&#x27;m very happy that I did.  </li>
      <li>I know there is nothing fancy in the list of ingredients, and how wonderful that the basics have kept my skin in tip-top shape!  </li>
      <li>After almost 40 years of use I can honestly say that this is the BOMB!!  </li>
      <li>Not greasy at all, and smells great.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of this product!!!</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant smell and it&#x27;s not oily.</li>
      <li>but it smells nice, and the 2-pack is a great value.</li>
      <li>Olay - you make feeling a looking beautiful accessible to all women!</li>
      <li>I will be ordering this again, great &amp;#34;bang for your buck&amp;#34;.  :-)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to hear these things from strangers... because what reason do they have to be dishonest?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the most amazing thing in the world</li>
      <li>My wife and I use this and it is probably one of the best creams for the face these two old people have used.</li>
      <li>It feels much better that way.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not going to tell you that \\&quot;After using this Olay product, my wrinkles magically fell off</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t love it for your face?</li>
      <li>I love using this at night because I wake up with the softest, smoothest skin.  </li>
      <li>I have used Oil of Olay for more than 25 years.  </li>
      <li>you have experienced any oilyness from this, you are using too much of it.</li>
      <li>It just feels better and makes my skin look better.</li>
      <li>and it has a nice light scent.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>You should also call this an acne fighter because it did seem to make mine magically vanish.  </li>
      <li>I love the scent of Olay.  </li>
      <li>They have lovely skin for their age and they swore by the \\&quot;original\\&quot; Oil of Olay.  </li>
      <li>used with the original ivory soap your skin is hydrated, smooth and amazingly soft.&lt;br /&gt;Every day it gets better!</li>
      <li>Have always love this face lotion.  </li>
      <li>I love this light lotion.</li>
      <li>Love the light scent, I use it on my body as well.</li>
      <li>but I do have a pretty acute sense of smell</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has that classic lotion/creme smell with a touch of rose or something (not my favorite, but not unbearable).</li>
      <li>If the fragrance doesn&#x27;t bother you, then this would be a fine moisturizer.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>turned to my fiance and said, \\&quot;Lucky you!  </li>
      <li>Pleasant fragrance, leaves my face soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>She used this stuff every single day and had the most amazing skin!</li>
      <li>had no allergic reaction to the original Olay years ago.</li>
      <li>Its funny that all these years later I have now bought this many times for my own daughter-in-law and grand daughters...</li>
      <li>and now I look just like Halle Berry!\\&quot; because that wouldn&#x27;t be true.  </li>
      <li>I am now looking for a good unscented facial moisturizer</li>
      <li>When I was little, my Mommy used this and was and is still so beautiful.  </li>
      <li>It absorbed right into my skin and didn&#x27;t just sit there like those others.  </li>
      <li>It makes my face feel really soft, smooth and in a way clean feeling.</li>
      <li>You can tell because it will wash right off of your fingers after application with just water - no soap needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it hasn&#x27;t caused a single breakout so it must be magic!</li>
      <li>This is possibly the best I&#x27;ve used as far as facial</li>
      <li>Funny thing is, I&#x27;ve always gotten compliments on my hands</li>
      <li>Even my Dr. has asked me what I use on my face to keep it so smooth and young looking...</li>
      <li>I loveeee this sooooo much!</li>
      <li>Face feel softer after first use</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have wrinkles in the first place even though I&#x27;m 35.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok, I find that its a bit too thick for my face, so I mostly use it on my neck and upper chest, it works well, absorbs very quickly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it would work wonders on dry</li>
      <li>only con is the strong scent</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Maybe this Oil of Olay will actually do wonders for someone&#x27;s hands since it is made to create smooth skin.</li>
      <li>The bottle itself is very hygenic too.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say, but this did not do so good for me...</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is not the same as the original Olay I used to use years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true, there is a scent with this product, but after a short time it dissipates.  </li>
      <li>It smells nice and isn&#x27;t greasy, but it gave me small itchy bumps all over my face.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought this product on the recommendation of a couple of older acquaintances.  </li>
      <li>My mother-in-law bought me my very first bottle for my 20th Birthday.</li>
      <li>Of course my skin has changed and aged over 40 years but constant use of Oil Of Olay has certainly helped keep wrinkles away and keeps my face really smooth.</li>
      <li>I have a sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Besides the compliments (which never get old!), this has helped my skin feel so soft.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m in hopes the beauty of soft skin reflects on me when I reach 77.</li>
      <li>I have used this since I was 20 years old.</li>
      <li>[I sell houses, or at least I used to :-) ] .  </li>
      <li>Since buying this I really see a difference from using &amp;#34;all purpose&amp;#34; lotion and facial.</li>
      <li>My mother has used this for over 50 years and she has soft skin and doesn&#x27;t look her age.  </li>
      <li>I am in my early 40&#x27;s and people always think I am a lot</li>
      <li>I am now 60 years old.</li>
      <li>It leaves the skin soft to the touch.  </li>
      <li>Never heavy, oily, or greasy.  </li>
      <li>I also like to leave my skin a little damp with clean water before applying.  </li>
      <li>This classic beauty fluid has stood the test of time for a reason:  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The scent could be irritating to some, but personally I love it.  </li>
      <li>This pink and powder-fresh potion has kept the wrinkles at bay thus far and kept it so soft and well balanced.  </li>
      <li>it gave me a headache the first few times I used it</li>
      <li>Over the past two months, whenever I applied it to my face I also applied it to the back of my right hand.  </li>
      <li>It takes just a little to do your whole face and neck.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My wife and I use this and it is probably one of the best creams for the face these two old people have used. This has been past down from my mom.</li>
    <li> Love the light scent, I use it on my body as well. I am over 40, and I have been using this product for over ten years, and I have no new wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I loveeee this sooooo much! My skin feels like silk.&lt;br /&gt;The only con is the strong scent it&#x27;s like a mix between baby wipes and florals.....not a good fragrance.... it gave me a headache the first few times I used it but it hasn&#x27;t caused a single breakout so it must be magic!</li>
    <li> This classic beauty fluid has stood the test of time for a reason:  it works!  I know there is nothing fancy in the list of ingredients, and how wonderful that the basics have kept my skin in tip-top shape!  I&#x27;ve often been mistaken for being 10 years younger (it just happened a few weeks ago!) being carded to get a bottle of wine and the cashier was shocked at my age!  I went to a party and a girl remarked how I had no lines on my face then turned to my fiance and said, \\&quot;Lucky you!  When she&#x27;s 50 she&#x27;ll look 25!  She&#x27;s always going to look young!\\&quot;  It&#x27;s nice to hear these things from strangers... because what reason do they have to be dishonest?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the compliments (which never get old!), this has helped my skin feel so soft.  I&#x27;ve been using it on and off for years.  I have switched to high-end moisturizers only to return to this one.  And the price is delightful - so affordable.  The bottle itself is very hygenic too.  I love using this at night because I wake up with the softest, smoothest skin.  During the day, I do still use this, but because there is no SPF, I add a sunscreen on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent could be irritating to some, but personally I love it.  When I was little, my Mommy used this and was and is still so beautiful.  This pink and powder-fresh potion has kept the wrinkles at bay thus far and kept it so soft and well balanced.  Never heavy, oily, or greasy.  Thanks Olay - you make feeling a looking beautiful accessible to all women!</li>
    <li> I use this after a shower on my face and under make up ...I am in my early 40&#x27;s and people always think I am a lot younger!....woohoo....I am a huge fan of this product!!!</li>
    <li> used with the original ivory soap your skin is hydrated, smooth and amazingly soft.&lt;br /&gt;Every day it gets better! My mom died at age 84. She used this stuff every single day and had the most amazing skin! She still had men chasing her at age 84!</li>
    <li> I have used this since I was 20 years old. I am now 60 years old. Of course my skin has changed and aged over 40 years but constant use of Oil Of Olay has certainly helped keep wrinkles away and keeps my face really smooth. I only use it once a day in the evening after my shower. It takes just a little to do your whole face and neck. Even my Dr. has asked me what I use on my face to keep it so smooth and young looking...40 years of Oil of Olay is what I tell him. My mother-in-law bought me my very first bottle for my 20th Birthday. I used only to satisfy her. Its funny that all these years later I have now bought this many times for my own daughter-in-law and grand daughters...</li>
    <li> Face feel softer after first use</li>
    <li> Have always love this face lotion.  You always know what your getting!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say, but this did not do so good for me...I guess since I have oily skin. I&#x27;m sure it would work wonders on dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has that classic lotion/creme smell with a touch of rose or something (not my favorite, but not unbearable). Since my face does not love it, I just use it as regular hand lotion and it&#x27;s fine. Funny thing is, I&#x27;ve always gotten compliments on my hands and I&#x27;ve always lotioned them after washing. Maybe this Oil of Olay will actually do wonders for someone&#x27;s hands since it is made to create smooth skin. Don&#x27;t love it for your face? Don&#x27;t throw it away, just use it for your hands or feet.</li>
    <li> I have used Oil of Olay for more than 25 years.  During that time, I tried other products with less satisfactory results.  Even the expensive moisturizers do not provide the results that I find when I stick with Oil of Olay.  Pleasant fragrance, leaves my face soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> It smells nice and isn&#x27;t greasy, but it gave me small itchy bumps all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;Whenever my face got heated, it felt like my entire face was covered with prickles.&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed in this product.&lt;br /&gt;It is not the same as the original Olay I used to use years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I had no allergic reaction to the original Olay years ago.</li>
    <li> I used to use LA MER ...then the economy took a nosedive and my income whittled down to nothing [I sell houses, or at least I used to :-) ] .  I bought the Olay Fluid on a whim and I&#x27;m very happy that I did.  It&#x27;s true, there is a scent with this product, but after a short time it dissipates.  I&#x27;ve used the Olay for a few days and it works just as well as the high end product I was using in the past.  I will be ordering this again, great &amp;#34;bang for your buck&amp;#34;.  :-)</li>
    <li> I have been using Olay for years. I use the face wash, then toner then moisturizer and i get ENDLESS compliments on my skin. if only ppl knew i spent minimal amounts of money on this stuff. MUST HAVE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;take care of your skin ppl !</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It makes my face feel really soft, smooth and in a way clean feeling. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or like it is clogging my pores and it has a nice light scent. Since buying this I really see a difference from using &amp;#34;all purpose&amp;#34; lotion and facial. It just feels better and makes my skin look better.</li>
    <li> After almost 40 years of use I can honestly say that this is the BOMB!!  Yes, I&#x27;ve tried other products along the way...even the most expensive ones...and I always come back to Olay.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to give it a try.</li>
    <li> This lotion is so oily! It broke my skin out horribly after the first use. I have never had a reaction like this to any Olay products. But i think i will stick to using a Moisturizer instead of a lotion. If you have oily skin DO NOT BUY THIS LOTION!</li>
    <li> I love this light lotion. Not greasy at all, and smells great. It wont clog your pores.</li>
    <li> This is possibly the best I&#x27;ve used as far as facial moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to tell you that \\&quot;After using this Olay product, my wrinkles magically fell off and now I look just like Halle Berry!\\&quot; because that wouldn&#x27;t be true.  I don&#x27;t have wrinkles in the first place even though I&#x27;m 35. Maybe this will keep it that way?  I will say that  this stuff is definitely not greasy. It absorbed right into my skin and didn&#x27;t just sit there like those others.  You should also call this an acne fighter because it did seem to make mine magically vanish.  It usually takes me over a week or two to get rid of, but I put this stuff on when I first got it and then later on that night. I woke up in the morning and every little red bump I had on my face was gone. Nothing but smooth-pasty- flesh ,baby!&lt;br /&gt;If you have experienced any oilyness from this, you are using too much of it. You don&#x27;t need but a little dab and that little bit  really does go a long way.  I also like to leave my skin a little damp with clean water before applying.  It feels much better that way.&lt;br /&gt;  I will be using this again and trying out other Olay products in the future.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, I find that its a bit too thick for my face, so I mostly use it on my neck and upper chest, it works well, absorbs very quickly. It&#x27;s not the most amazing thing in the world but it smells nice, and the 2-pack is a great value.</li>
    <li> The actual size was smaller</li>
    <li> I love the scent of Olay.  It has a pleasant smell and it&#x27;s not oily. It leaves the skin soft to the touch.  My mother has used this for over 50 years and she has soft skin and doesn&#x27;t look her age.  She is 77 now and still uses this. I started using it and I&#x27;m in hopes the beauty of soft skin reflects on me when I reach 77.</li>
    <li> I have used it since I was twenty and now I am 62 and ppl say i dont look 50.</li>
    <li> I have a sensitive skin! This product was great! I will buy it again! And recommend!</li>
    <li> everything I expected</li>
    <li> I bought this product on the recommendation of a couple of older acquaintances.  They have lovely skin for their age and they swore by the \\&quot;original\\&quot; Oil of Olay.  (I&#x27;m no spring chicken either, so that was not a back-handed compliment of any sort.)  I will say that the product seems to work.  I have a little patch of dry skin between my eyebrows that disappeared when I used this lotion.  I also did a little experiment.  Over the past two months, whenever I applied it to my face I also applied it to the back of my right hand.  There is now a small but noticeable difference in the skin tone between the backs of my hands, with my right hand showing fewer small wrinkles.  This lotion is also not oily (although mineral oil and petrolatum are among its ingredients).  There may be something in it that irritated another reviewer&#x27;s skin, but it wasn&#x27;t excessive oil.  You can tell because it will wash right off of your fingers after application with just water - no soap needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I can&#x27;t get past is the fragrance.  If it were unscented I would probably give it a 5.  I am not allergic to any scents but I do have a pretty acute sense of smell and I just can&#x27;t stomach this one any longer.  I am now looking for a good unscented facial moisturizer and I plan to give away the second bottle of the two-pack I bought.  If the fragrance doesn&#x27;t bother you, then this would be a fine moisturizer.</li>
