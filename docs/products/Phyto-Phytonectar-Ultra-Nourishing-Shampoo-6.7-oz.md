<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I got a sample of this shampoo from Barneys and bought a bottle after trying it for a week.  This shampoo does not lather very much, and I end up using more shampoo than usual.  It is pricey but it works.  It comes in a metal bottle which is pretty until you drop it in the shower.  It also has a screw top, which is inconvenient when your hands are wet.  Four stars because of the packaging.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly 3C/4A Medium Coarse Natural hair. This stuff worked great and highly recommend it for all hair textures. I left my hair so soft and very shiny and smooth. My hair get really frizzy and this has changed the whole look of my hair. It&#x27;s expensive but a little goes a very long way. It lathers but doesn&#x27;t strip my hair too much and my hair feels extremely smooth and clean when I rinse. I followed the directions and left it on my hair for a few minutes after massaging it into my scalp and it worked miracles. My hair never looked or felt so good.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!  The scent is absolutely fabulous and although light, stays on your hair all day long.  The results are also great, with my hair feeling soft and looking much more nourished.  I highly recommend this product to anyone, but especially those with dry, damaged hair.</li>
    <li> i like the way this shampoo leaves my hair.....it makes my hair feel full and clean.....nice addition to my shampoos......</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It leaves your hair feeling soft after shampooing. I think this product is great for any hair type that needs moisture.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft, manageable, shiny and NOT FRIZZY. I&#x27;ve tried so many products and nothing helps my frizzy hair. It doesn&#x27;t smell great, but rather have beautiful hair than have it smell like herbal essences.&lt;br /&gt;Must have!</li>
    <li> The shampoo does not have a consistency you expect from a shampoo, but makes hair feel silky.  I cannot vouch for how nourishing it is.  Perhaps I need to use it for a while to see actual results.  Overall it is Ok, but a bit pricy.</li>
    <li> Awesome shampoo for thin colored hair the product goes above and beyond expectations, yes I love it!</li>
    <li> And feels really rich.  I think these phyto shampoos are good for my fine thin damaged broken hair that I&#x27;m losing. I need to keep my scalp clean and they do a very nice job. They might be slightly drying but no more than ordinary. It&#x27;s hard to tell. I have this one and another I like them both</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo with a lovely fragrance.</li>
    <li> This shampoo turned my hair from straw to silk.  I had tried every conditioner known, but this shampoo made all the difference.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and will not use anything else.  Have been using this shampoo for a very long time.  Thanks Phyto</li>
    <li> Didnt work for my hair type, ways, dry and brittle :(  will look for something else</li>
    <li> good products for thinning hair</li>
    <li> My hair is really beatiful right now. I definitely recommend this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;The hair is light, shiny and gorgeous !</li>
    <li> Ever since I discovered this product several years ago, I keep going back to it.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but it seems to give my fine, thin hair bounce and shine, and also protects it from breakage.</li>
    <li> This is a great low lather shampoo.  I ordered this bottle months ago and just finished it.  It does not take much to clean your hair.  You just have to get used to the fact that it does not make much lather.  Love the smell and all of the Phyto shampoos are easy on my dye job.  Two thumbs up</li>
    <li> The scent of this shampoo is way too strong.  I really like the Phyto mousse but can&#x27;t get myself to use this.</li>
    <li> I recently went on a Caribbean cruise, I visited  the spa for a shampoo and blow-dry, and they used Phyto products on my hair and I love the way my hair felt.  I bought the conditioner at the ship but as soon as I got home I ordered the shampoo and I also enjoyed the savings.</li>
    <li> Its so smelly i had to throw it to the garbage.Also it left my hair feeling and looking more brittle and dry!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this shampoo for a long time. I hear it&#x27;s being replaced wih a different product which saddens me . I haven&#x27;t been pleased with anything else I&#x27;ve tried. This along with a blue shapoo is great for my gray  hair . . . better than anything I get at a beauty salon.</li>
    <li> A perfect shampoo for dry hair. I love Phyto products- they have saved my hair after a professional hair color disaster with Goldwell color. It has taken a while, but this really works - use phytokeratin to help repair and then a few days a week, use this to smooth your hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves hair moisturized but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all. Feels softer and fuller with regular use, though I do alternate it with another Phyto shampoo from time to time. It feels like it is going to be too conditioned when you first use it, but when hair dries, it&#x27;s shiny and very manageble and looks healthy. Very pleased with results.</li>
    <li> Use it daily - I buy it in the  extra big bottle now.  It is used at my beauty salon too.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for fine then fragile hair. You have to use it for a few shampoos before you notice the difference. The Phyto vitamins for the hair are wonderful, my hair is growing like wild fire.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo and the phyto serum for 18 months.  The phyto vitamins for 3 months.  I was almost ready to give up when it all started working.  Even my eyebrows, which were thinning too, are grown back thick.  I think my hair thinning had to do with stress, but the products worked for my daughter after she had a baby.  The products stopped my hair from falling out and then slowly it began to grow back in - worth every penny.  Now I use the serum a couple times a week, the  3-4 times a week and the vitamins everyday.  My hair is very healthy too.</li>
    <li> I love the Phyto products because they make my hair come out really nice. This is just a wonderful shampoo that keeps my hair at its best.</li>
    <li> Bought this as recommended in a men&#x27;s magazine (GQ I think). It does nothing more for me than, Pert from the drugstore. Worse, the bottle is small and the top must be screwed and unscrewed for each application. Unbelievably overpriced, as well.</li>
