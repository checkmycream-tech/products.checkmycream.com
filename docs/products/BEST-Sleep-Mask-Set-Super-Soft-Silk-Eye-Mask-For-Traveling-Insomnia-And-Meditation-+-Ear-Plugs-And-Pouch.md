<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Unless you are a child or small woman, this mask is worthless.</li>
    <li> I really like this sleep mask - the soft, satin feel against my face is so comforting, the velcro strap doesn&#x27;t get caught in my hair.......and I just love that there are little holders for the earplugs sewn into the strap. Overall, a good buy for a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
    <li> Ive been extremely pleased with the fit of this mask! It is not over bulky and actually covers exactly what i need to keep the light out :)</li>
    <li> I had never owned a sleep mask before, but now I can&#x27;t imagine life without one. This is the Sleep Mask I ordered and it is Wonderful. It is super soft and comfortable, it breathes well and doesn&#x27;t feel cumbersome. It&#x27;s an attractive Satin Black, so you feel kinda Fancy wearing it. It came with really high quality earplugs as well... Bonus, yay!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking about giving a couple of these as gifts. Thank You Comfort Dreams!</li>
    <li> Super soft and excellent quility sleep mask! My husband has veen using it sonce he has to sleep during some days and he said its like sleeping in the  middle of the night!</li>
    <li> I am a Sleep Mask fanatic and this Comfort-Dreams mask didn&#x27;t disappoint!  Beautiful black satin (satin is good for preventing eye wrinkles my friends!)  with a nice pouch for storage and travel.  My favorite part is the little ear plug holders.  This is the first mask I have bought that has this sweet feature.  My mask came with a set of plugs in the holder and an extra set which I really appreciated.  They fit nice and are very comfy.  You could sleep through a motorcycle rally (did that before while camping with a mask and ear plugs very similar to the Comfort-Dreams mask!) wearing this mask and plugs!  Every travel bag needs to have this in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wearing my mask when I have to get up early for work and the hubby wants to stay up watching annoying man shows, like Fast and Loud.  Can&#x27;t hear or see a thing except sweet dreams!  PS:  Hubby says I look cute in the mask!</li>
    <li> I work night shift and come home to 4 loud kids on the weekend...I love this product. The eye mask is soft and comfortable and the ear plugs are great! I love the spot which holds them too, so they won&#x27;t get lost. Great product!</li>
    <li> Beautiful satin sleep mask (comfort and great for your eyes!) that blocks light wonderfully!  I&#x27;m a light sleeper and I&#x27;ve taken this mask and ear plugs, in a great travel pouch, to a hotel (blocked out annoying hall noises and loud neighbors), camping (bocked animal noises, kids, other campers, and the rising sun/ambient light), used in my bedroom when my husband wants to stay up and watch TV (ugh!) and I need to get to sleep - sweet slumber - and a variety of other places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a wonderful job of blocking light, being comfortable to wear, and the ear plugs were surprisingly comfortable and blocked noise well.  I&#x27;ll be ordering a set for my husband, who travels for work, along with another set for my 7 year old who has used my mask and loves it.  :)</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be a bit thicker &amp;#34;pad-wise&amp;#34; than what it is.  If my overhead light is on, I can still peer through the bottom portion of this mask.  The ear buds do absolutely nothing to quiet the noise level, but then I&#x27;m sensitive to noise.  Just think I was expecting a bit more, especially with all the other rave reviews.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t match with my expectations. You are disturbed by light, it is very loose.</li>
    <li> not the quality I was hoping for.  Flimsy and easily slides off head during sleep.</li>
    <li> It works well. The eye piece is good and does the job but the ear plugs hardly work but i blame that on my apartment walls. Too thin. Great product!</li>
    <li> I am a nurse. I work long shifts overnight. When I finally get home I have the hardest time getting to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so important for me to sleep when I can which is why I was thrilled to find this sleep mask available during a promotional period  with an opportunity  to review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concept is simple- this mask is well designed to keep it completely dark in order to sleep any time of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this mask works better than darkening blinds. I slip my mask on with relaxing music and some lavender oil and I easily drift off to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this mask to all night shift workers. It makes sleeping in the day easy.</li>
    <li> I have been a 2-3 hour a night, kind of girl for some time. I work a semi-laborous job, and I&#x27;m a full time student, so my body and mind were not getting the rest I need, and it was not working out. This is the first mask I&#x27;ve tried to block out the light pollution of the neighborhood, or if the hubby wants to watch tv. After adjustment, the smallest driplet of photons can still leak in around my nose if the tv is on, but with my eyes closed I do not see it. Last night was my second night with the mask, I slept from 11pm to 9am. The night before I got about 7 hours. Its a miracle! This could seriously be a life changer!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like this or not.  I am a light sleeper and extra things near me can easily backfire and keep me awake but my alarm clock is my nemesis and I check it about 1000x a night so when I saw a promotion for this in exchange for an honest review I figured I would give it a try and give them my reality in the review.  Well color me surprised- the mask is so soft and lightweight I slept through the night without having to adjust it!!  I actually woke when my alarm went off and it took a moment for me to remember the mask was on, couldn&#x27;t quite figure out why it was so dark in my room!  Yay for good sleep!  Who knew the solution was so simple?</li>
    <li> I sleep better when I wear a sleep mask, so I use them regularly. When I was looking for a new one to replace my worn out one, I was given the opportunity to purchase this one at a discounted price so I could try it out. This is a nice, light weight sleeping mask. I&#x27;ve had one mask before that was super thick &amp; padded, but it was actually more difficult to sleep with. Thicker is not always better! One side is satin and the side that is against your eyes is a soft, velour type fabric. The straps are a nice, thick elastic band which is adjustable with Velcro. I&#x27;ve purchased many sleeping masks which have a thin elastic band that is not adjustable at all. Those eventually get stretched out before the rest of the mask is worn out. This mask does a pretty good job of blocking the majority of the light. A little light can get through the area of the mask around the nose. I don&#x27;t use ear plugs very often, but it&#x27;s nice to have them handy when I do need them, so I don&#x27;t have to fumble around my night stand looking for them.</li>
    <li> Got it for my wife. She loves it.</li>
    <li> Extremely cheap feeling on my face and uncomfortable, it was stiff on my face, and did a miserable job of laying onto the contours of my face. So much light came through.</li>
    <li> good price quick shipping</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll get right down to it...working full time while having three kids, this mama gets TIRED! I adore my naps!! When I am able to take one, I want to get to sleep faster so I can sleep longer!! Well, this sleep mask has been a lifesaver! In a thin, super soft satin on one side and velour on the other, this mask is very comfortable. The thinness of it helps it to stay in place when flipping over, unlike bulkier masks. Perhaps my favorite feature of it is the adjustable straps! I&#x27;m able to fit this right to my face, which blocks out the most light possible. There is only a tee tiny bit of light near the nose area that I&#x27;ve SLIGHTLY noticed. But then again, I take my naps in the day, so this wouldn&#x27;t be an issue at night. This mask comes with a handy carrying case as well as two sets of ear plugs. The ear plugs actually fit right into the mask strap, so you never have to worry about losing them. I&#x27;ll tell you what, my naps have improved 10 fold thanks to this mask!! While I did receive a coupon on this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, this in no way swayed my opinion. This is an A+ Product!! Super!!</li>
    <li> Love it.  Comfortable, effective, well-made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask weighs next to nothing and is lined with a soft velour type fabric - very comfortable!&lt;br /&gt;It is generous in width (7.5 inches) and covers my face completely.  The velcro-adjusted elastic strap guarantees just the right fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the light that it blocks, but be aware that there IS a tiny area just beside my nostrils that I cannot completely cover.  However, I have yet to find a comfortable mask that will.  It is kind of the trade-off, in my experience.  Maybe it is just the shape of my face, others report 100% blockage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask is very well made - the stitching is tight and accurate, the materials are first-rate. The elastic is wide and has great tension and is well-secured to the mask.  It comes with two pairs of earplugs and a storage bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered this mask at a promotional price and I am proud to stand by this assessment.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this for myself, BUT it was taken over by the ole boyfriend! He has trouble sleeping if there is any light whatsoever, so I grudgingly passed on my pretty mask. He said it was pretty light tight, and the ear plugs are a nice touch too. they can be stored on the mask itself, in a little holster. So this mask got me less complaining, which means I should give it eight stars! I got this during a promotional period, so I am super happy about that too! One more thing.....the strap is an adjustable Velcro, so it goes from very small to quite large ;). So it worked out well!</li>
    <li> The sleep mask was very comfortable to wear and the earplugs are a nice addition! I was on the fence about this product and then it was offered on promotion so I picked it up. This was perfect, I tried and so did my girlfriend and we both found it easy to wear and easy to block out the night. The earplugs she continues to use to block out my snoring. This may be the perfect addition to any situation where one person either has a different sleep schedule or likes to watch tv or read in bed.... I would suggest it</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be as comfortable as I had hoped.  I will be using it mostly for my trip to Europe in June.</li>
    <li> I thought it would of been more puffier, but besides that it works well. A moment I&#x27;m thinking probably this mask ain&#x27;t going to work well, minutes later I&#x27;m in a deep sleep lol</li>
    <li> I have never used a sleep mask but have used ear plugs for many years because my husband snores incessantly. However, because I tend to travel quite frequently, I find myself trying to catch a snooze at inopportune times. So, when I was offered the Comfort-Dreams Sleep Mask at a promotional discount I figured my problems were solved. I will have to say that the ear plugs that are included in the set leave something to be desired. They are not very pliable and, therefore do not conform to your inner ear very effectively - thus the 4 star rating. However, once I used the sleep mask for the first time I was in snooze heaven. Not only does it provide complete darkness, but it ensures no light by a small fabric shelf that extends over the bridge of the nose. Genius! Do they all do this? Well, to this newbie it is the best thing since sliced bread.</li>
    <li> I was fortunate to receive this during a promotional period right before a long trip. I first used this when I went on a red eye flight. This was perfect for that trip. I had worked all day then immediately after work left for the airport. I was exhausted. When I got on the plane I immediately grabbed this mask and the ear plugs so I could get some sleep on my 4 hour flight. This mask is very lightweight and thin which was perfect for me. The outside is made of a soft satin and the inside is made out of velour. It is very comfortable and soft on the eyes. I love the it had adjustable straps so that it wasn&#x27;t too tight or too loose. I have had other masks that didn&#x27;t have an adjustable band and if it didn&#x27;t fit I gave it away. It comes with two pairs of ear plugs which is awesome and there is a place to hold the earplugs on the band of the mask. I love this mask. My mom was jealous of me on our trip. She wishes she had had one. I will definitely be purchasing her one to go with her birthday basket. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for one of my best friends.  She always sleeps with a sleep mask and swears this one is the best she has owned by far.  She states that it is super comfortable and doesn&#x27;t move as she tosses and turns throughout the night.  I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for a great night sleep!!</li>
    <li> I am a sleep mask snob.  I have tried multiple different brands and types and can never seem to find one that fits well while keeping out the light while sleeping.  This mask is great.  It is both comfortable to wear while keeping the light out.  It stays on my face for the most part with minor movement which is to be expected.  I like the carrying case that comes with it for travel.  I plan to order more of this item when this one wears out.</li>
    <li> I received this mask 4 days ago and I have been using it every night.  My husband watches TV at night in the bedroom and this mask  is perfect for keeping light out.  I love the soft fabric on the inside by the nose you push it up towards your eyes and it blocks out all light.  I also like the adjustable straps this way if you have a headache you can put a little pressure on your head to make it feel better.  I also enjoyed the ear plugs that came with this and the handy ear plug holders on the strap.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. The Velcro straps are comfortable and come with two ear plug holders, which is very convenient. The mask is soft and fits perfectly.</li>
    <li> The velcro stretchy strap is a nice touch compared to a stretch-only strap. I was able to adjust it to be fairly loose because tight things give me a headache, but not so loose that it fell off while I shifted my head in the night. My husband likes to fall asleep watching tv and this mask completely blacks that out. The ear plugs are nice and squishy so they don&#x27;t feel gross in my ears, and the little loops for storing them on the strap during the day - PURE GENIUS!!</li>
    <li> I really wanted this item because my child will be spending approximately 3 weeks in the hospital. Because of her condition, her room will almost always be light and there will be constant beeping of monitoring equipment. I was happy to provide a review when I saw the opportunity available. I figured I would be able to give it a pretty good test run at home as I have four boys (so lack of noise, if I want to take a nap during the day, is very rarely an issue). The material is very soft and thick. It feels very comfortable on my face. The adjustable elastic allows for heads of almost any size to utilize the mask. I really like the earplugs, but it would&#x27;ve been nice if there was a small instructional slip with them. I would&#x27;ve given the mask 5 stars but I felt that there needs to be a bit more padding over the bridge of my nose to fully block out all light. It wasn&#x27;t enough light to bother me, but someone who wants complete darkness might have an issue with it. I really like the holder for the earplugs - super nifty way of keeping everything together. It&#x27;s also brilliant to include earplugs in the first place!!</li>
    <li> I was offered the chance to order this product as part of a promotion and I am so glad I did!  I suffer from severe sinus headaches and migraines.  The Comfort Dreams Sleep Mask with Earplugs has worked wonders to alleviate my light and sound sensitivity when I am suffering from one of these headaches.  It has made resting so much easier and caused my headaches to go away much sooner.  This has also been great for nights when I am having difficulty going to sleep.  I often cannot sleep without some type of background noise (i.e. TV), but the light from the TV will bother me and keep me awake.  No more is this a problem when I use the sleep mask.  I would highly recommend this sleep mask for a variety of purposes and would purchase again!</li>
    <li> I received the Comfort-Dreams Ultra Soft Satin Sleep Mask with Ear Buds at a great discounted rate which is why I decided to try them out. I am so glad that I did! I am a light sleeper and use earplugs every night and was thrilled to have these new ear plugs to try out, too! They worked out very well and stayed in my ears all night. The thin mask was a pleasure to use and has soft satin fabric on one side and a velour fabric on the other side and this mask stayed in place night after night. I have had masks before that twisted and turned and I was forever readjusting them. This one has an adjustable strap to make the fit as tight as your like. An added bonus the mask comes with a travel pouch.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice sleep mask, well made and comfortable.  I especially like the earplugs, as my husband snores sometimes, rather loudly.  I was offered a promotion deal to try this and I had fun doing so.  I had never seriously tired a sleep mask before and found this one to be beneficial when my husband wants to watch television before going to sleep.  The mask and the earplugs drown out the flashing lights and sounds making it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep. I especially like the small piece that drop down around your nose area. It is amazing how much more light that small addition blocks.  My daughter likes to sneak off with it some nights.  She said it makes her feel like a princess when she wears it to bed.  Maybe I need to get her one for her birthday or Christmas this year.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to be part of a trial promotion to test this mask out!! i got it in yesterday and had to give it a shot!! I have never used a sleep mask before but now I may be hooked!! It blocked out the alarm clock light, kitchen light, and morning light coming in the windows.&lt;br /&gt;Bonus! It comes with ear plugs!!! My husband is obnoxious with his snoring so this combo helped me to get an amazing night of sleep!! I&#x27;m about to put it on again for a little afternoon siesta!!!</li>
    <li> This item was received as part of a promotion. I was very impressed with the lightweight soft like satin material of the mask. It blocks out light well, especially around the bridge of your nose due to the special nose pad, and yet is not as bulky as other eyemasks comparable in quality. It comes with very comfortable ear plugs. Love that there is pockets for the ear plugs on the strap for storage. This Mask is great for travel as well. Very convenient! I will be purchasing two more of these for my husband and friend.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to try a sleep mask for a while now and was pretty excited to come across this one during a promotion.  The mask is well made and quite comfortable. I worried that it might be hard to get used to wearing a mask while sleeping but this one really didn&#x27;t take getting used to. The outer part is a smooth satin kind of fabric, and the inside part that touches your face is a very soft fabric. The mask has an adjustable velcro strap which makes it easily adjustable. On the actual strap is 2 loops which are to hold your earplugs. I think this is a nice and convenient feature. The mask comes with 2 pairs of earplugs as well. The earplugs are alright. I prefer a softer earplugs but that&#x27;s just personal preference.  Overall I am really enjoying this product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good sleep mask.</li>
    <li> I was asked to review this product as part of a promotional deal but all reviews are my own. I have a super hard time falling asleep at night not to mention my husband snores so bad. This product is great it blocks out all light and even comes with earplugs...huge plus. Its super soft and adjustable and it is just over comfortable to sleep in. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It was too tight around my head and felt restricting. Wanted to just cover my eyes instead of feeling like I had goggles on.</li>
    <li> The fit is better then expected.</li>
    <li> This eye mask is SO soft and the elastic on the back is adjustable, so it makes for a much better fit than some that I have had in the past.  The ear plugs are pretty standard ear plugs, so they probably work as well as any - but the eye mask even has a slot built in to store the ear plugs, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about one of them rolling away.  I really like this mask and would recommend or give as a gift!</li>
    <li> Pretty good.  I like the nose bridge - soft.  Main thing I like is that it somehow tucks up against my eyelids, keeping them closed, feeling very snug - never had one that did this before and I quite like!  The strap is a minor difficulty and I&#x27;m not sure of the difference exactly, but I have to put it over the ear because behind them is a little noticeable.  But generally very good and sleep very comfortably without light penetration - no problem.  Happy.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with how soft and smooth this sleep mask is- I also love the adjustable strap.  I have had sleep masks before that did not fit properly, and that makes such a difference!  These would be ideal for traveling!</li>
    <li> Soft against the eye lids and skin.  Nice little nose feature to keep any light from sneaking in.  Came with several pairs of ear plugs.  Nice product.</li>
    <li> these are really light and soft - they work really well and don&#x27;t feel heavy on the face. great product!</li>
    <li> This mask with earplugs is great for anyone who needs help shutting things down when they go to sleep.  If you are anything like me, you have trouble turning your brain off and ignoring the surrounding distractions when going to sleep.  The mask is a good fit for my head and the texture does not bother my skin at all.  I am very satisfied with this product and would recommend to others in need.</li>
    <li> My fiance and I both tried this mask. We have differently shaped noses/faces, and this sleep mask let in a fair amount of light for both of us. I bought it for bedroom use, but I probably won&#x27;t use it unless I&#x27;m travelling and get really desperate.</li>
    <li> Overall, I was not satisfied with this product. The mask doesn&#x27;t block out sunlight entering from the nose area, and the head strap keeps slipping from my head even when I adjust it. Also, the description stated that this sleep mask was contoured, but it seemed quite flat in the inside. My own mistake was in thinking that this mask had a satin interior. It actually has a satin outer shell with a plush interior. I probably will not return this product because of the inconvenience of repackaging and shipment.</li>
    <li> The part of the mask that touches your eyes is sooo soft.</li>
    <li> I work nights.  So I need to sleep during the day and I really love this sleep mask.  It&#x27;s soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  It&#x27;s easy to put on, and the velcro let me adjust to my comfort level and keeps it secure.  The little extra fabric at the bottom is great at keeping light out, and I love how it has a holder for my earplugs on the strap as well.  The earplugs that come with it are great and fit comfortably.  I definitely get better sleep now!</li>
    <li> I purchased this through a promotion with the intention of trying it out and reviewing it.  I&#x27;ve used a couple of sleep masks before so I do have a reference of comparison.  This one feels like good quality, it works well at blocking out the light, is comfortable and the included earplugs are a nice perk, if they work for you.  They wouldn&#x27;t stay in my ear so I can&#x27;t use them.  Two things I really like about this mask is the included storage bag and the adjustable velcro strap.  The velcro strap make it very easy to adjust to the perfect tension and the bag is nice for keeping the mask and earplugs together.  You could even put a pair of headphones in with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a good mask and a good deal for the cheap price.  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is the earplugs.  But that&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me because earplugs are cheap and plentiful.</li>
    <li> These helped me stay asleep. They&#x27;re adjustable which was nice, not just some size fits all. They came with ear plugs, and a cool little place to store them right on the band! You&#x27;ll never those them! sadly I couldn&#x27;t use them as I have a kid who wakes up at night and need to be able to hear him. When I saw there was a promotion for these I decided to try them. They worked great and did that they were supposed to! No complaints here!</li>
    <li> I love this sleep mask. I have never used one before and I am really sensitive to light when sleeping. So when I was offered to review this item honestly and given a discount I was all in! It is a very comfortable sleep mask, and keeps out the light. I like that it comes with ear plugs, but I didn&#x27;t try those out  while sleeping as I have children and need to be able to hear them. They appear to be standard ear plugs and when I put them in to test out comfort it was very comfortable and blocked out noise nicely.</li>
    <li> Received this as part of a promotion. Arrived exactly as described and I got a great nights rest :)</li>
    <li> This set has been great. I picked this up when offered as a promotional mainly to help me be able to sleep through the snoring :) &amp; the tv when I&#x27;m not the one watching in bed.  This set is serving its purpose. The eye mask does a good job of blocking out the light &amp; making it much easier for me to fall asleep &amp; the earplugs are an added bonus &amp; do a good job of decreasing the snoring sounds I hear. I don&#x27;t want all sound blocked as I have small children &amp; these do a good job of blocking enough snoring for me to be able to fall asleep w/o preventing me from being able to respond to a child who has entered the room. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> I travel often and through several different time zones. It tends to be a good 24 hours of flights before my arrival and needless to say at the end I&#x27;m like the walking dead. As an added bonus I get to travel with children and I&#x27;ve learned to try and sleep when they do. And wirh this sleep mask it makes it much easier to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It never fails that my children nod off before they turn the lights off on the plane or there is that one person sitting nearby who has a bright light on or doesn&#x27;t shut their window as the sun is shinning in while most in the cabin are asleep. I can easily control my need for utter darkness when I&#x27;m at home but on a plane I&#x27;m the victim of circumstance. Not anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fabric is nice and it isn&#x27;t scratchy at all. I do like the fit and how easy it is to adjust them on my head. As I tend to be in the most uncomfortable position on a plane my mask needs to stay put and this one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bonus of ear plugs was wonderful and I don&#x27;t loose them as they can be attached to the mask. Earplugs aren&#x27;t sound proof on a plane I don&#x27;t know anything that is. But at least sounds are dulled enough where I&#x27;m not annoyed by them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The carrying case for the mask makes it much easier for me to keep in my travel bag. Traveling with a family it&#x27;s easy to loose things in a bag so I was quite happy to be able to keep the mask and earplugs all together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your looking to have some darkness when you travel this is required purchase. I was happy to receive a discount for my purchase for my honest review.</li>
    <li> The Comfort-Dreams® Ultra-Soft Satin and Contoured SLEEP MASK is simply wonderful.  The velcro adjustable strap makes it quite comfortable and secure.  You will NOT be disappointed.  It perfectly blocks out all the light, comes with a lovely little silk pouch and the ear plugs are attached on the strap. How handy is that!  It will be perfect for traveling as well as at home.  I purchased this mask at a promotional price and more than happy to say I am delighted to give my 5 star rating.  I plan on giving some as gifts.</li>
    <li> This is such a great idea for the sleeping mask. The ear phone are a great addition. It helps with the noise that makes you lift that mask and look to see whats going on. I don&#x27;t know about you, but when I use my mask I hear everything and I get my sleep interupted. With the ear plugs, it doesn&#x27;t happen and the softness of the sleep mask doesn&#x27;t hurt either. I love this set and it works great. It is also made of strong material. I have to inform you that I did receive this mat at a dicount for my review, but I did a ho est review and I will be buying another one at regular price.</li>
    <li> This mask has made such a big difference in my husbands quality of sleep. He has health issues and has a problem sleeping and frequently takes naps during the day. He often wakes up because of the room being too bright but I have put off hanging dark curtains because I dont want my room to be like a dungeon. This has helped tremendously. It is made of really soft materials. There is an extra piece of fabric that lays across your nose to help block out the light even more. It is adjustable with velcro on the strap. I am very happy with my purchase! I received this product during a promotional period in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I work night shift and bought this so I could sleep during the day. The design is awful, there are two slots for ear plugs which makes it impossible to lay on that side comfortably.  The strap is adjustable which seems nice except even ok the smallest setting it&#x27;s too big and falling off, hence not blocking light. The loose velcro got stuck in my hair and I needed to cut out the hair to release it from the velcro, I&#x27;d you have long hair, watch out!!  has lots of high  reviews which is why I bought this. Major dissapointment for me it&#x27;s going back</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my fiancé who suffers from insomnia, and it defiantly helps him sleep better through the night! The mask is soft, light weight and breathable. The mask creates a total blackout environment for his sleep. The mask also came with foam earplugs for blocking out the noise. The straps are elastic with Velcro closure for a good fit, so I can borrow and use the mask too :)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to use during a promotion.  He loves it.  He would always complain about the light from my phone if I was on my phone doing anything.  This elminates that problem.  The ear plugs to cut out my snoring are a bonus.  He says its very comfortable and like the place to store the ear pkugs when he is does with out losing them</li>
    <li> When I was offered this product during a promotional period, I gave it a shot because I figured what did I have to lose? I&#x27;m a light sleeper, and I&#x27;m always open to anything that might help me get a better night&#x27;s sleep. This product helped my sleep tremendously. It was light weight and comfortable. Plus it was easy to adjust for a custom fit. It also stayed put the whole night! It helped blocked out extra light for me, which helped me to stay sleep. Combined with the bonus ear plugs (which helped drown out startling background noise) I had a much better night&#x27;s sleep. I recommend these to any light sleeper looking to improve their quality of sleep.</li>
    <li> I have been having a lot of trouble sleeping lately and I did not know what to do. I ran into this product and decided to try it out. I used it the first night I received it and I slept like a baby! I didn&#x27;t realize that I could I needed a sleeping mask but a sleeping mask does make a difference. I really like this sleeping mask because it is very soft and comfortable. The material is made of satin and is not of cheap. I am very happy with this product :)</li>
