      <li>Very easy to use.</li>
      <li>It was promptly delivered and the liquid is a very strong medicine.</li>
      <li>(I love me some Amazon)</li>
      <li>As many have already mentioned, we covered the mattress and frame.  </li>
      <li>Still seeing bugs but not as many as before.</li>
      <li>the more bugs we found.  </li>
      <li>The more we looked (under valances, window frames)</li>
      <li>We also find that we are able to easily catch flies</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is more cost effective to get the gallon, but we tried it with the 16oz bottle first to see if it would work for us.  </li>
      <li>Great product for handling complete mattress care, including pest-free assurance.  </li>
      <li>Was delivered very quickly and I would recommend anytime</li>
      <li>It kills almost all insects very quickly.</li>
      <li>It does have a strong organic smell but this smell does dissipate away very quickly.</li>
      <li>Easy for cleaning staff to use.</li>
      <li>We are flea and spider free granted we never had a huge problem with either</li>
      <li>So will not totally solve a bed bug problem but its great with a comprehensive treatment.</li>
      <li>Instant kill for bed bugs, works great.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s important to shake the bottle well before you use it to stir up the mixture</li>
      <li>but we felt it was worth it because it provides a sure kill without leaving compounds around that</li>
      <li>, she said it works fantastic.</li>
      <li>It has a very strong smell of alcohol/spirit so cover your nose if going to use it on a large space and everywhere.</li>
      <li>so I went on Amamzon to look at the feedbacks and was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>but this works perfectly and did not even use up the entire product before it was all completely done.</li>
      <li>It is a good product and it works, although be careful as the smell is really strong..</li>
      <li>I am familiar with this product and while there is no residual benefit, the instant kill of most insects is phenomenal.</li>
      <li>then calmly declared war on the bugs.</li>
      <li>Boy, was he right.</li>
      <li>It is right that the product kills bugs on just a touch.</li>
      <li>that there is a VERY strong alcohol smell for about ten minutes after you spray this product...</li>
      <li>More pleasant scent than other similar products we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>At least this is a good price and free shipping.</li>
      <li>Overall i am satisfied with this product</li>
      <li>but I wasn&#x27;t willing to do that.  </li>
      <li>all either in the hot dryer for 2 cycles or trash.</li>
      <li>The first prong involved spraying Steri-Fab around every crease/corner of my bed, floor and dressers.</li>
      <li>Does not have a residual effect, so consistently spray for about a week in all the places all the info says to spray</li>
      <li>Sterifab was one of the first products I tried because it sounded like a miracle cure....</li>
      <li>Very dissatisfied!</li>
      <li>The first thing I did was pitch the matresses out the window.</li>
      <li>Diatomaceous earth as an insect barrier around and underneath the walls seems like the best long-term solution especially if you are living in an apartment complex without control over your neighbors.    </li>
      <li>but once it&#x27;s dry, then it is okay.  </li>
      <li>I now have trashed my furniture (after slashing them and writing Bed bugs on them), sleep on a vinyl-covered large pillow in the living room, with double-sided tape all around...</li>
      <li>It arrived in no time and I was very grateful for that.  </li>
      <li>This product works really really well.  </li>
      <li>And this product really worked well in shor-term.</li>
      <li>really think it is irresponsible to promote this product as some sort of fix all for bed bugs.</li>
      <li>It really does what it says that it does.</li>
      <li>I had been told that only professional exterminator would be able to rid the infestation</li>
      <li>Although we replaced this later with a cedar oil mix product, this one is a top use item if you have a major issue to deal with and need it to work fast.</li>
      <li>I had so many sleepless nights due to bed bugs.</li>
      <li>only that were true.</li>
      <li>and I had high hopes.</li>
      <li>It has been nearly a year and no infestation has returned so it really did work.</li>
      <li>But I will be the last one to laugh, and it won&#x27;t be of madness.</li>
      <li>BTW, even though we opted for the more expensive covers they still ripped easily in contact with the frame.  </li>
      <li>I will highly recommend buying 2 rolls of double sided duct tape from Lowes (Blue Color, available in Painting section).</li>
      <li>Steri-Fab will kill them (only if they run through it while it is wet) and get them running for safe ground.</li>
      <li>It was first visible in an upper corner of the ceiling but had already begun spreading around the room.  </li>
      <li>Finally got a peaceful night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
      <li>The initial scent is a strong Ethyl alcohol smell that will dissipate and dry in about an hour.</li>
      <li>Works really well, but only on live bugs where they cluster or their eggs.</li>
      <li>I can certainly understand why these pests are such a problem.  </li>
      <li>We bought it because we had a certain pest problem... and I have only had to spray ONCE, and that took care of it.  </li>
      <li>Make sure that there is enough air when spraying this around your pets and little ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Buy the big size, put into a yard sprayer and spray your whole house and basement area.</li>
      <li>You will be surprised how efficent the sprayer works..</li>
      <li>You have to hit the bugs directly with alcohol to kill them, there is no residue kill in Steri-Fab.</li>
      <li>All this will cost you @100$    Professional service will cost you $500</li>
      <li>It will definitely hold you until you can get an exterminator to do the real job.</li>
      <li>Though I was first skeptical at the manufacturer&#x27;s claim that it is safe to use on mattresses but the product did not cause any issues even for my dad who has a really sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>And after I ruturend to my apartment, although I still can catch several bedbugs in my bed, the overall condition of the apartment turned better, and I slept well without bedbugs&#x27; bites for about half a month.</li>
      <li>I live in a small 1 bedroom apartment and yet used contents within a week--all in addition to taking apart, vacuuming and applying DE on sofa, chairs, mattress and boxspring (including encasing them with proper BB proof encasements and sealing the zipper exit with extra strong duct tape all around-</li>
      <li>it did not even come out or get lose when washed and dried in hot settings!)</li>
      <li>So far, I have ordered 2 gallons and have constantly sprayed on weekends for over 4 months now.</li>
      <li>After vaccuuming and washing everything in sight (and throwing away old bedding), we used SteriFab purchased from our local pest control guy.  </li>
      <li>it is now September 13, 2011 and not a single bed bug has been spotted.</li>
      <li>Sleeping with the heater on me so they might stay away due to the high heat.</li>
      <li>however I have to agree with other reviewers there is a high alcohol smell.</li>

    <li> Was delivered very quickly and I would recommend anytime</li>
    <li> bed bugs are tough. eventually, you have to literally crush them one by one. this product weakens them. it forces them to come out in the open. you can then crush them. this product works. i can guarantee that. it took two months. you have to be patient. bed bugs can go months without feeding. they are masters at hiding. this is what you are up against. this product weakens their survival instincts. five stars!</li>
    <li> I have not had this long enough to see the effects yet so I may come back and edit this review but I have seen a decrease in bugs however I have to agree with other reviewers there is a high alcohol smell.</li>
    <li> I had so many sleepless nights due to bed bugs. When I realized I bought this product on amazon &amp; as per the instructions I have tried to spray the liquid in the home &amp; cleaned some. It was awesome, it did a great job</li>
    <li> Our infestation showed up in one of my children&#x27;s bedrooms.  It was first visible in an upper corner of the ceiling but had already begun spreading around the room.  The more we looked (under valances, window frames) the more bugs we found.  Here&#x27;s what we did:  1. After vaccuuming and washing everything in sight (and throwing away old bedding), we used SteriFab purchased from our local pest control guy.  This is expensive stuff but we felt it was worth it because it provides a sure kill without leaving compounds around that might poison our kids later.  BTW, the pest control guy was already up to his ears in bedbug eradication and didn&#x27;t pressure us.  2. I used a hand-pumped garden sprayer to treat the obvious bugs.  Treated the mattress, springs and frame that were infested.  Sprayed around the baseboards as well.  All the picture frames in the room had infestations in them.  Did a lot of caulking of obvious cracks behind the outlet plates etc.  3. As many have already mentioned, we covered the mattress and frame.  BTW, even though we opted for the more expensive covers they still ripped easily in contact with the frame.  Duct tape works well in patching them.  4. After a couple of days of inspection/spraying/isolation, the big guys were gone but little guys kept showing up.  I bought diatomaceous earth and treated the areas in front and under the baseboard.  You have to get this dust under the baseboard as much as possible; some use dusting bottles but I rigged something up with an inflating pump that worked well.  This brought the population of hatchlings down dramatically.  The pest control guy suggested tearing up the carpet at the edges but I wasn&#x27;t willing to do that.  Also, if you take the outlet plates and run them through diatomaceous earth they pick up a good coating of it on the backside where it counts.  5. Kept seeing smaller guys above the doorways and realized that they were coming from cracks above the doorframes.  These cracks are not visible fromthe ground.  Sprayed them with SteriFab and (after they dried out) caulked those cracks.  Problem solved.      At this point (2 weeks out) the diatomaceous earth appears to be taking care of the really little ones, the ones that are still hatching out of eggs likely trapped in the carpeting or behind the walls.  From what I&#x27;ve read, baby bedbugs can continue hatching for up to a year so constant vigilance is the name of the game.  My son&#x27;s bed is separated from the walls by about 6 inches.  We bought small plastic dinner plates, put a thin layer of diatomaceous earth on them and slid them under the wheels of his bed. We&#x27;ll keep inspecting and washing his sheets regularly.    I can certainly understand why these pests are such a problem.  The eggs are microscopic and long-lived and you have to stay on top of it for at least a few weeks and for as long (or longer?) than a year. Diatomaceous earth as an insect barrier around and underneath the walls seems like the best long-term solution especially if you are living in an apartment complex without control over your neighbors.    Update, 2 weeks later.  Found a few underneath the covered box springs and sprayed them.  Couldn&#x27;t help but notice that there were quite a few crawling around on the INSIDE of the mattress cover.  Gross!  Hope they aren&#x27;t getting out somehow.    I wish I&#x27;d spread some diatomaceous earth in there as well.</li>
    <li> The liquid arrived within two days. It was promptly delivered and the liquid is a very strong medicine. It kills almost all insects very quickly. It does have a strong organic smell but this smell does dissipate away very quickly. Overall i am satisfied with this product</li>
    <li> Steri Fab is the best one to use if you have a bed bug infestation. I had bed bug issues for the last 2 years and spent hundreds of dollars for exterminators and throwing away infested mattresses and bedding materials. So far, I have ordered 2 gallons and have constantly sprayed on weekends for over 4 months now. Vacuumed the dead bugs and eggs regularly and the bed bugs are gone! Though I was first skeptical at the manufacturer&#x27;s claim that it is safe to use on mattresses but the product did not cause any issues even for my dad who has a really sensitive skin. Recommend this product (either gallon or the pint) for anyone who even think they have a bed bug issue.</li>
    <li> This product does help alot when you do have bedbugs. It really does what it says that it does. Used it along with the pronto bed bug spray. Still seeing bugs but not as many as before. Still using the spray and it seems to be working.</li>
    <li> had an insect infestation after visit to hotel that had infestation. I had been told that only professional exterminator would be able to rid the infestation but this works perfectly and did not even use up the entire product before it was all completely done. It has been nearly a year and no infestation has returned so it really did work. (I was told I might get rid of problem but it would return.. it hasn&#x27;t, not with this product).</li>
    <li> So I not only over paid for this product but then paid extra for 2 day shipping. Read the ingredients and discovered it is 80% rubbing alcohol and bug killer. So I went to a local store bought 90% alcohol and bed b gone mixed into sprayers and achieved the same results for 1/8 the cost. Read that its the rubbing alcohol that kills the bedbugs.</li>
    <li> When our exchange students bed became enfested with bed bugs I didn&#x27;t know what to to. The first thing I did was pitch the matresses out the window. Then I went to Lowes and bought a package of bedbug bombs.     Then I went on line and did some research on bedbugs. I kept seeing Steri-Fab come up on the search engine so I went on Amamzon to look at the feedbacks and was not disappointed. After reading the feedbacks i ordered a gallon of the stuff. Now there was a couple of other things i did as a result of my research. I bought zippered mattress covers for all the matresses and box springs. I also started spraying everything that didn&#x27;t move with Steri-Fab, and I am vacuuming everyday. I have not seen a Bedbug since. This is a once a week process for me and I think I will continue for at least 2 months</li>
    <li> It is a good product and it works, although be careful as the smell is really strong..</li>
    <li> Buy the big size, put into a yard sprayer and spray your whole house and basement area. We even spray outside around the hose and yard. I keep this gallon on hold all year. No bugs anywhere!!!</li>
    <li> I recently made the mistake of booking a room a budget motel and brought home some uninvited guests, bed bugs. I had no idea they had taken over my bedroom until spotting them creeping over one of my pillows. I FREAKED OUT...then calmly declared war on the bugs. I tried several sprays and bombs from other companies to no avail. The situation was driving me out of my mind and the thought of throwing money at a pest control company was even worse. I read the reviews for Steri-Fab on Amazon and decided to give it shot. There was a two-pronged attack to my method after clearing clothing, bedding and shoes from the room, I sealed every wooden crack and crevice I could find. The first prong involved spraying Steri-Fab around every crease/corner of my bed, floor and dressers. You will see them start running for cover. The second prong (you will need to follow the instructions for the bomb and wear a mask!) entails using a bed bug bomb (I used Raid). Steri-Fab will kill them (only if they run through it while it is wet) and get them running for safe ground. The bomb will effectively \\&quot;choke\\&quot; them to death in a sealed room. After ventilating, treat the same areas again with Steri-fab and continue to do so once every two days until you see no more bed bugs. Steri-Fab WORKS!!! I treated my home on August 15, 2011...it is now September 13, 2011 and not a single bed bug has been spotted. I&#x27;m keeping a gallon of this stuff on hand permanently to use in a pinch for emergencies.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, it did not work. Which is sad, because it isn&#x27;t cheap and I had high hopes. I live in a small 1 bedroom apartment and yet used contents within a week--all in addition to taking apart, vacuuming and applying DE on sofa, chairs, mattress and boxspring (including encasing them with proper BB proof encasements and sealing the zipper exit with extra strong duct tape all around-it did not even come out or get lose when washed and dried in hot settings!), vacuuming the entire house including cracks and outlets like a maniac (and applying Sterifab and DE, laundering EVERY piece of clothe I owe and drying them on high setting, opening remote controls, tv, etc and vacuuming... countless bags of trash (btw, throwing vacuum bag into plastic bag, sealing and immediately throwing everything out outside the apartment).... YOU NAME IT. Nothing has worked. NOTHING. I now have trashed my furniture (after slashing them and writing Bed bugs on them), sleep on a vinyl-covered large pillow in the living room, with double-sided tape all around... and I STILL GET BITTEN!!!!! Something HAS to work. HAS TO. But, this is not it. If you know it you can at least save the few hundred bucks us desperate folks spend trying to get rid of the problem, before they realize they need to run away. Naked, mind you. Barefoot, naked, and taking NOTHING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also did caulking. Opening outlets, vacuuming, DE, Sterifab. Purses, shoes, bedding, books....all either in the hot dryer for 2 cycles or trash. Double-taping legs of furniture, etc. Sleeping with the heater on me so they might stay away due to the high heat. Ha. They must be laughing. But I will be the last one to laugh, and it won&#x27;t be of madness. Something will work, they will die, and I will post it here so you too may be out of your misery.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product that does what the advertisement states it should do.  It is a reliable product that does not leave any residue.</li>
    <li> This product worked well with my bed bug problem. Save me the cost of having to spend thousands of dollars for an exterminator.</li>
    <li> This product works really really well.  We bought it because we had a certain pest problem... and I have only had to spray ONCE, and that took care of it.  Note that I sprayed the bed, under the bed, the board, behind the cabinets, the floor, the rugs, and even the bathroom.  Mites that come from pigeons stand no chance with this either (we found out by accident on this one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is more cost effective to get the gallon, but we tried it with the 16oz bottle first to see if it would work for us.  We also find that we are able to easily catch flies (it is like they are flying drunk) when we spray this product (and that was also unintentional).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that there is a VERY strong alcohol smell for about ten minutes after you spray this product... but once it&#x27;s dry, then it is okay.  Make sure that there is enough air when spraying this around your pets and little ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I wish that I would have known about this product earlier on in my pest issues. (I love me some Amazon)</li>
    <li> It is what it is and it works as stated.</li>
    <li> I am freak when it comes to bugs.  We protect our house, animals and yard.  We bought this to spray on the beds, furniture and rugs before we left on vacation.  It worked GREAT!  We are flea and spider free granted we never had a huge problem with either but like I said before I don&#x27;t want to see NO BUGS ... not even one!  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product when my apartment sufferd from the bedbug.&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed this product on the curtain, floor and my wood bed, and then closed the window and waited outside of the apartment for about 5 hours. And after I ruturend to my apartment, although I still can catch several bedbugs in my bed, the overall condition of the apartment turned better, and I slept well without bedbugs&#x27; bites for about half a month. This product is effective.&lt;br /&gt;And I believe the reason why bedbugs staged a comeback was that they have adapted to this product. As far as I know, there is no effective product that can remove bedbugs completely at once. And this product really worked well in shor-term.</li>
    <li> Used this extensively to get rid of an severe infestation I had.     I used Steri-Fab extensively on my mattress and carpet.  Use Pronto for Wood crevices and cracks. Then spray Steri-Fab all over the mattress, especially along the seams .. since thats where those bloodsuckers hide.   I will highly recommend buying 2 rolls of double sided duct tape from Lowes (Blue Color, available in Painting section). Use this to \\&quot;Quarantine\\&quot; your infection by applying on all exits and entrances to the room under infestation. Apply the tape to the side of the bed as well. The tape will catch the bugs that will try to relocate after spraying of steri-fab. Keep the tape for atleast 15-20 days. Reapply if it peals and use steri-fab atealst once every 15 days, an use it judiciously. You will be surprised how efficent the sprayer works.. I hardly used 1/4 Gal to fight a sizable infestation!  Following is list of items you will need to eliminate bed bugs -  Steri-Fab - 1 Gal  Pronto - 2 Cans  Duct Tape - 2 Rolls  Spray Bottle - 1     All this will cost you @100$    Professional service will cost you $500 + ..</li>
    <li> For a dangerous pesticide like this it absolutely should come labeled. I sort of believe it is the right stuff but am seriously disappointed that it had absolutely no label on it. Just plain white container.</li>
    <li> excellent product.  Finally got a peaceful night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s kind of expensive, but it works! I sleep with my 3 dogs and cat in my bed, so I&#x27;m always cautious about any possible bugs I might get involved with. I use this spray each time I change my sheets, I spray the mattress, the bed skirt, draperies, blankets, and just about any fabric in my home. The initial scent is a strong Ethyl alcohol smell that will dissipate and dry in about an hour. And it&#x27;s important to shake the bottle well before you use it to stir up the mixture so you get the maximum benefits of this product. This also helps with fleas, bed bugs, and Morgellon sufferers too.</li>
    <li> One of the most versatile products ever!  I will always keep a Steri-Fab jug in my house!  GREAT INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH AND HAS MANY USES!</li>
    <li> Great product for handling complete mattress care, including pest-free assurance.  Easy for cleaning staff to use. More pleasant scent than other similar products we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> The products works and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> this is my 4th. gallon of Steri-Fab, and it is excellent. I does what it says it will do, and that is what I want. The company is courteous and prompt.</li>
    <li> Oh My god, stop recommending this product for bed-bugs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$42 a gallon, and the main ingredient that kills bed bugs is the IsoPropyl alcohol, which you can buy for a few dollars a gallon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I manage over a hundred apartments, I have dealt with bed bugs since they appeared a decade ago. Sterifab was one of the first products I tried because it sounded like a miracle cure....\\&quot;just spray it every where and it kills everything with no residue!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only that were true. You have to hit the bugs directly with alcohol to kill them, there is no residue kill in Steri-Fab. NONE AT ALL.  And you cannot spray this inside your mattress and box springs, and it doesnt kill eggs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really think it is irresponsible to promote this product as some sort of fix all for bed bugs.</li>
    <li> I am familiar with this product and while there is no residual benefit, the instant kill of most insects is phenomenal. Great for bedding,cleaning counters, tables and floors.</li>
    <li> This one actually works and keeps killing for days. Although we replaced this later with a cedar oil mix product, this one is a top use item if you have a major issue to deal with and need it to work fast.</li>
    <li> I used Steri-fab to get rid of my bed bugs problem. This was recommended by the exterminator. Boy, was he right. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with those suckers since.  I love it!!! Very easy to use. Just spray on your shoes and clothes as soon as you enter back to your house. You can also use it to spray it on your bed or carpet. It&#x27;s very resourceful. The seller was excellent. It arrived in no time and I was very grateful for that.  Sorry it took me this long to respond. I will definitely do business with them again.</li>
    <li> great for bed bugs on fabrics</li>
    <li> I USE IT FOR MY BUSINESS.  WORKS GREAT ON ALL FURNITURE.  EVERYONE SHOULD USE THIS PRODUCT.  KILLS EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING.</li>
    <li> It works for a while. You have to keep following up with the sprays everyday for at least a week. Always ventilate and give time in between the sprays. It will definitely hold you until you can get an exterminator to do the real job. Not recommended for an infestation problem.</li>
    <li> Instant kill for bed bugs, works great. Sen&#x27;t to a relative in another state that had a bed bug issue, she said it works fantastic. Just keep in mind that this does not form a long term barrier, its an instant kill for when you find the little buggers.</li>
    <li> the state makes us buy this stuff. At least this is a good price and free shipping.</li>
    <li> Works well all bed bugs gone away just sprayed everywhere all your cabinets carpet. Also I used for my car just in case but don&#x27;t forger leave yours windows open for few hours. Also company who did exterminated for me used the same stuff. Bed Bugs it big problem in NYC</li>
    <li> It is right that the product kills bugs on just a touch. It has a very strong smell of alcohol/spirit so cover your nose if going to use it on a large space and everywhere.</li>
    <li> Works really well, but only on live bugs where they cluster or their eggs. Does not have a residual effect, so consistently spray for about a week in all the places all the info says to spray and you should have good results.</li>
    <li> great you can use this on all surfaces but you still need a real strong perimiter spray like Phantom.  So will not totally solve a bed bug problem but its great with a comprehensive treatment.</li>
    <li> Did not help at all!  Very dissatisfied!</li>
    <li> Great stuff used it for mold in a basement and it worked great.</li>
