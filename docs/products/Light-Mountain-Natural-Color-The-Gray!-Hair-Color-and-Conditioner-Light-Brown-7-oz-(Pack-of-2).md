      <li>I LOVE THIS.</li>
      <li>I have started to get more gray and</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Did I say I love it?  </li>
      <li>I think they could provide more gloves for each of the steps and the tools to mix up the color.</li>
      <li>I have used this for many years.  </li>
      <li>There where toooo many reviews to go thru.</li>
      <li>I should be the spokesperson and give lessons because I am so pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>The gray will take on the color of the henna more than your brown/black, etc.</li>
      <li>No grays left and a wonderful brown color.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad i tried it :)</li>
      <li>is more time-consuming.</li>
      <li>it starts to fade...thus leaving lots more gray hair showing since all the out-growth is visible.  </li>
      <li>glad I stuck with this product.</li>
      <li>I am so impressed with this and so over joyed that I don&#x27;t have to give into grey now.</li>
      <li>Easy solution of keeping more product on hand and just doing it when the gray starts to show.  </li>
      <li>Very good stuff for people that have almost all white hair.</li>
      <li>I also spread old towels on the sink and floor and cut openings on a trash bag to wear myself as another reviewer suggested - great tip as it does drip and get everywhere.</li>
      <li>just make sure you have some free time.</li>
      <li>I colored my hair for years with an ammonia-free hair product I bought at Whole Foods Market, with good results.</li>
      <li>Easy to prepare, no chemicals and complements every time.  </li>
      <li>2 steps easy to follow</li>
      <li>It looks much more natural than highlighting, and it&#x27;s actually good for your hair, as opposed to hair dye.</li>
      <li>My hair is super healthy and shiny.</li>
      <li>Another positive is that the product does seem to cover better, and may be more long-lasting.  </li>
      <li>Hair Color &amp; Conditioner, Light Brown, 7 oz</li>
      <li>Initally, it takes some getting used to preparing the Light Mountain</li>
      <li>The Light Brown color.  </li>
      <li>it looks fantastic and used no chemicals.</li>
      <li>My hair is so much softer, shinier, and not frizzy anymore!!!</li>
      <li>(this was my first time using) and decided this brand would be my safest and most effective bet, as I wanted more brown than red tones.</li>
      <li>It completely covered my grey, turned them to either golden or reddish brown highlights and the rest of my hair is a beautiful warm, rich brown color with glimmers of auburn in light.</li>
      <li>The henna smells like hay for a day or so, so don&#x27;t use it right before you go out on a date!    </li>
      <li>I never had an allergic reaction to Loving Care and as far as I know</li>
      <li>I use this because its super clean.  </li>
      <li>first she was concerned about or mineral rich</li>
      <li>The second step I mixed yogurt, egg and hot brewed coffee to the dye and results came out perfect.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried this yet, but just wanted first timers to beware!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 53 and my light brown soft, fine hair had turned into course, curly gray.</li>
      <li>It did work, and looks much more natural than dye.</li>
      <li>Covered my gray with golden highlights.</li>
      <li>well worth it.</li>
      <li>I read up on henna, the only real alternative I found, and the claims were good.</li>
      <li>The color did turn out alright and looked natural, but it is more of a mousy medium brown.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth your time.  </li>
      <li>It does take some preparation before you can use this product, but it&#x27;s well worth it.  </li>
      <li>However, my hair was becoming dry and frizzy from too many years of doing so.</li>
      <li>The first step of this process does not seem as gritty and washed out more easily, which is a positive.  </li>
      <li>It also took out some of the dryness and is holding up more than several weeks and still no signs of having to re do the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been using Light Mountain Natural Hair Color for years and have given that a 5-star review, but this is the first time I have tried Color the Gray.  </li>
      <li>Most likely I will give it another try.  </li>
      <li>I think it may get better the next time i use it though.</li>
      <li>I naturally have medium to light mousy brown hair,</li>
      <li>I do want red highlights, unlike many people and have found a way to do it.  </li>
      <li>but after the first time, you know what to do.</li>
      <li>It has been just under two weeks since I used the product, and at this point the one-step Light Mountain Natural Henna would have started to lose color at the front where my gray is.  </li>
      <li>B001ET7LNA Light Mountain Natural Color</li>
      <li>It coats the outside of your hair with the color so after so many washes...</li>
      <li>So, I agree with the work being well worth the NO Chemicals, but I didn&#x27;t realize I would need to do so much work.  </li>
      <li>Put the henna in a glass or ceramic bowl, add hot water.    </li>
      <li>I have used twice 7-8 weeks apart and both times the results were consistent.  </li>
      <li>Unlike other hair coloring systems, you will have to do your own boiling and mixing.  </li>
      <li>having no other choice, i bought the light brown, just received it today and couldnt wait to use it.</li>
      <li>tub facet first really helped.</li>
      <li>After becoming increasingly itchy after my last hair dye, I decided to give this botanical based non chemical product a try.  </li>
      <li>My hair is in such great shape, and is the same exact color as I used to get with regular color.</li>
      <li>So...it was messy but kind of therapeutic coating my hair with the &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; and after I initially mixed the first part (I only used warm water in both mixes) and let it cure for 2 hours I began the process.</li>
      <li>Will continue to look to this product as I am extremely pleased with the results even if the process is a little (okay a lot) different than what I was used to.  </li>
      <li>My body thanks me.</li>
      <li>I have African-American hair and found it to be very drying</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product makes my hair feel healthy--I use coffee brewed with distilled water to cut back on the red.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because it&#x27;s supposed to be a lot more natural than other haircolors. I agree with some of the other reviewers, this was very time consuming and messy. I think it may get better the next time i use it though. The instructions say it comes with everything you need. Not really, you need the special water and containers that aren&#x27;t metal. I think they could provide more gloves for each of the steps and the tools to mix up the color. What&#x27;s included is 1 pair of gloves, 1 cap, and 2 packets of powder color. Also, I read on another website that you need to do the strand test every time, since each batch of henna may have a different color. The color did turn out alright and looked natural, but it is more of a mousy medium brown. I had added nutmeg like the instructions said and I did not find that it warmed the color.</li>
    <li> I have a terrrible allergy to hair die and have used henna in the past but this really works.  2 step process really ends up covering those stubborn grays.  It&#x27;s messy, and heavy but it&#x27;s worth your time.  If you&#x27;ve used Henna in the past but got sketchy results thjis is the stuff for you!</li>
    <li> I started using this product when I stumbled upon \\&quot;Skin Deep: Cosmetic Safety Reviews\\&quot; at [...]. I was astonished at the number of products I normally use that contain chemicals known to causes serious disease. This database rates products according to their overall health safety. The hair coloring products section is here (starting with the SAFEST): [...]?category&#x3D;hair+color+and+bleaching    Just to give one random example--Clairol products are given hazard ratings of 4-10 (10 being the most harmful). Ingredients used by this brand have been proven to cause:  --Cancer,  --Developmental/reproductive toxicity, and  --Allergies/immunotoxicity    Other concerns for ingredients used by this brand are:  --Neurotoxicity,   --Endocrine disruption,   --Persistence and bioaccumulation,   --Organ system toxicity (non-reproductive),   --Irritation (skin, eyes, or lungs),   --Enhanced skin absorption,   --Contamination concerns,   --Occupational hazards,   --Biochemical or cellular level changes, and others    Ingredients used by this brand are also legally subject to \\&quot;Violations, restrictions &amp; warnings\\&quot;.    This is NOT to single Clairol out! I chose that brand completely at random. NOTE:     \\&quot;A 2008 study of over 10,000 people published in the American Journal of Epidemiology (4,461 NHL patients and 5,799 controls) concluded the following:    &#x27;In summary, the results from this large InterLymph-based pooled analysis indicate that personal use of hair dye may play a role in the risk of NHL [Non-Hodgkin&#x27;s Lymphoma], particularly for follicular lymphoma and CLL/SLL. Our study also indicates that although the risk associated with personal hair-dye use was observed mainly among women who started using hair dyes before 1980, the risk was not limited to those women. Future studies are needed to examine the risk of NHL by time period of hair-dye use and by genetic susceptibility.&#x27;\\&quot;  [...]      See also:    Nation Institute of Environmental Health Sciences:  \\&quot;Genetic Connection In LinkBetween Permanent Hair Dye Use And Bladder Cancer Risk\\&quot;  [...]      Food and Drug Administration:  \\&quot;Heading Off Hair-Care Disasters: Use Caution With Relaxers and Dyes\\&quot;  [...]      THIS IS SERIOUS STUFF. IS IT WORTH YOUR LIFE TO USE A COMMERCIAL HAIR COLORING PRODUCT?</li>
    <li> I colored my hair for years with an ammonia-free hair product I bought at Whole Foods Market, with good results. However, my hair was becoming dry and frizzy from too many years of doing so. I read up on henna, the only real alternative I found, and the claims were good. But everyone says their products are great... so I was skeptical. The first time I tried it, my color looked brassy and awful. Evidently, henna reacts with the coloring left in the hair, and you have to wait three months before switching over. I didn&#x27;t. My mistake. I waited another two months and tried a different color henna, the light brown instead of the light auburn, because my hair is naturally a bit red already. The results were amazing! The light brown on me brings me back to the pretty mixed reddish-brown colors I had before I started covering the gray. And what I love most is that the individual strands take on subtle differences in hue. My hair is so much softer, shinier, and not frizzy anymore!!! I truly am amazed at how well my hair has taken to this product, once I had waited long enough to switch over from chemically coloring it. I&#x27;m going to stick with henna, at least until I decide I&#x27;m ready to go all gray. It is messier and smells terrible to me, but my hair is rejuvenated because of it. The smell lingers in my hair for several days, even after washing. Next time I&#x27;m going to add some essential oils to help curb the odor.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001ET7LNA Light Mountain Natural Color The Gray! Hair Color &amp; Conditioner, Light Brown, 7 oz (Pack of 2)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got done using it, a bit messy, but that is the only drawback. Covered my gray with golden highlights. I am so glad i tried it :)&lt;br /&gt;Just what i wanted.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this yet, but just wanted first timers to beware!  You will need distilled water, ceramic cup and paint brush to use with this or a squirt bottle.  Unlike other hair coloring systems, you will have to do your own boiling and mixing.  This takes a good 1 to 3 hours to prepare.  Also, henna stains your skin, so you will have to use some lotion or vaseline to protect your face, forehead, etc.  So, I agree with the work being well worth the NO Chemicals, but I didn&#x27;t realize I would need to do so much work.  I will update my rating, after I actually get the time to try this product!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be deterred by the person who hasn&#x27;t tried this yet.  I&#x27;ve used Light Mountain henna for almost 20 years - the last five with the color the gray formulas.  You do NOT need distilled water, a ceramic cup or a paint brush or a squirt bottle.  Prep takes 5 minutes, not 1-3 hours.  One thing, it does stain your skin, so if you don&#x27;t use a lotion around your hairline, you might see some staining for a day or two.      This stuff really does color the gray.  The nice thing about henna is it doesn&#x27;t give you \\&quot;helmet head\\&quot; with monochromatic color.  The gray will take on the color of the henna more than your brown/black, etc. hair.  It looks much more natural than highlighting, and it&#x27;s actually good for your hair, as opposed to hair dye. It gives hair incredible body.    Now, I have to admit my husband rolls his eyes when I henna my hair every 7-8 weeks.  It is a mess - like putting mud on your hair.  Put the henna in a glass or ceramic bowl, add hot water.    I add a teaspoon or so of ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg for a little extra color, plus it has a nice aroma that way. Makes your hair smell like a pie instead of the hay smell of the henna.  Stir it up with a plastic spoon that you can throw out.  I just put on the gloves (plastic surgical gloves are much easier than the ones in the packet), use a comb, and apply the henna with my hands.  I rinse my hair out in the utility or kitchen sink where I have a spray nozzle on the faucet..  You have to do it twice - the first one stays on your head for 5 minutes or so before you rinse it out, and the second package for 30-45 minutes.  I    The henna smells like hay for a day or so, so don&#x27;t use it right before you go out on a date!    Still, I think that&#x27;s a small price to pay, and so is the price of the product.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife. There where toooo many reviews to go thru. I picket two types of the same brand on gut feeling and the neat looking box. I bought some also intended to treat grey hair. Encroaching grey hairs was the concerned (she used henna before).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first she was concerned about or mineral rich well water. Sometimes it&#x27;s even very rust laden. Absolutely no problems with the water. The grey strands tuned to highlighted hair slightly lighter than the brown. We will use the grey formula once in a while and touch up with the regular formula when needed. No special prep was taken. The hair looks rich and has good sheen. Smells good (she added some ginger and lemon juice). It also took out some of the dryness and is holding up more than several weeks and still no signs of having to re do the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She used both the the grey an the regular colors.</li>
    <li> Henna is wonderful but this product is horrid. Its terribly hard to rinse out leaves a heavy sandy residue colors are not as deep and rich. Henna is stale. Try the henna for hair website. Best henna products for hair ultra sifted with amazing results and well worth it.</li>
    <li> I have gray hair and worried this would not work over the gray hairs. It did work, and looks much more natural than dye.</li>
    <li> The light brown was too light for me, but I ordered the medium brown and it is perfect!</li>
    <li> Easy to prepare, no chemicals and complements every time.  I have been using this product for two years now and still get comments on my great hair color. I was getting worried always coloring my hair at a salon with chemicals sitting on my head for such a long time. Initally, it takes some getting used to preparing the Light Mountain but after the first time, you know what to do. Varying water amounts helps to make it not too runny. I  recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 53 and my light brown soft, fine hair had turned into course, curly gray. Light Mountain&#x27;s Color the Gray not only changed my hair back to its previous color, it also returned my hair to its previous texture and weight. I LOVE THIS. I have chemical sensitivities and never thought I&#x27;d find a non-toxic product to cover my gray.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical and worried about trying this product since I was new to henna.  I have always used traditional methods to keep the gray hair in check, including eco-colors.  After becoming increasingly itchy after my last hair dye, I decided to give this botanical based non chemical product a try.  I have used twice 7-8 weeks apart and both times the results were consistent.  The first step I mixed up with a little yogurt and egg along with heated bottled water.  No metal objects can be involved.  The first step both times left my hair orange.  The second step I mixed yogurt, egg and hot brewed coffee to the dye and results came out perfect.  Used a blow dryer for maybe 15 minutes and then just left it sit.  No grays left and a wonderful brown color.  The second time I did it it seemed to stink less than the first...not sure if it was the peach yogurt or what but the results were the same.  The only drawback (and I say this just so you know) is that henna is a dye not a chemical change.  It coats the outside of your hair with the color so after so many washes...it starts to fade...thus leaving lots more gray hair showing since all the out-growth is visible.  Easy solution of keeping more product on hand and just doing it when the gray starts to show.  Will continue to look to this product as I am extremely pleased with the results even if the process is a little (okay a lot) different than what I was used to.  My body thanks me.</li>
    <li> It does take some preparation before you can use this product, but it&#x27;s well worth it.  I wish I had known about this product years ago.  I used to spend over $100 to get my hair colored with all sorts of chemicals that have the potential to make you sick.  This costs very little and works just as well as the stuff they put on your head at the salon but it won&#x27;t kill you.  Win win!</li>
    <li> I have been using Light Mountain Natural Hair Color for years and have given that a 5-star review, but this is the first time I have tried Color the Gray.  I have started to get more gray and the product I have been using is not lasting as long as it did, though I was not entirely dissatisfied with it.  This is certainly different.  I found the two-step process to be tiresome as the original Light Mountain takes long enough with one step.  The first step of this process does not seem as gritty and washed out more easily, which is a positive.  Another positive is that the product does seem to cover better, and may be more long-lasting.  However, since the first step is obviously from a different henna plant than I am used to, I found that I did experience some burning of my scalp with that step and lost more hair in the sink when rinsing than usual.  The second step did not burn and hair loss was minimal.  Another complaint with this one is that it made my hair a lot redder than usual.  I use the light brown on my light brown hair, and it usually just gives me some pleasing red highlights.  With this one, I would call my hair color reddish brown.  Not what I was aiming for.  I did purchase another box, but next time I have to think about it before using the first step and may just stick with what I am used to.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  It has been just under two weeks since I used the product, and at this point the one-step Light Mountain Natural Henna would have started to lose color at the front where my gray is.  This is still perfectly colored.  Also, after a couple of days, the color darkened so that it does not appear as red as it did at first.  Now I have a dilemma -- do I try it again considering that my scalp burned and perhaps leave it on for a shorter period of time or not?  Most likely I will give it another try.  Upgrading to 4 stars.  I did not give 5 stars as the 2-step process is more time-consuming.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used this product yet but I was little bit disappointed because it&#x27;s a henna. It doesn&#x27;t  say that when you&#x27;re buying it</li>
    <li> Messy, a real pain to apply, might stop up your drain with all the large particles, orange color. I used one pack and threw the other away.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Henna for a while, and it&#x27;s the only kind that covers my white hair 100%. My hair is super healthy and shiny.</li>
    <li> This is the third time I bought this product. I had been using an over the counter hair color and am a former hairdresser. After 20 years of coloring my hair, it was beginning to thin and break. Now that I have a considerable amount of grey, it is also naturally wavy as well. I decided to switch to henna so I wouldn&#x27;t be putting harsh chemicals on my aging hair, but could still maintain what was left of my youthful appearance.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions on the box and did the 2 step process the first 4 times, but I mixed both batches at the same time and left them sit for 3+ hours in their glass measuring cups. I used chamomile tea in the green bowl to add more gold. But I didn&#x27;t like the thick mud pack, brush on thing so I made both batches about as thick as squeeze bottle mustard and cut the tip of a hair color applicator bottle and squeezed it out like I did with my chemical color. It was still thick enough to not drip and smooshed easily onto the strands of hair. For me, I only left each step on my hair for about 20 - 30 minutes and got a rich reddish-gold light brown.&lt;br /&gt;Today, I was too lazy to do both steps. I decided to mix both packets together in a zip bag, adding enough boiling, distilled water to get the right consistency, added 2 tbs. lemon juice and 1 tbs.argon oil at the end, waited 3+ hours for the mixture to &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34;, washed my hair, put on the mix and waited 35 minutes with plastic cap on. Worked just as well as the 2 step method for me. If I wanted to make it a little darker or less red, I&#x27;d use some coffee in the water.&lt;br /&gt;Rinsing takes a while as I have long hair, and after I rinse it out, I condition twice which gets all the residue out. My color looks a little light, but it seems to darken over the next few days all on its own, so I expect it to do the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;I have been told that my hair is so beautiful, that I should be the poster girl for henna. Nice huh? My hair is coming back and its not breaking off in handfuls when I brush it anymore. Its shiny and soft. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.when I brush it anymore. Its shiny and soft. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> It dies my hair too dark.</li>
    <li> I did exhaustive research on the best way to color greys using natural products and henna (this was my first time using) and decided this brand would be my safest and most effective bet, as I wanted more brown than red tones. Plus, at 47 I have 30-60% VERY stubborn greys even chemical dyes had a hard time covering. Initially, I thought I couldn&#x27;t afford the time this takes, but really, I can&#x27;t afford the time ill health takes either, and am trying to live more chemical free. So...it was messy but kind of therapeutic coating my hair with the &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; and after I initially mixed the first part (I only used warm water in both mixes) and let it cure for 2 hours I began the process. I got step one on, left it for about 30 minutes, rinsed it under the tub facet first, then shower head to make it go quicker. Then I applied the indigo mix which had cured for about 30 minutes. It took about 30 minutes to get it all applied really well, so from the time I began (roots and brighter red areas first) it was on for about an hour. Again I rinsed the same way adding conditioner in the shower to help get all the grit out. Rinsing wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought it would be, I think going under the high pressure tub facet first really helped. Tips: Do the strand test! I naturally have medium to light mousy brown hair, 6 weeks post Naturtint 5N box color that was faded badly.  Initially I bought the medium brown kit and it came out too dark for my taste, the color of dark chocolate. This color is pretty dark too but all the highlights make it appear lighter and salon quality. I also spread old towels on the sink and floor and cut openings on a trash bag to wear myself as another reviewer suggested - great tip as it does drip and get everywhere. Invest in salon gloves, I bought one pair of salon gloves, next time I will have a pair for each step as it was too hard to get the henna off the first pair to use in the second step. I found using gloved hands was the best way to get it on. After I was showered and cleaned up it was only a 3 hour process from the time I starting applying step one. And the color is fabulous!! It completely covered my grey, turned them to either golden or reddish brown highlights and the rest of my hair is a beautiful warm, rich brown color with glimmers of auburn in light. I am so impressed with this and so over joyed that I don&#x27;t have to give into grey now. I will definately be using this product from now on, Light Mountain don&#x27;t ever go out of business!!</li>
    <li> Very good stuff for people that have almost all white hair. 2 steps easy to follow just make sure you have some free time. It is not a fast process.</li>
    <li> Ive tried regular LM henna and it did not cover my grey, this covers them. I will continue to buy this product, i love that I can color my hair without the harsh chemicals. My hair is in such great shape, and is the same exact color as I used to get with regular color. While its a 2 step process and is time consuming, its not hard to do just takes time and is a bit messy. Word of warning line the bathroom with towels or paper.</li>
    <li> I use this because its super clean.  even the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair dyes have alot of questionable ingredients. it is VERY goopy and a big pain to apply. it works fairly well, covering my grey streaks to a slightly lighter tint than my brown hair. its the best i have found that doesnt have chemicals, so i&#x27;ll take it</li>
    <li> I am NOT an allergy prone person. I had no known allergies before using this.&lt;br /&gt;I had and continue to have a significant, scary allergic reaction to this product.&lt;br /&gt;I applied it Sunday morning for an event Sunday afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;When I woke up Monday morning my ears were bright red, inflamed, swollen and very itchy, as was my neck all around in front, back and sides, and the whole upper chest. It felt like sunburn. It was so intense I had to apply cold water all day to get moments of relief.&lt;br /&gt;The inflammation and itchiness has persisted 4 days now. Today the itchiness is less severe, but still a problem, especially the neck.&lt;br /&gt;The process was a huge MESS. Bag #1 application was difficult - big goopy glops were falling on the floor and on my feet. I does not stick to hair. You have to position your head to use gravity. I mixed bag #2 to be wetter, which was worse, because the product dripped all over &amp; I had to stand in the shower stall while waiting, to prevent a bigger mess.&lt;br /&gt;Bag #1 turned my scalp and gray hairs carrot orange. Bag #2 toned it down some with a beige color. The final result had an orange cast, which was better than the grays, but far, far worse than my trusty Clairol Loving Care Natural Instincts. I liked Loving Care because it had no peroxide, no ammonia and is non-permanent.&lt;br /&gt;Clairol does not make that product anymore. A rep told me there is a similar product in their professional line.  I haven&#x27;t researched it yet. I never had an allergic reaction to Loving Care and as far as I know I didn&#x27;t get cancer.&lt;br /&gt;This henna product gave me a a very frightening allergic reaction and obviously is impossible to use. I did find a henna forum where other women reported the same allergic reaction to this specific product.</li>
    <li> This product was diffcult and messy to apply. The small was horrible and stayed for a few days. I got no results. No results, whatsoever!</li>
    <li> Tried to call seller and did not get an answer so I e-mailed for a return address and did not receive an answer. My 20 year old granddaughter call to tell me not to use the product because she just used it and it had ruined her hair.</li>
    <li> Did I say I love it?  I have used this for many years.  The Light Brown color.  I do want red highlights, unlike many people and have found a way to do it.  But first, it was in my blonde phase that I started using it.  It covered everything:  ugly roots and all.  It was gorgeous but not quite the color I wanted so I started experimenting.  Using the older instructions, I actually used no water and hot fresh lemon juice for both treatments. I add an egg to the second treatment.  5-7 minutes for the first and 1 hour for the second treatment.  I use a plastic container and wooden spoon and slop it on and spread it through my roots and part.  I even do my eyebrows with it.  The new instructions are more PC and tell you to be careful with heat but if you carefully heat the water and/or use a hairdryer for a few minutes during the second treatment it helps it set.  Recently I tried a hair color because I was lazy, not good so I waited a few weeks and decided to use my henna again.  I left it on a little longer hoping it would cover the hair color better. To my surprise, it actually lightened my hair and covered up the yucky hair color.  Obviously the lemon juice does let you take the color down, a few of the gray hairs were platinum but have since changed to a little more strawberry.  It is messy to use which is daunting.  If my husband knew how to post on Facebook I would be in serious trouble.  Recently I saw a cousin I hadn&#x27;t seen forever, a hairdresser, and she had to touch my hair, she was amazed.  Don&#x27;t be afraid just be careful, don&#x27;t touch metal with it, although I will admit a couple of times I had some green highlights afterwards from touching something.  I went out in the sun, gave it a bit and the green was gone replaced by what it should have been.  I should be the spokesperson and give lessons because I am so pleased with this product.  Hope you enjoy using it, or at least the results of your efforts.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd time using this product. I have African-American hair and found it to be very drying but I knew this product is good for my hair so I included some natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, I mixed both powders with a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil and an egg. It rinsed out easier and my hair felt immediately softer. For the last rinse, I saturated my hair with my expense conditioner, put on a conditioning plastic cap, then a shower cap, then wrapped my head in a scarf and went to bed. The next morning, I rinsed out the conditioner and my hair was very silky and shiny and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week, I washed with shampoo and the color was even nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So glad I stuck with this product. I feel safer knowing I&#x27;m not using harsh chemicals in my hair.</li>
    <li> Cover all my grey hair.</li>
    <li> This product was horrible.  It felt like I had muddy grit stuck in my hair like glue.  It was very difficult to get out.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I had ruined my hair.  Had to shampoo over and over.&lt;br /&gt;I threw away the other box I had.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this! I totally messed up my hair color with box dye, dyed it 4 times in one day out of frustration and still didnt get color i wanted, had to go to salon - the same day- where the only color she could feasibly color it to my satisfaction, was copper/orange, which i hated (but was better than what it was when i walked into the salon.) i knew i couldnt dye it again if i didnt want to wake up with my hair left on my pillow so i researched and discovered henna. having no other choice, i bought the light brown, just received it today and couldnt wait to use it. i frickin love it! it&#x27;s brown again, not a single strand is copper/orange, and even has a few blondish highlights, somehow. it looks fantastic and used no chemicals. the only downside- only bc im so damned impatient, is the wait time: i waited an hour for it to cure (the period after mixing boiling distilled water and henna) and waited abt 40 minutes after putting it on my hair to rinse out. maybe i didnt need to wait so long to cure, dont no since it was my 1st time and i damn sure didnt want to mess this up! otherwise im absolutely THRILLED with the results!!</li>
    <li> Best thing I have ever done - hair feels great - get lots of compliments and no more allergic reaction.  I love this product!!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover gray well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years now and I love it. I especially love the way the color begins to fade slowly and doesn&#x27;t give you the skunk look like other color products. The applying technique can be a trial if you are doing it by yourself but I&#x27;ve got a great friend always willing to help me out which also passes the time quickly with good conversation. : )</li>
