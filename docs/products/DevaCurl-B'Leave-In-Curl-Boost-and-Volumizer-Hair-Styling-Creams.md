      <li>However, besides the Set it Free spray, I had yet to find a Deva styling product that I truly liked and that could keep the fizz at bay all day.</li>
      <li>I primarily bought it because it had a very low toxicity score in the EWG Cosmetic Database, but I&#x27;ve been very impressed with how well it works.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the feeling that gel or hairspray leaves in my hair, but I get frizz easily without, B&#x27;Leave-</li>

      <li>Such a great leave-in conditioner.</li>
      <li>Light weight on your hair.  </li>
      <li>It works well as a light gel-like volumizer but the smell is overpowering in a noxious way.  </li>
      <li>I think the product is either cheaply made or just builds up over time on the hair.</li>

      <li>The price was right in the product I love and have been recommending to my Curly Head friends</li>

      <li>it settled) as if I used a super cheap product.</li>
      <li>I started really loving this product in the summer; I use it after swimming in my wet hair, and it leaves my hair (after air drying) soft, shiny and touchable, with beautiful beachy waves.</li>
      <li>On the whole, I like this product and would recommend it to others, but I will keep searching to see if I can find an even better alternative.</li>
      <li>I also don&#x27;t really like the smell, but it&#x27;s not awful.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s true what others have said, it flakes in your hair once it dries.</li>
      <li>It nicely saturates the ends and makes your hair sooooo soft.</li>
      <li>maybe if you have very curly hair you need to use more.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This has met all my expectations.  My curls love it.</li>
    <li> I am a DevaCurl girl for life. I love their No-Poo, Low-Poo and One Condition and use daily. I used the B&#x27;Leave In for a few months and it made my curls look beautiful! Shiny, defined, frizz free, and soft to the touch. The only downside is the white fluffy flakes that fell out of my hair after using for a few weeks. I think the product is either cheaply made or just builds up over time on the hair. If it didn&#x27;t flake, I would still use it. I switched to using Mixed Chicks leave-in conditioner paired with Deva Curl Light Defining Gel. My hair needs  a leave-in conditioner as I have 3B curls that need lots of moisture and hold, which is why I use the Mixed Chicks. Deva Curl doesn&#x27;t really offer any other kind of leave-in conditioner which I believe most curly girls need. You could simply not rinse out all of the One Condition while in the shower and then use the Light Defining Gel, but I&#x27;m usually in the shower too long and end up rinsing all of the conditioner out. It also depends on the type of curls you have. My curls are very dry and need a LOT of moisture. A leave-in is a must.</li>
    <li> I love all of the Deva products.  This one helps to keep the frizz down.  I use it regularly and will re-order it when I get low.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. The only thing that makes my curly hair behave and look well groomed instead of looking like a dry tumbleweed.</li>
    <li> Have wavy or curly hair?  Buy this...  I have tried EVERY Aveda product &amp; this is SO much better!  I even tried curl confidence, that was 3x as much &amp; NO GOOD! B&#x27;Leave in is not sticky, not crunchy, it beats the frizz &amp; really makes my hair curlier. I need to be able to run my fingers through my hair &amp; this product even allows me to comb it (wide tooth) with no frizz.  I use it wet after a rinse or wash &amp; then after it&#x27;s dried for more curl activation.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> this item is great for curly hair, it leaves hair soft and smelling great, not all stiff like some products, I highly recommend for people with curly hair! finally a product for us!</li>
    <li> I like this conditioner especially on the first day I use it but it does not seem to do much if you do not reapply it on the second day. I do not need more volume in my hair and maybe that is why I prefer Heaven in the Hair and the conditioner to this.</li>
    <li> leaves flaky residues on the hair when it dries up.</li>
    <li> it is an ok I still have a little frizz</li>
    <li> be careful with the amount you put on.  i am a deva curl devotee for over 12 years and have boticelli curls.  if i put too much of this on my hair can feel weighed down.  nearly each day i use deva care one condition, then b&#x27;leave-in, and finally angel.  i use no-poo 2 times/week for deeper cleansing.  :-)</li>
    <li> This stuff works for my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product and it arrived on time! Great!</li>
    <li> I have very fine 2a hair that can go either way. I was using ArcAngel before discovering this little beaut. This stuff is amazing! Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down &amp; adds defining curls &amp; volume. Does not leave a sticky film or harden hair. The texture is very silky. I can even use this on my second day without washing, just slightly wet hair and add B&#x27;Leave-In &amp; curls are even more gorgeous than on a wash day. I use the no poo and one condition on wash days and use ONLY this when scrunching hair. This one is a keeper, only product I need to define my curls!</li>
    <li> I put this on my loosely curly hair when it is half dry by rubbing it on my hands and scrunching my hair. Then I let it air dry.  It holds the shape of the loose ringlets well without looking plastic.  It reduces frizz.  When I feel my hair after it dries, it feels natural and nearly soft.  Best leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Best hair gel I found for my wavy/curly hair. I use very little to keep my curls defined. I don&#x27;t have a lot of curls, so maybe if you have very curly hair you need to use more. For me a little of it goes a really long way. I primarily bought it because it had a very low toxicity score in the EWG Cosmetic Database, but I&#x27;ve been very impressed with how well it works. I&#x27;ve been using it for six months now, and it worked well during winter months as well as hot summer/spring months. When I ran out of it, I saw a huge difference in how my hair behaved without it (much more freeze, less definition to my curls). I don&#x27;t have much of white residue left on my hair after I use it, but maybe it&#x27;s because I use only a little of it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use in conjunction with the DevaCurl sulfate-free shampoo. After cleansing, I squeezed out some of the water and applied this product to very wet hair, scrunching it as I usually do. It looked okay at first, but later when my hair was completely dry I noticed some crusty stuff in my hair and realized that the dried product was flaking off of my hair. I&#x27;m not sure why this happened, and no one else mentioned this happening to them. I&#x27;ve tried it twice with the same results, but I&#x27;ll give it one more shot before sending it to the Land of Failed Curly Hair Products. I also don&#x27;t really like the smell, but it&#x27;s not awful.</li>
    <li> This was just one of 4 items i purchased from the DevaCurl line. This product and the conditioner that I had purchased both have a horrible smell. It&#x27;s so weird because the Lowpoo and the AnGel both smell fresh and fruity. The conditioner and curl boost both leave your hair smelling like you dunked your head in a bucket of Pine Sol. That&#x27;s not an appealing smell and it stays with you until you wash your hair again. I can&#x27;t even use the products. The smell is too much! I&#x27;m going to be ordering Ouidad next time. At least I know that I won&#x27;t smell like a floor mop!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and it really seems to do justice to my long &amp; wavy hair.  I Devacurl products are of very good quality, but wish they were a little more affordable.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  I have curly hair, but thin and this does add some volume and spruces up the curls.  I also think it smells great.  Love all the Deva products I have purchases thus far (no poo and conditioner are also awesome, and again, smell great).  Products do not weigh down hair either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different gels but always stuck to mousse because it&#x27;s what worked best for me. I figured I would give this a try and man do I LOVE IT!! My curls are soft, well defined, and bouncy just the way I like them! I use my Deva Diffuser (can&#x27;t go without it) to dry my hair and it&#x27;s just perfection. Will definitely be using this from now on even if it&#x27;s more expensive than the mousse.</li>
    <li> I tried DevaCurl products through my co-workers and had to try some more on my own. I&#x27;ve only used it this week but I can tell I ordered the right product. This B&#x27;Leave-In curl boost and volumizer is just what my hair needs. I have very fine hair and using this really adds the volume and conditions my hair. Can&#x27;t wait to work on it again for the weekend!  Great item!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a long time. Really does what says and I will keep buying it. Good product.</li>
    <li> This product is far less sticky than gels I&#x27;ve used in the past and does a better job in defining and holding my curls.</li>
    <li> Works great with my hair</li>
    <li> This really works for my curly hair. Sets the curl without leaving it crunchy.</li>
    <li> This is great leave in curl boost and volumizer.  We love this stuff.  I will be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> Totally great to really define those curls!</li>
    <li> My curls fight a top layer of fizz. The usual solution is strong styling cream or gel, in fact my stylist advised me to use the strongest gel Deva makes (I don&#x27;t fit the hair &amp;#34;profile&amp;#34; described on the B&#x27;Leave-In package). However, besides the Set it Free spray, I had yet to find a Deva styling product that I truly liked and that could keep the fizz at bay all day. In spite of only using No Poo and always conditioning with my One Condition and even my beloved Set it Free, my hair was looking dry and extra fizzy (summer woes, I guess). I bought B&#x27;leave-In on a whim for a conditioning leave-in treatment....however, to my surprise this is the best styling product I have ever used! I wish they sold it by the gallon ;) While my hair is soaking wet, I mist with Set it Free then use B&#x27;Leave-In like you are supposed to use the gels--generous amount, squish through curls. The result is what I always wanted the gels to be and unlike the gels...no fizz...no matter how long my day goes. It looks great while it&#x27;s drying (you don&#x27;t have to be paranoid about touching your hair before it dries...it is touchable throughout), dries fast (the gels took forever for me) and looks even better dry...it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my curls (I don&#x27;t have to use any clips while it dries)...perfect for my &amp;#34;wash and go&amp;#34; life style. Styling products are a subjective experience, what works for one might fail for another...but if you need some extra hydration this is worth a shot.</li>
    <li> I love this gel! It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair all crunchy but it still does what it needs to! I even bought some for my sister and she loves it too!</li>
    <li> LOVE. Will try more of DevaCurl&#x27;s products in the future.</li>
    <li> This product smells great and goes on smoothly. It provides a good curl boost, but not a strong hold. I would recommend it for those looking for a light-weight hold.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product as it is light but effective</li>
    <li> Great product, just not for me. I found it a little tacky when applying to my hair, but it gets the job done if you don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for curly hair that I&#x27;ve tried so far. It leaves my curls soft and bouncy, and it feels super light! I&#x27;ve tried tons of other products, to include others Deva gels and cream, but this is by far the best for my hair type. Love it!</li>
    <li> deva products are the best, you can just re wet your hair the next day and it will reactivate this gel</li>
    <li> I love this product as well as all of their other products. It&#x27;s very wet so you can use it on dry hair. It doesn&#x27;t build up and rinses out easily the next day. Try it, you won&#x27;t be dissapointed!!</li>
    <li> LOVE the Deva line of products!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product for holding curl &amp; conditioning my hair at the same time.  I have wavy hair that is curlier if I let it dry &amp; use this product.  It keeps my hair from looking frizzy and has a soft hold.  I mix a little of it with the light hold gel that Deva makes.</li>
    <li> This works very well.  I have tight curls and this gives me fuller curls.  Don&#x27;t use a lot, i feel when i do it tends to dry out my hair.  Just a little, it is such a silky liquid, you really do not need alot.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works, oh my gosh this is the best thing that could of happened to my hair. I use it everyday, just a little and it curls just fine. The only bad thing is I think Deva Curl is a little pricey but what the heck a girl gotta do what a girl gotta do.</li>
    <li> This product is supposed to boost and volumize curls that are more on the thin side.  Unfortunately for me the &amp;#34;volume&amp;#34; came in the form of frizz.  I tried this product many times using differing amounts with the same results.  This is not a product I can recommend.</li>
    <li> I have tried just about all their products. This one works great on my thick hair. It smells good and isn&#x27;t sticky or gummy. Use it after you cleanse, condition.</li>
    <li> great for curls, but my skin on neck and ears break out after a few days of using the product. I had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this line for several years but not this product until ordering from amazon. It works well as a light gel-like volumizer but the smell is overpowering in a noxious way.  I won&#x27;t reorder.</li>
    <li> This is the first DevaCurl product I do not like.  I usually use a cream but decided to try this gel. It leaves my hair limp and a touch frizzy.</li>
    <li> I tried it by itself, but it did nothing for my hair.  I have very fine hair with a lot of curl to wave. It just made my hair flop, which was odd for a product that is supposed to create some volume.  Then I mixed it with the Angel gel, which was better.  Then I found that less of this, with the usual amount of gel was optimum.  Unfortunately, the directions don&#x27;t tell you how to use it other than the usual scrunch it in. They should probably have the directions for a few different scenarios. I envy those who can just put in their hair and have it work.  I have not tried it on dry hair, or on a second day. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Really a good product for the price. Best on naturally curly hair. Its a light weight product that keeps the frizz down and the curl up!</li>
    <li> I love all the DevaCurl products. This one meet my expectations for my daughters hair and I would recommend to those with beautiful curls.</li>
    <li> quem tem cabelo afro e quer definir os cachinhos &amp;eacute; perfeito, eu nao consigo tirar a mão do cabelo, meus cachos nunca foram tã definidos.Vendedor confiavel, chegou em 5 dias.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! My hair is curly in the summer and wavy in the winter. In the colder months my hair definitely needs a lift due to the lack of humidity, and this provides the volume I need.  Also, it smells really wonderful!</li>
    <li> Good Stuff...I&#x27;ve used it for years and it&#x27;s nice not to have to buy it at the salon, it&#x27;s delivered to my door.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell and that you can curl your hair the way you want it to. It is easy and simple, your hair won&#x27;t feel hard or dry afterwards. It is doing its job.</li>
    <li> I love all the Deva products and this is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a super addition and it smells terrific too!</li>
    <li> This product works great on my curly hair, helps tame the frizz. I like to use it when my hair is still wet and it really helps the curls to set without getting frizzy. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a great addition to the arc angel. Usually hair products seem useless but this is surprisingly wonderful.</li>
    <li> too frizzy, too uptight curly,  too bad.  It turned out like a cheap perm, a home perm that was too scrunched instead of shiny, loose curls.</li>
    <li> smells amazing, kind of light, it didn&#x27;t give my hair (s-wavy) enough curl and made my hair a little too soft</li>
    <li> I love all the products in this line.  Having naturally curly hair at my old age is fun as these products help alot in preserving them and making them look great.</li>
    <li> Deva is a great product for curly hair.</li>
    <li> It works.  It turns my waves into a curlier mane. I would recommend this product to anyone who loves their curls!</li>
    <li> The DevaCurl product line is fabulous.  The B&#x27;Leave-In works great for me.  I don&#x27;t like the feeling that gel or hairspray leaves in my hair, but I get frizz easily without, B&#x27;Leave-In keeps the frizz away and leaves my hair soft and feeling product free at the same time!</li>
    <li> I have searched for a line of products for my curly hair my entire life.  This is THE stuff...even in a humid or dry climate.</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever.  Light weight on your hair.  I even use it to freshen up and tone down frizz on dry hair.</li>
    <li> Such a great leave-in conditioner. I ran out after about a month, and broke down and bought the large bottle. Use it like you would the gel: turn your head upside down and scrunch your hair toward your face. It nicely saturates the ends and makes your hair sooooo soft.</li>
    <li> Love this for volumizing.  Use with the no-poo and conditioner for beautiful waves or curls.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, dry, fragile, corkicelli-ish curls and I&#x27;ve been exclusively using Deva products in the hopes that my hair will become healthier.  But until this stuff, I have sooo missed my silicone gels!  B-Leave-In feels really weird in my hair when it&#x27;s wet (can&#x27;t explain the weird feeling - thick and almost dry feeling...? ), but it works!  It gives me thick, springy, shiny and soft curls with absolutely no feeling of residue.  As other reviewers have said, it doesn&#x27;t really hold, so I also use some ultra-defining gel first, (after a dab of Heaven-In-Hair).  Like other reviewers, I also experience some itchy scalp from the botanicals in Deva products.  In combo with my Q-redew, I feel much more in-control of my curly locks and will be buying the big size next time.</li>
    <li> I use this on 2nd or third day wash and go to refresh and my curls look gorgeous ans the first day wash</li>
    <li> The product is good. I&#x27;ve used it before. However the packaging was so tight that it broke the top of the pump. I had to buy another container and transfer the product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t pump up my curls like I thought it might, but it&#x27;s not a bad product.</li>
    <li> Best DevaCurl product if your hair tends towards fine, wispy, and frizzy. This product does not weigh down my hair like some of the other Devacurl products. Used with No Poo and conditioner, love this line.</li>
    <li> This products makes my curls pop.  I mostly use the curl boost when I put my hair in a high bun which then makes my curls turn into tighter waves.  I only need to use a little. It glides through the hair and isn&#x27;t sticky and it doesnt leave your hair hard. I have 4A-4B with an unusual amount of 2 and 3C.  I wouldn&#x27;t style my hair without this product.</li>
    <li> This product was advertised and prevention magazine I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. The price was right in the product I love and have been recommending to my Curly Head friends</li>
    <li> Like this product, works well.  All these products are great and work really well with my hair.  I love the conditioner  Just trying to get enough words.</li>
    <li> I still haven&#x27;t figured out how to use this product in a way that is best for my hair. If I use it after I condition with OneCondition, my hair is flat. If I use solely as a leave-in conditioner, it sometimes looks nice, but if I use too much it weighs it down. I have very fine hair so I don&#x27;t know if this is the right product for me, but I&#x27;m sure on some people it works very well. I guess you don&#x27;t know until you try.</li>
    <li> This is a good leave in that defines curls and waves. It&#x27;s a bit lacking in the moisture department, but it provides decent frizz control and won&#x27;t weigh your hair down.  It contains a large amount of glycerin, a powerful humectant, so it&#x27;s better for use during the warmer seasons.  On the whole, I like this product and would recommend it to others, but I will keep searching to see if I can find an even better alternative.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! I have wavy to curly hair. The gel helps maintain curls without frizz.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s true what others have said, it flakes in your hair once it dries. it&#x27;s non-crunchy, but it does not moisturize your hair either. Waste of money</li>
    <li> I especially don&#x27;t like the way my hair feels the next day and so the basically full tube just sits there.</li>
    <li> Bought it with confidence thinking that it would work... When I used it, my hair started flaking(after it settled) as if I used a super cheap product. I just emailed them... Its not a product I would reccomend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Love this product this whole line is a must if you have curls</li>
    <li> This is probably the best product of the entire Deva line. I use it for my very fine, over shoulder length hair that has loose curls. I started really loving this product in the summer; I use it after swimming in my wet hair, and it leaves my hair (after air drying) soft, shiny and touchable, with beautiful beachy waves. Just don&#x27;t use too much, or else it will get sticky.</li>
    <li> I have fine curls and a medium amount of hair.  (not thick/not thin)  This product didn&#x27;t really have enough weight for me - my fine texture requires some oomph so it doesn&#x27;t just turn into fluff.  Maybe it would be better for someone with coarser or thicker hair, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the DevaCurl products for about a year. Then I added this and I LOVE the results. I have fine wavy/curly hair. My hair isn&#x27;t as dry/frizzy. It feels great and I love the smell.</li>
    <li> I use mostly all DevaCurl products and this is another great product of theirs.  I have very curly thick hair and this helps define my curls.  If I use too much it will get crunchy but a little while my hair is wet and it will define and you don&#x27;t know I have any product in.</li>
