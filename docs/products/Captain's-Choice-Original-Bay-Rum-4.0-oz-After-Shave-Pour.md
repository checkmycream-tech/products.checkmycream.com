<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this 3x so far, so i&#x27;ll just give my initial impressions which I can come in and add my long-term review later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t burn quite like everyone else says it will. You know it&#x27;s on your face, it&#x27;s alcohol based afterall, but so far for me it&#x27;s never truly burned. Don&#x27;t smell the bottle or you&#x27;ll regret it. When it&#x27;s in the bottle it&#x27;s overwhelmingly strong and doesn&#x27;t really smell pleasant. Quite pungent and bad actually. Once you put a few drops on your palms and apply to your face however the smell turns more to a &amp;#34;holiday&amp;#34; / Orange scent. Didn&#x27;t really know what to expect but that&#x27;s what I got initially. Longevity is good, as I can apply it in the mornings and I&#x27;ll still be able to catch a faint whiff at 5pm or thereabouts. By evening it&#x27;s all but faded though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first aftershave i&#x27;ve ever tried, so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to. I am quite impressed though, and will continue to use this for quite some time!</li>
    <li> Bay Rum is my favorite thing to slap on my face. Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> This bay rum has very strong clove notes and not much bay. If you like your bay rum heavy on the spice, then this one might be the one for you. I strongly prefer Dominica or other less clove-heavy bay rums, though.</li>
    <li> very satisfied with this purchase</li>
    <li> Nothing bad but not what my husband was looking for......so we&#x27;ll try something else.</li>
    <li> A nice smell, not heavy. No complaints from family or coworkers.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Kind of strong in the bottle but it smells great on the skin. That&#x27;s not just me, my wife likes it a lot. Feels very refreshing, too. I can&#x27;t wait to try the Captain&#x27;s Choice Lime!</li>
    <li> A classic smell that stays a while. The wife likes it also.</li>
    <li> Very good.  Not overpowering, and not a heavy sting like other Bay Rums&lt;br /&gt;This one is my go-to when the weather is starting to turn and I don&#x27;t yet need the moisturizing of the balms or other low-alcohol aftershaves, but when it&#x27;s getting just a bit too cool and dry for my normal high-alcohol concoctions.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as a surprise. Neither of us were sure we would like it, especially when we opened the bottle and a very strong clove scent came through, even though another reviewer said there were no cloves. After shaking the bottle, though, the scent leveled out and we were able to smell the bay. When he put it on, he said it burned like fire, but after the burn stopped, he said his skin felt smooth. I know for certain he smelled wonderful! He described the scent as \\&quot;Christmas cookies\\&quot; but I think it has a much more masculine undertone, very exotic and spicy.</li>
    <li> So, I get this delivered all the way from Florida to my place in like two days with FREE SHIPPING from Men&#x27;s Direct. Packaging was alright it came in a box with that tissue paper stuff. It was in a ziploc bag which was covered by bubble wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only issue I had with the packaging was that the bubble wrap was only on the sides of the bottle. When I lifted it up, the bottle almost slipped and fell to the floor. Luckily, I&#x27;m cautious so I stopped myself from fully turning it upwards before it fell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, I HATED the smell. I just recently got into wet shaving so I just wanted the best product. But then I shaved and gave it a second chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT IS AMAZING! The initial sting is a very nice and refreshing wake up call. The smell is terrible in the bottle because it so CONCENTRATED. But once you dab a little bit on your face, the smell really evens up and becomes very subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the all natural ingredients, the high quality glass bottle, and the very traditional feel this aftershave has. I will definitely be buying more of these and I hope the Captain comes up with more fragrances for us to try. I will certainly get the Lime one next summer (hopefully I&#x27;ll finish the Bay Rum by that time, hahah).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was definitely worth my time and money! I&#x27;m a fan of quality and this certainly meets my high standards.</li>
    <li> &#x27;Tis the Captain&#x27;s choice, and that cad get&#x27;s all the lasses! Nice scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering, simple ingredients and is great for wet-shaving with double edge blades.</li>
    <li> This is great smelling after shave.  I saw this listed on a conference I wanted to attend and so I purchased it blindly.  I didn&#x27;t make a mistake.  It is my favorite after shave.  It does burn a little after shaving but it is short and the smell overcompensates for the burn.  This after shave is natural and doesn&#x27;t contain any added smells which makes it even more amazing.  I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
    <li> Great Christmas present.  Nice smell, cool bottle and label.</li>
    <li> Have to say. I prefer the lime more. But this stuff is still high quality aftershave. It does it&#x27;s job. The scent is just a bit unappealing.</li>
    <li> I honestly hated this in the beginning. My wife could not stand the smell which reminds me of the dentist office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally do not get a lot of burn from mine but then again I enjoy the burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My preference has always been old spice for its distinct smell but this really grows on you.&lt;br /&gt;The next one I might try is that cat o&#x27; nine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product really is a try and see but keep using it before you discard it immediately</li>
    <li> Over the last year or so, I have bought and used five different after shave lotions - Lucky Tiger, Proraso, Pinaud Clubman, and Captain&#x27;s Choice (Bay Rum and Sandalwood). Depending on my mood, I used one or the other, so my comparison has been somewhat continuous. Overall, they are all excellent, however, they are naturally different in various ways, so one&#x27;s taste may cause a preference for one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucky Tiger is the least astringent. You don&#x27;t get that cooling sensation. It&#x27;s probably the most like a skin conditioner. Although its label says &amp;#34;with Aloe Vera&amp;#34;, its other ingredients are not listed. Its aloe vera plus I suspect witch hazel are what make me say it is most like a skin conditioner. I don&#x27;t think it has any alcohol. So if you&#x27;re most concerned about keeping your face smooth and soft over the long run, you might prefer Lucky Tiger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The others all have alcohol and give you that familiar cooling, fresh, astringent sensation. I would say that Pinaud Clubman is the most astringent and cooling, followed by Proraso, Clubman&#x27;s Bay Rum, and Clubman&#x27;s Sandalwood. It&#x27;s hard to say there is a difference between the two Clubman&#x27;s varieties. The coolness of Proraso is minty and lingers a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t believe in giving a product a poor review because it doesn&#x27;t meet a personal preference (for example scent or astringency in an after shave). Therefore, I would rate them all as five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My preference is Pinaud Clubman because I like a cool feeling on my face after a shave. Also, when an after shave causes any razor burns and minor cuts to sting, I feel like I am doing something positive to treat them, even if another after shave might help them heal better without your feeling anything. Lack of stinging indicates fewer burns and cuts meaning that I&#x27;ve given myself a good shave. So, the more astringency the better for me. As a bonus, Pinaud Clubman is the lowest cost.</li>
    <li> As others have stated it has a horrible smell. Could not use.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a friend of mine who likes Bay Rum and I like it too.  Usually he gets a different brand.  I don&#x27;t know if the bottle we got had gone bad, but it had a strong medicinal smell like burnt rubber.  It was very unpleasant.  I wanted to return it but he wouldn&#x27;t let me.  He&#x27;s going to go back to purchasing the Domenica brand.</li>
    <li> Smells like iodine. People have been raving about this,  so I decided to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t have that refreshing after-shave scent or kick,  it&#x27;s more like an antiseptic. It has no&lt;br /&gt;miraculous healing properties as so many claim.&lt;br /&gt;After a few aborted attempts,  I finally poured it down the sink. Horrible stuff.</li>
    <li> I really like Captain&#x27;s Choice aftershaves. I have a few others besides this one. Good bite and good scent that lasts long enough to satisfy. Something about it gives me a feeling of nostalgia. Can&#x27;t put my finger on the memory yet but for me that makes the product that much better</li>
    <li> If you are not the manliest of all men, this product is probably not for you. If you want to smell like Brian Fantana as he walks up to his next challenge, then you need bay rum by your side!</li>
    <li> Nice pleasant smell. Mild. No real &#x27;brace&#x27; on application. Lasts two hours....tested indirectly in car ride with my wife...smell dissipated in a couple of hours even in closed vehicle when sitting side by side. Would not buy again because of low sticking-quality even though I like the soft non-obtrusive smell.</li>
    <li> Great Bay Rum fragrance, feels great on the face and is definitely the Captain&#x27;s Choice.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;m not very experienced with aftershaves, but I bought the sample pack, so I thought I&#x27;d throw up a review of the 5 brands available today.  1) Original - The old bay original scent smells strongly of Jamaican cloves and allspice. It has a touch of orange peel behind it as well. It is not a subtle smell, and lacks the complexity of the Cat O Nine. I ranked this fourth, among the 5, and in all honesty, probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. 2) Cat O Nine - Very similar to the original in a lot of ways, it still smells strongly of cloves and allspice, but also has hints of sugarcane, and loose tobacco (in a good way). In theory, Cat o Nine is supposed to be hotter, but I didn&#x27;t notice the heat. It barely stung at all. Still, whether upping the alcohol mellows out the cloves, or whether they have just added more to it, Cat O Nine is, in my opinion one of the top two scents in the bullpen (tie for 1st place.) Five stars. 3) Lime - The name says it all. It smells like lime. Its a subtle lime, though, as if the bartender were cutting and squeezing limes several feet away. I personally don&#x27;t like this scent, and it dissipated within an hour or so, much faster than all the other scents, I&#x27;d put this one at around 2 stars, and there aren&#x27;t many bottles I wouldn&#x27;t pick up before buying this again. 4) Sandalwood - Sandalwood is tricky. To be honest, I am amazed at the fidelity of this aftershave to the real deal. I have a couple of humidors that I keep around, just for decoration, and this smell reminds me of them so thoroughly that I&#x27;d swear that there was a box under my nose. My problem is that I&#x27;m not so sure that I personally like the smell as an aftershave. This is my 3rd favorite. 5) North - Captains choice is a truly amazing brand. They have 5 scents, and each one is so rich, complex, deep and faithful that you can build a mental castle around it. Conjure from nothing an old bar, with heavy wooden tables and fishermen fresh off the boat or a grand study filled with booksand papers... and then you can live there. Every breath you take reinforces this mental image that sits in your mind. For me, North is home. North is cold winter&#x27;s day in front of a roaring campfire at dawn. I&#x27;m drinking instant cocoa while my father cooks pancakes on the campstove. I can&#x27;t describe the scent of North, except to say that if you have ever been camping in a pine forest, you know this scent. Pine and Juniper, Ozone and Morning dew. Life. That&#x27;s what they put inside this bottle. Tied for first. Five stars.</li>
    <li> This product is a very good quality . No perfume just good cleam manly smell that is great for after a shave. the end.</li>
    <li> I look forward to shaving knowing this will be going on when I finish.&lt;br /&gt;The witch hazel and glycerin make my face smooth as glass.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish the good smell would last longer.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Wow - can&#x27;t say enough about this after shave. Smell is great and not too powerful. I&#x27;ve had it on for a couple hours now and still detect a faint smell. My wife seemed to like it, and both my kids told me I smelled good. Works for me!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells awesome. This is what I&#x27;d imagine guys used back in the day before men got caught up in lotions and moisturizing and all that stuff. First, its got a great &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; when you splash it on. Not too much but it will wake you up. Really tightens up the face after a wet DE shave and the smell is fantastic. Very strong clove smell, really masculine. Not overpowering once it dries, but from time to time through the day I&#x27;ll catch a hint of it so it lasts quite a while. I&#x27;d been using the lotion type like GF Trumper (the coral really smells like flowers - wife was not a fan) but I think this is better route. Your skin will feel better and you&#x27;ll walk out the door smelling great!</li>
    <li> Closest to the bay Rum we used to be able to get - very pungent and smells great.</li>
    <li> Saw all the glowing reviews and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I like it, but it is a little too heavy and spicy for my taste. There is a nice tobacco-y &amp;#34;aftertaste&amp;#34; to the scent, which I do like, but all-in-all I prefer the Dominica brand to this and find it be more a more classic bay rum scent. Captain&#x27;s Choice was also more expensive than Dominica.</li>
    <li> I recently tried all 3 Captain&#x27;s Choice Bay Rum after shave scents and they are the best on the market. I live in Southern California and the air can be a bit dry, however the alcohol does not dry my skin. I think \\&quot;The Captain\\&quot; has figured out a formula with the proper amount of witch hazel, alcohol and natural oils... great stuff. Other reviewers have commented on the natural ingredients.  I&#x27;m not a chemist, so I&#x27;ll take their word.  All I know is that my skin feel great after using Captain&#x27;s Choice.  Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very pleasant scent, a little more subdued than Clubman&#x27;s. It is a little heavy on the horehound, though, overpowering the bay rum scent by a bit.</li>
    <li> This is a very pronounce yet subtle Bay Rum aftershave. You get that initial burn but not on a level that really sets your face on fire. The bay leaves and witch hazel really come through and are very telling - nice. It remains rather bold for the first ten minutes or so but settles down to a remote and subtle fragrance that lingers on for at least a couple hours. No, by no means can it be used as a &amp;#34;quickie cologne&amp;#34; - not it&#x27;s purpose at all. But as a very relieving and pleasing aftershave you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one. One of the finest choices available. If only they would make it available in an 8 oz. bottle.</li>
    <li> Excellent scent and feel to my skin. I highly recommend this product! You can&#x27;t go wrong buying this bay rum!</li>
    <li> I usually order Grabel&#x27;s bay rum but I was impressed by all the positive reviews so I tried this brand. A little pricy but worth it, it puts me in mind of royall spice bay rum back when it was no so over priced. Really refreshing and soothing after your shave.Recommended</li>
    <li> Nice product. My husband wears this after shaving and it smells great.</li>
    <li> Nice bay rum aroma but not very long lasting.  Bought Cat-O-Nine Tails previously and actually like it better.  Both have a nice refreshing &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34;.  Dropped a bay leaf in the bottle - not sure how much good it does !</li>
    <li> Very strong and not exactly the cigar shop gentleman appeal I was expecting. It&#x27;s more of an herbal scent like cloves than anything. I plan to try different brands and see what happens. It does great as an aftershave by all means.</li>
    <li> As a dedicated DE shaver, unless i try and like the Cat&#x27;o Nine Tails more, this is my go to Bay Rum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands of bay rum for years.  This product smells like witch hazel and cloves but doesn&#x27;t have the distinct bay rum smell.  I&#x27;m going to stick with Royall brand bay rum, which has a more floral, spicy, and I believe more balanced scent.</li>
    <li> I really, really, wanted to like this so much more than I do. I&#x27;m a big fan of classic shaving scents and was looking forward to this based on the reviews. Simply put, it is much too strong for my skin type. As soon as I use it my face turns bright red and burns horrendously. I might try watering it down a bit with some witch hazel to cut some of the sting. Not a bad product, just not the right one for me.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, it&#x27;s my favorite bay rum yet. As an aftershave, it does an awesome job at soothing your face, very light burn. If you want more of a burn, go for the Cat o&#x27; Nine Tails version of it. Comes in a glass bottle, not plastic like many others. But I wouldn&#x27;t mind a larger volume plastic bottle. Really a wonderful product all around.</li>
    <li> Like the Captain&#x27;s Choice Sandalwood, this is a little too subtle for my tatste.</li>
    <li> Finally have found a practical bay rum which provides a strong, unmistakeable bay rum scent offered with a reasonable pricetag.</li>
    <li> great product, great price</li>
    <li> well... at first it seems overwhelming.... and strooong.. but after a little bit,, it is amazing... if you llike a aftershave that is oldschoold, and not a frilly one like axe,,,then get this one. the  girls will ask about it,, and you will be  in like flin...!!!. just get it, and try it....wear it for one day........trust me...i have tried many and this one is the best......</li>
    <li> This is my dad&#x27;s favorite!  He&#x27;s a big Orvis fan and always liked this.  My daughter gets it for him every Christmas.  That and handkerchiefs.  It&#x27;s a classic for a classic man.</li>
    <li> Look elsewhere, turtle bay or even simple Pinaud.  Doesn&#x27;t last and don&#x27;t love the scent</li>
    <li> Bay Rum smell is ok but not worth the 17.95 a bottle by no means.  I&#x27;ll stick with pinaud virgin island bay rum, my wife cant leave my side when i wear that stuff</li>
    <li> i have never tried bay-rum before, but based on some youtube reviews i decided to order this.......I am not kidding, it is the most disgusting smell i have EVER been exposed to...it smells like spoiled formaldehyde.....i splashed some on my face and immediately went to the bathroom to scrub my face with soap and water....i then immediately threw this stuff in the dumpster......seriously, i don&#x27;t see how anyone can say this stuff smells &amp;#34;good&amp;#34;......</li>
    <li> If you enjoy the dank odor of witch hazel this stuff is for you.&lt;br /&gt;Hey , I know it&#x27;s just like pizza ...what one person loves another wouldn&#x27;t touch. But this stuff has no redeeming qualities in my book....Oh wait--- there&#x27;s one...it has a tight fitting lid.&lt;br /&gt;Sorely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** Can&#x27;t even return it******&lt;br /&gt;Copied from Amazon returns page..&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.

    <li> Love this stuff. Wish it were a little cheaper, but hey it&#x27;s all good. The scent is wonderful and fades pretty fast so you don&#x27;t get sick of it like some other aftershaves (I&#x27;m lookin&#x27; at you Clubman Pinaud). My wife digs it.</li>
    <li> amazon should have automatically issued credit for this product when it was discovered to contain hazardous material. this is my fourth request for amazon to implement higher quality standards procedures. what will it take for amazon to wake up?!</li>
    <li> Still hunting for a replacement for Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27;s bay rum - this ain&#x27;t it. It feels pretty good, but smells a little more like witch hazel than bay rum, and the scent doesn&#x27;t linger long. My skin does feel pretty good though, so that&#x27;s a plus. Will keep using the bottle, but probably won&#x27;t refill.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t dislike it, but I&#x27;ve had better Bay Rum after shave lotions.  I&#x27;ll finish it, but won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I used this aftershave and it is really like nothing I have ever smelled before.  I found myself walking around work asking people to smell my face!  Everyone and I mean everyone was impressed because it is so different.  This will be a permanent part of my shaving kit!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not bad.  Once it dries on the skin the aroma is pleasant, but  Clubman gets the job done just as well for 1/3 the price.  Yes, it&#x27;s a little more distinctive but for me, it&#x27;s just not worth it.  Aftershave/cologne is such a subjective experience that I must insist on noting that this is only my opinion.  Were it not for the cost, I would like it more.  If I had to pick a &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; between Clubman and CC I would have to say...apples and oranges...  both are equally good... TO ME...</li>
    <li> Nothing else like it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff...nice burn that&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I smelled it in the bottle and cant imagine putting it on. Its like patchouli you&#x27;ll love it or hate it.</li>
    <li> smells like witch hazel.  not a bay rum smell at all</li>
    <li> This smells like bay rum, not quite perfect, but good. A little goes a long way, and it works well with my colognes. The seller replaced it after the first was broken in shipping. It looked like a freak accident because it was packaged properly. The replacement was quick and easy.</li>
    <li> It has an ole time smell , suttle and pleasing not perfummy. It had a little more clove smell than I care for but it quickly disperses</li>
    <li> Not impressed. So Says WIFE !!!</li>
    <li> Update:  After using for awhile, it has become a favorite.  Will try to always keep a bottle of this handy.  Try the Captain&#x27;s Choice soap, too.  It&#x27;s every bit as high quality as the aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other people have commented on the quality ingredients and the way their skin felt great after using it, so I&#x27;ll skip commenting on it because I can&#x27;t add any more to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the bottle I was kind of put off by the smell. Very spicy. My wife didn&#x27;t like it either. After wearing it for a couple of hours, I found myself repeatedly smelling my hands trying to figure out what changed that made me like it so much. The next day, I shaved, used the aftershave again, and found that I enjoyed the scent quite a bit. I walked out of the bathroom and walked past my wife who commented about how great I smell. I told her that it was the same aftershave. She then proceeded to let me know just how much she liked the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those people used to normal gillette aftershaves from walmart, this is a whole new level of aftershaves. I believe that&#x27;s what took me off guard. Now that I&#x27;ve been using it for awhile, I find the aftershave to be awesome. My wife comments about how it smells more manly than my old aftershave that I&#x27;ve used for about a decade, Gillette Cool Wave, and wouldn&#x27;t want me to go back. I agree with her.</li>
    <li> Maybe I got a bad unit, but it smelled almost entirely of witch hazel (astringent smell) and almost nothing of rum (no warm, mild spice smell). Won&#x27;t be using it at all, and unfortunately I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Now this is Bay Rum.  It&#x27;s heavy scented, but doesn&#x27;t keel you over with aroma after it dries on your face.</li>
    <li> I very much like the scent of this cologne. It leaves an &amp;#34;Old Fashion&amp;#34; spicy scent on my skin; a scent I really like. I will purchase this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> This may well be the best bay rum in the world, judging by the ingredients listed. People who like bay rum a lot may find this to be wonderful. Apparently I am not one of them. It smells bad when first applied and stings a lot--and I like a little \\&quot;sting\\&quot; after shaving, but this is uncomfortable. A half hour or so after applying it will begin to smell OK, a definite bay aroma that lasts for a while. I could detect no cinnamon, cloves, or anything but bay. I cannot justify the price, and I hate saying that because it looks as though someone tried really hard to make a good product.</li>
    <li> Has a great scent!  One of the best Bay Rum scented products I found</li>
    <li> This is the real deal. A wonderful mixture of spices to give a robust fragrance that lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Captain&#x27;s Choice Bay Rum has a lot of great things going for it, a clear deep amber color and a fresh distinctive aroma all packed in a vintage style bottle.  Pure grain alcohol is mixed with the addition of essential oils, Witch Hazel, and Glycerin helping create a crisp feeling that is not too harsh leaving my skin feeling tight and the oils and glycerin keep my face nourished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not a fan of alcohol, let the aftershave sit in your hands for about 10 seconds, to allow the alcohol to evaporate; what is left is a rich, fresh mellow aroma that has quite the staying power!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line: There are a lot of A/S options to choose from; some of them not only pack quite a punch but also can put an even deeper dent on your wallet. Captain&#x27;s Choice Bay Rum is a product that has tremendous bang for the buck because it works well in soothing my freshly shaven face, and has a refreshing scent with holding power, and at $17.95 for a 4oz bottle, that is just fine for my pocketbook!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I have to agree with the reviewer who complained it made him smell like a ham.  The smell of cloves overpowers everything else in this after shave.  Other reviewers say they slap this on and the ladies flock to them.  That&#x27;s only because the ladies in question were hungry and thought they smelled food.  I like that the ingredient list is short and pronounceable but I can&#x27;t get past the unbalanced scent.</li>
    <li> Smells good when u put it on but does not stay with you.</li>
    <li> I have a couple bay rum soaps I&#x27;ve used that I enjoyed, so based on the positive reviews I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot. Like the other 2 star reviewers though, I guess real strong bay rum isn&#x27;t for me. It&#x27;s offputting.</li>
    <li> Excellent smell, great feeling. Don&#x27;t hesitate on this purchase.</li>
    <li> CC Bay Rum is now my standard cologne as it smells clean and fresh and is longer-lasting than any other Bay Rum I have tried. The Cat o Nine Tails is good for evening as it is stronger still.</li>
    <li> Bought this looking for that &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; barber shop scent. When I received this and unscrewed the top, I was a little put off, as it did not smell anything like the spicey/sweet scent that I was looking for. Smelling from the bottle it had an antiseptic quality. That could have been the witch hazel, or the essential oils and extracts. I put the bottle on the shelf, and occasionally would go back and sniff it again, with the same thoughts of antiseptic. After a few days, upon shaving I put some on my neck, cheeks, arms as I would with cologne or any other aftershave. After about 5 or 10 minutes, boy was I surprised. The Captain&#x27;s choice took on a whole new scent. It has a warm, mellow, slightly cinnamon and vanilla smell. It&#x27;s become almost addictive in it&#x27;s scent. I love it. This is not like Stephan&#x27;s or Pinaud, which are the sweet spicey types of bay rum (which are just as great). Captain&#x27;s Choice is an entirely different bay rum scent that is a must have if you are into bay rums. I will be ordering another bottle or two very soon. I wish they had a larger bottle, and maybe a cologne version that lasted a while longer.</li>
    <li> The scent is wonderful. There is a significant burn when it first goes on, but then the skin has an almost numbing feel, and it becomes soothing. I really enjoy bay rum scents and this one is near the top. The only downside is that, like most bay rums, the scent does not stay around too long. But the skin feels great afterwards.</li>
    <li> This stuff is disappointing. The scent isn&#x27;t the best bay rum I&#x27;ve smelled, by a long way, and it doesn&#x27;t last that long.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying Captain&#x27;s Choice again.</li>
    <li> An invigorating, classic masculine scent, soothes skin and leaves it feeling refreshed.  Pure bay rum pleasure, with skin care second to none.</li>
    <li> My husband is so very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> As a whole new generation discovers the virtues of DE shaving (and a whole old generation rediscovers the same thing), they need to discover the virtues of the classic aftershaves. And what better way than Captain&#x27;s Choice Aftershaves. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;ll occasionally splash on the $30 an oz. flavor of the month but as a daily aftershave you can&#x27;t beat this. And it&#x27;s not all about smell. An aftershave first must condition your skin after abusing it with a sharp piece of steel &amp; Captain&#x27;s Choice is formulated to do just that. The fragrance is a personal choice &amp; although I use all of them, this Bay Rum is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Great product. This is 100% genuine Bay Rum. The smell, the refreshing stinging feel after you splash it on... everything about this product is perfect. I typically use Ogallala Bay Rum and sandalwood, or Pinaud Bay Rum, but this one will gain access into my rotation for sure.&lt;br /&gt;I have read some negative reviews about this product and Bay Rum in general, and I will say this: this stuff is not for the faint hearted, or some trendy hipster looking for the new fad with men&#x27;s grooming products. (it was beard balm, beard oil, mustache wax, etc.) This is for GENTLEMEN who enjoy wet shaving, and that brisk, cinnamon, rum &amp; cedar woodsy smell. If you&#x27;re looking for the metrosexual cologne smell, look else where, &#x27;cos you&#x27;ll hate this product.  Ogallala, Captain&#x27;s Choice and Clubman... you just can&#x27;t go wrong :)</li>
    <li> Wow,what a crap is that?</li>
    <li> The scent is an acquired taste. When I first smelled it my first impression was that scene from Ron Burgundy (go back and watch it - funny). It grows on you, though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different bay rum aftershaves and Captain&#x27;s Choice blows them all away in both scent and performance. It is now my only bay rum and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for the summertime. I prefer a balm for the winter. The Bay rum is a nice musky scent, but it is still good for a younger guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will give you a nice burn after a wet shave, but I think it feels good. I think this is a good manly scent to have around, and I will buy it again. I just ran out.</li>
    <li> I bought this scent because the reviews were so glowing and they said that it didn&#x27;t have a strong clove scent... uh, review fail. First off - the cap was loose in the packaging so some of the contents had leaked out, at least it was in a sealed plastic baggie or the delivery driver would be smelling like it for days. My first impression was of my mom&#x27;s Easter ham, which she covers judiciously in cloves and spices. Really? To be fair though, I tried it on my face. Burns like rubbing alcohol on a skinned knee, smells like cloves and booze. The scent is sweet and strong and cloying. I had some Col. Conks shaving soap and the bay rum scent is very pleasant, but Captain&#x27;s Choice is like a bay rum drop kick to the face.</li>
    <li> I have had no other Bay Rum aftershaves, but the reviews led me to this product. Definitely has a kick, but also a very pleasant aroma that resurfaces throughout the day. An old-fashioned aftershave for no-nonsense men.</li>
    <li> For an aftershave, this and the same manufacture&#x27;s Lime are my two favorites.  This contains all the right ingredients, including witch hazel.  If you get razor burn or bumps, this helps immensely.  It is a bit on the pricey side for an aftershave, but if you love the bay rum scent, this is it.  There is a bit of bite to it, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming.  The website for the company does offer samples, so if you don&#x27;t want to take the plunge on the seventeen bucks, search for the company website and you can order a sample of all their aftershaves.  Amazon does have the best prices if you are a prime member.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for myself as I was hoping to enjoy the smell. Being uncertain of the smells, I should have purchased a sample pack of their different scents. Once I received it, I must admit that I did not enjoy the smell. While I wanted to and tried it on a few different times, I just could not come past the smell. I did end up offering it to a friend as a gift that likes these types of scents, and he thoroughly enjoyed the smell. While not for me (more of a refreshing aqua types scents), my friend is now hooked on the product.</li>
    <li> This Bay Rum product smells pretty good, however the packaging differs significantly that pictured. It has no seal, and came wrapped in a bubble wrap envelope. I have nothing to compare it too, so I hope it&#x27;s the same product, and not a refilled bottle.....</li>
    <li> I love the after shave.  Only issue is that its pricey.</li>
    <li> This smells manly but doesn&#x27;t make me smell like an old man.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Big fan of Bay Rum but this one fades to quick.  Hopefully will someday find one with some lasting power.</li>
    <li> This splash is pleasantly noticeable but not overpowering.  Smells good, even towards the end of the day.  I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I wonder if I got a bad bottle? This has almost no odor or aroma compared to the 5 other Bay Rums I have tried. Feels OK on the face. Seems over-priced to me. Will stick with Pinaud and Dominica bay rums. Won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiancee&#x27; and HE likes it. I find that it&#x27;s just ok.  Delivery was AWESOME!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big Bay Rum fan and have quite a few in my rotation, however Captain&#x27;s Choice is certainly a notch above the rest. The scent is a great blend of spices, clove (not too much), citrus...all the good stuff that makes it a BR. The effect on the face is wonderful, good initial BR \\&quot;burn\\&quot; but actually feels refreshing on the skin. In addition to the alcohol content, it also contains witch hazel and glycerin which help to heal and condition my face superbly. No matter where I&#x27;m at, no matter where I go, the Captain is always a part of my shaving routine...Would certainly recommend this BR to all novices and fans of this type of scent...Captain&#x27;s Choice is THE choice.</li>
    <li> The new label on this Captain&#x27;s Choice Bay Rum also represents the new formula that is not nearly as good as the previous version.  The old version was richer, stronger, smelled better, and felt better after a shave.  The new version has no sting and the scent does not have the depth that it used to.  I paid $40 for the original bottle---and would pay it again---but not $20 for this new recipe.  I have a little of the old bottle left over, and after noticing a difference in the scent when the new one arrived, I put the old version on one side of my face and the new version on the other.  Each felt very different, and my wife and daughter both agreed that the new one does not smell as good as the old.  The old bottle had an off-white label with a picture of bay leaves on the front, and sported a script font.</li>
    <li> Wish it had at least a touch of clove, but really like it just the same, thanks!</li>
    <li> After using the Ogallala bay rums (bought the sampler pack), I have decided to get this one and try it out. This bay rum has more of a &amp;#34;bay&amp;#34; smell to it, which I like personally, whereas the Ogallala Bay Rum has a stronger clove-cinnamon smell. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love the Ogallala bay rums. They are really great products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for some reason, the captain&#x27;s bay rum does not burn my face as much as the Ogallala bay rums do, which I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to choose between the two, I would give a slight edge toward the captain. Great Product!</li>
    <li> Now I know Bay Rum really isn&#x27;t my thing. No matter where I looked online I saw mostly really good feedback on Captain&#x27;s Choice products, so I ordered the sample pack from their website. I found the Original to be a great product, and now I know that regular Bay Rum isn&#x27;t quite my thing. Like everyone else tells you, these will make your face feel great. The burn level here falls between the Cat O Nine Tails (which of course is supposed to burn) and the other Captain&#x27;s products, which indicates to me that some essential oils typically used in Bay Rum products will burn sensitive skin (in fact they seem to burn me more than the alcohol contained in an aftershave). Nonetheless, the burn wasn&#x27;t terrible , and the  product made my face feel great. Also, the rave reviews The Captain has received inspired me to apply Witch Hazel (a key ingredient in Captain&#x27;s Choice aftershave lotions)  between the end of my shave and the application of my actual aftershave (which turned out to be a great idea, though ironically I found I still preferred to take this step even when using the Captain&#x27;s products even though they contain Witch Hazel themselves). Anyway as a Bay Rum scent goes, this is pretty pleasant. Its sweet and spicy, but not overpowering. However, its still almost a &amp;#34;gourmond&amp;#34; scent, I mostly smell cinnamon, clove (though they do NOT use clove), a tiny bit of sweet vanilla, and maybe a vague hint of orange peel. Its not objectionable, but not quite the scent aura that I personally try to project. So regular Bay Rum is out for me, but I think this is a must try for any fan of Bay Rum So it still gets 4 stars. Actually, do yourself a favor and get the entire sample pack like I did. It&#x27;s only $14 and then you&#x27;ll get to try everything the Captain has to offer.</li>
    <li> As an aftershave (from a functional perspective), this product hits all the right buttons.  Minimal ingredients, nothing you can&#x27;t pronounce: Alcohol, witch hazel, oils &amp; extracts, glycerin.  It works great. After a good shave, my face feels amazing -- and it stays that way the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the package arrived, I took the bottle out and my wife asked about it. I told her I had wanted to try it, and that the Amazon consensus seemed to be that it smelled bad out of the bottle, but was much better after application.  So of course, we both smelled it out of the bottle, and it was disgusting. It&#x27;s exacerbated by the fact that I really don&#x27;t like the smell of clove, and this stuff REEKS of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I applied it after my next shave. Just as many people had said, the scent mellowed in about 15 minutes to something quite different.  The scent was still dominated by clove, but it was no longer JUST clove. My wife said she liked the scent, that it was nothing like the way it smelled in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I use it, it grows on me a little more.  I find myself missing the scent when it eventually dissipates beyond my ability to detect it. However, there&#x27;s still a nagging thing -- I&#x27;m currently shaving with the [[ASIN:B002JKSP38 bay rum scented Colonel Conk soap]], and I really like the way that one smells.  I find myself still wishing that I had an aftershave that could provide a longer lasting variation of that scent. The scent seems to have nothing in common with this aftershave.  So while the scent of the aftershave has definitely grown on me (and as I said, I LOVE the way it performs) I still find myself holding out hope that one day I&#x27;ll be able to find a similarly great aftershave that&#x27;s more in line with the type of bay rum scent I prefer.</li>
    <li> My son put me onto this.  Smells natural and good.  No fume headaches as with other after shaves.  Nice clean aroma.</li>
    <li> One of the best bay rum aftershaves on the market.  Not too much clove or spice.  After the initial bracing disinfectant does it&#x27;s work, the burn fades and the splash has great skin care properties.  Especially great in the hot summer!</li>
    <li> This is the first &amp;#34;artisan&amp;#34; after shave I have tried.  What a difference compared to the store bought piss water.  Ol</li>
    <li> This stuff stinks. A dirty fish market smells better.  Extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am on a bit of tear, trying all the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; barber shop products. I am trying each product for a day or two, independent of any other products just so I can get feel for each one. I purchased this because the reviews for Clubman Bay Rum said that it was not a real &amp;#34;Bay Rum,&amp;#34; and I wanted to know what that might be. This has a different scent than the Clubman product, more stringent is the only way that I can describe it. That is probably the witch-hazel. I have used witch-hazel to freshen up since I was a teenager so I was excited to find it here. I like the natural ingredients compared to the Clubman product, just not the scent, and at $15 a bottle... There is just not enough here to purchase it again, (no wow!) but I won&#x27;t throw it out, because,you never know, it might grow on me.</li>
    <li> As I have returned to shaving with a safety razor and whipping my shaving cream in a bowl, I was searching for classic after shave.  The Bay Rum fits the bill! It&#x27;s priced reasonably and has a refreshing touch when splashing on after a nice close shave. The scent reminds me of Clove gum, it&#x27;s subtle, not overwhelming.  A nice touch for casual days, or after shave when just hanging out.</li>
    <li> Everyone else has already sung the praises of this.  It&#x27;s great.  Buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other bay rum aftershaves and they aren&#x27;t bad. Based on the almost universally positive reviews this one gets I went ahead and gave it a try. The bottle is nice, it has quality ingredients, but I can&#x27;t stand the smell. I tried it a few times to give it a fair shot but this just isn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how to describe the smell, it&#x27;s very distinctive and very strong. It reminds me more of a savory cooking ingredient than an aftershave. If you are not a big fan of bay rum aftershaves I would skip this one.</li>
    <li> I love the pure bay rum scent, and how it lets the spice come through without any clove that others think is needed as a top note. No perfume type scent here, just spice and bay rum.</li>
    <li> Not only the scent is great and truly fantastic, but also the consistency of the product is very thick, but at the same time without leaving and oily residue on the face. Its warm and mild and doesn&#x27;t sting! Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of bay rum aftershaves. This one strikes a very nice balance between sweet and spicy, reminds me of Dominica Bay Rum (one of my favorites), but without the harsher burn. The bottle is a nice size too - fits in a dopp kit easily - and it has a little stopper to prevent you from pouring out too much at once (one of my complaints about Dominica Bay Rum). Will definitely be purchasing again, as well as trying the other Captain&#x27;s Choice fragrances.</li>
    <li> This was the old school shave and smell that my teenage son was looking for.  He revels in all that is economical.</li>
    <li> Captain&#x27;s Choice Bay Rum burns. It doesn&#x27;t burn like Old Spice. Or like witch hazel. Or even like rubbing alcohol. Captain&#x27;s Choice burns like molten lead, trickling down your face, and you will love it. It smells absolutely fantastic, and the smell persists faintly into the evening. It&#x27;s great stuff. Not that many people wear this scent, either, so you&#x27;ll definitely have a unique smell. If you aren&#x27;t familiar with bay rum, give it a shot. It&#x27;s a very distinct smell, and it&#x27;s my go-to aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the burn is gone (which usually takes about 10-20 seconds), the skin feels fresh, clean, and invigorated. It has great disinfectant properties, so if you&#x27;re prone to breakouts or ingrown hairs, it may be a strong choice for you. I have sensitive, dry skin, and I follow this up with a touch of Trader Joe&#x27;s moisturizer, and I don&#x27;t feel like my skin has been dried out at all.</li>
    <li> My amazingly sexy husband is even more amazingly sexy now!</li>
    <li> Is that a word: clovish? I don&#x27;t know, but it seems to me that Bay Rum scents come in two different iterations: the clove laden and the non-clove laden. An example of the non-clove is C.O. BIGELOW No. 032 BAY RUM COLOGNE FOR MEN 2.5 fl oz/75 ml, while Captain&#x27;s Choice Bay Rum is a clove-rich scent. IMO, I like them both. They are different. The scent is exactly the same as [[ASIN:B00A0J4RS2 Captain&#x27;s Choice Cat O&#x27; Nine Tails Bay Rum 4.0 oz After Shave Pour]]. It is very intense at the onset, but mellows nicely for a long-lasting scent the women will adore. The old-fashioned apothecary bottle is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> Great long lasting scent.</li>
    <li> My favorite bay rum along with Clubman. Price is a little on the high end but my face loves it. The ingredients most likely the which hazel has removed all my razor bumps and has kept my face moisturized.</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my husband.  He loved it and then again, so did I.  I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll be wanting more.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, all natural, smells good, and works with cologne, doesn&#x27;t clash.</li>
    <li> Captain&#x27;s choice is mild,and  the scent does not linger long,therefore it cannot be compared to &amp;#34;that barbershop smell&amp;#34;. If you want something stronger,check the other brands.</li>
    <li> Clove clove clove, clove clove. Clove- clove clove clove, clove and clove. Clove clove clove.</li>
    <li> Real bay rum, no chemicals, no cloves.. Just a rich but mild bay rum scent, the witch hazel and distilled bay leaf oil is a natural astringent and great for your skin, it tightens and sooths my face after a two or three pass straight razor shave.. My face feels really good..Scent is strong for a short 20 -30 minits, but she can still smell it a couple hours later, if she snuggles in, and wearing this stuff she will...bottle has a silicone dropper under cap so you won&#x27;t over pour..I highly recommend this..</li>
    <li> Simply the best aftershave I have ever bought. Money well spent! My girlfriend loves the mild smell.</li>
    <li> Have never used an alcohol based aftershave before. I was really impressed. Gives you skin a nice feeling. Doesn&#x27;t get your skin an oily or shiny look.</li>
    <li> I really like Burts Bay Rum Aftershave but it&#x27;s been discontinued so is very expensive to buy on Amazon.  I really like that this company uses only essential oils and extracts.  It does feel nice on the face but, for me, the aroma is lacking in some way.  I would suggest purchasing one of their trial sizes from their website (or maybe Amazon) to see if you like it before you buy this full size bottle.  It&#x27;s a fine bargain as the stuff seems to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I&#x27;ll try a different product.  I don&#x27;t really have a problem with this stuff, it just didn&#x27;t really float my boat.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer.. This was my 1st purchase of any product of bay rum scent. I purchased this along with a bottle of lime scent. I would have to say the product works, burn, and soothing afterwards. However the bay rum scent is powerful and not very present. I haven&#x27;t compared this bay rum vs any other so I don&#x27;t know what it is supposed to smell like but for any indication , my wife told me, &amp;#34;what is that horrible smell&amp;#34; after telling her it was my after shave she said &amp;#34;throw it away&amp;#34;. The lime version was pleasant and I did enjoy that version, same brand so ..a bit pricey to get that kinda response from my ole lady.  Thanx and just being honest here hope it helps.</li>
    <li> A great classic Bay rum scent. It is not too overpowering from a clove scent but a mix of classic fragrance oils that smells nice. The only downfall I found is that the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic! Smells great... clove and bay.</li>
    <li> About six months ago, I walked into a well-known fragrance shop in Cambridge, MA and took a sniff of the Captain&#x27;s Choice Bay Rum.  I had seen many glowing posts about this stuff on the Badger and Blade shaving forum, and was interested in giving it a shot.  But the smell was . . . well . . . awful.  Needless to say, I didn&#x27;t buy it.  A little while later, I was lucky enough to get a pre-production sample of Captain&#x27;s Choice&#x27;s newest aftershave, [[ASIN:B00CLPV3M6 Captain&#x27;s Choice Lime Aftershave 4oz after shave]].  This early version was more of a lime bay rum, whereas the final Lime is pure lime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I burned through that sample in no time flat. I loved the way it smelled (and more importantly, so did my wife).  Even better, I loved the way it made my face FEEL.  Every one of the Captain&#x27;s products provides unparalleled face feel after a shave--first a gentle burn, then a sweet, soft, smooth, silky loveliness.  When the sample ran out, I found myself craving it.  Lime wasn&#x27;t out yet, so I pulled the trigger on the Bay Rum.  In the bottle, meh.  On my face?  Heaven. The smell is complex, sweet, deep, long-lasting but not overpowering (I get lovely hints of it throughout the day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, the ingredients are all-natural.  Such a simple product, such a perfect result.  You owe it to yourself to try this.  Then, you will soon branch out--like I did--to the stronger, warmer, spicier [[ASIN:B00A0J4RS2 Cat o&#x60; Nine Tails Bay Rum Aftershave 4oz after shave by Captain&#x27;s Choice]], and the sweet, summery [[ASIN:B00CLPV3M6 Captain&#x27;s Choice Lime Aftershave 4oz after shave]].</li>
    <li> Great aftershave!  I read all the reviews and decided to give it a go. I must agreed with one of the other reviews who said they were very unsure about it when you first smell it in the bottle.  But put it on your face and sooooo much better. Makes my face feel great.  Minimal burn. My wife loves the smell but it is not overpowering.  I find the scent is much more even if I shake the bottle before I apply it. I will definitely buy again and can&#x27;t wait to try the lime.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Bay Rum fan for many years and I can honestly say this is one of the best.  The scent is not over powering and lasts much longer than any other product I&#x27;ve used. I use safety razors and enjoy the most aggresive ones I can find.  This being said the \\&quot;burn\\&quot; from the Captain&#x27;s Choice is nothing to fear.  You get great value for the money.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best Bay Rum aftershave I have used. If you are fan of bay rum you must buy this product immediately. I have gotten the most complements from the ladies wearing this aftershave then with any other product on the market. Plus it feels amazing after your shaves.</li>
    <li> My favorite. Nice pleasing clean scent.</li>
    <li> Love the By Rum scent and this product works fantastic.....It is the only aftershave I use and well worth the price!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent replacement for my old bay rum which I can only find in lime (yuck).  I like the intense scent which calms down after a few minutes.  A good non-musky man&#x27;s aftershave and cologne!  Reminds me a little of the old fashioned barber shop instead of the &amp;#34;Salons&amp;#34; guys go to.  My wife likes it, A LOT.  She says I smell like a Man!</li>
    <li> I love Captain&#x27;s Choice -- originally it took me a couple of days to get used to it, but now I&#x27;m hooked (so to speak) on it.  It has a masculine, 19th century kind of scent, very natural and complex.  Feels like it does a good job of disinfecting my skin after a shave and gives you a good, bracing \\&quot;whoo!\\&quot; kind of feeling when you splash it on.</li>
    <li> I hate buying things like aftershaves and colognes off the internet because I can&#x27;t smell them. If you don&#x27;t know what Bay Rum smells like, I would go to the store and try some other stuff first as this is a very uncommon scent now. Bay rum used to be very popular back in the day and now it&#x27;s starting to become popular again because of the resurgence of classic wet shaving.    So what does Bay Rum smell like? If you can&#x27;t find it at your local store I will try to best describe it. Bay run smells like herbal spices with a touch of citrus and a little sweet. I was a bit taken aback by it at first because I am used to more contemporary citrus and floral based smells. If scents could have high notes and low notes, I would consider bay rum a deep note. This is a very classy and masculine scent. The more I use it, the more it grows on me.    So how does it feel? Great. I think this is my favorite feeling aftershave. It&#x27;s alcohol based but it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. It has a little burn from the alcohol when you first apply it, but then the witch hazel and glycerin kick in to really clam the skin down. The alcohol is not a bad thing as it disinfects your face and prevents infections. I hope the Captain starts making other more contemporary scents because I would buy those in a heartbeat. I have some of Mr. Fine&#x27;s aftershaves that smell awesome, check out [[ASIN:B00H4CR2MG Fine Classic After Shave American Blend]] or [[ASIN:B00KKX4STQ Fine Classic After Shave Platinum]], but I think Captain&#x27;s Choice has the better face feel because of the smoothing witch hazel and glycerin.</li>
    <li> My prior review of this somehow got deleted so I will write it again. The gentleman who claims that the formula has changed doesn&#x27;t know what he is talking about. I asked the man who makesthis stuff personally and he said that he hasn&#x27;t changed anything. It smells good. I wished I would have discovered this in high school.</li>
    <li> This is a nice aftershave.  It is cooling and feels great on the skin.  I&#x27;m not sure exactly what I&#x27;d call the fragrance, but it is unlike any bay rum I&#x27;ve ever used before.  It&#x27;s a fresh, spicy scent, but if you are looking for real bay rum, best to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I am a big Bay Rum fan.  I have tried many, if not most of them.  Nothing else comes close to this Bay Rum.  The Best.  Period.</li>
    <li> You are going to think I am crazy, but I am sometimes motivated to shave just so I can put some of this on my face.  It really feels good, and the smell is addictive.  Wish they had 6 stars.</li>
    <li> Did not care for the smell.</li>
