      <li>so this is perfect for me and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great!</li>
      <li>This is a good product!</li>
      <li>This stick is great.</li>
      <li>Good price, does was it is supposed to.</li>
      <li>These Stainguard sticks do a good job</li>
      <li>The stuff doesn&#x27;t smell good either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Which is good.</li>
      <li>Smells good too.</li>
      <li>I was happy to find it on Amazon and have been pleased with the quality of the product.  </li>
      <li>I was happy with Adidas t-shirt safe deodorant, but I can&#x27;t find it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but, the most reason why I would not buy this product on amazon is THE PRICE!  </li>
      <li>excellent, organized, and fast shipping</li>
      <li>By far the best deodorant for me.</li>
      <li>I purchased a bunch when Cub Foods went out of business (Dayton, OH), but was stumped to find more, before accidently discovering it&#x27;s availability via the  internet.</li>
      <li>I need to look great in front of high end customers!  </li>
      <li>Needly to say, I am more than satisfied with the performance of Mennen Stainguard.</li>
      <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite anti-perspirant yet.  </li>
      <li>, it mostly comes out.</li>
      <li>I start sweating more.  </li>
      <li>After so many years in which I&#x27;ve suffered from strong perpiration, SpeedStick Stainguard came to solve my problem.</li>
      <li>Has a light but clean smell.</li>
      <li>the gel is smooth, easy to apply and does not stain and works as it is intended to do---keep you smelling fresh all day.  </li>
      <li>I have many favorite shirts which are no longer wearable from the old speed stick.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, it lasts all day long, nice and fresh smell, no nasty stains on my clothes.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no big deal in that it can be washed off, but you might need to change your outfit since it doesn&#x27;t look as good anymore.&lt;br</li>
      <li>stuff works pretty well, and it does not stain!</li>
      <li>Been using for a few years now and am happy with it.</li>
      <li>it also irritates my skin, I was having to use talc as well to calm my skin, this speedstick feels sticky under arm.</li>
      <li>However, I have had a great deal of trouble finding it on the shelf.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s job for 24 hours, smells okay, and doesn&#x27;t leave the deodorant stains on my shirts like the old speed stick does.</li>
      <li>different packaging but the same great product.</li>
      <li>Great product and hard to find in the stores.</li>
      <li>, this is the first one to take over.</li>
      <li>This might not leave white stains, but it sure leaves oil like stains on the clothes</li>
      <li>Most deodorant/antiperspirant will make dingy pit stains and if you don&#x27;t get it dry cleaned right away</li>
      <li>Order extra because it isn&#x27;t easy to find.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really want to do that with all of my colored</li>
      <li>More importantly, I&#x27;ve noticed less of the underarm rash caused by alcohol based sprays and by the higher concentrations of aluminum in other antiperspirants.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have spent years trying to find something better than my old trusty</li>
      <li>Does a decent job of preventing shirt yellowing.</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s changed many times searching for one that doesn&#x27;t mess up his shirts or leave the \\&quot;salt marks\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend Speed Stick Stainguard.</li>
      <li>24hrs protection is a joke, this product works for little more than 4hrs and that is without breaking a sweat.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t work as well as normal speed stick.</li>
      <li>maybe the stains aren&#x27;t yellow, but this product has ruined every T-shirt I own in less than 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;Looking for a new product.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t live without this and am now resorting to ordering online.</li>
      <li>Works better than other similar products in fighting underarm staining on t-shirts.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not exactly too sure if this product works with the white shirt stains, I don&#x27;t wear those that often</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a heavy sweater, but I manage to pit out in every meeting.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>the stick also cakes and doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well.  </li>
      <li>the first thing-they are not clearly marked whether they are gel or stick.</li>
      <li>This really works fighting yellow stains on t-shirts!</li>
      <li>Even so, the discoloration is so faint that inspection in fairly strong, direct light is necessary to see anything at all.  </li>
      <li>you Spray and Wash the pit stains, and run the shirts through on extra hot, on a long cycle</li>
      <li>Prior to that, nearly all my shirts had those white streaks/stains accross them.  </li>
      <li>saw some photos of me recently, and the dark pit stains are very noticeable.</li>
      <li>the stick is very hard to use, does not go on smoothly, it chafes the skin.</li>

<li> Given my usual success with the product, I&#x27;d suggest that these were my fault, trying to get by with using too little of the antiperspirant.  </li>
<li> Not clear which is what I wanted.</li>
<li> Avoid this stuff, I only used it for about 2 weeks and within that short time it ruined 3 shirts with black stains in the armpits.</li>
<li> This product makes two claims that it does not live up to:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
<li> stuff leaves big greasy, waxy dark marks in your shirt arm pits.</li>
<li> My white undershirts have noticed less caking with this product.</li>
<li> Not only does it not protect against yellow stain, but within 10 minutes of putting it on, BEFORE leaving my house, I could already see a small sweat stain underneath my arm.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using speed stick stainguard for years now and find that my undershirts last significantly longer than with other deodorants (before the pit stains get too bad to wear the shirts).  </li>
<li> In the past, I have had several sport shirts ruined by staining casused by underarm deoderant.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m a skinny guy, heavy sweater, because you wanted to know.</li>
<li> This stuff is actually worse than regular</li>
<li> but unfortunately I found it its ruined a few of my shirts and put black greasy stains in the place of yellow.</li>
<li> I sweat real bad, and I need deodorant that can stop most of the sweat from staining my shirt, at the very least do away with yellow stains and also the puddle underneath my arms.</li>
<li> But since I&#x27;ve started using this product, no more whate stains.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product exclsively for the past two years.  </li>
<li> No more.</li>
<li> I mean, my pits still stain my undershirts over time</li>
<li> may just be one of those people who sweats through everything no matter what, but I expect something from my deodorant besides yellow stains and bad odor.</li>
<li> the price is ridiculous!  </li>
<li> I buy expensive shirts for work, sometimes $200 each.  </li>
<li> My t-shirts are slightly less disgusting under the arm because of this stuff.</li>
<li> I wore 3 shirts that day because it was cold, didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
<li> do these vendors think we are stupid?  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works better than other similar products in fighting underarm staining on t-shirts. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> different packaging but the same great product.</li>
    <li> It works, I sweat a lot, it does it&#x27;s job for 24 hours, smells okay, and doesn&#x27;t leave the deodorant stains on my shirts like the old speed stick does. I have many favorite shirts which are no longer wearable from the old speed stick. This stuff is great! Order extra because it isn&#x27;t easy to find. I ordered a couple dozen just in case it is discontinued. I have spent years trying to find something better than my old trusty, this is the first one to take over.</li>
    <li> 24hrs protection is a joke, this product works for little more than 4hrs and that is without breaking a sweat. My wife uses my anti-persp as well and she found the same issue and she sits at a desk all day in an air-con room. For me (and I realise this is a personal thing) it also irritates my skin, I was having to use talc as well to calm my skin, this speedstick feels sticky under arm. In the end I had to stop using it as i began to get a rash.</li>
    <li> This really works fighting yellow stains on t-shirts!</li>
    <li> I like this product, but after using it, I still sweat from the armpits when I drive my car after about an hour. I&#x27;m not exactly too sure if this product works with the white shirt stains, I don&#x27;t wear those that often anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what I&#x27;ve noticed is that when I try wearing color shirts, when I try putting them on and some of the deodorant smears on it (even after 30 minutes of putting the deodorant), the shirt with the smeared spots are noticeable since they get darker and they look a bit like stains. There&#x27;s no big deal in that it can be washed off, but you might need to change your outfit since it doesn&#x27;t look as good anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell though.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite anti-perspirant yet.  He&#x27;s changed many times searching for one that doesn&#x27;t mess up his shirts or leave the \\&quot;salt marks\\&quot;.  He has me looking all over the place to find it and won&#x27;t use anything else.  Needless-to-say, I am having to mail-order it now since all of the stores here have stopped carrying it.</li>
    <li> No, I&#x27;ve never had the stuff hold up for 24 consecutive hours.  But then, I&#x27;ve not yet found any antiperspirant that does.  And I can perspire rather heavily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for staining, every undershirt that I&#x27;ve ever owned has eventually gotten those glaring brownish gold stains under the arms until I started using the Mennen Speed Stick Stainguard.  After switching to it (almost two years ago) not one t-shirt has become even moderately stained.  Admittedly, a couple have gotten an almost unnoticeable yellow tint.  Given my usual success with the product, I&#x27;d suggest that these were my fault, trying to get by with using too little of the antiperspirant.  Even so, the discoloration is so faint that inspection in fairly strong, direct light is necessary to see anything at all.  Needly to say, I am more than satisfied with the performance of Mennen Stainguard.</li>
    <li> excellent, organized, and fast shipping</li>
    <li> My white undershirts have noticed less caking with this product. More importantly, I&#x27;ve noticed less of the underarm rash caused by alcohol based sprays and by the higher concentrations of aluminum in other antiperspirants.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t live without this and am now resorting to ordering online.</li>
    <li> This product makes two claims that it does not live up to:&lt;br /&gt;1. \\&quot;24 hr protection\\&quot;- not even close. I&#x27;m not a heavy sweater, but I manage to pit out in every meeting.&lt;br /&gt;2. \\&quot;Staingaurd, fights yellow stains\\&quot;- maybe the stains aren&#x27;t yellow, but this product has ruined every T-shirt I own in less than 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;Looking for a new product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product exclsively for the past two years.  Prior to that, nearly all my shirts had those white streaks/stains accross them.  If you are in the practice of applying your doederant after you&#x27;ve put your shirt on this is an especially likely occurance.  But since I&#x27;ve started using this product, no more whate stains.</li>
    <li> This product keeps you dry.&lt;br /&gt;It also helps avoid staining white T-shirts.&lt;br /&gt;It is my preferred choice to look for at the store.</li>
    <li> I sweat real bad, and I need deodorant that can stop most of the sweat from staining my shirt, at the very least do away with yellow stains and also the puddle underneath my arms. Keep looking because this is the most useless brand of deo I have ever seen. Not only does it not protect against yellow stain, but within 10 minutes of putting it on, BEFORE leaving my house, I could already see a small sweat stain underneath my arm. I wore 3 shirts that day because it was cold, didn&#x27;t work at all. The stuff doesn&#x27;t smell good either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may just be one of those people who sweats through everything no matter what, but I expect something from my deodorant besides yellow stains and bad odor.</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant stick that does not cake on my undershirts.</li>
    <li> I like this because it does not stain my golf shirts. Great product and hard to find in the stores.</li>
    <li> the first thing-they are not clearly marked whether they are gel or stick. the stick is very hard to use, does not go on smoothly, it chafes the skin. the stick also cakes and doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well.  the gel is smooth, easy to apply and does not stain and works as it is intended to do---keep you smelling fresh all day.  but, the most reason why I would not buy this product on amazon is THE PRICE!  the price is ridiculous!  do these vendors think we are stupid?  it cost between 2.50 and 3.00 at walmart.  one had it priced around 24 dollars plus they had the nerve to say it was 8 dollar under list.  who are you kidding?  I buy amazon to save money besides the convenience of home delivery</li>
    <li> By far the best deodorant for me. And in my experience it does reduce the amount of staining on my clothes. Been using for a few years now and am happy with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using speed stick stainguard for years now and find that my undershirts last significantly longer than with other deodorants (before the pit stains get too bad to wear the shirts).  I was happy to find it on Amazon and have been pleased with the quality of the product.  I highly recommend Speed Stick Stainguard.</li>
    <li> Good price, does was it is supposed to. Not clear which is what I wanted. I am allergic to something in antiperspirant gels so this is perfect for me and lasts all day. I&#x27;m a skinny guy, heavy sweater, because you wanted to know.</li>
    <li> After so many years in which I&#x27;ve suffered from strong perpiration, SpeedStick Stainguard came to solve my problem. It&#x27;s easy to use, it lasts all day long, nice and fresh smell, no nasty stains on my clothes.</li>
    <li> My t-shirts are slightly less disgusting under the arm because of this stuff. Which is good.</li>
    <li> These Stainguard sticks do a good job and I have seen no &amp;#34;glaze&amp;#34; on my shirts. This is a good product!</li>
    <li> In the past, I have had several sport shirts ruined by staining casused by underarm deoderant.  Having discovered this stuff, I want nothing else.  However, I have had a great deal of trouble finding it on the shelf.  I purchased a bunch when Cub Foods went out of business (Dayton, OH), but was stumped to find more, before accidently discovering it&#x27;s availability via the  internet.</li>
    <li> I specifically purchased this product to prevent yellow stains on shirts but unfortunately I found it its ruined a few of my shirts and put black greasy stains in the place of yellow. Also it&#x27;s supposed to be an antiperspirant but for some reason after I put it on I start sweating more.  I&#x27;m contacting the company to complain.</li>
    <li> I used to use regular deodorant, and got a lot of brown stains from the metal powders in them. I was happy with Adidas t-shirt safe deodorant, but I can&#x27;t find it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff leaves big greasy, waxy dark marks in your shirt arm pits. After washing the shirts, you can rub your fingernail on these patches and wax comes off as it would a candle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you Spray and Wash the pit stains, and run the shirts through on extra hot, on a long cycle, it mostly comes out. I don&#x27;t really want to do that with all of my colored shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw some photos of me recently, and the dark pit stains are very noticeable. This stuff is actually worse than regular deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it for 6 months. No more.</li>
    <li> I buy expensive shirts for work, sometimes $200 each.  I need to look great in front of high end customers!  Most deodorant/antiperspirant will make dingy pit stains and if you don&#x27;t get it dry cleaned right away it will become a permenant stain!  Yuck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works pretty well, and it does not stain!</li>
    <li> Just what I asked for...</li>
    <li> It does.  I mean, my pits still stain my undershirts over time but I&#x27;ve found that Speed Stick Stainguard delays the stains longest.</li>
    <li> This stick is great. Has a light but clean smell. Does a decent job of preventing shirt yellowing. And its made in America!!</li>
    <li> This might not leave white stains, but it sure leaves oil like stains on the clothes&lt;br /&gt;and it doesn&#x27;t work as well as normal speed stick.</li>
    <li> Avoid this stuff, I only used it for about 2 weeks and within that short time it ruined 3 shirts with black stains in the armpits.</li>
