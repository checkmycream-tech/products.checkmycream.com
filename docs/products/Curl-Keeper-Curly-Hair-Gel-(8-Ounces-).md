      <li>and i love the smell.</li>
      <li>Love it and keep reordering.</li>
      <li>Love this hair gel.</li>
      <li>actually thought I was purchasing &#x27;Curl Keeper&#x27;, which is actually GREAT!!  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t sticky at all but does exactly what it is suppose to!!!  </li>
      <li>Quite honestly, with all of the advertising, I expected quite a bit more from this gel.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>It is well worth the price if you have frizzy curly hair.</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; is pretty runny</li>
      <li>My hair is less frizzy and it holds my shape nicely.</li>
      <li>doesnt do much for my 2c 3a hair</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok as a gel but even though I used the other curl products from this line, the gel made my hair straighter.</li>
      <li>I have thin curly hair and this product is amazing!</li>
      <li>It has a little more hold than my other favorite, but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair crunchy.</li>
      <li>Next day, next several days, no need to add any more product, just spray with water and do some gently scrunching.  </li>
      <li>It is the new formula</li>
      <li>this is one of the only products that really straightens my hair.</li>
      <li>Leaves the hair soft and shiny.  </li>
      <li>I am stuck with a huge bottle and am not sure what to do I with it.</li>
      <li>(I have blonde hair, which tends to live a little dehydrated).&lt;br /&gt;So in all fairness, I probably would have given this Curly Hair Solutions product a 5 if I hadn&#x27;t tried the Curl Keeper product first..........</li>

<li> I co-shampoo, and then use generous amounts of both gel formulas, and then just don&#x27;t touch it for as long as possible.  </li>
<li> It eliminates any frizz, as long as you don&#x27;t fuss with it too much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Neither works any better than the less expensive gel that I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
<li> They help tame her very curly hair without weighing it down with lots of product.  </li>
<li> It defines my extremely frizzy hair without cunchiness and I can use this daily for touch ups.</li>
<li> I also use a diffuser to blow dry along with this.</li>
<li> It also leaves my hair feeling dry and squeaky.</li>
<li> This and Curl Keeper keeps my dry hair from frizzing.</li>
<li> Rather than use something that just makes my hair sticky and dry looking, I have been using other products.</li>
<li> it didn&#x27;t perform as expected, I ordered the Curl Keeper to use with it.</li>
<li> A little (size of a quarter) goes a long way for me.</li>
<li> I do like how it controls and define my 3A/3B curl, I just have to mix it with other products.</li>
<li> It does not make it feel sticky or weighted down.</li>
<li> I rub a small about in my hands and scrunch through my dry hair.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little to heavy for my liking if I use it when my hair is wet.</li>
<li> and i got it here in amazon for half the prize!</li>
<li> average, but not too thick or sticky.</li>
<li> I have mixed curl patterns (3A-3C), Unfortunately it does nothing to tame my 3C curls.</li>
<li> and unfortunately I did not have the same results.</li>
<li> I have thin wavy/curls</li>

    <li> I have mixed curl patterns (3A-3C), Unfortunately it does nothing to tame my 3C curls. It also leaves my hair feeling dry and squeaky. I do like how it controls and define my 3A/3B curl, I just have to mix it with other products.</li>
    <li> Great gel for wavy hair. It has a little more hold than my other favorite, but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair crunchy.</li>
    <li> My salt and pepper and curly hair has never, ever looked better since I started using these Curly Hair Solution products!  Amazing results!  I co-shampoo, and then use generous amounts of both gel formulas, and then just don&#x27;t touch it for as long as possible.  Next day, next several days, no need to add any more product, just spray with water and do some gently scrunching.  I get compliments on my hair all the time!</li>
    <li> I ordered after receiving a sample in my Birchbox and the product I received was different. It is the new formula and unfortunately I did not have the same results. Rather than use something that just makes my hair sticky and dry looking, I have been using other products. I feel like this made my hair straighter. I am stuck with a huge bottle and am not sure what to do I with it. The &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; is pretty runny so you definitely should expect that going into this.</li>
    <li> this is one of the only products that really straightens my hair. i have waves in my hair, so i can either go curly or flatten it and this stuff works!  and i love the smell. i got it from birchbox and I ordered here because birchbox wanted  $19.99 for it and i got it here in amazon for half the prize!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it!!!  It isn&#x27;t sticky at all but does exactly what it is suppose to!!!  Will definately order more!!!!  Great product!!!  ❤️</li>
    <li> This is wonderful for my grandbabies super curly hair</li>
    <li> Love this hair gel. This and Curl Keeper keeps my dry hair from frizzing. Love it and keep reordering.</li>
    <li> Quite honestly, with all of the advertising, I expected quite a bit more from this gel.&lt;br /&gt;When it didn&#x27;t perform as expected, I ordered the Curl Keeper to use with it. I thought maybe&lt;br /&gt;they had to work together. Neither works any better than the less expensive gel that I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this product. It defines my extremely frizzy hair without cunchiness and I can use this daily for touch ups.</li>
    <li> I have thin curly hair and this product is amazing! My hair is less frizzy and it holds my shape nicely. A little (size of a quarter) goes a long way for me. I also use a diffuser to blow dry along with this. It does not make it feel sticky or weighted down. Over all very pleased. I use it while my hair is damp after towel drying. FYI I also use a Living Proof leave in conditioner before adding this product.</li>
    <li> average, but not too thick or sticky. doesnt do much for my 2c 3a hair</li>
    <li> Great product!  Leaves the hair soft and shiny.  Great shipping time and packaged perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have thin wavy/curls and this is perfect! Only stuff I have used for the last 3 years</li>
    <li> My wife has been using the curl keeper products for some time, and she loves them.  They help tame her very curly hair without weighing it down with lots of product.  It is well worth the price if you have frizzy curly hair.</li>
    <li> I like this gel as a finishing touch on my curly hair.  I rub a small about in my hands and scrunch through my dry hair. It&#x27;s a little to heavy for my liking if I use it when my hair is wet.</li>
    <li> Excellent product if you have curly hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok as a gel but even though I used the other curl products from this line, the gel made my hair straighter.</li>
    <li> Curly Hair Solutions works well for my medium length curly hair.  It eliminates any frizz, as long as you don&#x27;t fuss with it too much.&lt;br /&gt;I actually thought I was purchasing &#x27;Curl Keeper&#x27;, which is actually GREAT!!  It had held my curl with no frizz, no &#x27;pull&#x27; for two days, without drying out my ends (I have blonde hair, which tends to live a little dehydrated).&lt;br /&gt;So in all fairness, I probably would have given this Curly Hair Solutions product a 5 if I hadn&#x27;t tried the Curl Keeper product first.......... BUT, Curl Keeper is $5 - $6 more expensive.</li>
