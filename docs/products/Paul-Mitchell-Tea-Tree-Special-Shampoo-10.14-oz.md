<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the best shampoo ever!</li>
    <li> Super minty!  When I shampoo my head tingles then when I rinse it my back tingles, too!!!  It gets absorbed by your skin pretty easily...</li>
    <li> Actually this shampoo has done nothing good for me.  The reason I give it four stars is because I know that Paul Mitchell&#x27;s products are excellent.  This shampoo I am sure will be good for many other people.  So far it has been the best after trying Matrix, Head and&lt;br /&gt;Shoulders, its a 10, Awapuhi, Nioxin, prescribed Nizoral, Selsun Blue, TGel, Infussion, oil treatments and more.</li>
    <li> Love this product does real well getting the build up in my hair from using well water and I personally like the smell too.</li>
    <li> Nice to find it online since it&#x27;s a hassle to only get it at hair salon and beauty supply stores. Has a very distinct mint smell and makes your scalp tingle while you&#x27;re using it.  Leaves hair feeling clean. We&#x27;ve tried Trader Joe&#x27;s version of this shampoo, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as good.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo before, and love it.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo that I have used for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now.  If cleans my hair well, I like the smell and the tingle.  You don&#x27;t need much of it either.  I was a little put off by how small of a bottle it is.</li>
    <li> This is working great and smells good too!</li>
    <li> A very invigorating shampoo.  I use this shampoo about once every 2 weeks to stimulate my scalp and  make it feel really fresh and&lt;br /&gt;clean.</li>
    <li> really gets your hair squeaky clean</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo (definitely a 5 star) but was disappointed in the size.  My fault - I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the ounces.  After all was said and done, I paid as much for this one as I did the large bottle when I was in Tennessee.</li>
    <li> Product arrived with letters and other areas of the bottle scratched/etched out.. Indicating that this bottle is either old or abused. On top of that I was hoping the bottle would at least be sealed at the top like most other products are. It&#x27;s not, and there was a piece of hair/frizz on it when I took off the cap. It states clearly on the back that if this isn&#x27;t sold by a hairdresser that it may be counterfeit, black market, old or tampered with. Maybe I should have listened to that..and seems like a sign to me now that I think about it. I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s the real thing. I haven&#x27;t tried using it yet, this just upset me enough to have to write about it immediately. I&#x27;m going to use it later on today. If it is good, and makes up for how it arrived, I will update with a positive review. You can&#x27;t always judge a book by it&#x27;s cover, or a shampoo by it&#x27;s etched out bottle.</li>
    <li> I like the product, although the top of the bottle was broken open and lost some of the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to find this at a competitive price!  Very speedy shipping!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey for shampoo, but it smells incredible, feels great during shampooing.  Additionally, it gives you a cool feeling on your scalp when you step out of the shower. Worth every penny, it&#x27;s quite a luxury.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Pretty expensive for a bottle of shampoo, but it&#x27;s worth it for that Andes Mint smell in your hair.</li>
    <li> i really love the feeling when using this shampoo...that tingling feeling is always there.</li>
    <li> Smells and feels amazing! Feels refreshing every time!</li>
    <li> Great hair product! Really cleans and smells great!</li>
    <li> Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo seems to wash  my hair better than the shampoos I have been using.  The ingrediants seem to make it cleaner, and it doesn&#x27;t get as   dirty as soon.</li>
    <li> I have seriously been struggling with oily, itchy, scabby, and flaky scalp that seems like forever... It was something I was so embarrassed of and I felt disgusting all the time. Most days I didn&#x27;t want to even do my hair and have mostly been wearing it in a pony tail to hide any possible flakes. I tried every possible shampoo/conditioner, home remities and even switched to try using all organic stuff. Nothing helped... I was beginning to think I would just have to deal with it. One other complaint I had about my hair also is that it always felt heavy and weighted down and sometimes even like it felt dirty still even after washing. I bought this on a whim at my local Fred Meyers (about $16 a bottle for the medium size). And I&#x27;m so glad I did!! This has solved every issue I have with my hair! It feels alive again and super shiny and healthy looking. I loved the tingly feeling it gave my scalp and even leave it on for a minute or two to really give it a good deep cleaning. I don&#x27;t know how to explain how good it feels. It&#x27;s like my scalp is finally fresh, clean and renewed. Even the scabs are healing (gross I know. They were there due to me itching in my sleep). I researched what tea tree oil does exactly  and I wish I would have a long time ago. It is an anti bacterial and antifungal, which usually are the two main reasons for dandruff. It also calms irritated areas and helps speed healing. All around this stuff if great for dandruff and/or psoriasis.&lt;br /&gt;Get this stuff!! You won&#x27;t regret it! Worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps. In case anyone is wondering I have very thick, long, curly/wavy hair</li>
    <li> This may work. I&#x27;ll never know ,however. Managed to get a tiny bit in my eye as I was washing my hair and the burning was incredible. I realize that the directions cautioned against that. But somehow it did. It&#x27;s a very strong odor and I didn&#x27;t care for that. Just my opinion,others may love it.</li>
    <li> REALLY NICE TINGLE AND SMELL LOVE THIS BRAND</li>
    <li> This has become one of my favorite shampoos.  It smells great, has a nice tingling effect (well, I like it...), and gets my hair squeaky clean.  I don&#x27;t have dandruff but do have a bit of an itchy scalp (everything itches at 5% humidity here in the desert), which it has handled very nicely without smelling like the &amp;#34;mainstream&amp;#34; dandruff products.  It lathers well because it contains sodium lauryl sulfate.  Some people don&#x27;t like that surfactant but I am fine with it.  You don&#x27;t need to use much at all.  It works fine on its own but the conditioner that goes with it is excellent.  It makes it easy to comb my shoulder-length hair, also smells great and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  It also makes a pretty decent shampoo in its own right, which I discovered when I mixed the bottles up the first time I used the products.  I did not investigate whether the shampoo made an equally effective conditioner.  My hair is color-treated, fine but thick with a moderate curl.  Obviously I don&#x27;t know if it would work as well on other hair textures but I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly I have to downgrade my rating on this product.  It leaves my scalp feeling very itchy - itchier than before I started using this product to help make my scalp less itchy (I don&#x27;t have dandruff, just an itchy head).  I think it might be a rare reaction to one or more of the ingredients. I wear bangs and my eyes became itchy too.  I love the smell and everything else about this product and still recommend it for others, but you might want to try the shampoo alone first to make sure you like it to save the cost of the conditioner just in case.  I thought I had found the right product with natural ingredients but it just won&#x27;t work for me.  The search goes on.</li>
    <li> dries up my hair. Also it came in a bunch of mini travel or hotel shampoo bottles...</li>
    <li> Pros: Love the smell (can be a little overpowering) and the tingling sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I have Asian-like coarse hair and this shampoo sucks almost all the moisture out, leaving my hair feeling dry and tangled (even after applying the corresponding conditioner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this for myself again, although my husband, who has naturally oily hair, loves it.</li>
    <li> Hoped it would clear oily smell my hubby has... better tahn weak shampoos BUT I will never buy again... it is stew of bad toxic parabens..&lt;br /&gt;Also: Tea Tree can disrupt hormones</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo...purchased this one for my gdaughters, ages 10 &amp; 12</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used. I felt very refreshing after use.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this shampoo! I started using it a few days ago because my boyfriend&#x27;s brother uses it..... (plus I ran out of my shampoo)... and OMG!! My hair felt great! I love the tingle and the best thing it did for me was keeping my hair from getting greasy! My hair gets very quickly, but because of this shampoo, it has kept my hair perfect! Now I just wish it was cheaper</li>
    <li> great shipping love this stuff</li>
    <li> Got this shampoo for my boyfriend.  He has the worst dandruff!  With this product there&#x27;s finally less flakes.</li>
    <li> smells good, feels tingly, but it doesn&#x27;t really help with my itchiness though.</li>
    <li> My hair thanks, this shampoo is very refreshing!!!</li>
    <li> OK, But started buying generic at Sally&#x27;s Beauty</li>
    <li> I have a dandruff problem and have used many different shampoos trying to control it. Head and Shoulders, Selsun Blue both but nothing has helped like Tea Tree has. It only takes a little, an amount about the size of a dime in your hand and then work it in your hair. Of course my hair is short so it might take more for longer hair. but since I started using Tea Tree I have not had any trouble with dandruff.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It makes your scalp tingle and feel cleansed and refreshed. My hair stylist recommended that I use this because of some scalp issues and it&#x27;s really helped.</li>
    <li> This shampoo came to me back when I had hair from my hair stylist.  It has a nice tingle to it and tends to make my head feel cool for a long while afterward.</li>
    <li> Amazon is my go-to for almost everything, but I hate whe brick-and-mortar CVS of all places has a product for cheaper.  They have so much more overhead.  Makes me think that Amazon factors in the shipping into the prime price.  Anyway, product is great, makes your head feel tingly and is the only shampoo out there that works on my dandruff or itchy scalp.  I don&#x27;t use it everyday though because it leaves my hair feeling depleted.  Best for scalp treatment.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a sort of preventative during lice season in my classroom.  I love the smell and the way it tingles when you put it on, but other than that it&#x27;s just shampoo.  I didn&#x27;t get lice, so maybe it did it&#x27;s job!</li>
    <li> Does not work for me.</li>
    <li> gives my hair some revitalization and curbs itching from too much shampoo otherwise.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s the most concentrated tea tree oil shampoo I&#x27;ve ever found. It&#x27;s also the purest. Love how it leaves my scalp so clean, and super cool and tingly. I also use it as a body wash! It leaves me feeling very clean. Yes, it ain&#x27;t cheap. But the quality is bar none and I haven&#x27;t found another with such a high concentration of tea tree oil. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t take much, about a quarter size dab for your hair. Any more is wasting it. If you&#x27;ve never used it before, get ready for the ultimate tea tree experience!!!</li>
    <li> If you want to feel fresh and energized then this is the shampoo for you.  This is one of the best tea tree shampoo that I have used.  If you have ever purchased the MVP treatment at Sport Clips this is what they use.</li>
    <li> Product was spilled when opened. Cap had come off. Because we sail, I only pick up packages every few months at friend&#x27;s. It was too late to return.</li>
    <li> Great for dandruff and smells wonderful. Very calming too.</li>
    <li> I was told this product would help with dry scalp.  It has not done anything to help that, and my blond hair looks very dark and greasy after using this.  What I did love was the pleasant tingling sensation.  If I mix it with a hard-water shampoo I get the best of both worlds; just still no help with dry scalp.  Guess I&#x27;ll need 3 shampoos.</li>
    <li> I have used the Tea Tree shampoo for years. It is great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never found a shampoo that makes my hair feel this soft and clean and healthy, or look so shiny it&#x27;s like glass until this shampoo. It also smells fantastic (kinda like Sea Breeze astringent) and makes your scalp tingle. Without a doubt, the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used in my life.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected from &amp;#34;Paul Mitchell&amp;#34; and definitely not worth the price.  Left my hair greasy and dirty looking. Will stick to the cheaper stuff...</li>
    <li> It kills the fleas on my dog and she smells great...</li>
    <li> Quick shipping.  Smells great and leaves your skin tingling.  Hair feels very soft.</li>
    <li> it has helped my husbands psoriasis tremendously! it smells awesome and doesnt stink like other tea tree treatments, and his hair looks healthy.</li>
    <li> Feels tingly, but didn&#x27;t really improve my seborrheic dermatitis condition.</li>
    <li> I bought it for a child with eczema on the scalp and it has helped a lot--the scalp is no longer itchy. I started using it myself and noticed my hair looks fuller and shinier. I love this shampoo!</li>
    <li> Bottle arrived with a broken lid but was not leaking. The shampoo itself is ok, but other, cheaper shampoo can give the same results. Love the smell though.</li>
    <li> I had a surgery on my scalp 10 years ago and it flairs up every now and then. This really super awesome girl suggested I use this because she is smart and knew about skin conditions.  Anyway she bought me a bottle and it tingled and it worked well! I have been using it ever since, it has a nice smell and I don&#x27;t have the problems that I did before. I know it seems on the high side as far as price but there is a difference and I can&#x27;t see going back to regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> Best smelling shampoo I&#x27;ve ever smelled in my life.</li>
    <li> Pros: makes your hair and scalp feel very clean&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Burns your scalp and forehead a bit and has a minty smell.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo to wake you up in the morning.  Did a good job on hair as well.</li>
    <li> This shampoo really does a fantastic job and really makes the scalp feel clean! I tried it for the first time at a local salon and was sold ever since! Love using this product!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of Tea Tree Oil? This is the shampoo. I like the way it cleans my hair and I love the smell. It was a smaller bottle (about half the size) of the one I bought before, but that was a long time ago and the bottle lasted a really long time (I wash my hair every other day.) I hope that this bottle also lasts a long time. I find that a little of this shampoo goes a long way in cleaning your hair.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, wishing it were cheaper.</li>
    <li> nice smell and tingles the scalp</li>
    <li> Helps with Psoriasis.  I had used T Gel shampoo and although it was effective I couldn&#x27;t get over the smell in my hair of a refinished parking lot. Tea Tree Oil works just as well for me and the smell although somewhat strong is much better.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo. I have issues w/ flaking and it helps keep things under control. It does smell like tea tree oil so be warned.</li>
    <li> exactly what we expected.</li>
    <li> Great product! First bought it here, then found way cheaper at my local hairdresser for $12.</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo and very stimulating</li>
    <li> I really like the wy this shampoo smells. Even though I have little hair, I enjoy the smell and feel of this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! It makes my hair feel super clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got bad skin (really oily) and thick, wavy hair, and that&#x27;s led to my scalp not breathing for most of my life. This product cleans gunk out like no other. Sure, it&#x27;s got sulfates, but when paired with a moisturizing conditioner, it does a great job of stripping my scalp of all dirty feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not use on its own, as any shampoo with sulfates will likely exacerbate dry scalp - no natural moisture leads to overproduction by sebaceous glands to compensate.</li>
    <li> I prefer the Giovanni. I was surprised to discover that the Paul Mitchell relies on sodium laureth sulfate.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo ever. I have thick hair get a oily scalp sometimes itchy and this is soothing and cooling I wish I could give it 10 stars!</li>
    <li> I developed dandruff when I was using it.  It has an unusual smell like a factory grease.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed using this.</li>
    <li> Used it for years recommended by a pro</li>
    <li> So far i love this shampoo. My scalp feels nice when its on in the shower and the smells don&#x27;t stick in my hair after i dry!! I also feels like my dry scalp has gotten a bit better since using it!</li>
    <li> The best there is for cleaning my head. Anything else just leaves my scalp feeling gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But buy the gallon size and refill a smaller bottle. The per ounce price is about 1/4 of the 10oz bottle.</li>
    <li> My son has severely dry scalp in the middle of his head. This has help quite a bit. He loves the tingling sensation and the smell. Great product!</li>
    <li> so far so good ,very nice sent.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and effect!  Great shampoo.  Love the other Tea Tree products too!</li>
    <li> Smells so good! Leaves your hair feeling clean</li>
    <li> Have used it for several years, but I paid more at retail.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! Tingly but doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes :)</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use daily if you have oily hair and skin like me. It is very refreshing, especially in the south Florida heat.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have scalp problems-breakouts, etc. that I have not been able to clear.  I was hoping that this shampoo would be my miracle worker but it wasn&#x27;t..  That&#x27;s not why I gave it two stars. though.  The smell is just overwhelming.  I felt like I smelled like Vapo-Rub after using it.  My hair also did not feel clean.  I liked the tingly feeling that it gave me but that was about it.  Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> smells great, but it stings when it gets in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know if it really helps with hairfall though.&lt;br /&gt;Hasven&#x27;t really noticed a significant difference it made.</li>
    <li> I love how it tingles!</li>
    <li> Very good.  This was recommended by our hairdresser.</li>
    <li> This works great for oily hair.  The only kind of shampoo I will buy.</li>
    <li> Like the smell, and it leaves your hair dry and clean for days</li>
    <li> Help with flacks skin</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo. Great price. Love the tingly feeling on my scalp. I have a dry scalp and this helps me.</li>
    <li> If you have a dry scalp like me, I would not recommend this. But it does smell good and has extraordinary cleaning power, you only need a tiny bit of this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for years and love it and always pay in the mid $20&#x27;s so I just ordered this not realizing it was 10oz until I opened the box and seen how small it was. Product is 5 stars but not for this size/price.</li>
    <li> I loved the smell of this shampoo, it&#x27;s very refreshing first thing in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;It left my hair feeling light and full of shine, I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Not 100% sure this is 100% pure Paul Mitchell.  Gets a nice tingle but kind of just misses the mark on the WOW factor that I get from salon bought tea tree shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great produce. Price could be cheaper though. After I purchased this I found same produce at beauty supply store for $6 cheaper.  But otherwise, very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Best Shampoo ever.  Use it on your face to get a tingling feeling!  Beware of your eyes though!</li>
    <li> My two boys use this shampoo. They love the tingling feel and it washes out any reside they may leave as they rush through their morning shower,  A hair stylist suggested it because my youngest son had shampoo build up on his scalp and my oldest son had dandruff.  All gone on both fronts. Great product. Even overnight guests comment on it when they use it.</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES this shampoo.  Says it makes his scalp feel tingly clean.  :)</li>
    <li> Hubby loves the shampoo really left hair clean and a really great price and the shopping was very reasonable thanks for the quick shipping</li>
    <li> First, I have to agree with another reviewer. I got this same bottle for $15 at my CVS, so keep that in mind. Much cheaper than here especially if you have a coupon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this on the advice of a friend, who is a hair dresser, for my teenager who has oily hair. I noticed a huge difference when he came down today in the way his hair looked. Not oily; just healthy with only one use of this shampoo! I like the smell of it and he doesn&#x27;t seem to mind it either. I have not bought the conditioner as he doesn&#x27;t use it so I can&#x27;t speak about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give it 5 stars, but it&#x27;s just so expensive...I can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> It is like biofreeze for your head.  Great shampoo for football players so they don&#x27;t get &amp;#34;craddle cap&amp;#34; from their helmets.</li>
    <li> Trying to find more shampoo and conditioner for my husband very happy with the product and the price of it</li>
    <li> If you suffer from a dry scalp and dandruff, then look no further! This stuff is invigorating and cured my dandruff in less than a week. Lathers extremely well and leaves hair and head feeling soft, smooth and cool. I&#x27;ve used over 15 different shampoos to no avail. My hair stylist Recomended this product so I bought it the next day. It was $10 cheaper here than her own salon. Very pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> great for itchy scalp. works great without drying scalp, smells wonderful and you can use every day. lather is very good and easy to rinse out. bottle size perfect. highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This shampoo really helps the itch of dermatitis and seems to calm it.</li>
    <li> Bought this because I heard it helped with scalp itchiness and flakes, but it actually made it worse. Extremely upset.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo, it leaves a great feeling of freshness in the scalp. Although I still will have to wash my hair daily, it won&#x27;t look greasy or smell bad at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband, who travels a lot, has super sensitve skin, and loves this shampoo.  This is the perfect size for a regular traveler.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is pricey, but seems all of Paul Mitchell&#x27;s products are on the expensive side.  But this Tea Tree shampoo is awesome.  I like the smell and love the tingly feeling.  I find I don&#x27;t need to use it all the time, mostly a few times a week which helps with my itchy/dry scalp, especially in the winter.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings on this shampoo. I like the minty smell (although it can be a little overpowering) and tingling feeling. It definitely washes my hair well, BUT it is very drying. I feel I have to use a lot more conditioner with this product to put some moisture back into my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product and the small size makes it fit in my bathroom easier then the large size.. My husband even loves it..</li>
    <li> great product, smells AMAZING, good for use a couple times a week, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it every day because it could dry out your hair, pair with a moisturizing conditioner</li>
    <li> If you have scalp psoriasis, this will help eliminate it</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo for daily scalp treatments for my psoriasis, and I have found a great improvement in flaking and itchiness. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> make sure you don&#x27;t get NEAR your eyes....oh wait that&#x27;s not possible because it&#x27;s shampoo. This stuff stings/burns.</li>
    <li> First- GREAT SHAMPOO! My daughter has scalp issues with flaking and itching. This cleared up the problem much better than anything we ever used. But...VERY small bottle for the money!</li>
    <li> Exactly what you think it is: a bottle of Paul Mitchell shampoo, and at a much better price than you will get from the local salon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for something like10 years or more.  I use it mainly for striping out build up from other shampoos.  It&#x27;s a good product!</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t had the desired effect. Wanted to get rid of the flakes on my scalp.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo for the scalp as well as hair. My eye doctor recommended it once a week for keeping my eyelids clear of  harmful dander and dirt.</li>
    <li> Really like this shampoo!  Love the invigorating peppermint and tea tree aroma!  Energizes my scalp!&lt;br /&gt;Great service too!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo.  I  highly recommend for someone who has dry scalp issue.</li>
    <li> my hair is very full with oil, this product always give very dry and comfortable feeling,if your hair like mine, just use this one, and this place just give me nice price with good quality !! Jason Wu @ NY, 28/APR/2013</li>
