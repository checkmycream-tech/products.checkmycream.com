### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very happy with purchase - can&#x27;t find these in stores!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful and sturdy clip!  </li>
      <li>YOU&#x27;LL BE HAPPY WITH THIS!!!</li>
      <li>The best clip I have ever had</li>
      <li>Gorgeous Hair Clip!</li>
      <li>This hair clip is beautiful and well-made.</li>
      <li>Beautiful clip.</li>
      <li>Very nice hair clip, holds up well</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>It is strong and attractive.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d be on the borderline about recommending it to a friend though unless they really, really liked the way it looked.</li>
      <li>Not this one, it holds my hair securely without pulling on my skin and looks good with most of my wardrobe.  </li>
      <li>Elegant design&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Looks well made and stylish.  </li>
      <li>Still, a stunning stylish piece.</li>
      <li>For years I have been searching for the quaility type of hair accessories that I used to be able to find in better stores.</li>
      <li>Love it, so glad I found it.  </li>
      <li>and I love the color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>A nice clip with the the right amount of hold.  </li>
      <li>This is the type of quality that was easy to find twenty years ago but it is not so now.</li>
      <li>This can just as easily be used for an evening out.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t look &#x27;cheap&#x27;, garish, or tacky.</li>
      <li>These beautiful, high quality adornments are made in France and the difference is apparent!</li>
      <li>The quality of the clip isn&#x27;t as great as I expected.</li>
      <li>It is classy, it holds my fine hair very securely, and it does not pull.  </li>
      <li>right and well.</li>
      <li>All of the Karina clips I have are excellent, you can&#x27;t go wrong with them.</li>
      <li>this claw clip is pretty hardy.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Is it pretty-</li>
      <li>Is it a higher quality than my drug store clips?</li>
      <li>This Red Sophistication Claw Clip is really quite lovely in person.</li>
      <li>It has a dainty enamel design and deep red hue that can be worn by any female at any age level.</li>
      <li>Holds hair very well.</li>
      <li>Design as shown, nor really floral as stated.</li>
      <li>The hold itself is pretty standard, but if I place the claws on my bun just right, then it stays on for a while&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>The picture made it look like it&#x27;s glazed over with some heavy-duty clear plastic, and honestly for the price, I did expect it to be a little bit heavier than it is.</li>
      <li>As some reviews have already stated, there isn&#x27;t much of a difference between this clip and a clip you&#x27;d buy at a Walmart or any other drug store, BUT I say that this hair clip&#x27;s quality is a bit better than say, a $5 set of big claw clips.</li>
      <li>The size is perfect for my thick, Asian hair that goes down almost to my waist</li>
      <li>Looks just as good as the picture, but quite small and due to the angle doesn&#x27;t hold that much hair.</li>
      <li>I love this red and black clip.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this clip for over two weeks, and so far, it does the job</li>
      <li>Not bad and a little big clip</li>
      <li>It will hold well for long thick hair for sure.</li>
      <li>love the red and black -- hard to find.  </li>

    <li> Beautiful clip. Holds hair very well. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Looks well made and stylish.  Larger and showier than you might expect.  Design as shown, nor really floral as stated.</li>
    <li> The best clip I have ever had</li>
    <li> PROS: 1. The size is perfect for my thick, Asian hair that goes down almost to my waist (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3)&lt;br /&gt;2. Absolutely no headaches from the hold&lt;br /&gt;3. Elegant design&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: 1. The hold itself is pretty standard, but if I place the claws on my bun just right, then it stays on for a while&lt;br /&gt;2. The quality of the clip isn&#x27;t as great as I expected. The picture made it look like it&#x27;s glazed over with some heavy-duty clear plastic, and honestly for the price, I did expect it to be a little bit heavier than it is. I&#x27;ll just take it as the shipping costing me $6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: YES, it works! I&#x27;ve had this clip for over two weeks, and so far, it does the job right and well. As some reviews have already stated, there isn&#x27;t much of a difference between this clip and a clip you&#x27;d buy at a Walmart or any other drug store, BUT I say that this hair clip&#x27;s quality is a bit better than say, a $5 set of big claw clips. I&#x27;d be on the borderline about recommending it to a friend though unless they really, really liked the way it looked. CHEERS!</li>
    <li> I have weird hair; it&#x27;s both thin and thick, dry and oily and tends to break claw clips or let them slide out while I&#x27;m walking and they get lost.  Not this one, it holds my hair securely without pulling on my skin and looks good with most of my wardrobe.  It doesn&#x27;t look &#x27;cheap&#x27;, garish, or tacky.</li>
    <li> love the red and black -- hard to find.  I have several!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful and sturdy clip!  Thank you for the speedy service!</li>
    <li> It is sturdy and made out of quality material (plastic?) but it is too heavy for my type of hair which is smooth/straight.  It will hold well for long thick hair for sure.</li>
    <li> RECOMMEND THIS RED &amp; BLACK HAIR CLIP TO ALL WOMEN!!! IT GRIPS HAIR TIGHTLY AND I&#x27;VE RECEIVED COMPLIMENTS!!! BUY IT YOU&#x27;LL BE HAPPY WITH THIS!!!</li>
    <li> A nice clip with the the right amount of hold.  All of the Karina clips I have are excellent, you can&#x27;t go wrong with them.</li>
    <li> I use this every day.  It is strong and attractive.</li>
    <li> What a waist of money! This clip fall apart in two weeks!</li>
    <li> For the price, I&#x27;m not impressed. Is it pretty- yes, does it work- yes. Is it a higher quality than my drug store clips? No. I just purchased a set of 8 octopus clips, about this size, in tortoise shell, for less than 3 dollars at my local walgreens. They were on clearance, but things often are.&lt;br /&gt;I feel stupid for having bought one 11 dollar plastic hair clip.</li>
    <li> Not bad and a little big clip</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy, does the job.  Doesn&#x27;t pinch or pull hair as some claw clips do sometimes.  Can&#x27;t speak of the durability, seems like it is a little on the fragile side.</li>
    <li> Looks just as good as the picture, but quite small and due to the angle doesn&#x27;t hold that much hair. Still, a stunning stylish piece. I wish they made it in bigger size.</li>
    <li> I love this red and black clip.  It is classy, it holds my fine hair very securely, and it does not pull.  I wear it regularly.</li>
    <li> For years I have been searching for the quaility type of hair accessories that I used to be able to find in better stores. Finally, I hit the bonanza on Amazon! These beautiful, high quality adornments are made in France and the difference is apparent! This is the type of quality that was easy to find twenty years ago but it is not so now. I am ordering a second one of this beauty because I couldn&#x27;t bear it if I lost it or it broke. Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> Very nice hair clip, holds up well and I love the color.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend</li>
    <li> Gorgeous Hair Clip! This hair clip is beautiful and well-made. I bought it to sweep my hair up in the morning when I wash my face. I hate the ugly, cheap hair clips made by some other manufacturers (G) or (S)...This can just as easily be used for an evening out. I love it!</li>
    <li> This Red Sophistication Claw Clip is really quite lovely in person. It has a dainty enamel design and deep red hue that can be worn by any female at any age level. I happen to have medium length thick hair and this claw clip is pretty hardy. I know that it can hold my hair in place for as long as I want it up. I would recommend this claw clip to everybody.</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase - can&#x27;t find these in stores!</li>
    <li> Too round and to garb hair</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair &amp; it&#x27;s difficult to find clips to hold it all together.  My hair is worn up so you can imagine how keeping thick hair in place without having to re-do it during the day could be but this clip does the job!  Love it, so glad I found it.  Thanks!</li>
