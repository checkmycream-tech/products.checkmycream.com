      <li>It works great.     </li>
      <li>These are so amazing!</li>
      <li>I received my order in good time and condition.    </li>
      <li>I was very glad to find it again.  </li>

      <li>The loop was thinner and after a couple of uses it broke at the top of the loop!</li>
      <li>This item was very popular and easy to find a couple of years ago.</li>
      <li>Amazed at speed of delivery...surpassed their own time estimate.  </li>
      <li>Still, this is very cheaply made.</li>
      <li>This tool makes it easy and nice looking.  </li>
      <li>I have had one of these for years, gave it to a friend in India and was  so pleased to find a source again.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m buying three more</li>
      <li>So I bought more and gave them as gifts ...</li>
      <li>The top of the loop snapped as I pulled it through my hair.</li>
      <li>Love it, love it, love it.</li>
      <li>Nothing pulls hair through rubberbands and squeegies better than this tool.  </li>
      <li>It makes styling so easy yet the result looks like it takes hours and inginuity.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too fine to be held up with clips and gets frizzy if I just let it air-dry.  </li>
      <li>I taped it and it&#x27;s working fine.</li>
      <li>I purchased two and am very happy with this little hair styling tool.</li>
      <li>so I did some research and found it available through amazon.com.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a cheap knock-off and the angle of the connection between the \\&quot;needle\\&quot; portion and the \\&quot;eye\\&quot; portion makes it not work as well.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for this everywhere and was so happy when I finally found one here on Amazon!!!  </li>
      <li>it is really cheaply made and i dont like it</li>
      <li>Bottom-of-the-barrel cheap plastic junk.</li>
      <li>I bought the original many years ago and loved it, but lost it in subsequent moves.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the money!</li>
      <li>The revisited edition doesn&#x27;t seem quite as sturdy as the original, but it does the job.</li>
      <li>I bought it and waited excitedly for it&#x27;s delivery.</li>
      <li>I have 3 girls and was so excited to find this product.  </li>
      <li>This picture looks like the original topsy-tail.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine, straight hair which is probably why it works so well on me.</li>
      <li>Though it was more costly then the first one I bought - it was well worth the money.  </li>
      <li>I was so happy to find this as the one I bought when these first showed up in the local stores</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fun device, but not well made like the original.</li>
      <li>It was shipped and received quite quickly.  </li>
      <li>The one I received is more orange in color than pink, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth the cost of returning it, but I won&#x27;t get it again.</li>
      <li>Since they were kind enough to do a refund, I raised my rating.  </li>
      <li>It is a little bit thinner but seems to be just as good as the original.</li>
      <li>so you have to work with it awhile to get it to look right.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use and comes with instructions for multiple hair designs.</li>
      <li>Broke first time in use but seller sent me two.</li>
      <li>Was exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>My last topsy tailer was way better and it eventually broke.  </li>
      <li>It has preformed exactly as described in the article that I had read.</li>
      <li>I used it the first night it arrived</li>
      <li>and it broke on the first girl.  </li>
      <li>It broke the first time I ever tried to use it.</li>
      <li>it us cheaply made not like the old ones.</li>
      <li>It makes the top of the hair flat</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m positive it will break.</li>
      <li>Because of this tool i can pull my hair back into a style that looks great for work and because it&#x27;s pulled tight my hair drys sleek instead of frizzy.  </li>
      <li>This topsy tail hair tool is very flimsy.  </li>
      <li>It is made of cheap plastic and broke the second time I used it.</li>
      <li>now the whole office uses them.</li>
      <li>I really appreciate my Topsy Tail Braid Maker.  </li>
      <li>I was very upset when my daughter broke my Topsy Turn which I&#x27;ve had for almost 20yrs, so when this arrived and it worked just as well, I could not have been happier.  </li>
      <li>I noticed it looked different from the one I originally had.</li>
      <li>THis is a nice way to do long hair, however you have to have a band that is strong but not large enough to show.</li>
      <li>I have always done the flip ponytail by hand, but have never been able to get it tight and neat looking.</li>
      <li>This is a neat little hair styling tool that I have really enjoyed.  </li>
      <li>This is a great tool in general but, unfortunately, it broke the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy to use and adds a little pizzazz to a simple hairdo.  </li>
      <li>Having long hair in a corporate environment means coming up with creative ways to put my hair up and create a professional appearance.</li>
      <li>but the new ones I received it was flexible and works no problems got results I was looking for and received compliments.</li>
      <li>I like trying new styles all the time.</li>
      <li>My hair is long and kind of thin, but I can still use it with some degree of success.</li>
      <li>just like old times, didn&#x27;t think they still sold this item.</li>
      <li>Bought this prodcut for my young daughter.  </li>
      <li>This product even makes a pony tail look classy.</li>
      <li>No complaints thus far.  </li>
      <li>I found this product to be very useful although after purchasing this from Amazon I found it elsewhere for less the half the price and was very dissappointed.</li>
      <li>However, tool came in a package that has front &amp; backside instructions in some apparent Asian language ideographs.  </li>

<li> This simple hair styling tool should be owned by anyone with hair long enough to put in a pony tail.</li>
<li> Thanks to this little piece of plastic I no longer have to dry my hair!  </li>
<li> A complete waste of money.</li>
<li> It may work better if you have VERY thin hair, but if your hair is remotely thick at all</li>
<li> If you have somewhat long, somewhat thick hair and often pull it back into a ponytail, Topsy Tail will add a note of elegance and beauty to your style.  </li>
<li> If you can spare eight dollars, and don&#x27;t mind the instructions being in a foreign language, then I say give it a try.</li>
<li> The material it is made out of is EXTREMELY flimsy.</li>
<li> I have waist length hair that I usually braid or wear back.  </li>
<li> You just have to practice to learn how tight to make the band and how loose to make the pony tail.</li>
<li> You have to be VERY careful with it.</li>
<li> This product was not worth the money.</li>
<li> My only complaint is the price.</li>
<li> BIG WASTE MONEY!!</li>
<li> and I believe the plastic  was dry out and hard</li>
<li> After several uses, mine hasn&#x27;t broken... yet.</li>
<li> Very disappointing since the original one I had I used repeatedly without incident.</li>
<li> I was so excited to try this product but ended up being very disappointed.</li>
<li> My hair isn&#x27;t too thick, and it WOULD NOT pull my ponytail through:</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have thick or curly hair</li>
<li> if you had thick hair i do believe it would break.</li>
<li> I had been trying to find one for quite a while since I had broken the one I had.</li>

    <li> They sent me the wrong item and charged me for two of them I dont even give them a one star.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for this everywhere and was so happy when I finally found one here on Amazon!!!  I may have to get some more as gifts for family and friends!  These are so amazing!</li>
    <li> I had a Topsy Tail that I purchased 5 or 6 years ago. It&#x27;s gone now, so I did some research and found it available through amazon.com. I bought it and waited excitedly for it&#x27;s delivery. The day it arrived I noticed it looked different from the one I originally had. The loop was thinner and after a couple of uses it broke at the top of the loop! Very disappointing since the original one I had I used repeatedly without incident. It&#x27;s a fun device, but not well made like the original. It wasn&#x27;t worth the cost of returning it, but I won&#x27;t get it again.</li>
    <li> I really appreciate my Topsy Tail Braid Maker.  It&#x27;s quick and easy to use and adds a little pizzazz to a simple hairdo.  I received my order in good time and condition.    Thank you,  Bonnie</li>
    <li> Bought this prodcut for my young daughter.  She loves it.  Very easy to use and comes with instructions for multiple hair designs.</li>
    <li> Thanks to this little piece of plastic I no longer have to dry my hair!  My hair has always been difficult in the mornings.  It&#x27;s too fine to be held up with clips and gets frizzy if I just let it air-dry.  Because of this tool i can pull my hair back into a style that looks great for work and because it&#x27;s pulled tight my hair drys sleek instead of frizzy.  I&#x27;m buying three more so I always have one with me!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product but ended up being very disappointed. It is made of cheap plastic and broke the second time I used it. The top of the loop snapped as I pulled it through my hair.</li>
    <li> This topsy tail hair tool is very flimsy.  I don&#x27;t have thick or curly hair and I&#x27;m positive it will break. My last topsy tailer was way better and it eventually broke.  This one don&#x27;t stand a chance.</li>
    <li> This picture looks like the original topsy-tail.  The product for sale is not.  It&#x27;s just a cheap knock-off and the angle of the connection between the \\&quot;needle\\&quot; portion and the \\&quot;eye\\&quot; portion makes it not work as well.  Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> This simple hair styling tool should be owned by anyone with hair long enough to put in a pony tail. It makes styling so easy yet the result looks like it takes hours and inginuity. This item was very popular and easy to find a couple of years ago. I had been trying to find one for quite a while since I had broken the one I had. I went to Amazon and put Topsy Tail in the search box and viola there it was. I purchased two and am very happy with this little hair styling tool.</li>
    <li> This tool is awesome.  I used to pay my daughter&#x27;s hairdresser a lot of money to style her hair using this tool.  Now I can do it myself and save the money. My only complaint is the price. I paid over 13.00 dollars for this including shipping--seems like a lot of money for a plastic thing that cost pennies to make.  Oh well, it will soon pay for itself.</li>
    <li> This product was not worth the money. It broke the first time I ever tried to use it. The material it is made out of is EXTREMELY flimsy. It may work better if you have VERY thin hair, but if your hair is remotely thick at all I would not recommend this product (although I would not recommend this product anyways). BIG WASTE MONEY!! This product is VERY VERY low quality!</li>
    <li> Though it was more costly then the first one I bought - it was well worth the money.  Can&#x27;t do a proper topsy tail without it!</li>
    <li> I had one of these in the 80&#x27;s. It disappeared somewhere along the line, and for years when I wanted a fancier look with my hair up I&#x27;d do the &#x27;flip and roll&#x27; by hand. The Topsy Tail makes it easier, neater and tighter. Having long hair in a corporate environment means coming up with creative ways to put my hair up and create a professional appearance. This product even makes a pony tail look classy.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this as the one I bought when these first showed up in the local stores years ago broke. The one I received is more orange in color than pink, but that&#x27;s okay. It works great.     I have used the larger (fabric) hair bands to add some color. You just have to practice to learn how tight to make the band and how loose to make the pony tail.</li>
    <li> it us cheaply made not like the old ones. if you had thick hair i do believe it would break. it is really cheaply made and i dont like it</li>
    <li> I do not recommend buying this because: 1) My hair isn&#x27;t too thick, and it WOULD NOT pull my ponytail through:[ 2)You can make a \\&quot; Topsy Tail\\&quot; hairstyle yourself by putting a pony in, and making a hole were the hair meets the hair-tie ( behind the hair tie )and putting the pony through! 3) The instructions are in Japanese. &lt;3</li>
    <li> I ordered this after finding a hairstyle for my daughter online that referenced it.  It was shipped and received quite quickly.  Was exactly as described.  No complaints thus far.  It has preformed exactly as described in the article that I had read.</li>
    <li> This is the best and irreplaceable tool in my hairstyling kit.  Nothing pulls hair through rubberbands and squeegies better than this tool.  When mine broke, I couldn&#x27;t rest until I found another.  Love it, love it, love it.</li>
    <li> I was very upset when my daughter broke my Topsy Turn which I&#x27;ve had for almost 20yrs, so when this arrived and it worked just as well, I could not have been happier.  It is a little bit thinner but seems to be just as good as the original.</li>
    <li> If you have somewhat long, somewhat thick hair and often pull it back into a ponytail, Topsy Tail will add a note of elegance and beauty to your style.  My hair is long and kind of thin, but I can still use it with some degree of success.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be very useful although after purchasing this from Amazon I found it elsewhere for less the half the price and was very dissappointed.</li>
    <li> I have always gotten alot of complaments on my hair when I  use the topsy tail. So I bought more and gave them as gifts ... now the whole office uses them.</li>
    <li> I have waist length hair that I usually braid or wear back.  I bought the original many years ago and loved it, but lost it in subsequent moves.  I was very glad to find it again.  The revisited edition doesn&#x27;t seem quite as sturdy as the original, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> Used it three times and it broke.  It worked great till it broke.  The quality is horrible.  DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great tool in general but, unfortunately, it broke the first time I used it. You have to be VERY careful with it. I taped it and it&#x27;s working fine. Still, this is very cheaply made.</li>
    <li> This is a neat little hair styling tool that I have really enjoyed.  I like trying new styles all the time. I remember this tool from years ago, and was happy to find it here again.</li>
    <li> I have 3 girls and was so excited to find this product.  I used it the first night it arrived and it broke on the first girl.  I am so dissappointed with the quality.</li>
    <li> Broke first time in use but seller sent me two. and I believe the plastic  was dry out and hard and that&#x27;s why it broke but the new ones I received it was flexible and works no problems got results I was looking for and received compliments. just like old times, didn&#x27;t think they still sold this item. I had it years ago.  Yes will buy again. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Within 2 days of my wife receiving this, both of them broke. Bottom-of-the-barrel cheap plastic junk. A complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I was very angry about this order but Envisonet refunded my money when they found I was not satisfied.  Since they were kind enough to do a refund, I raised my rating.  However, I cannot give 5 stars because the picture in the ad does not even come close to what I received.    I ordered Topsy Tail Style Hair Braid Tool Braidmaker which is yellow and darn sturdy. What I got was Topsy Tail and Topsy Tail Jr Style Hair Braid Tool Braidmaker which is a 2 piece set and flimsy as h**l! Instructions are in an Asian language.</li>
    <li> Amazed at speed of delivery...surpassed their own time estimate.  However, tool came in a package that has front &amp; backside instructions in some apparent Asian language ideographs.  Still trying to determine which specific language so I can hopefully use OCR scanning software to read &amp; then translate into (U.S.) English.  Sellor would be doing a service to buyers by:&lt;br /&gt;1. Stating somewhere on posted ad, that instructions are only in ___ (language name);&lt;br /&gt;2. Sending a (U.S.) English printed translation with package to buyers; or,&lt;br /&gt;3. Both 1. &amp; 2., above.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1KZ85EKOKXECU]]I proved that it works. I&#x27;ll admit it looks flimsy, but it gets the job done. After several uses, mine hasn&#x27;t broken... yet. I have very fine, straight hair which is probably why it works so well on me. If you can spare eight dollars, and don&#x27;t mind the instructions being in a foreign language, then I say give it a try.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000VJH6HU Topsy Tail Braiding Tool- Braid Maker]]    I have had one of these for years, gave it to a friend in India and was  so pleased to find a source again.</li>
    <li> THis is a nice way to do long hair, however you have to have a band that is strong but not large enough to show. It makes the top of the hair flat so you have to work with it awhile to get it to look right. I do use it and like it. I have given it as a gift.</li>
    <li> I have always done the flip ponytail by hand, but have never been able to get it tight and neat looking. This tool makes it easy and nice looking.  Well worth the money!</li>
