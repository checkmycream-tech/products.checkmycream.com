      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I have used many creams .</li>
      <li>I was impressed by the fact that the site did not claim that their products cured everything from baldness to low sex drive.  </li>
      <li>To me, that isn&#x27;t the best thing since I&#x27;d rather have something that works really well, but if you have sensitive skin, this is good for that.</li>
      <li>This is a very good cream, my skin feels softer and nicer after I use it regularly.</li>
      <li>very good product -- no irritation despite daily use.</li>
      <li>lightweight, easy to apply, nongreasy.</li>
      <li>Non-greasy, absorbs into your skin very quickly and has no noticeable odor.  </li>
      <li>I bought this product thinking it was gonna be strong.</li>
      <li>Again, I am very pleased, I feel the Watts retinol products helps even out my skin and certainly helps smooth it by lessening pore size along with helping fine lines.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have wrinkles or fine lines</li>
      <li>I got this to help with both fine wrinkles and acne/blackheads.</li>
      <li>and I do see the fine lines&lt;</li>

      <li>I did not notice any sensitivity to light after it whatsoever.</li>
      <li>Overall happy but will probably try another product as it didn&#x27;t give desired results</li>
      <li>Creamy, &amp; light.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product been using it a couple days and already this stuff has reduce my acme and is starting to tone my skin I hop my review helps and please remember to use sunscreen</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nice product, highly recommend</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  I see great skin results!</li>
    <li> This product really works.  I love it</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything. Not even a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Great product!  The cosmetic companies overprice this stuff ridiculously and this is a great price. Visible results for this concentration of retinol!</li>
    <li> ...actually does a pretty darn good job in making your skin seem very healthy again.  i&#x27;m about 4 wks into using it... and it does appear to make me look a little better.  however, the &amp;#34;jury is still out&amp;#34;.  used sparingly each day is recommended... until you find a pace where your face accepts the retinol without any over reaction(redness, etc.)  ...overall its loaded with good stuff that really can&#x27;t hurt, and, most likely will help your skin... then they threw in some retinol  ...for good measure!  and overall its pretty cool stuff !!!</li>
    <li> Working well with my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> very good..have noticed a differience..ordered again..</li>
    <li> seems to be pretty good on hands - to heavy for face.</li>
    <li> makes my skin soft and smooth</li>
    <li> very good product -- no irritation despite daily use. lightweight, easy to apply, nongreasy. i &#x27;ll definitely keep using it -- seems to have made a difference in the overall texture of facial skin.</li>
    <li> Have tried this product in the 2% strength and this 2.5% does make a difference, amazingly so, with such a little difference in the amounts of retinol.  Both products are great but this one is my favorite.  I use it nightly immediately after washing my face with a follow up of argan oil.  I have combination oily skin and neither products add to my skins oiliness.  I used to just use argan oil only but now in combination, my skin looks younger, has taken on a more dewy appearance and I&#x27;m not getting new wrinkles which is a miracle for someone almost 60 years old!</li>
    <li> Yupp I am going to get another one!! It is dreamy!! My skin looks and feels amazing!!</li>
    <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t know how to use this product, but I have used even really small amounts and my face looks worse in the morning.  It&#x27;s like it dries and crines the skin.. I&#x27;m looking for the opposit effect.  I thought this was going to be great, but have been afraid to use it.</li>
    <li> The product did absolutely nothing to age spot, milia, or acne after over three weeks of use.  I broke out more; I do not have a severe acne issue.  I get a few bumps here and there that are under the skin acne that hurt. I was hoping that it cleared up a few wrinkles on my forehead and got rid of the milia-bumps on face in a few places. I began to wonder if the positive reviews were false to sell the product.  I am very disappointed. I keep using it as if a miracle will appear.  If that happens, I will rewrite my review.</li>
    <li> The shipping was very quick! I began using the same night, following the directions and I began to feel tingling right away. I have only been using this product for about one week but can see some results already! I would suggest this product to anyone I know .</li>
    <li> Another great product.  Seeing results overnight.  Wear a sunscreen by day.</li>
    <li> i struggled with my skin issues for years. I had terrible acne growing up and now in my mid 20&#x27;s I get the annoying PMS breakouts which tend to leave dark marks on my face. It takes forever for dark spots to fade and that is the worst feeling to have, when you get rid of your acne but still have  a mark! I started using this product, paired with the oxygenated blueberry masque from babyface (amazing!) and the results are fantastic!  I totally stopped using my regular Olay moisturizer and replaced it with this. Each night after cleansing my face, I use the masque for 20 mins, exfoliate with a facial brush, and apply this cream. 2 pumps of this stuff is all i need. I swear after only a week of using it my complexion is bright and the texture of my skin is improving. It&#x27;s important to have a skin care routine and not just rely on one product to work miracles, but adding this to my regular routine seemed to give me results faster than I thought it would. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles or fine lines so I&#x27;m unsure of how fast this would work for those issues, but as far as wanting something to make your complexion brighter smoother and overall just better- this i would recommend !</li>
    <li> After two weeks I noticed a big improvement .  My skin looks more radient and is starting to have that youthful glow again. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and don&#x27;t see any. changes in lines or brown spots but I&#x27;m going to continue using it for at least six months because what I&#x27;ve read u will see full results then. I do recommend this product and will keep using.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Ut really helps with the blemishes at my ripe age, 67.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing anti- wrinkle cream that has addressed several of my anti- aging concerns. The product goes on very smoothly, and my skin feels very hydrated after each application. It is to be used as part of your evening skin care routine. It comes in a nice pump and you only need a very small amount so the product will last a long time. I did experience a small amount of flaking on the skin when I first started using it, but it quickly subsided. I have noticed my skin looks much more even toned, firmer and my wrinkles have become less noticeable.</li>
    <li> Useless product. Doesn&#x27;t work. Definitely a waste of money. There&#x27;s no way this is 2.5% retinol. Still using as a standard moisturizer only.</li>
    <li> Works!!! I will purchase again from same seller. At 72 I&#x27;m looking good. Wish they had this when I was young. I think I would look like a young adult:). In the face anyhow!</li>
    <li> my skin feels so soft,,,,after a few days of use and dry skin slothing off.  It changed the texture of my face, neck and chest.  Wonderful!!</li>
    <li> Have tried many Retinol products over the years and this is by far the best. Very creamy with less irritation despite the higher percentage. It also has a pleasant scent instead of the odor the generic Retinols have. I&#x27;ve been on the search for anti-aging products that actually DO SOMETHING for years. My laugh lines are no where near as bad as they were when I started with this cream. My forehead is not near as defined by the wrinkles. I will definitely buy again. Shipped timely</li>
    <li> I had dark spots, a forehead furrow that became longer and deeper every day, lines around my mouth, blotches, open pores and dry skin. I decided to try this one because of the great reviews. On the second day of trying this I saw that my blotchy skin looked much more brighter and softer, my fine lines however looked awful until 7 days later when the lines on my forehead were pretty much gone. I use this only at night time and I do put a night time moisturizer over it. During the day I use an SPF moisturizer. After 2 weeks my skin had so dramatically improved, I actually saw my younger blemish free skin back. Never thought that would happen. I need less make-up during the day now.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this to reduce the wrinkles on the side of my eyes because they were becoming very visible due to the time I spend on the computer. After applying this cream every morning, I&#x27;m starting to notice the wrinkles going away.</li>
    <li> Great price but I have not seen the results I&#x27;ve been looking for. Had hoped to improve clarity but have not noticed a change after 3 weeks. I&#x27;ll keep using it and see the results (or not) long term</li>
    <li> This is a great product been using it a couple days and already this stuff has reduce my acme and is starting to tone my skin I hop my review helps and please remember to use sunscreen</li>
    <li> Not sure what is in it had to trust retinol was in there not such a great feeling. Texture good and smells good</li>
    <li> I am currently on my second bottle and will order another. The lines on my forehead are noticeably diminished. My skin feels tighter and glowing. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I do  not think this  works..........it is a thick cream that will not come out of the bottle - does&#x27;nt feel like it works - every other retinol cream that I have ever used felt like it was tingly and working</li>
    <li> I love this cream. I have been using it for a few months and have gotten so many compliments on my skin when I don&#x27;t have make up on. I feel it is doing what it is suppose to be doing. Great price too.&amp;#34; &amp;#34;I have been looking for a product that contains lots of Retinol-A but doesn&#x27;t cost too much. Here it is. This has more Retinol than the previous product I have been using and feels much better. It&#x27;s creamy and doesn&#x27;t feel oily or have too much scent. I have sensitive skin and break out easily but this has not affected me badly in any way. I put this on as soon as I get out of the shower and can feel the difference on my face and neck. Less wrinkles is always a good thing! I will purchase this again</li>
    <li> I am 37 and have been using the product for three weeks I had to ease into because it did cause a little redness and irritation, but the results are amazing. This is my first time using a retinol product, my skin is reacting well to it is erasing my fine lines and wrinkles I but it on at bedtime alone and I wake up with fewer lines, smaller pores and smooth skin that I haven&#x27;t since my early twenties. I can&#x27;t believe all the other women have not had the same experience. You must thoroughly wash your face apply at night, by itself; face hands and neck. My neck is starting to look great, probably my biggest problem area. So excited to see what next week will bring, wear lots of sunblock while using this product.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product. My face looks younger..</li>
    <li> Received this product within two days.  The seller has followed up to ensure I received my order and was satisfied with the service and product.  I love this cream.  My face feels like silk.  This cream goes on very easy.  Non-greasy, absorbs into your skin very quickly and has no noticeable odor.  Love this product.  Works better than any similar products I have tried previously.  Love it.  Definitely recommend this seller and cream.</li>
    <li> I really like this!  I will reorder this item!</li>
    <li> Product is a light cream, not heavy.  Have used for about 2 weeks now, remarkable reduction in age spots and skin seems smoother.  So far, best product I have tried by far.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really felt or seen anything in the few weeks I have used it.</li>
    <li> This is hands down my favorite product! I have oily, acne prone skin and mild rosacea and my prescription was only drying my skin. I bought this and have had such amazing results! Clearer skin and decreased redness without any drying your skin!</li>
    <li> I have three weeks of using the product my wrinkles are the same no changes are observed as the salesman said cream.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. My second order.</li>
    <li> While I don&#x27;t yet have much in the way of deep wrinkles as I&#x27;m only 31, I have definitely noticed a reduction in the fine lines. Overall my skin looks much smoother and more luminous, I&#x27;ve always had a problem with uneven skin. I started using this after my mom started using it last year, she&#x27;s 66 years old, and after using it for maybe 6 months or so, her sister actually asked her if she&#x27;d had work done. I got some for myself after that. You know the old saying, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</li>
    <li> Seems to be doing what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> Just started using this about 3, 4 wks ago and I really like it. Lines seem to go away around eye area. Now I need to find an everyday retinol.</li>
    <li> I guess it ok , still trying it out.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really see any difference yet. Maybe I need to give it more time. Its okay.</li>
    <li> I love this cream! I apply 2 pumps on my freshly cleansed face every night. I&#x27;ve been using for about a month now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks so smooth and pore less! Dark spots are lighter and my skin tone is even and glowing!</li>
    <li> Two weeks, no change😞</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I had very dark spots caused by sun damage. This cream evened out my skin.  I tried many other creams before this one and none lighten the dark spots like this one.  I also had very dark circles under my eyes that made me look like a raccoon, but this cream has gotten rid of the problem.  Do not be afraid to use this product even if you have tan pigmentation.  I highly recommend this product.  I am very satisfied with the results.  I will be buying it again. Do not expect results too quickly, it took four weeks before I started seeing the improvement on my skin. It also reduces the wrinkles. Love my new look!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my breakouts and I must say this cream keeps my skin clear but as an added bonus I look a little younger and I am noticing less lines in my face.</li>
    <li> Just a great product for the price.</li>
    <li> I have been using Watts retinol creams for about a year and have been pleased with the results.  When I saw this new product, of course I had to try it.  Again, I am very pleased, I feel the Watts retinol products helps even out my skin and certainly helps smooth it by lessening pore size along with helping fine lines.  I will continue using the Watts line of products.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t a bad product. Didn&#x27;t see improvement as was stated.</li>
    <li> SUPER FAST SHIPPING, THE ITEM REALLY MAKES MY FACE FEEL SO SOFT AND SILKY! MAKES THE WRINKLES DISAPPEAR PRETTY NICELY! THANKS SO MUCH!</li>
    <li> This has not shown no significant results like other products I have used, I don&#x27;t feel I will purchase this again</li>
    <li> Overall happy but will probably try another product as it didn&#x27;t give desired results</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well it works. I have read that retinol tingleso when applied and I don&#x27;t feel anything with this but it seems like a decent moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This product absolutely needed for every women after 40 for evening use</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t notice anything more than regular mosturizer</li>
    <li> Helps keep my skin clear. Not irritating like some retinols can be.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know it is working on my skin.</li>
    <li> I was impressed by the fact that the site did not claim that their products cured everything from baldness to low sex drive.  Still, I had never dealt with them before, so I was cautious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve gotten older, the skin on my arms had gotten very thin and dry and would tear and bleed if I bumped something even rather lightly.  I decided to try this product out by applying it to only one arm and comparing results to the &amp;#34;control&amp;#34; arm.  I began to see results in a week or two, but continued the experiment for a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results were more than satisfactory.  I&#x27;m not going to have the skin of a twenty year old ever again, but I&#x27;m not bleeding and putting on bandages every time I accidentally brush up against something.  I don&#x27;t know whether this product is rebuilding or thickening the skin, but  my arms are now much more supple and flexible.  Whether it is medicine or just a really, really good moisturizer doesn&#x27;t matter to me.  It simply works amazingly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use it on both arms every night and have already reordered.  The bottle lasts a long time since only a small amount is needed.  Read the directions regarding how and when to use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A FABULOUS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> very nice i like the  way it feels on my skin my skin feels smooth since i started using it the fine lines has softened and are less visible&lt;br /&gt; good price for Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin E and Green Tea cream</li>
    <li> This has palm oil in it! This is what is killing all of the rainforest off and the orangutans are dying so people can grow palm oil trees. I am so upset that this product had it in it. I cannot seem to find any retinol cream that does not have this in it. It does seem to work with other lotion as well combined. I do use roc but I think in like this one better. I have also used a peel but between that and this product my wrinkles on my forehead have diminished some. I do like this product and may have to use it but I wish they didn&#x27;t use palm oil.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this cream already seeing good results! Not too heavy or harsh on my skin love this cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an esthestian and strongly recommend this!</li>
    <li> My mother purchased this product not too long ago, and she liked it so much, she had me order another bottle, and even write a review! She applies it every night before bedtime. Just a little bit on the face and neck, and the rest is history. She says the cream feels really good and it is thick but not greasy. She says it smells great, and her skin already feels tighter and firmer. It&#x27;s not harsh on the skin like other retinol creams she has used. This retinol cream has definitely improved her complexion. Plus, she has sensitive skin (an issue with other products) and by only using this at night there weren&#x27;t ant problems. The enlarged pores are no more and the wrinkles are not apparent on her face. Even without make-up, she says her skin is smooth and fresh looking.</li>
    <li> I have bough two similar Retonal 2.5% products, another one is Serum 2.5% by  ASDM and used each one on half of my face so far for one week and haven&#x27;t seen any changes nor felt any sensation. compare with the different product with 1% Retonal which I used before, within few days I could see it was working and it caused to shed dry patches from the surface of my face. So comparing these two with the one I used before ( with much lower%) this product hasn&#x27;t done anything after one week of everyday used!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this product but I have tried the strongest 2.5% Retinol serum from Amazon. Can anyone tell which is better. I&#x27;ve heard you want just Retinol and this stuff has other \\&quot;good\\&quot; ingredients. So, I just want to know how this stuff compares to the serum. Please, help!.</li>
    <li> I love the way this product feels on my face,however it is too soon for me to see any positive results. I do think this is a great value given the price of other products on the market . No need to spend the big bucks on other products.&lt;br /&gt;If you are 50 + , retinol should be part of your total skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It does not work like a prescription grade but I think it still is effective.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking it was gonna be strong. It&#x27;s a dud. No results. I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST retinol product I have used and I have used just about all of them!  It sinks into your skin quickly and it&#x27;s not greasy.  Doesn&#x27;t really have a smell either and to be honest, it works just as well as another retinol that was 3 times the price.  The results and price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with this. This creme makes a difference within a week.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase more. I love it . I highly recommend it. Great product.</li>
    <li> This cream provides moisture and plumping to my face. I am waiting to see if wrinkles will diminish with further use.I follow with Watts Beauty Argan Oil mornings and nights. I have already recommended both to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have been using tretinoin in the past for my acne, but I was fortunate to take a chance on this when my prescription ran out.  It works just as well.</li>
    <li> Love it! There magic in this bottle! My scars have all but disappeared. My skin is even tone and tighter. I use it every night and wake up with soft, supple looking skin. The lines on my forehead have filled in too. Amazing product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it has 2.5% Retinol in it. I am pretty experienced with Retinol effects. I see and feel nothing with aspects to the retinol it claims to have.  I will stick with my tried and true. The price seemed to good to be true for it.</li>
    <li> I have used many creams . I really don&#x27;t see much difference in any of them. I am 59 and have no wrinkles so I can&#x27;t really say how it works on them. I do notice my skin feels tighter and has a glow.</li>
    <li> Great results. Price is right!</li>
    <li> I have used it for over a month and I do see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;It takes time, but it does work and I do see the fine lines&lt;br /&gt;going away.</li>
    <li> Feels good and seems to work well.  Price is a plus</li>
    <li> I like this product.  Feels good going on and no mess.  How much it has helped....not sure.  Would purchase from seller again</li>
    <li> not really any better a product than OTC retinol</li>
    <li> This is a very good cream, my skin feels softer and nicer after I use it regularly. It is not going to treat your fine lines or wrinkles or anything, I think, but it does nourish skin, making it softer, less stressed. I did not notice any sensitivity to light after it whatsoever. But I do always use a very high sunblock just because my skin is fair and pale. Overall, it is a good cream.</li>
    <li> love it but my face is so far gone it would take a miracle</li>
    <li> Has wheat germ oil init which causes terrible acne. Plus have to question the potency. It says it is 2.5 retinol I don&#x27;t believe so</li>
    <li> So far - have not seen any difference in my skin.  I am trying to give it a chance, but so far -nothing.  Unless I see some improvement over the next month, I am not going to buy again.  Just wish someone would come out with a product that really does work!  If anyone has found that miracle product, please don&#x27;t hesitate to share!!  (LOL)</li>
    <li> Not good for my face but great on my legs and hands. Burned my face and broke out my chest. However I apply it to my legs after I shave and my hands a couple times a day and both are very smooth and even</li>
    <li> magic potion seriously</li>
    <li> this seems to help the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Used consistently, there is minor improvement in skin tone and texture. Reduces minor wrinkles, but have to stay out of sun when using to avoid added vulnerability for spots and worse.</li>
    <li> I have several bad reviews about different products and also tried, but the results were satisfactory some of them were good, but that was costly too. Now found a perfect one cream at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Havent really noticed much difference from my other brand of retinol. Also seems a little greasy.  I think I will stick with  my other brand as I am acne prone and the other brand I use does not leave a greasy film.</li>
    <li> Creamy, &amp; light.  So far, good. Need more use to review how well it works.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> ummm........  I don&#x27;t really know yet.......  It feels good - it&#x27;s light and non-greasy.  I don&#x27;t know if I see any improvement or not.  Nobody else has commented on my skin looking better - yet!  I will keep using this bottle and aybe I just need some more time to notice a difference in my skin.......</li>
    <li> Does a great job.  A little peeling at first, but only took a few days to get used to this strength.</li>
    <li> I was amazed of the performance of this serum. At a fraction of the cost of Retriderm or any similar serum. Man or woman -  If you are over 45-50yo like me, care about your appearance, and want to remain youthful looking, then you owe it to yourself to invest in a high quality serum containing the proven ingredients of Hyaluronic Acid and Retinol. My personal dermatologist happens to treat some Hollywood&#x27;s best known stars who fly in to Dallas just to see her. She highly recommends all products like this serum that contain Retinol and Hyaluronic Acid. Hyaluronic Acid is a major building block with collagen to renew young skin and make wrinkles disappear. The Retinol (Vitamin A) acts as an exfoliate to remove dead skin. Use this product faithfully everyday at bedtime and only dampen your face by patting with a soft washcloth in the morning to keep the serum on your face. Give it a month. People will take notice that you look 5-7 years younger in 4 weeks. STAY OUT OF THE SUN!!!! Especially using products like this that are highly potent in Vitamin A.</li>
    <li> This my second bottle, great price vs retail stores, I am 63 and look 40, will continue to purchase in future.</li>
    <li> Great cream already seeing a difference in my skin. I Highly recommend this cream one of the best products I have used on my face.</li>
    <li> I got this to help with both fine wrinkles and acne/blackheads. It has softened my skin a lot in two months but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have helped a whole lot with the blackheads. It is fairly weak and hasn&#x27;t reddened my skin like strong retinols will. To me, that isn&#x27;t the best thing since I&#x27;d rather have something that works really well, but if you have sensitive skin, this is good for that.</li>
    <li> My doctor told me I had a vitamin-A deficiency, and I was looking for mottled pigmentation with this vitamin. Thanks to my friend who told me about it, she is using it for the past few months and having good results.</li>
