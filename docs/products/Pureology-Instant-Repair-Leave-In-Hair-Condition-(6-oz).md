      <li>Great product-I have been using for years to maintain healthy hair!</li>
      <li>This is a really good product.  </li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll love it!  </li>
      <li>Honestly, my hair was like straw wherever I put it on.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;What&#x27;s nice is that Pureology is never tested on animals and does not contain animal products,</li>
      <li>I normally love Pureology products, including their shampoos and conditioners.</li>
      <li>Mahes my hair look healthy and s</li>
      <li>Hair is healthy, longer, stronger and thicker.</li>
      <li>and I never put on more than 1 pump.  </li>
      <li>I love the Pureology shampoo/conditioner.</li>
      <li>There is nothing better.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance could be better...</li>
      <li>It was delivered on time and we love the product.</li>
      <li>I LOVE PUREOLGY</li>
      <li>It is not a &#x27;leave-in&#x27; conditioner, is more like a gel, and it doesn&#x27;t repair your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Instant repair is really a great product.  </li>
      <li>using product 3 weeks not finding it any better than other products I have used for frizz and fly away strands</li>
      <li>and I guess I got too excited about using the shampoo conditioner.</li>
      <li>This light formula tames my stray frizz and makes my hair super shiny.  </li>
      <li>Ok, I really wanted to like this.</li>
      <li>I have a drawer full of overpriced products that don&#x27;t do what they claim....  </li>
      <li>It does not live up to the purology superior hair care results.</li>
      <li>Pureology products are worth the money.</li>
      <li>It works  and that makes it worth the money...</li>
      <li>It is more like a clear gel, not a cream.</li>
      <li>ITS NOT AS GOOD AS HE OTHER STUFF</li>
      <li>and I find that it works much better on my \\&quot;natural\\&quot; hair than it did when I was always trying to straighten and blow dry longer, fine, frizz-prone hair.</li>
      <li>I actually received a sample of this and liked it so much I bought it..</li>
      <li>I had a perm in my hair and this product was really good to make it look less frizzy and over permed</li>
      <li>If this makes older “Mature” women’s hair look great just think what it will do for the younger set.</li>
      <li>I know its a mater of personal taste, but I think the light fragrance is fantastic too.</li>
      <li>I have purologies conditioner which I absolutely love, so I was expecting a similar type of feel.  </li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m still not sure it&#x27;s worth the high price; there are many products that offer adequate light</li>
      <li>I think it really depends on your hair type and the results you want.</li>
      <li>My hair has never had so much body...</li>
      <li>My hair is thinning and this has helped so much.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>It did not help my fine, dry hair texture at all.</li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s worth an extra star.</li>
      <li>I am new to using this brand</li>
      <li>It is more like a clear gel, it is incredibly sticky and smells horrible.</li>
      <li>It smells great, but even that was not worth anything as it left my hair dull.  </li>
      <li>I have long, thick hair, and live in a very humid place so this product has helped a lot in making it easy for me to care for my hair without weighing it down or making it greasy.</li>
      <li>It has tamed my dry, frizzy hair and made it very soft an manageable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure this is the right product ?</li>
      <li>Now that I have shorter, wavy hair that isn&#x27;t so badly heat damaged, the product works fairly well for me.</li>

<li> I noticed a difference immediately and now that I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months, my hair is much stronger and I have no more breakage.</li>
<li> When I first started to use this product, my hair was pretty badly damaged from heat and processing.</li>
<li> Apply after shower ,let it dry some and then comb it out.</li>

<li> I have long hair that is somewhat dry, sO if you have dry hair this product is not worth the money</li>
<li> However, this what not what I expected at all.</li>
<li> advice to people is to buy their regular conditioners and don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!  </li>
<li> product alone gives the whole Pureology line a really, really, really bad name.</li>
<li> This leave-in conditioner is very expensive but it lasts a very long time.  </li>
<li> This &amp;#34;leave-in&amp;#34; conditioner does not come cheap, so I do not appreciate how horrible and bad quality</li>
<li> I am very disappointed that I am stuck with 2 expensive bottles.</li>
<li> You will NOT be disappointed.</li>
<li> If you are thinking it will be anything like the Paul Mitchell leave-in conditioner, you will be disappointed.</li>
<li> BUT I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS LEAVE IN CONDITIONER.</li>

    <li> I wonder if this was shampoo instead of conditioner.  Honestly, my hair was like straw wherever I put it on.  It smells great, but even that was not worth anything as it left my hair dull.  I gave it to my sister and she had the same experience.</li>
    <li> Great product for overworked color treated hair!! The fragrance could be better... It works  and that makes it worth the money... I have a drawer full of overpriced products that don&#x27;t do what they claim....  I actually received a sample of this and liked it so much I bought it..</li>
    <li> This leave-in conditioner is very expensive but it lasts a very long time.  I like all of the Pureology products.</li>
    <li> Ok, I really wanted to like this. I love the Pureology shampoo/conditioner. I am new to using this brand and I guess I got too excited about using the shampoo conditioner. This &amp;#34;leave-in&amp;#34; conditioner does not come cheap, so I do not appreciate how horrible and bad quality it is.&lt;br /&gt;First off, it doesn&#x27;t feel like a &#x27;leave-in&#x27; conditioner. It is more like a clear gel, it is incredibly sticky and smells horrible. I would still be ALMOST ok with it if it at least left my hair feeling conditioned ( and REPAIRED) either after a few hours or after washing. NOT THE CASE.&lt;br /&gt;The hair gets all sticky (think cheapest styling gel you can find) and it STAYS that way EVEN after washing it!! I had to use shampoo three times before washing off the stickiness.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line WHY does this even exist. It is not a &#x27;leave-in&#x27; conditioner, is more like a gel, and it doesn&#x27;t repair your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product alone gives the whole Pureology line a really, really, really bad name.</li>
    <li> A bit pricey, but it works for me . Apply after shower ,let it dry some and then comb it out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is the right product ? It comes out like a sticky hair gel and drys like one too. Doesn&#x27;t feel like a conditioner ?</li>
    <li> No my hair is now drier then it was before. I have long hair that is somewhat dry, sO if you have dry hair this product is not worth the money&lt;br /&gt;Unhappy</li>
    <li> This is a really good product.  I have long, thick hair, and live in a very humid place so this product has helped a lot in making it easy for me to care for my hair without weighing it down or making it greasy.</li>
    <li> Mahes my hair look healthy and s great shine. I have been using this product for 12 years.</li>
    <li> I normally love Pureology products, including their shampoos and conditioners. However, this what not what I expected at all. If you are thinking it will be anything like the Paul Mitchell leave-in conditioner, you will be disappointed. It is more like a clear gel, not a cream. It did not help my fine, dry hair texture at all. I will continue to buy Pureology shampoo and conditioner but will avoid impulse buys like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I am updating this review and changing it from 1 star to 3, because I now have shorter, wavy hair and I find that it works much better on my \\&quot;natural\\&quot; hair than it did when I was always trying to straighten and blow dry longer, fine, frizz-prone hair. I think it really depends on your hair type and the results you want. Now that I have shorter, wavy hair that isn&#x27;t so badly heat damaged, the product works fairly well for me. But I&#x27;m still not sure it&#x27;s worth the high price; there are many products that offer adequate light conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s nice is that Pureology is never tested on animals and does not contain animal products, so that&#x27;s worth an extra star.</li>
    <li> I LOVE PUREOLGY BUT I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS LEAVE IN CONDITIONER. ITS NOT AS GOOD AS HE OTHER STUFF I HAVE PURCHASED FROM THE LINE.</li>
    <li> My hair has never had so much body...try it...you&#x27;ll love it!  There is nothing better.  My hair is thinning and this has helped so much.</li>
    <li> Hair is healthy, longer, stronger and thicker. Pureology products are worth the money. I have find hair that I dye on a every-month basis. You will NOT be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product wish you not have discontinued it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Instant repair is really a great product.  It has tamed my dry, frizzy hair and made it very soft an manageable.</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this stuff, her hair looks great for 60+ so I have given it great reviews. If this makes older “Mature” women’s hair look great just think what it will do for the younger set.</li>
    <li> Great product, our purchase went as advertised with no surprises. It was delivered on time and we love the product.</li>
    <li> I have purologies conditioner which I absolutely love, so I was expecting a similar type of feel.  This leave in condition falls up short.  I have hair that is about 4 inches below the shoulder.  I&#x27;ve tried this product several times.  It feels very sticky in my hands and when dried can leave my hair feeling stiff and I never put on more than 1 pump.  My hair is no easier to comb out than if I didn&#x27;t use the product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice to people is to buy their regular conditioners and don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!  They need to go back to the drawing board on this one.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, but recently it has been taken off the retail market. I was happy to find it on line. However, the product is not the same at all. I am very disappointed that I am stuck with 2 expensive bottles. It is not the same formula. It does not live up to the purology superior hair care results. It is sitting on my shelf.</li>
    <li> I use it after every shampoo.  I like that you can leave it in.  It protects my hair from the blowdryer and prevents dryness.</li>
