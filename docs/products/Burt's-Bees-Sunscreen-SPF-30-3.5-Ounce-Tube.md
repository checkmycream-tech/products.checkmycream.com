### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>, it seems to work best on hairless parts of the body.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also good to use on the backs of the hands.</li>
      <li>That said, I think this is a good product</li>
      <li>And I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m doing my body more harm than good by wearing it!</li>
      <li>It felt nice on my skin.</li>
      <li>The application was a bit problematic, since the sunblock was building up on my hands, kind of resembling calamine lotion.</li>
      <li>and I actually really liked it.</li>
      <li>It washes off VERY easily (even rainfall removes it).  </li>
      <li>So it comes off very easily, even just with sweat; don&#x27;t try swimming with it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect because the reviews are so varied and the experiences so diverse.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really glad I didn&#x27;t use it on my kids after reading the reviews as to its effectiveness with blocking the sun.  </li>
      <li>On top of that, it started flaking off</li>
      <li>Still had to rub it in more than \\&quot;regular\\&quot; sunscreen, but it was easier than most.  </li>
      <li>I will continue to look for a better product.</li>
      <li>It would be ok if I had lighter hair, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll see OXYBENZONE  in most sunscreens.</li>
      <li>I expect more for the price I paid.</li>
      <li>I will finish the tube, but will not buy any more of this.</li>
      <li>I like most Burt&#x27;s Bees products, so when I saw they had sunscreen</li>
      <li>and I mostly bought this to use as a preventative measure.</li>
      <li>This is a good product to implement as a daily routine for the more exposed parts of the body but maybe not so good if you&#x27;re going to be in the sun all day.</li>
      <li>It comes off fairly easily when you want it to, doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes like chemical sunscreens do, and it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue when it&#x27;s gone.</li>
      <li>She suggested Badger sunscreen... which oddly enough, I&#x27;d done some online research, and it got excellent reviews for being both natural AND effective, so</li>
      <li>It is so beautiful outside</li>
      <li>so I tried Burts because of chemical-free and have had no reactions and has protected fine.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s fine for the beach</li>
      <li>They shouldn&#x27;t put out a product at all if they haven&#x27;t mastered chemical free and easily absorbed/great at blocking the sun.</li>
      <li>First of all, I&#x27;m fair skinned and allergy prone, so this effects my experience with sunblocks right off the bat.&lt;br</li>
      <li>in all - look elsewhere for a chemical free sunscreen.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s important to use protective clothing and sunglasses to complement.</li>
      <li>It wouldn&#x27;t overpower a light perfume.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good natural sunscreen, keep looking because this product isn&#x27;t it.</li>
      <li>Do not buy this, and most certainly don&#x27;t trust it on your kids until you test a patch on yourself!</li>
      <li>Success!</li>
      <li>I liked that it&#x27;s tinted so it doesn&#x27;t look as white as many mainstream, naturally-sourced sunscreens.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used BBs lipbalm and handcream with good results, but a standard Trader Joe&#x27;s Sunscreen put this one to shame.</li>
      <li>this one went on pretty easily.</li>
      <li>Ingredient wise, there are sun blocks that are more safe (Badger, for example), but they are even more expensive than this.    </li>
      <li>I tried warming it with my fingers, but it dries to quickly for that to help.</li>
      <li>I have been a loyal fan and have forever bought their shampoos, conditioners, lip balms, etc...</li>
      <li>Because it washes off so easily, I didn&#x27;t really get to see how well it works as a sunscreen.</li>
      <li>and my skin is very sensitive; the chemicals in most sunscreens irritate my skin and</li>
      <li>I really would have rather dealt with an allergic reaction than the sunburn!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s waterproof, but water beaded up on it and rolled right off.</li>
      <li>And I was right.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t even tell you if it works, because I washed it right off.</li>
      <li>I have skin that burns easily and was looking for a natural sunscreen</li>
      <li>I was suspicious that it felt so hot</li>
      <li>I have been able to rub it in without leaving white showing.</li>
      <li>And it smells really good, but not a strong scent.</li>
      <li>When Clorox acquired Burt&#x27;s Bees in 2007 they quickly began to create tons of new products under the Burt&#x27;s Bees name.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t comment on how well it protects since I washed it off after the first hour of wearing it, but since it flaked off a lot, I doubt it offered much sun protection.    </li>
      <li>I am only grateful that I used chemical FULL sunscreen on the kids!  </li>
      <li>It absorbed very quickly and left my skin with a smooth, dry, matte finish.</li>
      <li>halfway to dinner realize I have white flakes on my arms, that I cannot brush off because I&#x27;m in his new most prized possession.  </li>
      <li>It works, is pleasant smelling, only leave a white haze depending on how much you apply, is not streaky, not messy, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it leaving marks on clothes).</li>
      <li>I contacted the company today and will be lightly digging through this weekends trash to send the receipt and crappy product back for a refund.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s also very burned.</li>
      <li>Also it&#x27;s not a product for layering as it can build up and leave residue if you use too much.</li>
      <li>Very inconsistent product line.</li>
      <li>I put this on my forearms before getting ready to run out the door for date night with the husband.  </li>
      <li>My whole family used it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not in the sun too much</li>
      <li>Very dissapointed.  </li>
      <li>And it starts to flake if you rub it in too much.</li>
      <li>in all I&#x27;d say that I&#x27;m pleased with this, as a natural product, however, I won&#x27;t be using it on a regular basis.</li>
      <li>I am newly pregnant and wanted to be super careful.</li>
      <li>Bought this at Target without reading any reviews because I love all of my other burt bees</li>
      <li>At first it was okay as I spread it on my face - but as soon as it sits for a few seconds it solidifies and doesn&#x27;t budge.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely need to wear sunscreen, so I had high hopes for Burt&#x27;s Bees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad that it&#x27;s natural, but to have spent around $15 at Pharmaca for this not to work is unacceptable.</li>
      <li>It left my face soft and looking as if I was wearing a light</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ve been trying some new ones.</li>
      <li>I get into his new car and</li>
      <li>&quot; They added a tint of yellow to make you think it wouldn&#x27;t turn you white - but it still looks bizarre.</li>
      <li>It is so NOT waterproof that, if there is a rivulet of sweat, as there always is when it&#x27;s hot, it will be a roadmap of burned areas amid the white areas where the sunscreen did not drip.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; sunscreens, so I know they are possible to make better than this.</li>
      <li>I spent about 6 hours in full sun, t-shirt and shorts.</li>
      <li>These new products do not meet the quality of the products originally developed by Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
      <li>It also gets stuck in the fine hairs around my temples and even a little bit in my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>Overall, it isn&#x27;t very greasy when it&#x27;s been rubbed in fully.</li>
      <li>About an hour after applying it, I noticed a white residue everywhere I had applied it that was very noticeable.</li>
      <li>Also, when I went to a reputable all-naturals type chain store today, one of the cashiers told me a lot of people complained about this sunscreen being ineffective.  </li>
      <li>No sunscreen is going to block the sun&#x27;s rays completely</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s slightly greasier than Neutrogena, but not nearly as bad as a sport sunblock.</li>
      <li>I have used Neutrogena Ultra Sheer sunblock for 8 years, but recently discovered that I was more or less slathering myself in cancer.</li>
      <li>Finally, my white tee shirts and cotton bras were all stained yellow after hot sweaty days in the garden.</li>
      <li>last summer I used Alba sunscreen and a few other brands that worked well, but they were perhaps not as \\&quot;natural\\&quot; as I would have liked them to be.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this as a daily facial sunscreen and cannot really comment on its effectiveness at preventing burns.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to find this sunscreen when I was in a small beach town with almost no other options for organic sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>We all have great base tans and only use sunscreen in full sun situations for long durations.</li>
      <li>I was expecting it to be white like other mineral sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried, it is yellow and will leave light yellow marks on your clothes.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always on the search for a natural sunscreen, after the things I&#x27;ve heard about the chemicals in traditional sunscreens.</li>
      <li>The only reason I gave it 2-stars is because it is a natural sunscreen and doesn&#x27;t contain Oxybenzene.</li>
      <li>It smells kind of funky and has a weird residue - almost sticky.  </li>
      <li>In fact, the more you rub it in, the worse it looks.</li>
      <li>Not a very nice chemical (absorbed through the skin).</li>
      <li>At first I thought I was peeling, but then I realized that even after a vigorous shower with a loofa, it was this sunscreen pilling off my skin as I dried off and applied moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I apply in small amts and 1yo has little surface area anyway :)</li>
      <li>My skin is very chemical-sensitive -- I&#x27;ve developed rashes to three other \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; sunscreens so far this year and countless others in the past -- so I was looking forward to this one as perhaps \\&quot;the one.\\&quot;</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get past the smell. I use other organic and all-natural sunscreens that I like. This one smells so bad I can&#x27;t take it. It&#x27;s also the least blendable I&#x27;ve ever worked with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> My skin is very chemical-sensitive -- I&#x27;ve developed rashes to three other \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; sunscreens so far this year and countless others in the past -- so I was looking forward to this one as perhaps \\&quot;the one.\\&quot; I was willing to put up with the thick, sticky application and feel if it worked. The smell, kind of like those banana candies, wasn&#x27;t awful -- I could live with it. Then I noticed that it DOESN&#x27;T WASH OFF. At first I thought I was peeling, but then I realized that even after a vigorous shower with a loofa, it was this sunscreen pilling off my skin as I dried off and applied moisturizer. Finally, my white tee shirts and cotton bras were all stained yellow after hot sweaty days in the garden. That&#x27;s it. Yet another sunscreen into the trash can and that I will never buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a pale person. I burn within 20 minutes on a sunny day. I have used Neutrogena Ultra Sheer sunblock for 8 years, but recently discovered that I was more or less slathering myself in cancer. So, I decided to try this out.    Pros: It works. I put it on my face in the morning (under my makeup) and I don&#x27;t get burned. Success! And it smells really good, but not a strong scent. It wouldn&#x27;t overpower a light perfume. And it&#x27;s yellow, so you can tell where you put it!    Cons: It&#x27;s difficult to rub in fully. I tried warming it with my fingers, but it dries to quickly for that to help. And it starts to flake if you rub it in too much. I think I still need practice. It also gets stuck in the fine hairs around my temples and even a little bit in my eyebrows. It would be ok if I had lighter hair, but I don&#x27;t. I also thought it gave my face a slightly yellowish tint (I&#x27;m pretty pink).    Overall, it isn&#x27;t very greasy when it&#x27;s been rubbed in fully. It&#x27;s slightly greasier than Neutrogena, but not nearly as bad as a sport sunblock. And I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m doing my body more harm than good by wearing it!</li>
    <li> I got this sunscreen hoping to use it in place of my usual Neutrogena on my face. I have been on Retin-A and my skin is very sensitive; the chemicals in most sunscreens irritate my skin and and I absolutely need to wear sunscreen, so I had high hopes for Burt&#x27;s Bees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s horrible. At first it was okay as I spread it on my face - but as soon as it sits for a few seconds it solidifies and doesn&#x27;t budge. It feels like wearing a clay mask, very tight. Oh, and I look like a clown even though the bottle specifically says \\&quot;non-whitening.\\&quot; They added a tint of yellow to make you think it wouldn&#x27;t turn you white - but it still looks bizarre. I can&#x27;t imagine it would blend well on any skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use it now to go in the backyard for a few hours when no one will see me - I can&#x27;t imagine trying to put makeup on over this cakey mess. But if you read the back of the bottle, it says to remove the sunscreen with water. So it comes off very easily, even just with sweat; don&#x27;t try swimming with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the pros, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t smell terrible. I haven&#x27;t gotten burned like some people, but I also don&#x27;t stay in the sun very long and I wear hats as well. It comes off fairly easily when you want it to, doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes like chemical sunscreens do, and it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue when it&#x27;s gone. (But that&#x27;s not much of a good thing when you want to be active outside.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all - look elsewhere for a chemical free sunscreen.</li>
    <li> One of the few sunscreens I can now apply to my sensitive skin. Works well.</li>
    <li> I hated this sunscreen. I&#x27;ve used other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; sunscreens, so I know they are possible to make better than this. Like the other reviewers said, it leaves a chalky white mess everywhere you touch, and if you try to apply it thickly (like you are supposed to) it starts pilling off your skin almost immediately. I put some on my baby, and almost immediately had to wash it off because he felt dirty and looked dirty. Now I read it doesn&#x27;t work? And it was super expensive. I returned mine to the store I bought it from and got a refund and told them not to purchase that anymore. I&#x27;m sad that yet another Burt&#x27;s Bees product has let me down. Very inconsistent product line.</li>
    <li> I buy lots of organic and all-natural type products for health-related reasons... last summer I used Alba sunscreen and a few other brands that worked well, but they were perhaps not as \\&quot;natural\\&quot; as I would have liked them to be.  So when I found that Burt&#x27;s Bees made sunscreen, I was elated.  I have been a loyal fan and have forever bought their shampoos, conditioners, lip balms, etc... no problems there.    Anyway, I got the WORST sunburn I have EVER had while using this sunscreen.  And I know how to apply sunscreen... I&#x27;ve used other kinds and NOT burned, so I doubt it&#x27;s a user-error... especially after reading some similar reviews on here.  Also, when I went to a reputable all-naturals type chain store today, one of the cashiers told me a lot of people complained about this sunscreen being ineffective.  She suggested Badger sunscreen... which oddly enough, I&#x27;d done some online research, and it got excellent reviews for being both natural AND effective, so I&#x27;m going to use that next time.    I will probably stop buying Burt&#x27;s Bees products altogether because I contacted their customer service, and I got an auto-reply, followed up two days later by something similar to \\&quot;Sorry you were disappointed in the product, we&#x27;ll let someone in Product Development know\\&quot;...  I just got the impression they don&#x27;t care that I trusted their product and it failed.</li>
    <li> Although the sunscreen seems to work well, it smells so bad that I threw the tube out after only using it once.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping that it would be comparable to the California Baby sunscreen that I&#x27;ve used before. Instead, the Burt&#x27;s Bees product is thick and doesn&#x27;t blend in well. In fact, the more you rub it in, the worse it looks. I can&#x27;t even tell you if it works, because I washed it right off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used BBs lipbalm and handcream with good results, but a standard Trader Joe&#x27;s Sunscreen put this one to shame. As the other reviewers wrote, this sunscreen is sticky-feeling, doesn&#x27;t rub in well, and leaves your skin with a white tint. I&#x27;m glad that it&#x27;s natural, but to have spent around $15 at Pharmaca for this not to work is unacceptable. Skip it!</li>
    <li> I bought this and then read the reviews on it.  Mistake.  I put this on my forearms before getting ready to run out the door for date night with the husband.  I get into his new car and halfway to dinner realize I have white flakes on my arms, that I cannot brush off because I&#x27;m in his new most prized possession.  It goes on thick and you have to rub it in a little, I could deal with that if it weren&#x27;t for the flakes.  I can&#x27;t say how well it blocks the sun because I only got incidental sun to and from car and house.  I&#x27;m really glad I didn&#x27;t use it on my kids after reading the reviews as to its effectiveness with blocking the sun.  I expect more for the price I paid. They shouldn&#x27;t put out a product at all if they haven&#x27;t mastered chemical free and easily absorbed/great at blocking the sun.</li>
    <li> This product is horrible. I am a big Burt&#x27;s Bee fan but this one has made me rethink it all! It has some weird ingredient (has a long name that I dont remember) in it and so does not spread out evenly on skin, thus leaving white spots - like we put tons of powder on him or something. Really hard to apply. Hate it!!! And what I hate more is that the customer service for the company was extremely unhelpful and unsymapthetic!!! They said they had heard this before and could do nothing!  Don&#x27;t buy it, you will regret it!</li>
    <li> My daughter burned so badly after using this that I wanted to call the company. She is now peeling terribly.    It is so NOT waterproof that, if there is a rivulet of sweat, as there always is when it&#x27;s hot, it will be a roadmap of burned areas amid the white areas where the sunscreen did not drip. I understand that if it&#x27;s not waterproof, you need to reapply, but this is ridiculous.</li>
    <li> Terrible product. I purchased this sunscreen because I was looking for a possibly cheaper alternative to the mineral-based sunscreen I have been using. After trying it once I will not be using it again.  It did not work well at all and I&#x27;m only giving it one star because I have to, I would prefer to give it none.    Reasons for product rating:  1. It washes off VERY easily (even rainfall removes it).  2. Because it washes off so easily, I didn&#x27;t really get to see how well it works as a sunscreen. Useless. Also, when it gets wet it starts to look like your covered in drippy white paint.  3. It&#x27;s messy and comes off on EVERYTHING. Once you have it on your hands expect to leave marks or traces everywhere.  4. Don&#x27;t wear white and wear this sunscreen! I was expecting it to be white like other mineral sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried, it is yellow and will leave light yellow marks on your clothes.  5. It smells kind of funky and has a weird residue - almost sticky.  6. It is streaky. Because it&#x27;s mineral based I was expecting to get that \\&quot;hazy white\\&quot; look, but this leaves white streaks.     I will continue using what I have been as a mineral sunscreen (I currently use Badger 15 SPF &amp; 30 SPF and have not had any problems with it. It works, is pleasant smelling, only leave a white haze depending on how much you apply, is not streaky, not messy, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it leaving marks on clothes).</li>
    <li> I bought this at CVS for $15 on Saturday while we went to the beach. I put it on before I left the house so it would have plenty of time to soak in. The only reason I tried this stuff is b/c I am newly pregnant and wanted to be super careful. After only an hour and 45 minutes at the beach I am as red as a tomato on several parts of the top 1/2 of my body and a weird spot on my ankle. I spent about 20 minutes putting it all over so I know I had sunscreen everywhere. I even applied to my shoulder again while we were at the beach b/c I was suspicious that it felt so hot and it&#x27;s also very burned. I contacted the company today and will be lightly digging through this weekends trash to send the receipt and crappy product back for a refund.</li>
    <li> Bottom line: This stuff does not work. It is sticky, very hard to apply and offers no burn protection! When Clorox acquired Burt&#x27;s Bees in 2007 they quickly began to create tons of new products under the Burt&#x27;s Bees name. These new products do not meet the quality of the products originally developed by Burt&#x27;s Bees. Clorox has cannibalized Burt&#x27;s Bees for profit.</li>
    <li> Very dissapointed.  Bought this at Target without reading any reviews because I love all of my other burt bees products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I DO NOT love this one. I have skin that burns easily and was looking for a natural sunscreen so I wasn&#x27;t getting skin cancer from chemicals either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rubbed this on, very thick, doesn&#x27;t rub on easily and took me a long time to get it all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went riding for a few hours, came home to find my shoulders and arms are red raw, just like I didn&#x27;t even put sunscreen on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really NOT HAPPY!</li>
    <li> If you want to fry then by this product.  I got the worst sunburn ever.  My whole family used it and I was the only one who reapplied after every dip in the water.  My husband and daughter who did not reapply, go less sunburned than I did.  I think that the distribution of active ingredients in the tube are poor.  Also all the oils in the product does not help.  We all have great base tans and only use sunscreen in full sun situations for long durations.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find this sunscreen when I was in a small beach town with almost no other options for organic sunscreen.  Boy, was I disappointed. I got an awful sunburn.  Worst I&#x27;ve had in years. I will say that compared to other organic sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;m allergic to regular kinds so I&#x27;ve tried a lot of brands) this one went on pretty easily. Still had to rub it in more than \\&quot;regular\\&quot; sunscreen, but it was easier than most.  I reapplied it multiple times throughout the day, but even with all the reapplying, I could still FEEL myself getting sunburned.  And I was right.  I got the worst sunburn I have had in years, despite reapplying excessively.  Save your money and buy another brand! I really would have rather dealt with an allergic reaction than the sunburn!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not in the sun too much and I mostly bought this to use as a preventative measure. I use this daily eventhough I work in an office b/c dermatologists recommend that you use sunscreen regardless if you plan on being in the sun or not. That said, I think this is a good product and I actually really liked it. I&#x27;ve never tried laying out in the beach all day and relying on this product alone. The hemp seed oil base is very soothing and luxurious and it blends well on the face and neck, especially after cleansing. I find that it doesn&#x27;t get too oily throughout the day either. It&#x27;s also good to use on the backs of the hands. I liked that it&#x27;s tinted so it doesn&#x27;t look as white as many mainstream, naturally-sourced sunscreens. I have tried it on other parts of my body like my arms and it doesn&#x27;t blend as well, it seems to work best on hairless parts of the body. Also it&#x27;s not a product for layering as it can build up and leave residue if you use too much. I would recommend this sunscreen for face and neck but take other preventative measures as well. No sunscreen is going to block the sun&#x27;s rays completely so it&#x27;s important to use protective clothing and sunglasses to complement. This is a good product to implement as a daily routine for the more exposed parts of the body but maybe not so good if you&#x27;re going to be in the sun all day.</li>
    <li> Pro- I spent about 6 hours in full sun, t-shirt and shorts. I applied once and sweated heavily the rest of the day. I did not get sunburned. Yes, it leaves a white sheen which eventually gives you a &#x27;dusted&#x27; look where it&#x27;s applied, but in my case it didn&#x27;t rub away.    It has a slight Play-Doh smell, which I don&#x27;t mind.    Con- There a couple of ingredients in this product I&#x27;d rather not have on me, which I&#x27;m hoping they are at least, naturally derived. And it&#x27;s a bit expensive for the amount you get. I probably used half the bottle at this one outing.      Ingredient wise, there are sun blocks that are more safe (Badger, for example), but they are even more expensive than this.    Avoid any sunscreen that is sprayed on or is a powder.    Avoid any sunscreen with vitamin A (look for \\&quot;retinyl palmitate\\&quot; or \\&quot;retinol\\&quot;). Everyone by now knows vitamin A is a photocarcinogenic (it makes your skin vulnerable to UV, substantially increasing your risk of skin cancer).    Avoid any sunscreen with ooctylmethoxycinnamate, octrocrylene, oxybenzone, 4-MBC, or Padimate O. You&#x27;ll see OXYBENZONE  in most sunscreens. Not a very nice chemical (absorbed through the skin).</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as an alternative to chemical sunscreens. The only reason I gave it 2-stars is because it is a natural sunscreen and doesn&#x27;t contain Oxybenzene. Otherwise, I don&#x27;t like this at all. As others have stated, it is waxy-feeling, and doesn&#x27;t absorb into skin. It leaves my skin feeling dry and taut. Also, it stained my white capris.     I will finish the tube, but will not buy any more of this. I will continue to look for a better product.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen has a thick, tacky consistency that causes a very unpleasant sensation when applied to the skin. It&#x27;s very difficult to blend in and whitens the face considerably. I have been using this as a daily facial sunscreen and cannot really comment on its effectiveness at preventing burns. However, it feels so gross on my skin that I would never purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints with this product. I agree it doesn&#x27;t spread as well as coppertone etal but my 1yr old had reaction to coppertone even though none of my other kids have so I tried Burts because of chemical-free and have had no reactions and has protected fine. I have been able to rub it in without leaving white showing. I apply in small amts and 1yo has little surface area anyway :)</li>
    <li> I put this on my arms prior to going to the beach.  I had never used this before, and so didn&#x27;t trust it for my kids.  I put another suncreen on them, then finished up with putting the same sunscreen I used for my kids on my legs and face.  After a morning at the beach ONLY my arms were burned.  I haven&#x27;t had a burn in years due to faithful sunscreen use!  I am only grateful that I used chemical FULL sunscreen on the kids!  They didn&#x27;t get even the slightest bit pink.  Do not buy this, and most certainly don&#x27;t trust it on your kids until you test a patch on yourself!</li>
    <li> We decided to try this stuff and it did not work at all.  It made our skin all white and it was like rubbing elmers glue onto our skin.  Then we got badly burned anyways.  The burn is ruining this weekend.  It is so beautiful outside and I am stuck in the house.</li>
    <li> My favorite sunblocks have been hard to come by lately so I&#x27;ve been trying some new ones. Burt&#x27;s Bees is one I&#x27;ve been eyeballing for awhile and I finally purchased it. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect because the reviews are so varied and the experiences so diverse. First of all, I&#x27;m fair skinned and allergy prone, so this effects my experience with sunblocks right off the bat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As one might expect, Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s isn&#x27;t the creamy texture one may be accustomed to. It&#x27;s thick and waxy. No surprise there. It has a pungent scent. It took me back immediately to tide pools in Maine, as a kid with my grandmother, collecting sea shells and marveling at starfish. That&#x27;s fine for the beach or if you&#x27;re going to be out in the open all day, but it&#x27;s not a scent I want to carry with me on a daily basis. It absorbed very quickly and left my skin with a smooth, dry, matte finish. It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or tacky or greasy. It felt nice on my skin. It left my face soft and looking as if I was wearing a light foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s waterproof, but water beaded up on it and rolled right off. The application was a bit problematic, since the sunblock was building up on my hands, kind of resembling calamine lotion. Once I had that worked in, I found that I couldn&#x27;t touch anything without leaving a waxy residue. That&#x27;s another reason why I wouldn&#x27;t wear this daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;d say that I&#x27;m pleased with this, as a natural product, however, I won&#x27;t be using it on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always on the search for a natural sunscreen, after the things I&#x27;ve heard about the chemicals in traditional sunscreens. I like most Burt&#x27;s Bees products, so when I saw they had sunscreen I bought it immediately. When applying it, I noticed it was difficult to blend and rub in, and it just felt thick and heavy. About an hour after applying it, I noticed a white residue everywhere I had applied it that was very noticeable. On top of that, it started flaking off so I was covered in white, flakey residue. I can&#x27;t comment on how well it protects since I washed it off after the first hour of wearing it, but since it flaked off a lot, I doubt it offered much sun protection.    Bottom line, I don&#x27;t recommend this. If you&#x27;re looking for a good natural sunscreen, keep looking because this product isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> Horrible! bought this and took it to the beach only to find that it clumped as i rubbed it on my baby&#x27;s skin. I had to resort to using Neutrogenas baby sunscreen which I was not happy about. Just wrote the company a message on their site and im not waiting for a response.</li>
    <li> It just didn&#x27;t work. I put it on 30 minutes for being outdoors and reapplied faithfully every hour, and I&#x27;m sitting here with the worst burn I&#x27;ve had since I was a kid.</li>
