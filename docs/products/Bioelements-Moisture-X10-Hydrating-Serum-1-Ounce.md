      <li>And was happy with it.</li>
      <li>Love it!!</li>
      <li>Absolutely perfect, product is perfect delivery was quick</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I usually love Bioelement products but this did not moisturize my skin like I hoped.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like magic.</li>
      <li>This is more like a serum than anything else.</li>
      <li>The more my skin ages (I&#x27;m 66), the more moisture it needs.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels and looks better.</li>
      <li>I am sure</li>
      <li>I love this stuff</li>
      <li>(and this is why I give it 4 rather than 5 stars) is that the pump stops being effective when the bottle is still 25% full.  </li>
      <li>The price was good and delivery fast.</li>
      <li>But even given that hassle, I have purchased this time and time again, and am a very loyal fan.</li>
      <li>Very good for dry skin.</li>
      <li>I first bought it in an upscale salon and paid a lot more for it than I did on Amazon.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for extremely dry skin.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it</li>
      <li>This product wasn&#x27;t worth the money.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth without any greasy residue.</li>
      <li>I found this better to use at night with a light moisturizer over it, or under a sunscreen with no top moisturizer for the day.</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t feel it really worked well on my skin.  </li>
      <li>and while I realize that it may not work as well for every skin type (very young skin - oily skin )</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and soaks in if you use a little bit.</li>
      <li>Most moisturizers and skin care products actually irritate my skin, but this one heals it and definitely moisturizes and helps to preserve my skin in a very dry climate.  </li>
      <li>No greasy effect just soft moist skin.  </li>
      <li>This product instantly improves my complexion, and reduces fine lines due to dehydrated skin.</li>
      <li>Really helps with dry patches.</li>
      <li>My wife finds it to be a very effective moisturizer, but it is almost impossible to get the contents at the bottom of the jar through the pump.</li>
      <li>Probaby too heavy for hot humid summer weather.</li>

<li> This serum is just what my dry skin needed over the winter.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a great product for extremely dry skin.  It does not irritate my rosacea either. You may need a second step moisturizer during the winter months. This is more like a serum than anything else. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Helps hold moisture in all day. No greasy effect just soft moist skin.  I will order it again I am sure</li>
    <li> You know how sometimes you want a light moisture lotion and sometimes faces can get affected by wind or cold burn. This takes care of both cases. It&#x27;s like magic. Love this stuff.</li>

    <li> I like it . I use this product at night.</li>
    <li> Bought this product from a recommendation by my estheticion. A little goes a long way! Really helps with dry patches.</li>
    <li> A must have before applying any moisturizer</li>
    <li> Best moisture retaining product ever. Have used it for several years. Non greasy, non sticky.</li>
    <li> If I had to choose only one skin care product to use, this would be it. This moisture serum soaks into my skin and I can feel the difference immediately. My skin loves it. The more my skin ages (I&#x27;m 66), the more moisture it needs.  Bioelements is the perfect product along with lots of water. I can&#x27;t say enough for this serum that hydrates and smoothed my skin.</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect, product is perfect delivery was quick</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and I always will. I first bought it in an upscale salon and paid a lot more for it than I did on Amazon. Now I buy from Amazon because it&#x27;s much less expensive. This product helps your moisturizer to hold to your skin and forms a moisture barrier. Very good for dry skin. Use this in winter when it&#x27;s cold and dry. Probaby too heavy for hot humid summer weather. Although I use it then too sometimes. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it and while I realize that it may not work as well for every skin type (very young skin - oily skin ) I know it&#x27;s kept my skin from flaking off and blowing away</li>
    <li> I was not satisfied at all.. My wife had purchased one previously at an actually Store. And was happy with it. After running out I ordered this online , and was disappointed not sure if its a bootleg.  Be ware</li>
    <li> This has turned my dry tired face around in 6 months.</li>
    <li> This product wasn&#x27;t worth the money.  It is hard to get out and I didn&#x27;t feel it really worked well on my skin.  I usually love Bioelement products but this did not moisturize my skin like I hoped.  I will not reorder.</li>
    <li> If your skin is dry, this is definitely the product for you. But use caution. A little goes a long way. I found this better to use at night with a light moisturizer over it, or under a sunscreen with no top moisturizer for the day. It&#x27;s light and soaks in if you use a little bit. But you do have to give it a minute before putting making on over it.</li>
    <li> My wife finds it to be a very effective moisturizer, but it is almost impossible to get the contents at the bottom of the jar through the pump. The price was good and delivery fast.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like a drink of water for my face. This product instantly improves my complexion, and reduces fine lines due to dehydrated skin. It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth without any greasy residue. I definitely would, and have recommended it to others!</li>
    <li> This serum moisturizes deep down and keeps the face from cracking or feeling too dry. I&#x27;ve used it for several years after it was recommended by an anesthetician.</li>
    <li> This serum is just what my dry skin needed over the winter. My skin feels and looks better. I definitely would recommend this for people with dry skin and follow up with moisturizer.</li>
