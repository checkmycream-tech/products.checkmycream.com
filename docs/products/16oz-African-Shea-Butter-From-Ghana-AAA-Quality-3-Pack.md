    <li> I have been using this shea butter for a couple of years, and I find it is the best moisturizer on the market. Whether battling the sub-zero temperatures in the mid-west or desert temperatures on the Pacific Coast.</li>
    <li> The product actually exceeded my expectations. I plan to reorder product&lt;br /&gt;In the future.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks...</li>
    <li> Came in a timely fashion. Great for my skin.</li>
    <li> Use on my skin which can get so dry it aches during the winter. I slather this everywhere on me. It does feel thick when rubbed in so I just make sure to do it at night before bed and walk around naked. Also use on my dog&#x27;s elbows in the summer. He has dandruff issues and his skin can get super dry. Rubbing some on every other day does wonders.&lt;br /&gt;Can be really hard to first dig some out but the more the tub is used the more it seems to soften up.</li>
